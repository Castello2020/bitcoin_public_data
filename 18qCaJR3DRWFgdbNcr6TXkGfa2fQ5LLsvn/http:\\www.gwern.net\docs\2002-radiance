<blockquote>
<p>Somewhere in California, in the 1990s, a nuclear weapons lab develops advanced technologies for its post-Cold War mission. Advanced as in <em>not working yet</em>. Mission as in <em>continued funding</em>. A scandal-plagued missile defense program presses forward, dragging physicist Philip <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%20%28computing%29" title="Wikipedia: Quine (computing)">Quine</a> deep into the machinations of those who would use the lab for their own gain.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has collapsed. But new enemies are sought, and new reasons found to continue the work that has legitimized the power of the Lab, its managers, and the politicians who fund them. Quine is thrust into the center of programs born at the intersection of paranoia, greed, and ambition, and torn by incommensurable demands. Deadlines slip and cost overruns mount. He is drawn into a maelstrom of policy meetings, classified documents, petty betrayals, interrupted conversations, missed meanings, unanswered voicemail, stolen data, and pornographic files. Amid all the noise and static of the late twentieth century made manifest in weapons and anti-weapons, human beings have set in motion a malign and inhuman reality, which now is beyond their control.</p>
<p>More than a critique of corrupt science and a permanent wartime economy, <em>Radiance</em> is a novel of lost ideals, broken aspirations, and human costs. In this vivid satire, relationships are just a question of who‚Äôs using whom. Failure is just another word for opportunity. ‚ÄúSpin‚Äù is a property not of atomic particles but of the news cycle. Nature is a blur beyond the windshield, where lives are spent on the road, on the phone, on the make, in fierce competition for financial, political, and intellectual resources. It is a world which language is used to evade, manipulate, and expedite. It is a world where everyone‚Äôs story is always open to revision and language is used for justifying everything from defense programs to divorce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúA tour de force of obsessive, microscopic realism and a vibrantly satirical phantasmagoria at once. It gives a terrifying glimpse of a war at the juncture of science and politics, one never fully fought or abandoned, only covered in denial and fatigue. It reads like a declassified document of the human soul.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúCarter Scholz‚Äôs laser-beam prose is combustible upon contact, so stimulating that - as you take it in - you can actually feel your synapses overloading with halogen-clear brilliance. <em>Radiance</em> is provocative, riveting, funny, but above all else, it is startlingly unique.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚ÄìDAVID GRAND, author of <em>The Disappearing Body</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI doubt there‚Äôs another writer in the country who can match Scholz as a stylist. <em>Radiance</em> is a splendid evocation of time and place. Beautiful, funny, and scary, too, it‚Äôs every bit as brilliant as the name implies.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThis beautiful and disturbing novel is a superb rendering of our strategic defense weapons programs and of the America that supports them. It‚Äôs fiction about science in service to fictions, a coherent beam that illuminates our world in a new way. Scholz‚Äôs ear for American speech, and the precision of his language, remind me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Gaddis" title="Wikipedia: William Gaddis">Gaddis</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy%20Davenport" title="Wikipedia: Guy Davenport">Davenport</a>, or Pynchon, but here the high modernist brilliance is put to urgent political use.‚Äù</p>

<p>[pg3] Quine approached the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory" title="Wikipedia: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory">Lab</a> on a road that led nowhere else. The morning light was thick, almost a substance. Past the razorwire of the perimeter fence, cranes and water towers and incinerator stacks rose above the fortress city‚Äôs sprawl of buildings. Construction vehicles moved on its roads. Beyond, grassland stretched to hillsides sallow from drought and spotted with dark stands of live oak.</p>
<p>Soon he saw the protesters blocking the gate. Cars in both lanes had stopped. The blue lights and red lights of patrol cars flickered on the road‚Äôs shoulders. Blackclad police formed a line between the protesters and the gate. Over chanting, rhythmic but unintelligible, rang a bullhorn‚Äôs clipped commands, and the protesters moved off the roadway, the rhythm of their chant stumbling. A few remained kneeling in the road before the gate. Three police holstered their batons and moved respectfully among the kneeling protesters, like acolytes among devouts, helping them one by one to their feet and leading them within the gates to a waiting bus. The sequence of blockade, arrest, and release was by now ritual. The arrested chatted with their captors.</p>
<p>As the cars edged forward, Quine saw once again the darkhaired young woman in the crowd and once again felt the hollowing of his heart. Her resemblance to Kate, any reminder of Kate, still lanced him.</p>
<p>Two cars ahead, Leo Highet‚Äôs<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> red convertible sounded its horn as Highet leaned out to heckle, ‚ÄìGet a life! The woman flinched and Quine‚Äôs eyes locked on Highet‚Äôs head, the bald spot, the wedge of features [pg4] visible in the rearview mirror, the broad nose and dark glasses. Once through the gate Highet‚Äôs car sped into a right turn to the administration building while Quine drove on to the second checkpoint, then through a desert of broken rock, buried mines, and motion sensors erect on metal stalks like unliving plants. Past this dry moat he stopped at a third checkpoint, then parked in the shade of a concrete building with blank walls and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrasure" title="Wikipedia: Embrasure">embrasured</a> windows, and nervously thumbed the car radio, ‚Äìaffic and weather togeth, while he watched two younger scientists cross the lot and enter the building. Then he stilled the car and went in.</p>
<p>In his office, one horizontal window too high to reach framed an oblong of sky. On the walls, abandoned by the prior occupant and by Quine untouched, hung graphs and pictures, seismographs of bomb tests, the branched coils of particle decay, a geological map, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electron%20micrographs" title="Wikipedia: electron micrographs">electron micrographs</a> of molecular etchings, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal%23Natural%20phenomena%20with%20fractal%20features" title="Wikipedia: Fractal#Natural phenomena with fractal features">fractal</a> mountainscape, all overlaid by memos, monthly construction maps, field test schedules, Everyone Needs To Know About Classification, cartoons, Curiosity Is Not A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need%20To%20Know" title="Wikipedia: Need To Know">Need To Know</a>, whiteboard thick with equations in four colors so long unwiped that Quine‚Äôs one pass with a wet rag had left the symbols down one edge ghosted but not erased, and a second desk, loose papers cascaded across its surface, the computer monitor topped by a seamsplit cardboard carton <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringer%20Vineyards" title="Wikipedia: Beringer Vineyards">BERINGER</a> GREY <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesling" title="Wikipedia: Riesling">RIESLING</a> and buttressed by books manuals folders xeroxes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive%20Modeling" title="Wikipedia: Autoregressive Modeling">Autoregressive Modeling</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring%20%28mathematics%29" title="Wikipedia: Ring (mathematics)">Rings</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field%20%28mathematics%29" title="Wikipedia: Field (mathematics)">Fields</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group%20%28mathematics%29" title="Wikipedia: Group (mathematics)">Groups</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%20da%20Vinci%23Journals%20and%20notes" title="Wikipedia: Leonardo da Vinci#Journals and notes">Leonardo da Vinci Notebooks</a><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, Numerical Solution of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential%20Equations" title="Wikipedia: Differential Equations">Differential Equations</a>, Selling Yourself and Your Ideas! and under the desk banker‚Äôs boxes DESTROY AFTER, and D NULL in black marker. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2Fdev%2Fnull" title="Wikipedia: /dev/null">Devon Null</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, the prior occupant, was ‚Äúon indefinite leave‚Äù. But when Quine had moved in, Highet had insisted that he leave Null‚Äôs half of the office untouched, either against Null‚Äôs return or, as Quine was coming to believe, as a monument to disappearance.</p>
<p>Quine checked his computer mail. Most of the messages were notices, chaffing, power plays, trivia.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>As you know, the Beltway boys are coming and it is CRUCIAL that they go home awed. I want confidence, energy and style. There are unanswered questions and we will take hits on those. Meeting at noon today to brainstorm our approach, bldg 101, rm E-501.</p>
<p>Highet</p>
<p>‚Äî- ‚ÄúTo apply and direct this vast new potential of destructive energy excited the inventive genius of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%20da%20Vinci" title="Wikipedia: Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo</a> as had few other enterprises.‚Äù ‚Äî-</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More galling than the message was Highet‚Äôs new computer login <em>sforza</em> and his signature quote. The inspirational conceit, that they were all Renaissance maestri under the gentle patronage of Prince Leo the High, had come ironically from Quine, who was reading about da Vinci‚Äôs eighteen years as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military%20engineer" title="Wikipedia: military engineer">military engineer</a> under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico%20Sforza" title="Wikipedia: Ludovico Sforza">Ludovico Sforza</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke%20of%20Milan" title="Wikipedia: Duke of Milan">Duke of Milan</a>. Leonardo had written, ‚ÄúI hate war, as all rational men hate it, but there seems no escape from its bestial madness.‚Äù Not while men of genius bend their talents to it, Quine had added. Here was Highet‚Äôs comeback.</p>
<p>Highet. What a piece of work. Builder and destroyer of his own legend. A fecund theorist but a distracted experimenter, an indifferent administrator but a champion politician. From the start of his career he had traveled to the capital, made himself known to congressmen and their staffs. In reward for such attentions he was at a young age appointed technical representative to a disarmament conference. His conduct was impeccable until one afternoon, goaded by the other side‚Äôs mendacious presentation and by his own ungovernable need to command the center of every situation, he let slip classified data<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Highet made allies sooner than friends, and enemies sooner than either. After this gaffe his allies were silent while his enemies pounced. [pg6] But Highet made the first of the hairsbreadth escapes on which his legend was built. A paper published a year before, cosigned by the President‚Äôs science advisor, had exposed the same secret. The hearings were dropped and Highet was exiled to an underfunded oubliette of the Lab housed in temporary trailers: J Section.</p>
<p>Anyone else would have languished there. But Highet built by inches a power base, using his charisma to attract the brightest, most driven graduate students he could find, forming in the meantime new political alliances. When Congress at last funded Radiance, all the necessary talent was in J Section, and fiercely loyal to Highet. Soon he was associate director. Two years later, the director retired and Highet filled his place.</p>
<p>J Section. Research And Development In Advanced Nuclear Concepts. Concepts as in weapons. Advanced as in not working yet. Radiance‚Äôs charter was to develop energy weapons of all types, but Highet‚Äôs hope and pet was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project%20Excalibur" title="Wikipedia: Project Excalibur">Superbright</a>: an orbiting battle station of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative%23X-ray%20laser" title="Wikipedia: Strategic Defense Initiative#X-ray laser">hairthin rods webbed around a nuclear bomb</a>. The bomb‚Äôs ignition would charge the rods with energy, focused into beams that would flash out to strike down enemy missiles, all in the microsecond before the station consumed itself in nuclear fire.</p>
<p>So far the beams flashed out only in theory. The theory, originated by Null, seemed to Quine sound, but the more he studied his computer model, the less he understood why any of Null‚Äôs tests had ever produced the ghost of a beam. Yet the farther tests fell behind expectations, the more strident became Highet‚Äôs public claims. Warren Slater<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, in charge of testing, had resigned in protest. His letter of resignation was classified and squelched. Bernd Dietz was given interim charge of testing, and to Quine fell the task of finding in disappointing test data any optimism about the promised results.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Highet had grown ever more reckless. He began showing up at high profile conferences and seminars in subjects outside his field: on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neural%20nets" title="Wikipedia: neural nets">neural nets</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic%20programming" title="Wikipedia: genetic programming">genetic programming</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nanotechnology" title="Wikipedia: nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virtual%20reality" title="Wikipedia: virtual reality">virtual reality</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cold%20fusion" title="Wikipedia: cold fusion">cold fusion</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artificial%20life" title="Wikipedia: artificial life">artificial life</a><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, making no discriminations between the cutting edge, the speculative, and the snake oil, as if the force of his character could remake physical law, or at least the local version of it. He spoke in banquet halls at Red Lion Inns, he passed out abstracts, [pg7] offprints, videotapes, he painted futures brighter and more definite than the present, with himself and his visions at the center of them, inviting the wise and the bold to sit with him in the prosperity and rectitude of that inner circle, outside which was darkness, barbarism, and chaos.</p>
<p><em>And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy%23Alchemy%20in%20the%20Renaissance%20and%20modern%20age" title="Wikipedia: Alchemy#Alchemy in the Renaissance and modern age">many</a> have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude</em><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Again the voice. In the mind‚Äôs shadows were countless voices, dead, living, unborn, lost. Since working on Radiance Quine had dreamed them. Now they came into his waking life. This voice he recognized from Leonardo‚Äôs notebooks.</p>
<p>On his second computer, secure in steel shielding, waited Quine‚Äôs simulation of the rods. This frail superstructure of hope was raised on a sprawling foundation of faith. Hundreds of man-years of Lab effort and ingenuity had gone into the underlying physics codes [programs]. Even so, it was not possible that they could describe the full complexity of a nuclear blast. Simplifications and estimates entered in, acceptable only because their results matched experimental data to some more or less arbitrary tolerance. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation%20transport" title="Wikipedia: Radiation transport">Radiation transport</a>, magnetic fields, burn products, photon scattering, thermal conduction, ion viscosity, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bremsstrahlung" title="Wikipedia: bremsstrahlung">bremsstrahlung</a>, all these imponderables had to be calculated and updated, interacting in every kernel of space, at every nanosecond. If Quine had once puzzled for years over the paradox of a single photon, the complexities here were literally unthinkable. The reward of deep understanding was not part of the package.</p>
<p>None of this cauldron of approximation, this vast rationalization, this ingenuous mimickry, was Quine‚Äôs responsibility. To him it was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black%20box" title="Wikipedia: black box">black box</a>. His laser simulation ran on top of it all, passing it data, receiving its judgments. Again he ignited his bomb and waited for the nuclear pinball of particles and energies to reach his rods. Color bars and line graphs crept across the screen, the visible satisfactions of programming. The solipsistic machine worlds. It was near to pornography, without nuance. Any halfbright notion could be simulated, the simulation tweaked to an approximation of success, and the success conjured as proof for more funding. Tweak and squeak, as Highet put it. Realization was a ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù problem. Bend your backs, men, to prove this golden turd of an idea. [pg8]</p>
<p>The display glitched and broke into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debugger" title="Wikipedia: debugger">debugger</a>. Lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%20%28programming%20language%29" title="Wikipedia: C (programming language)">code</a> filled the screen, <code>void qelem</code>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malloc" title="Wikipedia: malloc"><code>malloc(xarray)</code></a>, <code>atof(nptr)</code>. He ceased to see words or even letters, his eyes grasping instead at the pixels, the shards of light within the characters. That radiance within the meanest mote of being.</p>
<p>What is light? Surfaces boil with quantum fire. How comes this dumb swarming to write beauty, alarm, or desolation upon the soul? Eyes are the questing front of the brain, the channel to the heart. The eye may not, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archytas" title="Wikipedia: Archytas">Archytas</a> thought, emit illuminating rays, but our knowledge of its working is no surer than his.</p>
<p>Mind‚Äôs eye and heart‚Äôs channel presented him now Kate‚Äôs russet hair, her full mouth and cheeks, her dimpled chin, her dark eyes framed by wire glasses. Like a key those features fit his heart. They appeared before him like a truth of nature. Mostly he lived in the mundane, scarcely noting what or whom he passed, but at rare moments the world came forward in all its vividness, stunning his heart. Every time he saw Kate, there was that shock of presence.</p>
<p>She was 23, he 37. They‚Äôd met in a yoga class. He hadn‚Äôt pursued at first. He was coupled with Nan, a quiet woman his own age who worked at the Lab. They lived apart but spent half their spare time together. He was content and not content with what they had. But he and Kate talked, and they went out a few times. She seemed interested in him. Her eyes met something in his. Some hope had stirred in him, some need for joy so long put by he‚Äôd ceased to miss it. Thus fed his need grew, covert but unchecked. The years separating him from Kate, years he‚Äôd squandered in ever more esoteric projects at the Lab, seemed his to reclaim at will. Kate‚Äôs attention fed in him some myth of starting over. He grew testy with Nan and impatient with himself, seeking not a break between them but between themselves and what he now acutely felt them becoming, burdens and reproofs to each other. Nan waited him out. Her deepening disappoint in him was unspoken but heavy. His desperation grew until he could contain it no longer and he lay it before Kate, blurted it out, a bitter plea. Save me. Who wouldn‚Äôt flee from that? She regarded him kindly. Oh Philip, the moment‚Äôs passed. It just didn‚Äôt happen for us. There‚Äôs someone else. That the moment could pass. That he had let it. Had not seen it passing. [pg9] Such a small thing, that attention, that renewed hope, briefly given and withdrawn, gone now.</p>
<p>The morning too was gone to no end. Every failure now he referred back to that moment, and he saw in his life only patterns of failure and emptiness.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Quine avoided that part of the building where Highet‚Äôs young theorists worked, X Section, or, as the older men called it, the Playpen. But today his customary exit was blocked by a tour group of weary adults and bored children in facepaint, their guide saying, ‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorobotics" title="Wikipedia: Nanorobotics">tiny robots</a> that actually repair human cells, as he swerved past a sign WARNING TOUR IN PROGRESS NON-CLASSIFIED CONVERSATION ONLY to the swell of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%20German%20Requiem%20%28Brahms%29" title="Wikipedia: A German Requiem (Brahms)">Brahms Requiem</a> in full clash with The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butthole%20Surfers" title="Wikipedia: Butthole Surfers">Butthole Surfers</a> and a rapid din of simulated combat followed by the admiring exclamation, ‚ÄìStudly! <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/big-win.html" title="Hacker Jargon File">Big win</a>! and laughter fading as he passed an open room in which three refrigerators stood flanked floor to ceiling by case upon case of soda, and veered into a stairwell clattering down metal steps to a metal door held open by a wastebasket and silent despite EMERGENCY EXIT ALARM WILL SOUND and emerged onto a loading dock between brown dumpsters NOT FOR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE stepping down onto a paved path then jumping back to dodge a white electric cart DAIHATSU jouncing onto a debris of torn asphalt and treadmarked dirt past chainlink CREDNE CONSTRUCTION and three blue PORT-O-LET stalls to vanish behind three glossy cylindrical tanks COMPOSIT PLASTEEL CONTAINMENT DO NOT INSTALL WITHOUT READING PLASTEEL KIT B INSTRUCTIONS, on past temporary trailers holding his mouth and nose against the metallic stench of bright green flux oozing from an open pipe into gray earth, until he regained the main road and passed the checkpoint, showing his badge, to enter Building 101, passing through the lobby where visitors and employees were edified by models of bombs, lasers, satellites, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boosters" title="Wikipedia: boosters">boosters</a>, and photos of the celebrated Nobelists who‚Äôd devised them, and on to the conference room where all but Highet had already arrived.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe was one of these, shall I say, Marxist radical types. His mother cut him out of the family money. Hello, Philip. We‚Äôre waiting for Leo [pg10] as usual. So he‚Äôs in Prague now selling laptops to the Czechs. Ah, the man himself.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho‚Äôs this you‚Äôre talking about, sounds like he‚Äôs figured out that free markets are diplomacy by other means. Everyone, this is Jef Thorpe, postdoc from the University of Utah, he‚Äôs here to look us over. Jef worked with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold%20fusion%23Fleischmann.E2.80.93Pons%20experiment" title="Wikipedia: Cold fusion#Fleischmann.E2.80.93Pons experiment">Fish and Himmelhoch on cold fusion</a>, and I just want to say don‚Äôt believe the conventional wisdom, something is happening there<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. Jef, this is Dennis Kihara, our new press officer, he takes the heat for my excesses. Bernd Dietz, materials and research. Frank Szabo, systems integration. Phil Quine, our x-ray focusing guru, Philip, Jef‚Äôs done interesting work in your area, you should sit down with him. Okay, all present? Let‚Äôs do it.</p>
<p>Highet seated the young man opposite Quine. Jeans, jacket over t-shirt, short black hair, high color, a small gold stud through his left nostril, his presence a breach of protocol and probably security, though the others knew better than to say so.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou all see the news last night? About the protest? The good news is we won. First they showed the protesters, out on the street, wind noise, bad lighting, and then our rebuttal from our respectable office. We won because we got to go last, and they put us last because we provided closure. That‚Äôs the model for our presentation: beginning, middle, end. We‚Äôll begin by showing footage of successful tests. The middle will be video simulations of the system, where we‚Äôll highlight potential problems. By defining the problems we control the questions. And we‚Äôll end by addressing the problems and introducing entirely new approaches and spin-off programs. Dennis is running things, but I may break in at any point.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, can we skip the last part, the science fiction?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, Bernd. Past, present, future. Closure. Without this you leave people ready to ask questions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre avoiding questions?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot if they‚Äôre intelligent and informed but we have a few critics and wise guys on this panel and I‚Äôd like to keep it simple.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, I have more respect than you for the intelligence of senators. Congressmen are not always so bright but</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd, it‚Äôs simple courtesy. We inform them at a level that‚Äôs neither [pg11] condescending nor technical, we tell them their money is being well spent, show them how, say thanks so much.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSalesmanship.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGrow up, Bernd, a couple times a year I ask you to do this. Is the money well spent? Yes or no.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, yes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd ah, feel better if we could discuss the middle part in ah detail, there are just some questions that I‚Äôm not comfortable to address without ah, just a little more input. For example the focusing data‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis, only Slater has questioned that data, and he‚Äôs gone. Discredited. Focus is now Philip‚Äôs baby.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo, ah, focus is our main problem?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, it‚Äôs one, said Quine. ‚ÄìFocus, brightness‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut we‚Äôre within an order of magnitude?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt see any quantitative agreement with theory, said Quine. ‚ÄìThe tests have shown a few bright spots. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm willing to commit to.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs all you‚Äôve committed to for what is it ten months now Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt see any fundamentals. I‚Äôm beginning to wonder.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you pulling a Slater on me, Philip? Because I want to tell you something, all of you. Some people in the lower echelons are making Slater out to be some kind of hero. To m this man was a menace to every one of us because he didn‚Äôt care about winning. He didn‚Äôt know what he wanted out of life and wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get it if he had known. I have no respect for parasites like that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, Null had a brilliant notion and we should pursue it, but that‚Äôs all it is so far, a notion. We</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo one‚Äôs questioned Null‚Äôs theory, no one, not even critics.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure but it‚Äôs a long way from there to even a prototype</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have supporting test data</p>
<p>‚Äìwhich may or may not mean qualitative agreement may or may not, but never quantitative, we have no understan</p>
<p>‚Äìwell you‚Äôre the one with the models Philip lo these many</p>
<p>‚Äìand you‚Äôre the one who said this was a long term project, your words, long term, and now suddenly [pg12]</p>
<p>‚Äìoh sure, and if we all had seven lives</p>
<p>‚Äìnow that there‚Äôs a little pressure it‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚Äìwhat I‚Äôm hearing</p>
<p>‚Äìit‚Äôs suddenly urgent</p>
<p>‚Äìwhat I‚Äôm hearing from you Philip is that we need more shots. Convey that necessity to our guests when they‚Äôre here, think you can do that? And put a little urgency into it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI won‚Äôt pretend we have focus when</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre not going to give me an inch are you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot on the basis of spotty data I can‚Äôt interpret.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI tell you what. There‚Äôs an eighty kiloton shot [bomb test] coming up next Saturday, right, Bernd? Piggyback it, Philip. Get yourself some better data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn what, a week? Design and fabricate apparatus in a week?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNine days. Jef can help you if he sticks around.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow hold on‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìGet off the pot. Let‚Äôs move to Frank‚Äôs contribution. You‚Äôve all read it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre moving on.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence in which papers rustled.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNothing new here, said Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs its strength. We‚Äôve taken heat on preproduction technologies. This is a simple, viable off-the-shelf option. It‚Äôs an easy sell. Contractors are lining up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs good show-and-tell, said Szabo. ‚ÄìWe can point to a card cage, this is the guidance system a year ago, then hold up a wafer, here it is today. Tangible progress.</p>
<p>Dietz continued to study the paper. ‚ÄìThese are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant%20Pebbles" title="Wikipedia: Brilliant Pebbles">Baldur</a><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-satellite%20missiles" title="Wikipedia: anti-satellite missiles">anti-satellite missiles</a> in a smaller package.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs right.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese were shelved over ten years ago as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABM%20treaty" title="Wikipedia: ABM treaty">ABM treaty</a> violation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat toilet paper? Let that worry us we might as well give up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese are not by any stretch of the imagination directed energy weapons. You want to put, what does it say, five thousand of these in orbit‚Ä¶ [pg13]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre pursuing many options, Bernd. These would be one layer of a shield. Look, it‚Äôs a long way to deployment. Oh and we get something else totally for free with Frank‚Äôs idea. Always think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual%20use" title="Wikipedia: dual use">dual use</a>. Put a warhead on these guys they‚Äôre <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic%20bombardment" title="Wikipedia: Kinetic bombardment">earth penetrators</a>, aim them downward get a thousand g impact, three k p s terminal velocity, earth-coupled shock waves to destroy hardened shelters. We have a friend in the Pentagon who‚Äôs hard for that and the Beltway boys know it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWait just wait you mean, this, these ah interceptors are for the presentation? But it‚Äôs, we need to address the existing problems, that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre coming for, we can‚Äôt feed them something totally new! And with this Slater thing</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis, trust me, it‚Äôs the best possible thing to do. As far as Slater goes, he‚Äôs history, a blip, not even an incident. This visit was scheduled long before his snit. Sure we‚Äôll get closer scrutiny than we would in the average dog-and-pony but it‚Äôs an opportunity. Remember NORAD‚Äôs famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%20American%20Aerospace%20Defense%20Command%23False%20alarms" title="Wikipedia: North American Aerospace Defense Command#False alarms">false alarms and screwups</a>? They got a billion-dollar facelift out of those incidents. You up to speed now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell yes, I mean no, not on the interceptors but‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìPut Frank‚Äôs paper in the kit, I‚Äôll step in during the presentation. Oh, and make sure everyone gets a souvenir.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA, I‚Äôm sorry?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA souvenir. What are you giving the kids for family day today?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, some laser-etched aluminum disks‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood. Run off half a dozen make it a dozen more etched with the Radiance logo, can you do that? And glossies of the new artist‚Äôs renderings.</p>
<p>Highet was out the door before anyone else had left their seat. Thorpe, abandoned, stood but did not move quickly enough to follow the older man out. As the seated men studied him incuriously he blushed and exited.</p>
<p>The others then rose. Szabo went out singing under his breath, ‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a long way, to deployment, it‚Äôs a long way, I know. In the meantime, we have employment, it‚Äôs the stick that makes us go‚Ä¶<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>At the doorway Dietz said to Quine, ‚ÄìIt is outrageous that he should bring a boy into that meeting and criticize you this way. Easy for him to make promises, but when the promises are not so easy to [pg14] deliver we suffer for them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think the boy knew what he was getting into.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTell me what you want added to this test as soon as possible. He has put our asses on the line, both of us.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll send you e-mail.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSouvenirs! He gives senators souvenirs.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Quine had come to the Lab at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%20Teller" title="Wikipedia: Edward Teller">R√©ti</a>‚Äôs invitation, R√©ti the legend, intimate of Einstein, Heisenberg, Schr√∂dinger, founder of the Lab. Impossible to refuse. R√©ti had for one semester graced Quine‚Äôs university with his presence, where he‚Äôd sat on Quine‚Äôs doctoral committee. Quine must have made an impression, for two years later R√©ti called him. I hear you are working hard on some good ideas. How would you like unlimited resources for this work?<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Come for the summer, work on what you will.</p>
<p>Quine and Sorokin, a fellow postdoc, had isolated the emission of a single photon from a calcium source in order to determine whether a lone quantum displayed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle%20duality" title="Wikipedia: Wave-particle duality">wave-particle complementarity</a>. For two long years they had refined their approach, paring it to essentials, designing an experiment they might hope to realize with the school‚Äôs meager resources. Elegance born of need. A slow and painful progress. At the Lab, in one month Quine was able to design and build a detector acute enough, and the experiment came off on the first try. Both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum%20tunnelling" title="Wikipedia: Quantum tunnelling">tunneling</a> and anticoincidence were evident. They had touched the central mystery. Even a single photon is both particle and wave.</p>
<p>Quine stayed. After that it was never a question. Not till much later did he guess that he‚Äôd been played. That R√©ti had his reason for waiting two years before approaching him. That by then his work was ripe for plucking, and the Lab‚Äôs resources had little to do with its fruition apart from giving them the juice of it.</p>
<p>At the Lab his paper brought him a celebrity near to grace. Unlimited time to think. No assigned duties. And the mysteries ceased to open to him. Idle, he took up one of Highet‚Äôs endless suggestions, the optics of x-ray mirrors. He welcomed the work, as though it paid some tithe of the mind to the practical. And it was a challenge, but finally it was, as the pioneers had with exact irony called their first bomb, a [pg15] ‚Äú<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29" title="Wikipedia: Trinity (nuclear test)">gadget</a>‚Äù. Any solution, even if it laid bare principles, was beside the point if it couldn‚Äôt kill missiles. So his mirrors never passed a design review. He wrote some computer codes for modeling the mirrors, and those turned out to have some peripheral application in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inertial%20confinement%20fusion" title="Wikipedia: inertial confinement fusion">inertial confinement fusion</a>. The weapons work which he knew to be central to the Lab still seemed distant from him. Then Radiance geared up, and his modeling software proved flexible enough to accommodate the next idea: the bombpumped Superbright. Opportunistic as a virus, the Lab took it up. Now he was pressured. Now he was in a competitive atmosphere where the possibility of failure, of weakness, of doubt, could not be voiced even to oneself lest it undermine the resolve needed to get through each day. All the projects here were difficult, at the edge of the possible, and all the scientists worked at their limits and at the limits of their science. You could work on a problem for months only to have your work demolished in minutes in a review by your peers, your competitors, your colleagues. That was what reviews were for: to show up fatal flaws before they became expensively entrenched in a design. So ideas were hammered without mercy. It was and it wasn‚Äôt personal. If the idea was good, it was yours but somehow beyond you, and if it was bad the attack was on it, not on you. Quine saw men in tears even as they went on arguing and, after it was over, thank their assailants<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Throughout this he kept silent faith with the mysteries. He would return to them when the pressures of the moment were past. Programming took only the surface of his mind; its essence he held in reserve, or so he thought. Quine came at last to understand that he did well at his assigned tasks precisely because he brought them his all. Nothing was left over.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When he left the building the sun was low. The air was thick with heat, and as he started the car the radio blurted ‚Äìrecord temp, before he silenced it.</p>
<p>Through the gate traffic slowed. Demonstrators in costume paraded in the road. Quine edged forward through skeletons and spooks with signs and props, TECHNOLOGIES OF DEATH, a longrobed mantisheaded figure towering on stilts above the crowd, tambourines jangling, EL D√çA DE LOS MUERTOS, and lab security herding the [pg16] crowd off the road. As he cleared the crowd a klaxon blared. The mantis swayed, tugging at robes snagged on the perimeter razorwire as the entrance gates slid shut, alarm lights strobing. On the inner perimeter road security vehicles appeared, racing toward the entry kiosk. Then he saw standing by his passenger window the woman who resembled Kate. She wore black spandex bicycle pants and a blue <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambric" title="Wikipedia: Cambric">chambray</a> shirt. She was staring at the gate. Quine hesitated, then rolled down the window.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou want a ride out of here? They‚Äôre going to start arresting people.</p>
<p>She looked at him, then back at the gate. On the main road Quine saw a flurry of approaching lights. City police.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt wait.</p>
<p>Whoops blasts squeals cut the crowd noise. She saw the vehicles approaching and with something like annoyance got into Quine‚Äôs car. Quine sped away shutting his window against the shriek of the passing vehicles.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm Philip Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn Hamlin. Did you see what happened?</p>
<p>When he looked at her all resemblance fell away. Same body type, same round features, but hair almost black with a russet tinge, cropped close to the neck. No glasses. Dark penetrating eyes. Tanned calves faintly downed, lithe as a huntress‚Äôs. No key turned in his heart, just an echo of loss.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe one on stilts, his costume caught on the fence. It must have set off the alarm.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWere you there for the demo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo. I work there.</p>
<p>His ID was still clipped to his jacket. She‚Äôd been looking at it, and now she smiled, as if to confide her little subterfuge.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you work on?</p>
<p>He turned onto a road parallel to the freeway, where earthmovers were parked in torn up lots behind emporia of sporting goods, fast food, auto parts, videotapes, computers, discount carpets. Sun flashed through the struts of a half finished retaining wall.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDefense weapons. [pg17]</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean Radiance. Do you believe in it?</p>
<p><em>And those in the anterooms of Hell demur, saying, I do not approve what goes on inside.</em></p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs what I do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know what Einstein said? That you can‚Äôt simultaneously prepare for war and prevent it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere can I drop you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìCorner of Mariposa.</p>
<p>As they passed over the freeway, the sun struck their shadow out toward the golden eastern hills. He sensed her still looking at him, then she faced ahead.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI like this time of day, she said. ‚ÄìThe light.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt, said Quine. ‚ÄìIt makes me think of endings.</p>
<p>She said nothing to that. As the car descended into the shadow of the overpass Quine said, ‚ÄìWe didn‚Äôt hear about the protest. The organizers usually let us know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe they‚Äôre tired of playing your game.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not my game. A green sign with white letters Mariposa hung over the intersection. Quine pulled to the curb by a bus stop bench placarded FAST DIVORCE BANKRUPTCY. She turned to him with sudden vehemence.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese demonstrations won‚Äôt stop, you know. You don‚Äôt know how angry people are‚Ä¶ Her voice held some doubt, whether for the anger or his belief in it, he couldn‚Äôt tell.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen I‚Äôll probably see you again out there, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTell me, what‚Äôs the point, I mean, isn‚Äôt it obviously a waste now that the cold war</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, and hearing the annoyance in his voice he stanched it, ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt make policy‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, that‚Äôs part of the problem, isn‚Äôt it. People not taking responsibility for what they do.</p>
<p>Pricked, he turned to her just as a bus pulled to the curb, the squeal of its brakes preempting whatever he might have meant to say. Some hurt might have remained in his eyes. She seemed abashed and held his gaze for a moment longer before reaching to unbuckle her seatbelt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen‚Ä¶ would you have lunch with me sometime? [pg18]</p>
<p>She looked at him in surprise. ‚ÄìLunch? Why?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd just like to talk more.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo we have anything to say to each other?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe could find out. His pulse thickened in his throat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you‚Äôre the enemy, she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMe‚Ä¶? He caught, under her serious dark brow, a glimpse of mischief, though she didn‚Äôt smile.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks for the ride.</p>
<p>She was out the door before he felt the protest of his heart. So even now he had not relinquished hope.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When he got home Nan‚Äôs car was in his parking space. Most Tuesday nights she spent with Quine. He went to her place Friday nights and some weekends. But he‚Äôd worked late Tuesday, so they‚Äôd shifted it to tonight. He‚Äôd forgotten.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLo, she called, ‚ÄìIn the kitchen. I picked up some tortellini at Il Fornaio and a salad, is that okay?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine. As he entered she turned with a wary smile. The sight of her brought him a roil of giddiness, of memory, of guilt, of sadness. Her features were sharp and fine, her skin pale, her straight auburn hair just starting to show gray, her slight body always dressed with a style that in its impeccability read as a brave front.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBread‚Äôs in the oven, can you get that?</p>
<p>He looked for an oven mitt while she talked about her day, some seniority conflict in the personnel department. Quine‚Äôs patience wore. When, setting the plates down, she bent to kiss his neck, he flinched.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs wrong?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNothing. It‚Äôs just Highet‚Äôs going mad again. A Congressional visit‚Äôs coming up, it should be routine, but he acts like the whole program‚Äôs at stake.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFirst he drops Null‚Äôs work in my lap, then today he starts pimping some lunatic idea of Szabo‚Äôs, and he assigns me a postdoc like, like a chaperone‚Ä¶ and the protesters.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about them?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre getting on my nerves. [pg19]</p>
<p>They ate in silence for a few minutes. At last he said, ‚ÄìWhat would you think if I quit?</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuit? Your job?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut Philip, what would you do?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I don‚Äôt know. I could take some time off to think about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTime off? I thought that we were trying to save money‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìSave‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, I‚Äôm not trying to pressure you, but I thought we agreed that it makes sense to look for a place together‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI told you, Nan, I can‚Äôt think about that while this project is on, I can‚Äôt make big plans like that until this whole thing is, is settled.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, couldn‚Äôt we start looking just to see what‚Äôs available, just go to a few open houses‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf you want. But I don‚Äôt see the point if we can‚Äôt afford it yet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe point is to plan for a future, Philip. Haven‚Äôt you made any progress?</p>
<p>‚ÄìProgress, I feel like I‚Äôm chasing my tail, there‚Äôs no progress to be made!</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease don‚Äôt snap at me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI, I can‚Äôt even discuss it with you, you don‚Äôt have the clearance.</p>
<p>She stood and carried dishes into the kitchen. He got up to follow.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNan‚Ä¶ He came up behind her and embraced her. Her hands rested on his forearms.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about Sunday?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSunday?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre seeing Ginny and Bill, remember? If you came early we could</p>
<p>‚ÄìSunday. Look, I have a deadline. I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sorry but I just can‚Äôt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre working? But if you‚Äôre not getting anywhere‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell but that‚Äôs the whole problem isn‚Äôt it! Meantime there are still short-term goals and meetings.</p>
<p>She sighed and left the kitchen. In the living room the television came on. When after a moment he entered the room he heard her in the bedroom speaking on the telephone. Remote control in hand he viewed a cool panoptic tumble of war famine catastrophe enormity [pg20] larded with a fantastic plenty of goods caressed by smiling tanned models, to pause on the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/logotype" title="A symbol or emblem that acts as a trademark or a means of identification of an institution or other entity, usually referred to as a logo.">logotype</a> of Martin Marietta, ‚Äìa proud supporter for twenty-five years of science programming on public television, his impulse to switch again frozen by the worn, imposing face of Aron R√©ti, saying thickly, ‚ÄìIn science there is a cult of the beautiful theory. But how beautiful is reality? These beautiful theories, these elegant mathematics are not verified by experiment. Experiment shows us a mess of a universe with over a hundred basic particles and three irreconcilable forces. We would like to unify them all, just as we would like to smooth over all the political differences in the world. But experience shows, in physics and in politics, that this is not always possible.</p>
<p>Abruptly the screen glared with the involute radiance of the bomb. Sun‚Äôs heart. Cosmic ground. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva" title="Wikipedia: Shiva">Siva</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi" title="Wikipedia: Devi">Devi</a> coupling. A thin roar issued from the set and the thick voice rode over it, ‚ÄìThe duty of science is to pursue knowledge even if it leads to the unbeautiful. Or to evil. How else learn about evil?</p>
<p>Nan returned to sit beside him. ‚ÄìIsn‚Äôt that R√©ti?</p>
<p>The camera returned to the physicist. Emeritus director, R√©ti was rarely at the Lab; the office he kept there served him solely as a clubroom or a backdrop. Six months ago a film crew had come to the Lab. Quine had heard R√©ti shouting at them behind the closed door.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWatch, this is what Highet calls the liberal bias of the media, said Quine as the camera went to the interviewer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAfter the war, many of your colleagues turned away from weapons. Some of them have won Nobel Prizes. Do you feel that your work with weapons has cost you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%20Teller%23Oppenheimer%20controversy" title="Wikipedia: Edward Teller#Oppenheimer controversy">credibility or respect within the scientific community</a>? Has it compromised you as a scientist?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNever. In fact it has challenged and improved me as a scientist.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre closely connected to Radiance. What about recent charges that test results have been faked?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is a lie! First, I am not closely connected‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you‚Äôve lobbied extensively for Radiance in Wash</p>
<p>‚ÄìI am no lobbyist! I am a private citizen with some scientific expertise, and when I am asked to testify about technical matters I do so‚Ä¶ [pg21]</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut for over forty years you‚Äôve been an advocate of nuclear weapons. Your authority and influence are well known.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow you listen to me. It is an imperfect world, a dangerous world. There is evil in the world. How do you meet it? All ends, even the best, are reached by impure means. Reason is supposed to be the hallmark of science, but I tell you that no one is swayed by reason. A theory, an idea, does not make its own way. It was Einstein who said merit alone is very little good; it must be backed by tact and knowledge of the world. I know of many cases where maybe the data does not quite agree with your theory, no, you think, the carpers will question, your case is far clearer if you discard this set of data, if you report only these results. And who are these frauds? Ptolemy<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>. Galileo<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>. Newton<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli%23Early_life" title="Wikipedia: Daniel_Bernoulli#Early_life">Bernoulli</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor%20Mendel%23Controversy" title="Wikipedia: Gregor Mendel#Controversy">Mendel</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Andrews_Millikan%23Data_selection_controversy" title="Wikipedia: Robert_Andrews_Millikan#Data_selection_controversy">Millikan</a>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> What matters in the long run is not some wishful dream of scruples, but whether you have driven your knowledge home!</p>
<p>Behind the fury in R√©ti‚Äôs eyes Quine saw a bright and open wound: more illustrious for his influence than his work, he had failed at everything but success. And Quine‚Äôs own life, he suddenly saw, was bent around R√©ti‚Äôs influence. A man has no wealth nor power but his knowledge, R√©ti had once said to Quine. But now he said that if power did not lead, knowledge could not follow. Quine stood, ignoring ‚ÄìPhilip? what is it? and went to the bathroom. He held the sides of the sink, heart racing. In the cabinet he found the pill bottle.</p>
<p><em>The spirit is radiant, yet there are two principles of radiance: that of light, and that of fire. Fire comes to the use of those who go not the way of light. And the difference is, that fire must consume its object.</em><a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Quine returned to R√©ti‚Äôs angry voice, ‚ÄìSo I have no Nobel Prize, that accolade of the pure. But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred%20Nobel%23Inventions" title="Wikipedia: Alfred Nobel#Inventions">Alfred Nobel</a> would understand me well. And history will be my judge, not you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is it, Philip? What‚Äôs the matter?</p>
<p>Quine turned to Nan, her face in the phosphor light bleak as a rock outcrop. He reached to touch her neck. Unsmiling she leaned her head against his hand. His fingers cupped her nape and he drew her mouth to his.</p>
<p>In the bedroom they undressed on opposite sides of the bed. The television droned on. Between her legs he felt the string of a tampon, [pg22] and as he touched it she bent double and enclosed him in her mouth. Above the activity of their bodies his spirit hovered sadly regarding the terrain of his life. Lightly his hands cradled her head. He began to pump semen. Deep inside him a talon drove home and brought forth, impaled, his soul, writhing. A minute later he was awash in sleep. Waiting at a counter to pick up xeroxes. Quick tap at his shoulder. Kate. She smiled, her eyes upon him, and he knew it was a dream, and he was happy, and he slept. [pg23]</p>
<section id="two" class="level3">
<h3>Two</h3>
<p>The morning sky, pallid with haze, conveyed yet enough sun to cast through the high embrasure of his office window a faint rhombus which crept toward the doorway relentless as a horologue. From his desk Quine gazed at it half hearing the radio, ‚Äìildfires in three counties, when his phone rang.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs this Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, who‚Äôs this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn. From the demo yesterday?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh. Oh yes. How did you‚Ä¶ He stood and paced with the phone. ‚ÄìHow did you get my number?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI called the switchboard. I want to apologize. I behaved badly. Are you free for coffee?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I‚Ä¶ not this morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLater this afternoon?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt let me pressure you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo I, I want to. It‚Äôs just a surprise.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI get off work at four. Do you know the Caf√© Desaparecidos [the missing]? In the central mall. I work near there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure I, okay, I‚Äôll see you there about four.</p>
<p>As he hung up Jef Thorpe knocked on his open door. Black jacket, blue shirt, jeans. A faint pock where yesterday the nose stud had been.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome in. [pg24]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI guess we‚Äôll be working together.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, you‚Äôre staying.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf you‚Äôll have me. Listen, that meeting yesterday, I didn‚Äôt belong there, I‚Äôm sorry if‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot your fault. Doctor Highet has his way of doing things.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, I see that. Listen, before we started I want to tell you, the single-photon experiment you did with Sorokin was really elegant. I was, you know, sort of surprised to find you here, I thought you‚Äôd be somewhere more theoretical.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought everyone had forgotten that experiment by now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh no. It was very sweet work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe detector was critical. We worked on it for two years. We got it only after I came here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou didn‚Äôt follow it up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorokin thought I was wrong to come here. He said it would be a black hole. He may have been right. Of course things look different from inside.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBlack hole, yeah, I‚Äôve thought of that. But you know where I come from. That limits my options in the straight academic world.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt have qualms about defense work?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm here for.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs just, you might want to consider your position. I came in neutral about defense work, but before long I was in the thick of it. It‚Äôs easy to slip into.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sort of apolitical.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, if that‚Äôs what you want, turning to the computer which glowed with:</p>

<p>‚ÄúMechanics are the Paradise of mathematical science, because here we [pg25] come to the fruits of mathematics.‚Äù LdV<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚ÄìLooks like we‚Äôre real, said Thorpe.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre lucky. It was years before I was associated with a shot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that luck?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a bit of a prestige. A merit badge<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Quine cleared the screen and brought up the Superbright test data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou see. Intense brightness here, and here. Very erratic pattern.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis data is picked up how?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen the bomb ignites, radiation from the rods bounces off some reflectors to</p>
<p>‚ÄìX-ray mirrors?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, something like that. They‚Äôre <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beryllium" title="Wikipedia: beryllium">beryllium</a>. The data agrees with theory to a point, but when we increase power, we don‚Äôt get an increase in beam, in fact we get less. We‚Äôve talked about trying different metals in the rods, we‚Äôve used gold till now, but mercury‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, elements seventy-two through ninety-five would be good to try but with the, you know, time constraints, I checked and Fabrication has gold rods ready to go, so maybe those are a good choice and you can, or I mean we can sort of concentrate on sensor configuration‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìSounds reasonable.</p>
<p>Thorpe continued to stare at the screen. ‚ÄìCould this be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus%20%28mathematics%29" title="Wikipedia: Annulus (mathematics)">annular</a>? This pattern I mean, could those reflectors be picking up a sort of imperfect focus, you know, the edge of a ring? If we move them in‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve tried, no luck.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I look at your focusing code?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, sure, all the files are in this directory.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs great. Mind if I work here? pointing to Null‚Äôs desk.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, sure. Sure, go ahead. I‚Äôm going for lunch and maybe a swim.<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> I‚Äôll see you later.</p>
<p><em>We read of the beaver that when it is pursued, knowing that it is for the medicinal virtue of its testicles and not being able to escape, it stops; and it bites off its testicles with its sharp teeth and leaves them to its enemies.</em><a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>Gaunt, saturnine, Bran Nolan in a corner of the cafeteria looked up unsmiling from scattered papers to raise a hand in greeting. [pg26]</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow‚Äôs our new boyo Kihara?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWeren‚Äôt you in line for that position?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs my Tourette‚Äôs syndrome. Terrible liability in a press officer, never know what he might blurt out in public.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou should have been asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know, I‚Äôm happier, if that‚Äôs the word I want, where I am. Kihara is a little lamb. The last man, Vessell, didn‚Äôt outlast Slater. And we‚Äôre not done with all that, no indeed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGetting some work done? Quine indicated the papers.</p>
<p>‚Äì‚ÄúThe Lab has a longstanding commitment to developing new methods and technologies to protect the environment‚Äù, the most effective of which to date has been the press release. Do you know we have a toxics mitigation program now? Seems there‚Äôs a toxic plume seeping into the groundwater under a vineyard off the north boundary. Vines died, soil went gray, the whole field stinks like sepsis. I‚Äôm writing an upbeat report about it. And yourself? How‚Äôs the death ray coming?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can maim small insects at a meter. The new concept is interceptors. Small flying rocks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know, da Vinci invented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel%20shell" title="Wikipedia: Shrapnel shell">shrapnel</a><a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>. He‚Äôd have been right at home here with all these advanced minds.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs Highet‚Äôs conceit.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThrowing rocks at things. We should be proud, thinking about these old impulses in such an advanced way.</p>
<p>A plump figure came forward shaking a sheaf of papers, from which Nolan recoiled. ‚ÄìBran, Bran, Bran. What must I do to get you to use a font other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier%20%28typeface%29" title="Wikipedia: Courier (typeface)">Courier</a>?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHello Bob, how‚Äôs the gout? I don‚Äôt like this business of tarting up manuscripts. You get enchanted by the beauty of it all. You start to think you‚Äôre writing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book%20of%20Kells" title="Wikipedia: Book of Kells">Book of Kells</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA few attractive fonts, tastefully applied, can spice up a presentation. A little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humanitas" title="Wikipedia: humanitas">humanitas</a>, you know. Why else, Bran, did we get you that powerful and costly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/workstation" title="Wikipedia: workstation">workstation</a>?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know, Bob, why did you? I was still figuring out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM%20Selectric%20typewriter" title="Wikipedia: IBM Selectric typewriter">type balls on my Selectric</a>.</p>
<p>The sheaf of papers fell fanning from their clip onto the table. [pg27]</p>
<p>Shaking his head and chuckling grimly, Bob passed on to another table.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHumanitas, yes, that‚Äôs what we need here, isn‚Äôt it, Highet with his Renaissance, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus%20Manutius" title="Wikipedia: Aldus Manutius">Aldus Manutius</a> there, need a few more particle men who‚Äôve read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao%20Te%20Ching" title="Wikipedia: Tao Te Ching">Tao Te Ching</a><a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>, couple more managers who‚Äôve studied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun%20Tzu" title="Wikipedia: Sun Tzu">Sun Tzu</a>, lend these binary views a little tone, dress up the winners and losers, the Elect and the Preterite<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>, the screwers and the screwed. Each man in his station, and keep your distance from the low life, can‚Äôt have just anyone winning, because if you ever let the rabble ahead, if they can rise, you can surely fall.</p>
<p>Nolan folded back pages, ‚Äìlisten to this bit, ‚Äúthe support of this tight-knit community‚Äù, support is it now? I‚Äôd have said the goading, the ambition, the Schadenfreude, that‚Äôs what gets the work done. The wife walked out six months ago with the kid, you‚Äôre eating Campbell‚Äôs soup cold out of the can, you haven‚Äôt got a clean shirt, but after a few months of eighteen hour days you‚Äôve got <em>data</em> that everyone wants to see. You <em>win big</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBran, you work here, too.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat should I do then, write novels? Or maybe journalism, that‚Äôs it, <em>investigative</em> journalism. Have you met the journalist from Cambridge? Right over there with his tape recorder, name‚Äôs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh%20Gusterson" title="Wikipedia: Hugh Gusterson">Armand Steradian</a>. He‚Äôs researching the belief systems of those who work on weapons of mass destruction<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>, I think that was his phrase. Quite the charmer. He‚Äôs published one book on scientific fraud, and a paper highly critical of what he calls the defense establishment. You probably don‚Äôt watch TV but there was a program on PBS last night, Steradian was in it abusing R√©ti.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoes Highet know he‚Äôs here?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet invited him.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Quine headed for the door, passing as he did Armand Steradian, who held a small microphone before a J Section technician, ‚Äìyou‚Äôre so goldang busy every day you just put off thinking about it, though in Quine‚Äôs view pressure was a tool well used to put off thinking.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Black cottonwoods around the pool throve despite the drought. Their catkins littered the water. A jet moved on the sky, stitching a contrail [pg28] across a lace of cloud where a white sun struggled. Quine sat on a towel on the grassy verge and watched a portly swimsuited man enter through the gate, barrel chest glossed with hair, and behind him a woman in a white halter top and shorts, the heads of three men turning to follow. The pool was crowded this Friday afternoon; it was warm, it was the end of the workweek, it was family day; unlike Quine, most worked a five day week, most would depart hence into a forgetfulness. In the shallows of the pool two young girls splashed. One opened her mouth to show her companion a bright penny on her outstretched tongue. A young mother in a black maillot gripped a ladder to raise herself half from the pool and wave at her infant in a nearby stroller, glisten and shadow in the cords of her back, and Quine suffered a pang for a life now beyond his knowing: to be wed, with child, so young. On thermals a black and white winged vulture, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathartes%20aura" title="Wikipedia: Cathartes aura">Cathartes aura</a></em>, rocked and banked. From the jet thunder fell like muffled blows. The warmth and the sound of water churned by swimmers and the spray tossed up by their passing lulled Quine into a lethargy from which he woke with a start to consult his watch. On the pool‚Äôs floor danced cusps of light.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The caf√©‚Äôs walls rose past exposed beams and ducts to the nacre of frosted skylights. Lynn sat in a wirebacked chair at a glass table, face downcast at papers before her. In the moment before she looked up, Kate‚Äôs face glowed before him. What do you do, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHoy es el <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%C3%ADa%20de%20los%20muertos" title="Wikipedia: d√≠a de los muertos">d√≠a de los muertos</a>, Lynn said in greeting, banishing Kate‚Äôs image. Angularities all her own moved in her flesh; a small gap showed between her teeth as she smiled.</p>
<p>Quine seated himself and said gravely, ‚ÄìI should tell you I‚Äôm involved with someone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGee, I said I wanted to apologize, not start an affair.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI, sorry I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd maybe pick your brain about Radiance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry, I, what did you say before? El d√≠a‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìToday is the Day of the Dead. All Saint‚Äôs Day. All of California used to be Mexico, you know, they called it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztl%C3%A1n%23Use%20by%20the%20Chicano%20movement" title="Wikipedia: Aztl√°n#Use by the Chicano movement">Aztlan</a>. Once my group shuts the Lab down, we‚Äôre going to reclaim Aztlan for the native peoples [pg29]. Oh, don‚Äôt look that way, I‚Äôm joking, that‚Äôs the kind of thing the far right says about us.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour group?</p>
<p>‚ÄìCitizens Against Nuclear Technology<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>. I‚Äôm a paralegal with them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs that you‚Äôre reading?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour press releases. She held a sheaf set in unadorned Courier font. ‚ÄìYou people have fingers in a lot of pies. When I started my concern was the bombs, but that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg, isn‚Äôt it. There‚Äôs also the supercomputers, the lasers, the genetics, the chemicals‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou probably know more about it than I do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour cover stories are so creative. Every one of. Oh, go ahead, order, she‚Äôs waiting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCappuccino. What do you mean, cover stories?</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuisiera un espresso por favor. Every one of these quote benign technologies has a pretty easy to imagine military use. Laser <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x-ray%20lithography" title="Wikipedia: x-ray lithography">x-ray lithography</a> for etching microchips, uh huh, right, and here‚Äôs one about kinder gentler <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical%20warfare" title="Wikipedia: Chemical warfare">C</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological%20warfare" title="Wikipedia: Biological warfare">B</a>W, ‚Äúless virulent‚Äù tear gas for ‚Äúcrowd control‚Äù, heavier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/specific%20gravity" title="Wikipedia: specific gravity">specific gravity</a> for controlled delivery, if this is the stuff you‚Äôre public about I can only imagine the rest.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre wrong, there‚Äôs a genuine effort to convert to peacef</p>
<p>‚ÄìDual use, I know. Genuine effort to blur the line is what it is, and it goes far beyond the Lab, people in physics and comp sci departments across the country are lining up at the same trough, the grants are there and if they don‚Äôt take the money someone else will. That‚Äôs the reasoning. What a waste of talent and resources.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs more complicated than that. The people I work with, they‚Äôre not cynical.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I know how people get caught up in their work. I have a friend there, not in Radiance, in another section. He‚Äôs a Quaker, he calls it ‚Äúbeing in the world‚Äù. At least he‚Äôs thought about it. How did you get into it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMe? I‚Äôm, well, a lapsed theorist. But I‚Äôm not typical‚Ä¶ Was he not? R√©ti, Highet, Dietz, Thorpe, all had failed in some subtle way that in such a place could be denied. But where was there not failure and denial?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo your people pay any attention at all to our demonstrations? [pg30]</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn J Section? Not much.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe seem to bug your boss, at least.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn his little red sports car. What about you? What did you think about the big one yesterday?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt seemed, I don‚Äôt know, festive, almost a costume party, I didn‚Äôt realize at first it was Halloween‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut no, that wasn‚Äôt it. It was a ceremony. An exorcism.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh come on, what, you mean we‚Äôre possessed‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBy arrogance, if nothing else.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs absurd, you can‚Äôt convince anyone with some absurd ritual‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs no different from your rituals, your bomb tests, just as absurd, but really dangerous!</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre not my tests‚Ä¶ and he remembered <em>B. Dietz &amp; P. Quine, sup.</em> ‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm no good at talking about this.</p>
<p>The set of her features, so poised and eager, softened then and her voice lowered. ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt mean to attack you. I‚Äôm sure you think about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but, but I‚Äôm not sure! What to do, I mean. What if it is a waste, what if, if all the money and the decades, all the lives and talent‚Ä¶ then it‚Äôs more than just me, it‚Äôs not just my mistake, but something wrong at the root of it, and what, what can I do about that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf it is a mistake, you can face it. You could stop.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut that wouldn‚Äôt stop anything. It‚Äôs almost as if these things we work on‚Ä¶ they use us to get born. Could use anyone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt must be very hard for you. Their eyes met, and the troubled sympathy in hers wrung him. Her face was so concerned for him that he almost cried out with selfpity.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not your fault. I, I need to get back now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI really am sorry, can we‚Ä¶ can we forget about all this and just start over?</p>
<p>‚ÄìStart over‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>Abruptly he rose and walked away stolid with loathing of his own erratic heart, and of her for stirring it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[pg31] In the night he woke sweating with a pulse of ninety, reached for the pillbottle next to the small box <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_LaBerge%23Lucid%20dreaming%20education%20and%20facilitation" title="Wikipedia: Stephen_LaBerge#Lucid dreaming education and facilitation">DREAMLIGHT</a> Unlock Your Inner Potential and its plastic headset. The pills opened a plain of timelessness in which it seemed a lost part of himself dwelled. as he lay in their haze, his fluency returned. Wonderful problems enticed and yielded to his insight, wisdom depended from the sky like fruit. He kept a notebook in case any insight survived his waking. None did.</p>
<p>He attached the headset like a blindfold. At the onset of dreaming a strobe would flicker there and rouse him enough to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid%20dream" title="Wikipedia: Lucid dream">observe and direct his dream but not to wake</a>. He settled and conjured an image: the battle station shining in the void of space. Slender arms and rods pivoting. The missile rise in swarms, bright points on the black hollow of a crescent Earth. They blur in a silver mist of chaff. Above the crescent distant battle stations ignite in globes of light, their beams lance out, but swarm follows swarm up from the Earth, far too many to destroy. He pulled off the headset.</p>
<p>The world has changed, the old enemy has collapsed into ruined republics. Yet despite this consummation of all the Lab has strived for, the work goes on, the mood is spiritless, the shots in the desert continue like some ritual of penance, some black and endless propitiation of forces that in losing their fixed abode have grown closer and more menacing.</p>
<p>Stillness. Faint whistle of tinnitus, first sounds of birdcall. Wan dawn light. The enemy is gone. But the work goes on and on.<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<section id="three" class="level3">
<h3>Three</h3>
<p>[pg32] For a while Lynn was not among the protesters. Their numbers had diminished to a small contingent by the main gate, holding a drooping sheet painted DIABOLIS EX MACHINA. Quine slowed through the gate and stopped, valves in the engine ticking, for a backhoe lurching across the main road, and closed his window against the dust billowing toward him as he went on past an air hammer breaking a sidewalk to rubble, overtones of its chatter following him across the rock moat and into the building where, too late to retreat, he saw Thorpe seated at Null‚Äôs computer tapping without letup at Quine‚Äôs entrance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMorning, said Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs it? I‚Äôve been here all night. Something there for you to read.</p>
<p>On top of Quine‚Äôs stack of journals, a year‚Äôs unread accumulation, colored slips in their pages flagging articles that at an earlier time would not have waited a day, was a xerox topped with a yellow sticker SEEN THIS? <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical%20Review%20Letters" title="Wikipedia: Physical Review Letters">Physical Review Letters</a> 1954</em>. A dig at his age?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know it‚Äôs old, said Thorpe. ‚ÄìBut I think it applies. See, I started with an EE from a hick school, taught myself quantum mechanics by reading Dirac, so my perspective is sort of, things don‚Äôt change that much. Lots of good ideas have been left hanging. That‚Äôs how I found your paper‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ stumbling at having touched as he thought Quine‚Äôs sensitive point, ‚Äìnot to say, it‚Äôs just, you know, if you‚Äôre a student like me, not well connected, not seeing all the latest preprints and hearing all the gossip, you need another way up. So this is my way, sort of looking for old forgotten stuff to build on. [pg3]</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo tell me about this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI came across it working for Fish and Himmelhoch, looking for a sort of nuclear model to explain the cold fusion reaction? Okay I know, the current wisdom is, there‚Äôs no reaction, it‚Äôs bogus, or if anything is happening it‚Äôs electrochemical, okay, fine. But you know, if you model the process in a nuclear way, it looks like a phenomenon called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/super-radiance" title="Wikipedia: super-radiance">super-radiance</a>. The equations are similar. Highet saw the connection.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTo this? Highet told you about Superbright?</p>
<p>‚ÄìVery sharp guy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs quite a breach of classification.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe sort of hinted around it, citing the open literature. Anyway it‚Äôs moot, I‚Äôm cleared now. What do you think?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll read it when I get a chance, dropping it back on to the stack of journals.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, I mean, we don‚Äôt have much time. Should I pursue it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat have you been doing?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, here, let me show you, I started sort of modifying your code but I had a couple of quest</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou changed my files?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no I made copies, changes only on my copies and I</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, but look, just be sure you log all your changes into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided%20software%20engineering" title="Wikipedia: Computer-aided software engineering">CASE system</a>, okay? You know how that works?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, sure but I wondered about a few things like where you‚Äôve got this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array%20data%20structure" title="Wikipedia: Array data structure">array</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating%20point" title="Wikipedia: Floating point">reals</a> here, what‚Äôs that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the rod array, angles lengths diameters densities</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay I thought so, because see I was thinking if you make that something like ten to the minus ten here</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the thickness, we can‚Äôt make rods that thin it‚Äôs imposs</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut what if we play what-if with these numbers‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWait what are you do</p>
<p>‚Äìthen the beam, oops that‚Äôs a little extreme but you see what I</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut there‚Äôs no, I mean sure, you can make the model do anything, but it has to correspond to reality!</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure, I‚Äôm just getting, you know, the feel of the system. But, oh here I wanted to know what this function does, this hyperbol</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes that‚Äôs the response curve of the reflec, look, can this wait? [pg34] and without pausing Quine was out of the office as from speakers overhead a pleasant female voice advised, ‚ÄìAttention all personnel. Starting at midnight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiger%20teams" title="Wikipedia: tiger teams">tiger teams</a> will conduct exercises in this area using blank ammunition‚Ä¶ and he turned into the restroom where at the end, past a row of sinks and urinals opposite metal stalls, a gym bag hung on a hook and steam billowed as Quine, elbows braced on a basin, looked up from the laving of his hands at a bass voice echoing around the hard tile, ‚Äìbist du ein Tor und rein, to see in the mirror not his own eternally surprised features but fogged void, and turned from the hiss of his faucet to glimpse through the mist a hard white nude male body emerging to towel itself, still singing, ‚Äìwelch Wissen dir auch mag beschieden sein<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the cavernous building where Dietz supervised, Quine watched long metal tubes welded one by one to the great monstrance in which the bomb would rest a quarter mile underground. From instruments at the ends of each tube hundreds of cables would run to the surface. Dietz displayed a blueprint of the cylinder.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe are already welding. I cannot wait to know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan you hold off a day or two? If I had any idea where to put the damn things I‚Äôd tell you if I had any idea even how to find what I‚Äôm looking for‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can go ahead with other things for just a little while. For a day. Now the rod configuration‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìUnchanged. I‚Äôm not touching that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMake sure, please, that Highet knows all this. Sometimes he wanders through here and if things are not what he expects he is most unpleasant.</p>
<p>Outside Highet‚Äôs office Quine, arm raised to knock, from within heard Highet‚Äôs insistent rasp, ‚Äìlike <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%20Kammerer" title="Wikipedia: Paul Kammerer">Kammerer</a>, you know, it‚Äôs not who makes the mistake it‚Äôs who takes the blame, and at Thorpe‚Äôs voice barely audible, ‚Äìsorry for the poor son of a bitch stuck in his position at his age, barely shows his face, and Highet, ‚Äìnever passed a design review, Quine‚Äôs ears flared with heat, the door before him turning flat and insubstantial as he lowered his hand and proceeded down the hall unseeing, guided by a familiarity more the prisoner‚Äôs than the adept‚Äôs [pg35] around a corner to a water fountain, stopped before a bulletin board and its overlapping notices O Section, programmer needed to model underground plumes K Section, LASS expert needed Z Section, multimedia guru sought B Section, materials engineer, while two young men passed, one saying, ‚ÄìI have no special loyalty to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented%20programming" title="Wikipedia: Object-oriented programming">OOP</a>, and on to a further junction where a convex mirror above him presented an anamorphic view around the corner. There Nan emerged from a cross corridor with a wiry man, white teeth in a tanned face, blackhaired forearms folded. The two spoke briefly. The man put a hand on Nan‚Äôs neck and bent forward to kiss her mouth. Quine turned back the way he had come, slowing only when he found he had nearly circled the building. He backtracked to Highet‚Äôs door and entered without knocking.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGet Thorpe out of my office.</p>
<p>Highet looked up in surprise. ‚ÄìWhat did he do to you, Philip? You look ready to spit.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf he‚Äôs so important give him his own space, I don‚Äôt want him hanging around me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThought you‚Äôd appreciate the company, thought he might be useful to you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThorpe handles himself well, you could learn from him. Show some team spirit. Poor boy‚Äôs feeling abandoned by you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll work with him, but I don‚Äôt have to like him or share office space with him. It‚Äôs bad enough Null‚Äôs stuff is still there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThorpe has his own space. You want him out, you can tell him so. By the way, R√©ti‚Äôs here for a visit, you might want to pay your respects. Instead of running around down in Fabrication with Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSomeone has to tend to those details.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet me tell you something, Philip, I‚Äôm a smart guy but to be brutally honest I‚Äôm a second rate physicist. I have the ideas but not the persistence, I‚Äôve known that about myself for twenty years. But I‚Äôve learned to position myself and to use other people to get what I want. Win win, you know, we help each other look good. You take my point?</p>
<p>Voices approach in the corridor as Highet went on in a lower tone, ‚ÄìOne path in the world is up. There‚Äôs also a path down. What there isn‚Äôt is standing still.<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Now you, friend, have been standing still [pg36] for quite a little while. I‚Äôd say you need to make some career decisions soon, before they‚Äôre made for you.</p>
<p>Flanked by two Lab factotums, Aron R√©ti came slowly, stamping his cane, into Highet‚Äôs office. His eyes, azure behind thick lenses, peered without recognition as Quine greeted him. ‚ÄìAh, my young friend, how are you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou remember Philip Quine, Aron. That beautifully sweet photon detector he built for us.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course, of course.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo here we are, three generations of first rate physics talent.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes yes, the torch is passed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI really must be</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, stay. Aron, Philip‚Äôs going to get us the data we need to silence the critics.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe critics, there is no need to mind them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrom your eminence perhaps not, but I have to deal with these fools and dupes almost daily. Do you know what a senator, a United States senator, said to me the other day? He called this place a scientific brothel.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know the man you mean. Brothels I am sure he knows well, but of science he is ignorant.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell unfortunately this ignoramus chairs a committee that oversees our funding, so I have to deal with him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSpeaking of influence, this left wing journalist, I see him here again, why do you let him in? Six months ago he abused my trust with gutter tactics of the worst sort.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean Steradian? He‚Äôs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful%20idiot" title="Wikipedia: useful idiot">useful idiot</a>. He‚Äôs so cocksure I let him hear things I want to see in print, look here‚Ä¶ Highet lifted from the desktop a folded newspaper, ‚Äì‚ÄúRadiance Research Forges Ahead‚Äù, see, this is solid gold. He‚Äôs so excited when he hears something that may be classified, his critical sense shuts off. You can see him quiver like a puppy dog.</p>
<p>‚ÄìKeep him away from me, I want nothing to do with him. What is our testing status?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe need more. As always. Classifying them has helped deflect criticism but we‚Äôre still being nickel and dimed. [pg37]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you need?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAn additional three hundred million over the next year.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI will talk to the president. This is for Superbright?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes. We can definitely show quantitative agreement with theory. It‚Äôs only a matter of time and money. Philip will tell you how close we are. He and his new assistant have made tremendous headway, just tremendous.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo? Tell me about this, my young friend.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I think it‚Äôs premature to say so. There‚Äôs a shot next Saturday. We‚Äôll know better than.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip‚Äôs too modest, that‚Äôs always been his problem.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo I just think we need a lot more</p>
<p>‚ÄìMore funding. Basically it‚Äôs a matter of funding. In the long run we see coherent beams striking out a thousand miles and diverging no more than a meter. We see a single battle station downing every missile any enemy can launch. And Aron, we‚Äôre also going ahead with your interceptors. As part of the overall system.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBaldur?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSmaller, faster, smarter, cheaper. Less than thirty billion to deploy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìEven twenty years ago I thought that this idea only needed the technology to catch up. It is good we have a history, a tradition, a culture here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLike Ulysses, we‚Äôre never at a loss.</p>
<p>‚ÄìReally? Never at a</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìUnless we‚Äôre trying to produce a thousand mile beam where no test has ever shown</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell how long do you think we can keep it up! this this</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs long as it takes.</p>
<p>‚Äìand you, Doctor R√©ti?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy young friend, I am an optimist.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip I want a word with you. Excuse us Aron. One arm clutched Quine in tight embrace and steered them into the hallway, Highet saying in low controlled tones, ‚ÄìOne day soon, very soon, I‚Äôll stop [pg38] giving you second chances. Come up empty this time and you‚Äôre through. Clear?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMeaning what? You‚Äôll what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know but it will be terrible and final and I promise you‚Äôll never forget it. Highet raised his voice to hearty amiability, ‚ÄìGood man! You let me know, and went back into his office.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As night came on the life of the building went to X Section, the Playpen, where the younger men worked on schemes even more speculative than Superbright, and Quine returned for the thousandth time to his simulation with the sinking heart of a man returning to a loveless home. Entrapment. As if fine wire had threaded his drugged veins, and now, as feeling returned, any movement might tear him open. He fidgeted the radio on to, ‚Äìfades to a reddish color as it enters Earth‚Äôs shad, and off as he saw again the tilt of Nan‚Äôs head, the fine whorls of her ear, the man‚Äôs dark hand cupping her neck. The ridge of her collarbone, the warm pulse of the vein across it.</p>
<p>On Null‚Äôs whiteboard deltas sigmas omegas integrals infinities in variegated ink still wove like fundamental forces their elegant pattern around a void. From the clutter on the desk he lifted CENTURY 21 LAB QUARTERLY. Changing world betokens larger role for science. Acceptable levels of social risk. Public does not fully understand. World free of threats too much to ask. Revolutionary new technique. Major improvement. Important to a variety of national goals. Unique multi-disciplinary expertise. Two young men, one poised to hurl a balloon, caromed past his doorway. He shut the door on guffaws and ‚Äìteach you some hydrodynamics!</p>
<p>He picked up Black 1954. He looked at the citations, then read from the start. He stopped often to reread, with a doggedness that made shift for his halt sense, once so fine, of the rhythms of scientific thought, the probe and test and parry and clinch that now required his slow and remedial attention to be grasped. As he read, his respect for Thorpe grew even as an emptiness opened with him. When he was finished he started into space before reaching across the desk to snap off the lights.</p>
<p>The phone chattered. On the second ring he lifted it, holding [pg39] silence to ear for a moment before speaking. In the darkness the computer screen, phosphors charged by the room‚Äôs vanished light, was a dim fading square.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHi, it‚Äôs Lynn, I‚Äôm glad I caught you. I‚Äôm hiking up Mount Ohlone with some friends tonight, you want to come?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know it‚Äôs short notice.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI should be working.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood heavens, all night? We‚Äôre not starting till nine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo but‚Ä¶ He scrutinized the whiteboard as if this quandary might be expressed there in double integrals. ‚ÄìI mean‚Ä¶ sure, why not.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood! Meet us at the park gate. It‚Äôs ten miles north on Crow Canyon Road.</p>
<p>In the hallway a length of surgical tubing, knotted at both ends, lay ruptured and limp in a film of water. As he left the building sprinklers came on in a silver mist and rainbows shimmered in the floodlit air. He drove out past parked vehicles and armed men in fatigues.</p>
<p>He arrived early. The sky was starry, the moon full. Some planet was setting in the west, probably Saturn by its color. The V of Taurus pointed back the way he‚Äôd come. A car approached, lights snagging in the trees, then came around the last bend lightless and rolled to a stop.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMark, Julie, this is Philip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy‚Äôre we whispering?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPark‚Äôs closed. Not supposed to be here.</p>
<p>They went around the closed gate and past a building set back among trees. In a second story window a dim line flickered, a fluorescent tube not on nor off, stuttering between states. Fifty yards further they left the road for a broad path that rose winding under black oak, then bay. An owl called, leaving the harbor of a eucalyptus.</p>
<p>Quine and Lynn walked in silence. Ahead Julie laughed and touched Mark‚Äôs arm, not a lover‚Äôs touch, but a gesture of intimacy with the world, the same hand caressing air and underbrush. They talked about people they knew, hes and shes darting in and out of audibility like moths in the dark. Soon they entered a darkness of [pg40] trees where nothing was visible but shards of the moon fallen like leaves around them. He went more slowly and stumbled. Lynn paused and he heard a rustling. Leaves popped free of a branch and came crushed under Quine‚Äôs nose, carrying to him a strong waft of mint and resin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSweet bay, she said, ‚Äìis sacred to Apollo, but this is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay%20Laurel" title="Wikipedia: Bay Laurel">European bay</a>, <em>Laurens</em>, it‚Äôs California bay, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbellularia" title="Wikipedia: Umbellularia">Umbellularia</a></em>. Her tongue lingered on the liquids.</p>
<p>They kept climbing until they broke from the woods into an open slope. Moonlight rinsed palely the open range land below them.</p>
<p>‚Äì<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia%20tridentata" title="Wikipedia: Artemisia tridentata">Artemisia tridentata</a></em>, Lynn said, inhaling as she broke from a sagebrush a twig of gray leaves.</p>
<p>It was pungent in her cupped palm. The warmth of her came with it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNamed for the goddess Artemis. Who loves it. And this is willow. <em>Salix</em>. <em>Los alamos</em>. Which is the meaning of Orpheus‚Äôs name. Who opened doors he couldn‚Äôt reenter.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow do you know all this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is where I grew up. This is the smell of my home. This is how I know I belong.</p>
<p>They came up to Mark and Julie at the edge of the grove. The moon hung above them, swollen, no goddess remontant but an airless world already mapped, trodden, and projected for division into satrapies of mining, manufacturing, and defense, occupancy deferred only until these scenarios could enrich their planners at a margin of return greater and more reliable than what current technology assured.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet‚Äôs sit here.</p>
<p>Julie passed around bread, cheese, fruit, a plastic bottle of water. On the grass they sat eating. Somewhere crickets chirred on and off, their presence like a field of energy shifting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs so warm tonight. Almost like summer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou from around here, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI went to school in the East. I‚Äôve been working around here for eight years.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPractically a native. What do you do?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI write software. [pg41]</p>
<p>‚ÄìFriend of mine works for CodeWin, maybe you know him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a big industry.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBigger by the day, said Lynn dryly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere‚Äôs the Big Dipper? I can‚Äôt see it, said Julie, standing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs too low to see, said Quine. ‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the handle above the ridgeline. There in the west, that‚Äôs Vega setting. A summer star. Winter coming in over there‚Ä¶ pointing to that swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid, ‚ÄìThe Pleiades. Also called the Seven Sisters. You can count more than seven on a clear night. But not with the moon out. And right behind them Orion, you can see him just coming over the horizon, those three stars in a line. Chasing them. Kind of a bad luck bunch, the Sisters. They were all seduced by one god or another, except for Merope, who married Sisyphus.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook! Is that a planet?</p>
<p>Finding the pale green disk where Julie pointed, a handsbreath from the Sisters, Quine knew it was the beam of a laser ten miles south stabbing to the edge of space where sodium atoms glowed in its heat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, not a planet‚Ä¶ Suddenly Lynn‚Äôs hand was in his. She squeezed it once, and before he could respond released it to run downhill toward a dark grove. He stood for a moment and then he ran too. He ran for no reason he could name, wind in his ears, an excitement rising almost to fear in his heart, hackles alive. Some presence almost, chasing him. Then the darkness of the trees was around him and he tripped and went sprawling. The presence was still there. He feared it though he knew it was benign. It was not death, but it would change his life if he let it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip? Are you all right?</p>
<p>She stood over him, at the edge of the grove as Mark and Julie approached. He lay there in anxiety, anger almost at how she‚Äôd stirred him, at the beauty of her movement, at the way her features held the moonlight.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm fine. He brushed leaf dirt from his sleeves. The presence was gone. They walked in silence until emerging from the grove and heading downslope. Overhead the green star had vanished.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo what are you working on now, Philip? [pg42]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh‚Ä¶ things in the sky, Quine said. ‚ÄìAn aerospace partner wants us to program low orbit balloons a couple of miles across, the apparent size of the moon, sunlit, carrying messages, logos, advertising‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut that‚Äôs so, Julie began and Mark cut in, ‚ÄìSeems I read about this. The Sierra Club‚Äôs bringing suit, aren‚Äôt they?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know about that, we‚Äôre just the contractors, I just do my job‚Ä¶ and Julie glancing at Lynn claimed Mark‚Äôs arm to move them away and resume in a low voice their conversation of hes and shes while Lynn walked apart, obliging Quine to follow, leaving behind ‚Äìshe sees him as a reclamation project‚Ä¶ to overtake her on a knoll. She waited with crossed arms. Behind her, the valley was filled with glittering points. At its far verge was the floodlit terrain of the Lab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, what are you doing?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt like me as a software mogul?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that your, your cover story? Her face remained still and fixed on him, moonshadow in her eyes‚Äô hollows.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat balloon thing really is a Lab project, they started a small group on it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt want to tell them what you really do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou think Mark isn‚Äôt smart enough to see through you? He is. You take his good faith for foolishness.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook I, I just didn‚Äôt know what you told them. I didn‚Äôt want you to be embarrassed by me. His face heated as he said it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, that would be my problem, wouldn‚Äôt it. Now I have a different problem. Because it happens I did tell them. She waited for something he wasn‚Äôt able to give her, then went on. ‚ÄìWhen you were talking about the Pleiades you were so, I don‚Äôt know, at ease. What happened?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, I‚Äôm sorry, I just‚Ä¶ Another breath of warm breeze and he realized he was sweating.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat happened?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat green star we saw. It wasn‚Äôt a star, it was something from the Lab. A laser test.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA Radiance laser? [pg43]</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo‚Ä¶ something else. Unclassified. A guide star for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adaptive%20optics" title="Wikipedia: adaptive optics">adaptive optics</a>.<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>She was listening with her arms still crossed. ‚ÄìWhy did that change your mood?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs just, I‚Äôd almost forgotten, about everything except, except for being here. That thing in the sky reminded me. Then Mark asked what I did‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey really have their hooks in you, don‚Äôt they.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know that.</p>
<p>Face still hollowed in moonshadow she stepped toward him. His need to be touched and take comfort welled up, but some structure unknown yet dreadful held him still. After a moment‚Äôs wait she turned to face the valley lights. ‚ÄìI‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt quit.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd do what! Turn from the one place where my, my talents have some use?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you want, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWant? I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt get it. I want eight years back. Before this I was a scientist.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey haven‚Äôt robbed you of that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs so, I gave myself over, and now I‚Äôm on the line for something I don‚Äôt care about. That‚Äôs the way, yes, you‚Äôre going to get screwed regardless, so you should make sure it‚Äôs for something that matters to you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat would that be?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>Julie and Mark were calling. They went down the slope and rejoined them. She was still talking to Mark, ‚Äìso I‚Äôm, wait, stop, this is it, these are the boundaries and he‚Äôs like, what did I do? She turned to Lynn with the pack, ‚Äìtake this? and embraced Mark from behind, arms around his chest, straps of her shortlegged overalls a dark X on her back, bare calves duckwalking the pair down the slope.</p>
<p>In the lot Lynn said to Julie, ‚ÄìGet a ride with you guys?</p>
<p>Quine called out, ‚ÄìMark, just joking about the balloon.</p>
<p>Mark looked up, fumbling with his keys, smiling. ‚ÄìOh yeah?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks, thanks for, for inviting me. He got in the car, opened the glovebox, found a tablet, brushed lint from it, swallowed it dry. [pg44]</p>
<hr/>
<p>In his apartment was a smell like stale smoke and old sweat and rotting food, edged with something fouler, like the metallic stench of the flux from the open pipe. At first he thought it came from outside, where earlier they‚Äôd been roofing. But on the deck the air was fresh. He knelt to the carpet and smelled nothing. In the kitchen he bent to the drain and smelled nothing. From a bottle he squeezed a pearl of soap onto a sponge, ran hot water in the sink, scrubbed and rinsed it. He scrubbed the stove top. The ceiling fan was silted over by grease and spiderweb. He fetched a chair and reached to touch it. A black gobbet fell from it to the stove top. He fetched pliers and freed the nuts holding the shield, banging with the handle to break the dried paint around the rim. In both hands he bore the shield like a chalice to the sink.</p>
<p>In its concavities had pooled a glossy tar. He scrubbed it for minutes, smutch washing into the sink. Then he spooled off yards of paper toweling, wet and soaped it, and climbed the chair to wash over and again the sleeve of the fan, the blades, the hub. A viscous brown residue clung to the towels and his fingers. Further into the recess, beyond his reach, was more tar.</p>
<p>Sweat soaked him. He went onto the deck. The moon was dim and reddish, as if the sky held smoke. He stared in wonder and fear until the knowledge that it was an eclipse broke upon him banishing fear and wonder alike.</p>
<p>When he went back in the smell was waiting. He understood that from now on everything would smell like this. For a while he sat at the table with his eyes shut, then opened the newspaper for the memory of CARPETS CLEANED but it parted to 24 HRS OUTCALL DAWNA and LOVE TALK $2/MIN and he stared bleakly at the sullen pout, circleted forehead, hair as wild as if fresh risen from the sea, linen garb pleated in most subtle fashion. His hand found the telephone, and after a distant chirrup a small insinuating voice flicked like a tongue in his ear, and he stepped back from the uncradled receiver, switched off the lights, leaving the voice breathing unheeded into the darkness and the moonlight pooled on the floor.</p>
<p>He showered. In the stream lust swelled in him like nausea. Hot [pg45] spray lashed him. Incoherent images flashed upon him. Runnels nudged moonwhite globs toward the drain. Depleted he toweled. On the sink were Nan‚Äôs toothpaste, hairbrush, lipstick, mascara. On the toilet tank an unzipped travel kit of quilted cotton gaped to show diaphragm, jelly, tampons, vitamins, ibuprofen, hairpins, barrette, lens wetter, a glass jar of face cream. A towelend snagged in the zipper as Quine scrubbed dry his hair, dragging the kit. Items hailed on the tile floor. He dropped the towel, then swept his hand across the sink top. He grabbed the kit and hurled it. The jar flew out and smashed against the wall. [pg46]</p>

<section id="four" class="level3">
<h3>Four</h3>
<p>Dry sycamore leaves scraped over pavement in a hot wind drawn out from distant desert by a stalled offshore low. Over the ridge east of town dust and the smell of manure from the farmlands and a haze of smoke blew fitfully into the valley. as the sun rose through layers of haze Quine, driving to the back gate of the Lab so as to avoid the protesters, passed the dead vineyard by the north boundary. He pulled over, stilling the engine and the radio‚Äôs ‚Äìty thousand acres ablaze.</p>
<p>The gate was closed but unlocked. A bright new sign bore the bio-hazard trefoil and DANGER TOXICS MITIGATION PILOT SITE ALPHA KEEP OUT. The drone of flies rose and fell like a turbine. Stunted vines clung to irrigation uprights. Bark from one sloughed like ash on his fingers. From deep in the vineyard a warm moist flatus perfused the air. A stink like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chyme" title="Wikipedia: chyme">chyme</a> of a dying beast. He ran back to the car choking and drooling. At an irrigation faucet he rinsed his mouth, his face, his hair, his hands, yet the foulness, as of corroded metal, lingered. What god loves this?</p>
<p>At Null‚Äôs desk Thorpe worked.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd Dietz called. He has to know where to put the reflectors.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm tempted to leave them where they were in the last shot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can‚Äôt do that, Highet would</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm tempted.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah he‚Äôs, he can be a real prick can‚Äôt he.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot if you play by his rules. He always has a carrot handy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I have quite a few ideas but you need to look them over, sort [pg47] of tell me where they‚Äôre out of line, you know we‚Äôre really down to the wire here and</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, let‚Äôs assume Black‚Äôs right‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh then you‚Äôve read</p>
<p>‚ÄìAssume we‚Äôre looking at quanta as localized particles guided by a physically real field‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet, you know he really grilled me on this stuff when he came out to Utah, put me through the wringer, made me prove every assumption, but after an hour I had him convinced, and I thought he really respected‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìTypical Highet slap and stroke.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow suppose we‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre good at this. And very fast.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCommercial software you know, those eighteen hour days tone you right up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo don‚Äôt touch that, we can‚Äôt change the rod array, I‚Äôve already told Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan we reorient it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe. I‚Äôll check.</p>
<p>Under Thorpe‚Äôs shaping the model gradually began to show correlation. After several hours one run produced an annulus. Then nothing for hours more. Again the annulus. He rotated the model‚Äôs rods again and again and at one angle power jumped and the annulus closed to a point. They stared at the screen. Thorpe bit his thumb. ‚ÄìWhat do you think?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt looks all right.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt looks fantastic. It‚Äôs a hundred times brighter than the last shot. But the model‚Äôs tweaked to hell and gone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt see anything wrong.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, neither do I. So now if we put the reflectors here‚Ä¶ see, this is how I work. I‚Äôm not a theorist, I don‚Äôt have your background, I need to, you know, immerse myself in the code, feel the system‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, it‚Äôs a remarkable job. I couldn‚Äôt have done this. I‚Äôve tried for months.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I couldn‚Äôt have done it if your code wasn‚Äôt so comprehensive [pg48]. You really worked at this. But it‚Äôs, you know, at some level it‚Äôs all just sort of pushing numbers around. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs saying anything real.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôll know soon enough.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you think something‚Äôs wrong?</p>
<p>Quine shrugged. ‚ÄìNothing I can see.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre not convinced.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt have to be. It‚Äôs what Highet wants, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah but, that‚Äôs not what you think I‚Äôm doing, is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause I would never do that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sure you</p>
<p>‚ÄìSince the Fish and Himmelhoch thing I have to be very careful. They were crucified, just crucified, they‚Äôre pariahs, their careers are finished. Anything remotely to do with cold fusion is tainted, you may as well say you‚Äôre working on perpetual motion. And I was on that team, I was in that lab. So I have to be very careful.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPerpetual motion, you could probably sell that to Highet. At least as a talking point.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not funny to me. I had nothing to do with that debacle, just so we‚Äôre clear on that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure. I understand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry I‚Äôm touchy. Just, you know, tired. You‚Äôve been generous, letting me work with your code and all, I really thought you‚Äôd stick me with the scut work but you‚Äôve done it haven‚Äôt you, all the test details, and let me do the interesting part. This could take me a long way and I‚Äôm grateful.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you go home, get some sleep?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, okay, I‚Äôm whipped.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake tomorrow off. I‚Äôll tell Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, I‚Äôll be in. We have to write up a work order.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll do it, don‚Äôt worry about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you staying?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGod no, what is it, midnight?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs, oh Jesus, it‚Äôs two a m.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I‚Äôm leaving in five minutes. I‚Äôll write the work order tomorrow. [pg49]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh I meant to, here‚Äôs something else for you to read‚Ä¶ and, hesitating a moment, Thorpe placed a stapled xerox on Quine‚Äôs stack, held his gaze for a moment, and departed.</p>
<p>It was a new paper by Sorokin. At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN" title="Wikipedia: CERN">CERN</a> now. Quine skimmed it as if reading news from a distant galaxy or a remote epoch. It solidified and extended the work they‚Äôd done together, the experiment that had separated them. It was clear that it was a field now, and that Sorokin owned it. He stanched an upwelling of envy and selfpity.</p>
<p>But instead of going home Quine broke apart Thorpe‚Äôs code and studied the changes. He gave the model a new set of energies: points clustered around the focus. Again, with different energies, the same focus emerged. Something was wrong, he could smell it; his instinct was not yet dead.</p>
<p>Near dawn he found it. Along with the sensor positions, Thorpe had tweaked the sensor response function. Playing the system, as he said, to get results. But now the function emphasized certain wavelengths. As might the sensors themselves when struck by the bomb‚Äôs radiation. The brightness from the earlier tests might be nothing but reflection, instrument error. When you put that error into the focusing code, the code naturally confirmed the data. Glue in a house of cards. And down in a corner of Null‚Äôs whiteboard, half erased, was it? yes, the same function, the same tweak. There in the corner of his eye for months. Wasted months. Wrong from the start. Error or fraud? No way to know. Maybe started as one, became the other. But wait now. If you removed the tweak, if you stopped trying for a beam, chaff fell from the problem and the expressions said something else entirely.</p>
<p>A presence entered the room. Air gravid and light adance. There appeared to his mind‚Äôs eye the battle station lost and insignificant in a tide of radiance, all the universe‚Äôs light at wavelengths and colors beyond mere vision, streaming in intricate brocade, weaving and mediating between matter and energy, wave and particle, the phenomenal and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noumenal" title="Wikipedia: noumenal">noumenal</a>. Here was the mystery, at last, open for his knowing as he hovered between fatigue and ecstasy, and he knew he was unready to pass through the gate of revelation into this realm of light. He drew back. And the presence like a roebuck in forest startled [pg50] and was gone. The tide of light receded. He was left with only the particulars of rods and reflectors. But he had found their flaw. Mystery might elude, but the information was sure. Thus angels must feel, radiant with the certainty that flows from their single devotion to right.</p>
<hr/>
<p>‚ÄìBernd, I need some reflectors.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFor Taliesin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know, I have a work order already, this morning, from Thorpe.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I need more.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe do not have time to add</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have to have reflectors made of something other than beryllium.</p>
<p>Dietz was silent. He began leafing through a logbook. ‚ÄìDo you know, try as we might we cannot keep traces of oxygen out of the beryllium. I have told Highet this. Long ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄìReally.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have proposed hydrogen in the past.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy haven‚Äôt we tried it?</p>
<p>‚Äì‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mess with success.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄìI see. I‚Äôd like to try it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoes Highet approve?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll take responsibility.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWithout his approval I can do nothing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd. This is what Slater thought, isn‚Äôt it. That the beryllium reflectors were giving false brightness. And Null knew it too, didn‚Äôt he.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI did not see Slater‚Äôs report. Dietz did not look up from the book.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMake some hydrogen reflectors for me. Cable them separately from the beryllium.</p>
<p>Dietz shut the book. ‚ÄìSend me a work order. I will have to send a copy to Highet.</p>
<p>Kihara came through the doors with a following of suited men.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWon‚Äôt be a minute gentlemen, don‚Äôt let us disturb you, you can see here the precision engineering we‚Äôre capable of, bang-up job of inventiveness, maximum return on investment, the answer to reversing the balance of trade deficit, innovative federally generated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technology%20transfer" title="Wikipedia: technology transfer">technology transfer</a> to industry, improves the nation‚Äôs economic competitiveness [pg51] as we work deliberately and consciously to build partnerships, a new class of information with commercial value, very creative cooperative efforts, freedom to negotiate intellectual property rights, fees and royalties, cover the technological waterfront, take for instance these fine-grained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superplastic" title="Wikipedia: superplastic">superplastic</a> steels, not to mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x-ray%20lithography" title="Wikipedia: x-ray lithography">x-ray lithography</a>‚Ä¶ and Quine returned to his office rummaging through CENTURY 21, Rings Fields and Groups, Computer Addict Wholesale Microcenter, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX" title="Wikipedia: TeX">TeX</a> Technical Reference, to come upon WORK ORDER Form 4439A Authorized Use Only, and sat for a minute holding a pen above it suddenly frozen at the sound of Thorpe‚Äôs approaching voice, ‚Äìyou have to invoke the world control option from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/command%20line" title="Wikipedia: command line">command line</a>, relaxing as the voice receded, pen moving to spell SECONDARY SENSOR ARRAY.</p>
<hr/>
<p>From Highet‚Äôs open door he heard, ‚ÄìYou want less pressure, try the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study" title="Wikipedia: Institute for Advanced Study">Institute for Advanced Salaries</a><a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a>, it‚Äôs a fucking retirement village for the reality-impaired! and a lower voice unintelligible in response, then ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt care, I want results! the lower voice growing sharper, ‚Äìis cheap. My people have to make it happen, as the door opened and Dietz, pale and shaking, came out past Quine glancing at him without a word and stormed down the hall, Highet following to the door, calling out, ‚ÄìA beard without a mustache, does that make you an honest man? and to Quine, ‚ÄìYou. I don‚Äôt want to talk to you now. Send me e-mail.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI think you‚Äôll want to hear this. We can show quantitative agreement.</p>
<p>Highet looked at him with loathing. ‚ÄìYou want to change the reflectors. The day before the shot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to try hydrogen.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs an incredibly bad idea, that‚Äôs totally braindead<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a>, to introduce a new measurement technique at this stage. You have to calibrate, you have to</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf Slater‚Äôs right, if the beryllium shows false brightness, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until we know it. It might as well be now. Or do you want to spend another fifty million on another shot?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd love to. Who told you Slater said that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs common knowledge. We‚Äôll have to address the issue eventually. [pg52]</p>
<p>‚ÄìCommon knowledge my ass.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen it might be wise to preempt questions about it. The shot‚Äôs so close to the presentation, we can‚Äôt be expected to have data that quickly. But we could say we‚Äôre investigating. If we have to.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre sure about the quantitative agreement?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe simulation‚Äôs excellent. I won‚Äôt take credit for it. Jef Thorpe did the work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid he now. Well, we‚Äôre a team. Good results show good management.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd like Jef to give the presentation.</p>
<p>Highet‚Äôs eyes fixed in calculation on Quine as the phone rang and Quine waited for the dismissive wave with which Highet ended audiences, but instead he spoke a moment, then covered the mouthpiece and said, ‚ÄìWant to make some money Philip, Devon Null‚Äôs taking on investors, and uncovering the mouthpiece, ‚ÄìYes, application‚Äôs outside the envelope no problem there, keep me briefed, and in another moment hung up, leaning back and clasping his hands over his thinning crown, gazing at the ceiling.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell that‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs very fine. Wonder if we could work up a little something. I could invite some key people to the ranch for the shot, some unnamed sources, goose the process a little, can we get Thorpe in on this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs probably in my office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou may work out yet Philip, Highet grudged as one thick finger stabbed the phone. ‚ÄìJef? Leo. Get over here, rising to pace past framed and signed photos of three Presidents, another of R√©ti and himself with the current President, artist‚Äôs rendering of the Superbright and of a fusion driven spaceship, cartoon of a mushroom cloud WHEN YOU CARE ENOUGH TO SEND THE VERY BEST, certificates from professional societies, a length of cable, a circuit board. He stopped at the window, gaze caught by something, and parted the vertical slats of the blind with his fingers, speaking softly, almost to himself.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know the darkness that‚Äôs out there? Do you realize how tenuous this all is? Twenty thousand years of civilization, and only in the last few hundred has rationality begun to displace superstition. I tell you I would sup with the devil, I would risk armageddon, not to [pg53] lose that. When I think of those fucking tree huggers out there‚Ä¶ and turning back to Quine, voice low and insistent, ‚ÄìThink the ills are in a system, think it‚Äôs that simple, R√©ti and his anticommunism, your new girlfriend and her peacenik buddies, wonder why‚Äôs she drawn to you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow wait just a</p>
<p>‚ÄìDarkness and malady is in the human heart, Philip, don‚Äôt you know that? The enemy is the heart. You can‚Äôt hide from that darkness‚Ä¶ as Thorpe entered in black linen jacket, red t-shirt, nose stud, eyes eager, and Highet‚Äôs demeanor switched to the cheerful, ‚ÄìJef, my man. I want to wow the rubes when we go to the desert. We have a ranch out there with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital%20Signal%203" title="Wikipedia: Digital Signal 3">T3</a> data lines from the test site. What can you do that‚Äôs portable and fantastic? I want flash that makes you reach for your checkbook.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve got an interface toolkit from my CodeWin days, I can throw something together. Just tell me what kind of data I have to work with.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll email you the details. Shot‚Äôs tomorrow evening, not too much for you, is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDemo or die, I know the drill, said Thorpe, grinning.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The evening wind whipped dust across the highway, vibrating the cars stopped in three lanes behind flashing lights at Codornic s EXIT NLY as Quine punched ‚Äìillion in property loss, over to ‚Äìnoninjury accident being cleared at the Codornices Road exit not blocking lanes for you, drowned in a siren blaring up the shoulder OHLONE VALLEY RESCUE ∆é∆Ü–òA‚ÖÉU·ô†MA as Quine edged against horns and unheard curses into the exit lane and cut back onto a commercial strip behind the central mall, the reverse of which colonnaded and pedimented facade, its raw concrete stained by rains, caught with a sort of wounded dignity the sun‚Äôs last rays as they likewise gilded Estancia Estates An Adult Community where Quine parked and for a moment held in his gaze a prospect of identical bungalows arrayed on lawns billiard-green out to the surveyed boundaries of chainlink and dry pasture beyond.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh! Philip. Come in. I wasn‚Äôt expecting you, your deadline‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell it‚Äôs Friday night, I thought</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm glad you, but, if you‚Äôd called I would have made dinner‚Ä¶ [pg54]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wasn‚Äôt sure I was coming.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour work is done?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs a test. I fly out tomorrow afternoon. And there‚Äôs a presentation Monday.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan you stay tonight? We can go out for‚Ä¶ is something wrong?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI need to ask you something.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes? What is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho‚Äôs the guy with the curly black hair and the good tan?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe, what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI happened to see you the other day. In a hallway. He was acting kind of proprietary.</p>
<p>‚ÄìProprie, her face flushed and she turned to look across the room, one hand resting on a table. Quine waited.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow long has this been going on?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHis name‚Äôs Ben and he‚Äôs a good friend, and it‚Äôs been, we‚Äôve been friends for years. Since before I knew you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou still see him?</p>
<p>The flush darkened, and as she turned back to him her mild features contorted into a stiff anger he‚Äôd never seen in her. ‚ÄìDo you mean, do I sleep with him? Yes. I have. Once or twice since you and I have been together.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOnce or twice. You‚Äôve lost count.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, Philip! Why are you, this is hateful!</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt hurts me, Nan.</p>
<p>Her face was a mask of plain misery. ‚ÄìWe never</p>
<p>‚ÄìNever what, laid down rules? I didn‚Äôt think we had to, I thought some things went without saying.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWithout saying what! That I‚Äôm yours alone when you don‚Äôt give me anything, for God‚Äôs sake Philip I didn‚Äôt turn to Ben for sex, just for, for kindness, for friendship, just to feel that I mattered! To someone! Five years of my life Philip, I‚Äôm no longer a young woman, do you want to know when it was I saw Ben, when I went to him after you and I were together?</p>
<p>The coldness, the absolute coldness of the moment.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt even care do you. It hurts you, but I can see in your eyes, you won‚Äôt listen to me. How can I possibly explain when [pg55] you won‚Äôt even give me credit for, for loving you, Philip? When you and I met, at that picnic, and I was so charmed by you, by your intelligence, your modesty, your reserve. Do you remember, the thunderstorm? I hadn‚Äôt seen one since moving West. And afterwards you took me home, we were drenched, and I loaned you clothes. Oh Philip, it was long over between Ben and me, he was like a brother, I just wanted to say goodbye, to tell someone close to me how happy I was. How happy I thought I‚Äôd be.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd the second time?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs all you want to hear. Two years later, when you didn‚Äôt come to dinner, didn‚Äôt call, and I waited and waited, so it was only an anniversary just a date on the calendar that‚Äôs all, but I called Ben and he came over to be with me, and he didn‚Äôt, didn‚Äôt even want‚Ä¶ cut off by her sobs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I, you know I was working, you could have</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen you come here and, and sulk for hours, barely acknowledge my existence, don‚Äôt call for days on end, then expect, how do you think that makes me feel‚Ä¶ I would have told you about Ben if you‚Äôd asked if you‚Äôd ever shown any interest at all. If you even know who I am!</p>
<p>Within him a stone fell and fell, soundlessly turning.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, talk to me! Don‚Äôt turn away like this!</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have nothing to say, and he was out the door, where streetlights had come on, knowing that his leaving now was worse than anything gone before, a withdrawal he could never make right. Don‚Äôt tell me, don‚Äôt tell me we don‚Äôt feed the emptiness in each other. [pg56]</p>

<h3>Five</h3>
<p>In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great%20Basin" title="Wikipedia: Great Basin">Great Basin</a> of Nevada thousands of acres of waste and infecund desert had been reclaimed for science as the Aguas Secas Weapons Test Site<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a>, and one hundred miles further west was the Advanced Research Institute of the Eastern Sierra, a ranch at the edge of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owens%20Valley" title="Wikipedia: Owens Valley">Owens Valley</a>, a black facility whose funding appeared in no budget. Leased to the government by a conservative businessman, it served as a layover site for Lab personnel on their way to the desert. It nestled in the broad base of a canyon near a creek‚Äôs loud runoff through lateral <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moraine" title="Wikipedia: moraine">moraine</a>. To the west the ground rose in the space of a few miles from six thousand feet to a twelve thousand foot crest of granite crags. Below, a few miles to the east, the north-south highway lay like a dropped ribbon across the wrinkled valley floor, and a hundred miles further across desert dotted with sage under a flotilla of thunderheads was the chalk white sink of Aguas Secas.</p>
<p>Even before joining the Lab Quine had seen ARIES. On his first trip west, while switching planes at Phoenix, he‚Äôd been paged and diverted to a single engine craft bound for a Kern County airstrip, where a sheriff‚Äôs four by four awaited him. The first Radiance shot had just gone off and at the ranch they were celebrating. Quine met Highet there. Highet was beating a twelve year old at chess, telling the boy, I‚Äôll trade a bishop for a knight anytime, I love knights, they leap barriers, they face eight ways at once.</p>
<p>A month later Quine was at Aguas. Rank smell of sage hovered in the predawn cool, immensities of desert air quivered to the horizon. [pg57] They drove with the sun rising behind them, the young initiates joking, group leaders and guards and observers in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department%20of%20Defense" title="Wikipedia: Department of Defense">DoD</a> hardhats silent and grim. Roadways of cables led from instrument trailers over desert pocked with the collapse craters of previous tests to the distant borehole. Above it a red crane pointed straight up. The count reached zero. And the earth rippled. A wave rushed toward them and the ground shook as if a train were passing and passing and passing. When it stopped the air was a clear plasma of exaltation. To know that the binding forces of matter were yours to break, the wealth of nations yours to squander in such sublime force, this was a deep and secret sweetness known only to the few.</p>
<p>At the ranch now Thorpe was joking with some grad students from X Section. Others were there from J Section, and some stern faces he didn‚Äôt know, military or intelligence, and Steradian alert as a corrupt deputy. Highet arrived in blue jeans and tooled leather boots, carrying cases of soda, chanting in a false twang, ‚ÄìTwaace the sugar, twaace the caffeine‚Ä¶ followed by a Western senator cadaverous and grinning in white Stetson, and his young aide plump and groomed to a sheen, with the zealous black eyes of a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pullet" title="A young hen, especially one less than one year old.">pullet</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook at em, young, brilliant, confident, said the senator. ‚ÄìThat‚Äôs how I felt at their age. They own the world.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe world? retorted Highet. ‚ÄìThey own their genitals. The rest of them‚Äôs mine, raising his voice to introduce, ‚ÄìGentlemen, the right honorable Howard Bangerter of Utah‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The aide asked if physics had yet succeeded in finding in the traces of Creation the fingerprints of God, and Highet nodded, a slow smile spreading and his tonguetip darting as his hands rose to conjure, ‚ÄìNot God exactly‚Ä¶ as Quine walked onto the deck where three barbecue grills sizzled, and a keg of COORS LITE sat amid greasy paper plates bearing the ruins of meals, and the sun had long since chased the wandering moon, itself pursuing Venus, behind the mountain wall. Although the sky retained day‚Äôs blue a chill came down from the remote and snowless peaks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis young man, Highet‚Äôs voice carried out from within, won last year‚Äôs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz%20Foundation" title="Wikipedia: Hertz Foundation">Heinrich Hertz Fellowship in Physics</a>, a prestigious award I happen to administer‚Ä¶ and Quine stepped down from the deck, crossing [pg58] dry grass to the creek‚Äôs rockstrewn willowed bank where it trickled through small pools and clumps of rotting leaves. Quine followed it upward, breath laboring. He stopped at a large boulder long ago tumbled from a higher place, and sat. Little residue of the day‚Äôs warmth remained in the shadowed stone. The western ridge above him was a great dark wave. In the east a glamour of rosetint clouds swept up from the horizon. The ranch was small below him. A cold wind came down the great wall of rock. Into this wilderness he might ascend and be lost.</p>
<p>But he returned. Thorpe‚Äôs voice came up as he slid open the glass doors, ‚Äìbackground, you know, trucks on the highway, that sort of thing. Other side of the spool you can see some small tremblors we had this afternoon. When the shot goes off we‚Äôll see more than a wiggle. But the real action‚Äôs on this screen here. At the site they‚Äôre recording everything for later analysis but data‚Äôs also piped to this workstation where this autocorrelation software gives us an immediate window on what‚Äôs happening. Red is intense energy, blue is, you know, less intense. We‚Äôre looking for sort of a red ringlike structure.</p>
<p>Quine watched the stylus quiver as about him others conversed. Without warning the stylus jerked. The screen of the workstation came to life, numbers flowing down its right edge. Colors coalesced on screen. The senator and his aide leaned in enrapt. A minute passed. Blue and green surrounded a corona of yellow and a jagged red core flecked with white.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have brightness, Thorpe said. ‚ÄìA hundred times the last test. More. Could be a thousand times.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThree orders of magnitude improvement, declared Highet. ‚ÄìAt this rate we‚Äôll have every enemy missile on Earth neutralized in a few years, and raising his tone with his glass, ‚ÄìTo Team Superbright! Leonardos of the age. You people are the best in the world.</p>
<p>Grunts and howls of triumph went off like rockets. The senator‚Äôs aide leaned smiling to whisper in the senator‚Äôs ear.</p>
<p>A second wave of guests arrived, a dozen men in suits adorned with MAMMOTH CONVENTION CENTER NAME COMPANY and a few women packaged as brightly as new software, and Quine moved off through the manic younger men hopped up by caffeine and sugar and the shot. [pg59]</p>

<p>Quine edged into a hallway and down a narrow flight of stairs as behind him music began pounding, catching as he turned a last glimpse of Thorpe, cheeks flushed, smiling at a circle of admirers the impartial smile of triumph.</p>

<p>He continued downstairs toward a light. In the cellar seven or eight young men from X Section were gathered around an old rackmounted minicomputer and a pooltable.</p>
<p>‚Äìso he goes, learn to hassle people and lie with a straight face.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcuse me, I need to get back. Does anyone know the arrangements?</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcellent advice, dude.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcuse</p>
<p>One glanced up. ‚ÄìThere‚Äôs pool cars outside somewhere.</p>
<p>Full dark. A dozen cars. E108637. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICIAL USE ONLY. Key in the column. The seat harness slid up and drew in over his chest and waist as a chime sounded and dash lights blinked red then glowed teal. The car swayed and bounced for a mile down the dirt road. There the highway stretched north and south into void, under stars like chips of ice. He could go anywhere. But time was a field that moved with him, inescapable, close as the blue light in the cabin. He drove for hours without stopping, radio for company, wash of noise, hollowness in his being. Mountains that a century ago killed emigrants with their rigors fell to his vehicle. Descending to the flats he saw brushfires crawling on far ridges like luminous cells writing some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teratogenic" title="Wikipedia: teratogenic">teratogenic</a> message across the land, and the farm cities on the ancient seabed added their sulfurous light at the meetings of capillary highways glowing with the heat of a summer long past its term, [pg62] and booming through the car‚Äôs windows when he opened them was the smell of dust, manure, smoke, exhaust, chemicals, and he crossed the last ridge into his valley of a million souls, of all the places he might go, for all the freedom he had, here again.</p>
<p>In the dark apartment he stripped, dropping rank clothes behind him on the way to the bathroom. The mirror‚Äôs sudden light showed, before selfhood interposed its protective assurance, the face of a stranger, aging and vulnerable. Lowering his eyes from the brightness he stood voiding for long seconds. A ribbon of urine twisted along the axis of its arc as it splashed into the bowl. Standing thus he blinked, faded, woke. The gates of sleep stood open and he was through them, uncleansed, as soon as he lay down. [pg63]</p>

<h3>Six</h3>
<p>Gathered before dawn the crowd set out for the main gate, to be met by police as later arrivals swelled it further, until Lab workers began to show up in their vehicles and county and city police were called to divert traffic to the north gate against the columns of people still coming, and the south road was closed to vehicles and state police summoned, and still the spectacle slowed to walking speed, so that Quine was late to Highet‚Äôs office. Highet stared out his window at the south road.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose people out there will never understand. It could be so much worse. On the other side, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed%20city" title="Wikipedia: Closed city">entire cities</a>, entire regions have no civilian industry at all, it‚Äôs all military. Here we cut our deals as needed but we still do real science. We bring in people like you. We roll back the darkness.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs a problem.</p>
<p>Highet turned. ‚ÄìWhat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe beryllium and hydrogen reflectors were cabled separately. Thorpe‚Äôs analysis at the ranch used only the beryllium. I looked at the hydrogen data yesterday. Nothing. No brightness. No beam.</p>
<p>Highet turned again to the window. ‚ÄìI see. The hydrogen reflectors which I asked you not to use. You know, I almost stopped that work order, came that close. But I wanted to see what you had in mind.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs supervisor it was my decision.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes it was. So where‚Äôs your quantitative agreement now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou saw at the ranch. The beryllium shows it. Spectrum peaks here, as predicted. But that‚Äôs not an x-ray, that‚Äôs oxygen in the beryllium [pg64] glowing at just the right wavelength. It looks exactly like the new model‚Äôs predictions for focus.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd where did this new model come from?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThorpe has been modifying my code. I found a routine of his where just this set of frequencies is amplified.</p>
<p>Highet came from the window, pacing past the photos of Presidents and artists‚Äô renderings, touching the length of cable.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo it‚Äôs all Thorpe‚Äôs fault! That‚Äôs your story?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe CASE system shows all his modifications.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI see. Well, it‚Äôs bad for him, then. Especially after Fish and Himmelhoch. He has a history.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wouldn‚Äôt call it intentional. The ideas he brought were good. I worked with him, I didn‚Äôt see this, it could have happened to anyone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt doesn‚Äôt matter. He has a history, voice sharpening, ‚Äìquackery or carelessness, you think it matters? You think you can ever walk away from your history?</p>
<p>Quine said nothing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow those hydrogen reflectors, let‚Äôs talk about these, you piggybacked your own little test onto the piggyback, that was very cute. Did Thorpe know about that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou saw the work orders.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe knew he was getting feed from the beryllium only?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt was his demo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, you saw to that. All right. We‚Äôll keep him on for a while. Then you‚Äôll write him a letter of recommendation. Down the road we‚Äôll issue a report on the false brightness. You‚Äôll be group leader on that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou want me to‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Highet‚Äôs voice was tight with controlled fury. ‚ÄìI want you to take some responsibility. Show you‚Äôre serious about this. It‚Äôs about time you moved up or got out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou begin to interest me, Philip. I thought I knew what to expect from you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAt least we caught this now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay. I listened to your story. Now you listen to me. We haven‚Äôt caught a thing yet. What we need now is another test. [pg65]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want to sound naive, but you‚Äôre not going to mention this at the presentation?</p>
<p>‚ÄìToday? I think not. I think I will not at this moment give the enemies of reason grounds sufficient to bury our project, our knowledge, our aspirations. Highet lifted from his desk a small device etched with a craft undreamed of even a decade before, raising it before him like a talisman, weighing it in his hand. ‚ÄìI believe not.</p>
<p>Nolan came through the door bearing a red folder, acknowledged Quine with a minute change of expression, as the phone rang and Highet lifted it, ‚ÄìNo I can‚Äôt see anyone right now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìVery clean data from your shot, Philip, Nolan said.</p>
<p>‚Äìno damn it I can‚Äôt Chase is coming in an hour</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, you‚Äôve seen it?</p>
<p>‚Äìwhat, what do you mean he‚Äôs here now</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe prepared the overheads. A match with theory unparalleled since Mendel‚Äôs peas.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Kid‚Äôs a barn burner is he?</p>
<p>‚Äìwell damn it keep him down there</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôd like to be.</p>
<p>‚Äìfucking hero of the people can just wait</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre taking him under your wing.</p>
<p>‚Äìdon‚Äôt care! Do whatever it takes! Have to do everyone‚Äôs job, what‚Äôs this Bran?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOverheads of the Taliesin data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, leave them. Bernd there you are find the rest of the team will you get them up where we have a little problem god damn senator arrived just a little ahead of schedule he‚Äôs downsta, Dennis where the hell have you b‚Ä¶ Nolan‚Äì!</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh! I just, sorry, didn‚Äôt see your foot</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry Dennis let me help you up‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìNolan will you get the hell</p>
<p>‚Äìmy slides! here don‚Äôt step on</p>
<p>‚ÄìNolan!</p>
<p>‚Äìjust put these back in order, with the ah integrated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-bit%20color" title="Wikipedia: 24-bit color">24-bit color</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tgif%20%28program%29" title="Wikipedia: Tgif (program)">TGIF</a> animations and music in standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI" title="Wikipedia: MIDI">MIDI</a> files</p>

<p>‚ÄìDennis will you</p>
<p>‚Äìthen our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon%20Graphics" title="Wikipedia: Silicon Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a> machine couldn‚Äôt read the TGIFs so we had to convert them to Video <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript" title="Wikipedia: PostScript">PostScript</a> but somehow they came out black and white one inch square so</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis will you please</p>

<p>‚ÄìDennis, get up! Leave the, will you leave the slides on the floor. Go to the lobby. Keep Senator Chase busy down there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I</p>
<p>‚ÄìGo! and pacing to the window, parting the blind, ‚ÄìFuck‚Äôs this going to play like, must be hundreds of them in the road.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe news said a thousand, said Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBullshit. Supposed to keep these assholes away from the main gate put them up in the north corner, I want to know how word of this got out! glaring at Quine, ‚ÄìI want to know who‚Äôs been talking to these people, who let them know Chase was coming today. Who do we have out there? Federal protective, local police, I want county I want the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%20Highway%20Patrol" title="Wikipedia: California Highway Patrol">Chippies</a>, bring out the goddamn transit cops if we have to!</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, it‚Äôs symbolic. Today‚Äôs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice%20Day" title="Wikipedia: Armistice Day">Armistice Day</a>, you know?</p>
<p>‚ÄìShit on that, it‚Äôs to embarrass us. All for Chase. Man keeps calling me up about twenty kilos of plutonium gone missing<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a>, I keep telling him we don‚Äôt stockpile plutonium here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut we do, Leo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, Bernd, Chase doesn‚Äôt have the clearance to know that, and picking up the phone midring, ‚ÄìYes? Damn it Dennis just, look, take him to the downstairs conference room think you can do that? ‚Ä¶no will you forget the fucking slides, thumbing the phone‚Äôs button, ‚Äì Where‚Äôs Szabo? You all go down, I‚Äôm right behind you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator, glad you could make it. This all? Expected to see more of your colleagues‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet. These two gentlemen are from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General%20Accounting%20Office" title="Wikipedia: General Accounting Office">General Accounting Office</a>. You‚Äôll be seeing more of them. [pg67]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you all take a seat and we‚Äôll begin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have just one question, Doctor Highet. Is the Superbright going to work?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI believe our presentation will address any</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want a presentation, I want a yes or no. At the present moment, judging from everything you have to date, is it a viable system, within the budget and timeframe we have?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBeyond question. In fact we have new results that show</p>
<p>‚ÄìA new Superbright test? When?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt discuss that in open session.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen maybe you can discuss claims of exaggeration and fraud from Warren Slater.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose are lies. Slater sabotaged my teams repeatedly. He had reasons of his own to derail this program.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSuch as?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt discuss that in open session.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSlater‚Äôs not the only critic. Some of your own people</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose are not my people. Those are people who‚Äôve made up their minds that certain technical problems are too hard to solve. They‚Äôre wrong. They could be making a contribution, but instead they find fault.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo why are you behind schedule?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre not.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAccording to your own timetable</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator, we have brilliant, creative people together here doing important work. Leave them alone and they accomplish miracles. But if you put limits on them‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre not answering me. I didn‚Äôt ask about miracles.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI am answering you if you‚Äôll let me. You cannot nickel and dime a program like this in the research phase, not if you exp</p>
<p>‚ÄìResearch? I thought you were engineering phase.</p>
<p>‚ÄìVery nearly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou sent the president a letter claiming engineering phase.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI do not acknowledge that. If such a letter were to exist it would be top secret, and you lack the clearance to see it or the competence to evaluate it. [pg68]</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet I‚Äôm tired of this, you have put in motion a program that all told has squandered thirty billio</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator</p>
<p>‚Äìyou have stonewalled, you have defied</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator</p>
<p>‚Äìgress, you have hidden behind classifica</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator, you‚Äôre an asshole. You might even be a traitor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI will not take that from you, sir!</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt have a clue what‚Äôs at stake here, one look at those hippies out front you‚Äôre ready to cave, sell out this nation‚Äôs security its technological edge its, breaking off for the figure in the doorway who bowed his head in apology.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGentlemen, we have a bomb threat. We need to clear the building.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood God.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour peacenik constituents, Chase. Good work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not through with you, Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, I‚Äôm willing to sit right here play Russian roulette.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGentlemen please, security is coming through, you‚Äôll have to move to Building 101.</p>
<p>Clipped static blurted in the hallway. Gallop of many feet approached.</p>
<p>‚ÄìClear this area!</p>
<p>Outside in the sunlight a security squad came running in a wedge, helmeted and visored, black gloves holding batons at port arms. Leather creaking, heels clattering, radios jabbering, they broke through the exiting crowd and Quine was swept the wrong way, out past an unmanned checkpoint before he cleared the surge of people onto a lawn where men in jumpsuits trailed strips of CAUTION tape on two then three sides of him and he dashed through the open space as behind him shouts were raised. Between windowless walls he took a stairway down to where two workmen rounding a corner dealt him a blow with the plank they carried, ‚ÄìJesus watch it! hurling him to his knees against a chainlink fence trembling at the lip of a great pit. In this excavation five, seven, ten vehicles labored grinding and roaring in desperate intensity, beeping hollowly as they reversed or clanking furiously forward over a terrain of pale mud. Vast as the pit was it would not bury a millionth of the dead the bombs could kill. Quine [pg69] pulled free of the fence with a tearing of fabric and went over a walkway of plywood sheets, pausing before a trailer CREDNE CONSTRUCTION in which doorway two t-shirted men eating lunch regarded him with dispassion as with a handkerchief he rubbed dirt and blood from his palms and the knee visible through ripped pants, then went down another stair of raw wood stained with mud, glancing back at concentric terraces gouged from the hillside. <em>The city is built on two levels, lords and palaces above, common workers below.</em><a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> He rounded a corner to where a stream of people hurried past guards at a checkpoint.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook I need to</p>
<p>‚ÄìMove on, there‚Äôs been a bomb threat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but I‚Äôm in an important meeting I need to get back to</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou can‚Äôt come this way, this is a secure area.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm cleared dammit! clapping his breast where no photo ID, but a torn flap of pocket depended, ‚Äìoh Christ, look my name‚Äôs Philip Quine can‚Äôt you call</p>
<p>‚ÄìMove away! The guard shoved him back into a stream of people advancing slowly toward the main gate. He made his way through and broke into a job on a path that led to the perimeter road, where he doubled back to the entry kiosk from its far side passing and passing close on his left the unending mass of protesters just beyond the fence. He stopped short of the entrance gate where cars were blocked by the leading edge of the crowd coursing out and around them like a stream around rocks, while bullhorns blared ‚Äìpersonnel, do not exit by this gate repeat do not, and outside the gate protesters swirled in place like debris at a confluence of cataracts, held back by a skirmish line of county police vainly trying to keep them separate from Lab personnel. Quine stood sweating and panting until four cars slewed to a stop on the perimeter road and discharged Lab security, one of whom leveled his club at Quine, not clearly part of either crowd, and cried, ‚ÄìYou!</p>
<p>Quine ran for the kiosk. More Lab police had arrived there, forming a wedge to divert Lab personnel from the gate. Quine was suddenly before two of them who linked arms to bar his passage. Their visors, opaque and bronze, mirrored twin Quines, elongated and dismayed. He pointed past them. [pg70]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI belong inside.</p>
<p>Then he was seized and pushed through the gate into the street. A helicopter swept overhead. He crouched under its roar, hands against his ears.</p>
<p><em>Let us now speak the truth as we know it. Say that the sun is round, and bright, and hot. Say that it fires its acolytes, darkens their skins, elevates their wormridden souls. It rises in our birth and it sets in our death. Its prints upon our flesh the spots that adorn its face. It is in us whether we labor under it, or hide away from it. It strikes through our souls, it ignites the light of our being, it limns the shadow of our denial.</em><a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>In the crowd he saw Lynn, her dark head appearing and vanishing among others, nape and shoulders bare and tanned below the cropped marge of hair, sun blazing on the straps and back of a white top.</p>
<p><em>Light is a wave and we are carried upon it. Light is a particle to pierce us with revelation. Light is the sun or the moon, a heat that tempers or a gentleness that silvers with love.</em></p>
<p>He pushed toward her. At the end of its circuit the helicopter turned and came again.</p>
<p><em>Say what you know, that love is lost. That light is extinguished. But see, loveless our souls still blaze. Our sun has not gone out, for fire comes to those who go not the way of light. See, we blaze and are not consumed.</em></p>
<p>He called her name and the call was lost in noise. The crowd shoved them together and she turned to him, eyes surprised. It was not Lynn. Pressed by the crowd they unwillingly embraced. He clung to her until another surge felled him. The cut on his knees opened and he bent to stanch it. When he rose he was among figures wearing skulls of papier-m√¢ch√© and skeletons painted on black tights. Tambourines jangled, clattered. Around him people tied kerchiefs over their faces. The helicopter roared. Its belly glistened like a spider‚Äôs, then it rocked and moved off leaving a silver mist that fell gently onto the crowd like a spring rain. Tears leapt to Quine‚Äôs face and he dropped to his knees gasping and blinded, clinging to the nearest figure, saying over and over, ‚ÄìI belong inside. [pg71]</p>

He cranked a chrome lever to reel yards of paper toweling into a basin under a faucet that every few seconds pinched off its flow like a prostatitic urethra until he banged the springloaded tap to restart it. The last of the toweling tailed into the sink and he lifted the soaked paper to his face and held it there covering the welts, regarding stolidly the unafflicted yet still unlovely right side until he recoiled ‚ÄìDamn! from moisture seeping at his shoulder, collar, and hair, and flung the toweling onto the floor, turning in vain for another towel dispenser, shaking his wet hands in the air in a desperate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mudra" title="Wikipedia: mudra">mudra</a> of fury, running them through his thinning and awry black hair before reentering the dining room where the massive figure at table six craned his broad neck around and exhaled smoke in greeting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy, you look like sumpin the cat‚Äôs all done with.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd a good morning to you too, Dan. You‚Äôre in form.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, I am. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim%20sum" title="Wikipedia: Dim sum">Dim sum</a>, a double <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona%20%28beer%29" title="Wikipedia: Corona (beer)">corona</a>, and technology transfer. It‚Äôs all a man really needs to be happy. Leo, you know Orrin Gate. Orr‚Äôs chairman of Gate Cellular. He was out to the ranch after your last shot. I think you met there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, good to, pardon my, no towels in the men‚Äôs, cut off by an obstreperous fit of coughing at the table behind him, ‚Äìenjoying the cell phone you sent, very clear signal, never a problem even in the car.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm glad. We are very good at what we do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPull up a pew, boy, here on my right, said Root, handing him as he sat a napkin to dry his face.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese allergies will kill me yet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôll have two of these and two of those, Root said, taking from a passing cart four small plates.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs this?</p>
<p>‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken%20feet" title="Wikipedia: Chicken feet">Duck feet</a>, and these are jellied.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcuse me, came a sharp voice, as Highet turned his bad eye wincing into Root‚Äôs exhalation of cigar smoke, ‚ÄìThis is the non-smoking section. [pg76]</p>
<p>Root shifted his bulk and thrust his shoulders back in thunderstruck disbelief. ‚ÄìWhat did you say, sonny?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour smoke is ruining other people‚Äôs enjoyment of their meals.</p>
<p>Root‚Äôs pale blue eyes narrowed in the fat ruddy face framed by lank gray hair and beard. The tooled ivory clasp on his red string tie rose gently and gently fell on the placket of his black shirt, and a slight smile widened his mouth.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm Dan Root. And you are? extending a hand which the other man took reflexively.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt doesn‚Äôt mat, annoyance turning to concern as he flinched in Root‚Äôs grip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRuin, is it. I guess you don‚Äôt know what ruination is.</p>
<p>Root touched the coal of his cigar against the base of the thumb gripped in his hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus‚Ä¶! as for a fraction of a second the hand writhed in Root‚Äôs grip beneath the coal, then was snatched back and cradled like a wounded pet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou best put some ice on that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre crazy! The man backed to his table staring at Root, face lit as with the fire of revelation. Root turned back to the table and set the cigar in an ashtray.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI sheerly love to take the righteous down a peg. It‚Äôs almost worth a spoiled ash.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSomeday one of your victims will call a cop, Highet said.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat man won‚Äôt call a cop. Why, until now, he thought he was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt%20Earp" title="Wikipedia: Wyatt Earp">Wyatt Earp</a>.</p>
<p>At his table the man upended a water glass and wrapped ice in a napkin. His companions bent forward in earnest discussion while the man stubbornly shook his head.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTry the parchment wrapped chicken, Orr. No no, unwrap it first. Now, Leo, what‚Äôs all this crap I‚Äôm hearing about Superbright problems?</p>
<p>Highet looked distastefully from Root to Gate and back. ‚ÄìDan, I know what an omniscient view you have from your ranch in the mountains, but some of us down in the trenches</p>
<p>‚ÄìI just want to know if we get trouble. [pg77]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is a classified program, Dan, I‚Äôm not going to start talking technical details to the unsanctified.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUnsanctified? asked Gate.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSecurity, Orr, he‚Äôs worried about security.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs right, Dan. We‚Äôre not all freelancers like you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSimmer down son.</p>
<p>Gate cleared his throat. ‚ÄìPerhaps I can start. I‚Äôll express our interest in general terms, so that any inadvertent classifications breaches won‚Äôt jeopardize you gentlemen. As I understand it, the Superbright component of the Radiance project is not coming online as quickly as anticipated. Consequently, a secondline component of Radiance may be frontburnered. This second program has aspects of interest to us outside its purposive antimissile envelope. Fair enough?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGo on.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGate Cellular is eager to enter the growing digital information market<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a>. To play in this market requires vast amounts of cable. That or satellites. The larger players have a formidable lead in the cable market, but there are parts of the globe where, for political or geographic reasons, cable can‚Äôt be laid. Some companies propose to serve these areas with a small number of geosynchronous satellites in high orbit. We think there‚Äôs a better way: a few hundred small, cheap, movable satellites in low orbit. Research and development costs are high, so we‚Äôre looking for strategic partners.</p>
<p>Root pulled from a shirt pocket some papers and unfolded them. ‚ÄìLong as we‚Äôre bein so circumspect‚Ä¶ This is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation%20Week" title="Wikipedia: Aviation Week">Aviation Leak</a>. ‚ÄúThe Slingshot orbiting interceptors kill incoming enemy missiles by impact. Simple and small enough to be deployed by the thousands, they are little more than a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camcorder" title="Wikipedia: camcorder">camcorder</a>, a guidance computer, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hydrazine" title="Wikipedia: hydrazine">hydrazine</a> thrusters.‚Äù Put a high speed switching network onboard, what‚Äôve you got.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSlingshot? asked Gate.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre calling them now, said Highet. ‚ÄìA David and Goliath thing. Little pebble of a missile knocking out an ICBM by kinetic force.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOr any other target, said Root.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDan‚Ä¶, Highet warned. [pg78]</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs I understand it, Doctor Highet, the Lab wishes to move into more commercial applications.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWish has nothing to do with it, it‚Äôs a Department of Energy mandate.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn any case, they‚Äôre encouraging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative%20Research%20And%20Development%20Agreements" title="Wikipedia: Cooperative Research And Development Agreements">Cooperative Research And Development Agreements</a> with industry, correct?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, said Highet. ‚ÄìBut Slingshot isn‚Äôt a candidate for a CRADA. It has classified components.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOrr‚Äôs application is outside the defense envelope, said Root, folding the papers. ‚ÄìI say it‚Äôs dual use.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLooked at the right way almost anything‚Äôs dual use. But DOE won‚Äôt open a CRADA on this, I guarantee you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCRADA, who wants a CRADA, I‚Äôd sooner have cancer. You‚Äôre getting prissy in your old age, Leo. You didn‚Äôt talk this way back in the days of Transfinite Polygonics.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDidn‚Äôt have a senator on Appropriations out to hang me then.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShit, Leo, you remember when you and R√©ti and me came up with these orbiters, called em Baldurs then.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDan‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìRemember? That weekend at the ranch? Hell, I got patents that overlap all this stuff. You saying I don‚Äôt have a right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, last thing we need right now‚Äôs even the appearance of improp</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs your damn trouble, Leo? Those Superbright tests?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDan, will you shut up before you</p>
<p>‚ÄìGentlemen, permit me. The press has suggested, with whatever truth, that delays with Superbright may jeopardize the entire Radiance project, including the Slingshot interceptors. Now it seems to me, if the defense value of Slingshot is seriously questioned, a parallel commercial mission could save it. It would seem wise to have that commercial mission in place before such questions arise.</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen to Orr, Leo. He knows his stuff. Orr went to school with Undersecretary Rip Whipple<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Highet dipped a corner of his napkin into his water glass and held it to his swollen face. ‚ÄìCan we get some more tea?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet, the men‚Äôs room is, where? Past that ficus? Thank you. Pardon me. [pg79]</p>
<p>Root watched Gate‚Äôs departure, then turned on Highet. ‚ÄìWhat the hell‚Äôs wrong with you? Why the hissy fit?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhipple‚Äôs about to resign, Dan.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? How come?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHis Radiance Liaison Office at the Pentagon handed out half a billion in contracts last year, all approved and overseen by the same four people. Turned out all four used to work for him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShitfire. What‚Äôs he gone do?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBack to private industry where he can make five times what he made at Defense.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd they wonder why they can‚Äôt keep good men. But so what, that‚Äôs not your problem. What is?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGot all those patents, Dan, you don‚Äôt need me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe need <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand%20Hill%20Road" title="Wikipedia: Sand Hill Road">Sand Hill Road</a>, that‚Äôs Orr, and we need the Beltway, that‚Äôs you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not exactly Beltway Bob these days.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid those test results get leaked? That shot with the sensor problems?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus Dan let‚Äôs, a little louder, let‚Äôs call CNN why don‚Äôt we. You haven‚Äôt seen it in the papers, have you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs it, isn‚Äôt it, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre sweating.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose results are classified.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs there a trail back to Null? You have to tell me that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs no trail. We‚Äôre writing a report to make our own trail.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho‚Äôs doing the report?</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe wrote the x-ray focusing code. And he supervised the shot, along with Dietz. That kid we fired, Thorpe, the scapegoat, he was working under Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs Quine like?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs a fuckup.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo why are you letting him write this report?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe and Dietz supervised the test. You know Dietz. So I tapped Quine. I bumped him up to deputy associate director.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou crazy? Deputy associate of what? [pg80]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf enough rope.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSlater‚Äôs old post.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI think people will get the message.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt trust Szabo, he‚Äôd use this to get a leg up on me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThought you had that degree thing on him.<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy waste it? Anyway Quine pulled a fast one on that test, he set up that kid, Thorpe. Very down and dirty. I want to see how he writes it up. His head may yet end up on a stick.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBetter his than mine or yours.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you want with Slingshot, Dan? You know how to do comm sats.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe want those thrusters of yours, boy. Mine couldn‚Äôt keep a bird in low orbit for a year<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a>. You‚Äôre claiming ten years? Is that for real? With those dinky little fuel tanks?</p>
<p>‚ÄìClassified.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFuck you too. What‚Äôs our lead time?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFirst tests in August. Next round of CRADAs in November.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese birds really gonna work?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus Chr, you sound like Senator Samuel Fitzfuck Chase, are they going to work, they‚Äôre <em>tests</em>, Dan, that‚Äôs why we do them, because we don‚Äôt fucking know. If we knew it‚Äôd save us all a lot of time wouldn‚Äôt it now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBoy, you‚Äôre on edge. You need a vacation. Whyn‚Äôt you come up the ranch? Take us a couple horses up to Steelhead Lake, catch some trout. Not much snow this year, gonna be an early summer. What do you say?</p>
<p>‚ÄìComing up Sunday for those Hertz recruits, aren‚Äôt I.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI mean a real vacation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm fine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy‚Äôs Chase worryin you? Our bud Howie Bangerter chairs that committee.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHowie and his Mormon butt boys.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt say that to Orr, he‚Äôs LDS.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre kidding.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI mean it. He‚Äôs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29" title="Wikipedia: Deacon (Latter Day Saints)">deacon</a> or something. [pg81]</p>
<p>Highet turned to see the blacksuited figure returning past the ficus in the hall.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGate know what he‚Äôs doing?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFive years from now he should own this market. We‚Äôre talkin billions, boy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf the crick don‚Äôt rise.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere you go. That‚Äôs my Leo. Don‚Äôt you worry now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGentlemen.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know, you‚Äôre not the only interested party, Dan. I heard from Stone last week‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìStone! You‚Äôre not serious. Any man who‚Äôll play for nickels can‚Äôt be trusted.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMister Gate, question for you, why do you want a low Earth orbit for comm sats?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease, call me Orr. A big reason to go LEO is signal delay. Geo-synchronous sats have a perigree of twenty thousand miles. By the time you‚Äôve bounced your signal off them there‚Äôs a perceptible delay. That‚Äôs not acceptable for time critical uses.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIsn‚Äôt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium%20satellite%20constellation" title="Wikipedia: Iridium satellite constellation">Motorola</a> on this turf?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, they are. But they plan to orbit fewer satellites quite a bit higher.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis seems, I‚Äôm just freewheeling here, a system this size seems like a risky commitment for an unproved market and a small company.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs why we‚Äôre looking for allies. But the market‚Äôs there. If not for cellular, for something else. As I was saying to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan%20Quayle" title="Wikipedia: Dan Quayle">vice president</a>, and Root shot Highet a glance while Highet looked bored, ‚Äìwe think of the satellites as delivery systems. We‚Äôre still looking for content providers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs a question in my mind what we get out of this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe bring to the table high speed high capacity packet switching and routing technologies. Linking the Slingshots in a networked system could make them viable for a wide range of applications. Weather monitoring, pollution tracking, global positioning‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, I think I can package that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow let me ask you this. I understand that a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement grants an exemption from [pg82] the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act" title="Wikipedia: Freedom of Information Act">Freedom of Information Act</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOur working model gives a five year FOIA exemption.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut getting DOE to sign off won‚Äôt be easy. Slingshot is a defense program, they‚Äôre sticky about that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShit, Leo‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìSurely, pardon me Dan, surely the Department of Energy can be made to see the benefit. Their CRADA program is, from what I hear, unsuccessful so far. This venture could be a showpiece for them, wouldn‚Äôt you say? And I understand that Slingshot itself has a shall we say clouded future.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan‚Äôt speak for DOE, they have trouble seeing the sun on a clear day, but I‚Äôll do what I can. We‚Äôll draft a letter of agreement, see where we go from there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcellent. I‚Äôll fax you our latest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/business%20plan" title="Wikipedia: business plan">business plan</a>.</p>
<p>Root raised his hand in a scribbling gesture and across the room the manager left the man clutching his wrapped hand and darted over to slide the check under Root‚Äôs hand freeing from a gold clip three hundred-dollar bills. Root winked at the manager. ‚ÄìSomethin for the help.</p>
<p>The three men rose and walked leisurely to the door. Gate said to Root, ‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim%20Jong-il" title="Wikipedia: Kim Jong-il">Mister Kim</a> couldn‚Äôt make it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMister Kim? said Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, another potential investor, said Root. ‚ÄìHe‚Äôs kind of a recluse.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMister Kim. That Sand Hill Road, Dan? Or Seoul?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPyongyang. He he, see his face, Orr? See it. Had him going.</p>
<p>In the vestibule they threaded through a crowd coming and going, past the phone booth where a wrapped hand rose gesticulating above the partition and snatches of talk emerged from the background din like complexities at the surface of chaotic systems, ‚Äìgot to get back I‚Äôm about to slit a cat stem to sternum, and ‚Äìsoon‚Äôs I quit I get two offers not even looking, and ‚ÄìChrist it‚Äôs hot for March, and two small boys darting either side of them, one shouting, ‚ÄìI win! I‚Äôm king of the world! as the three men emerged into sunlight and Root pushed up the brim of his Stetson and dropped the stub of his cigar to the [pg83] pavement where he ground it to smoldering pulp beneath his bootsole.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGot you a love note there, Leo.</p>
<p>Highet followed Root‚Äôs deliberative gaze from the curve of a horsetail cloud slipping across sky‚Äôs pale dome between a stately pair of eucalyptus, leaves shimmering like unheeded semaphores, flanking a squat white savings and loan 11:30 82F 28C and finally down to SFORZA and the black vinyl bib stretched across the snout of the red hood into which was tucked a parking ticket.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell gents, as the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl%20Friedrich%20Gauss" title="Wikipedia: Karl Friedrich Gauss">Karl Friedrich Gauss</a> said, Go you forward and faith will come to you.<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìThank you for your time, Doctor Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMister Gate, we‚Äôll be in touch. Dan, always a pleasure.</p>
<p>The car yelped as Highet disarmed it, Gate flinching from the sound as Root cast an arm around him, saying, ‚ÄìLeo‚Äôll eat anything that don‚Äôt eat him.</p>
<p>On the bridge, hurtling down the far span, the ticket fluttered like a trapped bird till it tore free as the car boomed past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnebago%20Industries" title="Wikipedia: Winnebago Industries">a mobile home</a> named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho-Chunk" title="Wikipedia: Ho-Chunk">that tribe</a> whose <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/CHEROKEE/2008-06/1214789071" title="Little Brother Snares The Sun">tale of</a> <a href="http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2001/Jun/10/tell-me-a-story-little-brother-and-the-sun-a/?print=1" title="TELL ME A STORY: Little Brother and the Sun (a Winnebago Indian tale)">Little Brother</a>, so similar to that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaeton" title="Wikipedia: Phaeton">Phaeton</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios" title="Wikipedia: Helios">Helios</a>, did not punish but rewarded its hero with wisdom and respect for his snaring of the sun, and raced mere feet above the bay, accelerating past NO TOLL THIS DIRECTION and the leaching pools and the industrial parks, one hand scanning past ‚Äìit‚Äôs your constitutional right! to an orotund voice that had ‚Äìnothing to be ashamed for! as the freeway broadened to eight lanes sprawled like a flattened snake up green hillsides turning gold so early in the year after ‚Äìseventh year of drought for Cali, while elsewhere, ‚Äìflood waters so severe, seemed to demonstrate the chaotic extrema of a global climate under assault by the effluvia of ‚Äìtraffic and weather togeth, until, satisfied for the moment that no news, of himself at least, was good news, Highet silenced the radio and slipped a silver disk into the slot of the CD player to let the doomed guitar of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20Johnson" title="Wikipedia: Robert Johnson">Robert Johnson</a> carry him back to Codornic s EXIT NLY and past the city‚Äôs central mall, cutting across a chorus of horns and around Estancia Estates, where CREDNE CONSTRUCTION earthmovers pushed back still further the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaparral" title="Wikipedia: chaparral">chaparral</a> behind the open frames of identical [pg84] unfinished houses, and banners flapped in the hot wind STARTING AT $150,000.</p>
<p>Coming then to the main gate of the Lab, fortress city of ten thousand souls behind razorwire, slowing past the demonstrators in their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motley" title="Wikipedia: motley">motley</a>, with their handmade signs FRAUD DECEPTION STOP NOW, the darkhaired woman absent today, the woman he‚Äôd first singled out for heckling because of her beauty, Highet swerved to flatten a rolling paper cup under his wheel, stopping at the kiosk to show ID, ‚ÄìMorning, Jake, and continuing through the doubly fenced desert of broken rock and motion sensors, into Building 101‚Äôs parking lot, RESERVED DIRECTOR, noting with distaste Philip Quine‚Äôs battered white Subaru parked at the far end near a yellow backhoe &lt;&lt;ULTRA-DIG&gt;&gt; beyond which rose the terraced adumbration of a building, its southern facade cloaked in mauve and avocado tile while the northern half, an unfinished cliff of raw concrete spattered with pale mud, fell away to a terrain of rutted earth and pools of bright green flux, all enclosed by chainlink and plywood sheets stenciled ADOBE LUMBER and CREDNE, the halfmade bulwark oddly deserted by its builders although the workday was at its height.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMorning, Dolores, as he entered the outer office, frowning at the radio declaiming in carefully modulated outrage, ‚Äìtypical liburrul modis operendy. He calls my logic cheap and my facts hazy and my reasoning fellatious, until Dolores reached the knob to silence it, and Highet plucked the Ohlone Valley Herald<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> from a box of mail in which a smaller carton held two and a half doughnuts, ‚ÄìThink we can keep the jelly off the correspondence? rounding the desk to come ‚ÄìOw! hard against heavy boxes sealed with a gray cover sheet Final Environmental Impact Statements and Report For Continued Operation of Laboratories.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGeez, you look just awful. Take a doughnut if you want.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks so much Dolores. Might as well, there‚Äôs most of one on the newspaper already. What‚Äôs all this junk?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the EIS back from the printers, you wanted three copies.</p>

<p>‚ÄìHe was. Your new computer arrived. You have</p>
<p>‚ÄìAt least something went right while I was gone.</p>

<p>‚ÄìWhy‚Äôs the network down? Conor! Get him in here.</p>
<p>‚Äìand you have a one o‚Äôclock</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt remind me, as he pushed open the inner office door and the voice rose up again behind him, ‚Äìmy friends, it‚Äôs demonstrative that, and the door swinging wide banged a tower of cartons, ‚ÄìFuck! toppling them in a spill of bubblewrap, styrofoam, spiralbound manuals, warranty cards, and cables bagged in plastic across the floor to where a black box <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" title="Wikipedia: NeXT">aXon</a><a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> with matching monitor, keyboard, and printer sat on his desk. Highet put down the newspaper and the doughnut and his blunt fingers touched its matte surface, which took briefly their sweaty imprint then swallowed it like mist<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a>, as Conor entered yawning, slim to frailty in a black t-shirt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin" title="Wikipedia: Serotonin">SEROTONIN</a> C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, fine black hair in a ponytail, trim mustache and beard, a reliably complaisant witness to Highet‚Äôs pleasure or displeasure.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry about the mess, boss, I‚Äôll clean it up. I didn‚Äôt know if you wanted to keep the boxes. What‚Äôs wrong with your face?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy face? Not a thing. Feel good about yourself, Conor, the world will love you. Is this thing sexy or what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt rocks. Conor stooped to gather cables, deftly mating socket to plug, snugging keyboard and mouse. The machine gave out a suave chord and the screen lit with chiseled icons bright along its border.</p>

<p>‚ÄìIs that why you took the network down so I have to collect my messages by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sneakernet" title="Wikipedia: sneakernet">sneakernet</a>?</p>
<p>‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%20%28negative%29" title="Wikipedia: Mu (negative)">Mu</a>, o master. We had a little incident. Somebody put some pornographic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF" title="Wikipedia: GIF">GIF</a> files up on an open server. We had to take it offline. Unfortunately it was also a mail server.</p>
<p>Highet grimaced. ‚ÄìChrist, don‚Äôt people have anything better to do with themselves? How long were the files there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe creation dates vary. Days, months, don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis was on an open server? Save the files, I want to know what‚Äôs going on there. Now what about my mail?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBehold the little mailbox. Every time you boot, he knows to check for spooled mail on the server, and there, leaning in to smartly tap the black teardrop mouse, ‚Äìyou are.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre those my messages from Dolores? Okay, you can keep your job. But get rid of these empty boxes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you want to store them?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou kidding? Shitcan them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd the manuals?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe don‚Äôt need no stinkin manuals, pivoting with one hand to type in his password ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ and burst open the iconic mailbox as Conor hovered nosily.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChaos on the edge of complexity?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust the usual noise. Now clear out of here and let me start taking out the trash. Come by at four and we‚Äôll talk about your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor%20instability" title="Wikipedia: Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability">Rayleigh-Taylor</a> project.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCool.</p>
<p>As the door closed Highet slumped back in his chair. His breath came harshly and with suspensions. In his bowels dim sum moved restlessly. Opening his eyes he stared blankly at a slick card aXon Warranty Tell Us About Yourself, picked it up, and flipped it spinning to ricochet from the lip of the trash can to the carpet.</p>
<p>He took the Ohlone Valley Herald and cellular phone into his private bathroom, resting the newspaper on the sinktop while he unfolded [pg87] the phone, loosened his belt, lowered his pants, settled sighing onto the seat, and then punched SEND. ‚ÄìDolores? Get me an hour in the gym at four. Yes I know, don‚Äôt remind me, punching END, raising the newspaper to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney%20King" title="Wikipedia: Rodney King">Grand Jury Indicts 4 LA Cops</a>, Estancia Expansion Given Green Light, turning to the editorial page where, ‚ÄìSon of a! welts on his face reddened as he took the phone, selected a number from its display, punched SEND and waited. ‚ÄìDoctor R√©ti please. It‚Äôs Leo Highet, and scanned the text, post-Cold War era, needless expense, environmental hazards, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace%20dividend" title="Wikipedia: peace dividend">peace dividend</a>. ‚ÄìAron, have you seen today‚Äôs Herald? What? Oh, that went fine, I think Gate‚Äôs on board. But the Herald, listen to this, lead editorial, Stop Nuclear Testing Now. What is this crap? We employ ten thousand people, we <em>made</em> this fucking cow town, where does he get off? No, don‚Äôt placate me! I don‚Äôt care about the editorial, paper‚Äôs a joke and everybody but Greer knows it, I just want to know why he‚Äôs getting feisty. And it‚Äôs not just him, I‚Äôve got calls in from Chase, DoD, DOE, the vice president I mean what‚Äôs going on? Who‚Äôs talking to who? Yes I‚Äôll be here the rest of, wait, got a meeting at one but I‚Äôll have Dolores put you through. Find out what you can, pressing END, and the phone instantly trilled in his hand and he shifted his nates, sighing. ‚ÄìHighet. What is it, Dolores. Tell her, no, never mind, I‚Äôll take it. Hello Thea, how‚Äôs mother. Uh huh. Yes I did. Well, they‚Äôve done what they can. If it‚Äôs chronic, there‚Äôs nothing‚Ä¶ no, I, look, Thea, she‚Äôs seventy-eight years old, she‚Äôs had a full life. No. No I can‚Äôt poss. Well, you do what you like but I. Thea, are you listening? I just said I can‚Äôt. I run a billion dollar laboratory here, I can‚Äôt just take a week off and come to Lancaster, it‚Äôs out of the. Look, don‚Äôt start. Call Mark and hassle him why don‚Äôt you. Uh huh. Thea, lis, Thea, listen to me. I‚Äôm hanging up. I don‚Äôt have time for this. I‚Äôll call you when you‚Äôve got mother home. Goodbye, Thea, pressing END, ‚ÄìJesus suffering Christ, and dialing again to wait through, ‚ÄìThank you for calling the Ohlone Valley Herald, if you know the extension of, and punched 4 3 1, refolding the newspaper and spooling off a length of toilet paper while waiting through ‚ÄìJ Frank Greer is not in his office right now. If you would like to leave a message, please wait for the tone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJ Frank, it‚Äôs Leo Highet. You know, out at the lab, where your [pg88] son works, I‚Äôm in a small room with funny furniture. Your editorial is in front of me. Highet rustled toilet paper at the mouthpiece. ‚ÄìNow it‚Äôs behind me. He snapped shut the phone.</p>
<p>He rose then, wiped and flushed, gazing like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haruspex" title="Wikipedia: haruspex">haruspex</a> at the spiral arms of the swirl as the auguries were swept away. Red pepper, sausage, pasta. Fragments rose in the ebb unflushed and he flushed again. In the miasma was a faint scent of asparagus. he washed his hands. At the doorway, hitching his belt, he thumbed on a fan and shut the door behind him as both desk phone and cellular phone trilled together.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAlready? Thank you Dolores. He glanced at his watch, and took a folder from the desk drawer, opening it to confirm its contents and stepped over the threshold where the toe of his loafer came down on aXon Warranty Tell Us skidding him past Dolores startled from YOUR IMAGE YOUR SUCCESS How To Polish Your Management Style to turn down ‚Äìfriends, I am the epitome of, as he caught his balance to stride out and down the hall, pausing outside the conference room just long enough to hear, ‚Äìtherfucker can‚Äôt imagine anyone doing anything for decent reasons, he thinks everybody has an agend, silenced by his entrance into air stifling as a bunker under high sealed windows like embrasures.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMorning Leo.</p>
<p>Dietz, Szabo, Karp, Quine, sitting there, sweltering, jackets over their chairs, shirts spotted with sweat. Looking at his swollen face. No one saying what they thought. Highet laid down his papers, put on halfglasses, and remained standing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLike an inferno in here, what‚Äôs the problem?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI called physical plant. They say the air conditioner‚Äôs screwed up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs really great, we need physical plant to tell us that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey say they‚Äôre working on it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about the other conference room?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre painting it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought we painted it last year. Oh, I remember, one of those idiotic use it or lose it budget items. Speaking of which, where‚Äôs Kihara? I asked him to be here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe, ah, said he had a brush fire to put out. [pg89]</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe say what it was?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSomething about an EIS.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, did you take that meeting with Jeremy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29" title="Wikipedia: Rector (ecclesiastical)">Rector</a> this morning?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, sir. Him and two other federal-looking gentlemen from the General Accounting Office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôll be back.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, let‚Äôs start without Kihara. Yes, what is it, Bernd?</p>
<p>Dietz rose and held out a white envelope, its end trembling. ‚ÄìI must tell you. I cannot continue here. For a long time I have known this. I hear rumblings, it is like a great building with a bad foundation, a few cracks appear, the collapse begins, no, I cannot stay on, this is my resignation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd, sit down‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìLast night someone from CNN calls my home, to ask about charges of fraud.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid this someone identify himself?</p>
<p>‚ÄìArmand Steradian.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWasn‚Äôt he that PBS guy used to hang around here, Leo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìEx-PBS. After that backstabbing special of his I made some calls. He‚Äôll never work for them again. What did you tell him, Bernd?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNothing! But I can read the writing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd, you‚Äôre overreacting. This is nothing more than our friend Chase leaking rumors. If he had anything real, he wouldn‚Äôt be phoning in anonymous tips to Chicken Noodle News. Show some nerve. He‚Äôs just waiting for someone to bolt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I tell you I cannot</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd. Do me a favor. Put that envelope back in your pocket. Keep it there over the weekend. If you still feel this way on Monday, we‚Äôll talk.</p>
<p>Highet looked around at the rest of them. Not saying what they thought. Sweat ran down his ribs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm glad Bernd brought this up. It‚Äôs stressful but it‚Äôs nothing new. The Radiance program has some unresolved issues, we know this. We also know that we can resolve them. But in the meantime our [pg90] critics are getting vocal. Is there anyone here who can‚Äôt take the heat?</p>
<p>Dietz glanced at Quine. The others held their poker faces.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay. Let‚Äôs move on to business. You all know how DOE is talking up dual use technologies. We hear this so often, the old plowshare polka.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDual use technologies, said Szabo. ‚ÄìI‚Äôve got one of those in my pants.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks Frank, I‚Äôm sure we all</p>
<p>‚ÄìLooked so nice out this morning I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd</p>
<p>‚Äìappreciate your wit. Here‚Äôs my point. This is an opportunity. We can start moving Radiance technologies under the dual use envelope.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about the GAO investigation? asked Karp.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not worried. The report isn‚Äôt due for a few months. You‚Äôve all given your interviews, right?</p>
<p>Quine was readying to speak. That habitual wounded look. Always about to flinch. As Quine‚Äôs mouth opened, Highet spoke.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, you were reviewing the recent Superbright tests. Where are you on that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm finished, pulling several spiralbound xeroxes from a black nylon carryall.</p>
<p>Highet stared in disbelief. ‚ÄìI thought your timeframe was longer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm done.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, hold those. It‚Äôs not appropriate to discuss them now. Not till we‚Äôve all seen them.</p>
<p>The wounded reproach in Quine‚Äôs eyes did not flinch but hardened. ‚ÄìI thought I‚Äôd distribute them now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI said hold them.</p>
<p>Something like rage there now. But no followup. Highet held his gaze for a second longer as Quine fingered the bindings.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo, future directions. We‚Äôve got CRADAs in x-ray lithography. Fusion research can cover a lot of programs. Frank, talk with P Section and see what all we can get under their umbrella. We‚Äôre looking at reduced underground testing, very possibly a full ban. Bitter as that is, it‚Äôs an opportunity for computer science, simulation codes, and for hydrodynamic and hydronuclear testing. What else, people? What else can we package? [pg91]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs the toolmaking code we gave GM a few years back.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA lot of astronomy stuff could fall out of our adaptive optics work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAstrophysics is always good cover.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have fabrication techniques that could prove adaptable to commercial manufacturing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìVery good, thank you, Bernd.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll this is more like a garage sale than technology transfer, said Szabo. ‚ÄìWhat about the Slingshot orbiters? Plenty of potential there.</p>
<p>Highet looked thoughtful as sweat slicked his inner thighs. ‚ÄìReally. What kind of potential?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, lots of things. They‚Äôre just orbital platforms. Off the top of my head, astronomy, weather monitoring, comm sats‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about the classified elements?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMost of the Slingshot tech is off-the-shelf. It‚Äôs a matter of what you put on them. Different hardware, different software, that‚Äôs all.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan you write a white paper on this, Frank? Identifying areas outside the security envelope?</p>
<p>‚ÄìKind of busy right now. But yeah, I could.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo it. The rest of you, I want something in writing about programs in your areas.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, before we, can I just bridge in here? What‚Äôs our advantage going after this stuff? Karp leaned crossly forward, bare forearms resting on the conference table‚Äôs oak veneer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy, Henry, said Highet, ‚Äìwe get the satisfaction of enhancing America‚Äôs global competitiveness.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo we go from national security to appliances? I‚Äôm not very excited about that. I remember the last time we did this crap, designing wind turbines in the seventies. About as sexy as bell bottoms.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was there, Henry. Labels change, the work goes on. You all know I‚Äôve got the entire Lab to consider, but you also know this is where my heart and history is. Nuclear design, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directed%20energy%20weapons" title="Wikipedia: directed energy weapons">directed energy weapons</a>, missile defense, this is our work, the work of the age. I won‚Äôt let anyone cut the heart out of our mission.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI hate this shuffle, complained Karp. ‚ÄìWe‚Äôll have crackpot realists coming down off the woodwork to get on the gravy train. [pg92]</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf we don‚Äôt get it the pickpockets will.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs right, Frank, said Highet. ‚ÄìI know it‚Äôs a pain in the neck. It‚Äôs meaningless and it distracts. But rise to the challenge, people. Think of it as diversifying our portfolio. Anything else? Then let‚Äôs get out of this fucking sauna. Philip, in my office.</p>
<p>And like Virgil quitting the underworld, damp thighs chafing, he led Quine to his office pausing to hold the inner door for the younger man to pass in first, then following him in with a slam. Quine flinched.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt you ever try that again. Make an end run around me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìEnd run? You assigned me this report, you</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt tell me what I did!</p>
<p>Quine dropped the bound xeroxes on Highet‚Äôs desk, An Analysis of False Brightness Readings in ‚ÄúTaliesin‚Äù Test of Radiance ‚ÄúSuperbright‚Äù X-Ray Laser Component.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is my draft report, submitted for comments exactly according to protocol, exac</p>
<p>‚ÄìProtocol! Don‚Äôt give me protoc, breaking off to grab from the desk an inhaler, glaring over its barrel as he pumped it, then, after inhaling noisily, ‚ÄìWhere, just where do you get off, returning this favor I did you, the great favor of letting you head this group, of promoting you to director level, you repay me with this bullshit? I‚Äôm speechless. It is understood that you run this kind of report by me privately, first as a courtesy and just incidentally so you don‚Äôt make an ass of yourself.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll risk that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo you won‚Äôt, you‚Äôll sit down this minute and we‚Äôll go over it line by line. Dolores will clear your afternoon, reaching for the phone which trilled stopping his hand momentarily before he lifted it. ‚ÄìHighet. Yes, Aron, what have you got? EIS? What‚Äôs that got to do with. No, it‚Äôs just back from the printers I haven‚Äôt even opened, it‚Äôs six enormous vol.¬†Oh Christ, not those jerks again. All right, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll. Yes I‚Äôll deal with them. Don‚Äôt excite yourself. Never mind the EIS, I need, never mind it, I need to know about the Taliesin test. The last Superbright shot. Whether those results were leaked. You haven‚Äôt said anything to anyone? Okay, I think someone here is selling us out, glaring at Quine. ‚ÄìNo one‚Äôs called you? Okay. Well, you say no comment, [pg93] of course. Call me if you hear anything at all.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not going to do this, said Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcuse me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not going over this document with you. I‚Äôll put it through channels.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you think you‚Äôre playing at, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou, you think this is some kind of game, winners and losers, the screwers and the screwed, think you can change reality by, by wishing, by lying by</p>
<p>‚ÄìPeople like you, Philip, you suffer reality. I make it happen. That‚Äôs not game. It‚Äôs serious <em>because</em> you win or you lose. It‚Äôs you fucking amateurs who screw things up.</p>
<p>The phone trilled again. ‚ÄìDolores, hold my calls. What? Tell him, no, send him in.</p>
<p>Dennis Kihara entered bearing six hefty gray volumes cradled in his arms then skidded ‚ÄìLook out! across the carpet, stumbling to a stop at Highet‚Äôs desk where he deposited his burden and bent to pick up, ‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs this, Tell Us About Yourself, looks like a warranty c</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll take it, what‚Äôs your problem Dennis?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe EIS, have you seen? well of course you have, here, page IV-C-238 let me, oh sorr</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis, just</p>
<p>‚Äìbecause we wait, let me, Map of Planned Construction, see, right next to Building 101</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs us right where we‚Äôve always been.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell it‚Äôs, gosh, I reviewed this map myself, and I don‚Äôt know how it happened but we have to issue an erraticum.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs the problem?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell look!</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a map, it</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, there, out the window! following the point of Kihara‚Äôs trembling finger past the slatted blinds to a bleached sky half obscured by a mauve and avocado facade.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt like that tile, looks like a men‚Äôs room, but what are you</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not there!</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis what are you [pg94]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe building, the new building‚Äôs not on the map!</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs ridic, scanning the foldout graphic and the text across from it dotted with gray overprinting designating changes from the Draft document, ‚Äìwell that‚Äôs unfortunate but hardly a major, we‚Äôll just issue an erratic, I mean an erratum.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe need to send it asap, I have a list, I tried to e-mail you but the network is down.</p>
<p>‚ÄìList of what.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf people and places I contacted.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI just, I, I called some places to advise them that there were problems with the EIS, didn‚Äôt go into detai</p>
<p>‚ÄìCalled what places.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I started with our FedEx list. Congressional offices and citizens‚Äô groups mostly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìReally. Ink‚Äôs not dry and you‚Äôre on the horn telling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalPIRG" title="Wikipedia: CalPIRG">CalPIRG</a> CANT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpeace" title="Wikipedia: Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> and Senator Chase that we have some reality problems, that‚Äôs just great, just incredibly efficient Dennis.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell thanks I just, you know, it‚Äôs my job</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake the rest of the day off, let me handle this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh no, I couldn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs my mistake.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes it is, but you‚Äôve done so much already.</p>
<p>Kihara glanced from Highet to Quine uneasily. ‚ÄìWell, I</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll come back later, said Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo you won‚Äôt. You stay right there, transfixing Quine with all the fury he kept from Kihara. ‚ÄìDennis, what I need from you right now is a list of everyone you called, pushing a blank sheet of paper across the desk.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, I can email you</p>
<p>‚ÄìI said now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I think I can remember most of‚Ä¶ Fumbling, he unclipped from his shirt pocket a blackbarreled pen, nesting barrel in cap as [pg95] Highet calmly waited and watched Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know, Dennis, nobody notices an oversight like this in a document this size unless you point it out to them. What you do is you wait a few months, and then you file an appendix buried in a bunch of other documents. Like a cat you hide your shit in the sand, you follow me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìUm, yes, okay, I‚Äôll, yes I think so. The pen hesitated and continued.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you don‚Äôt ever, ever tell the people who want to shut us down that we fucked up. These people are the enemy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry, I, here‚Ä¶ pushing the sheet to Highet with one hand as the other returned pen to pocket, clipping it in place.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt apologize, it makes you look weak. Just never do it again. If there‚Äôs ever a question in your mind, ask me. You‚Äôre sure that‚Äôs everyone?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI, yes I think</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about CalPIRG?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh yes that‚Äôs right</p>
<p>‚ÄìNever mind, I‚Äôll add it. You get any callbacks?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, Lynn Hamlin, and Highet saw Quine tense, so he did know her, ‚Äìfrom Citizens Against Nuclear Technology, she wants me to speak at a meeting tonight.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo chance. Forget it. What time is this meeting?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSix p m at the, ah, First Unitarian Church of Kentwood, open forum on, let me see, the role of the Lab in a post Cold War</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, well, they can open it without you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôve invited a speaker, Tony Luz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLuz? That prick. We went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caltech" title="Wikipedia: Caltech">Caltech</a> together. Makes him think he knows science.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, he‚Äôs fairly well known, I thought another point of view</p>
<p>‚ÄìAdman turned enviro. Don‚Äôt loan him credibility. Got a little problem there, Dennis.</p>
<p>A round black stain had spread across Kihara‚Äôs shirt pocket where the pen was clipped.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI, what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour pen is leaking. [pg96]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh? looking down in confusion to pluck it out with a snap, staring in chagrin at the silver clip on the cap topping the black barrel narrowing to an exposed gold point. He dropped it ‚ÄìDamn! on the desk, touching the stain futilely with fingertips that came away darkened, as Highet pulled two tissues from a box. ‚ÄìDamn, damn‚Ä¶ holding the tissues as he gathered the volumes to his chest. Highet followed to push the door shut almost on his heels.</p>
<p>Highet capped the pen and clipped it in his own pocket. He looked at Quine in silence for a moment. ‚ÄìI‚Äôm too good natured. I like to give people a chance. Guide them along. Like you, Philip. I promoted you, I gave you this opportunity, handpicked you to manage this report, told everyone to cooperate with you. You let months go by, you don‚Äôt talk to me, and now you drop this, this sack of shit on me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe, the whole point of an independent</p>
<p>‚ÄìIndependent? The hell you think you‚Äôre doing! You want to go it alone? Like Slater? You want to see firsthand what happened to him?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSlater, yes, and Dietz</p>
<p>‚ÄìDietz, defecting in the middle of the fucking meeting, did you put him up to that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs been trying to see you all week, you don‚Äôt even answer his e-mail, and, and Slater, they knew, didn‚Äôt they, that the computer model was rigged from the start, all the way back to Null.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow it‚Äôs Null‚Äôs fault? Thought you were blaming young Thorpe. Keep your scapegoats straight. The fact is it‚Äôs your model, Philip, your computer code, and if anyone goes down for this</p>
<p>‚Äìbut you put me on it, didn‚Äôt you, gave me Null‚Äôs code and the bad data from earlier tests, let me waste over a year on something you knew couldn‚Äôt work until Thorpe tweaked it to give those bogus results</p>
<p>‚Äìbehind Thorpe‚Äôs back, that stunt you pulled with the backup reflectors, I should never have let you</p>
<p>‚Äìbecause otherwise no one would have known, that was the heart of it, wasn‚Äôt it, those beryllium reflectors, they glowed exactly as the model predicted, but they weren‚Äôt measuring anything but their own radiance, the backup reflectors showed just a spike in the background noi</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen to yourself, you‚Äôre saying that even your backups showed [pg97] brightness</p>
<p>‚Äìsix orders of magnitude below what you claimed, six orders! a million times less! and twelve orders from what you promised, you overstated the power by a billion times! and you knew it all along, how did you think you could get away with, fake something like that at the heart of this program?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWatch what you say about what I did and didn‚Äôt know, and be very careful about using that f-word, because it‚Äôs your problem, you‚Äôre the one who couldn‚Äôt do your job! So don‚Äôt tell me what I know, I know it can be made to work, but you couldn‚Äôt do it!</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou think you can do science by PR, by</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you think this, pacing to the wall and tapping the framed facsimile of <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/hsteu401/Leonardo%20letter.pdf">an ancient letter in a small precise hand</a>, ‚Äìwasn‚Äôt PR? ‚ÄúItem, I have a model of very strong but light bridges, Item, I also have models of mortars, Item, in case of need I will make large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombard%20%28weapon%29" title="Wikipedia: Bombard (weapon)">bombards</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar%20%28weapon%29" title="Wikipedia: Mortar (weapon)">mortars</a>, and firethrowing engines of beautiful and practical design, in short, whatever the situation, I can invent an infinite variety of machines for both attack and defense‚Äù, sure, think this wasn‚Äôt blowing smoke, think Leonardo had ever built any of these, think he had off the shelf hardware ready to go, no, but he got the job and he did it all, gave [Ludovico] Il Moro satisfaction for nineteen years didn‚Äôt he</p>

<p>‚Äìand Slater, don‚Äôt give me Slater, a fuckup and a substance abuser, little lesson for you there</p>
<p>‚Äìand just who is this Devon Null? Nobody in J Section has ever seen him, one day I‚Äôm sharing his office space, the next all his books papers folders xeroxes are gone, cleared out, personnel won‚Äôt even give me his employee records</p>
<p>‚ÄìAsk your girlfriend. I mean the one in personnel, not the one in the antinuke group. Although with the information sieve around here the other one might have them too.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat business of yours</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy business is to keep this place going, you want to walk around here on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valium" title="Wikipedia: Valium">Valium</a> making wild accusations remember that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow wait just a [pg98]</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou consider this report finished, is that right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine. I‚Äôm accepting it. You‚Äôre done. Your group‚Äôs dissolved. You‚Äôre on leave. Now get out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow wait a</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you hear me? Out, now!</p>
<p>For a moment Quine stood, then zipped shut his empty carryall and went out past a slender young man carrying a calfskin case who looked up from Dolores and in at Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, Doctor Highet, I just dropped by to set up a meeting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you come in for a minute, Jeremy, holding the door as his eyes followed Quine into the corridor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want to barge in‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I‚Äôm glad to see you. Just one minute, as he went around the desk to lift the phone with one hand and with the other casually pulled open a drawer and swept An Analysis of False Brightness into it. ‚ÄìDolores? I want drug tests immediately for all employees in J Section. Yes, I mean this afternoon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm glad that‚Äôs not my investigation, the young man said, smiling.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo, Jeremy. How was the meeting this morning? I‚Äôm sorry I missed it, you know how it is, complexity on the edge of chaos. Frank Szabo take care of you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt went well. There are one or two points I think we‚Äôll take up in a future meeting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat points?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWritten statements from Doctor R√©ti to the president and the secretary of defense. They seem to overstate the Superbright‚Äôs power by a substantial amount.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor R√©ti is emeritus here. He‚Äôs not involved in daily operations, so he may not be completely up to speed on Superbright details. But he can still express his opinions as a private citizen.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, yes, but on Lab letterhead?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe keeps an office here, it‚Äôs natural he‚Äôd use the stationery. I wouldn‚Äôt make too much of it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt you, ah, review his official letters? [pg99]</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo. Why should I?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, you are the director.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJeremy, put yourself in my place. R√©ti‚Äôs the founder. He‚Äôs a living legend. I can‚Äôt vet his correspondence.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, but, even compared to your own test results, his estimates of the beam‚Äôs power are high by a factor of um, a billion? He says that the last test, Taliesin was it called? indicates a major breakthrough?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe saw substantially increased brightness. A billion times? No reason the beam couldn‚Äôt be made that bright.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor R√©ti used the words ‚Äúengineering phase‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOur bottleneck isn‚Äôt the science, it‚Äôs the funding.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, concerns have been raised, you don‚Äôt mean the GAO‚Äôs investigation hinges on a couple of letters, do you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, but even your own numbers from previous tests have been questioned by some of your own people</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot Slater again, is it, totally unreliable</p>
<p>‚ÄìSzabo said this last test, Taliesin, is under internal review by uh, who is it, Philip Quine?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs purely a technical review. We tried out a new detector arrangement. But the old detectors worked fine, they gave us all the data we needed. Actually, Quine‚Äôs been dragging his feet on that report. I‚Äôll have him finish it and get a copy to you, but frankly any problems there are technical and not substantive.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOne last thing. What do you know about uh, Transfinite Polygonics?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat some kind of non-Euclidean geometry? Nuclear chemistry‚Äôs my field.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a holding company, or possibly a consulting firm. Doctor R√©ti seems to own quite a lot of their stock.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd?</p>
<p>‚ÄìCertain technologies licensed through Transfinite originated in the Lab. There might be a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe often waive commercial rights.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, if he‚Äôs advising the government on matters in which he has a financial stake [pg100]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh look, R√©ti‚Äôs no sharpshooter. Some of our people go into private industry, it was probably some former student he wanted to help out, I‚Äôll bet he‚Äôs forgotten all about this stock. Is there anything else?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, that covers it. But the issue of the tests and the alleged overselling. I wouldn‚Äôt take those too lightly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks for coming by, Jeremy.</p>
<p>Highet flipped open his phone, arrowed down until its display showed ROOT DAN, and pressed SEND to hear, ‚ÄìThe Gate Cellular customer you have called is unavailable or has traveled outside the coverage area. Please try your call again later.</p>
<p>The gray face of his watch blinked 3:55. From under the desk he took a black gym bag blazoned aXon, unzipping it for the hand that opened the drawer to transfer An Analysis of False Brightness, as the desk phone trilled and, ‚ÄìHighet. Yes, Bernd. No, that‚Äôs all right‚Ä¶ fingers drumming, he checked his watch for 3:56, and tapped the phone‚Äôs cradle, ‚ÄìHold on, Bernd, that‚Äôs my other line, at once hanging up and passing into the outer office ‚ÄìI‚Äôm gone, Dolores, waving off her ‚ÄìBut the Vice Pres, as rounding a corner behind him a black t-shirt SEROTONIN stopped to watch his back vanish into the warmth of the afternoon sun and pass briskly into the shadow of the unfinished facade, still oddly deserted, past plywood and chainlink where yellow CAUTION CUIDADO tape now stretched taut between stakes around a terrain of ruts and pools of bright green flux.</p>
<p>On a machine of matte black steel and padded vinyl, Highet pumped and pedaled, pale pudgy thighs kissing and releasing the damp seat, and inhaled the stink of his wet clinging shirt. All around him, the creak, clank, huff of exertion, the small of work, the tithe that flesh exacts from mind. Three times a week, since a spell of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tachycardia" title="Wikipedia: tachycardia">tachycardia</a> had scared him to an emergency room, he forced himself through this hour of pain, seething at every pump of calk, every stab of outraged quad. At thirty minutes he quit and went through the lock room, pausing at a fountain to gulp from the weak quavering arc of water brought forth by his thumb on its chrome button, then peeled off sodden t-shirt and shorts for swim briefs, and headed past PLEASE SHOWER BEFORE ENTERING POOL into air cool on his moist flesh and sunlight glinting on black cottonwoods burnishing a golden [pg101] haunch clad in bright spandex, tingling with russet black hair that vanished into a white cap. He freed from his gym bag dropped on a redwood bench a pair of smoked plastic goggles, and sat at pooledge, legs immersed, and rinsed spit from the goggles before fixing them in his orbits, waiting for the white cap to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flipturn" title="Wikipedia: flipturn">flipturn</a> at the wall by his feet before plunging to breaststroke a few lengths behind the scissor of golden legs, the wink of bright spandex.</p>
<p>After ten laps he pushed up out of the water, toweled, brushed fallen cottonwood catkins from the bench, and sat. Nearby a pair of gardeners glanced at him then returned their attention to the trees. ‚Äì¬øPorqu√© los √°lamos no sueltan semillas? ‚ÄìHace dos a√±os rebajamos las hembras. El jefe tiene las al√©gias. ‚Äì¬°Ay! Entonces los hombres √°lamos ya no difrutan mas<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a>. He opened An Analysis Of to <em>beryllium excited by the trigger glowed at precisely the wavelength of the predicted laser light</em>, blinking away from the bright page for his sunglasses, seeing across the pool a thin pale man in blue trunks, suede hat, and hiking boots watch a trim woman passing, his eyes sliding in a lean humorless face. The woman entered the pool and a moment later the thin man removed his boots and hat and lowered into the same lane to swim breaststroke a few lengths behind the woman. Highet called to the lifeguard.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you tell him to move to a slower lane?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe blue suit. He‚Äôs in the way.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLooks fine to me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt tell me! I‚Äôve been sitting here watching him for ten minutes, you haven‚Äôt even been looking.</p>
<p>After a hesitation the guard went to pooledge and thrust a blue kickboard in front of the man as he came to his turn. Highet flipped pages to <em>defective reflectors duplicated and therefore confirmed the brightness predicted by the computer model</em>. Like a child probing a scab he skimmed to <em>throwing all previous test results into question</em>, whispering ‚ÄìFucker, and plunging a hand into the gym bag feeling for the spiral edges, did I get all his copies? Of course not, he‚Äôll have a backup, glancing up to see Quine‚Äôs girl, the one in personnel, talking warmly with a wiry man darkly tanned. What was her name, he‚Äôd looked it up just last week. Should have seen this a few hours ago, [pg102] before dealing with Quine. Drive the knife deeper. A white cap appeared at pooledge and golden arms straightened and a golden leg came up to vault glistening spandex from the lane and russet hair tumbled free from the white cap, cool blue eyes meeting Highet‚Äôs shielded gaze as he shook free of revery, zipped his gym bag and strode back into the dimness of the locker room, sunglasses fogging as he passed the steaming showers, detouring to a row of urinals where he dropped the bag and spraddled tugging aside the crotch of his briefs, staring ahead at tile, as on his cooling back dampness dried and his stream rang in the bowl, misting faintly the hand holding his stub of flesh. On the porcelain shelf was a small uncapped vial. While right thumb and index shook and tucked his flesh into his briefs, he turned the empty vial between index and left thumb, ‚ÄìSon of a, to display URINE LUCK<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> ‚Ä¢ Tersolene ‚Ä¢ Directions: Add contents of the vial to eight ounces (8 oz.) of urine. Mix slightly.</p>
<p>Near chainlink now wrapped with CAUTION CUIDADO, in the shadow of the facade, Bran Nolan, saturnine and gaunt, stood wearing the look of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Voyage%20of%20Bran" title="Wikipedia: The Voyage of Bran">his namesake, son of Febal</a>, upon his return from the magic year of sojourn that spanned mundane centuries, to learn that the shore of home had become fatal to him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìEvening, Bran.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI hear Kihara screwed up the EIS.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the truth.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know what‚Äôs going on here? Nobody‚Äôs working.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs five-thirty, Bran.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNobody‚Äôs been here all afternoon. The caution tape, who put that up?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know. Bran, have a minute? Step inside, would you?</p>
<p>Highet led inside and down the hall, through the empty outer office, kicking aside in passing aXon Tell Us About, gesturing Nolan to a chair near the black matte computer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou put your guests in the death seat, I see.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe back end of your monitor‚Äôs pointed at me. That‚Äôs where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely%20low%20frequency" title="Wikipedia: Extremely low frequency">ELF</a> emissions are highest.</p>
<p>‚ÄìELF, elf is right, that crap‚Äôs about as real as leprechauns. While [pg103] you‚Äôre here, your draft response to this GAO thing, I have a language question, skimming through pages to where a yellow highlight stopped him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhich GAO thing? We‚Äôve got five pending.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe property management one. You say here, ‚Äúsignals an accounting discrepancy‚Äù. Isn‚Äôt that a bit strong?</p>
<p>Nolan put on glasses and studied the page, lips pursed. ‚ÄìOur December statement said, ‚Äúexcellent security management of sensitive materials.‚Äù The same month an internal audit reported ten kilograms of plutonium missing. That signals, you might even say highlights, a discrepancy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSuggests.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSuggests a discrepancy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh no, not at all. An off-record comment in the cafeteria suggests. A heavily edited and reviewed document signals. Or denotes. Or even highlights.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSomething softer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is soft.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSofter.</p>
<p>Nolan crooked a finger. ‚ÄìIndicates. It indicates a discrepancy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs acceptable. Highet moved a pencil across the page. ‚ÄìThank you. What‚Äôs the story on the building.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI heard that Kihara tripped some alarms. I thought I‚Äôd see if they unearthed any bodies out there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know if you remember, but in the planning stage we had two consulting firms prepare environmental reports on that site for us. Chivian-Harris found soil toxicity well above EPA action level</p>
<p>‚ÄìI remember.</p>
<p>‚Äìwhich they blamed on leaky retention tanks and a faulty sewage system. So we call in a second firm, Boole &amp; Clay</p>
<p>‚ÄìEric‚Äôs company</p>
<p>‚Äìcorrect, who suggested cleanup procedures and gave us a more forgiving report on the tanks. So we cited Boole in the EIS. Their findings suggested that the soil could be treated as low-level waste. Then [pg104] the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotechnical%20engineering" title="Wikipedia: Geotechnical engineering">soil engineer</a> reported.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSoil engineer?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBefore the contractor can pour concrete the engineer has to certify that the soil is dense enough to hold a foundation. They use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear%20density%20gauge" title="Wikipedia: Nuclear density gauge">nuclear density testing machine</a>, it‚Äôs a small radioactive source and a counter, like a smoke detector. The design originated here in the Lab. You put soil in the tester and it blocks radiation from the source, and from the absorption you can infer the soil density. Well, the tester went off the scale. Credne, the contractor, came down on the engineer, said his machine was out of alignment, they got him to give a visual approval. Then Credne trucked the soil away, and Chivian tested again and this time we came up clean. So we cited the clean report in the EIS.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo what‚Äôs the problem?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy do you think the tester went off the scale? The soil wasn‚Äôt absorbing, it was emitting radiation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow hot was it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot low level.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere did that soil go?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe don‚Äôt know?</p>
<p>‚ÄìProbably to another Credne site. They have some complicated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leaseback" title="Wikipedia: leaseback">leaseback</a> scheme with a trucking subsidiary. Their records aren‚Äôt so good.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs Credne‚Äôs responsibility, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not a lawyer, I can‚Äôt answer that. Point is, both Boole and Chivian are cited in the EIS. The two reports are on file, anyone can look them up, and if they do, they‚Äôll see the soil engineer‚Äôs readings.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow likely is that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome group like CANT might wonder why Kihara‚Äôs so frantic about his mistake with the map. They might get curious about the paperwork.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs the worst case scenario?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, this isn‚Äôt Site Alpha. We can‚Äôt just fence it off and call it a toxics mitigation program. It‚Äôs in the middle of our plant. Oh, and about Site Alpha. The winemaker‚Äôs been talking to CANT. He‚Äôs suing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChrist, we bought his land, what more does he want? [pg105]</p>
<p>‚ÄìDamages. Loss of livelihood.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShit, thought that was all wrapped up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFunny thing about PR, it bumps into reality once in a while.</p>
<p>‚ÄìKeep telling you, reality‚Äôs what you can get away with. Write him a check, see how fast his reality changes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere does the money come from?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special%20access%20program" title="Wikipedia: Special access program">special access</a> fund, use it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know‚Ä¶ the plume keeps spreading.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat does that mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe toxic plume. Under Site Alpha. It‚Äôs not contained. We can‚Äôt keep buying up land around it.</p>
<p>For a moment the plume was apparent to Highet, clear as a computer simulation, a subterranean cloud of false colors, arms extended, breaching the boundaries of the Lab, which expanded to follow and enclose it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou say CANT is behind this suit?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs what I hear.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI never cease to be amazed, Bran, at how much you hear.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs my job.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou go above and beyond it sometimes. You know, Bran, I tried to get the search committee to promote you instead of that young idiot Kihara.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks for looking out for me. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre better served by Kihara. Journalists can‚Äôt be trusted, everyone knows that.</p>
<p>Highet looked at him. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôre a real hard case, Bran. You won‚Äôt give me an inch.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs there anything else?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake down that caution tape out there.</p>
<p>Outside as the light slanted toward dusk he slowed near the handful of demonstrators just beyond the gate, alert to a camera crew interviewing a woman, her full face radiant in sun, intense black eyes beneath black hair tinged with russet, her beauty a thorn in his heart, lifting his sunglasses as he passed to blink twice at her dazzling flesh, as if to capture not an image but an essence through which desire might be gratified, intimacy possessed, and redemption grasped. As her eyes tracked his passage the head of the reporter turned, and [pg106] Highet accelerated away onto the main road seeing in the hollow afterimage of his blink not an essence but its negative. Traffic thickened into town, and under a white on green sign Mariposa he turned too sharply into the wake of a bus pulling away from the curb to trap him behind its tailpipe and rear placard admonishing Police Recommended Don‚Äôt Park Your Car Without as the traffic above him changed and oncoming vehicles edged honking around his rear until he gunned around the bus before cutting back in and slamming brakes shorts of a truck backing slowly into his path, beeping in disconcerted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hocket" title="Wikipedia: hocket">hocket</a> with Highet‚Äôs horn as he jammed the gearshift to R only to see the bus‚Äôs headlight fill his rearview mirror as the truck‚Äôs step How Am I Driving? 1-800-328-7448 scraped loudly across the red hood.</p>
<p>‚ÄìStop! You son of a bitch stop! It lurched a yard short of his windshield as a head leaned down from the driver‚Äôs cab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere‚Äôd you come from?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust, just, move it, you imbecile! Pull it forward!</p>
<p>In a blast of smoke it pulled away, as he reversed the car, arrested by a blare of bus horn where its glassy eye loomed in his rear window. Shifting to 1, Highet went in a squeal of tires around the truck, left arm held high out the window in profane salute, wind booming through the open window street after street until at last he slowed at First Unitarian Church of Kentwood turning into a parking lot half full, noting with less surprise than disdain the battered white Subaru with Lab sticker on its rear bumper.</p>
<p>Paper signs taped to walls CANT MEETING -&gt; led to a side room FELLOWSHIP HALL depressing as all childhood memories of church, where the after-service klatches in the basement, folding tables laden with cakes and pastries too cloying, smell of burned coffee in chrome urns, fading sun aslant through blinkered windows to fall in exhausted lines on a scuffed linoleum floor, the empty chatter, the waste of time, had never failed to fill him with a metaphysical nausea. Fifty or more people sat now in folding chairs, listening to ‚Äìthe easy availability of dual-use technologies makes it almost impossible to constrain nuclear programs in other countries and raises serious questions, as just inside the door, Quine started back from Highet‚Äôs, ‚ÄìYou. [pg107] What are you doing here?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have a right</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf I find out you‚Äôve been dealing with these people</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat will you do, put me on leave?</p>
<p>Highet stared at him for a moment, then went on around the edge of the room, where, near the platform, a russet tone in nightblack hair snared his eye and sped his heart. The serpent of invention entered him and he stepped up next to her, as if better to hear the speaker, ‚ÄìNext question, yes, and turned to gaze at her strong profile, seeing her awareness of his gaze in the faint throb in her neck. He murmured , ‚ÄìAre you afraid of me? Is it fear makes your heart beat? Or excitement? while beyond her stony profile Quine glared with concern or was it panic as Highet went on in a mild undertone, ‚ÄìAre you afraid of getting what you want? I‚Äôve seen you out by the gate, hating us. Her eyes narrowed but remained locked ahead while Luz said, ‚Äìother countries with or near nuclear capabilities look skeptically at our own commitment to nonproliferation, and across the room Quine paced and glared, his distress a goad to Highet‚Äôs invention. He leaned still closer to her, saying, ‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not fear you feel. It‚Äôs wildness. The wildness of wanting. What is it you want? When you know, taking it is easy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs it, she said, fierce black eyes locking on him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes. Yes it is.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to talk to you sometime.</p>
<p>Now his heart was wild. ‚ÄìName the time.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow? Arms folded under her breasts.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRight now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf you‚Äôre serious. There‚Äôs a caf√© in the central mall, Caf√© Desaparecidos. I can meet you there when I‚Äôm done here. Seven-thirty?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs a deal.</p>
<p>Scattered applause died and people milled around. Tony Luz came forward. ‚ÄìWell, the Prince of Darkness himself. Last place I expected to see you, Leo. What‚Äôs wrong with your face?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNice line of talk, Tony. Won any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clio%20Awards" title="Wikipedia: Clio Awards">Clios</a> lately?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSame old Leo. Smiling, Luz raised a fist and lightly pressed it to Highet‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄìPeople, this is Leo Highet, director of the Lab. I [pg108] feel like I owe him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-time%20rule" title="Wikipedia: Equal-time rule">equal time</a>. How about a little informal Q and A, Leo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMatter of fact I‚Äôve got a plane to catch.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFive minutes. Five minutes, Leo? You don‚Äôt want to run from us, do you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, I do. Most pointless thing in world, arguing with you guys.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFive minutes.</p>
<p>Her hard black eyes studied him. He raised his wristwatch and touched buttons. ‚ÄìFive minutes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy do you classify hazardous waste by the building it‚Äôs stored in? Why not by the program that generates it?</p>
<p>Slogan t-shirt buzzcut three day beard. Cheap shill pumped full of citizengroup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core%20dump" title="Wikipedia: Core dump">coredump</a> data. Answer in kind. ‚ÄìAccounting for materials and wastes is done by building to provide information for emergency response services and to assure that the buildings meet safety requirements.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoesn‚Äôt that just make it easier to hide the fact that the weapons programs generate most of the hazardous waste?</p>
<p>Cocky amateur. Give him what he thinks he wants. ‚ÄìGood point. Maybe we should track that information, but we can‚Äôt. Our procedures are dictated by federal regulations. Talk to the feds about it.</p>
<p>He stopped paying attention, these were just the old neverland arguments he could handle on autopilot, the uninhabitable utopias of good will to brought about by some wishful convergence of niceness, the very word <em>nice</em>, <em><a href="http://wordsmith.org/words/nescient.html">ne scient</a></em>, not knowing, ignorant, he stressed it like a secret insult. ‚ÄìYes, I agree, it would be <em>nice</em>, very nice, if the world could be saved by recycling, and so on, she was at the door now, talking to Quine while Luz asked another question, and Highet parried it with his own, ‚ÄìTony, why are you so down on dual use? Isn‚Äôt that what you want, get us out of weapons?</p>
<p>Luz shifted his weight slightly back, disengaging, as Highet watched Quine and Lynn go out the door together. ‚ÄìDon‚Äôt see that happening, Leo. Dual use policies have weakened export controls on rocket technology, we‚Äôre selling missiles overseas, last year the US accounted for fifty-seven percent of world weapon sales. Some of these systems are being turned back on us. [pg109]</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood thing we know their vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, as long as we keep designing and selling these weapons</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve got that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam%20Hussein" title="Wikipedia: Saddam Hussein">lunatic in Baghdad</a>, you‚Äôve got twenty thousand warheads floating loose in the so-called republics, you think how‚Äôs the time to cut antimissile programs?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs welfare for the defense industry.</p>
<p>‚Äìfree market, what have you got against capitalism, Tony, capitalism‚Äôs been good to you. Drumming the fingers of one hand against the back of the other, trapped by his ego, center of the situation while she moved off without him. He tapped a button on his watch. The watch beeped and he held it high for all to see, touching it to silence, ‚ÄìThat‚Äôs five minutes. Now I have a question for you. Anyone here read H G Wells? The Time Machine? No? You‚Äôre Eloi<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a>. Look it up.</p>
<p>In the lot, Quine‚Äôs white Subaru was gone. he passed SFIST as acceleration spilled warn evening air through the car, cutting back across two lanes to Codornic s EXIT NLY, turning smoothly without slowing past STOP onto a commercial strip that looped behind the central mall, where stains of rain and rust on a colonnaded and pedimented facade stood stark as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melanomas" title="Wikipedia: melanomas">melanomas</a> under sodium light. He parked under the red and white glare of SMART &amp; FINAL, and his car alarm yelped as he strode under a portico through smoked glass doors into the oasis of an atrium ringed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target%20Corporation" title="Wikipedia: Target Corporation">Target</a> <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/17/business/fi-clothestime17">Clothestime</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinko%27s" title="Wikipedia: Kinko‚Äôs">Kinko‚Äôs</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower%20Records" title="Wikipedia: Tower Records">Tower</a>, fixing on Caf√©, where, visible through the broad entrance, black hair with russet tones was bent forward over some papers, the skin of her neck taut against vertebrae, and pale where it touched the fringe of her hair.</p>
<p>Highet sat down, saying, ‚ÄìThought you might have stood me up, leaving that way. With him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe offered me a ride. She swept up the papers and tucked them away.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat does that mean, indicating the sign, ‚Äìdesaparecidos? The caf√© of desperation? Abandon all hope?</p>
<p>‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced%20disappearance" title="Wikipedia: Forced disappearance">The disappeared</a>. Those taken by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death%20squads" title="Wikipedia: death squads">death squads</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, of course. In El Salvador. Or is it Guatemala? Part of the profits from every latt√©. Have you eaten? Thai place around the corner makes great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mee%20krob" title="Wikipedia: mee krob">mee krob</a>. [pg110]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI ate before the meeting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI haven‚Äôt eaten since this morning, I‚Äôm starved.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShe‚Äôs waiting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? Oh, give me a mint tea. And a, what have you got, a blueberry muffin?</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuisiera un espresso por favor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSaw a woman outside the gate this evening, looked like you, talking to CNN.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat was me. I saw you drive by.</p>
<p>He played to her amused tone, examined her critically. ‚ÄìThat was you? Did you cut your hair? How‚Äôd you beat me to the church?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI got a ride. I saw you turn right at Mariposa. That‚Äôs the long way around. You‚Äôve been watching me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìKnow your enemies. Legal observer at CANT demonstrations, Stanford grad, good grades, <em>nice</em> family. You want to close down my Lab. That‚Äôs what I know about you. What do you know about me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know that you sold the president an unworkable and ruinously expensive antimissile program.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, he raised, ruinously expensive for whom?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know that the Cold War has cost five trillion dol</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know what? The Russians wish they had our deficit. They wish they could run up a debt. You follow me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that what you‚Äôre, gracias, what you‚Äôre telling the GAO?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe GAO, right? Talk about your waste of money, as he leaned forward to bite into the muffin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, is that really your line? That you knew all along it wouldn‚Äôt work, but you made the Soviets think it would?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat would be a policy decision. DOE sets policy. I‚Äôm a simple scientist. Not even that, really. I administrate. The science is done by people like your friend Philip. Where do you meet him?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe gave me a ride once.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt own a car. For ecological reasons.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe more you drive the less intelligent you are.</p>
<p>‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo%20Man%20%28film%29" title="Wikipedia: Repo Man (film)">Repo Man</a><a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a>. I love that movie.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wouldn‚Äôt call Philip a friend.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou like him. [pg111]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt dislike him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe tell you he‚Äôs a bomb geek?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs what they call us, the, how should I say, <em>pure</em> scientists who work at the Lab and take our money but want to show that they, you know, disapprove of bombs. They call us bomb geeks. Did Quine tell you he‚Äôs one or did he pretend to be pure?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe told me that he works on weapons. He‚Äôs torn about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTorn. That‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs good to have scruples. Without them we‚Äôre no better than the beasts.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHis work is all he has, and he said to me, you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening there, what I‚Äôm up against right now‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid he. That‚Äôs very interesting. He go into details? Sitting back and smiling, eyes on hers, Highet unzipped his case to take from an upper pocket a sheaf of pages, slyly tipping the pages toward her to reveal in unadorned Courier font ‚ÄúTALIESIN‚Äù RESULTS PRELIMINARY SECRET. ‚ÄìGive you this, maybe? Or this? and like a conjuror fanned to An Analysis of False Brightness, as her full cheeks reddened and a pulse twitched where vein crossed collarbone under downcast eyes, thick lashes, and the fine black hair of her brows.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo. But you have seen them before, he said in a tone almost caressing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat if I have? Dark eyes locked on his.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, well, breaking the gaze, sitting back, still smiling, replacing the sheaf in his case. ‚ÄìIt‚Äôs nothing to me. Old news. Your people talk to Senator Chase‚Äôs office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course we do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìEver convey documents?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat does that mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know Bran Nolan. One of our press officers. He‚Äôs dealt with your group before.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know the name.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe passed these to you. No? Then who? Philip himself?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve got some imagination. Dry voice, but a tremor in it.</p>
<p>Leaning forward, hands clasped around his teacup, sincere gaze. ‚ÄìAll [pg112] I want to know is, how long you‚Äôve had it. And if Chase has it too.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know anything about that.</p>
<p>Hardness biting through her tremor. Standing up to him. His heart sped. ‚ÄìYou know, it‚Äôs not as though your side doesn‚Äôt have enough arguments without resorting to this. It doesn‚Äôt serve your purpose. You shouldn‚Äôt antagonize us, because no wait, now listen to me, because we‚Äôre on the same side, yes we are, and I‚Äôll tell you why. You want the bomb work to stop, and I don‚Äôt agree, but you know what? I can live with that, really I can, so long as we stay cutting edge on other fronts.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs weapons work that gives you your lock on federal money.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs changing. We‚Äôre moving away from that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, that‚Äôs right. Dual use will change everything.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIsn‚Äôt that what you want?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre good at this, I‚Äôm almost believing you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHave some muffin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo thanks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can be persuasive. If you let me. Why don‚Äôt you come around? Let me give you a tour.</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes to sip her espresso. ‚ÄìWhere do you know Tony from?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLuz? We were classmates at Caltech.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt know he went to Caltech.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLousy scientist, but he always could work a crowd. You know he was in advertising?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre still friends?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure, why not. We‚Äôre useful to each other.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, is that what you call friendship? Use?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFriendship. Is that when we all sit around, like, holding hands? I‚Äôd rather have allies. Friends, you know, <em>sympathasize</em> with you. Allies help you get things done. I‚Äôd like to be your ally.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat sounds too lonely for me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, I could be friendlier. But let me ask. Quine, your Philip, you think he hasn‚Äôt used you? To get things done? Think he hasn‚Äôt maneuvered as much as anyone? I could tell you about that shifty little shit. Luz and I, you may wonder at that, but we know what the other is. Quine, though, you never know what he‚Äôs doing. [pg113]</p>
<p>She studied him for a moment. ‚ÄìIn some ways you‚Äôre very like him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLike who?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip.</p>
<p>Which warmed him until he saw the pointed coldness of her eyes. He laughed. ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think so.</p>
<p>In the atrium, a metal gate thundered down beneath Clothestime. Highet regarded her. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôd be quite attractive if you‚Äôd use a little makeup, fix your hair, shave your legs.</p>
<p>She looked away, across the caf√©, smiling and shaking her head. ‚ÄìWhat you‚Äôre doing now, it‚Äôs so‚Ä¶<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìI know, he said, getting to his feet. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôve got me all figured out and it doesn‚Äôt help a bit.</p>
<p>She rose, face darkening. ‚ÄìI do day care. I see this in children, they want to own every situation. I don‚Äôt need this in my adult life.</p>
<p>His heart seethed. ‚ÄìAdult life? You‚Äôre so young. Those kids at your protests, that rebellion doesn‚Äôt age well. You‚Äôll see.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome of those protesters are your age. Or older. There‚Äôs a seventy year old Episcopalian bishop. There‚Äôs a single mother with three children who works forty hours a week then another twenty doing this. They‚Äôre the finest people I know. She opened her purse.</p>
<p>He dropped a bill on the table. ‚ÄìThis is my treat. I insist. Call me if you want that tour.</p>
<p>And went with ballooning heart into the lot, free as the paper bag KFC skipping across asphalt in the warm night wind flattened by his front wheel as the vacant moonless sky trembled unseen past the glare of light poles, a glare that brightened and dimmed, dimmed and brightened as he drove, arousing a frustration that would not be calmed, an urge that could not be channeled, a lust to abase himself before her and thus abase her, until, cued by the car‚Äôs approach, lights snapped on over the garage and the door rolled open. He stilled, shut, and locked the car, red light blinking on the dash under teal 8:45, garage door rumbling shut as he entered through the kitchen silencing the alarm‚Äôs squeal with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" title="Wikipedia: Pi">3 1 4 1 6</a> as the light went from red ARMED to green SAFE, passing and ignoring the blinking MESSAGES on his answering machine, as kitchen lights came on for him [pg114] to lean against the open refrigerator door, drumming fingers, stooping to come up with a greasy box PapaGeno Pizza, punching the microwave START and plucking from between Fines Herbes and Italian Seasoning a small bottle LactAid, shaking out two pills and swallowing them with Peach Iced Tea from a cold and glistening can while thumbing the small television where CNN drew a baleful glare for ‚Äìongoing probe of Radiance missile defense program, and the oven chimed and the phone trilled. He turned off the phone and zeroed the answering machine‚Äôs volume, touching the CD player for ‚Äìgot a kindhearted woman do anything in the world for me<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a>, and crossed back for his pizza, steaming and succulent, pausing to jab his thumb against ant after ant streaming across the counter in braided lines, then carried plate to table and as he ate skimmed the newspaper, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill" title="Wikipedia: Exxon Valdez oil spill">Exxon To Pay Fine</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi%20no-fly%20zones" title="Wikipedia: Iraqi no-fly zones">US Steps Up Iraq Air Patrols</a>, State Budget Shortfall, Why Gate Cellular Is Forging Alliances, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland%20Athletics" title="Wikipedia: Oakland Athletics">A‚Äôs</a> Shine In Training, the edges of the newsprint soaking up a smear of grease from his fingers as the pizza diminished, his eyes at last drifting to 24 HRS OUTCALL above a sullen pout and forehead circleted with dark hair wild as if fresh risen from the sea, and he unfolded the phone, clearing his throat, for ‚ÄìLombard Escorts, while Robert Johnson sang on forlorn in the empty living room against the rush of a shower, interrupted by the chime and the quick stride of muscled calves beneath a belted robe opening to, ‚ÄìHi, I‚Äôm Dawna, running a hand through hair not dark or wild but bright as a carrot under the porch light, beyond which a sky as empty of stars as of folly, error, sin, and avarice turned through empty hours carrying a sliver of waning moon, thin as a nail paring, in pursuit of Venus through a brightening sky in flight from the sun rising to flood the bedroom deck with morning light on slim white legs stretched from red satin briefs barely covered by the fall of a translucent shift.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you mind? Highet called out. ‚ÄìI have neighbors.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt we all, honey, as she came in sliding the door shut behind her, taking from between his outstretched fingers three tightly folded bills. She sat on the bed and pulled on hose. He stepped into the bathroom to dress. When he emerged she was picking hairs from her brush and dropping them into a waste can. The brush went into her bag with [pg115] a snap and she smiled brightly at Highet as she turned and went out.</p>
<p>As he shut the front door behind her, he saw the light on the answering machine. He pressed PLAY for, ‚ÄìLeo, it‚Äôs Dan, some son of a bitch hacked my cell phone, and walked to the sink where he jammed the lever to blast hot water across a tide of ants twined from the pizza crust lodged in the sink drain across counter and linoleum to a garbage pail, returning to, ‚Äìran up eight thou in calls to Bogot√°, new number‚Äôs 326-7668, give me a, pausing the machine to punch the seven digits.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDan, it‚Äôs me. Yeah, doesn‚Äôt say much for Gate‚Äôs security, does it. What? Chase? That son of a bitch, what‚Äôs he trying to. My performance review committee? as steam billowed from the sink. ‚ÄìOkay, give me the rundown. Dullard Quack and Logjam, they‚Äôre on our side‚Ä¶ what? Well that‚Äôs Quick‚Äôs own fault, if he hadn‚Äôt been a year late and ten million over with the last mainframe we ordered he‚Äôd still have the contract, now what‚Äôs Logue‚Äôs problem? Well again, that‚Äôs his, if he hadn‚Äôt talked to the press, I told him you cannot win playing with the press, you‚Äôre always going to lose. Okay. Okay, Dan, cut to the, what do you mean probably? You mean Dillard‚Äôs our only sure vote? How can that be? What, tomorrow? They‚Äôre meeting on a Sunday? Christ, as if I didn‚Äôt have enough‚Ä¶ Why. Why should I. No I don‚Äôt see what being there in the flesh does for me. It‚Äôs only a recommendation, what do the regents care, the university gets their money no matter who‚Äôs director. What do you mean cuts both, of course it does, but we have enough friends on the regents to override, don‚Äôt we? A new regent, what do you mean, who? A noname, oh that‚Äôs great, little bit of Monte Carlo in the mix. What else, Dan? shutting off the hot water and walking to the window.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChrist Dan that was years ago, I was still out in the trailers. And if you want to know whose bright idea it was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative%23Homing%20Overlay%20Experiment%20%28HOE%29" title="Wikipedia: Strategic Defense Initiative#Homing Overlay Experiment (HOE)">rig a homing beacon on the missile‚Äôs target</a>, ask Warren Slater, that prick. Anyway, you know what? The only test of four that worked was the one they didn‚Äôt rig.</p>
<p>Outside a city truck moved slowly past as two men in its bed deposited TOW-AWAY NO PARKING placards at the curb.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat else. Who‚Ä¶ oh come on, Steradian couldn‚Äôt find his dick [pg116] if you held it for him. Yes he called me, he called Dietz too, forget it, he‚Äôs fishing.</p>
<p>He flipped yellow pages for Exterminators stopping at a display ad, Nekrotek 24 Hour Pest Control.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDan, Bill Venham<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> is a troglodyte. Yes I know, rich and powerful, so‚Äôs the vice president, I don‚Äôt return his calls either. What? Oh he calls because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal%20Bush" title="Wikipedia: Neal Bush">his son</a> went into some telecom venture after that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings%20and%20loan%20crisis" title="Wikipedia: Savings and loan crisis">savings and loan thing</a>, maybe he‚Äôs trying to weasel in on our Gate deal. But Venham, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to his fucking fundraiser. I know R√©ti‚Äôs going, ask me it‚Äôs pathetic how he hangs around these rightwing creeps. Oh yeah, you know how long I‚Äôve been just showing up at these things. Uh huh. Uh huh. All right, Dan. I said all right, I‚Äôll do it! That, and the review committee on Sunday, quite the itinerary you‚Äôve got lined up for me. What about the Hertz kids, does that have to be Sunday night? Oh, the shot, of course, I forgot. Yes I‚Äôll make it. One of the few things I still enjoy. I‚Äôll be exhausted but I‚Äôll be there.</p>
<p>Reading and punching digits for, ‚ÄìNekrotek, he gave his name and address, jabbing his thumb against ant after ant braiding onward across the counter, ‚ÄìAnts, yes. Well look, I‚Äôm leaving town can you fax me the paperwork? I‚Äôll sign it and leave it with a key in the mailbox, okay? Yes you‚Äôll take a credit card‚Ä¶? and hung up, turning to the answering machine MESSAGES and touching &gt;&gt; for a beep and ‚Äìtor Highet, this is Armand Steradian of CNN. I‚Äôd like to talk to you as soon as possible. I‚Äôm finishing a story on allegations of rigged tests in the Radiance program, my number is ‚ÄìFuck you, and touching &gt;&gt; for the beep and ‚ÄìFrank Greer returning your, ‚Äìcan‚Äôt believe this twerp calls me at home, and touching &gt;&gt; for the beep and ‚ÄìYork Times, if you‚Äôd care to comment, then leaning in to read the display, ‚Äìfifteen messages! punching &gt;&gt; for ‚Äìalleged violations, and &gt;&gt;, ‚Äìquestions about your environmental impact statem, and &gt;&gt; ‚Äìcall at your earliest, and finally STOP for a peremptory knock at the door sounding with the chime. For a moment he stood frozen, then walked lightly to the bedroom. From its window he saw in the street a van bearing a dish antenna. The bell and knock sounded again. After a third try, two men, one shouldering a video camera, returned to the van. [pg117]</p>
<p>From the closet he took a garment bag and checked its contents: his impression-management suit, a tie, two clean shirts, socks, a pair of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockport%20%28company%29" title="Wikipedia: Rockport (company)">Rockports</a>, a personal kit. Again he lifted the phone. His left eyelid began to twitch. Phon in hand he pressed a finger against it. With the other hand he punched 276-7384. Behind him his fax machine purred.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron, it‚Äôs Leo. I need your help. Please call me. It‚Äôs urgent. I hope to see you tonight in Burbank at the Venham dinner. I‚Äôll be on the road till then, you can reach me by cell phone at 544-4438.</p>
<p>Outside, the van had gone. Pages had fallen on the floor behind him. He picked them up and scribbled his signature. He zipped his laptop computer into its nylon carry. From the dresser he took a spare house key and five hundred dollar bills. At the front door he checked the fisheye lens for an empty street before swinging it wide and dropping the spare key and the faxes into the mailbox. On the way back through the kitchen to the garage he unplugged the answering machine and again picked up the phone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThea, it‚Äôs me, looks like I can shake some time loose after all. When is mother getting home? Uh huh. No, if I leave right away I can be there in. No, not a problem. I can take care of some other business at the same. I‚Äôll be glad to see her too. Okay, look, don‚Äôt go to any trouble. See you about three.</p>
<p>The garment bag fell on the passenger seat as the garage door rumbled open, and he was on his way.</p>
<p>The dead seabed, the broad valley, sundered the state top to bottom. Speed Enforced By Aircraft. Power lines fell and rose in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catenaries" title="Wikipedia: catenaries">catenaries</a> to cross the road‚Äôs dead places as a crescendo buzz rose to bury ‚Äìwouldn‚Äôt stand a prayer, and fell away behind, ‚Äìhere we are in the quick of it, as the radio scanned to ‚Äìanother anointed message from the Reveal Christ To The World Ministries<a href="#fn64" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a>, to ‚Äìwith significant tax deferral benefits, to ‚Äìthis, also from the Washington Times, to ‚ÄìInland Empire checks in accident free, to ‚ÄìJesus was never impressed with size, the size of your organ, as the sun reached zenith and declined glinting on the lake at Elev 4819 where he turned off the freeway to descend into tender green hills and an orange dust of poppies blooming, and silver violet sage trembling palely in the relentless wind, leading the eye out over an immensity to distant mountains naked and wrinkled as ancient [pg118] skin. From above fell a hollow roar. Two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop%20Grumman%20B-2%20Spirit" title="Wikipedia: Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit">blunt black triangles</a> banked against blue emptiness.</p>
<p>Tumbling from the edge of his vision something dim and gray crossed the road and splintering tinder sheared from the windshield as the tail of the car shimmied and stabilized with one branch of the tumbleweed lodged in the hood trembling in the slipstream. His heart slowed and his attention came back to the road where the works of man now came more thickly, Joshua Estates blazoned over a brick drive flanked by banners snapping and New Townhouses From $59,999 We‚Äôre Leasing Come See Why, Spacious Skies Senior Living Small Pets OK, then City Limit Elev 2376 and a grid of vacant dirt roads, W 280 ave W 270 Ave W 260 Ave, then mini malls and LANCASTER FACTORY STORES, identical red tile roofs and beige walls and empty parking lots reproving the immensity in which they lay.</p>
<p>The house, once at desert‚Äôs edge, was now deep in a tract of others like it. Locust trees shaded the street, their roots heaving the sidewalk. Forty years ago the saplings were slender and staked, no taller than himself. His eyes and mind, inapt tenants of time, still expected to find them thus, continued to seek in a place, a face, what first they had found there.</p>
<p>Sun glared on the concrete walk. He was sweating before he reached the house. No answer to the bell. Neighborhood Watch Armed Response. Key under the rock as it had been for years. The unlocked door stuck until he thrust his weight against it.</p>
<p>Stale air of home. Anxiety of passing time. This place he had always wanted to escape. On the bare dining room table lay a note. He read it, then lifted the phone and dialed. Through the handset came unanswered chirrs. As he counted them, Thea‚Äôs car pulled into the driveway. Her key turned in the lock. The door stuck, then flew wide.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, you‚Äôre here.</p>
<p>In one hand Highet held out the chirring handset, in the other her note. ‚ÄìYour answering machine‚Äôs turned off. I don‚Äôt believe this Thea, you couldn‚Äôt have called me? When did you find out?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey want to do just one more series of tests before they release her.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGreat. Just great. I‚Äôm going home. [pg119]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, Leo‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs absurd.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not waiting around in this house.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you go into town for a while? You know, your high school reunion‚Äôs tonight.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy what? Is this one of your airball agendas, Thea? If I need that level of excitement I‚Äôll sit in a Motel Six and watch the Weather Channel.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, do what you want, you always do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve got that right.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have to be sure everything‚Äôs ready. I still need an IV stand, to hang a drip from. I‚Äôm sure we can rig something up, it just has to be tall.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRig something. Sure, I know, let‚Äôs use the coat rack. Dress it up with some Christmas lights, a little tinsel, there you are.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, don‚Äôt be sarcastic.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll buy the damn thing, okay? Where‚Äôs the store, give me something to do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe hospital gave me some addresses. There‚Äôs one in Pasadena.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPerfect, I‚Äôll stop in at Caltech on my way to the high school, make a clean sweep.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, is there a Caltech reunion?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJoking, Thea, just a little joke, checking his watch, ‚ÄìHow late is this place open?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, it‚Äôs all the way in Pasadena!</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll leave now. Make sure the hospital gets their kickback from the referral. Got to go down that way anyway for</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve just driven seven hours. You</p>
<p>‚ÄìFive hours.</p>
<p>‚Äìmust be exhausted, Mark and I will stop on the way back from the hospital with Mother.</p>
<p>‚ÄìStop on the, yeah good, let Mother sit in the back seat staring at the crutches and bedpans in the window while you shop around. Come on Thea, there‚Äôs got to be someplace nearby, where‚Äôs the phone book.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, will you just, just stop it!</p>
<p>‚ÄìThea, you‚Äôre the one wants everything ready, only you want to do it on the cheap at the last minute, like always, you‚Äôve had, what, six [pg120] weeks to get this stuff, you knew you‚Äôd need it</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you think you can come down here for a few days while I‚Äôve been dealing with this for months, and you think</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho said anything about a few days.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI never said a few days.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow long are you going to stay?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTold you, expected Mother to be here already, thought I‚Äôd stay overnight, hit the road in the morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, I see. I get it. You want to buy your way out of spending any time with her.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBuy my way, Jesus, Thea, who‚Äôs paying the hospital bills? ‚ÄìMother‚Äôs Medica</p>
<p>‚ÄìI mean the rest of it, after the deductibles and everything Doctor Said won‚Äôt accept assignment for, you know how much that comes to? Buy my way, Christ that‚Äôs good, not with a lousy IV stand, if she had to rely on you for money, she‚Äôd be dead already.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh that‚Äôs rotten Leo, I don‚Äôt care about the money, she needs to see you, did you think of her feelings, it may be the last time, did you think of that!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell you‚Äôre the expert on feelings, I can‚Äôt compete there.</p>
<p>She looked at him dully, then rummaged in a gray woven carryall blazoned with a cross-stitched mandala. ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know why I thought this time would be any different.</p>
<p>He looked away, around the room. ‚ÄìHow‚Äôs business? Sell any houses recently?</p>
<p>She stared into space for some seconds before reaching, as it seemed, less an acceptance of his question than a resignation to it. ‚ÄìThe market‚Äôs flat. I got into it at the wrong time, at the end of the last boomlet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUpholding the Highet real estate tradition. Ever sell that land of Dad‚Äôs?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs the house worth now?</p>
<p>She looked around, appraising it. ‚ÄìI could ask one fifty, I might get one thirty.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou going to sell? [pg121]</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean after Mother? I suppose so. I haven‚Äôt really thought about it. Oh, I wanted to ask you. The market‚Äôs better in your area. How would you feel about me moving up there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìUp to you. Where are you looking?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOhlone Valley. There‚Äôs a development called Estancia Estates, units starting at one fifty‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìEstancia‚Ä¶? I wouldn‚Äôt live there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy not?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou can do better.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFor two hundred I could, but I don‚Äôt have it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAny time you want a loan, Thea.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt would be a business move for me. I have no reason to stay here once Mother‚Äôs gone. Without Bob. Mark has his family, I don‚Äôt see much of him. Leo, whatever happened to that girl you were seeing last year, Jan? I liked her, I thought she was good for you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs over.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you seeing anyone now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, what‚Äôs her name?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDawn. Her name‚Äôs Dawn.</p>
<p>She looked at him skeptically. ‚ÄìAre you thinking of settling down?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMarried to my job, you know that. How‚Äôs Mark?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôll see him tonight. I thought we‚Äôd all have dinner at my place.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLittle problem there, I‚Äôve got something this evening.</p>
<p>She stopped in her rummaging, looked at him bitterly. ‚ÄìCan‚Äôt you, can‚Äôt you ever</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, I‚Äôd rather not go to this thing, it‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚Äìever just</p>
<p>‚Äìone of those things</p>
<p>‚Äìdo anything for someone else</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs to honor R√©ti, told you I‚Äôm obligated</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, this is your mother!</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm here, all right? When I said I‚Äôd be! Don‚Äôt lay this on me Thea, it‚Äôs not my fault you got your signals crossed.</p>
<p>Abruptly she rose. ‚ÄìAll right. I don‚Äôt want to discuss it. Here‚Äôs the key. [pg122]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen are you leaving for the hospital?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow. We should be back by eight.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChrist, how did she end up at a hospital two hours down below?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, you know how she trusts Doctor Said. He recommended a man at Cedars.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt want to be, you know, unfeeling here, but it‚Äôs terminal isn‚Äôt it, how good does he have to be.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, I‚Äôm going. There are towels in the guest room.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll be back tonight. Will Mother be here?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI expect so. I‚Äôll see you in the morning.</p>
<p>The front door shut, grunting. He flipped through the phone book. Antelope Valley Medical Supply. Medi-Mart. Mid-Valley Surgical. Free delivery. Typical Thea, didn‚Äôt even look. He picked one, wandering into the kitchen as he talked, ‚ÄìExpires six ninety three. Can you hold delivery till nine p m?</p>
<p>The clock on the stove was broken, hands frozen at 2:10, though a stub of a second hand ground and scraped on. Outside the kitchen window the old fig tree nodded in the wind. On the table was a newspaper. He unfolded it to AF Base Has Clouds With Its Silver Lining and its sidebar Cold War Relics, then put it aside. From the living room he carried garment bag and laptop to the guest room, past the sampler hanging in the hall, Bless This House O Lord We Pray, pulling back the drapes to see the long view of his childhood, the distant ancient mountains, now enchased by hedges, fences, light poles, power lines, returning to the living room where he snapped on the television in passing to his mother‚Äôs room. A new chrome walker stood by the bed. Back in the living room he punched channels to ‚ÄìHeadline News, and stood watching, the fingers of one hand drumming against a thigh, one foot tapping. After several minutes he switched it off.</p>
<p>At the end of the hall he went down six steps to the basement study, where a dispiriting smell of mildew hung. He sat at the small desk with its brass lamp and blotter, the framed photos of his mother and father, Thea, Mark, himself, Dad in uniform, Dad between two high school players in his sweatshirt LANCASTER COACH BOMBERS. Shelves of teak veneer sagging on metal wall brackets held what [p123] passed for a library with ten years‚Äô worth of National Geographic propped against Patent It Yourself, Encyclopedia of Estate Planning, The Book of Business Knowledge, Secrets of Super Selling, Everyday Health Tips 2000 Practical Tips, and How To Avoid Probate! abutting the fifteen brown volumes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton%27s%20Encyclopedia" title="Wikipedia: Compton's Encyclopedia">Compton‚Äôs Pictured Encyclopedia</a>, their gilt bands touching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck%20Manual%20of%20Diagnosis%20and%20Therapy" title="Wikipedia: Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy">The Merck Manual</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartlett%27s%20Familiar%20Quotations" title="Wikipedia: Bartlett‚Äôs Familiar Quotations">Bartlett‚Äôs Familiar Quotations</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20World%20Set%20Free" title="Wikipedia: The World Set Free">The World Set Free</a> slanted against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Martian%20Chronicles" title="Wikipedia: The Martian Chronicles">The Martian Chronicles</a> and the sober dun bookcloth of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20Third%20Reich" title="Wikipedia: The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</a> and Lancaster High School 1960 1961 1962, the sequence ending as abruptly as Gerald Hunter Highet‚Äôs career there. He took down 1962, blowing soot from its top edge. A strip of paper marked a page. On the trip, his mother‚Äôs looping hand: <em>sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely night</em>.</p>
<p>Tenor voice on the phonograph. Mom and Dad dancing. Leo darling, your father and I have been married ten years. Dad smiling. Not a smiling man, but a collector of jokes. Son, you know what a ball bearing mousetrap is? Leo tried to picture the mechanism. It‚Äôs a cat, son. The lined face, graying crewcut, bleak eyes, tight mouth, jowls under the square jaw. Jerry to some friends, Hunt to others, Captain (ret.) to the rest, depending on how they‚Äôd met. Petty hustlers, most of them, from his Army days, his years at Lockheed, his bootless dabbling in real estate. Then the high school for three years, chemistry and coaching. Until the scandal. Nothing proved. What do you think I am? I never touched a one of them. It‚Äôs political, the superintendent has it in for me. Left under a shadow, as they said. Then failure after failure. The real estate. The orchards. The telemarketing. His run for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selectman" title="Wikipedia: selectman">selectman</a> drew a visit from the local Republican officials: best for all concerned that you withdraw. But you wouldn‚Äôt. Leo had been proud then of his father‚Äôs stubbornness. Later he saw it was desperation. A debacle: thirty votes out of three thousand cast. Then the cancer.</p>
<p>From the marked page Leo‚Äôs photo at age sixteen looked warily out over Math Club, Science Club, Chess Club, Honor Society. Young gawky prig thinks he‚Äôs on his way to a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>On the opposite page was Chazz Hollis, his best friend. Curly blond hair, open smile. Orchestra, Band, Swim Team, Track, Language Club[pg124], <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%20Club" title="Wikipedia: Key Club">Key Club</a>. Summer days in Chazz‚Äôs cool basement. Leo used his father‚Äôs keys to swipe chemicals from the high school lab. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash%20powder" title="Wikipedia: Flash powder">Potassium nitrate, aluminum, sulfur</a>. Outside the sun bleached, the hot wind scoured the world. They bicycled to the edge of town to set off bombs, out where tank tracks remained from Patton‚Äôs army training to fight Rommel. Or they drove out to Edwards to watch pilots rack up flight time with touch-and-go landings. Once in a while something secret would be tested. If somebody‚Äôs father was involved in the project, you might hear about it. One night he and Chazz drove on dirt roads to the eroded hills behind the rocket lab. They lay on their bellies overlooking tarmac where a rocket engine on its side thundered and spewed flame, a hard white fountain that filled the night with noise, light, power.</p>
<p>Spring hike through Death Valley with a dozen other boys. His father‚Äôs idea. Toughen you up. Chazz is going, you like Chazz. Unspoken was the expense, nothing to Chazz‚Äôs family, to theirs a sacrifice. So he went. Hating every minute and hiding it. Bone tired every night, always the last one into camp. Weak boy, can‚Äôt hike, can‚Äôt climb. Nights dark as the void, desert sky lustrous with stars, meteors, and the occasional wanderer, Sputnik could it be? Even Chazz mocked him, best friend Chazz, golden Chazz, whose father was a state senator, Chazz who never worked for anything, who always had a new bike, new microscope, new drum set, new radio, new girlfriend. That day on the cliff, twelve of them shouting and climbing, Leo last, fifty feet from the ground, ten feet from the top, suddenly empty and weak, rock biting his palms. Chazz leaning over the edge, tongue out, dribbling spit on him. Being beaten, being second, being mocked. Never again. He clapped shut the book and reshelved it.</p>
<p>In the shower he prodded with blunt fingers the roll of fat at his hips. Soaping under his arms he probed lymph glands. Wiping mist from the mirror he leaned to examine his broad nose, the creases around his eyes, the stubble sprouting more white than black, the nascent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dewlap" title="Wikipedia: dewlap">dewlap</a>, the thinning hair. His swollen cheek had subsided, leaving only a slight puffiness. He shaved. In the guest room he unzipped the garment bag, thinking ahead to his drive, the 14 to the 5, low sun in his eyes, an hour if traffic didn‚Äôt thicken through the valley. Waste [pg125] of time, this whole weekend. Never mind. Just show up. In the hall mirror, behind sunglasses, was no trace of the young gawky prig but a sober harried face in late middle age, its sourness fixed by habits of mistrust and anger and just showing up.</p>
<p>The sun was setting. A/C MIN, he lowered windows for the spill of cool air as the car crested the pass above the lights of San Fernando, a splendor as intricate and baffling as the brain‚Äôs net of cells, as brighter stars rose to break free of the net and bank in the air above HOLLYWOOD-BURBANK AIRPORT where he turned at Convention Center into a knot of cars waiting for Valet Parking behind a familiar white Mercedes NKB3 just pulling away as under the awning an elderly figure, limping, was escorted inside where Highet, a few minutes later, followed, past MULTIMEDIA EXPO to a smaller ballroom ARETE FOUNDATION<a href="#fn65" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Tonight Guest Speakers Tuck Eubanks Dr Aron R√©ti and a concentrated display of wealth sapient of little but itself, object of its own desire and scion of its own begetting, demurely awaiting some intelligence to possess and shape it, to cherish and obey it, and finding no lack of supplicants: media consultants between jobs, econ postdocs, freelance historians, sociologists, engineers, futurists, grant writers, lobbyists, intellectual property lawyers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/direct%20mail" title="Wikipedia: direct mail">direct mail</a> wizards, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political%20action%20committee" title="Wikipedia: Political action committee">PAC</a> men, Ponzi schemers, and free market ideologues who, like the pious of an earlier age, would have been horrified equally at having their faith doubted or at seeing it practiced, producers and providers and panders of one content or another, aspirants to this bridal altar, charged with an excitement sexual but not carnal in the face of such dumb bounty, eager to court and preen and fawn and possess and find themselves, in turn, possessed until in this happy consummation it could not be told who was using whom or even that use could be separate from being.</p>
<p>In tailored pinstripe, at the center of a captivated group, an obese and blustering figure held forth in orotund tones with an animation that danced between belligerence and deference, choler and comity, feinting aggressively then falling back in submissive attention to the flattered figures of the vice president, eyes dull as his lusterless blue suit, William Venham in black mohair, and, a little apart from them, Aron R√©ti, wizened and rumpled as exiled aristocracy, wearing on his [pg126] ravaged features a thin forbearing smile that might have masked a displeasure not with hierarchy itself but with its current occupants.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy friends, I understand the President, I truly do. I had an encounter with him that was really profound on me. He‚Äôs a good guy but he just doesn‚Äôt <em>get</em> it about taxes that it‚Äôs <em>your money</em>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>With his ear for public affect, Highet judged Eubank‚Äôs voice so near to excellent that its lapses, at least those that were not calculated, offended. Vulgarity and laziness mixed in its upper reaches, where an ugly hard resentment was slurred with venality and easy contempt. Groomed ferret on a leash. Sucking up to the vice president.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat we truly need in this coming election is a truly conservative candidate, a man like yourself, sir‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Highet approached R√©ti, only to be caught by an arm in black mohair. ‚ÄìWe-hell! The man himself!</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen Bill, give me a minute with Aron would you, I need t</p>
<p>‚ÄìBad time, Leo, our guest of honor‚Äôs pretty busy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is important.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMan‚Äôs pleading your case to the vice president and the assembled masses, what could be more important?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy, pleading my what? turning quickly as from behind him came R√©ti‚Äôs voice, rumbling and deliberate. Off balance, he bumped the man behind him, who put hands out to steady him. It was Orrin Gate. Gate‚Äôs mild face showed only mild concern, unless that faint smile hid more than recognition. But Gate had come from a blind spot off his radar. Here in the very lap of power and influence, where he needed to be alive to every current, he was missing cues. He glared malevolently at Eubanks, still at the center of the group but silent at last, small eyes glittering in the piggish face, while R√©ti in his oracular mode stood leaning on his cane. The vice president listened, mouth slightly agape.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo I ask you. We deploy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104%20Patriot" title="Wikipedia: MIM-104 Patriot">Patriot missiles</a> to defend Tel Aviv. Should we not so protect our own borders?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I can‚Äôt, ah, speak for the president, but I would think, that we, that is, it does look like something, ah, we would want to look at‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI am certain that the president understands the importance of missile defense. But he must <em>express</em> that support! With conviction! [pg127]</p>
<p>While, frustrated at the attention withdrawn from him, the obese figure again struck its orotund tones, so familiar to so many whose pursuit of truth stopped at the nearest radio. ‚ÄìHe‚Äôs right! Folks, the reason conservatives are winning is that moderates don‚Äôt have conviction. If you ask people what‚Äôs wrong with the president they‚Äôll say he isn‚Äôt convicted!</p>
<p>Highet turned to Venham, who was, he saw now, observing him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour case, is it? Venham‚Äôs eyes glittered.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou said that, Bill, not me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI meant that Aron‚Äôs arguing the Lab‚Äôs case.</p>
<p>‚Äìbecause I think the president discredit himself when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%20my%20lips%3A%20no%20new%20taxes" title="Wikipedia: Read my lips: no new taxes">he raised taxes after he promised</a></p>
<p>‚ÄìBill, I need to talk to you about this regents‚Äô meeting coming up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot now, Leo, too much happening.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHello, it‚Äôs Doctor Hite, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, you know Stan Flack? Stan, Leo Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure, we‚Äôve met, hello Doct</p>
<p>Venham leaned in, lowering his voice to confide, ‚ÄìYou worried about regents, Leo, Stan‚Äôs the man to talk to.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh? But, you must be the new reg, turning, off balance again, to take the extended hand, which vigorously pumped his, ‚Äìsorry, missed your name</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron! let‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚ÄìFlack, Stan Flack. Won‚Äôt you join me at my table, Doctor Hite?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, sure, just let me, freeing my hand, ‚ÄìAron! as the elder scientist‚Äôs ice blue eyes fixed on him briefly then returned to Eubanks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCatch us later Leo, said Venham as the vice president and R√©ti joined in Eubanks‚Äôs professional laughter. ‚ÄìGot to get things rolling here.</p>
<p>A snub? He‚Äôd never. Like a son to him. Get a few minutes with him later. Meanwhile the regent went forward through a press of people, Highet a few steps behind, dodging past, ‚Äìdestroy America without firing a shot, and ‚Äìno injustice, their external circumstances fit their level of development, and ‚Äìsell them all to private operators, while a nasal voice cut through, ‚Äìsteal a man‚Äôs style, about the lowest, and Highet turned to [pg128] faced the back of a scuffed brown leather jacket lined with a red silk scarf nestled under curly blond hair past which a stunning woman in a white silk blouse said, ‚ÄìChazz, I think he considers it homage, ‚ÄìHomage? Maybe he‚Äôd like to come rob my house, call that homage too, the nasal voice lost under, ‚Äìjust love Tuck‚Äôs show, all his, his down home spunnisms, and ‚ÄìHere we are Doctor Hite, won‚Äôt you sit here? ushered by the eager voice to a table at the far edge of things where a querulous old man in a wheelchair was soothed and settled at table by an attendant to the glares of a chubby young man whose lapels bore one a gold cross and the other an enamel pin of Old Glory, as does ‚Äìdees n jelmen, burst from a podium hung with a banner azure partitioned by the chevron of mountain peak over the legend ·ºÄœÅŒµœÑŒµ encircled by the motto SCIENCE LIBERTY COMMERCE. A klaxon of feedback swelled and warbled before it damped back to, ‚Äìtention please.</p>
<p>‚Äìso glad I ran into you Doctor Hite, we need to talk</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes we do, about this upcoming regents‚Äô meeting</p>
<p>‚Äìbecause my people are ready to move on this multiplication thing</p>
<p>‚Äìpleased to have with us tonight</p>
<p>‚Äì‚Ä¶multiplication‚Ä¶?</p>

<p>‚ÄìWait a minute. Aren‚Äôt you the new UC regent?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, we met</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre not a regent?</p>
<p>‚Äìout at Bill‚Äôs ranch a while back, drowned by applause rising to meet the obese figure ascending to the podium, as Highet muttered, ‚ÄìThat lying sack of</p>
<p>‚ÄìThank <em>yew</em>! You know my friends, this is a thrill for me, because my whole life I‚Äôve always tried to meet people who are the best at what they do</p>
<p>‚Äìmay remember, Doctor Hite, that we had established a priority claim for the operation of multiplication</p>
<p>‚Äìah, you‚Äôre the, yes, I remember you now</p>
<p>‚Äìpeople whose energy and entrepreneurism and inspiration define [pg129] America, with the ideas that are inspirational on American life</p>
<p>‚Äìknow this guy, came the querulous voice, used to insult people on the radio in Sacramento</p>
<p>‚Äìinspiring people to be more than they can be</p>
<p>‚Äìhey do you mind, I‚Äôm trying to listen to Tuck</p>
<p>‚Äìin the free marketplace of ideas, my friends, where the truth always wills out</p>
<p>‚Äìhard to believe a mind that small has a mouth that big</p>
<p>‚Äìideas like family, excellence, competition, and self-reliance</p>

<p>‚Äìwill you, just</p>

<p>‚Äìway things <em>ought</em> to be, because people are at their best when they look out for themselves</p>

<p>‚Äìlook</p>
<p>‚Äìfolks, I was just talking with our brilliant guest of honor Doctor R√©ti, the father of the</p>
<p>‚Äìprior art consisting of al-Qarizmi‚Äôs book</p>
<p>‚Äìbut this is simple, you don‚Äôt need to be a genius. Let‚Äôs put the dots together. Missile defense is not rocket scientology</p>
<p>‚Äìwhere‚Äôs the food</p>
<p>‚Äìit‚Äôs not E M C equals, it‚Äôs not time travel</p>
<p>‚Äìexpressing the multiplication operation as</p>

<p>‚Äìask a man to dinner, feed him malapropisms</p>
<p>‚Äìjust good sense that we need to be competitive in this arena</p>
<p>A young waiter, goateed and smug, came round Highet‚Äôs right holding a tray. ‚ÄìDo you want the chicken <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccata" title="Wikipedia: Piccata">peccata</a><a href="#fn66" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman%20Rushdie" title="Wikipedia: Salman Rushdie">salmon rushdie</a>? [pg130]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll have the chicken.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood, we‚Äôre out of the salmon.</p>
<p>‚Äìsoul of brevity my friends and as Shakespeare said, brevity is the soul of wit. That means, the least amount of words you take to say something, equals the more power that it will have. So without further</p>
<p>‚Äìdon‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening to the Grand Old Party, these rude young upstarts, religious fanatics</p>
<p>‚Äìand finally thank you for inciting I mean inviting me to host a pogrom with so many prestidigious names. Our first speaker</p>
<p>‚Äìso now we‚Äôre preparing a summary of every existing computer algorithm for multiplication so we know who to go after infringem</p>
<p>‚Äìa man the elite liberal media love to hate</p>
<p>‚Äìman who can‚Äôt spell his own name</p>
<p>‚Äìthe most unique individual I have ever met</p>
<p>‚Äìsay young fellow, how much salt is in this chicken?</p>
<p>‚ÄìVice President of the <em>Yew</em>nited</p>
<p>‚Äìnk you tuc, and the microphone cut out as the deer eyes flickered between podium and audience, ‚Äìk you all. Like you, I am here tonight to founder, er, honor the foundation of the Arete, ah, all right, Foundation, named after, uh, the Latin, ah Greek word for ah virtue. Coined by that great Greek, uh, soph, sophisticate Pro, Proto, goras who said, ah, Man is the measurer, and I think that is clear, and clearly the lesson of that is, uh, that man is the one who measures, just as we, ah, as men, or women of course, owe it to our fellow man to make sure that he, or she, ah, measures up, as I am sure all the members in this room would like to be measured‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDear God, someone put him out of his</p>
<p>‚Äìso what we need from you Doctor Hite is a list of computer multiplication algorithms that might be infringing on our</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat I need is a chance to eat my chicken peccata, you mind?</p>
<p>‚Äìhonor for me to introduce a man we all ah, honor, I mean, a man to whom this great and beautiful count, the microphone again skipping, ‚Äìdeep debt of ah, skipping again, ‚ÄìR√©ti, applause rising as the old man limped to the podium, scanning the audience with ice blue eyes as he pushed the microphone back an inch. [pg131]</p>
<p>‚ÄìToday the Arete Foundation, indeed the nation, has a special challenge before it. For we stand on the threshold of a new era, a turning point in history. Today, nuclear weapons are obsolete.</p>
<p>‚Äìnot trying to claim exclusive rights, just a modest licensing fee</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf I promise to look at it, will you leave me alone?</p>
<p>‚Äìthank my young colleagues at the Lab, for developing the Superbright laser, cornerstone of the Radiance antimissile defense. For security reasons we cannot reveal the actual intensities we have achieved with this remarkable device. But I assure you that the skeptics will be confounded.</p>
<p>‚Äìjust a small fraction of a cent per operation<a href="#fn67" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>‚Äìyes fine here, here‚Äôs my card, call me, just</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut our work does not stop here. Tonight I will tell you of a remarkable new development. A system of fast, small interceptors that hurl themselves like stones against missiles. Thousands of these devices in low orbit will constantly monitor the globe for threats. If a missile is launched, an interceptor will spot it and knock it down. Today, thanks to startling advances in miniaturization, this system is practical and even cheap.</p>
<p>A sudden crash of dishware from the back of the hall brought the ice blue eyes up and glaring.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCritics now ask, who is our enemy? The Soviets are gone, should we not divert this money to peaceful uses? I will not answer this dangerously naive criticism. Except to say that the prospect of ballistic missiles, in the hands of twenty different governments, makes an effective defense <em>mandatory</em>.</p>
<p>R√©ti‚Äôs voice, slow and heavy with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary" title="Wikipedia: Austria-Hungary">Transyvlvanian</a> accent unrelinquished after sixty years in America, was the aristocrat to Eubanks‚Äôs plebe. A sales talk all the same, and so what? From Plato to Planck, science was persuasion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue%20Concerning%20the%20Two%20Chief%20World%20Systems" title="Wikipedia: Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems">Galileo‚Äôs dialog</a> of Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati was written to persuade, not to prove.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut this is not all. The Slingshot orbiters perfectly fit the new mandate for dual use. In addition to defending against manmade threats, they can protect us from natural calamities.</p>
<p>‚Äìnot just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saturday_Night_Live_commercial_parodies#N" title="New Shimmer">floor wax, it‚Äôs a dessert topping</a></p>

<p>‚Äìextinction of the dinosaurs caused by an enormous meteor impact. Such an impact, if it occurred today, would cost business over eight quadrillion dollars. And these impacts do occur, about once every hundred thousand years. Thus, simple division shows that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid%20impact%20avoidance" title="Wikipedia: Asteroid impact avoidance">killer asteroids</a> cost us eighty billion per year, against which our proposed research budget of two billion per year is if anything too modest.<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>‚Äìnever thought of it that way, amortize the apocalypse</p>
<p>‚ÄìArete‚Äôs parent organization, the respected think tank NOUS, the Nexus for Optimal Use of Science<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a>, has endorsed Slingshot. They have provided Congress and the president with the scientific analysis they need to make informed policy decisions. But science, though necessary, is not sufficient. The Arete Foundation will provide the political will to make the correct choices. For as Einstein once said to me, ‚ÄúAll the wisdom on this earth remains without success if force does not enter into its service.‚Äù<a href="#fn70" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> May that be the watchword of the Arete Foundation as well.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCoffee?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, pushing away from the table as applause rose to bury ‚ÄìWait, Doctor Hite‚Ä¶!, as R√©ti limped from the podium and was lost from sight. Highet skirted tables as people stood, blocking his way, coming against ‚ÄìDid himself in with that <em>read my lips</em>, wait and see, and edging past ‚Äìbillion acres of so-called wilderness ought to be in private hands, as chairs were backed into his path, past ‚Äìimpossible to get reliable help, as the crowd thickened and he pressed through ‚Äìwhat with the deficit, we can‚Äôt afford not to sell off some assets, sighting Venham near an exit with the vice president and Eubanks and R√©ti smiling and shaking hands with a burly man in blue serge, as the nasal voice nearby again nagged, ‚Äìdrive six hundred miles a week, get home I have a right to some peace, while R√©ti turned laughing to Venham, and black mohair fell across the stooped shoulders, ‚Äìwant to build <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High%20Frequency%20Active%20Auroral%20Research%20Program" title="Wikipedia: High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program">a transmitter</a> in the middle of Alaska, one point seven gigawatts beamed straight into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ionosphere" title="Wikipedia: ionosphere">ionosphere</a>, where he lost sight of them, ‚Äìtold Vicente to pull out the olive trees, the fruit was staining the pavement, replace them with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oleander" title="Wikipedia: oleander">oleander</a>, as black mohair hove briefly into sight again under EXIT, ‚Äìturns out the proposal came from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCO" title="Wikipedia: ARCO">Arco</a> scientist, they just happen to have thirty trillion cubic feet of Alaskan natural gas they‚Äôd like to [pg133] sell on site instead of having to pipe it, breaking through to reaching the exit just as two Secret Service agents pulled the door shut and moved to block him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry, sir, no exit here.</p>
<p>In fury he turned and was blocked again by the back of a curly blond head, red scarf, scuffed leather jacket, the nasal voice nagging, ‚Äìgoing all week long, but when I get back Friday at six there he is with uprooted stumps and dirt all over the drive, it looked like a clearcut, with his Salvadoran friends backing a pickup through my rhododendrons, as Highet was jostled and the blond curls turned to face him, annoyance on the snub features turning to surprise and sly pleasure.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo Highet! Is it you? My God, what are you doing here?</p>
<p>‚ÄìChazz? Chazz Hollis?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBarbara, this is my best friend from high school.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHello. Her warm hand in his. Beautiful smile. Sheer silk sheath. Her eyes quickly shifting from his. ‚ÄìChazz, I‚Äôm going to talk to Renata.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll right. We‚Äôll leave soon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLast place I expected to see you, Chazz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm so embarrassed. I had no idea this would be so political. Do you know Bill Venham? He invited me. He‚Äôs been a real friend to the Philharmonic.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôve met. A little conservatism won‚Äôt hurt you, Chazz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat did you think of Eubanks?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot much.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHis radio show is enormously popular.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs it really.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome people say he could run for president.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAny idiot can run for president.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow long has it been, Leo? Twentieth Lancaster High reunion, wasn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>Ten years ago. Out in the trailers licking my wounds. Mercedes liberal looking down his nose at me. Still building bombs? he‚Äôd said.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs right. You‚Äôd just put out a new age album under the name Proteus.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh my gosh, that‚Äôs right. You know, I did that as a lark, but they [pg134] turned out to be my cash cow, those Proteus albums. You‚Äôre where now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm director of the Lab now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo you‚Äôve done pretty well for yourself there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, I‚Äôm juggling about four careers. There‚Äôs a new computer music research center at the university, they‚Äôve created a chair for me, endowed by a recently deceased film composer. Quite a good composer really. All his life in addition to his film work he wrote symphonies, chamber works, an amazing output, but they were never performed. I‚Äôm conducting an evening of his quote serious music at the Hollywood Bowl this summer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDidn‚Äôt know you conducted, Chazz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, yes. Another cash cow. And I have a Proteus album due out in November, though I‚Äôm moving away from that. Oh, and Leo, you‚Äôll be interested in this. At the research center we‚Äôre designing some AI software.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll that and AI software, too, you‚Äôre a versatile guy, Chazz. How‚Äôd you get to be so smart?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, my assistant, he‚Äôs here somewhere, he‚Äôs quite brilliant, he works at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval%20Postgraduate%20School" title="Wikipedia: Naval Postgraduate School">Navy‚Äôs Complexity Institute</a>. It‚Äôs ironic to be adapting his work to music, but I think it makes a statement, converting military technologies to cultural uses. Of course, I use a Macintosh for my own composing, but the research at the Center is much more advanced. We‚Äôre working on a program that can be trained to write in any musical style. It‚Äôs a challenge. One knows very well how Mozart differs from Haydn, but to get from that rather intuitive knowledge to a working program is quite difficult. The university has an intellectual property interest in it. They want to patent algorithms that embody compositional styles. They‚Äôve trademarked a dozen major names, Mozart, Bach, Beeth</p>
<p>‚ÄìTrademarked?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFor marketing new works in the style. Of course we have no idea if this will pan out, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to stake a claim.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSpeaking of technology transfer, we might be able to help you. We‚Äôve done a lot of AI research in house. The algorithm works how, [pg135] exactly?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh,I can‚Äôt tell you exactly, some sort of chaos theory, chaos on the edge of complexity, you should talk to, there he is, Jef! Jef Thorpe, this is Leo Hi</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh you, you know each‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJef used to work for us at the Lab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh is that where‚Ä¶? What a coincidence.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSmall world.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, you two, ah, must have some catching up to do, I‚Äôll, head swiveling as it tracked the crowd past Highet, dispensing a smile here, a nod there, hand groping in an inner pocket for ‚Äìmy card, Leo, the home phone‚Äôs changing next week, I‚Äôm moving to Palos Verde, actually that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm, ah ha, I see my realtor over there, glad I ran into you, Leo, we‚Äôll talk again. Jef, see you Monday‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThorpe, blackjacketed arms crossed over red t-shirt, said, ‚ÄìSomeone told me, the fish rots from the head.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet me explain something to you, Jef‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo need, I understand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you really? Do you understand how Quine screwed you? With those secondary reflectors?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah. I also know the primaries were giving bad data all along. That‚Äôs what got me jigging the code in the first place. Because I trusted the data and I saw how to make the simulation correspond.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou think I wanted to blame you? Quine was group leader, you were his assistant. Your fingerprints were on the code. And you had a history.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat does that mean, a hist</p>
<p>‚ÄìFish and Himmelhoch.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs totally unfair! I had nothing to do with</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs fair got to do with it? Quine was my man, I protected him. Even though I despise him. He‚Äôs gone now, if it makes you feel better.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, so am I, gone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLearn from this, Jef. Protect yourself. Be ruthless.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMan‚Ä¶ shaking his head, ‚ÄìI‚Äôm not sorry I‚Äôm gone. [pg136]</p>
<p>‚ÄìEnjoy your honeymoon at Complexity. But stay in touch. That Richtmyer-Meshkov work you were doing is hot, we can use that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis, what, this is unbelievable. Why should I share anything with you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause in the long run we‚Äôre on the same side. I won‚Äôt forget that and I‚Äôm betting you won‚Äôt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMan, there it is. The Highet Effect. That reality distortion field. It‚Äôs amazing. You‚Äôll say anything, won‚Äôt you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou heard R√©ti‚Äôs speech. Knowledge and force.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI heard it. Einstein my ass.</p>
<p>And turned from Thorpe, going into the corridor towards MEN, where a hotel employee blocked him with a mop held like a quarterstaff, ‚ÄìClosed, there‚Äôs another down the hall, and on past Space Reality Space Fantasy Art Expo where orbiters and battle stations and shuttles and starships were clustered in promiscuous congress against airbushed starscapes no telescopes had ever viewed, past a booth where a woman in hot pink jogging bra and satin shorts, wool socks, heavy boots, and backpack walked a treadmill, face hidden in a helmet stenciled VIRTUAL WILDERNESS above a smile fixed in Cheshire Cat detachment at the mountain landscape projected on screens for the spectators‚Äô benefit behind her pumping legs, and went on past CodeWin, where the pressure of his bladder led him into a dim alcove lit by a screen with the image of hair not dark or wild but bright as a carrot, lips pouting and slim, white legs raised for ‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile%20Command" title="Wikipedia: Missile Command">Missile defense</a>! as a cacophony burst from another booth where one boy urged another facing a barrage of incoming graphs, ‚ÄìFire! Fire! Fire! and on past AMNESTY INTERACTIVE where high resolution graphics and digital audio lent the prison cell and repetitive screams a gritty chic, finally attaining the relative peace of MEN where two figures at urinals, one in black mohair, one in black mohair, one in blue serge, backs stiff and legs spraddled to produce in porcelain tones an intermittent tenor aria and a profounder chiming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figured%20bass%23Basso%20continuo" title="Wikipedia: Figured bass#Basso continuo">continuou</a>, over which serge was saying ‚Äì<em>agenturnaya razvedka</em>, information coming through network of undercover case officers. Codename Star wished that his information may not be traceable to anyone on Manhattan Project staff<a href="#fn71" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a>, and Bill Venham turning slightly saw Highet, the tenor flow stuttering and ceasing, ‚ÄìLeo! [pg1367] Pull up a pew. Say hi to my new friend Vassili.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan‚Äôt get away from you, can I, Bill. Thanks for setting me up with old Stan there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìStan?</p>
<p>‚ÄìStan, Stan Flack, remember? Of course, not being a regent, he didn‚Äôt know a hell of a lot about my situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh hell, that‚Äôs all over, Leo, you should be looking for new possibilities, that‚Äôs why I hooked you up with Stan there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you mean, that‚Äôs all over?</p>
<p>Venham shook, tucked, and came to the sink, while serge continued his relentless basso under the soprano and alto of two faucets.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRegents, DOE, that‚Äôs the old order, Leo. Give us a couple years and we‚Äôll close down DOE<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a>, move it all into the private sector. We‚Äôve got a position paper on this, I‚Äôll send you a copy.</p>
<p>The chiming in the Russian‚Äôs bowl tapered off, then began again.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho‚Äôs he?</p>
<p>‚ÄìVassili‚Äôs in from Moscow. With some very hot info about a certain Manhattan Project scientist who passed atomic secrets to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD" title="Wikipedia: NKVD">NKVD</a> during the war.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot Aron, I hope.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHa ha! Oh, Vassili‚Äôs a gold mine of information on the Stalin era, I‚Äôm offering him a position at NOUS. Say, that reminds me, did you get my letter?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBeen a little busy, I‚Äôll ask my girl.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre keeping a pew warm. There‚Äôs a place for you anytime you want it.</p>
<p>The basso continuo at last diminished, retarded, and ceased with a heartfelt sigh. ‚ÄìBozhe moi. [My god.]</p>
<p>‚ÄìGot to be going, Bill, stopped by a hand plucking his lapel, tucking a light green vellum envelope into his inner jacket pocket, then smoothing the fabric.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGive it some thought, Leo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere can I find Aron?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron? He‚Äôs long gone. Listen Leo, about this cold fusion thing‚Ä¶ but Highet likewise was gone, out past MULTIMEDIA and the air-brushed infinities, past abandoned mop and bucket by Out Of Order, [pg138] pausing only in the lobby for MEN and the relief he had not earlier taken.</p>
<p>Didn‚Äôt even get to talk to him. Call him tomorrow. Might be too late. Driving up from the bowels of the garage, surfacing to wait for the flash and shriek of ∆é∆Ü–òA‚ÖÉU·ô†MA passing and in its wake traffic streaming then thinning as the city fell away behind him. Stars above thin cloud. In the valley a misty rain began and his wipers switched themselves on. The syncopated rhythm lulled him over the pass. Wasted trip. Down to a bright grid flat against void, and off at J Street.</p>
<p>Thea looked up from reading as the door stuck then flew open to strike the IV stand that fell clattering.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow was your dinner?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDidn‚Äôt expect to find you still here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wasn‚Äôt sure you were coming back. I didn‚Äôt want to leave Mother alone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI see the stand arrived. Place right here in town Thea, they even deliver, if you‚Äôd look in the yellow pages.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell now we have two.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh for Christ‚Äôs sake.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, you didn‚Äôt tell me you were going to buy one.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, so return it. How is she?</p>
<p>‚ÄìShe went to bed a little while ago. She was waiting up for you, but she tires easily. Her light‚Äôs still on. You might say good night.</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen, about dinner. I told you I had things to do while I was here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know, Leo. I know nobody‚Äôs going to change. Mark is coming tomorrow morning for breakfast. Is that all right? Do you have something else? Just so I know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI need to be in Westwood by noon. Breakfast is fine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll be here about eight. Will you say good night to Mother?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Light under the closed door. He stood by it for a moment, then went in.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, dear. It‚Äôs so good to see you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHello Mother. He stood by the IV, not looking at her. Hanging plastic sack, D5 Half-Normal Saline Dextrose 55 1000 mL OSMOLARITY [pg139] 273 mOsmol/L (CALC) STERILE NONPYROGENIC SINGLE DOSE CONTAINER. Blue plastic gauze pads on the bedside table. Brown plastic pill bottles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorambucil" title="Wikipedia: Chlorambucil">Chlorambucil</a>. Small milky plastic cup holding a tablespoon of clear liquid. Spot of dried blood on the pillowcase.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, I‚Äôm so glad you came. Her thin gray hand reaching for him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow are you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, Leo. I‚Äôm so tired.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMother, can I ask you something about Dad?</p>
<p>She looked away, then turned back brightly. ‚ÄìDo you remember, when your father taught you to shoot? You‚Äôd go after jackrabbits, you two, and come home hungry as hunters, and I‚Äôd have dinner waiting and I‚Äôd say, Home are the hunters. Do you remember, Leo? Oh, you loved that. Because it was your middle name, Hunter, yours and your father‚Äôs. After your grandpa. But you wouldn‚Äôt eat the rabbits.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I remember. Mother, listen, when Dad lost the election</p>
<p>Her eyes pleading. ‚ÄìLeo. All I ever wanted from your father was a body to hug and a soul to cherish. He was such a distant man.</p>
<p>He patted the thin gray hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI need to take my medicine. Hand me that little cup, dear.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHere. What is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMorphine. She swallowed. ‚ÄìAnd then he put himself beyond me forever.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll be down the hall if you need anything.</p>
<p>In the hall ghost voices chattered and nagged. Her radio, constant irritant of his childhood, her distraction and defense, all day and all night, one in every room. To drown that memory now he shut his door and switched on the radio on the night table, whence sprung a voice rich with the false resonance of digital signal processing, ‚Äìspace music, reflecting the natural cycle, of birth, life, and death. For the next hour, space travelers, Earth Journey‚Ä¶ the voice fading to a mix of bells, flute, rattles, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talking%20drums" title="Wikipedia: talking drums">talking drums</a>, bass guitar, and the nasal whine of synthesizer. He unpacked laptop and cell phone and plugged them into their chargers. Groping behind the night table for the outlet he saw a corner of faded blue in the dust and cobwebs. A small cotton sack filled with catnip. Lancelot. Orange and white tom butting his head against your leg, loud growling purr. Thirty, forty years ago. Toy can‚Äôt have [pg140] been back there that long. No, of course, Mother had that skinny Siamese died last year. Pellet of paper back there in the dust. Smoothing it open to her looping hand: <em>you are not my keeper</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus, he muttered, kicking off his shoes. Nobody‚Äôs going to change. He turned off the light and reclined on the coverlet staring at the ceiling, holding the cat toy. Lancelot would climb onto his chest to sleep. Purring hum at his breast. He missed it now.</p>
<p>‚Äìspace music, celebrating the, natural cycle, by the, Los Angeles based composer, Proteus. For a playlist, ask for program, three thirty nine, Earth Journ, and snapped it off.</p>
<p>The natural cycle: homage to cruelty and waste. What use heaven makes of its beings. Sets them to strive and build under incommutable sentence of death. If he were younger he might pit all his force and resolve against this enemy, this faceless minion of haven, if not to beat death at least to put it off. Why shouldn‚Äôt people live for centuries? What could they not accomplish?</p>
<p>All I really wanted was to do physics. The structure of the universe. The nature of matter. Members of the Academy, ladies and gentlemen. And what have I accomplished? Chemist of people, catalyst, holding the place together so others can do the real work. Like young Quine, that paper he coauthored with Sorokin years ago, that was the real thing. Still know it when I see it. Well, he‚Äôll never get back to it now. Bitter satisfaction there. Reduced to living on others‚Äô failures.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs coming apart. Dietz‚Äôs building, falling. Hanging on to the cliff, looking for the next handhold. Rock biting his palms. No one tells you what you need to live.</p>
<p>Leo had to pee. In the hall he saw light under the basement door. Leo opened the door and went down the stairs holding the rail tight. Come here boy. Light glowed amber in the shotglass. Papers and maps overflowed the desk. These are streets, see. Placentia, Palm, Pioneer. We live here. The new streets will be here. Vacant parcels in A-17. Land‚Äôs cheap now, but it‚Äôll be valuable. The sharp smell as Dad sipped from the shotglass.</p>
<p>Dad yelling at mother because Gramp wouldn‚Äôt loan him the money to buy property. Worthless patch of desert. Shortsighted old fool, it‚Äôll double in three years! Finally he forged the old fool‚Äôs name on a check. [pg141] What a stink over that.</p>
<p>Vast echoing dimness. Endless rows of lockers and benches. Blurred voices, the smell of sweat and mildew. Leo comes to an arena of light and steam. All the showers are running. There his father stands naked with a sullen young man. Father pulls at the player‚Äôs swelling penis and looks up unsmiling at Leo.</p>
<p>Abruptly awake. A sigh almost a moan escaped him. Best for all concerned that you.</p>
<p>Fuck them. Fuck them all. Let them try it. They can‚Äôt do this to me, they don‚Äôt have the votes. He rose and crossed the hall. He stood voiding. The floodlight outside dimly lit the bowl. In its light noiseless rain drifted down a fathomless sky. On the distant highway, trucks whined, wheels hissed on wet road. As he returned to his room and lay down, he felt a wave of weakness, almost the body‚Äôs disgust with itself. I have nothing left for this fight.</p>
<p>Leo at the back door snapped on the floodlight. In its glare, half hidden by a creosote bush, stood a long slim canine with the slinking frame of a scavenger and a bushy tail upright. Its eyes were golden coals and in its narrow jaws it held the neck of an orange and white cat with head and paws dangling, tail curled under. Lancelot turned his head into the light and his pink mouth opened in a silent mewl. The coyote bolted into darkness with the cat.</p>
<p>Get up. Get dressed. Are you angry with that coyote? We‚Äôll get him. In the dawn halflight his father stood. Dumb with sorrow and sleep Leo dressed. He took the rifle his father thrust at him. The sky gew light and they hiked into the sandy hills behind the house. Nothing moved for miles in that pale ungiving light. Leo wanted to ask if Lancelot might have gotten away, if they might still find him, but the question died in his throat.</p>
<p>Eyes wide, he listened to the hollow ceaseless hiss of the universe. He reached for the inhaler, cylinder cold in his hand‚Äôs warmth, an exaltation like freefall as the spray struck his sinuses.</p>
<p>Dad. Tell me what I need to live. Read to me like you did.</p>
<p>Once there was a man, a rocket man, in his coalblack uniform coated with stardust, a man alone in the night of space. A proud man, and brave. On his shoulders lay the fate of the world. His rocket ship left [pg142] the Earth on a pillar of fire. It climbed up and out of the gravity well. Spewing a hard white fountain of flame. Behind it the Earth dwindled, and all he had ever known dwindled with it: his family, his friends, his past. The Earth dwindled to the size of a basketball, a grapefruit, a blood orange, a lemon. A ball bearing. Lancelot‚Ä¶! And deep in the void waited a sickness and a disease, and it came upon the man, and it was called the Loneliness<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a>. Deep, lustrous desert sky, still as death, and in its darkness waits the hidden enemy, Sputnik could it be? A strong man took the leadership in war, one who had once blinked at the sun and dreamt that perhaps he might snare it, and was roused to convey to his brothers that indeed he had done so<a href="#fn74" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a>, and had thus led them out of the caves and finally into space itself. There! And there! Points of flight. The enemy. Deep in space, cruciform in a ship no larger than a bodysuit he fingered controls in his gloves, he darted and fired at his opponents. Fire. Fire. Fire.</p>
<p>And the sky gathered color as a sun still unrisen scattered rays across a serene paleness cut by a blunt black triangle outracing its own hollow roar, as though to assert that the day alone did not suffice, its beauty a goad and a challenge to the discontent spirit. A key scratched in the front door which gave its grunt of resistance and paper bags rustled to the kitchen and water ran in the master bathroom through pipes singing beneath the house, the dirges of childhood, as he stared at the same ceiling he had forty years ago. Highet thrust himself out of bed.</p>
<p>At the dining room table sat Thea, reading a newspaper. ‚ÄìGood morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThea, what are these? fetching from a pocket and flattening <em>sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely night</em>, and <em>you are not my keeper</em>.</p>
<p>She sighed. ‚ÄìOh, the fortune cookies.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFortune cookies?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs what Mark and I call them. She‚Äôs been leaving them around the house for years. I find them under sofa cushions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese were downstairs and in the guest room.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe think they‚Äôre her way of dealing with Father‚Äôs death.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs twenty-five years ago, Thea.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, she hasn‚Äôt ever wanted to admit‚Ä¶ you know. [pg143]</p>
<p>‚ÄìTwenty-five years and she still thinks he just dozed off with the motor running in the gar</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, hush. Please. I hear her coming. The pipes stopped singing. Then, rising, her voice brisk, ‚ÄìI‚Äôll start breakfast. Mark will be here soon. You see if Mother needs help.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot the kind I can give her, sweeping the paper strips into his pocket. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôre up on this pop psych stuff, you know the word denial? Dad with the booze, Mark with the sports, Mom with the radio, you</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou with the science, Leo. Would you please</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, all right. Mother! Do you need help?</p>
<p>She was in a housecoat and slippers leaning against the chrome walker at the bedside.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you need help with that, Mother?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI hate this horrid thing. If I could lean on you, darling.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHere. He extended a crooked elbow.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry to be a bother, dear.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs no bother.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou look so handsome in your suit. Like your father when he ran for office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHope I do a little better here than he did.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe would have won, dear, but the local machine was against him. A little slower, darling. her fingers dug into his forearm.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre a tough old bird, Mother, you‚Äôll outlive us all.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSit there, Mother, I‚Äôll bring you some juice. Mark will be here soon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThank you, Thea. Leo, darling, would you turn on the radio?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh Christ.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTuck Eubanks is on.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow can you listen to that crap?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow, I don‚Äôt agree with everything he says, but he makes some very good points.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo? Can I see you in the kitchen?</p>
<p>He turned from the skull so visible under the thin white hair, as the orotund voice sprung from the radio, ‚Äìthis attempt to tug people‚Äôs heartstrings has wrung dry, and strode into the kitchen where his sister waited, arms folded. [pg144]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, Thea. You mean I should just shut up and let her listen to that poisonous buffoon?</p>
<p>In a tense whisper, ‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs exactly what I mean. And keep your voice down. You‚Äôre acting like a spoiled child.</p>
<p>His voice fell likewise. ‚ÄìShe does that to me, she always has, you know that. This is a mistake, me being here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre making it one. You‚Äôre making it one so that you can avoid dealing with it, as usual. You are so ungiving.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRight, got about fifty urgent things need doing, went out of my way to clear some time drove three hundred miles but that‚Äôs not enough, you know what it is Thea, nothing‚Äôs enough, you turn everything into some kind of drama and if people don‚Äôt play their part they‚Äôre ungiving. If you want to know, that‚Äôs why Bob finally left you, your constant dramatizing, and he tried to go along with it all, playing a dozen different parts, kept giving till there was nothing left to give.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeave Bob out of this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere you go, Bob‚Äôs not in your script any more, so leave him out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre the last one to talk about relationships.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, no doubt, but I‚Äôm talking about you, Thea, how you‚Äôve got zero tolerance for anything not in your movie.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou always have to win, Leo. I know that so well, but it always surprises me. Everything‚Äôs a conflict to you. No wonder you‚Äôre good at your job.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust look around sometime Thea if you don‚Äôt think everything‚Äôs a conflict, just look around you for one goddamn min</p>
<p>‚ÄìThea, dear? I think Mark is here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThank you, Mother. All right, Leo, could we have peace for, for just one hour? Just through breakfast?</p>
<p>He went out the kitchen door into the back yard. The fig tree, barren of bloom, burdened with the weight of its own branches, swayed stiffly in a warm and steady wind. A heavy dry scent from some unseen flower itched his nose, heavy with mucus, and he blew to clear it. The doorbell turned him back inside.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre looking more and more like Dad, Mark. [pg145]</p>
<p>‚ÄìNew car, Leo? Very sporty. Pity about the scratch on the hood.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow‚Äôs life in the trades?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLocally, it sucks. But we‚Äôve got enough work out Newhall way.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow are Mary and the children, dear?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood good, they‚Äôre good, Mom. Gary just started Little League, he‚Äôs real excited about that. How‚Äôs with you, Leo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìComplexity on the edge of chaos. Had to run off last night to a dinner.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI heard.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow do you all want your eggs? Mother, I know you want poached. Leo? Mark?</p>
<p>‚ÄìScrambled, Thea, thanks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust coffee.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt want anything, Leo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, got something else at noon down below.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSit, sit down, all of you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSay, Mark, got a construction question for you. When you truck fill away from a site</p>
<p>‚ÄìAway? Usually you truck it in.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell say you‚Äôve got too much of it. What would you do with it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, if it‚Äôs good fill, nonexpansive, you‚Äôd take it to another site that needs it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOne of your own sites?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf you‚Äôve got one that needs it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou ever hear of Credne Construction?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe statewide low bid kings. They‚Äôve cost me work. Why?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust curious. They‚Äôre doing some work at the Lab. I pass their trucks every day.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey do industrial work and tract homes. Those new developments about by Adelanto? That kind of thing. I don‚Äôt know about their industrial, but their tract workers get paid by the piece, not hourly. That‚Äôs incentive to cut corners.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThea, you hear this? Credne‚Äôs the contractor out at Estancia. Tell her she doesn‚Äôt want to live there, Mark.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat the hell do you care where she lives, Leo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust want to keep her out of my neighborhood. [pg146]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, don‚Äôt ask my help.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm POed, Thea. He‚Äôs been doing this since I came in, how‚Äôs life in the trades, I look like Dad‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt need this from a guy we see once every five years.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, don‚Äôt let it get to you, Mark, I‚Äôm leaving.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh Leo. Mark why did you have to</p>
<p>‚ÄìMe? He‚Äôs blowing us off, and it‚Äôs my fault?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNobody‚Äôs fault, sit down Thea, just got to run, some things I have to</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, please sit down. Finish your coffee‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThea, I don‚Äôt need this any more than he does.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease, dear‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs great at this, always has been. Toss a stink bomb, get everyone fighting, and he‚Äôs out the door.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease, let‚Äôs not fight.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMark. Mother‚Äôs right.</p>
<p>Mark looked at Thea, then at Mother. His nostrils flared, his mouth tight. Like their father. Then it passed. Mark rose and held out his hand. ‚ÄìSorry, Leo. If you have to go, you have to go. Stay in touch, will you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt was good of you to come, dear. We are all so proud of you. Thin arms reaching for him. Smell of medicine. He accepted her hug.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake care of yourself, mother. I‚Äôll call.</p>
<p>Thea came to hug hum. ‚ÄìGoodbye. I‚Äôll call you about Estancia.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, all right I, hesitating at the front door as it stick, ‚Äìseems, ‚Ä¶seems like I‚Äôm forgetting something. Turning back to the three pairs of eyes fixed on him as he raised sunglasses in a halfhearted token of farewell, donning them against the glare that broke in shards on the concrete walk and asphalt and again on the distant glitter of tall buildings and again on the pebbled glass under his parked wheels by the yellow tape CAUTION CUIDADO knotted like some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superstring" title="Wikipedia: superstring">superstring</a> of distress and disruption through the world, reaching it seemed from the Lab to Westwood, as he followed the shards past boarded windows as two rollerblades zipped by in t-shirts NO FEAR trailing a sound newly in the world, a sly hiss from their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten%20carbide" title="Wikipedia: Tungsten carbide">carbide</a> wheels, another spinoff [pg147] of a Lab project in composite materials, its ingenuity knotted throughout the world, his mark, putting resolution into his step as he went under a granite architrave FIAT LUX and down an echoing hall to pause at an oak door, hand stilled on knob by the patrician voice from within, ‚Äìstrategic deception, that‚Äôs what Whipple called it. He claimed that the entire point of the [SDI] program was to force the Soviets to spend<a href="#fn75" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>Cool light through slatted shades, dark conference lustrous as old coin. He recognized some of the faces.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSir, this meeting is closed‚Ä¶ Doctor Highet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI believe you‚Äôre discussing my contract.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis, this is, your presence here is most inappropriate.</p>
<p>‚ÄìInappropriate? And him? pointing to the figure who upon his entrance had gone silent as a pallbearer, ‚ÄìHe‚Äôs just giving a little impartial advice?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator Chase is here at our invitation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe senator wants my head. I know this. You know this. I‚Äôd like to defend myself.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet, you know how performance reviews work. When we‚Äôve gathered enough data</p>
<p>‚ÄìEnough rope, you mean.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe really cannot have</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is just the sort of antic he‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚ÄìHell, Charles, let the man sit in, what harm can it do? Senator?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine with me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell it‚Äôs irregular and I want it noted that I don‚Äôt approve.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo noted.</p>
<p>He seated himself at the far end of the table, facing Chase, two chairs away from any regent.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet, one of our concerns is your evident lack of support for the post-Cold War mission DOE has defined for the Lab, specifically technology transfer. The perception is that you are heavily invested in the Radiance antimissile program.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve long been an advocate of technology transfer. I‚Äôve spearheaded many collaborations with industry. We‚Äôve just made an agreement with Gate Cellular that will double the net worth of our dual use technologies. [pg148]</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome evaluations of your performance‚Ä¶ well, here, underestimates difficulties and time frames, more concerned with public perceptions than realities, combative style, profane and tactless, abrasive sometimes abusive, serious problems accepting criticism, ten bad ideas for every good one‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho wrote that?</p>
<p>‚Äìand recent articles in the press about Radiance tend to support a view of, well, here, numerous inaccuracies, misleading statements, unresolved issues, out of control, emerging picture of mismanagement and impropriety, does the competent and honest scientists at the Lab a disservice‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI should get the name of your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clipping%20service" title="Wikipedia: clipping service">clipping service</a>. Don‚Äôt tell me you take that seriously?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe university takes these accusations very seriously. They reflect on our oversight.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPress gets hold of a few rumors, plays right into the popular mistrust of science and government, pretty soon you‚Äôve got a feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, you‚Äôve got five ongoing GAO investigations, two DOE, six congressional</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell Doctor Beckman half of those aren‚Äôt us, they‚Äôre you, it‚Äôs the university‚Äôs oversight being questioned.</p>
<p>‚Äìwithout laying blame, Doctor Highet, it does seem that the Radiance program and all its ah unresolved issues are associated rightly or wrongly with your personality.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe you don‚Äôt want a scientist at the helm. Maybe you want a salesman.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt seems to me we have that already, said Chase. ‚ÄìThirty billion dollars wasted on a fraud, a deception</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator, you got your money‚Äôs worth. Radiance spent the Soviet Union into oblivion. Nothing fraudulent about that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you deny that you deceived, misled</p>
<p>‚ÄìWar is deception.<a href="#fn76" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you hear that? That‚Äôs exactly what Whipple said to me. Are you admitting that this program is a deception?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot at all.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease, Doctor Highet, Senator Chase, we‚Äôre not going to resolve [pg149] the larger issues, I really think</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, let‚Äôs cut the, to the, bottom line, what happens to me? Got that figured out yet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs approp</p>
<p>‚ÄìCom on, I‚Äôm here, let‚Äôs have it.</p>
<p>Hum of overhead lights. Sun slanting through dust. Jet scraping past far overhead.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe think it best for all concerned that you resign.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy contract has over a year to run.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAbsent a resignation, we will recommend that the regents terminate your contract.</p>
<p>‚ÄìResignation to be effective when.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn one month.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen you have a replacement in mind.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFor the short term you will appoint an interim director.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs, you know, <em>appropriate</em> to consult with an outgoing director about his successor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs premature at this time.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome on, who‚Äôs on your short list, Ware? Szabo? Karp?</p>
<p>Glances exchanged. Chase sat back, his face blank, until after a pause Beckman spoke up, ‚ÄìWe‚Äôre impressed by Doctor Philip Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine!</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine addressed the problems of the Radiance program with candor and resolve.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine!</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet, we</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know that he‚Äôs been put on leave?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, for writing a report critical of Superbright, I gather, said Chase.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf you‚Äôd read that report, you‚Äôd learn that he had a major role in what you‚Äôre calling this deception.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs what I mean by candor, said Chase.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe candor was mine. I ordered that report.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI ah, for one, I think that is wholly to Doctor Highet‚Äôs credit.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOrdered it and then suppressed it, said Chase.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou can‚Äôt jump a man from deputy associate to director. [pg150]</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan‚Äôt, Doctor Highet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere are ten associate directors with more seniority, there are scores of group leaders with twenty and thirty years experience, you can‚Äôt just pass them over, especially for</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet, I can‚Äôt say I appreciate you telling us what we can or can‚Äôt do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen to me. Philip Quine is the classic bad hire. For eight years he did nothing. I finally found something I thought he could handle and he screwed it up and tried to assign blame.</p>
<p>Pages turned. ‚ÄìYou hired him, didn‚Äôt you? Kept him on? Promoted him?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes I did. That was poor judgment on my part.</p>
<p>Highet caught Chase‚Äôs faint smile at that. ‚ÄìI‚Äôm warning you not to make the same mistake. Quine has no experience, no stature, no leadership. He‚Äôs incapable of making public statements.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs a plus, said Chase, still with his calm tortoise smile.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs erratic and unreliable, and he has a drug problem.</p>
<p>That interested Logue. ‚ÄìReally? We have no evidence of</p>
<p>At last Chase was annoyed. ‚ÄìOh come on, he‚Äôs doing it again, don‚Äôt get drawn into</p>
<p>‚ÄìKnow something Senator? You‚Äôre gone. Next election. Wait and see.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy, are your rightwing friends going to target me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease, Senator, Doct</p>
<p>‚ÄìThink you can use this nation‚Äôs security as a political football you‚Äôll find otherwise pretty damn quic</p>
<p>‚ÄìSecurity is exactly what worried me, Highet. I want you and your mouth gone before the entire Lab is tainted by your commitment to this disastrous program.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd if I won‚Äôt resign?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo I have to spell it out? Lying to Congress, misappropriate of funds, conflict of interest‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìConflic</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf you think I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve been up to with your shell companies and your job shops, selling knowledge and technologies [pg151] developed with public funds</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome off it, there‚Äôs nothing illegal about spinoffs, and besides</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you want to go through a hearing? I think you remember what that‚Äôs like.</p>
<p>He had a picture of himself then. Twenty years ago in Geneva. The Soviet delegate looking at him in disbelief as he said what everyone there knew: that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABM-1%20Galosh" title="Wikipedia: ABM-1 Galosh">Soviet antimissile system</a> being offered as a bargaining chip was made worthless by the new American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRVs" title="Wikipedia: MIRVs">MIRVs</a>. And then the awful silence in which he knew that he had ruined himself. In that silence he had learned how disliked he was. No one stood up for him, no one attempted to cover for him. That silence followed him as he walked afterward by the lake, with the swans gliding by, followed him through his years of penance and obscurity in the Lab‚Äôs temporary trailers as he slowly reconstructed his career, working on deadwood projects no one wanted, through years of swallowed pride and cagey maneuvering, the silence that could be covered only by doing and more doing, and it was here now, as they all looked at him, saying nothing. He was as alone and unprotected as he had ever been, like his father when the hammer had fallen on him. And in that silence he heard that temptation of a stillness in which doing might cease.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease, gentlemen, no one wants‚Ä¶ this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThink you‚Äôre God‚Äôs gift to the republic, don‚Äôt you Chase, scourge of the military industrial complex</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs not what this is about.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, then? Why do you have it in for me, Chase?</p>
<p>Chase squared his papers in an oblong of sun. He took off his glasses. ‚ÄìLast autumn, when I visited the Lab, you called me a traitor<a href="#fn77" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a>. I don‚Äôt take that from anyone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou hear? said Highet hoarsely. ‚ÄìIt‚Äôs personal. He has it in for me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour judgment is the issue, said Chase. ‚ÄìThat showed extremely poor judgement.</p>
<p>Dillard cleared his throat. ‚ÄìDo you have anything more to say, Doctor Highet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo. But this is not over.</p>
<p>And went out under FIAT LUX into sun hazed by high cloud ridged [pg152] and swirled, light congealed there in strange and lovely tumult, as if some angel of chaos had passed through the air. Not until he was on the freeway did he open his phone and arrow to R√©ti‚Äôs number. Six times it trilled in his ear. When the answering machine picked up, Highet held for a moment, then pressed END. He must succor himself. Settling sunglasses he was soon through the suburbs and out of the valley, climbing past FAR-GO Mini Mart and IN-N-OUT BURGER, and on past Elevation 2000 Ft to Agua Dulce Airport, then descending past the sandstone-red rooftops of new developments, Willow Creek Village from 459,900 to Antelope Valley Urgent Care, Best Buy, Target, K Mart, Grace Christian Superstore, on past Assembly of God, NO MAN COME IN THE FATHER BUT BY ME NOT BY MIGHT NOT BY POWER BUT BY MY SPIRIT, while he thumbed the radio for ‚Äìthe Lord commended the unjust steward, for the children of this world are wiser than the children of light<a href="#fn78" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a>,and silenced it at a flashing in the hills out beyond Mojave, synchronized points of light, hidden as the road wound up among slabs ribbed vertically by erosion, tilted layers and stony hummocks of sienna, brick, and chalkgreen, and on this sandy paleness dark clumps of sage, juniper, joshua, rising to a plateau stitched by power lines, where colonies of windmills flashed in the dull sunlight on both sides of the road.</p>
<p>At the crest he stopped. He stilled the engine and stepped out. Wind whipped at his hair and clothes, and he felt a strange peace. He watched the windmills flash, the two and three vaned propellers, the eggbeaters. After Geneva, in the temporary trailers, he had worked on all these designs<a href="#fn79" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a>. Though disgraced, he realized, he had been happy then<a href="#fn80" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a>. He had nothing to do but rise.</p>
<p>He pulled on a cotton jacket and began walking. A dirt road led up the nearest hill. Cloud moved in the wind and its mottled shadow hurried across the valley below. Even in the lee of the hill the wind was strong. Above him blades flashed and sang. He hiked following a chainlink fence, his soles slipping on the long dry grass, until the fence gave way to barbed wire, where, hand on a weathered post for balance, wire shaking under his shoe, he vaulted over.</p>
<p>He stopped near a twovaned rotor. The Lab had waived commercial rights. His first Devon Null spinoff. On a twenty meter pole sat a [pg153] white nacelle, surface mottled with rust, blades blurred in the wind. Up there a hawk beat against a crosswind, stalled in a cloudbreak of sun blazoning its broad <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rufous" title="Wikipedia: rufous">rufous</a> tail. Its shrill whistle fell, and a gust hurried it on toward the tower, wings taut and swerving, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental%20impact%20of%20wind%20power%23Birds" title="Wikipedia: Environmental impact of wind power#Birds">wind swept it into the blades</a>, and their songs trembled as the hawk struck and traveled on, rising and falling away in a long arc like a tossed stone.</p>
<p>He found it fallen in some sage. Big dun body striped with black bands. Head lolling from the broken neck‚Äôs ruff, eye half open, a drop of blood at the beak. Strong horny claws grasping nothing. Already an ant moved across the feathers. Bitter smell of broken sage. In the sun rotors flashed like pitiless clockwork. Against the wind he walked back to the car.</p>
<p>They‚Äôll do it. They‚Äôll take Quine because he‚Äôs a good gray drone, never done anything worth doing, but he looks clean to them. They‚Äôll give him a year or so, let the place run on autopilot till the sink of scandal clears, and there‚Äôs a new secretary of energy, and he‚Äôll be out. But I‚Äôll be long gone.</p>
<p>Under a sky gone flat gray the car shuddered in a gust past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendocino%20National%20Forest" title="Wikipedia: Mendocino National Forest">Land of Many Uses</a><a href="#fn81" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colusa%20County%2C%20California" title="Wikipedia: Colusa County, California">THIS</a> IS A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home%20rule%20in%20the%20United%20States" title="Wikipedia: Home rule in the United States">HOME RULE COUNTY</a> handlettered and flanked by two crudely painted American flags, and the mournful voice of Robert Johnson ‚Äìstones in my passway and my road seems dark at n, n, n<a href="#fn82" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a>, the disk skipping with a cold digital chatter, a sound newly in the world, ‚Äìnemies have betrayed me, have overtaken poor Bob at last, and with a finger he stilled the player which extruded its disk like a silver tongue, as a small town passed in a blur of FRYING RABBITS &amp; BABY BUNNIES, Very LA Cellular &amp; Pager, PICK &amp; PULL SELF SERVE AUTO PARTS above two fenced lots beneath high tension lines stretching on past sagebrush and joshua trees, Federal Prison Camp, Living Ghost Town, Litter Removed Next 2 Miles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20John%20Birch%20Society" title="Wikipedia: The John Birch Society">The John Birch Society</a>, featureless acres of Mitsubishi Cement rolling by while the catenaries of power lines rose and fell between towers, rhythmic as the hand that absently began to press the firmness in his lap rising less from desire than from boredom, from the body‚Äôs inscrutable tyrannies, even as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar%20detector" title="Wikipedia: Radar detector">detector</a> on the dash chirped and flashed the presence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%20band" title="Wikipedia: K band">K band</a> radar bringing both hands back to the wheel and the speedometer needle dropping below 80, 70, to hover at 65 for the [pg154] oncoming black and white cruiser‚Äôs U turn across the divider to follow at a distance, as his eyes traveled from mirror to road to dashboard to mirror until the cruiser‚Äôs abrupt turn back across the divider to recede, lights, flashing, in pursuit of a less attentive speeder heading south, and the needle rose again past 70, 80, 90, wheels consuming the stripe of road that led north to a horizon jagged as some graph, while to the west the nearer peaks vanished into a turbulent mist, and wind whipped across a dry lake bed to lift alkali in twisting columns white as chalk in sudden sunlight moving like smoke across the dappled plain toward the arid eastern range wrinkled and dark under dense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenticular%20clouds" title="Wikipedia: lenticular clouds">lenticular clouds</a> flowing from the western crest across the valley and trailing dark streamers.</p>
<p>The highway climbed into that darkness, past Elev 6000, until he reached his turnoff and snow flurred into the bitter evening halflight. Flakes had begun to collect in the ruts of the dirt road PRIVATE Posted No Trespassing at the end of which was parked a van Department of Energy Official Use Only with three inches of snow on its roof. Lights shone in the windows of the ranch.</p>
<p>In the entranceway, duffels carryalls and laptops were piled. Highet removed his coat, and from a wallpeg lifted and jauntily donned a billed cap <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%20constant" title="Wikipedia: Planck constant"><em>e</em>=<em>hf</em></a>, hanging his cotton jacket on the freed peg.

<p>‚ÄìLeo, you made it! Pull up a pew. We just microwaved some tamales.</p>
<p>He sat glowing and glorified in the light of his admirers, young knights-errant hungry for the award money, for an internship, for a career, for a world they couldn‚Äôt yet imagine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGive me some of that healthy hacker food. I haven‚Äôt eaten since the rubber chicken last night.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo was out hobnobbin with the vice president.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI saw him almost complete a sentence. It was scary. Looks like [pg155] you hit some snow, Dan.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHad to put the chains on. The boys did, I mean. I just sat inside keepin warm. You get any comin north?</p>

<p>Sitting back on the sofa, arms crossed, eyes narrowed and shaded under the cap brim, the rhythm of travel still in his body was distracting him. He listened not for what they said but their saying of it. The dreams themselves were always puerile variations on the same themes: escape, power, revenge for injustice. He listened for how their voices handled, and how their minds harnessed these raw energies.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to build a starship. Get off the planet before we destroy it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBarry?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI guess I‚Äôm with Mike about the planet. But getting off it seems like, well, like it‚Äôs okay to use up this planet because we‚Äôll just get another.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUse it up how?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOverpopulation, pollution, resource depletion‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut Barry, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornucopian" title="Wikipedia: Cornucopian">population isn‚Äôt a problem</a>. When you increase the population you get more scientists, hence more solutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah Barry, going into space is all about environments, life support, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terraforming" title="Wikipedia: terraforming">terraforming</a>. I mean, it‚Äôs going to happen, so let‚Äôs get good at it.<a href="#fn83" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>‚Äìanyway the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carrying%20capacity" title="Wikipedia: carrying capacity">carrying capacity</a> of the planet [pg156]</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlanet‚Äôs here to be used, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚Äìanyway we won‚Äôt be able to get everyone off the planet, we can‚Äôt afford it. So who decides</p>
<p>‚ÄìMost people are just excess baggage, that‚Äôs what Hume thought.</p>
<p>‚Äìanyway why do we have to transport bodies? The important thing about humans is their intelligence, not their meat packages. You can move that software to a more durable chassis. See that‚Äôs what I want, backups, copies of myself, lots of instantiations, dozens of little Nate-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon%20%28computing%29" title="Wikipedia: Daemon (computing)">daemons</a> surfing the Net and doing science.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHey, if my instantiation can‚Äôt go climbing I don‚Äôt want it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah but see your daemon could be doing physics while you‚Äôre climbing, and if you had an accident it could keep on doing physics</p>
<p>‚ÄìHey Barry could be the first posthumous Nobel Prize winner. Or hey Barry, network your daemon to one of those Virtual Wilderness systems, let it solo the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiger" title="Wikipedia: Eiger">Eiger</a> while you‚Äôre</p>
<p>‚Äìdon‚Äôt want to knock human beings too much, but should we restrict ourselves to human intelligence? I have no special loyalty to DNA.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf a person is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational%20theory%20of%20mind" title="Wikipedia: Computational theory of mind">the pattern of their thought</a>, you can record and store that pattern. You could raise the dead. Resurrect Newton from the thoughts recorded in his works.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA composer friend of mine is doing exactly that. Creating new works by dead European white males. Beethoven‚Äôs Tenth and so forth.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWow, I‚Äôd like to talk to him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can make that happen.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut who decides who‚Äôs to be resurrected? You think we have an overpopulation problem now</p>
<p>‚ÄìBigger hard disks! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryder%27s%20Law" title="Wikipedia: Kryder's Law">Memory‚Äôs cheaper every day.</a></p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, the ones who haven‚Äôt contributed, who‚Äôve left no trace, there‚Äôs nothing to resurrect‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Logs burned to embers, confirming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%20of%20time" title="Wikipedia: Arrow of time">time‚Äôs arrow</a> even as Tom was saying, ‚ÄìTime machines are easy, you just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipler%20cylinder" title="Wikipedia: Tipler cylinder">spin ultradense matter until the continuum uncurves</a></p>
<p>‚Äìno but the matter you spin has to be infinitely long</p>
<p>‚Äìanyway once you have a working time machine you could</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, it‚Äôs gettin time. [pg157]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, Dan, I‚Äôll wrap it up. Why did I want to hear this stuff? I wanted to hear it because we deal in futures. If we‚Äôre smart enough and our ideas are good enough and we convince enough people to invest their time, their money, their talents, above all their belief, we can bring some of these futures into being. Nothing we‚Äôve said is really impossible, just difficult and expensive. I look at things from the point of view of some infinitely advanced civilization limited only by the laws of physics, not by lack of time or talent or funding. Only if you think that way do you have a chance of having the ideas that can truly advance civilization. Give you just one instance, Mike, you can use this for your starship. We‚Äôre close, very close, to breakeven from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inertial%20confinement%20fusion" title="Wikipedia: inertial confinement fusion">inertial confinement fusion</a>. We need more funding, better facilities, but it‚Äôs going to happen. And then there are no limits. Then mankind has all the cheap clean power it wants. And then we go to the stars, Mike.</p>
<p>A lozenge of light flashed across the ceiling, as Root‚Äôs thick fingers dropped a silver disk in a player for elegiac violins suspended over the hushed growl of cellos and an oboe melody. ‚ÄìLittle soundtrack. Could be the last time we get to see that needle jump.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLast time‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA hundred miles east of here in the desert we sometimes engage in highly classified events that cannot be discussed with the unsanctified. But whether or not those events are or aren‚Äôt happening, you can watch the seismograph, where you might see some effects, which are unclassified.</p>
<p>Grinning, Barry said, ‚ÄìBut can we trust the effects? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s%20three%20laws" title="Wikipedia: Clarke's three laws">Any sufficiently advanced technology</a> is indistinguishable from a rigged demo.</p>
<p>Highet gave him a sharp look. ‚ÄìBarry, we don‚Äôt even joke about that.</p>
<p>The needle traced a trembling path of ink on the turning drum. A baritone voice leapt and feinted to stretch the syllables of ‚ÄìKar‚Ä¶ frei‚Ä¶ tags‚Ä¶ zaub‚Ä¶ er<a href="#fn84" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a>. Then the needle leapt.</p>
<p>Yes. Spirit is loosed from rock, freed of matter‚Äôs tyranny. We open a crack through which light blazes, waking the life in every mote. Once more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura%20Mazda" title="Wikipedia: Ahura Mazda">Ahura Mazda</a>, the wise Lord, defeats <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahriman" title="Wikipedia: Ahriman">Ahriman</a>. A world without this radiance at the heart of things would be nulliparous<a href="#fn85" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a>, without man [pg158] or mind. Yet no life awakes save through human mind and will. In the wakened world, agents of will move and collide, cooperate or battle. The great work of consciousness is to form and direct alliances among the agents in oneself and in others, and so to perfect the world. To protect and nurture this spark in the sea of night.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is what it‚Äôs about, gentlemen. Bringing light into the world. Signing your name on a tongue of fire.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMan, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is it, Barry?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs maybe this is a bad time but I feel weird about this. I have kind of a problem with weapons work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh man‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome on Barry, give the man a break.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it‚Äôs okay. Barry, nobody‚Äôs going to make you work on weapons.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut to be in a place where</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen, for nineteen years Leonardo worked for the Duke of Milan. He was hired to design armaments. He also painted and sculpted. You think he fretted over that? Think the soul can split itself? Think you can have the Last Supper without the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek%20fire" title="Wikipedia: Greek fire">Greek fire</a>?<a href="#fn86" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The human spirit is fire. No light without heat.</p>
<p>Highet paced to the fireplace and drew back the steel curtain.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat if you wish away uranium. Set the initial conditions of the big bang so the particle soup‚Äôs less dense, you don‚Äôt get fast neutron capture, nothing heavier than bismuth forms. Nothing fissionable. Do you get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned%20Universe" title="Wikipedia: Fine-tuned Universe">life in that universe</a>? Do you get intelligence? I don‚Äôt think so. I think you get cold rocks spinning in a waste.<a href="#fn87" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>He picked up a log from the bin and tossed it on the low blaze.</p>
<p>‚ÄìReason has to be built, fought for, spread. You think knowledge always advances? For every Leonardo there‚Äôs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus" title="Wikipedia: Paracelsus">Paracelsus</a>. For every Mendel a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim%20Lysenko" title="Wikipedia: Trofim Lysenko">Lysenko</a>. Darkness follows our every step.</p>
<p>The log caught flame as air pulled past it and up the flue. He drew shut the curtain. ‚ÄìYou have to understand that it‚Äôs win or die out there. And if your ideas are good, you have a responsibility to put them into the world.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBarry, said Mike. ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt like the weapons stuff either. But I want to get to the stars. I don‚Äôt care whose back I do it on. They can [pg159] have their bombs if I get a fusion drive out of it.</p>
<p>What he owed these kids. To grind them in the mortar of necessity so that their talent, in the grinding, could emit its radiance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen to me. We‚Äôre just vessels. Science is a godly force that works through us. Honor the god wherever it appears, in yourselves, in others. Make friends an be loyal to them. Always stand up an speak your mind. Take up space, because timidity gets no respect, the meek inherit nothing. Make enemies by choice, not by accident. That‚Äôs my advice to you.</p>
<p>A bitter exaltation entered him, near enough to love for their bright faces admiring not him but what was in him, his joy embittered by the knowledge that he would not be there to see them through. Yet they would come to him, some of them, regardless.</p>
<p>‚ÄìY‚Äôall scat now. Leo and I got to talk. Downstairs there‚Äôs a game room, a billiard table, some workstations, and the ARIES collection of old tech. If you ever wanted to play Spacewar on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10" title="Wikipedia: PDP-10">PDP-10</a> now‚Äôs your chance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCool! as Root went with them to the stairway. The music had changed to a moody essay in winds and strings. Highet switched it off. When Root returned he carried a green bottle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laphroaig" title="Wikipedia: Laphroaig">Laphroaig</a> and two glasses. ‚ÄìBit over the top, weren‚Äôt you? That honor the god stuff.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt believe in God, Dan?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou want to be careful feeding that hunger.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt say.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre so concerned about rationality. About the light. Upset by Howie Bangerter and his know nothing creationists. But you know how many of your heroes were washed in the blood of the lamb? The great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph%20Priestley" title="Wikipedia: Joseph Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> wrote commentary on Revelations. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20Faraday" title="Wikipedia: Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> was a fundamentalist. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20Clerk%20Maxwell" title="Wikipedia: James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> wrote out daily prayers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou left out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Babbage" title="Wikipedia: Charles Babbage">Babbage</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac%20Newton%27s%20occult%20studies" title="Wikipedia: Isaac Newton's occult studies">Newton</a>. Different times, Dan. Protective coloring.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThing about God is, he ain‚Äôt around much, and it‚Äôs got to be someone looking out for the chickens.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt pour me any of that.</p>
<p>Root poured a glass for himself. ‚Äì<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rvsOkMa6KZgC&amp;pg=PA89" title="Coyote The Cheat">Coyote baptizes the chickens</a>, you know that story? [pg160]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWish you‚Äôd lay off the, the down home spunnisms.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSeems one day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote%20in%20mythology" title="Wikipedia: Coyote in mythology">Coyote</a> went calling on a hen. He says to her, these chicks of yours, they‚Äôre fine chicks, but why don‚Äôt you baptize them? Baptize, she says, what‚Äôs that? Says Coyote, Baptizing makes them big and strong, you leave it to me, and he takes one chick away. Next day he‚Äôs back, says, your chick‚Äôs doing real well, but he‚Äôs lonely. So Coyote takes another chick and</p>
<p>‚Äìeats them all, so what‚Äôs your point.</p>
<p>Root grinned. ‚ÄìYou do lead em on.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWithout a little religion they‚Äôll end up jarwipes in D Section. That <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habanos%20S.A." title="Wikipedia: Habanos S.A.">a Havana</a>?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt surely is. You want one?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGod no. Just wondered if you‚Äôre still supporting the corrupt regime.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLong as they keep rollin these on the thighs of virgins.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre a piece of work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%20a%20piece%20of%20work%20is%20a%20man" title="Wikipedia: What a piece of work is a man">how noble in reason</a>. Root turned the cigar slowly in the flame of a match, watching Highet as smoke rose. ‚ÄìHow‚Äôd it go in LA? How‚Äôs your mother?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDying.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry to hear that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìChrist, Leo, bite my head off why don‚Äôt you. Just tryin to be a decent human being.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt strain yourself.</p>
<p>Root studied him. ‚ÄìWhat happened?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm out, Dan. Out on my ass.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf I don‚Äôt resign, Chase says he‚Äôll prosecute.</p>
<p>‚ÄìProsecute!</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe won‚Äôt do it. But they let him say it. They let him say it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho they gone replace you with?</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine! The deputy associate. I warned you, Leo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôll regret it. He‚Äôs a pure fool.<a href="#fn88" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìGod looks out for them, I hear.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm glad God‚Äôs got work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, what the fuck, they can‚Äôt do that. They can‚Äôt raise him up like that. There‚Äôs a pecking order.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI gave him the Taliesin report to write, so he‚Äôs whistleblower of the hour. Every other candidate has deep roots in weapons, in Radiance. Quine looks clean to them, but not too clean since he‚Äôs been mucking in J Section. Maybe they think he knows where the bodies are buried. From their point of view it‚Äôs an easy sell, the new broom.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChase must have some regents by the balls. Well shit, the governor has to approve it, he‚Äôs still a Republican. You can fight this, Leo. It ain‚Äôt right.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre the one who said the regents are deserting us, Dan, think the governor‚Äôs going to second guess them on this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSomethin stinks here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChase is putting pressure, I don‚Äôt know how.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about that GAO report? Isn‚Äôt that auditor fellow Rector a friend? That could change some minds.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMonths, that‚Äôs months away.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou can hang tough that long. Did you talk to Bill Venham?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI asked Venham for help with the regents and he seated me with some schmuck who wants to patent multiplication.</p>
<p>Root smiled. ‚ÄìStan Flack. What‚Äôs Bill got to do with him?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, Bill‚Äôs got lots of interesting friends. Last I saw he was holding some Russian‚Äôs dick for him. Some ex-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apparatchik" title="Wikipedia: apparatchik">apparatchik</a> trying to sell the line that Uncle Julius was a Sov spy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOppenheimer? He was, he was. Who was this Russian?</p>
<p>‚ÄìVassili something. So, what, they suck up to some KGB thug just for a payback? Christ Dan, they reminded me of Stalin and Lysenko.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLysenko wasn‚Äôt so dumb. Got himself a sinecure.</p>
<p>Highet held out a folded page of light green vellum watermarked Cranes Crest Old Money, with ŒΩŒøœÖœÉ debossed over small widespaced type Nexus for Optimal Use of Science.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs your sinecure.</p>
<p>Root took the letter and read it. ‚ÄìThat‚Äôs a nice offer. You gone take it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSit with a bunch of burnouts writing white papers? How does [pg162] R√©ti stand them, those god damned consultants with their valet thinking?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNOUS is respectable.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUsed to be, before Venham stocked it with his used scientists his distressed intellectuals his right-thinking gigolos. Man has more money than God, but that‚Äôs not enough, is it, has to buy a think tank buy a broadcaster that stalkinghorse Eubanks on the radio, you ever listen to him? Ratfucker ought to be selling used cars or slinging insult comedy in a Tahoe lounge, but there he is chatting with good old Bill and the vice president.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCut it out, Leo, we owe Bill. Where‚Äôd this ranch come from? Think we‚Äôd have sold Radiance to the president without him?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou remember when Venham wanted me to start a section at the Lab for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/creation%20science" title="Wikipedia: creation science">creation science</a>?</p>
<p>Root chuckled. ‚ÄìYou coulda spun it to DOE as alternate paradigm research.</p>
<p>Highet‚Äôs mouth twisted. ‚ÄìChrist, you‚Äôre shameless. You‚Äôll say anything.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThink your man Leonardo didn‚Äôt have to hold his gorge every day?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre not talking Sforza here. Half these nonecks think the dinosaurs died in the Flood because they couldn‚Äôt fit on the Ark<a href="#fn89" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese are our allies, boy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre thugs, Dan. They‚Äôre enemies of reason.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCommon cause, Leo. You don‚Äôt have to share a pew with them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCommon cause? What cause?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPower, money, influence. Commonest causes there are. Who gives a shit what they believe?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou remember when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Shockley" title="Wikipedia: William Shockley">Schott</a> won his Nobel? A year later he was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Shockley%23Statements%20about%20populations%20and%20genetics" title="Wikipedia: William Shockley#Statements about populations and genetics">pushing master race eugenics</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat are you gettin at, Leo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust because you‚Äôre smart don‚Äôt think you can‚Äôt be stupid. Give them an inch and see what they take. Venham and his buds want to shut down DOE now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs just makin a point.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA <em>point</em>? What point, he and his cronies aren‚Äôt happy with [pg163] the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-plus%20contract" title="Wikipedia: Cost-plus contract">cost-plus contracting</a> deals they get now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe entire DOE budget‚Äôs what, seven billion? Chump change. Why suck a dry tit? Move the weapons to DoD where they belong, hand over the rest to the private sector. That‚Äôs their thinkin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you think DoD is that stupid? Don‚Äôt you remember that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff" title="Wikipedia: Joint Chiefs of Staff">joint chiefs</a> wanted no part of Radiance? Said it would never work, recommended against it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut they took the money now didn‚Äôt they?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe whole defense industry‚Äôs ready to implode Dan, you know that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSoviet Union imploded. Nice opportunity for some businessmen.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou talking about Vassili? What is he really, KGB or some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian%20mafia" title="Wikipedia: Russian mafia">Mafiya</a> goon?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt ask less I need to know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know, you can keep your business opportunities, Dan, because if all the nuclear programs go to DoD that‚Äôs the end of the Lab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome on, Leo. The players change, the game goes on. Anyway, since when you got any use for DOE? As I recall they put you into windmill design.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey did. And I learned how to play them. Learned how to get my people what they need. I‚Äôm not going to stand by while these thugs steal that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSee, this is why we set up Transfinite and Nullpoint, boy. Get ourselves paid even if the feds give it away.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI owe something to those kids downstairs.</p>
<p>Root snorted, then stood looking into the fire. The hand holding his cigar rested on the mantelpiece. ‚ÄìYou want my advice, Leo, you take R√©ti‚Äôs cue. Nothin wrong with consulting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThink I want to end up like R√©ti?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOne of the most powerful scientists in the world? I think you do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf it‚Äôs about science, Dan, R√©ti hasn‚Äôt done any since the War.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, it hasn‚Äôt been about science since the War, now has it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen what is it about? What do you get out of it, Dan?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMe? A good time. Son, there‚Äôs people out there write fat checks just to scratch an itch. Way you or me want a beer, they want a summer [pg164] house, a yacht, a nonprofit foundation. A fellow can live pretty good off the fallout. I don‚Äôt need to own a ranch myself when I got the run of this place.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome people call that leeching.</p>
<p>‚Äì‚ÄúMake to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.‚Äù<a href="#fn90" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> If it‚Äôs good enough for Our Lord‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìTurning devout, Dan?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDammit Leo, it‚Äôs our moral duty to skin these piggies. Capital‚Äôs like blood, it‚Äôs gotta flow. Like Leonardo, we can divert rivers, rivers of gold‚Ä¶ You remember that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTRAG" title="Wikipedia: OTRAG">German rocket company</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaire" title="Wikipedia: Zaire">Zaire</a>?

I might still be there if that consortium hadn‚Äôt gone broke. Still, we put a few items into orbit, yes we did.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs it, then? Smoke a good cigar, put a few items into orbit‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou think any of us gone win a Nobel Prize? Got something better, we do. Those thugs of yours, to them we‚Äôre wizards. Nuclear weapons, missile defense, cold fusion‚Ä¶ just say the magic words, and the vaults open. Oh, the world‚Äôs a wicked place, Leo, and freedom ain‚Äôt free. If you want freedom, somebody‚Äôs got to fuck a rat. So let the thugs do it. While we run free.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd science? Knowledge?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou think people want knowledge? Last thing they want. They don‚Äôt want to know. They want to be saved. And the only salvation‚Ä¶ is to forget. Without forgetting, there‚Äôs nothing but loss and regret.</p>
<p>A log fell and fire leapt in the grate. Ash swirled in the updraft. Root gazed as at the apparition of a thing long past hope, then shrugged and drew on his cigar.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnyway, what else you gone do? Tech physics at South Bunghole State?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe I‚Äôll disappear. Like the reclusive Devon Null. [pg165]</p>
<p>Root looked sharply up. ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want to hear that. Somebody has to take the heat. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre director, so there‚Äôs a scapegoat.</p>
<p>A gust swept moaning down the flue, and the fireplace spat sparks against the hanging metal curtain.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was bringing in a billion dollars a year, Dan. I though I was invulnerable. I let my guard down.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCrap, Leo, you‚Äôre the most guarded man I know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat else could I have done? I went as far as I could without killing Radiance outright. Call it dual use, counterproliferation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stockpile%20stewardship" title="Wikipedia: stockpile stewardship">stockpile stewardship</a>, just get it off the weapons menu. I‚Äôm tired of this shell game.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome on, son. Radiance isn‚Äôt dead. This stuff never dies, cause good soldiers like you and me keep the faith alive during these long winters. Don‚Äôt give up now. The players change, but the work goes on.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoes it? I mean shit Dan, what‚Äôs next, privatized missile defense‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>In the dying firelight Root‚Äôs face was stone. Woe, like wind in the flue, the merest tongue of a gale, stirred in Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat does Gate want with those orbiters, Dan?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLike the man said, he‚Äôs still lookin for a content provider.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShit, that‚Äôs it, isn‚Äôt it? Gate doesn‚Äôt want comm sats. Why, you son of a bitch. Seoul or Pyongyang, which is it?</p>
<p>Root studied his cigar. ‚ÄìAfraid you‚Äôre out of the loop on that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe players change.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, they do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSaw this coming, did you Dan? Made to yourself some friends?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake that job at NOUS. We‚Äôll do business again.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut for now you‚Äôll work with Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf he becomes director I got to, don‚Äôt I.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI warn you, Dan. Don‚Äôt do it.</p>
<p>Root looked up from his cigar, incredulity on his features. ‚ÄìYou <em>warn</em> me?</p>
<p>A pale face appeared in the stairway. ‚ÄìDoctor Highet? Doctor Root? There‚Äôs something on CNN you should see.</p>
<p>Downstairs the other students watched a missile chased to destruction while the nagging voice of Armand Steradian rode over, ‚Äìtest managers installed a homing beacon on the target to guide the interceptor [pg166] Undersecretary Whipple defended the rigged tests on grounds that the deception was part of a so-called special access program devoted to disinformation.</p>
<p>Whipple‚Äôs haggard face appeared. ‚ÄìAt that time there was no obligation to inform Congress. Of course Congress is now being informed of all special access progr</p>
<p>Film of the missile looped again. Into the room‚Äôs stricken silence Highet said, ‚ÄìAncient history. DoD ran those tests years ago<a href="#fn91" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a>. He‚Äôs trying to make this sound like it‚Äôs our doing.</p>
<p>‚Äìseries of scandals. The program‚Äôs centerpiece, the Superbright laser, is under criticism from without and within. An internal review is said to dispute the extravagant claims made by director Leo Hi</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat prick! I should never have talked to him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMeanwhile, Laboratory founder and antimissile proponent Aron R√©ti is in stable condition following a stroke.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh my god. Dan‚Äì!</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs news to me.</p>
<p>‚Äìperhaps the most controversial physicist of the twentieth</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome on, dimbulb, tell us the hospital.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLikely Stanford. Root unfolded a phone.</p>
<p>‚Äìfinancial interest in Transfinite Polygonics, a firm that has profited from technologies developed at the Lab, according to the General Accounting Off</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid Aron know about that GAO probe, Leo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe knew all right, knew it was without merit, but this publicity would have been a blow.</p>
<p>‚Äìfor CNN this is Armand Steradian</p>
<p>‚ÄìFucking vulture, I‚Äôll tear his heart out. Changed the channel, who else has it, skipping past, ‚ÄìRottweilers terrorize churchgoers at eleven, to a man holding a microphone before a gate where motley figures waved signs FRAUD WASTE STOP NOW as a red sports car SFORZA sped out of frame, ‚Äìaudit found widespread evidence of financial malfeasance and gross incompetence and concluded that the laboratory can no longer be trusted to police itself, cutting to a full face radiant in sun, dark eyes intense beneath black hair tinged with russet, ‚ÄìOur concern is [pg167]</p>
<p>‚ÄìTurn it off. Did you get the hospital?</p>
<p>Root closed his phone. ‚ÄìHe‚Äôs there. Stable. No calls. Visitors two to six tomorrow.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll go see him then.</p>
<p>Root‚Äôs heavy steps followed Highet upstairs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, it don‚Äôt rain but it shitstorms.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt was bound to break. Almost a relief it has.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs this about an internal review?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTold you, Quine‚Äôs report. Chase was waving a copy around this morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere‚Äôd he get it? From Quine?</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine hasn‚Äôt got the balls to leak</p>
<p>‚ÄìHad the balls to write it, didn‚Äôt he?</p>
<p>The plume still spreading, like the bitter miasma of Root‚Äôs breath now close on him, the glitter of his eyes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou said Quine was under control.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho am I, Dan, Rasputin?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs wrong with you, boy? Ain‚Äôt you learned yet? Root‚Äôs hand squeezed his shoulders. Highet shook them off.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, Dan? Learned what? How to stay ahead of every last asshole who wants a piece of me and sell out the ones who don‚Äôt?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow to manage your people!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho the fuck are <em>my people</em>, Dan? Quine? Dietz? Szabo? Venham and Eubanks? Mister Kim? You? I‚Äôd really like to know who the fuck <em>my people</em> are!</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake it easy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìScrew you. I‚Äôm going.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? Where?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTracy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, you mean Transfinite? You crazy? Six hour drive in the snow, you got chains?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll manage.</p>
<p>Root stood. His body moved between Highet and the door, the stub of his cigar held aloft. ‚ÄìWhat are you up to, Leo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAfraid you‚Äôre <em>out of the loop</em> on that Dan, turning for his jacket draped on the wallpeg. [pg168]</p>
<p>‚ÄìHold on, now hold on here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGot to get my resum√© together, don‚Äôt I? Chase gets his way Radiance is dead, Gate and Venham get their way everything‚Äôs for sale to the first bidder, Luz and that woman get their way we‚Äôre all out on the street with clappers and bells. So I‚Äôd better make to myself some friends. Better become a, what did Gate say, a content provider.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI got private papers there in Tracy.</p>
<p>Highet pulled his jacket on, adjusted the brim of <em>e=hf</em>. ‚ÄìI mean, fuck a rat, Dan, I need something to sell like everybody else, need to come out of this with a little <em>content</em>. Don‚Äôt want to end up hosting multimedia conventions or infomercials, don‚Äôt want to be left behind on Mike‚Äôs dying planet, do I.</p>
<p>Root‚Äôs big hands came up. Highet flinched from them, then held his ground. They closed around his head, the thick fingers cradled his skull, thumbs pressed painfully on the hinges of his jaw. Between two fingers the cigar stub smoldered. Smoke and heat brought tears to Highet‚Äôs eyes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt trust me Dan?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt you sell me out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that even possible?</p>
<p>Root‚Äôs grip tightened. He crooned, ‚ÄìDon‚Äôt you know that I love you like a son? Like you love those kids?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet go of me, Dan. You‚Äôre an asshole.</p>
<p>Slowly Root smiled. His breath stank. His teeth were yellowed and stained with tobacco. His gums were white and puffy. In the depths of his mouth gold gleamed. ‚ÄìThat‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm the asshole that shits on the world. Do you see the god in me? Do you honor it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI see it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? What do you see?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs in you‚Ä¶ is in me.</p>
<p>The grip relaxed. Highet stepped back. Root whispered, ‚ÄìGo you forward.</p>
<p>Past Carson City and CHAINS REQUIRED he climbed into cloud, as a voice battle drifts of static, ‚ÄìLord I knew that thou art a hard man<a href="#fn92" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a>, and flakes fell faster and thicker in the cones of light the car projected as it gained Elev 7120, where the voice returned, ‚Äìand cast ye [pg169] the unprofitable servant into outer dark, the road now white in his headlights as he downshifted and skidded sideways, static on the radio like a held breath as he straightened and snow clumped to be swept away by groaning wipers down past Elev 6000 at last to be plowed and glistening black streets reflecting the neon glare of casinos and motels, the voice rising urgently out of static, ‚Äìin mankind‚Äôs darkest days my friends? God‚Äôs Word tells us that one generation of believers will never know death, but they will be lifted from the earth in a rapture before the great tribulation, before the end time, before that ghastly epoch of pestilence and famine and the fire and the blood. When the fire falls, where will you be my friends? Will you be lifted from the Earth to meet your Lord and Master Jesus Christ in eternal life, or will you drown in the blood and burn in the flood of the nucular fire and starve with the sinners and the unbelievers in the great tribul, and he punched to a familiar nasal voice ‚Äìwell Terry, I think it makes a statement, converting military technologies for cultural uses. In my Concerto for Horn and Electrified Conductor the artificial intelligence actually composes an accompaniment as the conductor beats off, silencing it as the road dropped into chaparral, an further down the slope cities on the ancient seabed sent their light up to a heaven stained with thinning cloud no longer dampening the highway or the potholed access road to DA-NITE SELF-STOR 24 HRS, behind razorwire and lights stark as low suns on some lunar horizon. He rolled to a stop at a stanchion and punched the keypad 3 1 4 1 6 # for the gate rolling open on an alley between corrugated tin walls dull in the lunar light, until, stilling the car near a scuffed door, he stepped out into the humid stench of chemicals from a nearby slough and the freeway‚Äôs whine just over a concrete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise%20barrier" title="Wikipedia: Noise barrier">soundwall</a>, above which the sky was a dark void where an unseen jet passed screaming between landfalls.</p>
<p>Upstairs was a warren of corridors. At each turn was a black plastic wedge POISON on the floor, gray pellets in its recesses. At 211 he hefted the padlock in its hasp and inserted a cylindrical key. He threw a switch and a bare bulb in a wire cage came on overhead to light a narrow walkspace between cartons stacked to the ceiling, AR-KIV, STOR-ALL, DESTROY AFTER, BERING GREY RIESLING, and hasty scribbles in black marker, <sub><del>Transfinite</del></sub> Nullpoint, <sub><del>Baldur</del></sub> Slingshot, LHH Personal, LHH Papers, DR, HR, boxes seamsplit and overflowing with xeroxes, printouts, books and manuals stuffed into the gaps between them, Rings Fields and Groups, Numerical Methods in Ratfor, How To Sell Your Ideas, Notebooks of Leonardo<a href="#fn93" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a>, on across the floor to a spill of procurement documents, patent applications, source code printouts, spools of data tape, boxes of floppy disks, notebooks, conference proceedings, advisory reports, expired radiation badges, cassettes of R√©ti‚Äôs speeches, fundraiser menus (veal marsala, pur√©e of winter roots, braised Belgian endive, 1975 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon), minutes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L5%20Society" title="Wikipedia: L5 Society">L5 Society</a> meetings, drawings of space stations and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/railguns" title="Wikipedia: railguns">railguns</a>, a plan for using subways as civil defense shelters, a plan for using nuclear bombs to dig canals and harbors, a plan for spaceships propelled by fusion bombs, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology" title="Wikipedia: Nanotechnology">machines the size of molecules</a> (with and without sex organs), for machines that travel faster than light and machines that travel through time, for psychokinesis and communication with the dead, plans for the endless mortgaging of an untenable present to finance an impossible future, all to answer the night‚Äôs secret hope, untempered by experience, that morning will bring renewal, though morning has never renewed anything but yesterday‚Äôs conflict and chaos where it left off.</p>
<p>Light glinted in a recess from the green of Laphroaig, which he grasped, brushing off cobwebs to unscrew the cap, tipping it to his mouth, then resting it among the detritus on the floor as he pulled down boxes one after another to look for a salvation not in forgetting the painful conviction of what one might have been or had meant to be, but in the hard coin of what one has become.</p>
<p>LHH Personal. Record of every accomplishment and debacle. Here was the transcript of the hearing after Geneva. Here was the official reprimand and reassignment, and the letter from R√©ti that had saved him from dismissal. Here were dossiers on each of his Hertz recruits, and documents from J Section as it grew. Stubs of paychecks at each new salary level. Clippings announcing his directorship. The President‚Äôs speech of commitment to Radiance. and here, out of order, was the dossier he‚Äôd assembled on Quine for the Hertz board during the first days of J Section. Here was the paper that first brought Quine to [pg171] his attention. A wave/particle experiment with original insights and meticulous design. What R√©ti had said: ‚ÄìThis is first rate. This shows real imagination.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, you can pick them all right, Highet muttered, pushing aside the opened box to make room for <sub><del>Transfinite</del></sub> Nullpoint. Salvage part of it at least. Throw a bone to the GAO and get Chase off the trail. That hint about shell companies. How much does he know? Come out of it with a clean bill for Transfinite and Nullpoint. All the rest, all the Lab business, the EIS, Credne, the plume, the investigations, can go hang. Leave some surprises for Quine. See how he likes it.</p>
<p>He sat on the floor among the boxes. He found a clean folder and plucking a pen from his pocket wrote on its tongue Transfinite Systems: Technology Transfers. He began to sort pages, the damaging from the damning. Root and his schemes. Supposed to make us all rich. Help our employees. Doing well by doing good. Never should have listened to him. Into the folder went a waiver of commercial rights to a wind turbine design. Never saw a dime from it, the wind power market just died. Back into the chaos of unsorted papers went a transfer of laser technology to a retiring employee represented by Transfinite. That blue-green laser the Navy wanted, we moved it outside the Lab into a spinoff and all we got out of it was an investigation<a href="#fn94" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a>. R√©ti bought their stock, the Times got wind of it, he didn‚Äôt speak to me for months. Into the folder went 3D modeling software given to a motor company. Back into outer dark went a computer architecture, developed at the Lab and released to Transfinite, that had made a Hertz kid rich when it was sold back to the Lab by Quick Data Systems, the kid‚Äôs new employer.<a href="#fn95" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> No good deed. So it went until the folder was a sheaf, and the level of Laphroaig had dropped by half, and he replaced the pen in his shirt pocket.</p>
<p>First rate. Shows real imagination. Who‚Äôd ever said the same of him? He pulled down LHH Papers, the record of his own life in science, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alembic" title="Wikipedia: alembic">alembic</a> in which all baseness was to be redeemed, all impurity to drop out like precipitate, leaving knowledge pure. Yet it seemed now, as he turned those pages, tipping Laphroaig to his mouth, hemmed in by AR-KIV STOR-ALL DESTROY BY, that these papers, [pg172] whether they proposed weapons or defenses, fantasies or fixes, no matter how technically sweet their arguments, were all made for trade rather than for truth, were made for the trade in truth.</p>
<p>The rising bile of pity and loathing for the life and work so baldly laid out there before him was arrested by <a href="http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/Sharp/HIF_documents/Nuckolls-laser%20fusion.sep72.pdf" title="'Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR)', Nuckolls et al 1972">Laser Compression Of Matter For Thermonuclear Fusion</a>. 1974.

When he was the Lab‚Äôs newest wunderkind. The old man would drop an idea, a hint, and he‚Äôd work all night on it. The whole thing took months. Here it was, boiled down to three pages in Physical Review Letters. He read it through. A certain amount of handwaving, of course. The full paper was twenty pages, but it couldn‚Äôt be published, too much of the material was classified. What was here was a fan dance for a presumed audience of nonclassified fusion scientists, Soviets, and US funding sources. The full paper was more exigent, and at this remove he could barely follow the reasoning through its pages, but he turned to the crux it had taken him a month to work out. Yes. Light pressure and momentum flux got you just so far. Much higher pressures could be generated by shaped laser pulses, by imploding the fuel sphere and ablating the outer layers like rocket exhaust. Szabo and he had written computer codes to simulate the process. Those cranky old mainframes. The all-night runs of data. The shortcuts and hacks. Tweak and squeak. But they got there. They showed you could start a breakeven thermonuclear burn with only a thousand joules of energy. In theory. It was brilliant. Better than Quine. Not just the science, but the implications. Fusion power. Pure fusion weapons without fission triggers. Best of all, they could build it. The vaults would open to them.</p>
<p>They did. They built <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva%20laser" title="Wikipedia: Shiva laser">it, the world‚Äôs most powerful laser</a>. But the fusion experiment failed. They rewrote the simulation codes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova%20laser" title="Wikipedia: Nova laser">raised their estimate of the power needed, raised it again</a>, got more funding. The laser program took on its own life, as more and more powerful and expensive machines passed in succession, but by then Highet had moved on, become a group leader, a section chief, was more and more abstracted from the work that had started it all for him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìStill, some damn clever stuff here, paging faster through the rest of the box, ‚Äìyes, we put a few items into orbit, rising unsteadily [pg173] to deal a vicious kick to the lowest box in a stack ‚Äìfuck! that crumpled it, ‚Äìa! and brought down the boxes above it, ‚Äìrat! bursting like a leafstorm across the floor, and knocked him to one bruised knee scooping papers wildly with both arms. ‚ÄìBut isn‚Äôt this what they want?

<p>He dabbed at the moisture at his chest. On his shirtfront ‚ÄìDamn! a black stain had spread, and he plucked out the pen, flipped it away, its gold point glinting as it spun upwards end over end toward the globe of the light<a href="#fn99" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a>, the tip slipping through the wire cage to penetrate the bulb which with a last flash went dark. He subsided then onto the papers, curling up where enough light yet sifted through a mesh transom to guide his hand to buttons on his watch, sifted and fell across the progress of digits and the beep on his wrist chasing off dream images of the beep from defensive consoles tracking the beep of enemies approaching the beep silenced by his finger on watch, showing 7:00 in segments swallowed inexorably by 7:01 as he sat up coughing in the miasma of dust and ammonia.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPull yourself together, he told himself. Mucus and vomit had dried on his swollen face. He wiped at the crust. He set empty Laphroaig into a recess and crumpled to a wad Inflatable, Perpetual, Dark. He opened the neat folder Transfinite and in the cubicle‚Äôs halflight doublechecked its pages, finding much that tantalized but nothing that damned. At last he closed it and went limping into the gathering predawn, under harsh lights raking a truck where two men rolled a cart loaded with canisters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichlorodifluoromethane" title="Wikipedia: Dichlorodifluoromethane">Dichlorodifluoromethane</a> CFC-12 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freon" title="Wikipedia: Freon">Freon</a> and looked up in furtive alarm<a href="#fn100" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> at the yelp from the red sports car SFORZA soon joining the dawn traffic already thickening past sumps and leaching pools and industrial waste ponds, one car among thousands streaming in lines twined like the involute treachery of the heart across flat empty land as infecund as it was interminable, this procession climbing more slowly to where wind whipped past turbines and tore apart the morning fog at Anabase Pass Elev 1835, and far off in the valley below, at the edge of town, diminished by distance, the fortress city of the Lab stood as ever, adumbrating some new frontier.</p>
<p>Descending toward it, Highet opened his phone and arrowed to RECTOR J. ‚ÄìJeremy? Leo Highet. Hope I‚Äôm not calling too early. I have some papers to help you clear up this Transfinite Polygonics business. You free for brunch? Good. Dim sum place in Mountain [pg175] View, I‚Äôll give you the address.</p>

I met the vice president, and on past Data General, Versant, Failure Analysis Associates, tapping brakes at a small black billboard in white Futura italic DISTRACT US FROM WHAT WE KNOW as the voice rolled on, ‚Äìheh, not running or President, you people can just forget about that, although you know, if I <em>did</em> run, I <em>would</em> win, Highet muttering, ‚Äìdon‚Äôt agree with everything he says but he makes some god damned good points, swerving up the offramp where he jammed brakes to join two lanes merging beneath a stand of acacias, rolling the window shut despite his own stink against the yellow blooms tossed in a warm and fragrant breeze, again punching A/C MAX, as the radio informed him, ‚ÄìSomething exciting is going on in America‚Äôs bathrooms, and he unzipped the garment bag with one hand for the electric razor humming against his jaws as he joined the six lane thoroughfare and cut across two lanes of complexity to SOON YET where a black Infiniti pulled past him into the last free parking space, DISABLED PARKING ONLY, its driving setting a blue and white plaque on the dashboard before slamming the door and walking smartly away.</p>
<p>He found an unmarked space near the garbage dumpsters, checked his watch against the savings and loan 10:32 84F 29C, and walked in the richness of his own stink to Open Visa Mastercard Push, pausing in the crowded foyer to flag down an impassive Chinese and press into his hand a folded bill, ‚ÄìTable for two in about ten minutes, going on down a narrow hall past a potted ficus into the men‚Äôs room where a mirror set upon mauve and avocado tile showed him a face stunned and swollen. Pushing open a stall he lowered the toilet lid and placed his folder and clean shirt on it, removed his jacket and slung it over the open door, noting a deep black stain on the lining, and, turning back to the mirror, seeing its duplicate on his shirt pocket. He stripped off the [pg177] shirt and the t-shirt with its own copy of the stain, the reek of his unwashed flesh rising, and stuffed both shirts into the trash bin below the empty paper towel dispenser, grabbing from the stall a roll of thin gray toilet paper, banging the tap to release a flow of water that every few seconds pinched off until he banged again, wetting gray wads of paper in the sporadic flow to scrub futilely at the stained flesh over his heart as he pumped the spigot of the soap dispenser yielding nothing, then rubbed his wet hands over its scummed chrome surface as if petitioning a miracle, and with the thin lather thus coaxed laved his face, chest, underarms, holding the tap with one elbow while rinsing with both hands. Toilet paper pilled in his body hair as he scrubbed and patted dry his arms, sides, and torso, its shreds floating in a basin of cloudy gray water. He shook open the folded shirt and pulled it on. The jacket smelled not too bad. He straightened its lapels and ran a wet hand through his thinning and awry hair, turning away from the pools of water on the floor, the wads clogging the basin, the scraps on the mirror, to reenter the dining room where a young man in blue pinstripe stood, scanning the room.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJeremy! There you are, offering a wet hand, ‚ÄìPardon my, some slob messed up the men‚Äôs room, no towels left. Here‚Äôs our table, following the impassive Chinese to a corner where at once a cart rolled up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPull up a pew, Jeremy. He‚Äôll have two of these and two of these.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, what‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese are duck‚Äôs feet, and this is parchment wrapped chicken.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUh‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôll love them. Now, I brought all the documents I could find relating to Transfinite Polygonics. You‚Äôre right that R√©ti holds an interest, but it doesn‚Äôt amount to much, a few patents about to expire, nothing that ever came to market. Company‚Äôs been inactive for many years.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, may I? reaching for the folder. Highet‚Äôs hand remained on it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know that Doctor R√©ti‚Äôs in the hospital?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI heard something about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm on my way to see him. Jeremy, I‚Äôm convinced that the publicity of this thing brought on his stroke. He‚Äôs a gentleman of the old school, he can‚Äôt stand publicity. Anything you can do to keep this out [pg178] of the press‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI assure you that I don‚Äôt talk to reporters, Rector said coolly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt. Ever have duck‚Äôs feet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I‚Ä¶ and while Rector‚Äôs attention was on the plates, Highet slid the folder across and removed his hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôll see a couple items in here that might be poor judgement, but nothing illegal, I think. It‚Äôs an interesting field, intellectual property. Did you know that in ‚Äô34 Szilard tried to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3_Szil%C3%A1rd#Developing_the_idea_of_the_nuclear_chain_reaction">patent the nuclear chain reaction</a><a href="#fn102" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a>?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll look at this later, tucking it under the Ohlone Valley Herald open on the table, where Highet read as Rector watched him read, Lab Consultants Charged With Fraud, Audit Reveals Contract Abuses, ‚ÄìYou do have your share of troubles. I saw on the news last night</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know, there‚Äôs lies, damn lies, and CNN. With these witch hunts going on, I can barely do my job. I‚Äôm thinking of resigning. R√©ti‚Äôs stroke made me realize, life is too short. We never know. At any moment, and Highet snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, well, I understand. Of course these new charges don‚Äôt bear on my investigation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm impressed by your thoroughness, Jeremy. By the time this business is over you‚Äôll know more about the Lab than I know myself. Have you ever thought about leaving civil service?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, you know, the benefits, the security‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìMay I ask how much you make?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou should look at our job descriptions for management analysts. Salary starts at fifty k. Maybe more for somebody with your experience. We‚Äôre always looking. We could expedite it, get it done within the month.</p>
<p>‚ÄìReally? Of course the timing, the appearance of improp</p>
<p>A momentary hish fell on the room, and then a short sharp shock rattled crockery, rippled water in glasses, and set overhead lights swaying. In its wake was a second of silence, and then, outside, car alarms ignited in periodic blasts of horn, sirens ramping up and sweeping down, a buzzing and warbling complexity on the edge of chaos, as conversation tentatively resumed and phones were unfolded and some [pg179] patrons rose and went out into the lot as Jeremy Rector closely examined a duck‚Äôs foot, saying, ‚ÄìI‚Äôll give your offer some thought.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTry the parchment wrapped chicken, no, unwrap it first‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The work goes on. The great work goes on.</p>

<p>Beneath the jet, as it dropped like a raptor in a thunder of falling glissandi through low clouds, the line of the bridge divided baywater scuffed by chop and the wakes of sailboats near the far shore, where salt leaching ponds fit one into the next like puzzle pieces of greenstone and jade and cinnabar slipping from sight as the jet closed on whitecaps spraying a verge of crushed rock. Then the sudden blur of runway. The jet touched, bounced settled, reversed engines with a roar. Quine reached under the seat for his case. When he came up the window framed a view of identical houses on the flanks of brown hills, dissolving the charm of distance into the rude immediacy of the mundane. The jet halted. Eyes shut, Quine waited for the aisle to clear, then stood and reached his suitcase from the overhead. Stale air dispersed as California winter, only slightly cooler an mixed with exhaust, made its tentative way in past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks" title="Wikipedia: Starbucks">Starbucks</a> and Simply Books and NewsPort into the open cavern of a men‚Äôs room, where Quine surprised in the mirror a pale and distressful face hard to call his own yet undeniably familiar from some other place and time. He set both cases between his feet, held his hands under a tap, splashed his face, turned to an empty towel dispenser.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPaging American passenger? J? Powers? Please report to the information desk, where a sliding conveyor doubled his walking speed to Ground Transportation -&gt; and through sliding glass doors to the roundabout where BayPorter was cutting off Avis Shuttle before ramming the back of Mount Extreme Vacation Bible School. A white [pg184] sedan E108637 came forward with Conor leaning across the passenger seat to open the door DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICIAL USE ONLY.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPerfect timing, said Conor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry to spoil your morning. Quine handed in his larger case and Conor wrestled it over the seat into the back as Quine sat and fumbled for the belt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo problemo, jefe. I exist to serve.</p>
<p>A whitegloved policeman waved them around BayPorter and Mount Extreme where a short dark man in a turban and beard gestured and argued with a stolid white man in a black suit and tie.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou look tired.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGot up at four to catch the flight.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSleep on the plane?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot really.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo how‚Äôd it go? Are we still open?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFor a while. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick%20Cheney" title="Wikipedia: Dick Cheney">The secretary</a>‚Äôs setting up a task force.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you think that means?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI really can‚Äôt say.</p>
<p>Conor‚Äôs hand moved to the radio for ‚Äìwhen there is a clamor across the land, who turns a tin ear? My friends, libberuls may ask for equal time, but I, Tuck Eubanks, <em>am</em> equal time</p>
<p>‚ÄìConor, do we have to listen to this, this idiot?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry, jefe. Just trying to get the traffic.</p>
<p>Quine half closed his eyes. Leaving the airport they drove through a maze of construction. Ramps ended in air. Cranes and gantries surrounded concrete pylons crowed with rebar. Through his drowsiness the world came and went harmlessly. Failure Analysis Associates, Informix, Hexcel, Data General, Versant. RAGS2AU. They sped up the approach to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San%20Mateo-Hayward%20Bridge" title="Wikipedia: San Mateo-Hayward Bridge">the bridge</a>, named after that gospeller who recounted the parable of the talents. A faint smell of burning, remote and dry, as if something beneath the surface of the world smoldered.</p>
<p>Inertia woke him as the car turned. Past Codornic s EXIT NLY, the hills were green at last with the first winter rains, fresh growth vivid almost to tenderness over the blackened memory of last summer‚Äôs burns, cut by a sudden lattice of steel beams and open floors, the shell [pg185] of an office building gone up since last he‚Äôd looked, extending the hegemony of the former outliers AmeriSuites Efficiency Studios Opening Soon and R G L C N M S M X. Then the Lab lay ahead of them like a city on the plain, some new Atlantis fenced by TRESPASSING LOITERING Forbidden By Law California Penal Code 602. They drove more slowly past the half mile of chainlink and razorwire to the west gate. Conor slowed for the security check, slowed again for the inner checkpoint, and parked at Building 101, dull under sunlight now hazed by high cloud and a wind out of nowhere that cut through Quine‚Äôs jacket as he opened the car door.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBy the way, your car‚Äôs in your space.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, you picked it up, thank you. Did they fix the CD player?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, they said you‚Äôd have to take it to the installer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut the last owner‚Ä¶ oh, never mind. Thanks for the ride. Listen, can you‚Ä¶ and a muffled boom from somewhere beyond a chainlink fence CREDNE CONSTRUCTION jolted him, ‚Äìcan you stop by later and take a look at my computer? It‚Äôs crashing a lot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure thing, jefe. Around six?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm going to try to leave early. Call me around three.</p>
<p>As he went through the door he caught a glimpse of a figure moving deep in glass, carrying a case, his stride fast yet unbalanced, as if he might at any moment veer in a new direction. Not a calm cell in that body. That baffled fury in his stride. He went through the entranceway in exaggerated haste and preoccupation, past a couple of faces he knew and several he didn‚Äôt. A poor photo of him appeared each month over the Director‚Äôs News column in Century 21, but few of the Lab‚Äôs employees, he hoped, paid enough attention to spot him in the hallways. Still his guard was up until he reached the fifth floor and entered the outer office where an orotund voice declaimed, ‚Äìthese people are nothing but a bunch of pebiscites! and was cut off a moment ahead of his ‚ÄìDolores would you pl</p>
<p>‚ÄìCalls from Paul Zalman of aXon Computer, Senator Chase‚Äôs office, Lynn Hamlin of CANT, and Frank Szabo. Orrin Gate will be a half hour later for his two o‚Äôclock. Jeremy Rector wants an appointment. Armand Steradian from PBS wants you to call him. And Doctor R√©ti wants to see you in his office. [pg186]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, is he here today? I thought he was in, in</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs back early.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I don‚Äôt have time today, Dolores. Tell him, is he here tomorrow?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, tomorrow and the next day he‚Äôs at NOUS. Then next week he‚Äôs in Washington.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôll have to be after that. I‚Äôll see Szabo at the meeting. Chase, that was his office?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs right.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay thanks, and get me Rector‚Äôs personnel file, will you? I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ leaving unspoken just what he intended as he passed to the inner office, dropping his suitcase on a bare expanse of carpet between bare walls keeping their distance from a nearly bare desk where he paused to open his case and draw from it a sheaf of papers and a yellow legal pad, pages turned back. The suave startup chord of the computer ushered him into the bathroom where he stood for several seconds with eyes shut, hands on sink, breathing deeply. He turned a tap and let it run, raising his eyes to a face not wholly unfamiliar, but still suspicious and fearful of what it might fin there. Opening the mirror, he reached for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.%C2%A0John%27s%20Wort" title="Wikipedia: St.¬†John‚Äôs Wort">St.¬†John‚Äôs Wort</a> Extract, shook out two capsules, filled a cup, swallowed, did the same with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo%20Biloba" title="Wikipedia: Ginkgo Biloba">Ginkgo Biloba</a>, then shut off the tap. Water stood in the basin inches deep and the drain gurgled once.</p>
<p>At his desk he tapped a computer key, then opened his case, frowning at the papers there. From outside came a din of construction, a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tattoo#Noun_2">tattoo</a> of warning beeps, a wail like lamentation. Quine turned to stare through polarized glass down on earthmovers, any one of which deployed the power of a pharaoh and all his slaves, roaring and lurching with a purpose hard to discern over pale rutted terrain, in the middle of which the cab of a crane pivoted slowly, its derrick level with him, a chain reaching from its apex almost to the ground where a thick metal plate swung and rotated as the chain wailed. Workers waved the plate over an excavation in which lay cylindrical tanks stenciled COMPOSIT PLASTEEL CONTAINMENT DO NOT. One side of the plate came to rest against the ground and the wailing ceased. The workers stepped back and the plate dropped to earth with a boom Quine felt in his feet. He yanked a cord and blinds fell rattling, cutting [pg187] off his view of the pit, the crane, and the mauve and avocado facade of the new building opposite, completed but not yet occupied.</p>
<p>He lifted the phone, punched 0 0 0 1 #, then 1 2 3 4 #, for ‚ÄìYou have, twelve, new messages. He listened through them without expression, occasionally making a note on his pad, until reaching the cool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contralto" title="Wikipedia: contralto">contralto</a> of ‚ÄìPhilip. It‚Äôs me. Welcome back. Will I see you tonight? Call me.</p>
<p>Turning to the computer he scanned his e-mail, the trace of a smile on his face giving ground to trepidation at</p>

<p>Still standing, he paged through his address book, slowing raising the handset to his ear only to hear voice already in converse, ‚Äìso he says, trust but verify, ‚Äìoh, his wife‚Äôs having an affair, tapping the hook for another line and ‚Äìllo? Who‚Äôs, tapping once more for ‚ÄìDolores? Are we having phone problems again? Can you get me an outside line?</p>
<p>‚Äìnot sure of himself</p>
<p>‚Äìwon‚Äôt last long you can be sure</p>
<p>Slamming down the phone, face reddened by something he could barely name, he drew from his case another sheaf of papers, looked at them briefly, pushed them aside and lifted the phone again. He dialed and waited through two rings for ‚ÄìNexus for Optimal Use of Science. How may I direct your call?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo Highet please.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMay I say who‚Äôs calling?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOne moment.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. The wall clock. The papers before him. Staff meeting at noon. Make sure you know everyone‚Äôs name.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet is not in his office. Would you like his voicemail?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, and he tapped the hook for a new dial tone and touched [pg188] MEM 1, turning to face the window, his expression gradually softening as he waited through four rings.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is Lynn Hamlin. I‚Äôm not at home right now, but if you‚Äôll</p>
<p>He tapped MEM 2 and waited. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôve reached the offices of Citizens Against Nuclear Technology. If you know your party‚Äôs, punching 303 for ‚ÄìLynn Hamlin. Is not in her office. Please</p>
<p>He replaced the handset and sat down, scanning the pages before him. Core competencies of the Laboratory. Our mission in a post-Cold War. Execute in accordance with best business practices. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix%20management" title="Wikipedia: Matrix management">Matrix management</a>. Successful integration of spirit, marketplace, and politics. He paused now and then to mark something with a highlighter, staring past the inscrutable words, as if meaning resided literally between the lines. He glanced at the computer, and reached to swing the mouse, causing the speaker to chime as the sailing cursor froze despite his jiggling hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh for, lifting the phone and pressing 2666 for</p>

<p>He dropped the phone into its cradle, glanced at his watch, an swept papers into his case, rushing out past ‚Äìsomething called capitalism which has as its divine right something called supply and demand, his stride down the hall fast yet unbalanced, slowing at a corridor to veer in a new direction up to E-501 WET PAINT where the door was shut and the knob with all the equanimity of the inanimate frustrated all his trials, until he saw taped to the wall Staff Meeting In E-533 and went more quickly down the hall glancing at his watch, turning left at E-525 full tilt to a corner where he slowed in confusion at a silver sign E-530 -&gt; which he followed to another turning, slowed [pg189] at E-550, turned again, and burst finally into E0533 where a waspish voice, ‚Äìthought I‚Äôd leave it out, fell abruptly silent.</p>
<p>Ten of them at the long table. Deputy and associate directors, group leaders, every one with more seniority than he had. Taking it for granted that he would last a year at most. As he sat he gripped the table. On the underside wood veneer gave way to some rough composite of sawdust and plastic. Frank Szabo sat beside him with a yellow legal pad and a styrofoam box.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry I‚Äôm, didn‚Äôt know the other room was. How‚Äôs everyone?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMorning Phil, came Szabo‚Äôs waspish voice. ‚ÄìGood flight?</p>

<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs awfully cold in here. Is there some reason the air conditioning‚Äôs on in the middle of winter?</p>

<p>Szabo shrugged. ‚ÄìI could call physical plant.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWould you please?</p>
<p>Again Szabo shrugged, took out a phone and unfolded it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay. I know you‚Äôre all curious so I‚Äôll get right to it. I met with the secretary. I met with unders and deputies and assistants. You remember Reese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbot" title="Wikipedia: Turbot">Turbot</a>, he was here through ninety-one, he‚Äôs now under for DP, defense programs, so we have an advocate there.

<p>‚ÄìThank you Frank. So I presented all your concerns. I think I put across our ah core competencies. I acknowledged that in light of some ah past problems we need a better management model. I said we‚Äôre committed to, to executing in accordance with best business practices to serve DOE‚Äôs customers who are of course the President and the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA corporate management model? You really think that works for us? [pg190]</p>
<p>‚ÄìArn, the secretary is setting up a commission. They have a year to write a report on the future of all the government labs. There are corporate people on the commission. The secretary comes from that world. We have to act as if we‚Äôre listening.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre we?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes we are, Bill. Because the alternative could be disastrous. So our immediate mission is, let me just‚Ä¶ shifting papers on the table before him and trying to focus not on the words or their evaded implications but on the yellow highlighter marks, ‚Äì‚Äúto assure the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of underground testing‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAbsence of testing?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe upcoming series of fifteen tests is canceled.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCanceled? And you went along with this, Phil?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt wasn‚Äôt up for discussion, Frank.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut Phil, you‚Äôre supposed to look out for our interests. You‚Äôre supposed to make it a discussion.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShe‚Äôd already talked to the joint chiefs. They agreed the series was unnecessary. The administration wants a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive%20Nuclear-Test-Ban%20Treaty" title="Wikipedia: Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty">comprehensive test ban treaty</a>. Talks start in Geneva this month, and testing would jeopardize that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe employ three thousand people out at Aguas Secas.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNobody wants to close the site. Subcritical tests are still on the menu, pending the treaty.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGive up testing, I do not believe this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, we‚Äôre already not testing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen Leo was here</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo‚Äôs not here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, he sure isn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt understand the situation. You should see the bills being introduced in Congress. Cut our workforce by one third. Close us down entirely. Eliminate the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll of that is such pardon me Phil bullshit. Do the rest of you remember the video DOE sent when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazel%20R.%20O%27Leary" title="Wikipedia: Hazel R.

What she said? ‚ÄúThe most important challenge facing the Lab in the coming decade is diversity.‚Äù Ten thousand nukes loose in the former Soviet [pg191] Union, proliferation in rogue states around the globe, decaying warheads in our stockpile, but first things first: hire more Hispanics.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell what do you expect she used to be a utility exec</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, now look</p>
<p>‚Äìtake anything she says seriou</p>
<p>‚Äìever get a real scientist in that office</p>

<p>‚Äìguess now we‚Äôre in the elder care business</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll right! Let‚Äôs cut the, cut to the, I mean we‚Äôve got a lot to do here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy point, Phil, is that our destiny is in our own hands, and these proposals from these out of touch jerkoffs don‚Äôt mean squat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm telling you what we have to work with. They understand the difficulty of doing this without testing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo they understand the difficulty of certifying new designs without testing?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere are to be no new designs.</p>

<p>‚ÄìSupreme national interest means this statement is operative until it‚Äôs not.<a href="#fn103" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìSo frank, you‚Äôre saying that DOE is holding open an option to design new weapons, and any assertion to the contrary is just public information.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought you talked to Reese.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe told me no new weapons.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot the same thing as no new designs. Okay, so we can‚Äôt test. What can we do?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnything sort of a chain reaction. Subcritical burns. Hydronuclear tests. Henry?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs some debate whether those will be allowed under the [pg192] proposed treaty. Some countries are insisting on a zero-yield definition. They say anything using nuclear materials is a nuclear test.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, that‚Äôs just foolish. No way we‚Äôre giving up hydronuclear.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, please‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs a matter for the treaty negotiators.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe hell it is.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust what does that mean, ‚Äúsafety and reliability‚Äù?</p>
<p>again his eyes sought highlighter marks as he paged forward to, ‚Äì<a href="http://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/bluebooks/2001/asci.html" title="Information Technology: 21 Century Revolution; DOE's ASCI Program">‚Äúassurance that the primary will achieve ninety percent of its design yield, and ah predict with high certainty the behavior of full weapons systems in complex accident scenarios.‚Äù</a></p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd how are we supposed to assure and predict if we can‚Äôt blow things up?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs our job, Arn. Find a way. What‚Äôs on the table is something called science-based stockpile stewardship.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs opposed to what, theology-based stewardship?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhil, do these morons even know what the fuck they‚Äôre talking about? When Leo was here</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll right, Frank, that‚Äôs really enough, we can do without the, the Leonid meteor shower.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust trying to help us out here, Phil. Somebody should.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe other approach as you all probably know is engineering base. Meaning, turned by a loud squeak from the styrofoam box as Szabo sawed at its contents with a white plastic fork and knife.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLow blood sugar. Go on, listening.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wish you‚Äôd</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you have to file an environmental impact statement to eat lunch?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust do it quietly. Meaning we just remanufacture decaying warheads. So that‚Äôs an option. Dave?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, we already do that. But we can‚Äôt keep doing it indefinitely. Too much of this stuff is only in people‚Äôs heads. What we‚Äôve got now is highly skilled physicists working as librarians, just documenting what they did years ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis wasn‚Äôt documented at the time? Bombs were built without plans? [pg193]</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, of course there are plans, but, but, you never worked directly in weapons, did you, Doctor Quine?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJ Section.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes well, let me ah try to explain. You can dismantle two devices of the exact same mark and rev but with different serial numbers, and the insides differ. I don‚Äôt mean the physics package, although sometimes you have differences there too, but just, you know, the glue, the hardware, there are thousands of parts and when a part becomes unavailable you substitute, so even if we had complete plans, some subcontractors are gone, some parts or processes are unavailable. The only way to do it, really, is to have people around who know how to do it, not just technicians who can follow plans.<a href="#fn104" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> I mean, pardon me Bernd, I have the greatest respect for technicians, but the design and construction of these things is really very intricate indeed. And we do periodically upgrade a design, make a new rev, and that requires a good deal more than, than remanufacturing skills.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd anything, as Dave says, we do that already, remanufacturing gets us nothing new.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes okay so to maintain core competencies‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, we have to keep people interested. Attract new people. In other words, base it in science, not engineering.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHenry?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI agree, but our first priority should be archiving and knowledge capture activities.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean talk to the old guys.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell yes Frank, exactly, our knowledge base is aging, we have to archive and capture before all our designers retire.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTalk about your elder care‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut for the long term, on an ongoing basis, we need to attract a new generation of ah stewards if we‚Äôre to ah maintain core competency.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDave, in your opinion does ‚Äúcore competency‚Äù include the ability to design new weapons?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, of course if you‚Äôve truly got the ability to at steward in the full sense that would include that ability, yes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow does that square with the department‚Äôs public information?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, having the ability doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean using it. I personally [pg194] separate the act of designing a new weapon from physically building it. I advocate maintaining the capability to design by exercising it, not by cutting new metal.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes Frank?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow the hell do we attract good people if all we have is maintenance and cleanup? Wanted, nuclear janitors, I don‚Äôt think so.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, that‚Äôs where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Ignition%20Facility" title="Wikipedia: National Ignition Facility">Avalon</a> comes in, said Ware, spreading his hands.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAvalon will attract new talent?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe most powerful laser in the world? Oh, I think so. That‚Äôs a draw.</p>
<p>Szabo‚Äôs plastic knife squeaked against the styrofoam. Held aloft on his fork was a limp spear of eggplant. ‚ÄìSo this is the deal? We give up testing and we get Avalon?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot in so many words, but that seems to be what‚Äôs on the table, said Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut they‚Äôre committed to Avalon anyway, aren‚Äôt they?I mean key decision zero went through‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Quine looked again for highlighting. ‚Äì‚ÄúApproval of Mission Need‚Äù, yes, but key decision one is the important step. That approves the baseline budget and the site.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know, this thing is going to get built one way or another. Since the SSC was canceled, DOE needs a long term big ticket project to keep their budget up and we deserve to have it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe SS, I‚Äôm sorry, Bill, I‚Äôm not up on</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas%20superconducting%20supercollider" title="Wikipedia: Texas superconducting supercollider">Texas superconducting supercollider</a>? The scientists thought they could find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs%20boson" title="Wikipedia: Higgs boson">Higgs</a>, the managers thought they could write off Texas style parties. They got defunded after digging a two billion dollar ditch outside Austin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine, I agree with Bill. You may not realize it, but we‚Äôve pushed for Avalon for years now. The participating ICF labs signed on last year.</p>
<p>‚ÄìICF, that‚Äôs inertial confinement fusion, Phil.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks very much, Frank, I know what it is.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBill, you laser guys have wanted Avalon for years, but why should I care? What does the weapons side get out of this? [pg185]</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou get to go on living, Frank.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, that‚Äôs cold, Bill.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome on Frank, remember what Leo used to say, always think dual use. You get high energy densities, radiation flow, hydrodynamics, equation of state, opacity, and even something that should interest you Doctor Quine, x-ray las</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen you know, I‚Äôd like to stop using that phrase, dual use. How about benefit? Can we start saying dual benefit?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus, Phil, if it‚Äôs such a problem for you, we can call it dueling banjos.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnyway my point is, Frank, this machine is great for weapons science.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcept that if we sign on, testing‚Äôs gone for good.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, have you been listening? Testing‚Äôs gone anyway.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a huge mistake to accept that. We can outlast this administration. We should hold our ground.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe heard you Frank, said Quine.</p>
<p>Szabo turned his attention to Szechuan eggplant, white plastic knife squeaking.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll right then. The secretary wants a full conceptual design report. If you‚Äôll look at these sheets, as the room‚Äôs stasis was broken by the creak of chairs, rustle of papers being passed, of bodies leaning forward.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll this by May?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the time frame. Let‚Äôs look at, at what else do we need for this program. Marshall?</p>
<p>‚ÄìComputer simulations. A sort of numerical test site.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSimulations never capture all the details you need. This is how we got into so much trouble with Superbright, if you‚Äôll recall.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot the same thing, you were trying to model something that didn‚Äôt exist yet, but we‚Äôve got data from actual shots to test our models against. Over a thousand tests, going back forty years. If we can‚Äôt shoot off new stuff we can look at the old tests again. Archive and reinterpret.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre we calling this science? Sifting through our archives? [pg196]</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAlso faster computers. I mean much faster. I meant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/teraflops" title="Wikipedia: teraflops">teraflops</a>. If not petaflops. The great dome of Marshall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET" title="Wikipedia: MOSFET">Mosfet</a>‚Äôs inclined to a pad. ‚ÄìWe‚Äôre talking at least a three times ten to the seventh problem with some portions running for more than ten to the fifth cycles. Even with optimization, simulations will require say hundred teraflop computing speeds and tens of terabytes of memory. We‚Äôre looking at arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive%20mesh%20refinement" title="Wikipedia: Adaptive mesh refinement">adaptive refinement meshes</a>. We‚Äôre looking at end-to-end first-principles simulation capabilities based on high resolution adaptive numerical methods. We‚Äôre looking at massively parallel architectures. Full-system full-physics 3-D simulations validated using AGEX [above-ground-experimentation] facilities and past underground test data. We‚Äôre talking scalability. Figure we‚Äôll need to increase everything by a factor of ten by the time we‚Äôre done. The bald head came up and the gleam in Mosfet‚Äôs eye seemed to follow teraflops and petaflops up into some cybernetic empyrean. ‚ÄìWe‚Äôve been talking to aXon about prototyping. They already supply workstations to the physics groups.</p>
<p>‚ÄìStill with us, Phil?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure I, just a little jet lagged. So is this all possible.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust give us the funding‚Ä¶ the funding which, as the politician once remarked about a few billion here and a few billion there, started to look, with the addition of each new ballpark figure on the whiteboard, like real money, a reality it generously extended on credit to the still-prospective program names alongside the figures: Avalon Laser Facility $1.1B, DARHT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual%20Axis%20Radiographic%20Hydrodynamic%20Test%20Facility" title="Wikipedia: Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility">Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility</a> $120M, ADAPT Advanced Production and Design Technology Program, ASCI <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced%20Strategic%20Computing%20Initiative" title="Wikipedia: Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative">Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative</a> $122M, APPF <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=602492">Atlas Pulsed Power Facility</a> $43M, AHF <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/bdit/html/projects/AHF.htm">Advanced Hydrotest Facility</a> $422M, MESA Microsystems Engineering and Sciences Application $400M, HEAF <a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/fac/heaf/">High-Explosives Applications Facility</a> $45M, FXR Flash X-Ray linear induction accelerator $85M, <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/str/Baker.html">CFF</a> <a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/fac/site300/cff/index.html">Contained</a> <a href="http://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/defenseprograms/stockpilestewardship/defensescience/dsfacilities/cff">Firing Facility</a> $48M, ARS Advanced Radiation Source $240M, ECF <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/research/facilities/technology_deployment_centers/explosive_component.html">Explosive Components Facility</a> $28M, BEEF <a href="http://www2.nstec.com/Documents/Fact%20Sheets/BEEF.pdf">Big Explosives Experimental Facility</a>, all with ‚Äìgoals and milestones, start drawing them up, stifling a yawn. ‚ÄìOkay? Anything else? Are we done? Yes Arn? [pg197]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre rushing to get the sensors ready for the Persephone shot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShot? There are no tests‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìMoon shot, Phil. A joint NASA-DoD project. We‚Äôre supplying the instrumentation and guidance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, that. I just hadn‚Äôt heard the, the name.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs on the cover of this month‚Äôs Century 21, Phil. Somebody wrote a Director‚Äôs News column about it under your name.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes all right, I know the project, I just don‚Äôt have time to, to keep up with all the cute names.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour ah column has it entering lunar orbit in early February. It‚Äôll actually be March.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFour weeks from launch to lunar orbit? Why so long?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôll be in earth orbit for a while.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoing what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI ah, I don‚Äôt think everyone here needs to know that. Also, there‚Äôs an added leg after the moon, a rendezvous with a near-earth asteroid‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust want you to be clear on the entire mission.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, now are we‚Ä¶? when a sudden dampness on his thigh drew his eyes down to a dark stain spreading from a drip off the edge of the table where black tamari [soy sauce] had pooled under Szabo‚Äôs styrofoam.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Szabo followed Quine‚Äôs gaze, and the practiced annoyance on his features flickered into genuine chagrin for a moment before he pushed the box aside and stabbed at the pool with a napkin. ‚ÄìGod, I‚Äôm sorry Philip. I must have cut through the, I‚Äôm terribly sorry, I‚Äôll pay for the cleaning‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs okay, Frank. Look, why don‚Äôt we call it a, yes Glenn?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe do have one little problem I‚Äôd like to bring up. This ah crackpot group, CANT, they‚Äôre suing us. They claim we didn‚Äôt list new construction on an EIS and that we‚Äôre hiding waste disposal information related to the site.</p>
<p>Quine looked guardedly around the room, where only blank masks looked back.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes Glenn, I think I know what that‚Äôs about. Counsel‚Äôs already on it. Bring what you have to my office. Oh, ah, while I‚Äôve got you all, [pg198] is anyone else having trouble with their phones?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhone fax ethernet you name it, they‚Äôre pulling new cable, supposed to give us T3 lines in every office but meanwhile it‚Äôs a mess, I‚Äôm getting other people‚Äôs voicemail and I don‚Äôt know what.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank?</p>
<p>Szabo looked up from folding the soiled napkin to say, ‚ÄìAfraid there‚Äôs no helping it, we‚Äôre upgrading all the lines because of the network integration, secure wide bandwidth fiber optics, bound to be some growing pains.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, are we, are we done? See you all la‚Ä¶ while at the back of the room behind the rising figures a door opened as Quine glanced up to see ‚ÄìDennis, is that you? I thought you were on leave.</p>
<p>‚ÄìEntrepreneurial leave of absence, yes, but see I‚Äôm working on something, and I wanted to show y</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis, this meeting is for section heads onl</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know, that‚Äôs why I thought you should all have a look at this, see I was visiting CERN in Geneva where this guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim%20Berners-Lee" title="Wikipedia: Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> came up with some really neat stu</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook Dennis, we‚Äôre fin</p>

<p>‚ÄìAren‚Äôt they doing this at SLAC? Converting their high-energy physics database. Weenies.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell see I thought we might want to get involved at some level, I brought my laptop so I could show anyone who</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll have a look, Dennis, said Szabo. ‚ÄìLet these other <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/macher" title="(Yiddish) an important person, often in the negative sense of self-important; a bigwig">machers</a> get on with their day, as some drifted out into the hall, muttering, ‚Äìgoing to get criticism that Avalon has weapons applications, ‚Äìwell of course it has weapons applications, who are we, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General%20Foods" title="Wikipedia: General Foods">General Foods</a>? ‚Äìgood thing it‚Äôs a construction project, always good for the local economy, probably get the support of the Herald, ‚Äìgeez, we always get the Herald, editor‚Äôs son works here for Chr, ‚Äìexcept when he‚Äôs been talking to that CANT group and he forgets which side his</p>

<p>‚ÄìOkay you all, I‚Äôm</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust so we don‚Äôt waste a lot of time here, Dennis, believe it or not we‚Äôve heard of the World Wide Web. [pg199]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, good, so you see the commercial potential.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCommercial‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is called a brows</p>

<p>Kihara‚Äôs face flushed as he stabbed at ESC, ‚ÄìUm, let me just, system‚Äôs a little slow responding, let‚Äôs go to another</p>
<p>‚Äìthought we purged those files months ago</p>

<p>‚Äìeveryone, I‚Äôm going. See you‚Ä¶ as no head turned to follow Quine out the door and into the hallway where the machers had dispersed leaving the way to his office clear except for ‚ÄìBran! Have you got a minute? Walk with me, and Nolan, haggard, fell in step. Past the open doorways where countless managers sat bemused by their computers<a href="#fn107" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> and past a conference room where a point made too emphatically sent a dry marker skating out across the hallway.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip. Check your e-mail today? Our sister lab in New Mexico [Los Alamos National Lab (LANL)] is offering five hundred dollars each for the internal organs of workers like ourselves. After one‚Äôs demise, of course. The tissue analysis group studies them for radiation effects. They have quite a collection. Some of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen%20Silkwood" title="Wikipedia: Karen Silkwood">Karen Silkwood</a>‚Äôs bones, relics worthy of pilgrimage. No premium for management organs, I‚Äôm afraid. Have you heard the one about the dean‚Äôs brain?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBran, is it common knowledge that you‚Äôre ghosting the Director‚Äôs News column for me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf anyone thinks about it at all I think it‚Äôs naturally assumed that you have more important things to do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSzabo needled me about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSzabo needles everyone. How was the meeting?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, apart from Szabo interrup</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I mean Washington. [pg201]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWashington? Oh. We met in the SCIF, you know what that is?</p>
<p>‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive%20Compartmented%20Information%20Facility" title="Wikipedia: Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility">Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility</a>, we‚Äôve got one.

<p>‚ÄìDifficile est non satirum scribere.<a href="#fn108" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho came up with that lovely word stewardship?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe secretary. I think she got it from some management consultant.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat happened to your pants leg?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? Oh, it‚Äôs just a, a spill, I should‚Ä¶ but his intent went unstated as they came into range of an orotund voice raised in rapturous self-appraisals, ‚ÄìPresident Eubanks, it just has a nice alliteration to it doesn‚Äôt it? and ‚ÄìDolores? Please‚Ä¶ as the voice faded completely behind the closing door.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGuy‚Äôs running for Congress, did you know that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat guy?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOn the radio.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine came out of the bathroom dabbing at his pants with a hand towel discolored by tamari. ‚ÄìGlenn Boniface brought up something we need to look at, lawsuit from CANT, something about an EIS?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow much do you know about that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNothing, really. We should go over it but I don‚Äôt have time now. Tomorrow?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll check with Dolores.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks Bran, as the phone rang, ‚ÄìYes? Already? Okay, just a min, covering the mouthpiece, ‚ÄìSee you tomorrow, to Nolan‚Äôs nod and exit, passed on his way out by a cleancut younger man on his way in, suit coiffed and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dentifriced" title="Wikipedia: dentifriced">dentifriced</a> to a standard somewhat higher than the lab mean as Quine came around the desk towel still in his hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOrrin Gate.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRight, pleased to, excuse me, my hand‚Äôs wet, let me</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm very glad to meet you, Doctor Quine.</p>
<p>‚Äìjust get some things together, opening then shutting his case, opening then shutting one drawer and another, ‚Äìhere, sorry about [pg202] this, just back from Washington, a little disorganized‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake your time. Did you get the phone I sent? The account is activated, just go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes well, it‚Äôs not something I really need.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôll come to rely on it. I promise you, five years from now everyone will have one. Moms, dads, kids, one in every car.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre interested in our orbiters, said Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOur satellites need a low earth orbit for minimum latency time. We‚Äôre thinking of a constellation of a few hundred, though that may change.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe problem here is that this CRADA basically asks for access to subsystems of our Slingshot antimissile interceptors, which is a classified project.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet assured me that it fell under dual use. You can put in place any firewalls you need to.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre calling it dual benefit now. The Slingshot thrusters, why are those of interest?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLow earth orbits tend to decay quickly. My understanding is that these thrusters permit stable orbits for a longer time frame.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I ask what this means, in ah Appendix A, the Statement of Work, ‚Äúto establish the optimal topologies of a reconfigurable constellation of low earth orbit satellites under a variety of conditions‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause of latency and bandwidth issues we may need to fine tune the constellation once it‚Äôs in place. You see</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou want to put satellites in orbit and then move them around? I‚Äôve never heard of that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt gives us flexibility our competitors lack.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd these are civilian comm sats.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCivilian, military, possibly both.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt know?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAt this point in time, we‚Äôre not sure what our content will look like. A constellation of satellites might have to be reconfigured quickly to take advantage of rapidly changing markets. We need to maintain fluence and modularity. We need to handle multiple channel rates, protocols, and service priorities and to support a wide range of applications including the Internet, intranets, multimedia communication, [pg203] LAN interconnect, colocation, wireless backhaul, et cetera. Many of the applications and protocols we‚Äôll serve in the future haven‚Äôt been conceived yet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell in that case how can you, I mean, that‚Äôs not the business plan I read.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, no, what you have must be half a year old. And I must say, this slowness is discouraging and costly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes well, I have to run this by the book.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAt other labs, I understand, NASA labs for instance, directors can approve CRADAs directly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs true of the GOGO<a href="#fn109" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> labs but we‚Äôre a GOCO<a href="#fn110" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìContractor operated, yes, but NASA labs are GOGO. Now this Slingshot technology is being used on an upcoming joint NASA-DoD mission, lunar mapping, is that right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere did you get that information?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAviation Week. I was hoping to gain access to the thruster performance data from that mission. And the sensor performance data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe sensors? Why?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs I say, our content is still fluent. Weather, environmental tracking, surveillance, all are possible missions for these platforms.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, this is extremely broad. We can‚Äôt share classified DoD data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPartners. What partners.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf the CRADA were in effect and you were properly nondisclosed I‚Äôd be more willing to share that information.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre your partners defense contractors?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, at least not for the US.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot for the US? They‚Äôre foreign partners?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOne is.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen we can‚Äôt possibly share this data. It raises all sorts of, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms%20Export%20Control%20Act" title="Wikipedia: Arms Export Control Act">export control</a> issues. Anyway, you see here, where is it, here, Article 22, ‚ÄúUS Competitiveness, products embodying intellectual property developed under this CRADA shall be substantially manufactured in the United States.‚Äù<a href="#fn111" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìI think I see the problem. This is about Mister Kim, isn‚Äôt it? Doctor [pg204] Highet was suspicious of him. Mister Kim is head of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea%20Aerospace%20Industries" title="Wikipedia: Korea Aerospace Industries">aerospace division</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai" title="Wikipedia: Hyundai">Hyundai</a><a href="#fn112" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a>. If all goes well they‚Äôll be assembling the sats for us. I tell you this in strict confidence.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese platforms were designed to be kinetic kill vehicles. You‚Äôre not interested in that part of their mission?</p>
<p>Gate stared at him for a moment, then laughed. ‚ÄìWell that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Was that Doctor Highet‚Äôs idea? But then, he‚Äôs known for his flamboyant imagination. No, we just want maneuverable, low orbit platforms.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat you want them for seems ah fluent.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine, I‚Äôm a visionary. In my industry you have to be. That doesn‚Äôt mean I have a single vision, I have many visions, constantly adjusting to the market. I thrive on chaos, When other people run in fear, I see an opportunity.</p>
<p>Quine touched a throb in his temple and shut his eyes while outside some engine unseen went on with its building, then he refocused on the pages before him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow do you plan to launch these?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre inviting bids from international <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch%20service%20provider" title="Wikipedia: Launch service provider">launch providers</a> including the US, Russia, China, and Korea. Candidate rockets include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas%20%28rocket%20family%29" title="Wikipedia: Atlas (rocket family)">Atlas</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%20%28rocket%20family%29" title="Wikipedia: Proton (rocket family)">Proton</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long%20March%20%28rocket%20family%29" title="Wikipedia: Long March (rocket family)">Long March</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taepodong-2" title="Wikipedia: Taepodong-2">No Dong</a>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo Dong? Isn‚Äôt that a North Korean missile?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve talked to Senator Chase about this, and he‚Äôs eager to move things along. I really need to expedite this before the Persephone launch.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs in two weeks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Can we go forward?</p>
<p>Quine stood and extended his hand. ‚ÄìI‚Äôll be in touch.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSeriously, Doctor Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll review this material with the Slingshot team and let you know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet me know when?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen we‚Äôre done.</p>
<p>Gate leaned slightly forward and clasped Quine‚Äôs hand briefly. ‚ÄìThanks for your time.</p>
<p>In the vacant office Quine glanced at his watch, then the wall clock, then lifted the phone to hear a waspish voice, ‚Äìterrible administrator, lost control of the meeting, and replaced the handset, face burning, the heat diffusing into a kind of despair as he stuffed papers into his case [pg205] and snapped it shut.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDolores? He stepped into the outer office where, ‚Äìno no no, heh heh heh, a bully pulpit is not a pulpit used by a, as Dolores stilled the radio and looked up. ‚ÄìIs this, is this guy ever off the air?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSacramento reruns the show three hours later.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay look, I‚Äôm leaving early. I had almost no sleep and, and, what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour appointment with Jeremy Rector?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh Jesus. Can you, oh never mind, let‚Äôs get it over with, and he retreated to the inner office, where the noise of jackhammers rode over the din of some compressor as he went into the bathroom for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Wikipedia: Naproxen">Naproxen</a> 220 mg and saw as he turned the tap an inch of water still standing in the sink. He swallowed the tablets, then jiggled the drain lever repeatedly until a few small bubbles emerged and the water slurped away. He sat at the desk and opened a folder Jeremy Rector Principal Management Analyst, and frowned at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum%20vitae" title="Wikipedia: Curriculum vitae">vitae</a> inside for a minute before slapping it shut. The jackhammers fell silent.</p>
<p>Rector entered, clothed in a brown wool suit, swinging a calfskin case.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJeremy, sit down.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThank you Doctor Quine, as the calfskin case clicked open with a snap and a stack of folders came out onto the desk.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan we, before we start, I‚Äôve been looking at your vitae‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, is there a problem?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo but, I mean, you came here straight from the General Accounting Office, is that right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I was looking for a change.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet hired you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it was after he left.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you talked to him at some point?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe, ah, had a discussion, yes, brief, informal. Why?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause it seems, I mean, Highet is implicated in some of these investigations, it could appear improper that you were hired at a time when‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI went over this with Lab counsel. You know, IRS agents sometimes go into private practice, you can hire them to represent you if [pg206] you‚Äôre audited. To me this is similar, an audit just goes easier if you have someone who knows the ropes, who can clarify issues for the auditors. I think Doctor Highet understood that, he certainly never said I was supposed to, well, cover anything up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no I‚Äôm not suggesting, just want to, to clarify‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, my position. That I‚Äôm not condoning anything but full cooperation in any ongoing investigations.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen if we can, I want to look at this buffer zone business.</p>
<p>Rector opened a folder. ‚ÄìRight. Well, it seems that the toxics mitigation pilot program, Site Alpha, you know, the vineyard over the toxic plume, needs to be expanded.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExpanded? Why?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, the plume is spreading offsite. The expansion brings it onsite again. Anyway, some people in E Section got wind of this, recommended it actually, and they bought land in the expansion zone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey thought they could make a profit selling the land back to the Lab? But that‚Äôs, what‚Äôs wrong with these people, don‚Äôt we pay them enough, that they have to pull this crap?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI think we can convince GAO to drop the investigation if the people involved make restitution.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that enough?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf you want to reprimand them in some way, that‚Äôs your choice. But in the interests of the Lab‚Äôs ongoing situation, I‚Äôd say settle it and move on. Now we have the missing property and the unassigned overhead costs‚Ä¶ as Rector shifted the first folder to the bottom of his stack revealing the next, one inch thick.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, Jeremy, I‚Äôm sorry, but is this urgent? I meant twenty-four hour urgent?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, no, I mean we have months to respond, but there‚Äôs a lot to get through and I thought</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know, I just, I‚Äôm just kind of jet lagged and I can‚Äôt really concentrate, so if you don‚Äôt mind‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, and the calfskin case clicked together with the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chirm" title="(v.) To chirp or to make a mournful cry, as a bird does.">chirm</a> of the phone. [pg207]</p>
<p>‚ÄìHello?</p>
<p>‚ÄìEnjoy your weekend, Doctor Quine.</p>
<p>‚Äìjefe?</p>
<p>‚ÄìConor? Is that you?</p>
<p>‚Äìold me to cal</p>
<p>‚ÄìConor, I can‚Äôt, the phones are still. can you hear me?</p>
<p>‚Äìay?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook I, if you can hear me, I, I, let‚Äôs not meet today, I‚Äôm going to leave early. Okay? Okay?</p>
<p>‚Äìk</p>
<p>He dropped the handset on the cradle, muttered and swept papers into his case, latched it, and strode into the outer office where ‚Äìa grass roots bottoms up effort, was suppressed as he entered.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay Dolores, I‚Äôm</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor R√©ti is on his way up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChrist! Didn‚Äôt I tell you, as a knock sounded. His eyes darted around the room for an escape he knew wasn‚Äôt there from the inevitable he‚Äôd been putting off for months by cautious scheduling.</p>
<p>Morose, limping, R√©ti entered. He bore a gnarled staff taller than himself, and the expression of a man who‚Äôd spent too much time with fools.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor R√©ti, it‚Äôs good to see you. Come, come in‚Ä¶ and Quine let the way into the inner office as R√©ti glanced dispassionately around the room.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo. How is our young director getting on?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot so young. Forty.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBefore I was forty, we had dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Just a few years later, I argued to build a laboratory, this one, to learn everything we could learn about nuclear weapons. So you are right. Forty is not so young. And now, almost half a century after the first bombs, we go on learning.</p>
<p>Quine said nothing. R√©ti stared past him at the drawn blinds, beyond which a jackhammer opened fire.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMay I sit? R√©ti gestured at a chair.</p>
<p>‚ÄìForgive me, of course, please.</p>
<p>R√©ti limped slowly to the chair and lowered himself into it. The [pg208] staff leaned against it like a limb of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil" title="Wikipedia: Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil</a>. ‚ÄìBut that history is not important now. What is important now is to keep the Radiance program alive.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor R√©ti, the administration and the Department of Energy have decided that our work on Radiance is over.</p>
<p>R√©ti pointed at him. ‚ÄìThis important knowledge, for which you and so many others fought so hard, must not be lost.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe knowledge gained was not, in my view, primarily scientific.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou do not yet understand, there are ways to keep programs alive, to reorganize their component parts. I will tell you how.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, but</p>
<p>The pointing finger raised. ‚ÄìOne moment. Many years ago, when I was for one semester a visiting professor at your university, and on your doctoral committee, I read your dissertation and I thought, here is a young man who understands physics. And when your paper on quanta was published with Sorokin, I knew that it was so. I lobbied strongly that you should have a Heinrich Hertz fellowship to come here. And you did excellent work. Now you are director, a rise of meteoric speed, and I wish to put at your disposal some of my experience.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou flatter me. My understanding of physics is not that deep. And the work I did on Radiance was deeply flawed. It led to a scandal.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe work is not flawed. The scandal is in the political necessities.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor R√©ti, perhaps you forget. I worked on the Superbright x-ray laser for years. It didn‚Äôt work and we pretended it did. And we suffered the consequences.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMay I remind you that despite your own highly critical, one might almost say self-lacerating report, our entire team was exonerated by the General Accounting Office. The idea is still a good one. And that is why we must proceed with it on different terms. Now listen to me. I will tell you what we must do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSir, with all due respect. I am director, and I am responsible to the Department of Energy. It is my decision.</p>
<p>R√©ti‚Äôs brows came together. He breathed heavily. ‚ÄìYou are not like Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, sir, I am not. I believe that‚Äôs why I was appointed.</p>
<p>R√©ti sat forward in his chair. His hands met between his knees. [pg209]</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook. My friend Leo Highet is an enthusiast for new ideas. Like me, he is an optimist. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn this case optimism became fraud.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI spoke well of you to the regents. I supported your candidacy. Despite that Leo Highet was my friend, and in my opinion ousted unfairly, I did so for the good of the Lab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI appreciate that, sir.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI remember too that you visited me in the hospital. I should like to think of you as a friend.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou do me too much honor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy friend Leo Highet has his weaknesses, I do not deny it. But whatever else, he has passion. And he understand the political necessity of funding.</p>
<p>Leaning forward, R√©ti grasped the staff and stamped it upon the floor. ‚ÄìFunding comes from the threat. Now, this administration does not think that Russia is a threat. I say they are wrong. But even so, there is no shortage of threats. There is another great threat, and I do not mean the threat from north Africa to southern Europe. There is a threat of being hit by a comet, or asteroid. The last time it happened was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska%20event" title="Wikipedia: Tunguska event">Tunguska, Siberia</a>.<a href="#fn113" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìIn nineteen hundred and eight, said Quine. He had heard this before. It was part of R√©ti‚Äôs road show. Following Tunguska he brought up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub%20crater" title="Wikipedia: Chicxulub crater">Chixculub</a> (Mayan, some said, for devil‚Äôs asshole) where during the Cretaceous Period, a meteor had hurled enough debris aloft to darken the earth, change its climate, and cause planetwide extinctions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, in nineteen hundred and eight. I was then five months old. It was an aboveground explosion of ten million tons equivalent. Had it happened near a populated region, it would have been the biggest disaster, and we have excellent reason to believe that this disaster with appropriate notification can be averted. Here is a threat that is less probable than most other threats, but when it happens, it can become so big that, you know, it wiped out sixty-five million years ago the dinosaurs. That I think is a very interesting threat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAccording to the secretary of energy, said Quine, ‚Äìthe Lab‚Äôs mission is now stockpile stewardship and management.</p>
<p>R√©ti fixed his eyes on Quine. ‚ÄìI understand you held a meeting. I [pg210] would have liked to attend.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry, I thought you were out of town. It was urgent that we move forward.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have no official duties. It is your prerogative to include me or not. But I will say that other directors have profited from my experience. I will say that I have always been notified of meetings.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll see that you get complete minutes. It was a discussion of the stewardship program. We</p>
<p>Again the staff struck the floor. ‚ÄìStewardship. Do you know what <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/steward#Etymology">that word means</a>? It means you are warder of the sty. A keeper of pigs. Is that what you wish?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe stewardship program has interesting elements. For example, the Avalon laser.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, Avalon, do you think I don‚Äôt know? Avalon is ours by right. We have planned it for years. Since the very beginning of this Lab we have pursued inertial confinement fusion. I wrote the first papers on it. Now, this new administration wants a test ban treaty, which is impossible because Russia will cheat<a href="#fn114" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a>. And they think to buy our compliance with Avalon. I say we should have Avalon plus Radiance!</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs impossible. All missile defense work is now run by the Pentagon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe Pentagon will not continue the x-ray laser.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPerhaps not.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOn which you worked so hard, gave so much.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou could look on Avalon as a way of continuing and vindicating Radiance‚Äôs x-ray laser work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat will happen to J Section?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt say at this time. There will be cuts.</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen to me. You must make a project to investigate the possible results of an asteroid impact. And the possibilities of protecting us from such an impact. And then you will find that much of Radiance, including Superbright and Slingshot, is also good for asteroid defense. Lasers, orbiting interceptors, nuclear weapons, all this can be repurchased. There is time to get all this into the budget request. There is support in Congress. We must have this!</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrankly, sir, I‚Äôm not sorry to see this missile defense work gone. [pg211] Many feel it‚Äôs a violation of the antiballistic missile treaty.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat treaty is no longer valid because the Soviet Union no longer exists. In any case, this work will never stop, because it has many powerful allies.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou will see what I mean. And you will be sorry you let it slip away from you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor R√©ti, our budget may be down this year but</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt is not just the money! They cannot be allowed to tell us what to do. And in our work there must always be a nuclear component. Do you know why? Because they fear the nucleus. They respect it. And we are its masters. But now they would reduce us to simulations. This must not be. This would be our end.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have no choice.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you understand something, when Radiance started, I could go directly to the president and ask for funds. On one occasion I secured a hundred million dollars, just by asking. On another, sixty million. Just like that, and gnarled fingers rose and met but did not snap, ‚ÄìFrom black budgets. Now we have a new president. I cannot do that with this new president. So you must.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou must! Why do you resist this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSir. Radiance cost us credibility, we lost good people over it, we lost the trust of our owners. We‚Äôll have nothing further to do with it, in name or in fact. That‚Äôs final.</p>
<p>R√©ti looked up sharply. Pale piercing eyes sunk in sagging flesh. He thrust himself forward, trying to stand. The head of his staff swipe the air. ‚ÄìYou must not! Must not! Permit such an end to our experiment. We must find the next enemy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease! Quine stood at the moment R√©ti sank back into his chair, eyes cast to the floor, mouth open, lower lip pendulous. ‚ÄìDon‚Äôt excite yourself.</p>
<p>At last R√©ti looked up at Quine, eyelids trembling. ‚ÄìI am stupid, I am emotional, I am old. I had such hopes for you. Why do you not ask me? Months you have been here. You do not come to me, you do not ask me for advice, for counsel, for anything. This is not right. [pg212]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI apologize. I, I‚Äôve been busy, and you‚Äôre often not here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOr perhaps you believe, as outsiders do, that I am some kind of monster? But you know better. In the old man‚Äôs eyes was an entreaty, in his voice a belligerence. ‚ÄìDo you know that I argued for a demonstration? To drop one atomic bomb over Tokyo Bay, or on an uninhabited island<a href="#fn115" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a>. There was not time enough, they said. It would be too difficult and expensive, they said, to build another bomb. That was the last time I attempted to influence policy. It is not a scientist‚Äôs place. But! I am not afraid to express my opinion as a private citizen! And for a moment R√©ti was silent, reflecting no doubt on the many times he had expressed, sometimes on Lab letterhead, his opinion as a private citizen, but the memories were perhaps not uniformly happy, for his eyes narrowed and when he went on his tone was confidential, as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow I will tell you something. During the War, we all worked together, we all knew that the Bomb was important science and it was important to the world. We all felt that. When the War was over it changed. We were no longer together. There were two camps: make more, better bombs, or stop there. You would think that men so smart, so excellent in their field, could agree. It was obvious the Russians would build one. But no. And the strange thing was this. We were all excellent, all first rate, but even so, some were a bit above the rest, yes? And the very best, these were the men who did not want to go on making bombs. So when this Lab started, I became director, because I had no competition. I was the best of those who remained. The best of not the very best, do you see? I had won by a forfeit. My friends were no longer my friends. Now I talked with generals and senators, to whom physics was a magic trick. To whom I was a magus. That was my compensation. Nobel prizes for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels%20Bohr" title="Wikipedia: Niels Bohr">Bohr</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene%20Wigner" title="Wikipedia: Eugene Wigner">Wigner</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert%20Einstein" title="Wikipedia: Albert Einstein">Einstein</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest%20Lawrence" title="Wikipedia: Ernest Lawrence">Lawrence</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico%20Fermi" title="Wikipedia: Enrico Fermi">Fermi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold%20Urey" title="Wikipedia: Harold Urey">Urey</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidor%20Isaac%20Rabi" title="Wikipedia: Isidor Isaac Rabi">Rabi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans%20Bethe" title="Wikipedia: Hans Bethe">Bethe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix%20Bloch" title="Wikipedia: Felix Bloch">Bloch</a>. For me, the ear of generals and Presidents. Now you know something I never told even my good friend Leo Highet. Something I am maybe a little ashamed of. So that you will understand what this place is to me.</p>
<p>He extended the staff. ‚ÄìBut I will tell you further. I am right and they are wrong. The age of the heroic individual scientist is over. The bomb changed everything forever. From then on we work always in [pg213] teams, always funded by government. And government is not interested in <em>physis</em>, in <em>scientia</em>, they want <em>techne</em>. I saw this sooner and more clearly than any. So we give them what they want! And in return they permit us to go on with our work. And we are <em>not</em>, and Quine shrank from the fury and loathing he saw in R√©ti‚Äôs eyes, we are not <em>owned</em>.</p>
<p>Leaning on his staff, R√©ti got to his feet, shaking off Quine‚Äôs hand. When he had left, Quine sat trembling. He cleared his throat as if he would speak but said nothing. He rose and went to the bathroom where he ran water into a glass and reached for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerian%20%28herb%29%23Medicinal%20use" title="Wikipedia: Valerian (herb)#Medicinal use">Valerian</a> 500 mg when the shrill of the phone turned him. He glanced at the mirror to find something vicious in the face there, something that hid itself as quickly as it had appeared.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes Dolores? All right, tell Conor I can‚Äôt see him this evening. I‚Äôm leaving now.</p>
<p>By the time he reached the road an anticipation of night stood in the east where the sun‚Äôs last rays raked tender green hills, an island of serenity beneath the ridge‚Äôs stubble of windmills, relics of a time before his time at the Lab when, however briefly, its mission has encompassed the passive generation of energy as well as its explosive deployment. The enemy? Where now is the enemy? His distracted gaze moved over the stopped traffic and the unfinished pylons of a freeway overpass separating on the one side a lighted plinth of signs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit%20City" title="Wikipedia: Circuit City">Circuit City</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_%22R%22_Us">Toys ‚Äú–Ø‚Äù Us</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%20%26%20Noble" title="Wikipedia: Barnes &amp; Noble">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office%20Depot" title="Wikipedia: Office Depot">Office Depot</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed%20Bath%20%26%20Beyond" title="Wikipedia: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</a>, from its counterpart on the other side proclaiming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompUSA" title="Wikipedia: CompUSA">CompUSA</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zany%20Brainy" title="Wikipedia: Zany Brainy">Zany Brainy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders%20Group" title="Wikipedia: Borders Group">Borders</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staples%20Inc." title="Wikipedia: Staples Inc.">Staples</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linens_%27n_Things">Linen ‚ÄôN Things</a>, and past those to the redtiled roofs of Estancia Estates which recalled an era so bygone it had never existed, a dream of California begun when Cortez‚Äôs men landed on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja%20peninsula" title="Wikipedia: Baja peninsula">Baja peninsula</a> which they mistook for the setting of the romance <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las%20Sergas%20de%20Esplanadian" title="Wikipedia: Las Sergas de Esplanadian">Las Sergas de Esplanadian</a></em>, whose author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garcia%20Ordonez%20de%20Montalvo" title="Wikipedia: Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo">Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo</a> averred that somewhere hereabouts was an enchanted isle of gold and pearls and griffins where Queen Califia‚Äôs black amazons dwelled and welcomed men once a year for purposes of procreation, and Cortez‚Äôs men in their hope (two girls for every boy!) or disappointment, or irony, gave the peninsula that empire‚Äôs name, whence the name traveled north to the Alta mainland and into a further dream [pg214] of gracious caballeros and se√±oritas kept ever fresh to ameliorate the zeal of the friars <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspar%20de%20Portola" title="Wikipedia: Gaspar de Portola">Gaspar de Portola</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junipero%20Serra" title="Wikipedia: Junipero Serra">Junipero Serra</a>, who in their exigent grace converted nearly as many natives as they enslaved, leaving the land vacant for the newest dream of Gracious Living in The Valley Starting in the $150,000 The Vineyard Starting in the $250,000 and The Glen Starting in the $350,000, where the only visible gold and pearl were the headlights and taillights of innumerable cars crawling past that green island of serenity dotted with the frames of new homes rising in the sun‚Äôs last rays like a tide of wrack up the hillsides. His eyes darted like animals in the cage of his anxious face, leapt from the darkening ground of nature to the lighted figures of man‚Äôs improvements upon it and back as if somewhere in this vast scribble and sprawl were signs to unlock the meaning of his slow unsteady progress, but the sign before him said EXIT NLY, and led only to more of the same.</p>
<p>As he entered the house he called out, ‚ÄìLynn? coming into the kitchen and glancing to the refrigerator where the calendar JANUARY was marked 6 PHILIP BACK and a red line crossed 24 through 31 LYNN IN GENEVA CTBT CONF and under 25 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base" title="Wikipedia: Vandenberg Air Force Base">VANDENBURG</a> LAUNCH, and then to the sink, where apron strings were drawn tight across the trim back and flat shoulder blades up to closecropped black hair touched with russet. His shoes squeaked crossing the blue and white vinyl. She turned to him shaking water from her hands, smiling, wiping them on the apron. ‚ÄìWelcome home.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm glad to see you. God I‚Äôm tired. What a day.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI knew you wouldn‚Äôt call me back. So I just showed up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI did call, I called you at home and at work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut no message.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt like talking to machines.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you don‚Äôt want to be overheard talking to me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, come on, I</p>
<p>‚ÄìEveryone knows about us anyway.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you think so?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt sound very happy about it. She put her wiry arms around his neck.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm very happy. [pg215]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThank you, so am I.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not a problem at work? Nobody‚Äôs mad?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, they think I‚Äôm going to convert you. And I will, too. Except Tony Luz is mad at me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe wants you for himself.</p>
<p>‚ÄìToo bad for him.</p>
<p>As he leaned in to kiss her a weight in him shifted but didn‚Äôt settle. Her lips smiled under his.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow let me cook. Here. She handed him a glass of wine, golden and heavy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks. What‚Äôs this about a lawsuit? I hear you‚Äôre suing us?</p>
<p>She bent to the oven, its door protesting as it opened. ‚ÄìWho, me? You must mean that peacenik outfit I work for.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre the ones.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt seems you‚Äôve been careless with your EISes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt mean that oversight in the building plans, do you? We issued an errata.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNeed to know? She looked up, black eyes glinting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, sorry. I won‚Äôt ask. What are we having?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGrilled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portobello%20mushrooms" title="Wikipedia: portobello mushrooms">portobello mushrooms</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/risotto" title="Wikipedia: risotto">risotto</a> alla milanese, salad. Into the oven she slid a baking sheet bearing two mushroom caps big as hamburgers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou spoil me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI do indeed. Will you set the table?</p>
<p>On its surface was a vase of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alstroemeria" title="Wikipedia: alstroemeria">alstroemeria</a> shedding striped petals into a bowl holding two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosc%20pears" title="Wikipedia: Bosc pears">Bosc pears</a> and two green apples, and onto a strew of newspaper clippings, <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-869220.html">US Forms Radiation Task Force</a>, Inexcusable Experiments, 33 Hospitals Were Involved In Cold War Radiation Experiments, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%20radiation%20experiments%23Experiments%20performed%20in%20the%20United%20States" title="Wikipedia: Human radiation experiments#Experiments performed in the United States">Human Radiation Tests</a> Were Widespread, <a href="http://articles.mcall.com/1994-01-04/news/2969176_1_radiation-experiments-energy-department-white-house" title="White House Task Force To Probe Radiation Exposure">Prisoner Irradiation Probed</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs all this?</p>
<p>She turned to him, a shallot in one hand, a paring knife in the other. ‚ÄìYou haven‚Äôt seen?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve been busy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, this is a huge story. Doctors injected cancer patients with plutonium, they irradiated prisoners‚Äô testicles, they fed pregnant [pg216] women radioactive iron, all without their knowledge or consent. It really has the Auschwitz touch. And it‚Äôs not just them. It‚Äôs the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/downwinders" title="Wikipedia: downwinders">downwinders</a>, the</p>
<p>‚ÄìDown what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe people who live downwind from the test site. All through the fifties when the bombs were going off, and they had no warning, no precautions, no compensation, the cancer rates are unbelievable, if you could hear these people talk, Philip. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. Can you hand me the salad bowl?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, but, with testing stopped‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs not the point. This is the department‚Äôs history. You can‚Äôt bury history.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought you were preparing for the treaty talks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI am. I‚Äôm following this because Janine, the reporter, has worked with us. You couldn‚Äôt have a better example of why people don‚Äôt trust DOE. They stonewalled Janine at every turn. Some of the documents were almost fifty years old and they still won‚Äôt come clean.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe new secretary wants to change things.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShe did the stonewalling.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, she extended the ban on testing, she‚Äôs declassifying, and she did admit to these experiments, you saw her openness press conf</p>
<p>‚ÄìShe had no choice after the articles appeared. Anyway, she‚Äôs only admitted to eighteen victims, there are probably thousands. Now they‚Äôll form a task force and in a year or two they‚Äôll still be arguing over compensation.</p>
<p>Outside, beyond the black glass of the kitchen window, the yard went suddenly bright in the wind bending a tree tripping a motion sensor. He looked out at the tossing of the hedge some ten feet away, a wild motion constrained, chaos on the edge of complexity, until the floodlight snapped off. Then he returned to the clippings, Aguas Secas Desert Witness No More Bombs No More Tests.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you go to this? Were you at the test site?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, that. No, I stayed home this year. You show up, you listen to the usual homilies about peace, you get arrested and released. You spend three days validating each others‚Äô righteousness and at the end of it all nothing has changed. I always come home tired and grouchy. [pg217] Anyway I had too much to do getting ready for the CTBT. Are you changing the subject?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I just‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip? Our agreement?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt need to know anything about it. Really.</p>
<p>She scrutinized him. ‚ÄìAll right. I trust you. Sit. Eat. You look exhausted. Holding a baking sheet in an oven mitt she raised a mushroom on a spatula and placed it before him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat a day. First the flight. Then a terrible, long meeting. Then R√©ti came to see me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìR√©ti?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd been dreading it. He went on and on about this asteroid defense stuff, still trying to keep Radiance alive through it. He won‚Äôt give it up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut surely after all the scandals‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe thinks we‚Äôve been exonerated. He thinks it‚Äôs a great success that we spent the Soviets into oblivion. Maybe he thinks we can outspend the asteroid belt too.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe can‚Äôt keep that program alive, can he?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know. Not as it was anyway.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre under a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou won‚Äôt believe what Highet did. Our new principal management analyst is one of the guys who wrote the GAO report on Radiance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you really telling me this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you mean? Of course. It‚Äôs so Highet, I thought you‚Äôd appreciate it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo are you going to fire this guy?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy? He‚Äôs been vetted, and anyway he may be able to tell me something about Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve really got it in for Highet, don‚Äôt you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt?</p>
<p>‚ÄìCould we, I just want to not talk about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI always wondered where you got that report on Superbright. You had a copy even before I turned it in.<a href="#fn116" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, you know I can‚Äôt tell you that. [pg218]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWas it Bran? Bran Nolan?<a href="#fn117" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease, I can‚Äôt tell you. Have some salad‚Ä¶ Arugula, watercress, sliced pears, hazelnuts, walnut oil, raspberry vinegar, rinsing it with the last of the Chardonnay, and then, ‚ÄìI have to look at some papers, here let me‚Ä¶ He rose to clear the table as, across the last of her wine, turning the glass by the stem, she watched him cross to the sink with dishes and return to the clippings bunched under the alstroemeria, pausing at Aguas Secas Desert Witness finally to say, ‚ÄìIs it necessary to call us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor%20Strangelove" title="Wikipedia: Doctor Strangelove">Doctor Strangelove</a>s in your literature?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs not ours, Philip. That‚Äôs another group.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt is strange that I love you, don‚Äôt you think? In her eyes something worried, then fled. She stood up and pressed her mouth to his. Her breath to his. After a moment she broke it off. ‚ÄìBut I do love you, Philip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I‚Ä¶ I know. But‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you remember the first time we made love? I came over and told you to take my clothes off.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI remember.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt want to be carried away by the moment, I wanted to decide it. For so long I thought that getting involved with you was a terrible idea.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you kept calling. I wondered if you wanted to use me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere was a little of that. But you, you wanted to be used.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I did. By you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou look, sometimes, you look so frustrated and disappointed, but under it there‚Äôs something else. Like you‚Äôre still looking for something. You haven‚Äôt given up. You didn‚Äôt just walk away from it all.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you sorry now that you have me?</p>
<p>She looked almost smiling up at him. ‚ÄìNo.</p>
<p>They passed through the living room where the dead eye of television reflected the entrance to a side room. ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want to keep you from working, she said, a hand poised at her blouse, soon held in his, moving to caress and hold, as breaths quickened, hands moved and plucked more urgently where limbs stirred and came down in darkness on the bed as her heat enclosed him hungrily, her legs drawn back [pg219] for the swell of his entrance, her arms raised in a kind of supplication, the pale light from the street sketching her smoothness and firmness no longer an instigation but a reproach to his haggard flesh as he rolled onto his side and she came nestling after to embrace him and press the fronts of her warm thighs against the backs of his.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou poor. You‚Äôre so tired. Just sleep.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt doesn‚Äôt matter. Just sleep.</p>
<p>As his eyes closed his face slackened to a repose almost like its childhood, some mocking semblance of an innocence he‚Äôd inadvertently held through the passing of time and buffeting of experience that had turned it into this lined and sunken parody.</p>
<p>Somewhere within this stricken countenance he wandered in hallways that turned one into another, past WET PAINT and curious figures turning to watch, the corridor narrowing to a closed door where the knob turned and turned unavailing and a waspish voice said, ‚Äìa terrible administrator, lost control of the meeting, thinks you can bury the past, and ‚ÄìPhilip!</p>
<p>‚ÄìHuh, what!</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou were having a bad dream. It‚Äôs all right.</p>
<p>He shivered as she held him. In the streetlight the line of her lip was archaic, without sympathy or flaw, more unforgiving than her youth. He thought of Nan and his heart quailed.</p>

<p>[pg220] Rainless January gave way to winter storms that blew in one after another with no break, stacked like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinyes" title="those who beneath the earth punish whosoever has sworn a false oath">waiting furies</a> over the Pacific, driven to landfall by a jetstream which, satellite photos showed, thrashed like an unmanaged firehose yet somehow kept its business end trained on the Bay Area, so that as the new year wore on what had been the direst winter on record threatened to become the wettest, said the newspaper Quine shook free of its yellow sheath, water falling on the seat beside him, and turned braking for orange cones around a truck EBMUD at a broken hydrant laving the flooded street as booted workmen in orange slickers waved him to DETOUR the wrong way down Codornices, onto a curving road at the edge of town heading into a rain that obscured any landmarks. He fidgeted the radio on to ‚Äìwidely expanded alcohol and drug testi, stilling it for the slap of wipers barely clearing the sheets of water that rippled over vagueness until the Lab gates loomed and he parked under RESERVED DIRECTOR. He dashed through the outer door and in the hallway still rushing overtook two men who didn‚Äôt glance up from, ‚ÄìThou shalt not piss on a colleague‚Äôs funding‚Ä¶ as he turned a corner into ‚ÄìBran!</p>

<p>‚ÄìWell come by my office later, will you‚Ä¶? as he jabbed an unyielding 5 for the blessed but temporary solitude of brushed stainless steel, pulling Ohlone Val from its plastic sheath and unfolding it to Lab Hiring Criticized By Antinuke Group, for a stunned moment ‚ÄìDamn her! and a trail of water tracking him to his office where the radio was ‚Äìworried he was doing to do danger to himself, until he closed the inner door and stopped short of his desk where ‚ÄìConor? sat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThink I found your problem. Disk is all messed up, you should have a lot more free space than it says here.

<p>‚ÄìWell it‚Äôs not a Polish sausage is it. Looks like one of those GIF files they found on the sparta node back when. Want me to delete them?</p>

<p>For a moment a smile flickered there under the set brow and his hand on the mouse fidgeted up a window Reply only to Cancel a moment later at a voice in his ear, dropping his eyes to Lab Hiring Criticized.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, it‚Äôs Philip Quine. I just saw your page one article about our auditor I mean analyst. Would you mind, in the future, would you min very much running this kind of thing by me or my press officer? What? Yes of course he spoke to me. No. No I don‚Äôt have a problem with the. My point is I didn‚Äôt think it would run. Off the rec, no I didn‚Äôt say that because. Because it. Yes all right but. No I‚Äôm not saying that. I think we need to stay on good terms. But sometimes there‚Äôs no good reason to, to stir up shit, you know? No I‚Äôm not asking for, just a friendly call, okay? Just so I know when an article‚Äôs going to. Yes. Yes I will.</p>
<p>He dropped the handset and strode through Dolores‚Äôs office, Valley Herald folded under his arm, harassed by an orotund voice, ‚Äìboth of them [pg224] running on the mantle of reform, into the corridor where he turned left full tilt past E-530 -&gt; to bust into E-533, ‚ÄìSorry I‚Äôm la‚Ä¶ vacant but for the long table. ‚ÄìOh for‚Ä¶ and back around three bends to E-501 and the smell of fresh paint.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChrist‚Ä¶! he exhorted the empty table and chairs. He headed back to his office, waylaid by a placard Diversification and Strategic Management of Laboratory R&amp;D Portfolio, stepping uncertainly into a dim conference room where a small group sat facing a viewgraph harried by the red dot of a laser pointer.</p>

<p>‚ÄìThanks for the rescue, thought I was getting the fifty-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drachma" title="Wikipedia: drachma">drachma</a> course.</p>

Our share of the nuclear weapons market is pretty nearly a hundred percent isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBran, should I be in there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think anyone should be in there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo I mean, I‚Äôm supposed to be in some meeting somewhere, but the two main conference rooms are empty.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm going back to ask Dolores. Did you see this? Quine unfolded [pg225] Lab Hiring Criticized for Nolan‚Äôs outstretched hand. He read it impassively.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn future why don‚Äôt you refer calls like that to me? Anytime you say something to a reporter you can expect to see an unreasonable facsimile in print next day.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I thought, you know, a few months ago they did that flattering profile of the new director, I thought we had a rapport‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìGreer‚Äôs run that paper since we were the biggest employer in the area. Every so often he just has to kick the company store. It‚Äôll blow over.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I‚Äôve spoken to him, I made it clear that we want to be notified of something like this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you leave him to me? Highet tried to micromanage press relations. Did more harm tha</p>

<p>‚ÄìDennis, are you still, I mean, how can we miss you if you won‚Äôt go away?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHi Bran, I‚Äôm glad I ran into you both, have you got a minute?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot really.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis, I‚Äôm late, can we</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo you‚Äôre not, we‚Äôre just starting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, is this the‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, come on in‚Ä¶ to where a half dozen men, two or three of them managers whose names escaped him, sat at a table facing a pale lined projection of a computer screen littered with icons.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is Jerry Seller CFO, Jerry this is Philip Quine director‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease sir. So how you know Dennis?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis was ah our media guru here. He‚Äôs on leave but we still seem to see a lot of him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes I‚Äôm moonlighting I guess you could say. Now before we get started I hope you don‚Äôt mind I need you all to sign this, purely a formality, this form just a standard</p>

<p>‚ÄìSorry I just, my clients need to protect their intellectual property, yes thank you, ah, and, is this everyone? Everyone has signed? as he turned to the laptop and the arrow cursor danced nervously across the projection. ‚ÄìNow if you‚Äôd all just put on these‚Ä¶ as he handed around cardboard eyeglasses with red and green cellophane lenses. ‚ÄìEventually we‚Äôll market this as a standalone flat panel display you can hang on any wall, but we coded it as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/screensaver" title="Wikipedia: screensaver">screensaver</a> as a sort of proof of concept‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚Äì‚Ä¶what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, I appreciate your ah enthusiasm, but we‚Äôre not, I mean, could you concentrate on, on something a little more relevant to our mission here?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell but see I thought this could be packaged as a security enhancement, you know how X Section leaves their computers on all the time, even when they‚Äôre away from their desks and this could be a secure screensaver also a kind of battlespace display for the strategic modeling that X Sec</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook Dennis, why don‚Äôt you get back to your demo, we‚Äôll talk about this later.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut Doctor Quine‚Ä¶ flinching from a raised hand that came away holding green and red lenses no longer confounding the eye but upsetting afresh the mind that had adapted to them, until it came through a familiar doorway to ‚ÄìDolores, get ah, what‚Äôs his name, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%20Jobs" title="Wikipedia: Steve Jobs">Steve Task</a> of aXon Computing for me. I‚Äôm returning his ah, what is it Conor?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHere‚Äôs that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directory%20tree" title="Wikipedia: directory tree">directory tree</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, thanks, and close the door would you. He sat down as the phone blurted. ‚ÄìHello. No Dolores I won‚Äôt hold, get him on the line then call me back, his eyes going blank for a moment in which it seemed he might almost relax before they tensed again to fall on the sheet Conor had left as the phone chirped.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes this is Philip Quine. Yes I know about the problem, I don‚Äôt know why you want to talk to me, this should be a simpl, what? Stan who? Flack? Lawsuit? Patent pending on multiplic, wait, what are you talking about? What do you mean he got us on board? CRADA? With who? Systems Concepts And Methods? No, look, this is the first I‚Äôve heard of. Anyway what does this have to do with the errors, I called because our physics group is getting multiplic, okay now wait will you. Will you please just. What do you mean not an error. There‚Äôs one pair of operands that returns the same error every time you multiply [pg229] them, the same error every time, so, so‚Ä¶ what? On purpose? You built a math error into the chip on purpose? But what do you mean a different algorithm, a mistake‚Äôs a mistake. Infringe on what. Look this is, I really don‚Äôt know how this whole mess I don‚Äôt even know this Stan Flack, but we‚Äôre committed here to building a massively parallel supercomputer with these chips and this is just unaccep. Internet? Users screaming for a fix, well of course they are, what did you expe, what do you mean they‚Äôd never have noticed if we hadn‚Äôt, we, we put the word out? How? Well sure, someone here might have posted to a newsgroup it‚Äôs still your mistake! Software fix, yes, we‚Äôd like that as soon as poss, I, I really don‚Äôt care how much it‚Äôs going to cost you, no I don‚Äôt care about your first quarter earnings we have our, our own prob. We are not to blame for the whole thing! All right. All right then fine. Fine then. See you in court, tapping the cradle for a dial tone but getting instead a waspish voice, ‚ÄìWho, Mister Dial Tone up there? Just wonder how long he‚Äôs going to last.</p>
<p>He dropped the phone and touched a vein beginning to throb in his temple, Quine brought foremost a window he‚Äôd opened that morning:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>as the phone rang again and ‚ÄìSend him in, and through the door came Jeremy Rector, smoothly swinging a calfskin case.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood afternoon Doctor Quine. We missed you at the meeting this morning.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, there was some, some confusion‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Rector sat and his case came open with a snap. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôve seen this? passing him a report in blue covers, <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/110/105356.pdf" title="Statement of Victor S. Rezendes, Director, Energy and Science Issues, Resources,Community, and Economic Development Division">Adopting New Missions And Managing Effectively Pose Significant Challenges GAO/T-RCED-94-113</a>. Quine opened to the executive summary where <em>Experts and agency officials agree that the laboratory‚Äôs new missions need to be clarified if their resources are to be used most effectively</em> before he closed it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes I, I testified that, that the lab‚Äôs new missions have to be clarifi</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs one down. Now about this missing property‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìJeremy, you‚Äôve seen this? pushing Ohlone Valley Herald into [pg230] Rector‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄìWhen we talked about your hiring you didn‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôd worked on the GAO Superbright report.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI assumed you knew. My name‚Äôs on it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course I read it, but that was before I knew your name. Is there some reason your report failed to mention my report‚Ä¶? Quine opened a drawer and drew out An Analysis of False Brightness in the ‚ÄúTaliesin‚Äù Test of Radiance ‚ÄúSuperbright‚Äù X-Ray Laser Component. Rector examined it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI never saw this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet didn‚Äôt give you a copy?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo. There were various classified materials which were summarized for me, but I didn‚Äôt have access to them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause I have to agree with the Herald here, given my own involvement, that GAO report on Superbright read to me like a whitewash.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs I knew the facts it was an accurate representation of what was provided.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt came out shortly after you hired on here, didn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet me think. October? After Doctor Highet had left at any rate.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt exonerated Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìToo late to save his job.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWeren‚Äôt there some other matters under investigation? Something about a shell company.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs I recall there wasn‚Äôt enough to investigate.</p>
<p>‚ÄîWas the company called Nullpoint?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt recall. Look, Doctor Quine, if you have some problem with my work‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, I just, you know, we‚Äôll just hope this‚Ä¶ blows over. Now where are we with this missing property?</p>
<p>Where they were, after an hour, was in a quagmire of missing papers, unfiled requisitions, and slipped cogs of bureaucracy burdened with irrelevances to the point of, if not breakdown, at least a deficit of some forty million dollars.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat does this mean, <a href="http://www.fin.ucar.edu/property/propmanual/propmanual_sec8.html">sensitive property</a>? Classified?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, in this context sensitive means items susceptible to being appropriated for personal use or readily convertible to cash. Cameras, [pg231] tape recorders, tools, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI checked out some classified papers this weekend, if the signout sheets for property are as badly managed it‚Äôs no wonder, I had to go looking for the guy on duty. Why can‚Äôt people just, just do what they‚Äôre supposed to do?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not as bad as it looks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you mean, we don‚Äôt have a clue where any of this stuff went, or how it disappeared.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe way I‚Äôd deal with this is to say that you‚Äôre following DOE procedure</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut we‚Äôre clearly not.</p>
<p>‚Äìas well as you understand it, and point out that other DOE labs have similar problems, or worse. When they broaden the inquiry the pressure will come off you. Now the next thing are these unassigned overhead costs‚Ä¶ as a folder over an inch thick came to the top of the pile.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve looked this over, right? Out of an operating budget of one billion dollars, four hundred million are in unassigned costs</p>
<p>‚ÄìFour hun, forty percent?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, and some interesting liberties were taken with what is accounted for, let‚Äôs see, ten million in defense programs charged to overhead as, ah, Emergency Meal Chits‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut this is, what year was that?</p>
<p>‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal%20year" title="Wikipedia: Fiscal year">F Y</a> ninety-one.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut that‚Äôs, I wasn‚Äôt even, I don‚Äôt see how</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell we still have to address it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes okay Jeremy but I‚Äôm out of time now, I have to‚Ä¶ though whatever necessity was pressing him vanished with the closing of the door onto a moment of stillness that brought not peace but a void, as if some paralysis of the spirit commanded in its train a paralysis of the mind. When his attention returned, it was to the items on his desk. I love you, I miss you. Lab Hiring Criticized. How could she? In his mind‚Äôs eye the line of her mouth, the flare of her lips were set against him, and then they gave way suddenly to another‚Äôs, Nan‚Äôs lips, soft and opening to speak, so present that his breath came short, a taste [pg232] almost was in his mouth, of sandalwood, bittersweet as a pang of longing, or of conscience, her absence from his life now as permanent and irrevocable as the closing of those lips. The errancy of his heart stunned him, and he sat in the aftershock of its protest, not understanding, unable to retreat from its need to pay in full some debt he‚Äôd forgotten.</p>
<p>He held his breath through the ring for her voice, its familiar quaver, ‚ÄìNan Adams, and through another tract of silence almost to hang up on the new voice, flat and bored, ‚Äìis not available. Please leave a message at the tone. Or enter another extension number.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNan‚Ä¶ this is, this is Philip. I, ah, well, would you‚Ä¶ look something up for me? Employee records for a Devon Null. He was in J Section a few years ago. Thanks. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ ah, I‚Äôll talk to you later, returning the handset to its base then standing in agitation to pace the room. He raised the blinds to stare down on the flooded construction pit until in the outer office a voice rose, ‚ÄìHell, Dolores, you know me, moments before the intercom buzzed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho? No Dolores I can‚Äôt spare a minute not even half a, but already a man filled the doorway, black shirt embroidered red and white in Western fashion held closed by mother of pearl snaps and a string tie in a tooled ivory clasp, over which loomed a ruddy face framed by lank graying hair and a smile that held somewhere in its depths the glint of gold. In one fat hand was a Stetson hat, and the other he held forth like a ham.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDan Root. Pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôll have to make an appointment.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI just this minute did.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry but</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot as sorry as you might be. Root dropped his han and took a step forward, still smiling. ‚ÄìSettle down, you‚Äôll make me think you‚Äôre not sure of yourself. Got an ashtray?</p>
<p>Quine‚Äôs hand checked itself on its way to the phone as Root took from his shirt pocket a cigar and a clipper. ‚ÄìI‚Äôd prefer you didn‚Äôt smoke, said Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd I‚Äôd prefer the president [Clinton] go back to Arkansas. Root smiled and sat, leaning to drag over a trash can by its rim as he placed the [pg233] Stetson the desk. He trimmed the cigar and dropped the tip in the trash can.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou kept Highet‚Äôs people on. Dolores and Conor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre good at their jobs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuite a bloodbath I heard. Was it three associate directors went down with Highet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI had nothing to do with that. They weren‚Äôt fired, just reassigned.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSiberia. I know. Root struck a match and held it in the air between them. He raised the cigar to its flame and rolled it there until the tip glowed, then leaned back and looked around the room. ‚ÄìYou want to get some photos up on the wall. Yourself with the Vice President. That sort of thing. Make the place yours. Or don‚Äôt you care about things like that, as his eyes ceased their prowl around the room and came to rest on Quine. ‚ÄìNo, I guess you don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease put that out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis? Smoke rose in gauzy ropes from the coal of the cigar held at arm‚Äôs length until Root returned it to his mouth and the smoke flurred in a complexity almost chaos<a href="#fn125" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a>. ‚ÄìHear you gave R√©ti what for. Want my advice, course you don‚Äôt, but here it is. He may be pushing ninety but he‚Äôs not weak. Give him that asteroid crap. Keep him in the loop on that moon shot. That way you protect yourself, and anyway it‚Äôs the right thing to do. He did real service for this place.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt you think I know that, he‚Äôs practically worshiped here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo should he be, he‚Äôs the creator. What you callin that moon shoot?</p>
<p>‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone" title="Wikipedia: Persephone">Persephone</a>.</p>
<p>Root shook his head in silent laughter.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt name it. Something about going into the darkness forever.</p>
<p>‚ÄìEducation is a damned expensive way to hide from yourself, if you ask me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis advice. Why do you care?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAbout you? I don‚Äôt. But I got some projects on and I‚Äôd rather have you in that chair than Szabo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you think my position‚Äôs that weak.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI surely hope not.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs an interim appointment. I‚Äôm under no illusions. [pg234]</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you not. Root regarded him for a long moment, then mashed the cigar end against the inside of the trash can. ‚ÄìI apologize for the smoke. Filthy habit. See, here‚Äôs the thing. Mister Orrin Gate is a bud of mine, I introduced him to Leo. Figured to set them both up with a good thing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSet them both up?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDual use, give Leo‚Äôs Slingshot some civvy cred, get Orr some tech he could use.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre a friend of Highet‚Äôs?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA colleague. A sponsor. One of his angels. Root drew out a card and leaned to push it across the desk, DANIEL J ROOT Aerospace Consultant <a class="__cf_email__" href="http://www.cloudflare.com/email-protection" data-cfemail="94f0fee6fbfbe0d4ecf2fdfabaf7fbf9ba">[email&nbsp;protected]</a><script type="text/javascript">

</script> ‚ÄìLeo got some crazy notion about Gate working with North Koreans. So he kind of held things up on the CRADA and now it‚Äôs in your hands, is that right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI need to have some aspects of it clarified before I can move forward.</p>
<p>Root spread his hands in the air. ‚ÄìI am here to clarify.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you one of Gate‚Äôs partners? This, this xfin, is that your company?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine, Dennis Kihara wants to see you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDolores, just, don‚Äôt interrupt me here, tell him to see Bran Nolan.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood for you, you‚Äôre delegatin. Highet delegated a hell of a lot to you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs that to you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI like to see the cattle bite back.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay now look, Gate‚Äôs already been in to see me, we‚Äôve gone over this, and I don‚Äôt care if his partner‚Äôs from North Korea or South Korea or, or Canada, he‚Äôs not getting data from that shot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA word from you to DOE would ease our way. But we can go without you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow would you do that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe head of a NASA lab can approve a CRADA.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNASA doesn‚Äôt own this technology.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRight now we just want the data, son. What can I clarify for you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou could tell me what Gate wants with those orbiters.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSee, I don‚Äôt think he knows himself. A wireless satellite net looks [pg235] good to shareholders. But reasons are a dime a dozen, and everybody fools themself. Now Gate, he‚Äôs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon" title="Wikipedia: Mormon">Mormon</a>. A Latter Day Saint. Who believes that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon%20cosmology" title="Wikipedia: Mormon cosmology">God</a> was once a man living on another planet. And that men will become gods populating other worlds.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat does that have to do wi</p>
<p>‚ÄìSee, that‚Äôs the heart of it. The unreason behind his reasons. You want to know why a man does what he does, look to his unreason, to whatever he follows despite all evidence and discouragement. Gate believes in external progression. He wants to go into space because he aspires to the highest places. Look at Highet, you wouldn‚Äôt take him for a believer, but for all his worldly cynicism, he has no use for the mammon of unrighteousness. He‚Äôs a child of light. It vexes him that R√©ti, a Hungarian Jew and a man of science, sups with fundamentalists. His faith in reason is his unreason. Leo thinks religion is ignorance, the enemy of science. But he‚Äôs wrong. Sir Isaac Newton, <a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/bacon.html">Francis Bacon</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler" title="Wikipedia: Kepler">Kepler</a>, Priestley, Boyle, Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell, these were devout and prayerful men who looked for the apocalyptic coming of Christ. There‚Äôs no contradiction. They all wanted to bend creation to man‚Äôs will. To find if the fury in their hearts was God‚Äôs or some other‚Äôs. Why, you have quite a few of the saved right here within your walls<a href="#fn126" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a>. And what better place for them? Are they not stewards?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre a religious man?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI am not. That claptrap makes me puke. And you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt have an opinion.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAgnostic? Looking for proof? Do you think what Bacon thought, that God left his fingerprints on the creation? Then hid them from us like some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cypherpunk" title="Wikipedia: cypherpunk">cypherpunk</a>? Like Leonardo‚Äôs mirror writing?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo opinion.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not saying He didn‚Äôt. But if He did hide the sign of His being, would it not be in the atom? The nuclear reaction is the source of light, of energy, of the universe itself. Isn‚Äôt that why we study it? But Leo never understood that light can‚Äôt conquer darkness. It only pushes it back for a time. Who wants to live in that light? That‚Äôs why we build houses. That‚Äôs why we build churches. That‚Äôs why we build labs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay look, I‚Äôm</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut what do you believe? What‚Äôs your purpose here? [pg236]</p>
<p>‚ÄìHere? I‚Äôm here to serve the national interest.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe national interest! Why, that‚Äôs unassailable. Can you tell me what it is?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAccording to DOE it‚Äôs stockpile stewardship and nonproliferation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs quite a job of work. You got the former Soviet republics bein looted, you got Kazakh nuclear scientists gone unpaid for two years, you got four hundred reactors in the world that by the time they shut down they‚Äôll have produced a million kilos of plutonium. Somebody kicked over the anthill and you‚Äôre gonna keep track of every last ant? You can mess with your sensors and analysis techniques and inventories, but that‚Äôs just playin keep away. Few more years we‚Äôll all be nostalgic for two player mutual assured destruction, know what I mean? So there‚Äôs all the more need now for missile defense, it‚Äôs a perennial, you‚Äôd do well to remember that. Ever since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2%20rocket" title="Wikipedia: V-2 rocket">V2s</a> hit London. Time after time the military studies it and gives it up. But you <em>can</em> hit a bullet with a bullet. To hit a hundred bullets, among a thousand decoys, not to miss a one, that‚Äôs difficult and expensive. But it is possible. The man in the street don‚Äôt care what it costs, he just wants to feel safe. There‚Äôs national interest for you. Anyway we have assets in space. Put assets in space you have to protect them now don‚Äôt you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs really asked the man in the street what he wants.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou truly want democracy on a thing like this? When everybody‚Äôs so harassed by daily life they can‚Äôt think straight even if they‚Äôd ever learned how? Mom and dad both working fifty hour weeks to pay down the credit cards while the kids play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System" title="Wikipedia: Super Nintendo Entertainment System">Nintendo</a> it‚Äôs no wonder you got all those suburban muscle trucks on the road, corner a wounded animal he‚Äôll make a face looks just like that. Democracy? It‚Äôs a miracle they don‚Äôt kill each other. Meantime they just want to feel safe, whatever it costs in the long run, fuck the long run, they‚Äôre living on usury so why not make them feel safe and help yourself to the float? The beauty part is, you don‚Äôt have to deliver the safety, so long as they have someone to blame but themselves.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo money, that‚Äôs your reason? [pg237]</p>
<p>‚ÄìMoney interests me as a force. You know, this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis%20Fukuyama" title="Wikipedia: Francis Fukuyama">Fukuyama</a> fellow with his talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20End%20of%20History%20and%20the%20Last%20Man" title="Wikipedia: The End of History and the Last Man">the end of history</a><a href="#fn127" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a>, the triumph of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal%20capitalism" title="Wikipedia: liberal capitalism">liberal capitalism</a>, I got news for him, he ain‚Äôt even seen capitalism yet. Till now we‚Äôve had the playschool version. Real capitalism is just warmin up. Just you wait. Money? Trillions gone be flyin in the air up for grabs. But I‚Äôm only interested as a student of the world. If money was my thing I‚Äôd buy real estate. Course I want a decent return on my investment, like everybody else.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have to get on with my day.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCourse you do. You‚Äôre a busy man. Root grimaced as he pushed his bulk up from the chair. ‚ÄìOne more thing. Devon Null left some papers here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you know about Null?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou shared office space he told me. Though you might know what become of them papers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know, I never once saw Devon Null.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you not?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot in all the time we were supposed to share an office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSee, Dev‚Äôs a friend. He asked could I get those papers back.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre Lab property.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo they‚Äôre not. Dev had an arrangement. You can look it up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy doesn‚Äôt he come himself?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs not local.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought he owned a business in Tracy.</p>
<p>Root‚Äôs eyes glittered. ‚ÄìDid Highet tell you that? He knew Null pretty well. Maybe you should ask him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere‚Äôs Null now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs a man always had good ideas. Hear you‚Äôve had a few yourself. Ever want to take them outside the envelope? You know, commercial spinoffs. Lot of good ideas here get put on the shelf. Defense contractors implodin right and left, it might be a good plan to look for the next thing, hedge a little.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that what this, this xfin is, your company‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe handle intellectual property, if that‚Äôs a service you need.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is that, exactly, intellectual property?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnything you can‚Äôt fence, eat, or fuck. Root smiled and took his [pg238] Stetson from the desk. ‚ÄìLet you get on with your day. Take good care.</p>
<p>Quine rose as Root left. He carried the trash can by its rim to the bathroom, upended it into the toilet, flushed. The cigar bobbed to the surface and he flushed again, then with toilet paper wiped the rim where ash had stuck. He watched the settling water then flushed once more. As its wheeze faded he listened as if for some other voice, but nothing rose over the insentient drone of the building. In the office he scanned his daybook and lifted the phone for a waspish voice already in conversation, ‚Äìnumber one the leadership issue, ‚Äìand how long till he‚Äôs gone, ‚Äìclassic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive-aggressive%20behavior" title="Wikipedia: Passive-aggressive behavior">passive aggress</a>, hello? hel? and dropped the handset, face burning, heat coagulating into rage as he picked up again for ‚ÄìDolores? Tell Frank Szabo to come by in an hour. I‚Äôll be in the laser bay till then.</p>
<p>In the hallway he averted his eyes from passing faces so evidently occupied by matters beyond human frailty that they seemed at once strained and slack. He‚Äôd planned to walk, to shake some of that numbness from his own being, but when he came squinting into the cold wind rippling puddles on concrete all around the dry fountains, he gazed upward as if to confirm the source of this inclemency<a href="#fn128" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> and in that moment stepped ‚ÄìDamn! into a cold flood up his left foot, his weight on it as if trapped in a mire until a slim figure hurried past him against wind driven drops, ‚ÄìNan! Nan, wait‚Ä¶!</p>
<p>‚ÄìHello, Philip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you get my ah‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour message, yes. I sent you e-mail. There are no employee records for Devon Null.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo records? But that‚Äôs imp, I mean he worked there, he worked in my office, don‚Äôt you, don‚Äôt you remem</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs a file for him, but nothing in it. Just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memorandum%20of%20understanding" title="Wikipedia: memorandum of understanding">memorandum of understanding</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUnderstanding? Understanding about what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, it‚Äôs raining. If you want the file I‚Äôll send it to your office. If you want to talk to me, say so.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I do, I just thought</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have an appointment now, but I‚Äôll be free in an hour.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell okay, good, I could [pg239]</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn the mall, there‚Äôs a place that used to be called Caf√© Desaparecidos.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes I know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a Starbucks now. I‚Äôll see you there at five, all right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I‚Ä¶ but she had gone. Another gust of wind hurried him on to his car, his foot squelching with each step. He drove to a security kiosk, showed his ID, crossed a barren of shattered rock and motion sensors, turned and slowed, anxiously peering down a nondescript stretch of road, continuing slowly on until the edge of a large building asserted itself above a nearby roof. He circled around, found its lot, and parked.</p>
<p>It rose to five stories in places. In the lobby, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig%20history" title="Wikipedia: Whig history">Whig history</a> of lasers led from the first ruby milliwatts down a broadening highway of progress to Avalon, resplendent in artist‚Äôs cutaway wireframe perspective, a million times more powerful than its remote ancestor, though, like so much else elaborated into application here, the basic science had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser%23Laser" title="Wikipedia: Laser#Laser">started elsewhere</a>. At the door to the bay he put on a dust coat and boots, and went into a cavern of white steelwork supports and the skyblue pipes of beamlines. Bernd Dietz, dwarfed under them, looked up from a clipboard as Quine approached. Bill Snell raised a hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWanted you to see this, said Snell as Quine reached them. ‚ÄìWe‚Äôre playing around with designs for the new beast. I think it‚Äôll go.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, said Dietz, turning to draw out a thick glass panel two feet on a side, as somewhere a vacuum pump started up and Quine strained to hear, ‚Äìfor one thing, we need much better glass. These edge claddings absorb spontaneous emissions, and when these heat up about a third of the glass near the edge is unusable. There are also impurities in the glass, mostly platinum from the casting vessel. They absorb energy and lower the damage threshold. Dietz tipped the panel and light glanced from it. ‚ÄìSee? For the new laser this glass will be bigger and will have therefore more impurities. We will need three-omega damage thresholds of fourteen joules per square centimeter. That is far more demanding than what we have here. And you see here, yes? where this glass is already failing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShouldn‚Äôt be a problem, said Snell. ‚ÄìEach beamline has fluence [pg240] near eight joules per square centimeter at the third harmonic. Plenty of margin for error in the specs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd the final focus lenses will be exposed to gamma rays and to neutron energies at fourteen KeV, we have no idea how long they will last. Tests on fused quartz show</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine, we‚Äôve specified type FS one fused silica, and we‚Äôre testing the Corning seventy nine eighty</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, at low energies, around one KeV. The scaling factor I would guess at about two hundred times. At three-omega wavelengths you will see fused silica damage at four joules per square centimeter. Then too the Pockels cell and frequency convert require very large KDP crystals, both deuterated and undeuterated. Probably three times the size of our current crystals. These crystals may take two years or more to grow. Any of the typical impurities, arsenic or aluminum or chromium or lead, these will interact with gamma rays even at parts per million‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, we‚Äôve got what, seven years to get online? You worry too much, Bernd. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôll start by building one beamline.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd when we get that one right, we need to duplicate it one hundred ninety-one times without errors, balance them all to within a few percent, with an aiming accuracy of fifty microns in fifty meters, and I don‚Äôt know what else.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs you see, Doctor Quine, Bernd is a pessimist.</p>
<p>‚ÄìActually, Bill, I‚Äôve found Bernd‚Äôs reality checks to be invaluable.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell of course, but we‚Äôve barely begun‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìReally? I thought Avalon had been on your wish list for several years. What other problems, Bernd?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere is very much more. But one thing at a time. Because the optics coatings are not perfect we get reflections, and these ghost beams propagate through the system, potentially damaging it. Our next activity will be ghost management solutions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBill, your latest cost estimates are already higher than what we discussed in the meeting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, that‚Äôs what things cost. See this? Snell held on his palm a small gold cylinder. ‚ÄìThat‚Äôs a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hohlraum" title="Wikipedia: hohlraum">hohlraum</a>. Ten thousand dollars. I could pay off my car with that. But there‚Äôs a defect in it too small to see, so [pg241] it‚Äôs worthless. Here, take it as a souvenir‚Ä¶ and it went into his pocket to clink against change and keys until his hand found it again to worry as he rounded the doorway into Dolores‚Äôs outer office where Frank Szabo rose to follow Quine inside.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, are we still working on missile defense?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have support contracts with DoD.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs this support coming out of J Section?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt micromanage, I mean, if my people bring in DoD contracts I‚Äôm all for</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust tell me we‚Äôre not remarketing any Radiance projects.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat gave you that idea?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know a Dan Root?</p>
<p>‚ÄìRoot? Years ago we worked together in a group here. Heard he consults for NSA and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Reconnaissance%20Office" title="Wikipedia: National Reconnaissance Office">NRO</a> now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe worked in J Section?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, that was before J Section existed. He and Leo and I worked on some fusion concepts. Laser-plasma interactions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe came by. He suggested that Radiance work was ongoing in J Section.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook Philip number one Dan Root isn‚Äôt reliable. He didn‚Äôt last a year here. He</p>
<p>‚ÄìLike what? What are we doing for DoD?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt really, I‚Äôd have to, probably some laser work‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìX-ray lasers?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, high energy lasers of some other de</p>
<p>‚ÄìSpace based?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou put assets in space you have to protect them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to see paperwork on everything we‚Äôre doing for DoD.</p>
<p>‚ÄìEverything‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìEverything J Section is doing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip I really don‚Äôt think</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen I want every active contract transferred to X Section. Suspend all other work pending a review. Then shut down J Section.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? Philip that‚Äôs not fair, a lot of these people are long term</p>
<p>‚ÄìFair? Since when are we doing fair, Frank? Look, grabbing papers from the desk, ‚Äìdo you see what I‚Äôm dealing with here? Twenty [pg242] thousand inventory items missing worth forty million dollars. Computers, VCRs, test photos, look at this, four hundred million dollars in unidentified overhead costs on no particular program, that‚Äôs forty percent of our entire budget, and do you know, I‚Äôm out of patience. I‚Äôm trying to, to clean this up and every time I turn around another skeleton falls out of some closet, so what happens to a few J Section employees is not a high priority for me, I just want it gone, I want that whole culture of deception and exaggeration dismantled in spirit and in fact.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre still good people, I mean, you were one of them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd another thing. No more Heinrich Hertz fellowships. I don‚Äôt want them recruiting for us anymore.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can‚Äôt tell a independent entity not to give grad students money.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can stop using them as a recruitment tool. We can make it against policy for any of our people to sit on their board.</p>
<p>‚ÄìR√©ti‚Äôs on their board.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe should decide whether he‚Äôs on staff here or with that think tank on the peninsula. If he‚Äôs here he‚Äôll abide by our rules.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou sure you know what you‚Äôre</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust do it Frank!</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen what‚Äôs my reassignment? I know we don‚Äôt do fair here, but I‚Äôd rather not be head of advanced nothing in X Section.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll right. Quine took a conscious breath. ‚ÄìHow would you like to be the Avalon project manager? I‚Äôll create the post. Associate director level.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about Bill Snell?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôll still be head of L Section. Avalon needs its own leader.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you want me? For a moment Szabo‚Äôs hunger and mistrust and resentment stood in a visible equilibrium, and a kind of terror rose in Quine at his own daring.<a href="#fn129" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôve had our differences, Frank, but you‚Äôre a capable scientist and manager, as he straightened papers on the desk and then looked up suddenly as if to ambush the suspicion and hope at war in Szabo‚Äôs face.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd want to talk to Bill about it, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not up to Bill. Quine glanced at his watch and picked up the [pg243] phone. ‚ÄìI‚Äôll talk to you tomorrow, Frank.</p>
<p>After the door closed he put down the phone and stood gazing out the window, past the torn and lakeleted pit, past the dry fountains, to where the sun broke for a moment through clouds, its brilliance surprising the white ramparts of Building 101 and illuminating the people before it as though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon%27s%20House" title="Wikipedia: Salomon's House">Solomon‚Äôs House</a> had risen from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20Atlantis" title="Wikipedia: New Atlantis">New Atlantis</a> and with it these elite and stainless angels of progress, lambent in their moment of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/instauration" title="restoration after decay or dilapidation; renewal; repair">instauration</a>, only to be swallowed again in the sullen shadow of a cloud, like a blessing glimpsed then withdrawn, a grace fickle as the air that sustained it and sent the vision‚Äôs acolytes now scurrying for shelter ahead of its chill, doors slammed and heater punched to HI as he waited through two changes of the light for cars in the turn lane inching forward finally to permit him into the parking lot, where he crept over yellow and black speed bumps past Zany Brainy and REG L C NEM S M X and Linda Evans and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20Economy" title="Wikipedia: New Economy">New Economy</a> Dry Cleaners and œà Psychotherapy Associates, until at Starbucks a heavy truck VANITY driven by a blonde with a phone to one ear backed smartly out of a space, HONOR ROLE PARENT ALISAL ELEMENTARY looming closer and closer between the tires‚Äô inch-thick tread until be abruptly geared into reverse and lurched back three feet to the sound of a horn behind him and his engine‚Äôs sudden stall. The horn blared twice more as he turned the ignition key, and the offended driver shot around him turning sharply into the vacated space. When his engine caught he eased the car another hundred feet to another space and walked back to Starbucks Grand Opening where a line of people stretched out the door.</p>
<p>Up in the gray sky fleeted a ghost of blue. At the door of the caf√© he paused, watching her just inside in a kind of half light before the dimness, the back of her neck aglow where a veil of fine auburn hair traced with gray fell across its paleness. As if sensing his gaze there her hand came up to brush the hair aside, exposing the volutions of her ear before it fell back and she stepped forward into the dimness. When she took her seat he came toward her. There was strain in her face when she looked up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHere, sliding across the table a thin manila folder bordered in red and white strips. ‚ÄìDo you have a need to know this? Or are you [pg244] just curious?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI just want to, as he opened the folder and scanned the single page within, Memorandum of Understanding Between Laboratory and Contractor, security clearance, right and title to intellectual property to be negotiated case by case, glancing up to find her eyes steady on him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat are you looking for, Philip?</p>
<p>His eyes moved down the single page and back up it in a vain search for he wasn‚Äôt sure ‚Äì What? Oh. The university has all employees sign an agreement, a patent agreement, everyone signs it, you have to, but see if Devon Null was only a contractor he could have had a waiver he could just walk out the door with whatever work he‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wasn‚Äôt asking about Null.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you see if he never worked here‚Ä¶</p>
<p>She sighed and closed her purse. ‚ÄìPhilip, I have things to do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo wait, I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis file isn‚Äôt what you want to talk about. Because you could have called anyone for it, had it sent to your office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut yes, it is, I mean</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou won‚Äôt give me an inch, will you? Philip, it‚Äôs been over a <em>year</em>. I thought you would at least call me. Or even come back, once, to say goodbye. But you didn‚Äôt. And I gave up waiting. Why are we here now? Because you want employee records?</p>
<p>Her voice had opened further perhaps than she‚Äôd intended, and her mouth showed its distress at this betrayal of her defenses by the very tremor of those words trying not to say all of what she meant.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, but it was, it was also a reason to see you, Nan‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow little you must think of me, Philip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTo say I‚Äôm sorry.</p>
<p>Suddenly his eyes filled. Hers in turn dropped their guard. After a moment she reached for his hand. They sat in silence for a moment as she regarded him, waiting perhaps for the more that, she seemed now to remember, never came. She withdrew her hand and looked down at it, as if surprised and not particularly pleased at its boniness, the lines in the knuckles, the pale skin creased near a ring.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd now you‚Äôre acting director. I wouldn‚Äôt have guessed it. I [pg245] thought you were ready to have a breakdown or quit. And it turns out that you were maneuvering.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs not what happened.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou stepped over so many people. What a change in you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I, it wasn‚Äôt, have I really changed so much?</p>
<p>Again she regarded him with level curiosity.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, Philip, you haven‚Äôt really changed. You never gave anyone an inch. I just never thought‚Ä¶ but she shook off whatever it was she hadn‚Äôt wanted to think.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut no, I, that was Highet who</p>
<p>‚ÄìI worked for Leo Highet once. He was a jerk, but you knew where you stood with him. With you I always had to guess. When I guessed wrong, you took it out on me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNan‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou were such a, an artichoke, Philip. I could never find your heart.</p>
<p>He glanced away, as if unwilling to encounter in those gray eyes what he‚Äôd failed to see in himself. ‚ÄìAre you well? How are things?</p>
<p>She continued to regard him with that watchful uncertainty. ‚ÄìI‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm short on sleep. There‚Äôs new construction behind my house, it‚Äôs very annoying, it used to be open space, you remember. Trucks come in at six a m dumping dirt.<a href="#fn130" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> You know what a poor sleeper I am. Philip, why are we here?</p>
<p>He looked in agony around the caf√©. ‚ÄìI never knew what you wanted of me. What you expected.</p>
<p>Her face softened. ‚ÄìOh, Philip, I never‚Ä¶ I just wanted you to be, to be what you sometimes can be, just now for such a brief moment, just to be happy in your skin. To be content with, with things.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was, I was content with us. As best I could be. I was content and not content, don‚Äôt you see‚Ä¶ As he spoke he leaned slowly forward and opened his hands. But she seemed resolved now to resist contact. Without moving she drew herself back.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, I‚Äôm getting married.</p>
<p>A stone fell in him. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôre, but I, but who‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou remember Ben. You used him as an excuse to break up with me. [pg246]</p>
<p>‚ÄìNan‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe wedding is in July. I‚Äôll send you an invitation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNan, I‚Ä¶ He blinked in fury, then pressed fingers to his eyes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip. Her hand touched his forearm and he flinched from it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry, Nan. I have no right. I treated you very badly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, you did. But I know you were in pain. Over your work, and more. I could have tried harder. To allow for that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWere you, sorry, when I left?</p>
<p>She seemed to consider. ‚ÄìNo, not at first. At first I was relieved. Not to have to deal with it anymore. Whatever was eating you up. Then I was lonely, very lonely. For months. I hated you then. Hated that you didn‚Äôt call, that you could just walk away like that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was hurting, too.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I suppose you were. I told myself that you were. That you‚Äôd get through it and then you‚Äôd call me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI still hurt. The truth of it went through his body like a shock.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you‚Äôre seeing someone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat young anti-nuclear activist.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow did you</p>
<p>She drew back. ‚ÄìOh, Philip, everyone in the Lab knows. Anyway, you were looking for someone else even when we were together.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I, no, I</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you think I couldn‚Äôt tell? That was what hurt most. She‚Äôs much younger, isn‚Äôt she.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot so much.</p>
<p>Her hand clasped her cup. She said with bitterness, ‚ÄìDoes she make you feel younger, is that it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNan, please‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI swore to myself that if you ever talked to me again I wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ She looked away and sat stiffly in a kind of abstracted misery until she could face him again. ‚ÄìDid you ever really love me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNan‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause I did love you. I felt, all that time, despite everything, all our differences, the distance you wanted to keep, that we held each other in trust. [pg247]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI, and he swallowed with difficulty, his breath was short, his eyes burned. ‚ÄìI wanted to give you my heart.</p>
<p>She sat looking at his face. ‚ÄìYou had a funny way of showing it. No, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sure you did want that. She rose and bent toward him, pressed her soft lips to the hinge of his jaw.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGoodbye, Philip.</p>
<p>The sun dimmed, bled whitely into opal sky. Everything seemed to lose itself in the middle of time. He‚Äôd sat like this, here in this lot, so long ago, when Kate had told him, not unkindly, oh Philip, it‚Äôs too late for us. The moment‚Äôs passed. The same sun dimmed in cloud, the same hollowness. He wanted the pain of it again. Anything but this middle.</p>
<p>Seeking an exit his car heaved over one yellowstriped <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loma#Spanish">loma</a> after another, past Linens ‚ÄôN Things, Blenzers, Leather For Le<span class="math">$$$</span>, Hacienda House, Mattress Discounters, Dent Removers, heading toward the main road but reaching a curb that cut him off from it, turning parallel to the curb past the back of Circuit City where barriers turned him back from further construction to a blank wall and dumpsters where he turned sharply to brake at DO NOT ENTER SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE forcing him into a smaller lot where Ah-d√≥r-no Hair Salon, En-Dev‚ÄôR Computers, Try Us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail%20Bonds" title="Wikipedia: Bail Bonds">Bail Bonds</a> ushered him out upon First American Title and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldwell%20Banker" title="Wikipedia: Coldwell Banker">Coldwell Banker</a> to the promise of an EXIT and NO LEFT TURN. As he stared in that foreclosed direction waiting for a break in the traffic, a woe beyond pain rose in him, at what he‚Äôd never valued enough to feel the loss of, it came to him now, the pent and denied longings of his baffled heart rising briefly to an apprehension of the true scale of his grief, before submerging again into the remorselessness of the everyday and the freeway to Codornic s XIT NLY, and into his driveway where he stilled the car and sat in gathering darkness listening for he didn‚Äôt know what. On some road out of sight was some obstruction, a metal plate or a loose manhole cover, and from it came a hollow thump that echoed briefly as vehicles passed over and were gone, echoed through him like a tocsin of loss. As he opened the car door, wind harried the papers on the seat beneath his hand which clamped them and tucked them firmly under one arm before he dashed through a bluster of rain flung from the sky against [pg248] the door slammed hard on fully gathered night, as he wandered from one room to the next, into the kitchen where it seemed a voice muttered, masked by the refrigerator‚Äôs motor, rising from time to time almost high enough to make itself understood, until the motor shut off, and in its shadow came the murmurous drip of water in the sink, buried then by the whine of the microwave heating dinner, carried with a glass of golden wine to the sofa where at last he settled papers before him, the mutterings of the house submerged in the unattended flicker of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20X-Files" title="Wikipedia: The X-Files">The Truth Is Out There</a>.</p>
<p>Saturday morning came complacently into the house, lingering in the nearly bare rooms, touching blond wood and pale fabric, chrome and glass, browsing at the laminate bookshelf where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20One%20Minute%20Manager" title="Wikipedia: The One Minute Manager">The One Minute Manager</a> leaned in to touch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7%20Habits%20of%20Highly%20Effective%20People" title="Wikipedia: 7 Habits of Highly Effective People">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principle-Centered-Leadership-Stephen-R-Covey/dp/145589348X?tag=gwernnet-20">Principle-Centered Leadership</a> stood up to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Managing-Speed-Change-Daryl-Conner/dp/0679406840?tag=gwernnet-20">Managing At the Speed of Change</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stewardship-Choosing-Service-Self-Interest-Expanded/dp/1620648318?tag=gwernnet-20">Stewardship: Choosing Service Over Self Interest</a> had given over its struggle to hold back <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thriving-Chaos-Handbook-Management-Revolution/dp/0060971843?tag=gwernnet-20">Thriving On Chaos</a> which sat heavily upon <a href="http://tonysmithconsulting.com/personal-growth-philosophy/">Parsifal‚Äôs Briefcase</a> upheld by cassette tapes Remember To Breathe, passing all by to follow the path sick sorrow took, finding Quine out in the kitchen for coffee and oranges by a sunny chair, only to lose him again in the one room that showed, in its dim disorder, anything like life, what Lynn called his mess room, a desk with papers strewn like leaves across its surface, a computer monitor topped by a seamsplit cardboard carton sagging like a heavy bough and beside the desk a banker‚Äôs box DESTROY AFTER and D NULL upended now for a flood of papers folders xeroxes and a curious small white stone figure crudely carved, some kind of dog perhaps, put aside while he sorted printouts, some of them ten years old or more, accordion fold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot%20matrix%20printing" title="Wikipedia: Dot matrix printing">dot matrix</a>, perf edges gone brittle, and some faint pervasive burning smell coming from somewhere, not from the papers, not from the house, not from the air, that edge of burning, the halogen lamp was it? but though he wandered out into the fading sun angling through the outer rooms he kept returning to the dim room like a dog to its vomit, searching compulsively for what he couldn‚Äôt name, some enemy, whatever but himself that had brought him to this pass, sorting through the box of papers he‚Äôd checked out of the vault, Superbright materials, the same he‚Äôd been immersed in during the worst year of [pg249] his life, drawn again into that intensity, into a sense that he was still a part of all that he might have been, while the yellow legal pad Stewardship Notes he‚Äôd set out to map the Lab‚Äôs future and his own was gradually covered over by the past, while outside the drone of rain, the chirping of some bird, the hiss of passing tires went mostly unnoticed until the drone imperceptibly tapered off into a silence more indifferent than accusing yet he looked up in alarm from his preoccupation out to where shafts of setting sun pinned a tanbark oak, green and shot through with redness, against a slategray sky, pinning too his distanced gaze to this offhand splendor in a kind of panic, so he felt like someone moved from his proper time and place, as though this unlooked for appearance and imminent fleeing of sunlight, like that casual flock of pigeons sinking in the isolation of the sky, were a threat as palpable as the wineglass in his hand coming down golden and heavy and refracting cusps of lamplight onto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles%20of%20Incorporation" title="Wikipedia: Articles of Incorporation">Articles of Incorporation</a> Nullpoint Systems, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%20Corporation" title="Wikipedia: S Corporation">S Corporation</a>, shareholders Aron R√©ti Daniel J Root Leo H Highet.</p>
<p>He woke on the sofa in dimness threaded with rain sound, from a dream of Nan standing in halflight before some darker interior, her hand coming up slowly to brush aside a veil of auburn hair as she turned to face him, a smell of sandalwood from her mouth soft and opening to speak: ‚ÄìI love only you. A sweet bitterness pierced him, as if he‚Äôd never before seen this face, this capacity, herself in her fullness: but time and the limpidity of dream made it clearer than the truth he‚Äôd never grasped, a truth that slipped from him even as he came into the gravity of wakefulness, to the room where papers still waited for his sorting, as if any truth could be found there, until he looked up in alarm at the darkness which again had gathered unheralded and unheeded around his reach for the lamplight which sent cusps dancing through the golden contents of the wineglass now resting on Stewardship Notes with its scribbled lines, its bullets and question marks not yet evolved into cows nor dogs, some five and a half pages of possibilities and questions that were not yet as clear as the truth he turned from in frustration, retreating to the living room where the sofa grudgingly took his weight as he clicked on the television and thumbed away from the onslaught of cued laughter at ‚ÄìSo what was that all about? to a [pg250] music lugubrious with menace, ‚Äìshe will likely be his next meal, on to a tense, ‚Äìphoto torpedoes on my mark, thumb reflexively pressing as he settled into that stupor of abused attention which promised, without delivering, respite from the next salvo of cued laughter at ‚Äìthought I‚Äôd leave it ou</p>

<p>‚Äìyou‚Äôd expect to pay‚Ä¶ for such surcease of thought, for respite not retreat, harried at every step in pursuit of what can‚Äôt be bought, to pay and pay again only to be roused from slumber by this voice strident and oracular, ‚ÄìThen he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewn. And I was afraid, and went and hid they talent in the earth: and lo, here thou hast that which is thine! and if something in Quine were buried in some forgotten place, it would be his heart now groping vainly for what it had missed, but when his eyes filled it was at nothing he could name, it was at the flickering signs that appeared and fled on the screen. ‚ÄìTake therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.

<p>‚ÄìThought‚Ä¶ which returned relentlessly as the sun, climbing now over the unfinished facade for a day or at least a morning free of rain, rose struggling above the ceaseless growling and grinding and crashing below with its <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/descant" title="a talk tedious or at length.">descant</a> of hammering and beeping as Quine held a tissue to his nose and repeated, ‚Äì‚Ä¶phones getting fixed? ‚ÄìThought they were, mine‚Äôs okay, you still having trouble‚Ä¶? as Bran Nolan edged round around some boxes just inside the door and Quine picked up for a waspish voice ‚Äìister Dial Tone? seems to have come out of neutral, beating everybody up over this thing, real passive aggr, with his face reddening for ‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs all this? as Quine hung up, ‚ÄìOh, I asked Frank Szabo for some documents, he seems to have dumped a load on me‚Ä¶ and Nolan dropped a sheet onto the desk, ‚ÄìSorry, don‚Äôt mean to dump any more on you, but‚Ä¶ as Quine loudly blew his nose. ‚ÄìHaving trouble since I took over and the noise outside isn‚Äôt helping it‚Äôs a wonder I get anything done.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI won‚Äôt keep you long, just wondered where Dennis got that tune generator of his, thought it was a little too sophisticated for him, turns out to be some friend of Highet‚Äôs, ‚ÄúAlgorithmic Composition by Rule-Based AI‚Äù, by Leo Highet Charles Hollis and Jeffrey Thorpe, look at the fine print, ‚Äúfunded in whole or part by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency order 4796 under Contract F33615-87-C-1499, US patent and corresponding overseas conventions pending.‚Äù Nice to know DARPA‚Äôs looking out for the arts, I wonder if they know they‚Äôre funding a startup.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you think this came out of the Lab? Is there a problem there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt really care about that, I just think the patent‚Äôs cute. World‚Äôs running out of real resources to exploit, so let‚Äôs commodify the intangible and the unspeakable. Doing a damn fine job of it so far too as far as I can, speak of the devil, hello Dennis.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis? Are you, are you still here?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs my entrepreneurial leave.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you haven‚Äôt left.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have, but I signed back on freelance to help the Lab diversify [pg253] and manage its post-Cold War R&amp;D portfolio, kind of intrapreneuring. I thought I should talk to you abou</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot now Dennis, I‚Äôm</p>
<p>‚Äìbecause I‚Äôve identified some scientific project areas I think you should</p>

<p>‚ÄìLook Dennis, I wouldn‚Äôt, I mean, people here are frightened for their lives right now so of course they‚Äôll look interested in anything that has funding attached, but it‚Äôs not a good time to be‚Ä¶ reaching for another tissue to stanch the tearing of his eye.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut this is exactly what we need, more military-to-civilian technology transfers, see I have a list here, ah multiple microphones as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gunshot%20locators" title="Wikipedia: gunshot locators">gunshot locators</a> with or without tracking surveillance cameras and return-fire weapons, there‚Äôs a chief of police down on the peninsula ready to buy that as soon as it‚Äôs available, what else, a way to shut down auto engines with microwaves, got some real interest from the CHP there, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smart%20gun" title="Wikipedia: smart gun">smart gun</a> that can‚Äôt be fired if it‚Äôs stolen, crowd-control devices, strobe light grenades, sticky foam cannons, subsonic can</p>

<p>‚ÄìA little of each, you know just some talking points to help find common groun</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis I wish you‚Äôd, you know I‚Äôm trying to keep the science separate from the fiction here and</p>

<p>‚ÄìWhat about Justice?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLater as through the swinging office door an orotund voice slipped in, ‚Äìlet‚Äôs put the dots together, and</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs the other thing, Bran?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe need to talk about toxics mitigation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAt Site Alpha? I thought we‚Äôd expanded that area.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can‚Äôt keep buying up buffer zones indefinitely. The plume‚Äôs about two miles long now, but given the complex hydrogeology of the site it‚Äôs impossible to predict how far it might go.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre modeling nuclear explosions and we can‚Äôt model this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe don‚Äôt have quite the budget for environmental remediation that we have for blowing things up. But Site Alpha‚Äôs not the issue. It‚Äôs the new building, as Quine turned to take in its facade swept by a ray of sun against a slate sky.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI brought this up a few months ago, you may recall. Do you still have the files I sent up?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I think, just let me, he rummaged through drawers, opening and partly closing them, coming at last upon a folder, Environmental Report New Construction L-301-92. ‚ÄìChivian-Harris, Soil Analysis, action levels, iodine, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercury" title="Wikipedia: mercury">mercury</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chromium" title="Wikipedia: chromium">chromium</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strontium" title="Wikipedia: strontium">strontium</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lead" title="Wikipedia: lead">lead</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nitrates" title="Wikipedia: nitrates">nitrates</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perchloroethane" title="Wikipedia: perchloroethane">perchloroethane</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benzene" title="Wikipedia: benzene">benzene</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethylene%20dibromide" title="Wikipedia: ethylene dibromide">ethylene dibromide</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polychlorinated%20biphenyls" title="Wikipedia: polychlorinated biphenyls">polychlorinated biphenyls</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile%20organic%20compound" title="Wikipedia: Volatile organic compound">volatile organic</a>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook at the next report.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat, ah, who is it, Boole and Clay, trace levels of, approved and accepted‚Ä¶ what happened, did we clean it up?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen this doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Ä¶ Quine paged to the next folder. ‚ÄìSoil engineer, I can‚Äôt make this out, nuclear density tester misaligned, negative readings, visual approval only, signed T Kuhn Engineer [pg255], well this doesn‚Äôt seem very important, but why the two reports?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a discrepancy, isn‚Äôt it. I thought you should be aware of it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, but Bran, this stuff is two years old, I mean the building‚Äôs up, what am I supposed to do about it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSee, the thing is, a lot of soil was trucked offsite.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA good guess would be that it went to other Credne job sites to be used as fill.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat are you saying? Is that soil contaminated or not?</p>
<p>Nolan shrugged. ‚ÄìMaybe you should take the files home with you, look at them closely.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI really, you know I‚Äôve got enough on my pl</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese reports are a matter of public record. Anybody who bothered to look them up would see something‚Äôs fishy. The CANT suit is tactical, it‚Äôs about our EIS being defective because we screwed up on some maps. So that‚Äôs the lever they use to slow us down, but it could also lead to discovery of material we‚Äôd rather not let out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLike these reports.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI realize the last thing you want is to, ah, dig this stuff up. Despite what the secretary‚Äôs saying about openness. But you realize, this contamination could be out in the community.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe don‚Äôt know that, or, or how bad it is, and even if we did, we don‚Äôt know where it is.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs true.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo what are you suggesting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMe? I‚Äôm not suggesting anything.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI mean it‚Äôs Boniface‚Äôs job to handle this stuff, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, Boniface is usually content to let a press release be his umbrella. But if that‚Äôs what you want‚Ä¶ as Nolan went out the door past, ‚Äìlies being perpetated, and Quine followed to pause at Dolores‚Äôs desk for her quizzical look over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Wants-You-Rich-Spiritual/dp/1416549277?tag=gwernnet-20">God Wants You To Be Rich</a><a href="#fn132" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> while she turned down ‚Äìto error is human‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen‚Äôs my next appointment, Dolores?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJeremy Rector at two.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, until then see that I‚Äôm not disturbed, and that especially includes Dennis Kihara, returning to, as she turned up ‚Äìhis own petty [pg256] fiefdom‚Ä¶ or if not that at least a temporary sanctum, where he sat heavily, unfolding Ohlone Valley herald to his name striking at him like a venomous barb, <em>Interim director Philip Quine defended the hiring of Jeremy Rector, former auditor with the General Accounting Office. Rector supervised a report that critics downplayed the Lab‚Äôs exaggerated claims for the Superbright x-ray laser. Quine said he did not hire Rector but said he was ‚Äúthe most qualified person‚Äù for the Lab job and had ‚Äúno conflict of interest‚Äù.</em></p>
<p>He tapped MEM 2 for, ‚ÄìYou‚Äôve reached the offices of Citizens Against Nuclear Technology. If you know your party‚Äôs, pressing 303 for ‚ÄìLynn Hamlin. Is not in her office. Please, hanging up just as the phone buzzed for Dolores‚Äôs voice, ‚ÄìSenator Chase is here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe says he‚Äôs sorry to come by without an appointment, but do you have time</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus Chr, yes, all right, give me, just one, one‚Ä¶ as he held the phone away for the gathering force of a sneeze, ‚ÄìDamn! and smatters of mucus on the mouthpiece, the Herald, his right palm, as he blotted frantically with a tattered tissue the papers he swept into a half opened drawer, dropping the herald in the trash can as he wiped his palm on its edge, leaving the desk bare except for 1994-1999 Institutional Plan and a small gold cylinder just as the inner door opened to a gray suit, crisply pressed, navy and red striped tie the only color below a patrician face clean as a scraped parchment, sharp nose and tapered chin at the point of a wide jaw, gray hair as impeccable as the suit, eyes that same color of a worn coin, taking in Quine‚Äôs worth as the thin mouth almost smiled. With Chase was a young aide, tall and sallow.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine, it‚Äôs a pleasure. Hard to believe you‚Äôve been here all these months and I haven‚Äôt visited.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator its it‚Äôs quite a, a‚Ä¶ as he came around the desk half extended a hand then feinting and gesturing with it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease sit down.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry to pop in like this, but I had a gap in my schedule so I thought I‚Äôd pay my respects. See how you‚Äôre getting on.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, it‚Äôs, as you know, it‚Äôs a challenging job.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs what staff is for, right, Kevin? turning not at all to the [pg257] blankeyed aide. Chase walked to the window and looked out on the unfinished building, currently in shadow against vividly green hills swept with dapples of sunlight. ‚ÄìQuite a view. All the way to Mount Ohlone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I, it‚Äôs quite something.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI remember when this was all open space. When I was a kid I used to ride out by Camp Jepson. Before the Lab. A long time ago. A different world. Chase continued staring out. ‚ÄìI care about this region. I care about the Lab. I‚Äôve watched both grow all my life. I think the Lab is good for the region, the region needs‚Ä¶ although the coincolored eyes narrowed on the scene they‚Äôd once embraced with gladness and trust, a scene now hard to make out under the decades of growth and the striving after some good also hard to identify under its accumulated necessities. Chase gave it up and turned back to the room. ‚ÄìBut not the Lab as it‚Äôs been run lately. My top priority now is to restore trust in the Lab‚Äôs credibility. Kevin?</p>
<p>The aide came to life. ‚ÄìThe secretary of energy is going to announce science based stockpile stewardship as part of the FY ninety-five budget. Next month the Appropriations Committee is going to hear testimony about the program and nonproliferation. The senator would like you to testify about the need for certain program elements, particularly the Avalon laser and its importance in the continued absence of testing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI just got back from Washington, Senator. I have a, a lot on my, my‚Ä¶ Quine reached for a tissue.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I know it‚Äôs a pain in the neck. How‚Äôs everything going for you here?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, quite well. we‚Äôre doing quite, quite well with our, our civilian missions, with our CRADAs, we have quite a few success stories‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDual use.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre calling it dual benefit now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs a faction in Congress going after federal programs with a meat axe. They‚Äôre zealots. They want to abolish whole departments. Health and Human Services, Education, Energy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey, they can‚Äôt be serious, can they? Energy? Who would manage the weapons? [pg258]</p>
<p>‚ÄìDepartment of Defense. We don‚Äôt want that. We want the university to continue managing the Lab because it attracts top talent and it provides an atmosphere of intellectual honesty. Your predecessor did a lot to damage the Lab‚Äôs credibility on the Hill. As long as the Lab is perceived as some poorly managed vestige of an earlier time, it‚Äôs vulnerable to these attacks. If, however, we present a vigorous new Lab with a new post-Cold War mission that requires its scientific expertise, we can resist these attacks. Are we on the same page?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I think that‚Äôs, I mean yes, I would support‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo my question is, is Avalon and science-based stewardship the best way to accomplish the goal of safeguarding our nuclear stockpile?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, of course we‚Äôve discussed other options, sampling, remanufacturing, but in terms of, of attracting talent, expertise, of keeping our scientists interested, I think, in light of what you‚Äôve said, I think it‚Äôs clear that the Lab, the Lab‚Äôs future requires Avalon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood. Then you‚Äôll say as much in Washington?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf that‚Äôs what, yes, sure, I, and I, I ought to explain the dual benefit element‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe dual, you know, inertial confinement fusion‚Ä¶? Quine looked at the gold cylinder on his desk, as if at a talisman or totem. Chase followed his gaze incuriously for a second. ‚ÄìWe‚Äôll be igniting deuterium and tritium in a fusion reaction. That‚Äôs essential to stewardship, because only that produces the same high energy physics regime as a thermonuclear blast, and it‚Äôs really the, the only way to do it without testing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood. That‚Äôs exactly what I want to</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut it could also lead to commercial fusion power‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course I don‚Äôt want to tell you what to say. Mention that if you like, but we‚Äôve been funding that since the fifties and I‚Äôm not holding my breath waiting for the lights to come on.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but, but there‚Äôve been substantial advances, and of course it may reassure those who see only weapons app, oops, excuse me, let me get, as Quine picked up the phone for, ‚ÄìMiss Hamlin is downstairs with a visitor‚Äôs pass.</p>
<p>To Quine‚Äôs helpless look, Chase offered, ‚ÄìI won‚Äôt keep you much longer. [pg259]</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, all right Dolores, tell them, just, send her up. Sorry, you were‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI assume there are people here upset about the end of testing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan you manage them?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre the clean break. Do you have a problem being the bad guy? Because that‚Äôs not the impression I got from your Taliesin report.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can do it if I have to. It‚Äôs not something i enjoy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood. That was a problem with your predecessor, he enjoyed it.</p>
<p>The office door swung open and Chase‚Äôs pale eyes went to Lynn for a moment, then back to Quine. Chase turned and extended his hand to ‚ÄìLynn, what a surprise. I never thought I‚Äôd see you inside the gates.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know each other? said Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, Lynn and I are old campaigners.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator. Her face had reddened. Chase for a moment indulged the ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine and I are doing a little horse trading.</p>
<p>She shot Quine a look. ‚ÄìI‚Äôll leave you then. Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, please, stay, said Chase. ‚ÄìIt saves me a trip. I was going straight to your office after this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes I, I was planning to meet you there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, here‚Äôs what I have for you. The secretary is almost surely going to approve the Avalon facility. The president thinks it‚Äôs our best shot at getting the comprehensive test ban treaty ratified.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut no. Any signal that the US isn‚Äôt serious about reducing its arsenal will jeopardize both the CTBT and the nonproliferation treaty renewal next year<a href="#fn133" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a>. I‚Äôve been to Geneva, you should talk to the Indian delegation or the Pakistanis or even the Israelis, because it‚Äôs crystal clear to them, they see the stewardship program as bad faith, as a way for the declared nuclear states to go right on developing new weapons. They know we‚Äôre sharing technology with the French and British, technology we won‚Äôt share with them. They see that stewardship is about continuing US nuclear dominance. The president might as well come out and say we plan to keep our nuclear arsenal forever, treaty or not. I‚Äôve explained all this to your staff‚Ä¶ [pg260]</p>
<p>‚ÄìRepeatedly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen what don‚Äôt you understand?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat don‚Äôt you understand, Lynn? The Cold War‚Äôs over. We‚Äôll be down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/START%20II" title="Wikipedia: START II">START II</a> levels within ten years. You should be celebrating.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSTART II is still thousands of bombs. I want to see zero bombs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, you know why we can‚Äôt go to zero. The Nuclear Posture Review directs the Department of Energy to maintain the ability to design, fabricate, and certify new nuclear warheads if necessary.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I remind you what Article Six of the NPT says? ‚ÄúEach of the parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know it by heart.</p>
<p>‚Äì‚ÄúGood faith, effective measures, complete disarmament.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs no timetable.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo the US is going to continue to say one thing and do another. That‚Äôs not just bad tactics, senator, it‚Äôs immoral.</p>
<p>Chase glanced at his watch. ‚ÄìLynn, you know what you get when you mix morality and politics? You get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy%20Carter" title="Wikipedia: Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. Nice man, decent man, very hard worker. He came to Washington committed to eliminating nuclear weapons. He said two hundred warheads was enough for deterrence. He meant it, too. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency%20of%20Jimmy%20Carter%23Strategic%20Arms%20Limitations%20Talks%20.28SALT.29" title="Wikipedia: Presidency of Jimmy Carter#Strategic Arms Limitations Talks .28SALT.29">He worked for it.</a> And what did he get? He got the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGM-118%20Peacekeeper" title="Wikipedia: LGM-118 Peacekeeper">MX missile</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-86%20ALCM" title="Wikipedia: AGM-86 ALCM">cruise</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk%20%28missile%29" title="Wikipedia: Tomahawk (missile)">missile</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio-class%20submarine" title="Wikipedia: Ohio-class submarine">Trident sub</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop%20Grumman%20B-2%20Spirit" title="Wikipedia: Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit">B-2 bomber</a>, and Ronald Reagan as a successor. Chase looked again at his watch. ‚ÄìI‚Äôve got to go.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator, at the very least there should be public hearings about the proliferation issue.</p>
<p>Chase was again looking out the window toward Mount Ohlone. ‚ÄìTalk to my staff, Lynn. Maybe we can arrange something. You realize Lynn‚Äôs trying to make more work for you, Doctor Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs what she does. [pg261]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, see you in DC.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThank you for stopping by, senator‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìKevin? The aide came to life and opened the door, letting in, ‚Äìthe battlefield of the political arena, if I may be poetic, before it swung to and Lynn turned to Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat did that mean, see you in DC?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have to testify.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAbout?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAspects of stewardship.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs wrong, are you annoyed with me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI just‚Ä¶ Quine held a tissue to his nose and blew. ‚ÄìI just wish you‚Äôd told me you were coming.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt want people to see us together.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you worried the FBI‚Äôs going to pull your clearance or something?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt could happen.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere are we going, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGoing?</p>
<p>She picked up Institutional Plan 1994-1999 Draft and dropped it. ‚ÄìThis there a five year plan for us? The time we‚Äôve been together, I‚Äôd expect a little more consideration, not this act that you and I are, are just two opposite ends of a bargaining table. She turned and paced to the window and he followed, looking down at the flooded fountain where Chase and his aide were getting into a black car under a sky dense with the menace of rain. Quine abruptly turned and sneezed and she paced away and picked up the small golden cylinder on his desk. ‚ÄìWhat is this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat? It‚Äôs called a hohlraum. It‚Äôs a, a vessel, for indirect drive fusion. It holds the target for the laser.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt looks like gold.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt is. Laser strike it evenly from all sides and it radiates x-rays. They heat and compress the target inside. It has to heat to one hundred million degrees Celsius in order to ignite. The trick is getting the outer layers of the target to, to, do you really want to hear this? [pg262]</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes. What‚Äôs the target?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA frozen capsule of deuterium-tritium. Small, about a millimeter. See, you heat it so that the outer layers boil away like rocket fuel and compress the center. You want the increased pressure so you don‚Äôt have to heat the entire target to ignition temperature. But the heating has to be uniform, if the target doesn‚Äôt stay spherical, it‚Äôll fly apart. The hohlraum helps even out the radiation, but there‚Äôs always some leakage and nonuniformity, so the lasers have to be aimed precisely. A hot spot forms at the center of the target, the imploding fuel ignites there, and the burn propagates outward. You have to time and shape the laser pulses to pull this off. Nanoseconds. And there are hydrodynamic instabilities that can distort the sphere and break up the hot spot before, before‚Ä¶ this must be boring.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ you make it very clear. Her fingers turned the hohlraum.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe aim is to get more energy out than we put in. That‚Äôs called breakeven. That tells us it can be done. It‚Äôs beautiful, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>She put it down. ‚ÄìThis is your work, isn‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm sorry that I forget that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWill I see you tonight?</p>
<p>Her eyes lost the edge of calculation they‚Äôd had since she walked in on Chase. ‚ÄìDo you want to?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe haven‚Äôt spent a night together since you got back.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have to work, I‚Äôm still catching up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI do too. And I have this rotten cold.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome to my place. Bring your work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo. You come to mine.</p>
<p>The skin of his neck jumped at her touch. Her mouth opened on his. The length of her body pressed against him to turn from his closing arms and quickening pulse with a coy smile and, ‚ÄìLater‚Ä¶ when the light from outside had ceased to challenge the halogen glow on his desk and his eyes and back turned upward as if he could see already the dimming of the sky over the line of traffic joining the freeway behind the smoke from a decrepit pickup hauling yard tools, the sound of horns and motors of one car after another passing him trapped by their passing behind it, craning anxiously past the clicking of his left [pg262] turn signal and the sting of his tearing eye for an opening that didn‚Äôt come before orange cones forced him onto a banked curve and a vacant road stretching like the last avenue toward a wall of cloud dark as slate behind radiant green hills. He slowed before this dire splendor, light tangible as a thick plasma holding its energy for the act of perception that could free it, and he stared dumbly for a minute before turning back into the fierce eye of sunset peering through cloud at a lattice of steel beams now half clad in travertine and bottlegreen glass encroaching on the open land beyond it, past Extended StayAmerica Now Renting and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal%20Entertainment%20Group" title="Wikipedia: Regal Entertainment Group">REG L CINEM S</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX" title="Wikipedia: IMAX">IM X</a>, past those expanding edges of a consensual economic reality that had only an estranged and grudging relationship with its natural counterpart, till he rejoined the line of taillights flowing across the overpass, he hadn‚Äôt thought there could be so many cars, nervously twitching the radio to, ‚Äì<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca%20Mountain%20nuclear%20waste%20repository" title="Wikipedia: Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository">uclear waste repository</a> is a death sentence on Nevada that we cannot live with, silencing it as he pulled into the driveway behind Lynn‚Äôs Toyota <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Tibet" title="Wikipedia: Free Tibet">Free Tibet</a> for a second of JAM blinking blue before cutting the ignition with a dead sound. Coming inside, he saw Lynn on the sofa, papers spread on the table before her, a wineglass weighing them down, an empty plate crossed by flatware.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI ate already, I hope you don‚Äôt mind, I was ravenous, I still haven‚Äôt adjusted to the time change.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìTakeout lasagna in the fridge, you can heat it in the microwave.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, okay, later, I will.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn Geneva I met someone who knew you. Andrew Sorokin? He was surprised to learn what you do now. He said you wrote a paper together once, is that right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorokin‚Ä¶? In Geneva?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe works at CERN, as Quine came forward to take from her a thick sheaf and to hold the hand. ‚ÄìYou should read it, it‚Äôs about the proliferation risks of stewardship.</p>
<p>He glanced at <a href="http://www.e-ipi.net/isri/_media/publications:ag-09-01.pdf">The Quest for Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapons</a> and the familiar name, the twinge it brought.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes well, I‚Äôm kind of under the gun with, paging quickly to Executive Summary, where <em>The construction of large ICF microexplosion facilities in both nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States will give the arms race a fresh boost</em>. ‚ÄìI‚Äôll, you know, look at it when I get a chance but I think he‚Äôs got the wrong idea here, Avalon isn‚Äôt to design new weapons.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo? Look at this‚Ä¶ at the fall of a printout headed Department of Energy Office of Research and Inertial Fusion, ‚ÄìLynn please I get this all day at work, can‚Äôt we‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust where I highlighted, and he scanned down the page past Core R&amp;AT Program Elements (Detail), flipped to Concept Design and Assessment where, under a yellow highlight, he read <em>Concepts under consideration in this Program Element range in complexity from relatively minor modifications in the components of existing weapons to major changes in warhead subsystems, or to entirely new physics designs for a proposed or candidate weapon.</em></p>
<p>‚ÄìLook at the next page.</p>
<p>He turned to <em>new ideas needed to evolve and improve the stockpile</em>, looked down at her set features, ‚ÄìKeep going, and scanned ahead to Concept Design Studies, <em>arising out of the experiences during and after the Gulf War that indicated potential military utility for types of nuclear weapons not currently in the stockpile</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, look, I‚Äôm not up to speed with ah, as he went paging past Physics, Computation and Modeling, Systems Engineering, High Explosives, Special Nuclear Materials, Tritium, ‚Äìah with all the details here but</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy not? Isn‚Äôt it your job?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm working twelve hours a day but my God there‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of pages of this stuff, I read what I have to but my God</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs so difficult to understand, they‚Äôre saying one thing in public and here they‚Äôre saying another, ‚Äúentirely new physics designs‚Äù, did you see that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but look these are concept designs, it, here, it says right here a concept is supported by the Program Element only through a proof of principle demonstration, and, and at such time that a new concept matures to the point of inclusion in a formal directed study, see, what it means is</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip I can read I know what it means, it means they‚Äôre playing a [pg265] shell game and not including new weapons under stewardship proper. But they‚Äôre still doing it and reserving the right to transfer it at any time.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell but concept studies are</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a program element! It‚Äôs core research!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere did you get this, anyway?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs on the DOE‚Äôs public server.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo how incriminating is that? Out in the open, why would they put it on the server if‚Ä¶ as he flipped the pages shut, reading in the upper corner <code>ftp://dp.doe.gov/dp-10/dp-11/detail.11</code>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs there by mistake. They‚Äôre shoveling documents online to comply with the vice president‚Äôs National Information Infrastructure program. But we have it now and it shows what DOE really means by stewardship.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou ah, you didn‚Äôt use the word stewardship in Geneva, did you? Because it‚Äôs still, you know, the program hasn‚Äôt been announced‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh Philip, everyone knows, even Chase said it, you‚Äôve been sharing data with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_M%C3%A9gajoule">French Megajoule project</a>, it‚Äôs practically identical to Avalon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere did you hear that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs common knowledge. Why, what is it, is something wrong? You look upset.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm just, Lynn, I want to be able to tell you things, but not, not if you leak them to the press.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeak? What are you, I never</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe Ohlone Valley Herald is running articles about Jeremy Rector. Did you tell them?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo! But her face turned from him and she frowned at the floor before looking back, her brow darkened by something between anger and chagrin. ‚ÄìI told Tony.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, how could you?</p>
<p>For a moment anguish rose in her face, tossed there in a brief tumult of conscience, and subsided in a blush more shamed than chastened over the stubborn downturn of her lips. ‚ÄìI asked you, don‚Äôt you remember, I asked if you were telling me. If you want me to keep things to myself you have to tell me, you have to be clear, I can‚Äôt read [pg266] your mind.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, this kind of thing, it‚Äôs internal Lab business, I don‚Äôt want to have to watch everything I say to you, you just, just need to exercise a little judgement when you</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry, Philip, but this kind of thing, your hiring records, they‚Äôre not secret, and Rector, you were disgusted by his Superbright report, weren‚Äôt you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut now I‚Äôm taking the heat, and I didn‚Äôt even hire this guy!</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo fire him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I can‚Äôt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy not? Why back some sleazy decision of Highet‚Äôs?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause don‚Äôt you see it‚Äôs my decision now! I can‚Äôt back away from what I said to the Herald. If only you‚Äôd let it be I could have</p>
<p>Again the anguish rose in her face, cresting this time into anger. ‚ÄìDon‚Äôt make it my fault! If firing him‚Äôs the right thing to do, don‚Äôt say I‚Äôve made it politically inexpedient for you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPoliti, do you have to make everything, it‚Äôs not, this is, there‚Äôs nothing wrong here, it‚Äôs, he just knows the, the ropes, you know, it‚Äôs like if you, you can hire an ex-IRS agent to take along to an IRS audit it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs the same thing, it just helps to clarif</p>
<p>‚ÄìMake things clearer than the truth?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm doing! God Lynn do we have to, please, can‚Äôt we just, please, I missed you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>She turned from his outstretched arm, folding hers together, looking away for a moment, as if trying to separate what she felt from what she‚Äôd done. ‚ÄìOkay, let‚Äôs, I‚Äôm jet lagged, and I have a lot to process from the conference. I don‚Äôt want to fight. I shouldn‚Äôt have told Tony about your auditor. It‚Äôs not my fault he called the Herald, but I should have guessed he would. You just have to be very clear with me when you tell me something, okay? Okay? Will you? In her urgency she took both his hands in hers, and that pressure seemed to ask more than her words.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll right, I‚Äôll, I‚Äôll try, you‚Ä¶ what is it?</p>
<p>She pivoted away from him wiping an eye with a palm, slumping forward with the collar of her blouse fallen loose and the weight of her breast a pale curve there within. ‚ÄìI can‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt do this, keep the parts [pg267] of things separate.</p>

<p>‚ÄìCould we just go to bed? Please?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, all right‚Ä¶ waiting then in the darkness for the gurgle of water in the sink to subside, for her silhouette briefly against the light in the doorway before it went dark and the fait sheen of white briefs and chemise against the dusk of her flesh come against him like a furnace, taking his breath first under seeking lips then under her weight sitting his hips while she gripped the hem of her chemise to pull it off over her head and drop it pooling on the floor as he craned forward, his mouth seeking to consume the pale softness offered there, hands eager as hers slipping close to the rising heat and cloistered moistness opening like petals, and her breath on his neck, chest, belly, ‚Äìwait, just lie there while I‚Ä¶ until his gasp as she swung a leg over to settle against the search of tongues coming free in an inarticulate moan sharpened to a cry at the first plunge quickened by her insistence, where the mirror caught the pale blade of her foot clamped around his clenched thighs driving them up the bed to where one hand flung back gripped the bedrail by the air that freshened from the window to a crescendo of rain drumming hard on the roof till its release faded to a murmur to a trickle to a whisper to nothing but the air moving to cool their spent forms in deepening stillness until ‚ÄìWhat! her leg spasmed against him and he came up on one elbow to still her with a hand on her bare shoulder lurching upward against it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn! What is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHuh!</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou were dreaming.</p>
<p>She sat and drew her knees to her chest, looking out into darkness.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you all right?</p>
<p>She shook her head and her voice, when it came, was plaintive as a child‚Äôs. ‚ÄìI couldn‚Äôt think the things you need to think to make it go away.</p>
<p>He waited, then said, ‚ÄìDo you want to tell me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was in a city, some strange city at night, and I couldn‚Äôt remember where my car was, I kept walking around looking for it, and, and I knew someone was watching me. And I knew I was dreaming, but‚Ä¶ [pg258]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, it‚Äôs okay now, but her face in the streetlight was still and stricken by something distant.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs not what scared me. She turned to look at him. ‚ÄìDo you ever dream about nuclear war?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo‚Ä¶ But unbidden came the image of slender rods pivoting to point into the black hollow of a crescent earth, where missiles rose in a silver swarm.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI used to. I‚Äôd be at a window looking at the city. at night. The lights and the bridges. Then a flash and I knew it had happened. Sometimes the dream stopped there, sometimes it went on. A roar. A hurricane of fire. I haven‚Äôt had that dream since I was‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Outside, beyond black glass, sudden light froze the yard in an apprehension of windtossed hedge and trees, a moment that for all anyone knew might be their last, until whatever had moved out there stilled and the floodlight snapped off.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy mother was arrested in nineteen eighty-three, demonstrating. I was sixteen then. Do you remember that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd just started at the Lab. I remember a lot of people blocking the gates.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOver a thousand. There wasn‚Äôt room for them all in jail. The county put up tents at Camp Jepson. It took four days to process everyone. My mother said, even with the overcrowding, the dirty latrines, not enough food, everyone there was positive and caring, she said it felt like a family, like the beginning of a world she wanted to live in.</p>
<p>His hand idled at her hip, gliding across the rise of bone to a softness at the verge of hair where she met and held it with her own, turning her face so that the warmth of her brow lay against his, so that her voice vibrated there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI remember the day I met you, I got up very early to drive to the Lab for the demo. It was still dark, the freeway was almost empty. I took the Lab exit and the car in front of me did and the one behind me did too, and on the access road there was a string of lights ahead of me and behind me and I thought, every single person on this road is here for the demo. It felt so right. Then we passed the mustering area for the police. City, county, state, CHP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal%20Protective%20Service%20%28United%20States%29" title="Wikipedia: Federal Protective Service (United States)">federal protective</a>, there were so many, I thought how can we win, how can we ever win? Abruptly she [pg269] released his hand and pulled back her head to look at him. ‚ÄìThis is what I can‚Äôt tell anyone but you. How hopeless it seems. The reach of his hand fell short as the bed jounced to her sitting upright, her expression remote in the dimness. ‚ÄìMy father was a lawyer. He did a lot of pro bono work, and he used to say, you never win. I think he got some grim satisfaction from that. From fighting the same battles over and over. He thought demos were futile, he didn‚Äôt like my mother going. I started going just to bug him. But he‚Äôd left us by then, he went off with another woman when I was twelve. I was so angry at him. I saw him only twice after that, once he took me to the zoo, a few years later to dinner, and he looked so, I don‚Äôt know, so tortured. So embarrassed. I wasn‚Äôt easy on him. Now I think he was a decent man who knew he‚Äôd done a thing he couldn‚Äôt make up.</p>
<p>She came down on her side, leaning in to him, clutching his probing hand with both of hers, raising it from her warmth into the air. ‚ÄìI think of him when I see you angry, when you don‚Äôt want to talk to me. I‚Äôm afraid of that, Philip, I don‚Äôt understand it, why people do that, break precious things they‚Äôve worked so hard to make. She clutched his probing hand with both of hers, raising it from her warmth into air.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you, and he cleared mucus from his throat, ‚Äìdo you ever see him now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe died three years ago. Philip? She released his hand. ‚ÄìYou never talk about your family.</p>
<p>Her leg came slewing over his and her arm crossed his chest as he rolled from her onto his side, back to her front, eyes seeking in darkness something not visible at the window where circling planes outshone the few stars struggling through the low clouds, listening for something beyond that drone of distant engines but pursued only by the warmth of her voice.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre not close. I don‚Äôt talk to my father.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about your mother?</p>
<p>‚ÄìShe died. I was ten.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry. That must have been hard.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt remember much of it. She was in the hospital, then she was sick in bed at home for a long time. [pg270]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat was it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeukemia.</p>
<p>The fronts of her thighs pressed hotly against the cold backs of his, and her warm bicep draped over his as out in the darkness 11:38 consumed 11:37.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow old was she?</p>
<p>‚ÄìShe was thirty eight when she died.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, my dear. Her embrace tightened around him. They lay in silence for seconds. ‚ÄìWhat about your father?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe was, he was ten years older. He didn‚Äôt. He never. He just, he hired housekeepers. One after another. He went to work, he worked for the state, or he stayed downstairs sitting in his red leather Morris chair.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou sound so bitter. Is he alive?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs far as I know.</p>
<p>She came up on one elbow. ‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt know? Where does he live?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOutside Sacramento. Unless he‚Äôs moved.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo near? How long have you been out of touch?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSince I graduated high school.</p>
<p>She came down off her elbow and embraced him again, pressed to his back. ‚ÄìYou make things very hard on yourself, don‚Äôt you. My artichoke.</p>
<p>His hand came off her. ‚ÄìI‚Äôm, what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip! What‚Äôs wrong? I mean you‚Äôre, you‚Äôre prickly, and you have many layers, but, but your heart is sweet. What is it, have I hurt you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs wrong?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNothing. Nothing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere is. I said something wrong, I‚Äôm sorry. Come back! as the mattress rebounded in a sudden flurry of sheets.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs nothing. I have to‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere are you going?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust to, to the bathroom.</p>
<p>He stood in the dark voiding. Outside a pale light fled across the sky. Through a break in the clouds, the moon appeared full and racing [pg271] like a ship through foam. The view from Persephone looking back toward Earth at that moment would have shown, clustered like jewels in a handsbreath of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius%20%28constellation%29" title="Wikipedia: Aquarius (constellation)">Aquarian space</a>, the Sun and crescent Earth set against the diadem of Venus, Mars, Mercury, and Saturn, but its cameras pointed the other way, downward, like a man looking for dropped change on the Moon‚Äôs bright and barren surface.</p>

The familiar name lashed out from a past that, like so many of these papers, refused to stay buried.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>First generation nuclear weapons (NW) are uranium or plutonium fission bombs, such as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki weapons. They are relatively simple, reliable, rugged and compact.</em></p>
<p><em>Second generation NWs are two-stage thermonuclear devices, commonly called hydrogen bombs. A tritium-boosted fission bomb is used to implode and ignite a secondary fusion reaction which produces most of the yield.</em></p>
<p><em>Third generation NWs are ‚Äútailored‚Äù or ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù to increase or [pg278] decrease certain effects such as degree of radioactive fallout. A typical example is the so-called neutron bomb.</em></p>
<p><em>Fourth generation nuclear weapons are based on atomic or nuclear processes that are not restricted by the CTBT. Their development will be essentially science based. It is likely that the first fourth generation nuclear weapons will be miniaturized explosives with yields in the range of 1 to 100 ton equivalent TNT, i.e., in the gap which today separates conventional weapons from nuclear weapons. These relatively low yield nuclear explosives would not qualify as weapons of mass destruction.</em></p>
<p><em>Considerable research is underway in all five nuclear-weapon states into inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and other physical processes necessary to develop fourth-generation NWs. A major arms control of fourth generation weapons is that their development is very closely related to pure scientific research. The chief purpose of the CTBT is to freeze the technology of nuclear weapons as a first step toward general and complete nuclear disarmament. In order to archive that, it is necessary to implement effective measures of preventive arms control, such as internationally binding restrictions in all relevant areas of R&amp;D whether they are claimed to be for military or civilian purposes.</em></p>

<li><em>Subcritical and microfission explosives. With 1 kg of high explosive and under 1 gram of Pu, it is theoretically possible to produce a highly compact weapon with a yield of several tons TNT equivalent.</em></li>
<li><em>Transplutonic and superheavy elements. These elements are in general fissile, and their critical masses are much smaller than that of Pu, potentially in the range of grams rather than kilograms. The goal is to find a long-lived superheavy element with a critical mass of 1 g or less. <sup>267</sup>108 was synthesized at Dubna last year with a halflife of 19 msec, and <sup>265</sup>106 and <sup>265</sup>107 with halflives of about 10 seconds, confirming Nix‚Äôs theory about stability, suggesting that close to 400 stable superheavy nuclei may be found between elements 106 and 136 and that at least a dozen of them should have halflives longer than 25,000 years.</em></li>
<li><em>Antimatter. Releases 275 times more energy per unit mass than any other reaction. Antiprotons have been captured and confined in magnetic traps. CERN is building an antiproton decelerator. Could be used to ignite subcritical burn of fissile material.</em></li>
<li><em>Nuclear isomers. High explosives have energy contents ‚âà 5 kJ/g. Nuclear isomers yield ‚âà 1 GJ/g. Fission yield ‚âà 80 GJ/g. Long-lived isomers in the region of interest have not yet been observed.</em></li>
<li><em>Superexplosives and metallic hydrogen. Could be used to greatly reduce size of fission trigger.</em></li>
<li><em>Pure fusion. The challenge is to build a compact single-use device that can replace the huge accelerator, laser, capacitor bank, or magnet that is necessary for laboratory ignition of fission or fusion capsules. Whether or not a fusion driver such as a compact laser can be designed, ICF experiments with laboratory lasers will enable the [pg280] development of mini-secondaries.</em></li>
<li><em>Superlasers. There is no fundamental obstacle to reaching the theoretical maximum intensity of 10<sup>24</sup> W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Such devices could be made compact enough to have numerous weapons applications, from fusion drivers to particle beam collimators. Their civilian applications are so numerous that containing such developments will be nearly impossible</em></li>

After a moment he replaced it on the desk, turned to the computer and /highet/pgp/ and typed Password: coyote for a flood of files opening one over another until windows too many to count were overlapped with arched brows and sultry eyes and splayed limbs and grasping hands and pouting lips, where lovely Lyca, tanned in the face by shining suns and blowing winds, lay with Rose and Sharon and Lily and their valleys and the hinds of their fields putting forth what might have been green figs hanging from every man with his sword upon his thigh, while in desart wild the virgin view‚Äôd loos‚Äôd her slender dress for the threat‚Äôning horn blush‚Äôd fiery red, seeking only itself to please, naked in the sunny beam‚Äôs delight, pressing with slow rude muscle to deposit the fruits of the gushing showers from pent-up aching rivers, his eyes fixed on the lineaments of gratified desire as he muttered, ‚ÄìWhat, more of these? and the phone blurted. ‚ÄìYes.

R√©ti F. Szabo L. Highet 1974 and his muttering ceased and after a while he reached for a pencil and paper while his eyes remained fixed on the screen.</p>
<p><em>Calculations show that one kilojoule of light energy is sufficient to generate an equal quantity of thermonuclear energy.</em> ‚ÄìBut, one kilojoule‚Ä¶? ‚Ä¶staring at his own scribbles that, impossibly, seemed to confirm it, until he went on browsing into 1976, <em>Calculations show that ten kilojoules should be sufficient to</em>, and 1979, <em>One hundred kilojoules should provide sufficient energy</em>, and <em>Funding for the laser upgrade will assure leadership in inertial confinement fusion research</em>, and <em>Funding for validation tests of our computer models</em>, following the trail of increasing energies and enticing predictions and fiscal years to an apparent terminus in LANCET 1979-1991, <em>Overview: The Lancet series of underground tests has been undertaken to validate and refine x-ray laser codes as well as codes related to the thermodynamic ignition of deuterium-tritium (DT) capsules.

<p>And within this directory was another, /data/, where he found 1013 TALIESIN DOE 911107 ASTS SHAFT P8 80 KT. Columns of numbers. T SYMM PULSE TEMP BURN‚Ä¶ It was the x-ray laser data he‚Äôd spent months trying to square with simulation codes. This was his. What he‚Äôd bled over. But there were columns of unfamiliar numbers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Ignition%20Facility%23Halite%20and%20Centurion" title="Wikipedia: National Ignition Facility#Halite and Centurion">measurements he‚Äôd never seen</a>. As he‚Äôd piggybacked his reflectors, someone had added something else. Every other test in the series the same. Dual use. Attempts to ignite fusion capsules. And these were the roots of Avalon, going back twenty years and more. He stared out the window at floodlights and darkness. A lone figure crossed down there near the dry fountains, his shadow behind him.<a href="#fn140" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Quine kicked off his shoes, moved volumes of FY95 from the couch to the floor.

<p>Again the smell of burning, pungent as a halogen lamp.</p>
<p>Her face in the mirror, intent upon itself, as she combed her long auburn hair traced with gray, falling away from the volutions of her ear. Her serious gaze on him.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Dawn light gray in the room, creeping with its chill into the bed. He drew in his limbs and lay for a moment gathering himself as on the radio a baritone voice lept and feinted over a mutter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabass" title="Wikipedia: Contrabass">contrabasses</a> and a single horn, stretching the syllables of ‚ÄìKar, frei, tags, zaub, er‚Ä¶<a href="#fn142" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> and he groped for OFF finding instead ‚Äìillions of gallons of crude oil have spilled from, stabbing it to silence as he stared dully at the leaves, buds, [pg285] and blooms so mildly and tenderly scenting the air outside his window, no less than the air outside the gates where, sun risen but absent behind a shroud of gray, protesters in a ragged and dispirited group clustered by the roadway bearing signs AVALON BOONDOGGLE and ZERO NOW as Quine, driving past, glimpsed a young woman in the crowd, elbow raised to rest one hand in the russet gleam of her dark hair while the other hand was up in a gesture perhaps meant to rally the others, though she passed from his sight before she completed it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMorning, Philip, said Szabo, suddenly at Quine‚Äôs side as they entered the conference room. ‚ÄìI see Good Friday is April Fool‚Äôs Day this year. It‚Äôs like the anarchists‚Äô convention out there. How many have they got, fifteen, twenty? What‚Äôs that, coffee? Not your usual</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow are you all? I just want to quickly go over our basics, get a kind of progress report from each of you, make sure we‚Äôre on the, the same page as we go into the home stretch on this Conceptual Design Report. I know some of you think the, the language we use is unimportant, but I want to, to fine tune this mission statement based on DOE‚Äôs expectations. First, and I‚Äôve seen most of your drafts, you all know, you should know that we no longer use the word nuclear in our public information. We say national security, special programs, threat reduction, or NBC.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs that, guided peacocks?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou know what it is, Frank. Nuclear biological chemical.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe we should get nuclear out of the acronyms too.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs an alternative, WMD. Weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure, whatever.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, please don‚Äôt take this lightly. Now if you‚Äôd all turn to‚Ä¶ the pages folded back as sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, and each man fixed his eyes there, on the exigencies of words trying not to say what they meant.</p>
<p>‚Äì‚Äúability to design, test, manufacture, and certify new weapons should the CTBT end.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄìMake that ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù, should the CTBT collapse.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt start out with new weapons, start with ‚Äúmaintaining the arsenal‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚Äì‚Äúmaintaining the arsenal and the ability‚Äù [pg286]</p>
<p>‚Äìmake that expertise</p>
<p>‚Äì‚Äúmaintaining the arsenal and the expertise needed to design, test, manufacture, and certify new nuclear weapons should the CTBT collapse‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe still have new weapons in there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow about ‚Äúmaintaining expertise and developing capabilities that would be useful if the CTBT collapsed‚Äù?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, and address, you know, the safety and reliability issues‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDavid, just, just as a matter of information, would you call a pure fusion weapon a ‚Äúsignificant safety improvement‚Äù?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI certainly would. Thermonuclear ignition without a fission primary would be a clear win. Much smaller, more compact bombs, without the plutonium. I hate plutonium. It‚Äôs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium%23Precautions" title="Wikipedia: Plutonium#Precautions">dangerous</a>, its halflife is twenty four thousand years, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium%23Allotropes" title="Wikipedia: Plutonium#Allotropes">it has the ugliest</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phase%20diagram" title="Wikipedia: phase diagram">phase diagram</a> you‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôd love to get rid of it. Of course, since Congress found out about plywood we‚Äôre not supposed to be working on</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlywood?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPrecision Low Yield Weapons Development. An Air Force initiative. Too bad, we had to put a lot of neat ideas back on the shelf for now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs there, is there any more coffee? Yes, could you, thank you. Okay, let‚Äôs go over the Avalon elements from the, from the top. I‚Äôm looking for, for show stoppers. Anything that might prevent us from delivering ignition.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCapsule design and manufacture. If the fuel capsule distorts under pressure, loses its sphericity</p>
<p>‚Äìor if it isn‚Äôt perfectly spherical in fabrication</p>
<p>‚Äì‚Ä¶what kind of tolerances?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs hard to get good data on nonlinearities, but in scaled down tests on existing beamlines, we‚Äôre saying irregularities should be smaller than a micrometer</p>
<p>‚Äìand uniform heating of the target from all directions, within say a few percent. We can overlap beams to smooth the illumination, but</p>
<p>‚Äìhohlraum coupling at about ten to fifteen percent, think we can get it up to twenty, twenty five</p>
<p>‚Äìconfident we can get power in the five hundred terawatt range [pg287]</p>
<p>‚Äìnot just the power you know, it‚Äôs the terawatts plus the teraflops.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCould you say that again in English, Marshall?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe codes have to validate the experimental data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt you mean the data have to validate the codes?</p>
<p>‚ÄìCould we, could we possibly use a different word?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA different word, what do you mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTeraflops sounds like failure. We‚Äôre selling this to Congress.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, but, that‚Äôs the word for it. Trillions of floating point operations per second.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm worried about how it sounds. How about teraops?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSounds like a dinosaur.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it sounds optimistic. Now, is one point eight megajoules enough? Because without ignition, the case for Avalon as a stewardship element is weak.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus Phil, the case for Avalon as a stewardship element is almost nonexistent, it‚Äôs just the hoop we have to jump through.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI hope you‚Äôre not sharing those sentiments outside this room, Frank. The fact is, we‚Äôre selling ignition. Is one point eight megajoules enough?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDetailed numerical simulations predict</p>
<p>‚ÄìAny actual data?</p>
<p>A pause, a look, went across the room. ‚ÄìWell, yes, said Mosfet. ‚ÄìWe did a test series that put to rest fundamental questions about the basic feasibility of high gain and ah confirms‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose would be the, the Lancet underground tests?</p>
<p>Again a look. ‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs right. We, while Radiance was ongoing, as part of the underground tests then, we ignited some DT capsules. Using the blast as an energy driver. We got very useful data on</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve seen some of that data. What I want to know is, did the capsules ignite?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell‚Ä¶ yes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd the codes correctly predicted the conditions for ignition?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, these were one and two dimensional codes, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll refine with the data from Avalon and the new computers. But yes they predicted‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWait. In the seventies our codes predicted ignition with one [pg288] thousand joules, isn‚Äôt that right? And we built a thousand joule laser and it wasn‚Äôt enough. Then we raised our estimate and it still wasn‚Äôt enough. Now we‚Äôre up to one point eight million. Are you sure, Marshall, that our codes capture the physics?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot all of the physics, but, you know, those early codes, they underestimated the rate at which instabilities in the capsule could expand, but we‚Äôre confident now, I mean, our models confirm very well to the experiments we‚Äôve done.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt sounds like you‚Äôve been talking to the skeptics, Philip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to sell this program, David, I don‚Äôt want to oversell it. Marshall?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôve been using these codes to postdict behavior from tests, including the ones you‚Äôve alluded to, and</p>
<p>‚ÄìPostdict? How about just assuring me that ignition at one point eight megajoules isn‚Äôt wishful thinking?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, we‚Äôve already spent our forty days and nights in the desert on this one. There are never guarantees. But under the circumstances, to protect our scientific interests under the constraints we‚Äôve been given, we‚Äôre convinced that we have to have Avalon and that we can do this. You‚Äôre the team captain. Don‚Äôt tell us not to fight.</p>
<p>There was a silence while Quine looked at Ware, then at Szabo, who looked blandly back. ‚ÄìAnything else?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoes anyone know what‚Äôs going on with the new building? I haven‚Äôt seen a crew out there for weeks. If Credne wants to bid on Avalon, I mean they‚Äôre what, a year behind?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey claim it‚Äôs because of the toxics mitigation work DOE required.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought it was those Indian remains they found under the retention tanks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNever know what you‚Äôre going to dig u</p>
<p>‚Äìtribal council in court with the <em>state</em> now, might as well make that pit a permanent feature.</p>
<p>‚Äìbut the toxics, I mean that was a separate contract, didn‚Äôt they start up a subsidiary to handle the waste, Glenn?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt may have happened about the same time. Anyway, it‚Äôs ongoing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh one other thing Doctor Quine, we‚Äôre getting data from the [pg289] last leg of Persephone‚Äôs mission as she leaves lunar orbit to rendezvous with a near earth asteroid. That could give us proof of principle on asteroid defense and we should be ready to exploi</p>
<p>‚ÄìWait, asteroid def, are you talking about Slingshot‚Ä¶.? I thought we were through with all that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have contracts. DoD‚Äôs a customer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile%20defense%23Theater%20missile%20defense" title="Wikipedia: Missile defense#Theater missile defense">theater defense</a>, and national defense are very active programs at Army, Navy, and Air Force labs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought Persephone was for lunar mapping.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, right, the cover story. The mapping was an afterthought, kind of a lollipop for NASA. We‚Äôve got twelve flavors of infrared sensors onboard, the kind that track missile plumes and so forth. And we‚Äôre taking a side trip to impact an asteroid at high speed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìImpact?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the plan.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo we‚Äôre still working on this even though J Section is closed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese things have a life of their own, Philip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWas I unclear, Frank? About shutting these programs down?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have contracts. Anyway, I don‚Äôt think this is the</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, I‚Äôll talk to you about this later. What else?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about this public hearing? Do we have problems there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs just an annoyance. DOE‚Äôs looking to park the billions from the Texas Supercollider before Congress wakes up and takes back the money. Avalon is made for them, the fusion science makes it palatable and the weapons apps make it bulletproof. If we finish the Conceptual Design Report on schedule it should be a slam dunk.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but the weapons part, this, ah, this antinuke group CANT, they‚Äôve done their homework, they‚Äôre going to raise real issues there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTell you what, Philip. I can get some Avalon supporters to come out for this meeting so it‚Äôs not, you know, totally onesided. There are concerned parties inside the Lab and out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWill you be there, Frank?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOnly if I have to be.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou do. Anything else that I need to know about? Anyone‚Ä¶? Okay, are we done? Frank, walk with me. Quine stood last and Szabo lagged to follow. [pg290]</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you hiding projects from me, Frank? Why don‚Äôt I know about these contracts?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause you haven‚Äôt looked? For God‚Äôs sake Philip, there are thousands of projects and contracts, do you want a daily update on every one of them? I shut down J Section, isn‚Äôt that enough for you, do you want to get sued by DoD, too? You know Philip, you‚Äôre breaking everybody‚Äôs balls in there, and for what? DOE thinks you‚Äôre Mister Golden. Not long ago they almost had us all up on charges, and now they‚Äôre waving billions in the scented air. Take the money and screw them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell maybe if I‚Äôm, if I‚Äôm Mister Golden, maybe I‚Äô like to keep it that way and not become known as Highet the Second. Do you know what I heard in Washington, what somebody said to my face? Some senator said, there‚Äôs lies, damn lies, and what Lab people tell you. Okay?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus, Philip, do me a favor, talk to R√©ti, will you. He knows how this game is played, he invented it. Research is expected to lose money. You just have to go about it the right way.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, if Avalon is approved, we‚Äôre only two years from ground-breaking. Not research, not engineering, but actual construction. When construction is complete we have deliverables. I don‚Äôt want to be sitting here wondering how to deliver.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip. I‚Äôve run big R&amp;D projects before. If we don‚Äôt come in on schedule, on budget, if we don‚Äôt achieve ignition right off, these are manageable problems. You amend, you rebaseline. It‚Äôs R&amp;D. This isn‚Äôt the Supercollider, it isn‚Äôt a snipe hunt for some theoretical particle<a href="#fn143" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a>, it‚Äôs national defense. Trust me on this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd where was Bill Snell?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot really his job since you made me head.</p>
<p>‚ÄìL Section is still involved and I want him at these meetings.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, frankly he‚Äôs a little sore but I‚Äôm mending fences. Told him to work on that fast ignitor concept, some nice potential spinoffs from that in the area of</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine! Dolores said you</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh for</p>
<p>‚ÄìCatch you later, Philip. [pg291]</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Szabo are you, ah, well, I can catch up with him later, but I wonder if you remember the demo I gave back in Janu</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe, which one was that, the screensaver?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, the, you know, this Marc Andreessen guy, he started up a company to market that Web browser, I just wondered if you had any interest, he‚Äôs call it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape%20Navigator" title="Wikipedia: Netscape Navigator">Netsc</a></p>

And Quine could see them almost, the domes couched in utter silence at the rim of a crater, near the still point of the turning globe, so that in its fortnightly rotation the sun would hug the horizon, never rising or setting, brushing the jagged mountaintops in that airless clarity, acres of solar panels slowly tracking it, while down below, in the perpetual night of the crater, the billion year old ice is mined for water, oxygen, hydrogen, deuterium, to fuel the reactors that provide heat, power, propulsion. Without the nucleus there is no way out, no way off the planet, no way to leave behind the mistakes, the refuse, the history, no way to transcend the history, what we‚Äôve done to become what we are, no way to forget the mire held aloft in the jaws of &lt;&lt;ULTRADIG&gt;&gt; where something white and round tumbled free before he turned through the gates toward a last smear of sun dying behind a veil of gray that closed over a violet zenith. He hurried up the walk to where a light already glowed within the house.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn‚Ä¶? Sorry I‚Äôm, losing and regaining his balance as she came hard against him in the hallway.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, I‚Äôve missed you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHey, hi, just let me‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚Äì I‚Äôm coming on too strong, sorry I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ backing away to let him pass into the living room, where he set his briefcase on the coffee table.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, I‚Äôm, I‚Äôm glad to, that you‚Ä¶ submitting to an embrace less emphatic but as firm.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI came straight over, I didn‚Äôt bring dinner, are you hungry?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, that‚Äôs okay, I had a late</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to turn on the TV to see our coverage.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf, of the demo? Yes sure, anyway I, there‚Äôs something I want to see too, some PBS guy, Armand Steradian, came to the Lab in January, something on post-Cold W</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe talked to me for over an hour, I think he was really interested in‚Ä¶ trailing off at the sight of a ragged group on the screen, ZERO NOW and a darkhaired woman‚Äôs arm held out in a gesture perhaps meant to rally the others but cut off for a well groomed woman holding [pg293] a microphone, ‚Äìactivists continue their lonely vigil, Pete?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell there‚Äôs my two seconds of fame, I hope Steradian did better by you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I, can I change this now‚Ä¶? and he thumbed to where ordinary citizens were having their heirlooms appraised, all well satisfied that a market existed fo the turning of personal history into hard cash; and although some histories were, by the nature of the market, worth more than others, there were no hard losers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA lot of people didn‚Äôt show up. The Herald reporter was snotty about how few we were.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat reminds me did, did you see this? I saved it in case you‚Ä¶ rummaging through System Design Requirements, Conceptual Design Report Preface, The 7 Habits Of, coming up at last with Respect Fades For Activists, ‚Äì‚ÄúGiven the dramatic changes in the world, even some of the activists‚Äô sympathizers are questioning recent anti-nuclear tactics and positions.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄìI read it. It‚Äôs all we talked about at the retreat. Tony wants to, what did he say, broaden our focus, find a larger audience. We should add arms sales economic justice and social welfare to our menu if it‚Äôll help our funding. Speaks the ad man.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs R√©ti says, funding comes from the threat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll tell Tony. He never met a tactic he didn‚Äôt like. She crossed and recrossed the room, carrying the clipping, setting it down, glancing at the screen, sitting by him only to get up again.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs something wrong?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you have anything to drink?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI think some, some Chardonnay? But wait, it‚Äôs almost‚Ä¶ as he settled onto the sofa for the newly merged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed%20Martin%23History" title="Wikipedia: Lockheed Martin#History">Lockheed-Martin</a> creating an instant history for itself as ‚Äìthe proud sponsor for twenty five years of science broadcasting, and Lynn returned to sit cradling the bowl of the wineglass in her thin long fingers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd I thought Steradian was on our side. When he was a stringer for CNN he talked to us, but now he‚Äôs doing this MacNeil-Lehrer routine, that balanced point of view where you get the secretary of defense and a former secretary of defense. I mean, I‚Äôm sure Steradian thinks he‚Äôs doing the right thing and all. But everybody thinks that, [pg294] don‚Äôt they. I think I‚Äôm doing my job so well and twenty people show up Friday and the Herald disses us and our funding‚Äôs down and everybody‚Äôs on my case at the retreat. Tony said I was demoralizing others. Philip, tell me‚Ä¶ and he looked to her with an apprehension of distress, ‚ÄìAm I fooling myself about you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAbout what you want.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn‚Ä¶ his eyes came up from an F-22 banking against the dun backdrop of a desert floor.</p>
<p>‚Äìestimated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22%23Production%20and%20procurement" title="Wikipedia: F-22#Production and procurement">cost of seventy three bill</a></p>
<p>‚ÄìBut the rest of it. You told me you wanted to make a difference at the Lab.</p>
<p>His eyes, roving for an answer, came back to the screen where a hawkfaced man, ‚ÄìColonel ‚ÄúRip‚Äù Whipple, assistant secretary of defense for acquisitions and development, envisions a day when the military subcontracts information and services from the private sec</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, are you listening‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust a minute‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìCold War over, expect constrained military spending, reap benefits in reduced R&amp;D and maintenance costs by outsourcing to civil and commercial providers and global partners. Military can no longer rely solely on DoD owned and operated assets in order to</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs but wait, he‚Äôs saying the military will buy services from private companies‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo? They do that now, they subcontract.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo but not just weapons, he means all kinds of</p>
<p>‚Äìlaunch vehicles, satellites, space assets, we can outsource these functions</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, but that‚Äôs just what Gate wants, it would be a perfect setup to get</p>
<p>‚Äìfunding from both sectors, spin-offs, spin-ons, and future opportunities, let me tell you a success story</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip would you please‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust one</p>
<p>‚Äìof our partners, 3Vid, developed a three dimensional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battlespace" title="Wikipedia: battlespace">battlespace</a> [pg295] display, spun it off into laptop computers, won the Best of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comdex" title="Wikipedia: Comdex">Comdex</a> ninety three award, and I guarantee you we‚Äôll all have 3D laptops by the year</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, I‚Äôm trying to talk to you!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to know if you‚Äôre serious about changing the Lab. Because there‚Äôs an opportunity. I‚Äôve lined up people willing to comment at this public hearing, to challenge the way DOE is scoping stockpile stewardship and Avalon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you want me to, to do what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTo comment. To tell DOE that they need to explore other options besides Avalon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh but Lynn</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou wouldn‚Äôt be alone. We have a former head of SAC, a former joint chief, a former bomb designer</p>
<p>‚ÄìFormer, well that‚Äôs the word isn‚Äôt it. If I signed on to this I wouldn‚Äôt last five minutes. What good is a former acting director? Anyway, you talk as if it‚Äôs up to me. It‚Äôs not. My job‚Äôs to implement DOE decisions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat good is being current if you don‚Äôt do anything? Your job‚Äôs also to advise. If you tell them there‚Äôs another, better way‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt take a political stand on this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou already have! The Lab‚Äôs a political institution! You play a major role in directing weapons policy!</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, we carry out policy. DoD tells DOE what they need to fulfill their, their goals, and we execute for DOE using best business prac</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet and every directory before him lobbied. You got the neutron bomb in the seventies, Radiance in the eighties, and now Avalon. You‚Äôve always opposed arms control treaties, you</p>
<p>‚ÄìWould you stop, don‚Äôt compare me to Highet, and anyway treaties, that‚Äôs exactly what we, why they want Avalon, so that the CTBT will be ratif</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen Chase, did you even hear what I said to him?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, please, can‚Äôt we, I think about this stuff all day long can we just pl</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen to your own people, you can remanufacture from blueprints, you can [p296]</p>
<p>‚Äìbut to maintain competence, to keep our scientists interested</p>
<p>‚ÄìInterested? Do they have a short attention span?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn it‚Äôs just not going to, I can‚Äôt do this, it would be a total failure.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut isn‚Äôt that, I mean, that‚Äôs all we ever get is the chance to, to fail at something worthwhile! I just want you to take the chance.</p>
<p>‚Äìnational laboratory where cold warriors retool</p>
<p>‚Äìoh but, but wait</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip don‚Äôt you see you have this opportunity, this singular moment when nearly everyone agrees that these weapons are useless and obsolete, don‚Äôt let it</p>
<p>‚Äìwait I, I may be on now, as the camera panned past a bank of equipment and followed a figure walking ‚ÄìWho is that, isn‚Äôt that‚Ä¶? among the skyblue beamlines of the laser bay. ‚ÄìFrank Szabo, but what‚Äôs he, he wasn‚Äôt even in that section then, what‚Äôs he think he‚Ä¶ as the waspish voice was saying, ‚Äìbuilding on twenty years‚Äô expertise in laser technology, this could be the most important thing the Lab does this decade</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs he, Steradian‚Äôs acting like Szabo‚Äôs the direc, as Quine‚Äôs own voice came up to cut him off, his face squinting in the lights, querulous, put upon, ‚ÄìYou can‚Äôt wish these weapons away. It‚Äôs Luddite philosophy to think so, as the camera went quickly back to Szabo, standing inside the laser bay.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs it? he talked to me for over an hour and that‚Äôs, as Szabo went on, ‚Äìactivists may ironically be a greater danger to a test ban than Avalo</p>
<p>‚ÄìLuddite philosophy? Is that what you think of me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? No I didn‚Äôt mean</p>
<p>‚ÄìWish? Does it look to you like I spend my time wishing? I‚Äôm working my tail off! This is so, so disrespectful Philip‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn no no it‚Äôs not, I wasn‚Äôt talking about you, I don‚Äôt even remember saying that, they, they cut me down to nothing, what am I supposed to</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou could say we have a difference of opinion! You could say we‚Äôre honorable people, not know-nothing crackpots! Do you think I‚Äôve spent all these hours reading up on the science because I‚Äôm a, a Luddite? [pg297]</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd Szabo, they treated him like he‚Äôs the direc‚Ä¶ Lynn‚Ä¶? He followed her into the kitchen, where she was paused with her wine-glass over The One Minute and 7 Habits looking at his papers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I, can I see that before you</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy, is it classified?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs why I want to</p>
<p>‚ÄìOur arrangement is that anything you leave out is open.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but since you haven‚Äôt been here I, I mean I know it‚Äôs my fault but could I please‚Ä¶ taking from her poised hand Avalon System Design Requirements For Nuclear Weapon Physics Experiments, ‚ÄìSee, no it‚Äôs not classified but it‚Äôs not exactly public‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI guess not, since the title alone seems to contradict DOE‚Äôs stated policy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut no, it doesn‚Äôt, this isn‚Äôt about new weapons, it‚Äôs about understanding the physics of</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust tell me that Avalon can‚Äôt be used for new weapons design.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell of course it can, but</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut what? Trust you that it won‚Äôt? Trust you like with the B sixty one rev eleven, isn‚Äôt that a new weapon?<a href="#fn144" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs, that‚Äôs an upgrade, we‚Äôre permitted to, but where did you hear about</p>
<p>‚ÄìTrust you? Like with Radiance, with Rocky Flats, with the human radiation experiments?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn please stop saying, but where did</p>
<p>‚ÄìBoth Turner and Sorokin say you‚Äôre trying to make pure fusion bombs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, Turner. Turner hasn‚Äôt worked in a lab for thirty years.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh Philip that‚Äôs so, don‚Äôt discredit him, that‚Äôs what you always do isn‚Äôt it, how can anyone trust you!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWill you stop saying you! That you don‚Äôt trust me!</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry, you know I mean the Lab. But</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd, and you‚Äôve already thrown Sorokin up to me, his fourth gen, you know he‚Äôs guessing about that, he doesn‚Äôt have the data he needs to draw those conclusions, and you know something, if it hadn‚Äôt been for the Lab that experiment of ours would never have come off, did he tell you that? If I hadn‚Äôt come on that Hertz fellowship‚Ä¶ [pg298]</p>
<p>‚ÄìHertz? You were a Hertz fellow?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt was R√©ti‚Äôs idea, he was my advisor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI never knew that. And I thought you weren‚Äôt in the inner circle, but you are aren‚Äôt you, this is how it happens. Denial by degrees so small you don‚Äôt see it happening‚Ä¶ She picked up another paper.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I, can I see</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs this, another of your success stories, hope it‚Äôs not classified, ‚ÄúIn addition to mammography the system can be used for inspection and quality control of materials commonly used in the manufacture of modern conventional and nuclear weapons.‚Äù There‚Äôs dual use for you. Is the mammography part supposed to comfort all the women in the breast cancer cluster around the Lab? Shew threw down the papers. ‚ÄìBut it‚Äôs been dual use since day one, since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford%20Site" title="Wikipedia: Hanford Site">Hanford</a>, dual use and duplicity, plutonium for the bombs but it‚Äôs a power plant too, atoms for peace, electricity too cheap to meter, never mind the cancers downwind, never mind the trillions we‚Äôll need to clean up the mess, forget all that history because there‚Äôs something new called fusion‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn will you‚Ä¶ pausing a moment to shut and lock his case before following her back into the living room, ‚ÄìWhy are you so‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs wrong with you tonight‚Ä¶? where she dropped onto the sofa. The only light now came from the hallway and from where, in the interval between programs, noncommercial television advertised in plain white type LINCOLN, AMERICAN LUXURY, begging the question of whether that slain President had been a frivolous indulgence of the nation or something it could ill afford now that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suze%20Orman" title="Wikipedia: Suze Orman">some toothy woman in a suit</a> grinned and prowled like a panther before a placard that exhorted her unseen but vociferous audience to Dare To Be Rich, before Lynn leveled the remote and with a cocked thumb squashed OFF. In the dark she sat staring at the bleakness of the dead screen. When she turned to him he couldn‚Äôt see her features. An air of desolation settled like some toxin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm so tired of fighting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, I don‚Äôt want to fight.</p>
<p>She looked up at him. ‚ÄìI may not be funded again.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf donations don‚Äôt go up, CANT‚Äôs going to cut staff. I‚Äôll be back to [pg299] part time. That‚Äôs what Tony was telling me. I need this money to go back to school and pass the bar. If they cut me, I‚Äôll have to work at some corporate firm in the city. Nobody else will pay me to do this stuff. I already know as much case law as our lead attorneys but I can‚Äôt practice, I need a place to work‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, ‚Ä¶ He came forward uneasily, further into the darkness where she sat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it‚Äôs not okay! She seemed to draw herself together and set down the glass. ‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not okay, but I will be.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs this happening because you‚Äôre seeing me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo. Tony wouldn‚Äôt be so intolerant. Philip‚Ä¶ could we go to my place?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut why? We‚Äôre here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe always come here. I know my place is small and the street is noisy but I need, I haven‚Äôt been home since Friday morning, I need to‚Ä¶ I just need to be home.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, please, I‚Äôm tired, it‚Äôs so far‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you smell that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs, I don‚Äôt know, like a burning.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? No, I don‚Äôt smell anything‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh this is crazy, but do you ever feel like there‚Äôs something in the air? Something toxic?</p>
<p>A chill went up his neck, as if something had stirred in the dimness behind him. If he stood unmoving it might pass him over.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm cold. Will you turn up the heat? It feels like something died in here.</p>
<p>He turned on a light. The chill of desolation receded but stood by. The thermostat baffled him for a moment, its gray panel blinking 10:22 68F, until he thumbed ^ for a distant rumble lost in a rush of air.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm in such a mood. Come sit here. Relax with me. You‚Äôre always on guard.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, let me‚Ä¶ She leaned against him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs been a hard month for me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you remember when I first came over here? All those times [pg300] we‚Äôd gone out, and you never‚Ä¶ and then I came in and asked you to take my clothes off. I was so shameless.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI couldn‚Äôt believe that you wanted me. He shifted so that her elbow came away from his ribs. ‚ÄìListen, Lynn, if you‚Äôre worried about a job, I could see what‚Äôs open in N Section, that‚Äôs the Nonproliferation Directorate‚Ä¶</p>
<p>She pulled away. ‚ÄìWhat? You mean, me, work at the Lab?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm just saying, if you wanted to apply for something I‚Äôm sure‚Ä¶ but whatever certainty he might have had vanished in her laugh.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt believe you said that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI mean, you have the expertise‚Ä¶</p>
<p>She was on her feet, something between amusement and incredulity claiming her face. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôre not joking, are you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, but, if you really want to change things‚Ä¶</p>
<p>She walked away and turned back to him under the hall light shining russet in her hair, shadowing the hollows of her dark eyes and the deep bones of her cheeks. ‚ÄìI‚Äôm going to take a bath. Will you come up in a little while?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes I, in a while‚Ä¶ turning from the stairs when her feet had vanished to the open briefcase on the coffee table, where Environmental Report New Construction L-301-92, Chivian-Harris Soil Analysis, Boole &amp; Clay Environmental Consultants were pushed aside for a list of Credne Construction Job Sites that failed to claim more of his attention than the television returned to life with ‚Äìmegadittos from a real American woman who, incidentally, isn‚Äôt a lesbian or a feminist.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHey hey hey. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow anyone can watch this idiot‚Ä¶ muttering as his thumb held still for the obese figure asserting, ‚Äìthat means you find me attractive then. See, women who don‚Äôt find me attractive have to be lesbian or femini, as his thumb finally rebelled to move on to ‚Äìcarbon steel blade with Zytel handle, and his attention went back to the list continuing with Credne Waste Management Contract Sites, a few dozen Lab locations, and then, striking at his heart, Estancia Estates.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you coming to bed?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? Oh, oh yes, in, in just a minute, I was just‚Ä¶ looking back in surprise at the papers in his lap, ‚ÄìI just‚Ä¶ [pg301]</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, I‚Äôm crying.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Ä¶? The hall light behind her slim figure, slouched there in white briefs and chemise, rushing him with regret, for Nan, for Kate, for Sorokin, for everything in his life that was or would become irretrievable.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip‚Ä¶ as something new swam into her eyes to regard him from an appraising depth.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you seeing someone else?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? No, that‚Äôs, no certainly not. Why would you think that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know. You‚Äôre distant. I‚Äôm afraid for us.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs just work‚Ä¶ you know I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have something, you know. It‚Äôs real to me. Is it to you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn‚Ä¶ He rose, but she didn‚Äôt move, stood with her arms pulled close around her and stared as if at some future she could pull into being or banish with her next words. But abruptly she shook her head.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry Philip, I know I come on too strong, it scares people, I don‚Äôt want to scare you.</p>
<p>He embraced her warmth. Her tongue filled the emptiness of his mouth. What we want from another is so simple. Almost anyone will do. For a time at least the heart bonds as if it‚Äôs found its other, cloven half. Is this illusion? Something neither commanded nor freely given? If the heart can be so needful and so indiscriminate, how trust it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease come upstairs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes okay‚Ä¶ I just want to brush my teeth‚Ä¶ Water entered a whirlpool, rising and falling around the rim of the drain.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWill you shave for me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHm‚Ä¶? The chalky water cleared.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you mind?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, of course, I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ as he peered closer than he liked at where gray had advanced down his temples to garrison the stubble he now shaved from his face and neck, looking past the reflection to where she gazed back frankly from her seat on the toilet. She smiled as she rose tucking a square of paper between her legs to drop into the bowl. He touched the flesh over his hips, as past their reflection came the lithe muscles of her lean thighs. ‚ÄìI really should, there‚Äôs a gym at the Lab, [pg302] I really should, I just never seem to have time‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was just thinking how attractive you are. She embraced him from behind, staring in the mirror at the rise he turned to trap between them. ‚ÄìCome to bed‚Ä¶ where she extended one arm to raise the sheets for the fall of his weight onto bedsprings, their cramp and creak lost in a sudden drumming of rain on the roof.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, your skin is always so cold.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre always like a furnace, a little furnace‚Ä¶ His hand moved to stoke what grew warmer under it, as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on. Her breath harshened. Hot in his ear her gasp at his touch. Her hand turned on the length of him moving against her and he slid one thigh across the tender swell of her pelvis and paused as a despairing sigh left her.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>She loosed her slender dress as though in desart wild, her face tanned by shining suns, half in shadow, tossing and troubled, as, seeking only himself to please, he pressed down with slow rude muscle, seeing her neck naked and pale in the streetlight‚Äôs beam where it met the volutions of her ear, the strain in her face when she looked up at him before it fell back into dimness. Lightly his hands cradled her head. Deep inside him something drove home and he writhed as pent-up aching rivers, asked for pleasure first, then excused from pain. A dimness like a fog wrapped his consciousness, a languor more suasive than the wetness on his face.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre crying. He shook her hand away. Bone by bone he returned to that loathed self, which could not recollect when it began, which had no future but itself, abyss covered with trance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease tell me, what‚Äôs the matter?</p>
<p>The streetlight was diffused in mist which sent its glow the stronger into the room.</p>
<p>‚Äì‚Ä¶every day it‚Äôs like, like waking up from a, a long sleep, to a world where things have, have gone on without me and I don‚Äôt know how I got here, what day it is, how much time has passed, everything I‚Äôll never, never recover, all that loss, every day I wake up that way and every day the hope for, for something else gets smaller, and I have nothing, just nothing‚Ä¶ [pg303]</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, look at me. You have me.</p>
<p>He turned to her but didn‚Äôt look, as if an open eye would drop him. ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know why.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut it‚Äôs true. Oh, what is it? You look so wounded‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAfter I, after I left Nan I‚Äôd sometimes walk on the mountain. You know, where you took me that night we walked in the moonlight. One day I heard, I don‚Äôt know, it sounded like a lost cat crying. crying with desperate force. It pierced me through. I, I didn‚Äôt know who I was sorrier for, Nan or myself. We abandoned each other‚Ä¶</p>
<p>She cradled him to her breast.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo but listen. A month later I was walking there again and I heard it again in the same place, and I thought, that can‚Äôt be a pet, it wouldn‚Äôt still be there alive. And it wasn‚Äôt a cat, you know, it wasn‚Äôt at all. It was a bird calling, some kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catbird" title="Wikipedia: catbird">catbird</a>. So you see I‚Äôd been living in this, this yes this myth you see, this utopia of loss while things, things had gone on, but in a way it was better to believe in loss than, than in this muddle‚Ä¶ See, the past, you can carry your past and let it drag you under, or you can let it go but then you‚Äôre adrift, the present just, just carries you‚Ä¶ oh my God, what am I going to do?</p>
<p>She didn‚Äôt answer at once. Finally she said, ‚ÄìYou have to quit, Philip. This is destroying you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs all I have.</p>
<p>She held him. When she spoke her voice was dry. ‚ÄìWill you do one thing for me? I‚Äôm sorry I asked you to comment at the hearing, that wasn‚Äôt fair of me. But will you please come? To hear what our people have to say.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf you want. If I don‚Äôt have to, to speak.</p>
<p>A murmur of rain had started again. He lay there in the abyss of his thoughts as her breathing beside him steadied and deepened. Almost a voice stirred in him. It starts before Hanford, it almost said. It starts with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen">R√∂ntgen</a>, with the piece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinocyanide" title="Wikipedia: Platinocyanide">barium</a> glowing in the path of invisible rays, striking out the fire that God had put there. It starts with his wife‚Äôs hand on the photographic plate, its transparence there, the ashen bones visible within the milky flesh. Who could imagine that this radiance at the heart of matter could be malign? That with its light came fire? (Yet from the first the ashen bones were there to see [pg304] within the flesh.) It starts with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri%20Becquerel" title="Wikipedia: Henri Becquerel">Becquerel</a> carrying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radium" title="Wikipedia: radium">radium</a> in his pocket that burned his skin, and darkened the unexposed film. It starts with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie%23Death" title="Wikipedia: Marie_Curie#Death">Marie Curie</a> poisoning herself in that pale uncanny glow. With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest%20Rutherford" title="Wikipedia: Ernest Rutherford">Rutherford</a> guessing at this new alchemy, guessing that matter, giving up its glow, transformed itself one element into another. With the miners at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1chymov#History.2C_mining_and_coinage">Joachimsthal</a>, deep under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore%20Mountains" title="Wikipedia: Ore Mountains">Erzgebirge</a>, inhaling the dust of uranium and dying of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health%20effects%20of%20radon" title="Wikipedia: Health effects of radon">‚Äúmountain sickness‚Äù</a>. With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium%20Girls" title="Wikipedia: Radium Girls">women</a> who by the thousands in watch factories tipped their brushes with that glow<a href="#fn145" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a>, touched it to their tongues before painting the dial face, women who only much later, when the watches‚Äô glow had faded, sickened and died from that radiance taken into their bones. It begins with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest%20Lawrence" title="Wikipedia: Ernest Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a> rushing across the Berkeley campus, the idea of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron%23History" title="Wikipedia: Cyclotron#History">proton accelerator</a> uncontainable in his mind, calling out, I‚Äôm going to be famous! With Oppenheimer at Jornada del Muerte that morning of Trinity. With the scientists who had prised open the gates to that blazing realm past heaven or hell. What were they now at the Lab in all their thousands, but the colonial bureaucrats of that realm, the followers and functionaries, the clerks and commissars? Mere gatekeepers of that power. Or in its keeping. It goes of its own momentum beyond Hanford, to Trinity, to Hiroshima, to the prisoners, the cancer patients, the retarded children, the pregnant women injected or fed this goblin matter to see would it bring health or sickness, the soldiers huddled in trenches against the flash, bones visible in their arms through closed eyes, staring up at the roiling cloudrise, the sheepherders, the farms, the homes, the gardens downwind. And in his sleep the voice long stilled spoke once more. It starts with Sforza; <em>in case of need I will make bombards, mortars, and firethrowing engines of beautiful and practical design. It starts with Archimedes focusing the sun‚Äôs rays upon the fleet at Syracuse, it starts with the first rock hurled by the first grasping hand. It starts where we start. It is mind, it is hunger, it is greed, it is defense, it is mischief, it is the devil, it is the god; it is life.</em></p>

<p>[pg305] Then, all at once it seemed, the sky cleared and the world lay open to the scrutiny of heaven, that skin of blue air beyond which was mere vacuum, below which a scatter of birds turned incomplete spirals, now black, now white, banking into and out of the wind above the pit where CREDNE Waste Management trucks took on their burdens and labored away to parts unknown or at least undisclosed, while from the other direction came a cart trailing two pallets of chrome canisters and turning wide enough to clip the bumper of a parked car, jouncing once as the canisters chimed, and continuing on its way to some project or projects separated from Quine by at least five floors of management passing one at a time until the brushed stainless steel door opened to a vista of identical doors receding in three direction, and he reached the anteroom where an orotund voice proclaimed ‚Äìit‚Äôs a straw dog argum</p>
<p>‚ÄìDolores, would you pl‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs that smell?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt smell anything.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLike, like a burning‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt smell anything. Have a donut?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA creme donut. Have one. They‚Äôre lite.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLight‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre lo fat. She laid down Nanopreneuring and held out a thinwalled box, where a stressed tab and slot threatened to give way until Quine grabbed the sagging edge. ‚ÄìBernd Dietz wants to see you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTell him I‚Äôm busy. Tell him Monday. [pg306]</p>
<p>The box pushed papers across the desk, exposing, like a thorn he couldn‚Äôt pluck out, <em>Nancy Julia Adams</em> and <em>Benjamin Daniel Stern</em> still awaiting the pleasure of is company, or at least the earnest of it, on <em>16 July 1994 RSVP</em>. He hid them under System Requirements, but they emerged unabashed minutes later from Laser Compression of Matter, as he held aloft the doughnut to lose them again beneath Steganography: A Novel Method of Data Hiding. On the computer screen was another thorn still awaiting a response he was as unready to give as to forego.</p>

Subject: Gate URGENT!
WE HAVE TO TALK.
Highet</code></pre>
<p>He clicked to dismiss the window but as he reached a gobbet of cream fell onto <em>RSVP</em> and Earth Protection, and he glared at what was left of the doughnut, grabbed the nearest paper Theodore Turner Comment Preprint to blot the card and wrap the doughnut for the trash, angrily sweeping in after it the stained cardboard box, <em>RSVP</em>, and Earth, coming up then to what, even in the sun glare on the screen, was clearly not his mailbox, pouting lips parted to meet the thrust of his legs up from the chair to the windows to drop blinds against the brightness out there. as the unfinished mauve and avocado fa√ßade opposite vanished behind the clatter he had an apprehension of the hundreds of offices there waiting for their tenants, closeted against the world, of the hundreds upon thousands of offices already occupied, stretching out to Washington, in every one of which decisions were taken in the absolute vacuum of procedure and contingency, and he stood in a kind of paralysis until his phone went off and his door opened.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes? Hel</p>
<p>‚Äìproblem with these civil liberty types, we have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dither" title="Wikipedia: dither">dither</a> the camera resolution so you can‚Äôt read the license plates, but</p>
<p>‚ÄìDamn it! Who‚Äôs‚Ä¶ slamming down to click and collapse the windows on that which men in women most desire, as his eyes came up to [pg307] Dietz‚Äôs white beard, his blocky anxious face, the strands of graying hair fallen forward from the thinned ranks of a moist and mostly barren pate. In hands restless and seemingly forgotten by their owner, some papers were clutched.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI am sorry, but this is urgent.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is it, Bernd?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAvalon. The Conceptual Design review. The budget and time line. There are grave uncertainties here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I know but</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis will be the world‚Äôs largest optical instrument. Seven thousand large and twenty thousand small glass components. The entire US optics industry can produce only two hundred meter-class optics in a year. That is ten times too low for our time frame. So, to meet our deadline we must develop entirely new fabrication techniques which will take an unknown amount of time and which are not budgeted. Also, the beamlines must operate near the damage threshold of the glass. Even if the glass can be made pure and in quantity, even if it does not fail under power, we must then integrate and assemble the parts. One hundred ninety two beamlines must focus to the micrometer with a uniformity of one percent. We build these in a room the size of stadium, so how will you keep dust out of the glass? No one has yet answered for me this simple question.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen, diagnostics. We need new kinds of sensors and new computer codes to fine tune the array before experiments can even start. Then, targets. Frozen capsules of deuterium-tritium must be made perfectly spherical to tolerance of ten billionths of a meter.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd, are you saying it can‚Äôt be done?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI say only that there are great hurdles and our time frame and budget permit no errors at all.</p>
<p>Quine pressed one hand to a throb in his temple, glancing at Nonprolif. ‚ÄìBernd, let me be completely frank with you. We‚Äôre losing funding, jobs, talent. We have to stop the bleeding. If we don‚Äôt complete Avalon right on schedule, if we don‚Äôt achieve ignition right off, those are, are manageable problems that we can address in their time. [pg308]</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut it is my name, not yours, on the Laser Design Cost Basis document. Thirty thousand pieces of glass, do you understand? I will not put my head on that block.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd, none of our groups raised red flags. You‚Äôre the only one.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause they remember what happened to Slater and the others. Have you forgotten Radiance? Highet‚Äôs extravagant claims?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course not. You rescued me. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre on the project.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut Szabo is head.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that what this is about? Because if you want more responsib</p>
<p>‚ÄìI do not! But Szabo, he thinks, if this laser does not work out as planned, it is no problem for him. In fact, one point eight megajoules, assuming we attain that figure, which I do not promise, is probably not even enough. But that is not my concern. I am saying the construction. That is my problem.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy do you say it‚Äôs not enough?</p>
<p>Dietz stared at him with something between dismay and offense. ‚ÄìYou know why.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Dietz looked down at the papers in his hand. He stared at them in silence as Quine waited. At last he glanced up and as he placed them on the desk he barely spoke. ‚ÄìTaliesin.</p>
<p>Quine glanced at the papers. Dear Madam Secretary. A finger of unease uncurled in his bowels. ‚ÄìWhat are you saying?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have said too much. I will not sign the Cost Basis Document unless these objections are attached.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut‚Ä¶ Bernd, you‚Äôre putting me in an impossible position. The Conceptual Design Report has been turned in. If you had these concerns</p>
<p>‚ÄìI told you my concerns! Weeks ago!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat would you agree to? There‚Äôs a fifteen percent contingency. I can budget twenty percent more for the optics if you can certi</p>
<p>‚ÄìFifteen, twenty, fifty percent is not the point! There are too many uncertainties, we must study more, run more experiments on the lasers we have‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can do that after Key Decision One. [pg309]</p>
<p>‚ÄìToo late. Then the budget is fixed. We are saying one billion?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOne point one.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThree, four times that, is my estimate.<a href="#fn146" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> To solve only the problems that I can see from here. I have put my concerns in writing, so there can be no misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The finger inside him pressed harder. ‚ÄìBernd, you have to sign this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOr what? What will you do? Fire me? I will go public!</p>
<p>Quine got up and paced to the window. The pressure in his bowels was desperate. ‚ÄìIf I, if I accept your protest, make it an addendum to the report, will that satisfy you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt will go to the secretary with the report?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes yes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll right. Then I will leave it with you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that all? Are we done?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFor now.</p>
<p>As the door closed he rushed hobbling to the washroom. He had barely sat when he released a torrent into the bowl. He lowered his head onto folded arms as the spasms subsided and a weakness swept his legs. After a minute he rose to wipe himself and flush away a watery yellow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chyle" title="Wikipedia: chyle">chyle</a>, leaving behind a stink more sulfurous than fecal. The fan labored as he washed his hands, and he glimpsed in the mirror as he went out a face paler than normal turning to Frank Szabo perusing the papers on his desk.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs that smell? Like a burning?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry to barge in, but I saw Bernd. He leave this for you? indicating Dear Madam Secretary.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes he, he thinks the Avalon optics won‚Äôt work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs full of crap. You‚Äôre not sending this, are you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI said I‚Äôd include it if he signed off on the Cost Basis Document.</p>
<p>‚ÄìClassify it and bury it. It‚Äôs an internal memo with sensitive information.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I do that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAsk Bran how, he‚Äôs been studying the new classification guidelines. Listen what about this Earth Protection Seminar, are you on [pg310] board for that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, I haven‚Äôt had a chance to</p>
<p>‚ÄìSpace thing we‚Äôre hosting in July, international community, blah blah. Can you give the keynote?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTalk to Dolores‚Ä¶ who looked up from How To Profit From the Coming Chaos.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDolores, those doughnuts‚Ä¶ did you eat‚Ä¶ I mean, are they okay?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you like them? My cousin works for a food company. They‚Äôre testing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olestra%23Side%20effects" title="Wikipedia: Olestra#Side effects">a fat substitute</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSubstitute?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt doesn‚Äôt get digested or something. But it tastes like the real thing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know where Bran Nolan is?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome seminar I think.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRight, okay, I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ hurrying down the hall to pass a couple of men, ‚Äìgoing to launch these things on their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long%20March%20%28rocket%20family%29" title="Wikipedia: Long March (rocket family)">Long</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodong-1" title="Wikipedia: Rodong-1">Dong</a> missile or whatever the hell it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ trying E-233 which opened onto a small group watching a coatless man with tie askew and sleeves rolled up prowling back and forth before a placard Motivating Faster Failure With Peter Paul Thomas, ‚Äìthe great Swedish playwright Hendrick Ibsen and his great play Enema of the People, where Dean Stockwell goes up against the grain of his community to save them from themselves and the toxic plume of distrust corroding the fabric of their society where his news is unwelcome at first until the townsfolk see that it‚Äôs in their own interest to be self-interested, the point being is that they<a href="#fn147" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìExcuse me, Bran‚Ä¶? who rose from a seat in the back in the back and followed Quine out the door muttering, ‚ÄìMust be the hundred drachma course, all this time I thought <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN" title="Wikipedia: ISBN">Isben</a> was the guy who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey%20Decimal%20Classification" title="Wikipedia: Dewey Decimal Classification">invented book numbering</a>, won a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%20and%20Noble" title="Wikipedia: Barnes and Noble">Barnes and Noble</a> prize for it didn‚Äôt he?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow do I classify an internal report?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat section?</p>
<p>‚ÄìL Section.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose used to be born classified, but under the new openness regime I‚Äôll have to look it up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSomething Bernd Dietz wrote. I want it put through an internal [pg311] review.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFax it to me. Do I have your comments?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe document for the public hearing tonight? I know how you like to work over the language, but it goes out at four.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, the nonprof, I mean the nonproliferation thing. That‚Äôs right, just thought I‚Äôd get a, a, a little breather after the Design Report. Okay I‚Äôll</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust send it to my office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes okay‚Ä¶ as a hand went deep into the trash pressing aside a stained cardboard box ALESTRO Test Product S to come up holding between two fingers <em>RSVP</em> and Earth Protection. A gobbet of cream still clung to the hand traveling to intercept the phone‚Äôs bleat, pausing only to ward off, ineffectually, the opening door.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes? Hold, hold on Conor I‚Äôll be right with, no hello go ahead‚Ä¶ out of, of gas? Course correc, isn‚Äôt that NASA‚Äôs‚Ä¶ But I mean after the lunar, why are we calculating the course correc. Uh huh‚Ä¶ as Conor waved for his attention and wrote something on a scrap of paper. ‚ÄìOkay. I‚Äôm still not clear why we were doing those calculations at all but maybe you can explain that to me when we meet. Quine put down the phone and pushed aside <em>RSVP</em>, Earth protection, seeking the more absorbent Ohlone Valley Herald Critics Charge, with which he wiped the heel of his hand and the telephone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat was about Persephone, right? On the scrap in Conor‚Äôs hand was written aXon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat was Tom Young. He said that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars%20Climate%20Orbiter%23Cause%20of%20failure" title="Wikipedia: Mars Climate Orbiter#Cause of failure">NASA failed to convert our units from miles to kilometers</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMiles? Who uses miles anymore?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLegacy codes? Running on aXons? I don‚Äôt think so. I know what happened there. Those guys didn‚Äôt fix their math chips. So their results put Persephone‚Äôs thrusters on full burn and depleted the fuel.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes well, I‚Äôll have to, to deal with it later. Come here a second, as Conor leaned into the screen while Quine clicked LANCET 1979-1991 to open TALIESIN. ‚ÄìI know you have some expertise with Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities‚Ä¶ [pg312]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWow, ignition, burn rate, this is DT fusion, right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese codes model radiation transfer, hydrodynamic evolution of the plasma‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is great, whose work is this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome of this I worked on but not, not this side of it‚Ä¶ see, x-ray energy is pumped into the capsule here‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt know you did fusion.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI, I didn‚Äôt. This is‚Ä¶ just started to look at this really, see, these are the data sets for the DT burn‚Ä¶ here, look at the rho-r values, for the first twenty nanoseconds they‚Äôre going up and with these energies you‚Äôd expect burn to take off, but</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah I see. Instabilities cooling off the hot spot?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat should be accounted for in the underlying code libraries‚Ä¶ as he pushed Steganography aside for Laser Compression of Matter.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe classic paper.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah well, they predicted ignition with one kilojoule and underestimating the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities put them so far off. But the current codes should have fixed that. So I want to know what‚Äôs going on.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShouldn‚Äôt you, I mean Szabo actually worked on this all along, he‚Äôd be the guy to ah</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank‚Äôs got a lot on his plate right now. Anyway this is a long term kind of project, and I‚Äôve heard great things about your expertise in this field, just thought it‚Äôs something you could sink your teeth into‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell definitely, I‚Äôd love to, I just, you know, don‚Äôt want to step on anybody‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet me worry about that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs better that you don‚Äôt know the source of the data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen I know it‚Äôs late but, have you had lunch? Maybe we could grab something, if you‚Äôre not too busy, I can show you the Rayleigh-Taylor work I did last year‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìFeeling a little queasy actually but maybe tomorrow I mean Monday we could, I mean after you‚Äôve had a chance to look at [pg313]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is really great of you, I really appreciate‚Ä¶ lingering to pick up Steganography a Novel Method of Data Hiding. ‚ÄìHey cool. You know I did some stuff for Highet on this, did you ever see</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip where the hell is your summary?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy, my what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHey Bran, how‚Äôs it</p>
<p>‚ÄìMessenger‚Äôs waiting in my office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh yes that page I, I, I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôll, tell him I‚Äôll, ten minutes, I‚Äôll fax it down to you in, in five‚Ä¶ sorry Conor, I have to‚Ä¶ pushing a stained and shopworn Earth Protection and RSVP under the fall of Steganography to retrieve Avalon And The Issue of Nonproliferation, where Part V X-ray Laser Research reminded him that <em>Experiments on nuclear directed energy weapon concepts, while technically possible, are not planned.</em> He read on to <em>X-ray lasers have military applications as well as peaceful ones. The results of Avalon experiments could provide data for comparison with codes and could be used to further interpret the results of past underground experiments on nuclear-pumped x-ray lasers.</em></p>
<p>For a moment he was back in the office he‚Äôd shared with Null in those despised years of Superbright. The loss and waste of it were a hook through his heart. He lifted the phone to press MEM 1 but hung up before it rang. After a moment he pressed another number.</p>
<p>‚ÄìReese? Sorry to bother you. Just want to check something. The x-ray lasers or, or similar Radiance components, are those considered proliferation risks? I mean for purposes of. No this is for, for a possible Avalon application. No, Title One phase, the conceptual Design Report is already, it‚Äôs at the printer, yes you should have it any day now. Really? She has? A, a done deal, well that‚Äôs good news. So, on the x-ray laser, we can pretty much do whatever‚Ä¶ okay then.</p>
<p>He walked to the window and stood in what might have been motionlessness except that it brought no stillness, no elsewhere, no immensity, it brought only a stifling anxiety at the stubborn progression of all he was enmeshed in, so he turned from it as something in him hardened and at the same time gave way, as it might have been the unprovoked slide of dirt down one wall of the pit there below him.</p>
<p>He strode to the desk and wrote: [pg314]</p>
<p><em>Research on x-ray lasers has multiple applications. Therefore, it would be unwise to restrict peaceful research in this area in the interest of preventing weapon development.</em></p>
<p>‚ÄìDolores, fax this down to Bran Nolan‚Ä¶ oh, is that the time? I have to go.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWill you be back today?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know. Is our voicemail back up yet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, they‚Äôre still working on that virus.</p>
<p>‚ÄìVirus, how can voicemail have a virus? Never mind, I‚Äôll call in later‚Ä¶ racing down the hallway for the brushed steel of the elevator door shutting against ‚ÄìWait‚Ä¶! an entreaty that was ignored then and there but perversely answered at the exit gate, where two gondolas of CREDNE Waste Management backed beeping across both lanes of the road, and at Mariposa, where under the blunt barrel of the traffic camera the light flicked from yellow to red at his approach, and again at the plinth welcoming car after waiting car to Circuit City Toys ‚Äú–Ø‚Äù Us Barnes &amp; Noble Starbucks, and by car after creeping car searching and pausing for the hope, seldom met though often indulged, of a parking space about to be vacated, a hope at last interrupted by the blare of a horn which, Quine realized in angry surprise, was his own.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry I‚Äôm late, I</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm used to it. Can you believe this line? stretching from the sidewalk through the doorway into halflight where, a few people ahead, at the threshold of dimness, a woman brushed a veil of auburn hair from the pale skin of her neck, revealing the volutions of her ear. Quine felt sweat spring from him. ‚ÄìListen, maybe this isn‚Äôt the</p>
<p>‚ÄìRelax, we‚Äôre moving, and the line surged forward, while a woman in red pushed to join the auburnhaired woman with just a glance at the people in line behind her.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome crowd, said Lynn as they entered the dimness. The boy behind the counter turned to the woman in red with an expression not quite a query, ‚ÄìMe? Oh no I‚Äôm not in line, I‚Äôm just talking to my friend, but as long as I‚Äôm here, what kind of herbal teas do you have? and as the boy indicated the menu board and the woman slowly took it in, ‚ÄìIs the hibiscus tea sweet? I mean, is it sweet hibiscus tea? and [pg315] the boy didn‚Äôt know and as the auburn head turned Quine turned to Lynn.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe we should‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you in a hurry?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo but I, and the woman in red carried on, ‚Äìwell then, how about a decaf mocha latt√®, is that with foamed milk? Can I get lowfat? And lowfat, is that one or two percent, and the boy didn‚Äôt know and turned to another boy while the woman in red resumed talking to her auburnhaired friend.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, really I don‚Äôt want anything, why don‚Äôt we</p>
<p>‚ÄìNeither do I, but as long as we‚Äôre here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but, and the boy answered one percent and the woman pulled from her conversation looked vaguely annoyed until, ‚Äìoh, all right then, and can I get just a dollop of whipped cream? while the steaming nozzle hissed and spat and the woman interrupted, ‚Äìoh, and can I get that in a mug? not a paper cup? and the boy dumped the contents of the cup and started over while the auburn head moved again.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome on, we‚Äôre up. Espresso please.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, capp, no, make that just some steamed milk please, nonfat milk‚Ä¶ as the auburn head began to turn and Quine turned away to study two chromed machines Gaggia and Rancilio in full steam drowning out further talk.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGrab that table if you can. I‚Äôll bring the drinks.</p>
<p>Across the room the woman with auburn hair and the woman in red joined a wiry man, white teeth in a tanned face, his blackhaired forearms resting on the table. He glanced over as Lynn set a cup before Quine and Quine looked down.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wanted to see up close who put my friends at Caf√© Desaparecidos out of business. This espresso is terrible. Have you seen this? She opened a folder and spread out papers Chivian-Harris, Boole &amp; Clay, Soil Engineer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere, where did you get‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrom UC through the California Public Records Act.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut how did you, Lynn tell me, did you see these in my briefcase? [pg316]</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn your briefcase? Do you think I‚Äôd‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay I‚Äôm sorry I just, I don‚Äôt know what to think‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt think you can trust me that far?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo I‚Äôm sorry, Lynn, I do trust you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, in your briefcase, so you do know about them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBran Nolan wanted me to look, I didn‚Äôt even have a chance‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo you know what they mean.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, i just said I haven‚Äôt had a</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen I‚Äôll tell you. This first report showed EPA action levels of metals and volatile organic compounds. The second report is a whitewash, which incidentally gave permission to start construction. Now this, this is a soil report, but the results are nonsense, the soil density meter was marked defective. But when the instrument was tested later, it worked fine. do you know how those meters work?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, how, how would I?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey measure how much radioactivity passes through a sample of the soil.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWith what, a neutron source?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know, I can find out. But if the meter was working, this means the soil was radioactive. And that soil went offsite.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, we don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs the problem. The nearest Credne job site is a residential community called Estancia Estates.</p>
<p>Quine turned to the table where the auburnhaired woman and the red dress and the dark forearms had left. Four teenagers sat there now. Lynn followed his stare.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is it? What are you looking at?</p>
<p>‚ÄìEstancia Estates? You‚Äôre sure?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, of course not, that‚Äôs just a guess based on it being nearby. the point is it could b</p>
<p>‚ÄìHave you tested the soil there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe tried to interest the Department of Health Services, but they won‚Äôt do it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell no wonder, you have no evidence‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, that soil is somewhere. Maybe in people‚Äôs yards.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you go to the developer? Make them test it. [pg317]</p>
<p>‚ÄìCatullus Development owns four thousand acres in this area. If we say a word about this they‚Äôll sue us.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSue you? What for?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tortious%20interference" title="Wikipedia: tortious interference">tortious interference</a> with economic advantage, for instance. There‚Äôs a dozen ways to craft a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAPP" title="Wikipedia: SLAPP">SLAPP</a> suit. A whisper of this could cost them millions in lost property value, they won‚Äôt sit still for that. The mayor and the council won‚Äôt sit still for it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSlap‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìStrategic lawsuit against public participation. For them it‚Äôs a cost of doing business, for us it‚Äôs disabling, the point is we don‚Äôt have a way to get this information out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìInformation? it‚Äôs not even a rumor‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you could, Philip. You could pressure Credne. All that work at the Lab is worth a lot to them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh Lynn‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, dual toxics reports, that‚Äôs not good. You‚Äôre covering someth</p>
<p>‚Äìare you threat</p>
<p>‚Äìa threat? Is that what you think this is?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, what am I suppo</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a chance to do the right thing! Tell Credne to test the soil! At Estancia, or wherever else it could have gone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you think they‚Äôll just, for God‚Äôs sake Lynn, they won‚Äôt like it any better coming from us!</p>
<p>‚ÄìTony said you wouldn‚Äôt do it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTony? Since when have you and Tony have been strategizing about me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, would it hurt to ask them?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, it would, it would damage a relationship that‚Äôs strained already.</p>
<p>‚Äìstrained how?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt need to know that.</p>
<p>She sat back. ‚ÄìAll right.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook‚Ä¶ will I, will I see you later?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course. At the hearing. She was putting the papers away.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but I mean‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs, where is it again? [pg318]</p>
<p>‚ÄìFirst Unitarian Church of Kentwood. Eight. I have to get going, because I need to talk to people before it starts. You know how to get there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I‚Ä¶ Kentwood‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>When she‚Äôd gone he looked up from the flyer she‚Äôd left to the table opposite, now empty. The sun, so bright and warm an hour before, was now a mere glow within sullen bands of cloud climbing the western sky, winter‚Äôs last obduracy. The paling blue overhead was specked with gray puffs sailing steadily east. A bright contrail arched above the sullen glow, scoring a straight line that wavered only at its end. In the vastness of the parking lot the sky‚Äôs radiance diminished and a wind came up. The clutter of œà Psychotherapy Associates, Zany Brainy, Taco Bell, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, nearly blocked out the green of the distant ridge where, halfway down and hardly visible in the frame of Blenzers and Leather For Le$$, grass and earth had been torn by the orange dots of trucks now idle there. A blare of horn and a flicker of headlamps just behind him brought his eyes up to the glare and moving mouth of a driver jabbing a finger at his space. His radio came to life with, ‚Äìinjury accident at Christopher, as he rounded the cloverleaf &lt;- Oakland Sacramento -&gt; where a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/travertine" title="Wikipedia: travertine">travertine</a> and glass building, touched by the sun‚Äôs last rays, ignited in a red glow as he came down the onramp joining a myriad of red and white lights in a stream heading west and east past Codorn c s XIT NLY to Kentwood RIGHT LANE as he searched the dashboard and the seat beside him for the flyer left behind in the caf√©, unreadable in the last glimmer of the darkling sky over a cul-de-sac among lighted homes. He turned his watch into the pool of a streetlight, 8:20, then circled back to the small sign he‚Äôd missed, First Unitarian, and lurched onto a rutted dirt road.</p>
<p>So many cars were parked in the lot that for a moment he lost his faith that this meeting was an irrelevancy, an ironic genuflection to a democracy that even the governed no longer took seriously. He scanned warily and in vain for a red Miata SFORZA, past pickups SUVs Volvos Hondas Acuras with their various blazons <img height="17" src="../images/2002-radiance/ichthys.png" title="Christian ŒôŒßŒòŒ•Œ£/ichthys symbol; adapted from http://creationwiki.org/pool/images/e/e0/Ichthys.png" width="51" /> ŒôŒßŒòŒ•Œ£, CARPENTERS UNION LOCAL 713, PLUMBERS STEAMFITTERS 342, SHEET METAL WORKERS 104, WWJD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%20Would%20Jesus%20Do" title="Wikipedia: What Would Jesus Do">What Would Jesus Do</a>, [pg319] ETERNITY Smoking Or Non-Smoking, JESUS DIED 4U, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSOL" title="Wikipedia: KSOL">98.9 SOL</a>, Got Crypto?

He walked back into the light from the entranceway and the spill of people there, voices laboring under the obligations of a world grown too complex to compass except by traversing from one likely story to the next, resting the weight of preconceptions upon them for only so long as each held. The crowd wedged him against a folding table bearing any number of available fictions in pamphlet form, The Challenge Of Stockpile Stewardship, What Would Gandhi Think?, Countering the Lies of the Lab, The Avalon Facility And The Issue Of Nonproliferation Preliminary Draft Study, which he opened to <em>On February 8 1994, Senator Samuel Chase requested that the secretary of Energy resolve the question of whether the Avalon facility will aid or hinder US nonproliferation efforts.</em></p>

<p>Through an open door BREAKOUT ROOM a dozen or so people sat wincing under the grate of an amplified voice.</p>
<p>‚Äìopportunity to, to give you sort of a overview to stockpile stewardship and a bit of an overview to the Avalon mission requirements. As my viewgraph indicates, I‚Äôm deputy assistant secretary for research, development, and simula</p>
<p>From the next door came a woman‚Äôs keen, a woman in a long white dress clasped at the waist, raven hair over her shoulders, a woman pacing, halting, declaiming, ‚ÄìWhen everything needed was brought into being, when everything needed was properly nourished, when heaven had moved away from earth and the name of man was fixed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki" title="Wikipedia: Enki">Enki</a> gave his daughter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna" title="Wikipedia: Inanna">Inanna</a> blessings, and she took them. He gave her truth, descent into the underworld, ascent from the underworld, the art of lovemaking, the art of forthright speech, the art of slanderous speech, the art of treachery, the plundering of cities, deceit, kindness, the kindling of strife, the making of decisions‚Ä¶ Quine pressed on toward PUBLIC HEARING -&gt; stopped by the crowd in the doorway, as within the room an electronic whine rose and died at a raised podium visible through a sea of heads.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to start out with making, making sure that everyone understands. The stockpile stewardship program is the policy of the nation. Its, its, roots derive from the presidential directive.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrom the great above she opened her ear to the great below. When she entered the first gate her crown was removed. Inanna asked, what is this? Quiet, Inanna. The ways of the underworld are perfect. They may not be questioned, as from near the podium he saw Lynn pushing her way to him with fury in her eyes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe secretary of energy reaffirmed the, the following reaffirmation by the President that it‚Äôs the policy of the nation to maintain its no-test policy. And the secretary is, has been very forefront in, in maintaining for that. It‚Äôs one of her most respon, most important responsibilities to ensure that the US nuclear stockpile remains safe, secure, and reliable without nuclear testing. The US nuclear deterrent remains a supreme national interest, and those are very special words in treaties, the supreme national interest clause. What we have to do is [pg321] while we‚Äôre going along, maintain the institutional viability to respond to all parts of the, of the stockpile mission, including reconstitution if we, if we are asked by the President.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen she entered the seventh gate from her body the royal robe was removed. She was naked. Inanna asked, What is this? Quiet, Inanna. No one ascends from the underworld unmarked, said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ereshkigal" title="Wikipedia: Ereshkigal">Ereshkigal</a>. If Inanna wishes to ascend she must send someone in her place. Take him! cried Inanna, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallu" title="Wikipedia: Gallu">galla</a> seized her husband <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammuz%20%28deity%29" title="Wikipedia: Tammuz (deity)">Dumuzi</a>, as she grasped Quine‚Äôs arm and drew him inside the doorway. She led him to the far wall and edged them along it to the front of the room.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is a very comprehensive facility. It serves a very wide spectrum of, of user communities, all the way from very specific bomb designers, to some of the look, looking at some of the things you can read about in the newspaper about our, our astronomy discoveries. This is a needed flagship high-energy density facility for stockpile stewardship. We, we need ignition and nuclear burn. We need implosion and radiation physics from this facility. It‚Äôs a magnet for world class talent. It provides key validations of computer simulation. Ignition in particular is one that I am particularly focused on because it is a clear dividing line. This is going to be a very, very large validation element for validation. Sine qua non. I mean, this is essential, basic and applied science exploration. And we have to have that. This is where we are, we are seeking to reach the temperatures of the stars, and, and also the same similar to the temperature at the inside of a nuclear device as, as it goes off.</p>

<p>Lynn‚Äôs whisper was fierce. ‚ÄìThere‚Äôs about a hundred people here from the construction trades. They‚Äôre all signed up to speak, it‚Äôs going to take all night. Did you call the unions, put them up to this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo of course not I, glancing over to where Szabo stood like a post. [pg322]</p>
<p>‚Äìcontinue now, our next commentor</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm tempted to blow your cover, make you get up there and explain a few things.</p>
<p>‚Äìhundreds of jobs</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease Lynn, I‚Äôm, I came, didn‚Äôt I.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGod they‚Äôre eating into our time and they‚Äôre saying the same thing over and</p>
<p>‚Äìjobs over the next five years adding a hundred million dollars to the local econ</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat is so untrue, she muttered and as yet another man stood to take the wireless microphone passed to him, she waved her hand and called out ‚ÄìExcuse me! Excuse me, I don‚Äôt want to cut anyone off, but are we going to hear the exact same thing from another fifty electricians?</p>
<p>From next to them a voice growled, ‚ÄìHey girly, wait your turn and don‚Äôt disrespect the trades.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have the greatest respect for the construction trades, but a lot of other people are waiting to speak. Could we summarize please? and a stir behind the podium as ‚ÄìI think in light of the advancing hour‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìGot em, she muttered, and without a look back at Quine began to make her way across the room.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine, hello, I saw you in the audience, wasn‚Äôt sure if I should introduce you or not.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, I‚Äôm just, just stopped in to see how, how things were going, I‚Äôm about ready to</p>
<p>‚ÄìI saw you talking to that rather well informed young lady.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUnder the pretense of maintaining the safety and reliability of the stockpile, stewardship is intended to preserve the capacity to maintain, test, modify, design and produce nuclear weapons, with or without underground testing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat is not the department‚Äôs stated position. We are committed</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh yes she‚Äôs, that is, we‚Äôre acquainted of course, her group is a, a kind of, kind of a watchdog group, we hear, hear from them a lot, kind of a, our, ah, keep us honest‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre, ah, I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìCarl <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/schlecht" title="German; 'bad'">Schlecht</a>. We met in DC, just after the New Year. But I‚Äôm sure you met dozens of people on that trip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure, yes, of course, I ah, good to [pg323]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI work with Reese in DP. We‚Äôre on tour here, kind of a sideshow really, but the chairman of Appropriations put pressure on the secretary. We‚Äôve got ten of these things scheduled this month, from here we go to Amarillo, Santa Fe, South Carol</p>
<p>‚Äìdocuments posted on DOE‚Äôs own Defense Programs server state that the US will continue to introduce new weapons, as per the B sixty one rev eleven</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust a, just a moment, what documents?</p>
<p>‚ÄìCore R and AT Program Elements from the DOE Office of Research and Inertial Fusion, in the section headed Concept Design and</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust a‚Ä¶ The two DOE representatives huddled out of microphone range.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo you‚Äôre not going to be speaking tonight, Doctor Quine?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, no, I mean I</p>
<p>‚Äìdocuments have since been removed from the site, an action that we regard as highly suspicio</p>
<p>‚ÄìI must say, Doctor Quine, this young lady has excellent sources.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, we‚Äôre aware of those, of those, those documents, and, and they were removed from the site because they shouldn‚Äôt have been there to start with. The</p>
<p>‚ÄìOnce you make something public you can‚Äôt just withdraw it because it‚Äôs embarrassing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose documents were outdated and had been superseded.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs no date on the document.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Quine‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe online version may not, not be dated, that‚Äôs an oversight, but the document itself is from nineteen ninety two.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? No, no I won‚Äôt be speaking.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut the language and the programs listed are virtually identical to your F Y ninety five. These are clearly statements of intent to design new weapons.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe US policy is to develop no new nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you willing to stand here and say that there is no consideration in the labs, that no scientists are thinking about pure fusion weapons?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere is no pure fusion weapons program at any Department facility. [pg324]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat wasn‚Äôt my question.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe never tell scientists to stop thinking, but there is no program.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen what are your scientists thinking about? Can you be more specific?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs to specifics, we‚Äôre not at liberty to discuss them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about the B sixty one rev eleven? Isn‚Äôt that a new weapon?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe physics package of the B sixty one has not been changed, therefore it is not a new weapon.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe modification gives the weapon entirely new strategic uses. Is it US policy to upgrade existing weapons into what are, essentially, new applications?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe will replace or rebuild existing designs as needed but we won‚Äôt be adding new marks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust about any nation looking at this is going to consider it a new weapon. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your stated policy is if your actions contradict it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThank you. I think five minutes is, is our limit, if we can move to the next commentor, ah</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnyway Doctor Quine I just wanted to tell you how grateful we were for the, the heads, oh hello Miss, Miss Hamlin is it? I was just saying how impressed I was with your presentation.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt feel I made much of an impression.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, I think you may underestimate, ah, just how seriously the department takes ah your group. Anyway, what was I</p>
<p>‚Äìlast ten years the number of chronically hungry children grew from</p>

<p>‚ÄìOh you know Reese, Miss ah Hamlin?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôve had dealings.</p>
<p>‚Äìmoney could be better spent on schools, hospitals, housing</p>
<p>‚Äìthink the, the commentor might be confusing the Department of Energy with the Department of Health and Human Services</p>
<p>‚ÄìI really should get back up there, nice seeing you again, Doctor [pg325] Quine. You too Miss ah‚Ä¶ as Schlecht‚Äôs extended hand fell back unmet by the hard resolve in Lynn‚Äôs eyes that turned to Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, give my, my best to, to, to Reese‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìReese Turbot. At DP.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you happen to mention this ORIF document to him? Because boy did it disappear fast, like the day after I showed it to you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUS is legally committed to disarmament as a signer of the non-proliferation trea</p>

<p>‚ÄìDo you mean that I need to?</p>
<p>She didn‚Äôt answer, but stared grimly as a slender bearded man in caftan and sandals stood to declaim pacifist couplets punctuated by arabesques on a flute while murmurs and snickers ran through the audience. When he‚Äôd finished she muttered, ‚ÄìFriends like these. As Quine turned to her he confronted a tanned face with a well managed smile, and a wiry tanned hand resting on her shoulder.</p>

<p>‚Äìreally can‚Äôt take any more of this, can you please, can we go now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGo? I thought you understood that I was here for the evening.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt know it was going to be the whole time.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI, Gopal! Hello yes, you‚Äôve seen Tony‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>The lot was half empty. Under the full moon his car glowed white. He lurched onto the rutted road and drove past the freeway and up Crow Canyon Road. As he ascended a mist gathered in the headlights. A fear in his heart, that he‚Äôd be judged. That he wouldn‚Äôt be. Soon he was at a closed gate. PARK HOURS 6AM-8PM. A building was set back among the trees. In the second story window a dim line flickered, a fluorescent tube neither on nor off, stuttering between states. A broad path rose winding under black oak and bay. A deer came into the beam, the moist dark of its eyes on him, ears athwart, antlers forked like lightning. It raised one hoof as if inviting chase, then with no sense of hurry bounded into a thicket. Nothing more stirred but the mist, droplets brightening and thickening there, then vanishing into the dark.</p>
<hr />
<p>The morning was clear. Eucalyptus blossomed and a new warmth urged out its pungency. In among the sickles of leathery green leaves were white blooms, each made up of thousands of twined filaments. In a breeze they drifted down like a sunshower. Just outside the kitchen window a live oak leaf spun like a coin, suspended in air by spidersilk that vanished and reappeared as it spun.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWill you drive?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure, I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour CD player‚Äôs jammed. She reached for, ‚ÄìNo don‚Äôt touch, the sudden growl of ‚Äìwho are you this time? under his ‚ÄìDamn it! I had that all‚Ä¶ as he fidgeted the buttons for silence returning with the blue blink of JAM.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%20Waits" title="Wikipedia: Tom Waits">Tom Waits</a>?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it‚Äôs, the stereo is broken, the eject button doesn‚Äôt work and the last owner just left this disk stuck in here so I had to, to figure out how to, to, what‚Äôs so funny?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHere I thought I was seeing a new side of you, and it‚Äôs just some technical problem you haven‚Äôt fixed yet. [pg328]</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes well the dealer, it‚Äôs not a factory install so, so‚Ä¶ well I‚Äôm glad you think it‚Äôs funny, his hand pulling back from the buttons when she stopped it with hers and held it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo you‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre annoyed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, believe it or not, I like you as you are. When you let yourself be.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, but it is annoying, I actually can‚Äôt turn it off, just to play the radio I have to, to, and as he held ^ to demonstrate the blue segments of the display flashed JAM before the radio boomed, ‚Äìa fewer percentage of</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease turn it off.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan‚Äôt even do that, have to, what‚Äôs so, so damn funny? as he pressed SRC to silence the voice and JAM flashed again.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm in a good mood. It‚Äôs a beautiful day, Mandela is president of South Africa, and I‚Äôm still working for CANT.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTony‚Äôs keeping you on? You should get it in writing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGopal convinced him that I know what I‚Äôm doing. Slow down, this is it.</p>
<p>Off the road a gate EBMUD No Trespassing Day Use Permits opened on an unpaved circle. He parked in dust and gravel.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh pooh. I‚Äôm not driving to Lafayette for a damn day use permit.</p>
<p>An edge of the coming summer heat lay half hidden in the sun-roasted smell of sage. Hills still green were specked with the yellow blossoms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch%20broom" title="Wikipedia: Scotch broom">Scotch broom</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard%20plant" title="Wikipedia: Mustard plant">mustard</a> and the pale blue spires of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupinus" title="Wikipedia: Lupinus">lupines</a>. Sky spilled over water held back by an earthen berm. On the dirt road over the berm was a vacant aluminum trailer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills%20College" title="Wikipedia: Mills College">Mills College</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing%20%28sport%29" title="Wikipedia: Rowing (sport)">Crew</a>. Redwinged blackbirds darted in metallic song. The trail climbed through oak and bay. Even in the treesoftened sunlight he sweated. She waited on a clear rise above the reservoir. The sky was so empty there he dizzied almost. On a day this warm and clear last summer he‚Äôd touched her for the first time. They‚Äôd watched a redtailed hawk bank and soar. Her dark eyes squinted, her lips parted in what was less a smile than delight arrested and contained at the moment it was born. Her head was tilted and sunlight moved glittering through her [pg329] cropped black hair to the base of her neck. A muscle stood out where her jaw met her ear. His hand went out to touch the down of her neck and her head tipped back into it. The warmth of her hair and the weight of her head filled his hand.</p>
<p>Now a bird flock was scattered on the sky, white flashes that vanished into blue, reappeared black, vanished again wheeling, flickering it seemed in and out of existence. The glitter of light on water also moved in and out of being. He was on the verge of something, as if God, as extravagant with bounty as he was stingy with meaning, might have hidden the clues to being somewhere in being‚Äôs very abundance and superfluity.</p>
<p>Lynn‚Äôs warm hand slipped into his. Startled, his thoughts fled. ‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry about last night. It was crunch time for me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs all right. I was, just wasn‚Äôt feeling all that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìTurner was good. I wish you‚Äôd stayed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow about here? Quine moved into the shadow of a bay tree.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook out! Poison oak. Rhus diversiloba.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSacred to‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>She smiled. ‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a New World plant, Western states only. Coyote, I guess. It‚Äôs probably sacred to Coyote.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCoyote‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTrickster. It‚Äôs a tricky plant. Even the genus name was changed, from Rhus to Toxicodendron. Its leaves can be dark green or bright red. Even the bare branches and the roots are toxic. Tricky plant.</p>
<p>She unpacked small plastic tubs of lentils and chevre, fennel and red onion, olives, pears, a baguette. Acorn and leaf trash littered the hard dry ground. They sat in silence as he stared across the glittering water.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was, I don‚Äôt know, I was thinking about light. About energy. I just, I had an idea about something. There‚Äôs this effect that happens in, in plasmas‚Ä¶ do, do you know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%20scattering" title="Wikipedia: Rayleigh scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a>?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, tell me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe sky‚Äôs blue because of it. Sunlight is scattered by air molecules, and the short wavelengths like blue scatter most so that‚Äôs what we see the blue. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Strutt%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Rayleigh" title="Wikipedia: John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a> discovered the effect, actually he discovered much more, an amazing scientist, all the work he did [pg330] in the nineteenth century on fluid dynamics, wave equations, we‚Äôre still, I mean well, anyway‚Ä¶ and, and you see near the horizon, how the blue shades into white? That‚Äôs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie%20scattering" title="Wikipedia: Mie scattering">Mie scattering</a>, light bouncing off larger particles, larger than a wavelength, so the light remains white but most of it comes forward, but see, these are both forms of elastic scattering, they don‚Äôt actually change the wavelength of the light. But in plasmas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman%20scattering" title="Wikipedia: Raman scattering">Raman scattering</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brillouin%20scattering" title="Wikipedia: Brillouin scattering">Brillouin scattering</a> are inelastic, the photons gain or lose energy, they actually shift their frequency, so it becomes an issue in, especially in laser-plasma interactions. anyway I was just thinking that at certain energies you might get another kind of, of sort of a resonance effect that might‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine scattering.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt joke, I‚Äôm just</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut no, why not? Why couldn‚Äôt you discover an effect?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut that‚Äôs, no I mean, it‚Äôs only an engineering problem. It‚Äôs still physics I guess, but not, not‚Ä¶ A sudden desolation welled up in him, from that nowhere he couldn‚Äôt name or manage, the warmth and the scent of the day receding even as they came forward to overwhelm him, turned against themselves in mockery of his anxiety, some unnameable burden that had just caught up with him sitting there in his vortex of vanished peace.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot‚Ä¶ not what I ever meant to do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou sound so resigned.</p>
<p>An annoyance came over him, but passed off into the depth of that nowhere. ‚ÄìIf I‚Äôd had it in me to do, don‚Äôt you think I would have? That paper with Sorokin, maybe that was all I had.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh Philip. If you feel this way why did you take the director‚Äôs job?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt was a last chance for me. I just couldn‚Äôt believe it when I was offered this‚Ä¶ but I was a terrible choice, don‚Äôt you think I, everyone in the Lab knows it, I know Szabo wants to get rid of me, but maybe R√©ti‚Äôs right, this is what science is now. Maybe my role is to enable others.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut to enable them to what? Walk your path, from science to weapons? [pg331] She took his hand. ‚ÄìYou remember last summer? Right here. We kissed for the first time. Nothing seemed impossible then.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd now we‚Äôre so much closer!</p>
<p>‚ÄìCloser‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTo each other. To what we want. You don‚Äôt have to go on with the bad choices of the past‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut that‚Äôs just it, I‚Äôm surrounded by all these bad choices, bad ideas, relics of some past, there are whole groups, departments, sections devoted to them, we have contracts and deliverables, it‚Äôs like a maze you have to run, there‚Äôs no time to, to reflect on what direction you should take just get to the next corner and go on from there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I know. Sometimes I think it‚Äôs impossible. That you can‚Äôt convert these entrenched ideas. That nothing good can ever come of them. That we‚Äôd have to close down all the weapons labs. And even then it wouldn‚Äôt end. It does seem impossible sometimes. But</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I mean, how do you keep on with it when you see how impossible it is?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt live with myself if I don‚Äôt try.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI just, sometimes I just want to give up. But if you think it‚Äôs all so compromised, what about me? Why are you with me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause I trust you, Philip. That you want to do the right thing. And it‚Äôs so hard for you. Do you trust me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTrust? as something fled across his face looking for a place to hide, and was trapped there. ‚ÄìYes I, of course I, I mean‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause that‚Äôs all there is finally, that fragile skein of trust. Without it everything falls apart.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Her dark eyes engaged his. ‚ÄìAnd with it, you know, it‚Äôs not hopeless. We do have a chance. With Turner‚Äôs comment, the other comments from the hearing, we can convince DOE, to halt Avalon or scale it back. The Lab could</p>
<p>‚ÄìTo halt‚Ä¶? Oh but‚Ä¶ something like alarm rose in him. ‚ÄìBut you know it already went in. The Conceptual Design Report. The secretary okayed it. The baseline budget was accepted, I mean it won‚Äôt be formally approved for a few months, but, but even Chase signed off. It [pg332] looks like a sure thing, even the x-ray laser, we‚Ä¶ Lynn? She was on her feet, standing against that flawless sky, fighting it seemed for breath.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat? When did this. Did you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow long have you known?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt just I just</p>
<p>‚ÄìEven, going into that meeting last night, you knew? And all my. You. You‚Äôd think. By now you‚Äôd think that I.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn‚Ä¶ he scrambled up to follow her pacing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean that everything we‚Äôve talked about, Chase, Turner, Sorokin, the public hearing, you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs all wasted because this decision was, was made. Like Tony said, it was a done deal. And I believed that you really wanted to to to</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, I did want, I do‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll my experience with politicians and I wasn‚Äôt ready for this. Damn!</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut‚Ä¶ he reached for her.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt you understand, my own foolishness that‚Äôs bad enough but how I‚Äôve behaved, used up favors, credibility, thrown CANT‚Äôs resources into this, because damn it I trusted you, thought you were being honest that there was a, a chance to turn it around‚Ä¶ and now this, this makes me feel so stupid!</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, please, isn‚Äôt there more between us than‚Ä¶ stepping up to where she whirled in dappled sun to push him away, ‚ÄìDon‚Äôt! as his heel turned on a loose stone, gave under him, and toppled him into the brush. Under his hand and against his face were the waxy green leaves and white berries of Rhus or Toxicodendron.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh God. Wait, let me, she bent to unscrew the cap from a water bottle as he thrashed upward. ‚ÄìDon‚Äôt touch me! I mean, wait, just lie there while I‚Ä¶ as she wet a kerchief he gazed at the burning sky. She dabbed at his face.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShut your eyes. This is to get the plant oil off, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urushiol" title="Wikipedia: urushiol">urushiol</a>. Your skin oil will protect you for an hour or two. When you get home, take a cool shower. Don‚Äôt use soap or hot water, they‚Äôll break down your skin oil before the urushiol. [pg333]</p>
<p>‚ÄìAren‚Äôt you coming home with me?</p>
<p>She dabbed in silence at his hands and forearms. She folded the kerchief and poured water from the bottle over her hands one at a time, then threw kerchief and bottle into her pack.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll see you at the car.</p>
<p>She turned from him and went steadily into the sun, where, ruffled by a wind, her hair spread out in fiery points. The sunlight was so bright now it was hollow, the reality leached from everything. It was a few minutes before he followed. She was waiting near the gate, across the circle from the car, and came toward it only when he unlocked the doors.</p>
<p>They drove in silence down the winding white road to the freeway.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou weren‚Äôt such a bad choice. The x-ray laser, that‚Äôs the real kicker, that you hated so much, now you‚Äôre protecting it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn it‚Äôs not the, the Superbright it‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe if you solve your Quine scattering problem all those undead Reagan assholes can bring their missile defense back to life.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs not what</p>
<p>‚ÄìGod I‚Äôm so mad at you! We‚Äôre keeping our bombs no matter what so fuck you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn, I said, you know, if you wanted to have an impact you should, you could have come on board with us, you say you‚Äôre trying to go to law school but</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, don‚Äôt say anything more.</p>
<p>At a red light he looked away from the barrel of the traffic camera to FAST DIVORCE BANKRUPTCY on a bus stop bench.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn please, I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶ will you let me‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìCANT‚Äôs sending me back to Geneva. For the second CTBT session. It starts May sixteenth. I‚Äôll be gone six weeks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou didn‚Äôt tell me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was waiting for you to ask.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I didn‚Äôt know, how could I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìTo ask about, I don‚Äôt know, about anything that‚Äôs important to me.</p>
<p>He reached for her and she backed away. ‚ÄìI really don‚Äôt want poison [pg334] oak.</p>
<p>After she‚Äôd gone inside he watched a cloud of insects move in and out of sun. At home in the shower he turned the water as hot as possible. He stood laving and scrubbing until his skin was red.</p>

<p>[pg335] ‚Äìten minutes we‚Äôll bring you the world, which suddenly loomed closer in the form of HOW AM I DRIVING? CALL 1-800-328-7448 as he braked and ‚ÄìNorth Korea said it‚Äôs started withdrawing spent fuel from a nucular reactor without international inspectors present, an action that senior US officials warned, pressing ^ for the blue blink of JAM where a red Miata SFORZA was parked between a Mercedes and a dumpster CREDNE Waste Management. As he released the seat belt he caught a glimpse of himself in the rearview mirror, the left half of a face distended in forsakenness and misery, and swollen with welts now crusting and beginning to weep clear fluid. He dabbed with a handkerchief already stiff and yellowed, holding it there through Soon Yet OPEN Visa Mastercard PUSH, from blinding heat into bone chill, a crowded foyer, and up to an impassive Chinese, ‚ÄìExcuse me, is Leo Highet, who pointed to a table behind a potted ficus.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry I‚Äôm late, the traff</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat happened to your face?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPoison oak.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cortisone" title="Wikipedia: cortisone">cortisone</a> shot? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benadryl" title="Wikipedia: Benadryl">Benadryl</a>‚Äôs good.

Try the jellied duck feet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not hungry.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSuit yourself. Highet speared a dumpling and brought it to his mouth. ‚ÄìHow‚Äôs your girlfriend? Still speaking truth to power? Is [pg336] power listening yet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, I didn‚Äôt come for</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôll have two of these and two of these. Keep your strength up, it‚Äôs a stressful job.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is it you want?</p>
<p>‚ÄìRight to business, wow. Somehow I thought we‚Äôd start out comparing notes. How to get the washroom sink to drain. Keeping Dolores‚Äôs radio down. Figured everything out yet? Seems to me I had to file an environmental imapct statement just to eat lunch.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe new secretary of energy‚Äôs changing that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh right, Little Miss Openness. How‚Äôs that working out for you? You find that the Lab‚Äôs becoming a ‚Äúsafe and rewarding workplace that‚Äôs results-oriented and fun‚Äù?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, I don‚Äôt have time, what about Gate?</p>
<p>Highet pried opened a dumpling with his chopsticks and examined its interior. ‚ÄìHe‚Äôs working with North Koreans.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve been all through this with your friend Dan Root.</p>
<p>Highet looked up. ‚ÄìDan‚Äôs not a friend. We worked together once.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I need to know just what</p>
<p>‚ÄìI won‚Äôt forget your needs, but there‚Äôs something more pressing. Eight thousand fuel rods sitting in a cooling pond near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongbyon%20Nuclear%20Scientific%20Research%20Center" title="Wikipedia: Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center">Yongbyon</a>. That‚Äôs five bombs‚Äô worth of plutonium without even violating the NPT. If they‚Äôve been pulling spent fuel since the reactor started up in eighty six they could have built five or six bombs in the fifty kiloton range. They‚Äôre on their way to a nice little arsenal.<a href="#fn151" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> All they need is a delivery system. The CIA thinks they‚Äôre fifteen years from an ICBM, but the CIA can‚Äôt find its ass with both hands. Anyway they don‚Äôt want an ICBM. They want satellites. With another stage, their No Dong could put things in orbit.<a href="#fn152" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy are you so concerned about this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs what I do now. I‚Äôm a nonproliferation researcher at NOUS.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean, what, you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe advise NRO, CIA, DoD, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood God.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not as glamorous as it sounds.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGlamorous, it doesn‚Äôt sound, just, if you‚Äôre bringing the same, [pg337] the same level of truth you did to Radiance to this job, it sounds dangerous is what it sounds.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWorld‚Äôs a dangerous place. But I‚Äôm wasting your valuable time with all this history. All I want to know‚Äôs if the Supreme Leader‚Äôs getting flight data from Persephone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI held up the CRADA. Root said he‚Äôd go to NASA to get the data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, I know who to call there. My guess is they‚Äôre getting the data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is absurd, Gate told me his Korean partner is Hyundai, but even if, so what, what if they are getting some data?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHyundai, that‚Äôs cute. Suppose it‚Äôs true. How will Pyongyang react when they hear that their neighbor to the south is checking out a missile defense component? Look, this data is the camel‚Äôs nose. If Gate‚Äôs CRADA goes through, the whole package is out there, thrusters, sensors, everything. The North Koreans are very resourceful. Our intel keeps saying they‚Äôre on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%20Korean%20famine" title="Wikipedia: North Korean famine">the verge of economic collapse</a>, yet somehow they hang on. Somehow they‚Äôve built nuclear reactors, missiles, sure they had Russian and Chinese help but not lately, and they were always smart enough to play the two off against each other. You‚Äôve got to admire the feisty little fucks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you‚Äôre worried that they may launch a few satellites?</p>
<p>‚ÄìRight, who cares about some piece of junk playing The Immortal Hymn Of Bum Suk Kim on the ten meter band until its batteries run down. But have you looked closely at the Slingshot technology?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre no longer doing missile defense.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI see why Chase likes you so much. Do you know what Persephone is carrying?</p>
<p>‚ÄîSensors, we designed the sensors‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìRight, you‚Äôre an executive summary kind of guy. The Slingshot is a kinetic kill vehicle that</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know all</p>
<p>‚Äìthat can carry a payload of up to a hundred kilos. That‚Äôs either a dieting engineer or a small nuke. You want five, ten, fifty of those things in low earth orbit?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat makes you think</p>
<p>‚Äì‚ÄúStates parties to the treaty undertake not to place in orbit [pg337] around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons.‚Äù Outer Space Treaty, nineteen sixty seven. North Korea never signed.<a href="#fn153" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, so what, they‚Äôre a, a rogue state, you were always so contemptuous of treaties‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you notice that they announced their intent to withdraw from the NPT? They take those commitments seriously. They have a sense of honor. The US has fucked them and helped Japan fuck them for fifty years. Now President Bubba is yelling about sanctions over these fuel rods. How do you think they‚Äôll take that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, even if they get the Slingshot, even if they can launch those things, even if they do have bombs</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%20Command" title="Wikipedia: Space Command">Space Command</a> can track an object the size of a softball, but how do you prove there are nukes on board? Are we going to start shooting down satellites on suspicion? And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite%20weapon%23U.S.%20programs" title="Wikipedia: Anti-satellite weapon#U.S. programs">with what</a>?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo this is your way to, to hit a bullet with a bullet, a Slingshot with another Slingshot, to keep that whole program alive? You‚Äôre going to claim we need to deploy these things before anybody else does.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMe? I just provide information. For example, a nuke dropped from an orbiting platform takes under five minutes to hit the ground. Or, you can set it off in low orbit and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear%20electromagnetic%20pulse" title="Wikipedia: Nuclear electromagnetic pulse">EM pulse</a> will take out military C3, computers, telephones, broadcasting, banking, toasters, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game%20Boy" title="Wikipedia: Game Boy">gameboys</a>, you name it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo you sell this fear, this, this farfetched story, beginning middle end, you‚Äôre still doing that, telling a story instead of, of the truth.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, Philip, truth is a story. Or do you know better than that? Help me out here. What‚Äôs the truth of your situation?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve got some some some‚Ä¶ after you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAfter I what? Tried to keep my Lab going in the face of impossible demands, incoherent policy, and ignorant policy makers? You getting a taste of that now? Ever had to explain anything to a congressman?</p>
<p>‚ÄìChase‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThink Chase is your friend, the very first time you forget to say mother may I he‚Äôll be on you like a wolverine. No, believe it or not I‚Äôm here to help you Philip. So don‚Äôt insult me. Don‚Äôt make yourself out to [pg339] be the victim, sitting in that chair you pulled out from under me. Pissing me off will only make me irrational and vindictive. Didn‚Äôt you have something to ask me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho‚Äôs Devon Null?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTalented physicist. I think he‚Äôs on Wall Street now. Using chaos theory to model financial trends.</p>
<p>‚ÄìRecords show he was never an employee.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt say.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo giving him an office was a little unusual, wasn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìEverybody has to be somewhere.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt was my office. He was never there. Nullpoint, what is that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have no idea.</p>
<p>‚ÄìConor recovered the deleted partition on your computer.</p>
<p>Highet set down his chopsticks and touched a napkin to his mouth. He chewed in silence for a moment, then looked around the room, as if someone out there might be easier to talk to. ‚ÄìWhat a great kid. Isn‚Äôt he a great kid? Okay, about Nullpoint. You‚Äôve probably never read your contract, but ass an employee of the University of California, you agreed to certain things. ‚ÄúIn the even that any such invention shall be deemed by University to be patentable, I shall do all things necessary to assign to University all rights, title and interest therein.‚Äù See, people at the Lab commit to an unusual scientific career. They do classified research that can‚Äôt be published. They invent things they can‚Äôt patent or sell. Occasionally the Lab waives commercial rights, but it‚Äôs always a pain in the ass, especially now that the university‚Äôs gotten so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh-Dole%20Act" title="Wikipedia: Bayh-Dole Act">greedy about patents</a>. So we set up a shell company. To shelter intellectual property.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs, it‚Äôs all about the money for you, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs it all about for you, Philip? Being right? I could care less about the money. I did this for my people. If they feel they‚Äôre getting ripped off they‚Äôll rip you off.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat would explain the forty million in missing inventory. How many people have profited from this setup?</p>
<p>‚ÄìProfited. Maybe once in a great while somebody got enough to pay off a loan. Profit? That‚Äôs change that fell out on the car seat. Christ Philip you bought a house with the rise in your salary, you know [pg340] what‚Äôs being tossed around. You want to talk real money, ask Dan Root. He‚Äôs the one with irons in the fire. I‚Äôm just a semi-retired consultant with condo payments to make and white papers to write. Or ask Rector, he‚Äôs already looked into this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo everybody thinks they‚Äôre entitled, is that right? Employees running insider land deals, walking out the door with equipment, taking kickbacks from patent agreements, you think that‚Äôs, that‚Äôs, there‚Äôs a GAO report on my desk about twelve thousand missing documents, nuclear weapons designs, x-ray laser plans, photos of tests, did any of those documents pass through Nullpoint?</p>
<p>Highet shook his head again and lowered it, as if tired of contending with missed points, to push the remains of a dumpling through a dark sauce on his plate. Quine put the coyote fetish on the table.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe thing about passwords, you should use a random string, never a real word. Seven characters minimum. Put some numbers and punctuation marks in it. And never write it down. But does anyone follow these simple rules? Highet put aside his chopsticks, then picked up the fetish and put it in his jacket pocket, ‚ÄìYou have any other questions for me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou worked on fusion for quite a while.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd many before me. Szabo‚Ä¶ R√©ti‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou wrote that a thousand joules was sufficient for ignition.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLong ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour computer model was optimistic.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt looked good at the time. Why are we talking about twenty year old computer codes?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOur codes still use many of the same assumptions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhen you simulate a complex process on a computer, you always make assumptions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou piggybacked fusion capsules onto Superbright tests, didn‚Äôt you. [pg341]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe did that all through the eighties.<a href="#fn154" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> More buck for the bang, you know?</p>

<p>‚ÄìRight, your shot. You‚Äôre upset we didn‚Äôt tell you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose shots were to verify your codes?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose shots were a proof of principle. The basis for Avalon. You want Avalon, I wouldn‚Äôt look too closely at that test data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy not?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know how demanding you are. It might not meet your high standards. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt have promised ignition.<a href="#fn155" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> I would have emphasized the weapons aspects. But I know you‚Äôre down on bombs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, we‚Äôve got Avalon. That‚Äôs for sure.</p>

<p>‚ÄìSzabo.</p>

<p>‚ÄìWhy do you care what</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat happens to you? I don‚Äôt. I care about the Lab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure, you care so much you rigged those codes back in the seventies to show just what you wanted, to get the funding, so now the entire laser program is based on a deception, that‚Äôs how much you care.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou really despise me, don‚Äôt you, Philip. You think I stole secrets, you think I faked data, why don‚Äôt you call the fucking FBI if you‚Äôre so sure. If you‚Äôve read my laser fusion papers you know the science is good. Despite how you feel about me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou were always after the money.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou amaze me. Only someone who doesn‚Äôt know what the fuck he‚Äôs talking about could be so sure. You know Bill Venham? No? Close friend of Dan Root. Ran direct mail for Goldwater. Claims he got Reagan elected governor in sixty six<a href="#fn157" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a>. Now he runs the Arete Foundation, heard of them? No? They own NOUS. They own broadcasters. They fund right wing causes. That loudmouth Eubanks on the radio? Venham [pg341] started him out eight years ago on a Sacramento station. They want to shut down DOE, give all the nuclear weapons work to the Pentagon, you think DOE‚Äôs fucked up talk to some ambitious Air Force colonel‚Äôs read too much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%20Clancy" title="Wikipedia: Tom Clancy">Tom Clancy</a>. Bill wants creationism taught in the schools, he‚Äôs got Senator Bangerter on board for that one. Oh, and Bill sponsors the Hertz fellowships. You‚Äôve heard of those. At least I know where my money comes from.</p>
<p>Highet pushed back his chair. ‚ÄìIf you‚Äôve had the time to crack my PGP, you must have found those GIF files on my disk. Not my thing, but I wondered why the hell they were on an open server, so I saved copies. Ask Conor about steganography. You‚Äôre so clever, you‚Äôll work it out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs all?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, I think so. Tell me Philip, you ever get any joy out of life?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJoy‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>Highet regarded him with the dour look of a man who‚Äôs missed a long-awaited chance. He dropped a few bills on the table. ‚ÄìThis is my treat.</p>
<p>The red Miata was gone when Quine emerged under a sky full of Mie scattering, a haze that magnified the sunlight by diffusing it into almost an opacity settled over the bridge as an unyielding glare while the battering of crosswinds tore free the fluttering Profit From Your Knowledge from under his wiper blade, and an orotund voice proposed that someone or something ‚Äìwouldn‚Äôt stand a prayer, before being silenced by a quick thumb jabbing 5 for the temporary solitude of brushed steel doors and ‚ÄìThe hell‚Ä¶? a breastwork of boxes stacked in the front office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe Conceptual Design Report is back from the printers. They sent ten copies.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood God I can‚Äôt get by them, how did</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs twenty seven volumes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell can‚Äôt we‚Ä¶ ow! What‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the new GAO report. Twenty copies I think? Jeremy Rector called, he‚Äôll be by to discuss it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDolores, I can‚Äôt work with this stuff here, can‚Äôt we move it to the library or something? [pg343]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey have copies already. Oh you have a call from Armand Steradian he wants to ask about Bernd Dietz.</p>
<p>‚Äì‚Ä¶yes I‚Äôll, listen Dolores can you get me Frank Szabo‚Äôs academic transcript from, from Yale I think‚Ä¶ jamming the inner door against a stack of boxes that tottered but stabilized as Conor, face crimsoned, came up from his chair, ‚ÄìJefe!

<p>‚ÄìPoison oak, as he pushed around to where splayed limb and pouting lips held out a promise of, if not fulfillment, at least distraction.</p>

<p>‚ÄìCould we please get rid of‚Ä¶ he leaned in to close the windows open on that plain of venery.</p>
<p>‚Äìactually Highet thought of it back when they found this stuff, you know, that it might be steganography?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat?</p>
<p>‚ÄìData hiding? Goes back like centuries. There‚Äôs a fifteenth century manuscript, the Steganographia by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes%20Trithemius" title="Wikipedia: Johannes Trithemius">Johannes Trithemius</a>, about the science of knowledge, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/art%20of%20memory" title="Wikipedia: art of memory">art of memory</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enochian%20magic" title="Wikipedia: Enochian magic">angelic magic</a>, it contains passages on cryptography.

<p>‚ÄìOh, not archaic. Large computer files like graphics have slack space in them, redundancy. You can embed other information in that space and the file doesn‚Äôt even look encrypted. Highet asked me about it when they first found these files. I wrote a decrypting program for him, it might still be on his, I mean your disk, it‚Äôs called stego. [pg344]</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes thanks I‚Äôll, be with you in a second Jeremy, oh look out for‚Ä¶ as the calfskin case came up over the corner of some boxes and banged against the doorframe. ‚ÄìConor let‚Äôs do this another time, I have to</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd my Rayleigh-Taylor work, can we talk about‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, later Conor, I‚Äôll see you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚Äìin an hour or so‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚Äìsee you haven‚Äôt opened, my goodness, what happened to your face?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust an, an allergy, it‚Äôs nothing. Opened what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe report, but there‚Äôs not much to worry about. We have to put a new property management system in place, that‚Äôs about the worst of it. But I ah, may I, may I‚Ä¶? Yes if you‚Äôd just move that, thank you. I‚Äôm concerned about this Dietz fellow. Did you get some kind of a letter from him?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI shut him down. That letter‚Äôs been classified.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs probably why he‚Äôs upset. He‚Äôs been telling everyone that his letter should go to the secretary. Not my business at this stage, but it might be best to let him make his point.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I‚Äôm, I‚Äôve really had it with people taking advantage of my, my good nature, Bernd is just going to have to, to, to come to terms.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes I‚Äôm sure he will. There‚Äôs one other thing I‚Äôm concerned about‚Ä¶ pushing aside Time Tactics Of Very Successful People to make space for Chivian-Harris, Boole &amp; Clay, Credne Waste Management. ‚ÄìHave you seen these?</p>
<p>‚Äì‚Ä¶no.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I‚Äôve glanced, but not, not in the context of any actionable, I mean any ah proactive kind of ah action‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, it could turn nasty. This CANT group, I have to say, they‚Äôre very adroit. You ah know someone with them, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot really.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey settled their Site Alpha suit, but there‚Äôs a number of other toxic plumes. The effluviants are covered in our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfund" title="Wikipedia: Superfund">Superfund</a> documents‚Ä¶ as three more thick folders came out of the calfskin case and Rector freed a sheet. ‚ÄìVolatile organic compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls, ethylene dibromide, benzene, tricholorethane, perchlorothane, lead, [pg345] strontium, iodine, merc[ury]</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook Jeremy is this, I mean you‚Äôre basically saying that there‚Äôs no immediate, I mean nothing‚Äôs wrong, right?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNothing‚Äôs wrong? But, we‚Äôre a Superfund site. We‚Äôre getting federal money to clean up th</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but that‚Äôs, I mean that‚Äôs baseline right that‚Äôs not news, we‚Äôre dealing with‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Rector squared documents against the calfskin case. ‚ÄìIt could be made into news if it seems we‚Äôre not doing our part. The EPA took a baseline reading in a schoolyard a half mile away and found plutonium concentrations of one point th</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlutonium? A half mile away? How did that happen?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo one‚Äôs sure. It could have come from a smokestack with a bad scrubber, but the concentration is localized. There was one incident in sixty seven, some plutonium released into the offsite sewers. One EPA official guessed that contaminated sludge might have been collected and sold as fertilizer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut how could that happen, aren‚Äôt there safeguards?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere are radiation gauges at our outflow points, but they were often turned off because of too many false positives. The waste could have entered the city sewers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, so people make mistakes, but, but, nineteen sixty seven? How is that news?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt may have been there that long, it‚Äôs just the readings that are recent. Also there‚Äôs the two mile long tritium plume, well at least tritium has a fairly short halflife, unlikely to surprise you thirty years later, but</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut this is, I mean‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm just saying, with the new construction and suspicions that might arise around these dual toxic reports, these older incidents could be used as a lever, you see?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut no, I don‚Äôt see.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCase by case these aren‚Äôt really my concern, but a pattern and practice of abuses is something I need to be aware of, especially if Superfund monies have been misused.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, pattern and prac..? Rector stood, snapping shut the calfskin [pg346] case. ‚ÄìBut what should I do?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator Chase is still in your corner, isn‚Äôt he?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs far as I, I, I mean I haven‚Äôt talked to him lately but</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, you might want to touch base there‚Ä¶ as the door shut on the binders and spiralback volumes of Conceptual Design Report now laid out like a patient on the table, diagrams and wireframe perspectives littering the floor where ‚ÄìConor! came sliding ‚ÄìLook out! across the carpet on the skid of 1..1.2 SYSTEM MANAGER APPROVAL Optics Bernd Dietz, crumpling it against the leg of Quine‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄìYo dude!

<p>‚ÄìWhat is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorry, jefe, but do you want to talk about my Rayleigh-Tay</p>

<p>‚ÄìOkay, I‚Äôll leave this on top of uh, is, is this your in basket‚Ä¶? the door closing on ‚ÄìGlenn, this is Philip. Can you get me some documents‚Ä¶? and a minute later he was stepping over Conceptual Design Report and FUDGE and Ohlone Val Anti-Nuke Group Brings Superfund Suit to reach the sink, where he stared into the mirror at a face almost healed of poison oak but looking no healthier for it, rummaging through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen" title="Wikipedia: Naproxen">Naproxen</a> Valerian St Johns Wort Ginkgo Biloba for an unmarked amber bottle, some blue pills incised with triangle<a href="#fn159" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> sitting in a residue of blue dust like a diorama of some distant and peaceful planet that offered a languor of the life more imminent than LANCET 1979-1991, or Growth Rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability in an Ablating Plasma, or <a href="http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10172219/10172219.pdf">DOE/RW-0184-R1 Characteristics of Potential Repository Wastes Volume 4</a>, a drowsiness diffusing a dimness like the ground fog thickening to obliterate the distant ridges where &lt;ULTRADIG&gt; had slit the hills and was scooping a new interchange past Codorn c s XIT NLY, solid with unmoving cars as somewhere up ahead blue and red flashes stained the fog and ∆é∆Ü–òA‚ÖÉU·ô†MA came up the shoulder in a blast of klaxon, but whatever misfortune or mortality had manifested there was gone with the fog next morning, leaving behind only a litter of bright glass pebbles, an oil stain, a crumpled strap of metal. The snout of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic%20enforcement%20camera" title="Wikipedia: Traffic enforcement camera">camera</a> presided over eight lanes of cars waiting then rushing at the patterned alternation of lights. Quine is his turn edged past FAST DIVORCE BANKRUPTCY with a pang more conspicuous for the singing of some bird, for the minute effulgency of bus exhaust blowing through the window rolled quickly shut against the bluebird‚Äôs tune which proved to be only the mechanical chirp of the traffic signal offering to assist any blind passerby foolish enough to brave those eight grumbling and irate lanes, chirp changing to a cuckoo as he turned to brake for EBMUD rolling away a stone, or was it only a manhole cover.</p>
<p>Back in the office he sat in what might have been silence but for the tinnitus in his ears, the construction coming to life out by the dry fountains, the inexorable press of the daily round, the sound of people trying not to say what they meant, yet he went on listening for that [pg348] unheard stillness within, as if some clue to his heart or to its safe passage through the world could be found in the world‚Äôs very exigency, if only he could wait long enough.</p>
<p>But each passing moment brought its new exigencies, like crows coming to land among the sheaves and binders and Growth Rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability. He gazed out from his desk at Mount Ohlone, its slopes covered with the long grasses now dried to dun and pale gold and amber and mauve and gray and violet. <em>Capsules below a certain energy failed to ignite because the hot spot will not achieve sufficient rho-r and temperature.</em> Scotch broom and lupines, their flows fallen, stretched out hard and hairy seed pods for the heat, orange poppies and purple thistles bloomed. <em>Typically, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types%20of%20mesh" title="Wikipedia: Types of mesh">computational mesh</a><a href="#fn160" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a> is too coarse to resolve steep, homogeneous plasma-density structures that might arise from uneven illumination or hydrodynamic instabilities.</em> High above arroyos Cathartes aura soared. <em>Because we lacked adequate models for certain pieces of the physics</em>, the leathery leaves of Rhus diversiloba were dark green and shiny with resin, innocently holding forth their pale berries.</p>

<p>‚ÄìDoes the Lancet test data square with the codes?</p>
<p>‚ÄìEight out of ten Lancet test capsules fizzled. According to our codes they all should have ignited.

<p>‚ÄìJust a, a little headache. [pg349]</p>
<p>‚Äìkind of to be expected really, I mean you put a little droplet like that under that much pressure, the instabilities are going to spin right out of control. What do you want to do with my paper?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes well I‚Äôm sure Bill Snell will want to, to review it, we‚Äôll have a meeting soon, okay and Conor‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes?</p>

<p>‚ÄìYeah, okay. You should take an aspirin or something‚Ä¶ bathroom he pushed aside Naproxen Valerian St.¬†John‚Äôs Wort for the amber bottle and shook out the last of the blue tablets. Outside the clamor of construction was continuous. When Szabo entered he barely looked up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs with Dietz, Frank?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, his protest? We classified it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe called Senator Chase, then he called a reporter.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, shit.</p>
<p>‚ÄìReassign him. Revealing anything in that letter is a classification breach.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, look, let me talk to him, I can manage him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo what I say!</p>

<p>‚ÄìTrouble? Tell you what the trouble is‚Ä¶ as he rummaged through Waste Repository Preliminary to come up with Growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability, ‚Äìtrouble is some tests done in the eighties the Lancet series you‚Äôve heard of it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes‚Ä¶ as a kind of wariness came into Szabo‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄìI worked on those, they gave us our first proof of principle, kind of the basis for Ava</p>

<p>‚ÄìI call two out of ten pretty damn good considering.</p>
<p>‚ÄìConsidering our codes predicted ten out of ten?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip you‚Äôve seen the codes you‚Äôve even worked with them you know we‚Äôre not capturing all the physics but</p>
<p>‚ÄìListen to me Frank construction starts in two years Bernd is screaming that Avalon might not come up to spec and now I find out that even if it does we might not get ignition, I don‚Äôt need this. Why [pg350] did I never see this data?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLancet? It‚Äôs been out there. It was gone over by review panels. I assumed you were up to speed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay. I see a problem here that threatens our deliverables. And that is not going to happen. I want you to write a full report on all the Lancet data, emphasizing any uncertainty in Avalon‚Äôs ignition threshold. I want this laid out for Reese in black and white.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, there‚Äôs no need. Reese knows. Talk to him. You submit a report like that now it‚Äôs just a red flag, he‚Äôll have to respond. He might even have to postpone Key Decision One, nobody wants that. That happens, then the elections, who knows, we could lose this, to another lab, or altogether. What do you want Philip, to blow the whistle on yourself? Reese knows there are no guarantee, he‚Äôs fine with our unknowns.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou seem awfully damn sure of what Reese is fine with.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôve worked together. We understand each other. I‚Äôll talk to him if you want, get some assurances in terms you‚Äôre comfortable with if that</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll talk to Reese. Meantime, write the report, Frank. I want to see it when I get back from this damned waste meeting in DC.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat, next week? I don‚Äôt have time to</p>
<p>‚ÄìNone of us has time‚Ä¶ and the door had barely shut when his face hardened and the phone was in his hand for ‚ÄìDolores, did you get Frank Szabo‚Äôs academic transcript yet‚Ä¶? and lingered there for MEM 5 as, waiting, he opened GAO/RCED-91-65 to <em>an organization saturated with cynicism, an arrogant disregard for authority, and a staggering pattern of denial</em>, dropping it for ‚ÄìReese‚Ä¶? I just wondered if you‚Äôd talked to Frank Szabo recently. He seems unhappy about something‚Ä¶ not sure what the problem is, maybe he feels slighted because he was passed over for director, but I can‚Äôt help that, I mean I promoted him to Avalon, doing everything I can think of‚Ä¶ not really, just hard to work with, this Dietz thing, you know? Thought he had that covered and now Dietz is calling everyone he can think of‚Ä¶ And this report he‚Äôs writing, about some test data from the eighties? Lancet? You‚Äôve heard of it? No, I don‚Äôt know what he means to prove by it‚Ä¶ just wondered if he‚Äôd shared anything with you‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt mean to trouble you with it, anyway I‚Äôll see you next week, we [pg351] can talk then. Yes I‚Äôm, I have it here, Characteristics of Potential Repository Wastes, is that, no wait, Radioactive Waste Inventories Revision Nine, is that‚Ä¶? Yes I‚Äôll get up to, up to speed here‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Night had fallen again out there beyond his notice, beyond his open blinds, where <em>375,000 cubic meters high level waste</em> awaited disposal, and the moonlit slopes of Mount Ohlone seemed as though his window gave upon the sylvan scene, <em>100,000 cubic meters transuranic waste</em>, where an owl left the harbor of a eucalyptus, <em>2.5 million cubic meters low level waste</em>, where two raccoons growled circling a squirrel carcass, <em>iodine neptunium cesium uranium zirconium half-lives of a million years</em>, where a rat crept softly through the vegetation.</p>
<p>He pulled the blinds closed. <em>To ensure isolation from the biosphere materials are placed in a geologic repository, buried underground in shallow pits, dumped at sea, or discarded by hydrofracture injection.</em> Some planet set in the west. <em>The latter two techniques were past practices and are no longer performed</em>. Saturn by its color. <em>This report does not report civilian nuclear waste.</em> A grove of live oak blocked all light except for shards of the moon fallen like leaves among them. <em>This report also does not report inventories of radioactive materials not classified as waste.</em> Crickets chirred. <em>Steel drums are certified for 300 years.</em> Moonlight rinsed the open range land, and further off the valley was filled with glittering points. <em>Pretreatment and immobilization processes have not yet been finalized.</em> On a breath of warm air Umbellularia broadcast its waft of mint and resin. <em>Estimates for certain other waste categories are not fully reported because of the current unavailability of data.</em> ‚ÄìArtemisia tridentata, Lynn said, breaking from a sagebrush a twig of gray leaves, pungent in her cupped palm. The warmth of her came with it. And at the far verge of the sylvan scene was always the floodlit terrain of the Lab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìStop, he whispered. A nausea came over him and he pushed aside the papers. A desolation gaped, engulfed him. He started</p>

<p>then collapsed it in fury. He delved into /highet/ seeking some reminder or revelation to feed that which grew by it, halting at /xxx/ where he brought up that anonymous wilderness of flesh where heat [pg351] went unsuccored by warmth, where the most sinuous invention devolved to the same predictable end, rousing within him something that sought a release not offered by this image or the next, until he was staring at russet highlights in cropped black hair fading to a fringe of down where it met the neck bent to sup at what in the next image sought lithe thighs to nest between until he pulled his attention from the figure to the ground, to the empty wineglass on the bedside table, the fallen shoe, the philodendron wilting in its tub there against the bare wall whose pixels, when examined closely, were suggestive as the brushstrokes of some secret writing. Over these he opened a new window for &gt;stego a0001.gif At once a flaunt of tongue vanished behind columns of numbers sleeting down the screen to stop with ZULU_DATE 560527 ZULU_TIME 1756.00000 LAT 11.360000 LONG 165.230000 HOB 3M YLD 3530KT OPERATION REDWING EVENT ZUNI DEVICE BASSOON. His face wore a kind of stubborn denial belied by his fingers clicking back up through measurements of radiation, neutron flux, x-rays. As if refusing to learn what he didn‚Äôt want to know, he commanded his fingers to close the window, but they betrayed him with &gt;stego *.gif, and one after another the enticements of parted lips and unclad climbs were lost in a blizzard of numbers that no rhythm of his frantic clicking could halt.</p>

<p>He stared into the heart of that comfortless light he could not remove from. everything had been revealed, all secrets exposed, and yet nothing had changed; somewhere his heart was crying like an abandoned pet, all was given up and given away, and the burden was still on him. In the darkness he pressed his fingers to his eyes, imagining what was out in the world now for the taking by any who guessed the key, and sparks bloomed on his lids, like the wheeling of birds, now black, now white, against a blank sky.

<p>Morning sun, insulting his sleepless eyes, glared from three folded newspapers each a day more distressed than the last: ivory, wheat, urine. On the hand extended to pick up Record Heat Wave More On Way, a mole he didn‚Äôt recall drew a blunt shadow over the ham of his thumb. In the house he paused long enough to drop his suitcase and pass the phone blinking 4, a clutter of styrofoam cartons in the kitchen, an empty box PapaGeno Pizza and a trail of ants moving across it, and then he was back out under the heat of the sky, that molten blue shell beyond which was mere vacuum littered with the stony threats of a hammering that echoed the walls of Building 101 where he turned the wheel to skirt <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/putz">Putz</a>meister P30 growling at the dry fountains where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIDGID" title="Wikipedia: RIDGID">RIDGID</a> shot a halo of sawdust into the air and turned again around a motorized cart loaded with canisters <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichlorodifluoromethane" title="Wikipedia: Dichlorodifluoromethane">Dichlorodifluoromethane</a> CFC-12 Freon while the radio informed him that ‚Äìthe nuclear weapon is obsolete.

<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs this, I‚Äôm down as a speaker?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat I‚Äôm trying to tell you Philip in about five minutes. It‚Äôs just an introduction. R√©ti will do the keynote. You just say welcome, and then you‚Äôre out of there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs this Highet‚Äôs idea of how to get back in here? Is this some kind of coup?</p>

I agree Reese, Frank is a capable scientist but here‚Äôs my thought, if he can‚Äôt exercise openness with something like this‚Ä¶ Well yes but this has been a recurring problem, his what can I say pushiness his confrontational style insistence on having things his own way, playing fast and [pg361] loose with‚Ä¶ Yes but my point is isn‚Äôt it better to send that signal now? I mean if we get some, some show stopper coming up later will he be honest with us? I mean we agree don‚Äôt we that Bernd‚Äôs problem with the optics is, is fixable, right? But I worry about this Lancet‚Ä¶ Review panels, I know, but do they know all the details because I‚Äôve been looking at. And are you sure you‚Äôve seen everything, because I thought I had in fact Frank pretty much said I‚Äôd seen everything and then I found out‚Ä¶ well that‚Äôs what his report is supposed to address‚Ä¶ yes I do think it speaks to his, his reliability. And something else just came up, hate to, but look can I fax you something? Hold for one‚Ä¶ minute to avoid boxes binders papers o his way to the outer office where he stared at IntelliFAX Hook Hold Redial Function Mem and began touching buttons at random until DOE DP appeared in black on the ray panel and he pressed Start for COMPLETE LIST?

Just thought you, thought we should be on the, the same page‚Ä¶ fallen to the floor beneath the fax machine which went on humming as Quine rushed into the small theater where R√©ti was addressing perhaps a hundred people. Behind him was a whiteboard and flanking him were two large video monitors, the crystal image of a full moon on one, on the other a blurred amber limb of Jupiter marred by black dots. In the vacant back row Quine sat behind a couple of men who broke off their whispering to glance at him.</p>

<p>‚Äìand so we see there is a use for nuclear explosions in space after all. We see there is reason to reevaluate certain treaties we have signed, even as a new administration tries to enter into an even more terrible treaty, with the connivance and cooperation of some who should know better. But I will say this to you. No administration lasts forever. And I say that if this administration follows its present course, by ignoring this great threat and even more obvious terrestrial threat, it will have blood on its hands.</p>
<p>‚Äìbad news your blood‚Äôs all over the crime scene, good news your cholesterol‚Äôs one thirty, lost under a scatter of uncertain applause that swelled without conviction as R√©ti limped from the podium.</p>
<p>‚Äìkay we have film now from last night‚Äôs I should say yesterday morning‚Äôs impact quite spectacular maybe the biggest yet circa zero thirty three hours little behind the predicted ah okay Kev? Do we have that? Can we punch that up on a monitor?</p>
<p>R√©ti reached a seat in the front row. Next to him someone rose to help him sit, a bald spot turned and a broad nose appeared. Highet. On R√©ti‚Äôs other side was Szabo.</p>
<p>‚Äìpunching holes in the Jovian atmosphere each the size of the United States give you some idea what one might do to us</p>
<p>Szabo and Highet both seemed to be conferring with R√©ti. The second video monitor showed ‚Äìlunar images sent back by Persephone themselves a compelling argument for asteroid defense. You can see how many hits our neighbor in space has taken over a few billion years.</p>
<p>Szabo rose and walked toward the back of the theater. Quine made his way to the aisle a few steps behind. ‚ÄìFrank‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚Äìgive us some perspective on this threat welcome back our former director, Leo Highet.</p>
<p>Something like rain began. It took Quine by surprise, in the enclosed space, this growing rustle soon a freshet then a torrent. Highet came to the podium and waited for the applause to fade.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe nuclear weapon is <em>not</em> obsolete. There <em>is</em> a use for nuclear weapons in space. We‚Äôve just seen one.</p>
<p>The applause started again. Szabo was standing at Quine‚Äôs side. ‚ÄìIt [pg363] wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to have him back. Make him a director at large or something.</p>

<p>‚ÄìBut Doctor Quine I really need to‚Ä¶ as the importuning vanished behind the brushed steel doors closing for his stab at 5.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy is Highet here and why are you presenting a paper with him?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDidn‚Äôt know I had to clear it with you Philip, next time I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ as doors slid open on an empty hallway. ‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs the trouble anyway? I should be down there‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚ÄìI said I wanted it when I got back. [pg364]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know, but this asteroid con</p>

<p>‚ÄìSit down. Show you what I‚Äôve got here Frank‚Ä¶ rummaging for Growth Rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability, ‚ÄìListen to this‚Ä¶ After some growth, instabilities enter the nonlinear phase with mode coupling and saturation and convergence effects‚Ä¶ Mixing of the ice and gas layers instigated by the growth of irregularities will have a detrimental effect on fuel compression‚Ä¶ The nonlinear growth and turbulence properties are almost entirely a mystery‚Ä¶ The modeling of convergence and saturation effects have not been confirmed experimentally‚Ä¶ No general analytic solution for instability growth has been found, indeed there is no reason to think one exists‚Ä¶ Experiments on inner surface instability will commence soon‚Ä¶ soon, Frank? In other words we haven‚Äôt done anything yet‚Ä¶? The linear growth of instability is well understood in planar geometries‚Ä¶ Planar, Frank? aren‚Äôt we compressing spheres‚Ä¶? However, a simple argument based on numerical work makes it reasonable to assume‚Ä¶ is nature <em>reasonable</em>, Frank? Do the planets move in circles? Took over a thousand years to correct that <em>reasonable</em> assumption, and look at this from nineteen seventy four here‚Äôs the same damn equation we‚Äôre using now, tweaked the coefficients, fitted the curve, added a, a, a few epicycles, this isn‚Äôt physics it‚Äôs numerical analysis it‚Äôs, this is what I did on Radiance, we don‚Äôt have a clue what‚Äôs going on but let‚Äôs pull the curves into shape and claim quantitative agreement! Look at this, Frank, would you look at these curves, there could be an energy cliff here between ten and twenty megajoules, you see it? same damn equations from the seventies, Highet‚Äôs in fact, the ones he used to sell the first kilojoule laser, only now the curves have been goosed, some coefficients changed to make one point eight megajoules look like the threshold because, because that‚Äôs what we want now? This whole damn project I‚Äôm on the line for it‚Äôs just more tweak and squeak isn‚Äôt it!</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip will you calm down I‚Äôve worked on this for twenty years, we don‚Äôt have to capture the physics in every det</p>

<p>‚ÄìSo, what, we put a really nice graphical front end on twenty year old codes get animated full color videos, tart it up with a John Williams score if you want but do we understand it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip believe me everything‚Äôs fine, the CDR is accepted, we‚Äôre a slam dunk for Key Decision One, we‚Äôre right on track.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOn track for what, another billion dollar scandal?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip there are unknowns, everybody knows that, I mean Reese is fine with our unknowns they‚Äôre known unknowns we all know that</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd what about the, the unknown unknowns? Everything that comes up in the next year two years four years six years that we can‚Äôt see yet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm telling you, talk to Reese.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI did. He‚Äôs upset with how you handled Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìUpset‚Ä¶? The annoyance Szabo‚Äôd been holding in check flickered into caution. ‚ÄìI thought I had your support there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd he‚Äôs upset that your Lancet report isn‚Äôt on his desk. Frank, I supported you on Dietz but this Lancet stuff is over the top for me. I specifically asked you about it weeks before the CDR went in. I got vague assurances from you and I trusted them. Then I find out all this, and now you‚Äôre stonewalling on your report.</p>
<p>‚ÄîStonew, I haven‚Äôt had time! And I‚Äôm trying to, to‚Ä¶ The caution was losing coherence, trembling into something like fear. ‚ÄìWhat is this Philip? What are you really after?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrank, I did some checking. You don‚Äôt have a PhD.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus‚Ä¶ Szabo‚Äôs face was red, his voice shaking. ‚ÄìThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ for God‚Äôs sake. What is this? Everyone knows that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt surprised Reese.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Ä¶ I did the damned work! But I was hired straight on here, I was a Hertz fellow. So I didn‚Äôt finish my dissertation. They gave me seven years to finish it, but Christ Philip I was here, I had other priorities, you know?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou should have told me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChrist Philip. R√©ti knew, Highet knew‚Ä¶ What are you doing to me? [pg366]</p>
<p>‚ÄìProtecting the Lab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, this is bullshit. I‚Äôve worked here for twenty years. No one ever cared about my damn degree. What difference does it make?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOur integrity has to be above reproach. Because finally Frank trust is all we</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs it Bill Snell? No, it‚Äôs you, isn‚Äôt it. You set me up. Promoted me to make me vulnerable. This is what you did with Superbright. I watched that kid Thorpe crash and burn while you came up roses as the whistleblower. I don‚Äôt know what you said to Reese but it won‚Äôt work this time because you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. This isn‚Äôt some cowboy scheme of Highet‚Äôs you‚Äôre messing with, this is the future of the entire nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want you hiding potential problems on this laser.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA complex project like this, you give me a year to prove myself, but you can‚Äôt afford that can you because you‚Äôre a screwup and everyone here knows it and your interim appointment will be up before then and I‚Äôll have your chair. That‚Äôs what worries you isn‚Äôt it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôll find you another position, Frank.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn Siberia? In X Section with Dietz? Don‚Äôt bother. I‚Äôll take a personal leave.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Qui</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh Christ‚Ä¶ as Szabo pushed out past ‚ÄìDennis this isn‚Äôt a good ti</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I just, gee is he okay? You just need to see this before</p>
<p>‚ÄìGod damn it Dennis can‚Äôt you understand English I said</p>
<p>‚Äìfaxed this up last week but I guess you here that‚Äôs it there here let me oops, as he slipped and lurched forward jabbing Quine with Executive Summary M Section Participation And Potential Liability In Anodyne Placebomycin Trial.</p>
<p><em>Placebomycin was developed by M Section under a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement (CRADA) with Anodyne Medical Response, Inc. Doctors and HMOs have been seeking a pharmaceutical that could be prescribed for patients with self-limiting viral infections, such as flu or cold, in place of costly and inappropriate antibiotics that patients often insist upon.</em></p>
<p><em>Placebomycin has no active ingredients. The pill is an inert mixture of calcium carbonate, glucose, and magnesium stearate.</em> [pg367]</p>
<p><em>Clinical trials proved effective in 35% to 65% of cases, with patients receiving placebomycin recovering more quickly from elf-limiting viruses than patients who were told outright that they were receiving a placebo.</em></p>
<p><em>After development, Anodyne entered into agreements with various HMOs to provide placebomycin in quantity for specific use against self-limiting viruses. However, after distribution, production, and marketing costs were factored in, placebomycin proved to be as costly as conventional antibiotics, and the HMOs backed out of the agreement. In an attempt to recoup costs, Anodyne sold stocks of the drugs to hospitals and clinics in various Third World countries, where unfortunately it has been used outside its intended application, as a broad-spectrum antibiotic against pneumonia, staph, typhoid fever, meningitis, and other life-threatening bacterial infections. Since these diseases are not self-limiting viruses, placebomycin has proven less effective than in its clinical trials, with 5%-10% of patients recovering, a percentage which is slightly worse than those patients receiving no treatment.</em></p>
<p><em>Anodyne faces legal actions from several customers and has brought suit against the Laboratory for alleged violations of the CRADA. Our position is that the suit is frivolous and without merit and that no settlement should be offered.</em></p>
<p>‚ÄìSee we wanted to jumpstart the enterprise, get an object oriented production model in full fluence but you know how long traditional model pharmaceutical R&amp;D takes so we</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo you sold useless drugs to Third World hospitals.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell no, that was our customer Anodyne and anyw</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you consider, even for a second, what your customer might do with this stuff?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot really our concern as long as we execute in accordance with best business prac</p>
<p>‚ÄìDennis they were placebos!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell they were supposed to be used as antivirals not antibiotics that was part of the guidelines and anyway you see what counsel said we don‚Äôt have to worry because we</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you realize what you‚Äôve done? People have died!</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, they were sick anyway. I mean, it‚Äôs not like they had much [pg358] of a chance. And some of them did get better.<a href="#fn166" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìI, I don‚Äôt even know what to say to you. This is, talk about the Auschwitz touch, this is not even, you can‚Äôt even pretend it‚Äôs science it‚Äôs only money is that all you understand?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell you don‚Äôt have to get all huffy. I thought I was doing you a favor. It‚Äôs not like anyone around here knows how to run a business.</p>

Whatever agreement we‚Äôve got with you it‚Äôs terminated. You‚Äôre out of here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo offense but you‚Äôve got kind of an negative attitude. I was hoping we could work out a win-win synergy, look at our alternatives</p>
<p>‚ÄìAlternatives? What alternatives do these people have? They‚Äôre dead! Get out!</p>
<p>Outside the din of construction had resumed. Behind him his phone went off.</p>
<p>‚ÄìChrist can‚Äôt I get one single moment‚Ä¶ he dropped Executive Summary on the desk and charged into the hall, the phone fading to a suspicion of voices somewhere just around a corner as he turned for brushed steel doors that opened on Highet, insolent and at ease. ‚ÄìJust coming up to pay my resp, as Quine seized his arm and steered them both around a corner into the mauve and avocado of MEN swinging shut behind them to muffle the threat of voices approaching and passing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNice office, you ought to put some pictures on the wall, make the place yours. [pg369]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat are you doing here?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou seem stressed, Philip. Are you taking your meds?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou think you can still get those things up there one way or another.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean Slingshot? Oh, they will be up there one way or another. I like my way better than letting North Korea do it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat and your setup with those rigged fusion codes. Those Lancet tests.</p>

<p>‚ÄìIf you‚Äôd worked half as hard on Superbright we might have something to show for it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSuperbright never had a chance of working.</p>

<p>‚ÄìWhat about those pictures.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean my smut collection?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you do that? Hide that data there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìEven you don‚Äôt believe that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen who?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho? Probably some disgruntled employee who felt ripped off. Probably could have avoided it if Nullpoint had worked out.</p>
<p>‚ÄìConor says these files were downloaded hundreds of times. Copies are in the open. And you didn‚Äôt tell DOE?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn Quine‚Äôs silence, Highet passed his hand under the sink‚Äôs photocell. The faucet came to life for an unstable flow of water that died to a drop speaking measuredly of an accommodation between surface tension and gravity.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow bad is it‚Ä¶? [pg370]</p>

<p>‚ÄìHello Bill. You‚Äôve met Philip Quine? Philip, Bill Venham.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou remember Vassili don‚Äôt you Leo, as blue serge turned to spraddle a urinal and Venham raised his voice above the chiming porcelain. ‚ÄìSo you‚Äôre the fellow kneecapped Radiance are you. Venham turned to the wall and raised his voice further. ‚ÄìI was set to make a few hundred million when production geared up. But I don‚Äôt hold a grudge. Maybe this asteroid thing will work out for us. Venham bounced on his toes as the Russian‚Äôs stream tapered off, and reached into a pocket as he turned from the wall. ‚ÄìYou ever need a job, you call me. Quine by reflex took a debossed business card ŒΩŒøœÖœÉ from the hand that Venham then wiped on his pantleg as the Russian stepped back from the urinal, adjusted and zipped himself with a heartfelt sigh. ‚ÄìBozhe moi.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWait how did you‚Ä¶ the seminar is restricted to the first floor‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Venham smiled as he held MEN wide for blue serge. ‚ÄìI‚Äôd say you have bigger troubles than us taking a leak in an SRD pissoir.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm still Q cleared, Philip. I‚Äôll see that these two aces get downstairs‚Ä¶ as MEN swung to and Quine, turning past the mirrors, caught sight of a face so gone in forsakenness and misery it could scarcely be accounted human, although those eyes still exposed a trapped and implacable sentience, caught without its diadem of reason.</p>
<p>Back in the office all was still but the mutter of his voice sorting through a lack of possibilities ‚Äìtalk to to to someone, she should be back by now‚Ä¶ as hands moved papers pausing at the torn edge of Test Ban Talks Break Off. He lifted the phone and tapped MEM 1 for ‚ÄìThis is Lynn Hamlin. I‚Äôm not at home right now, but‚Ä¶ He tapped MEM 2 and waited. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôve reached the offices of Cit, punching 303 for ‚ÄìLynn Hamlin. Is not in her, and dropped the handset on its hook.</p>

He punched again with a different code and waited for, ‚ÄìChrist is that how I sound‚Ä¶ his expression of distaste going dumbstruck yet rapt in the dry whisper of a distant voice settling as it might have been some weighty judgement. His eyes took in the tumulus of papers on and around the desk but the sapience behind those eyes regarded it all as some landscape seen from far off and already passing into irrelevance and forgetfulness. He was writing something down as Conor came into the office and began to speak but stopped as Quine reached for the phone again and jabbed at numbers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI need to speak to someone about a Robert Quine. I‚Äôm the son. Yes I‚Äôll hold, for the unguent of strings sliding through some Beatles tune as Conor stood at respectful attention. ‚ÄìYes this is Philip Quine. I was out of town. That‚Äôs all right. So what do I.

Again he rang the bell. As he stood there the lamp shut off of its own accord. He walked around to a chainlink fence that cut off the yard from a terrain of broken ground and hillside where in the moonlight a backhoe sat parked CREDNE CONSTRUCTION.

<p>From the freeway the distant floodlit perimeter of the Lab receded behind him. Jupiter, the concussions there ongoing but unseen, led the declining moon across a sky otherwise blanched by OHLONE LINCOLN [pg381] MERCURY and DA-NITE SELF-STOR 24 HRS and BAIT BEER GUNS until the stars came back point by point above dark orchards and wheeled over foothills of pale grass pocked with dark stones that seemed to have fallen from the crowded sky whose lucidity revealed them clear as day. He passed a lighted but unmanned kiosk at the start of the road‚Äôs climb up through pines. For an hour he wound through this darkness and came out of it among great domes of granite phosphorescent in the moonlight. At a lakeside he stopped while the moon, wearing an aureole, vanished in the teeth of the southern peaks as he stood near a whitebark pine, voiding. A bolide slanted down the sky in silence leaving a bright lingering trail.</p>
<p>Beyond the crest the road tipped down in switchbacks tracing the edge of some chasm just emerging in the predawn. He stopped where the road leveled in the valley and stood there drinking a can of iced tea and fueling the car under BP REGULAR 1.29<sup>9</sup> as the sun came up over waste an infecund desert. He turned south and the sun rose higher and its light fell like copper on the buttresses of granite to the west. The highway curved in toward that glowing splendor. Through the window came a rush of morning air, already warm. ahead the white road wound into mountains. On either side sang cicadas and dry grass.</p>
<p>He parked by an empty cistern and an exhausted well. His car was limed with dust. From somewhere sounded dry sterile thunder. Two military jets were gone far ahead of it, already vanished behind the scarp where snow still clung in rags. He climbed the dirt path, passing a rib of granite so cleanly broken that its pieces seemed cut and placed side by side, but for the sand and gravel in the crevices. The thin air scoured his lungs while the intensity of the sun for a moment seemed to suck the color from things.</p>

<p>‚ÄìMost of this equipment has Lab property stickers.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDecommissioned. Why, you want a PDP-10? Run a few legacy codes on it? I got some used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray" title="Wikipedia: Cray">Cray</a> parts I‚Äôll let go cheap.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm looking for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX%208000%23VAX%208500" title="Wikipedia: VAX 8000#VAX 8500">Vax 8500</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGot one right here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid you ever hear of steganography?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe murmurous woodwinds had lost an unequal battle with swelling strings and a baritone, all cut off by Root‚Äôs easy gesture. He went deftly among the boxes on the tone floor, examining items and placing them here or there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt mind me, got to keep workin, get this stuff out. Bill‚Äôs sellin to some Silicon valley cashout. I‚Äôm peeved with you there. If you hadn‚Äôt [pg383] shut Radiance down you‚Äôd still be on his A list and I‚Äôd still be in business here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìShut down? I thought it just moved offshore.</p>
<p>Root paused at the round table to pick up the dead cigar from the ashtray. He studied it and laid it down again on a sheaf of papers. ‚ÄìYou‚Äôre learnin, but not fast enough.</p>
<p>The cigar rested on Department of Defense Laser Master Plan. From where he stood he could read, <em>DOE is funding laser technologies with potentially large payoffs if leveraged properly to DoD weapons applications. New programs have opened the door to new lethality mechanisms with lower power thresholds than previously thought.</em><a href="#fn178" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> He looked from it to Root.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese things have a life of their own. Used to upset me to miss out on action. Once I worked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes%20Aircraft%20Company" title="Wikipedia: Hughes Aircraft Company">Hughes</a> and lost a whole radar detection system to a manager claimed it as his own. But eventually I come to realize that‚Äôs just ego. That‚Äôs just the way things get done. Managers change, credit and money falls like rain on the just and the unjust<a href="#fn179" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a>, but the work endures and the people who know, know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere are files on that Vax. Did you put them there?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSomeone did. Does it matter who?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI think it would matter to the DOE and the FBI.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt believe I know what we‚Äôre talkin about. But that steg, whatever you said. I do recall somethin about that. Trithemius was it? A book of occult knowledge. Doctor John Dee translated parts of it into English. Here was a man who claimed to speak with angels.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought you disliked education.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI say that? It‚Äôs a handy thing in others. An educated man always thinks he knows where he stands, even when you‚Äôve turned him around. I study up subjects when I can get some use of them but I‚Äôm not educated. You ever read up alchemy? Ought to be part of the science curriculum. Terrible frauds and mountebanks they were, taking kings and princes for fortunes. But I see that tricksters don‚Äôt interest you, and you‚Äôre right. As the flower maidens say, wir spielen nicht ums Gold<a href="#fn180" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a>. The ones who thought themselves learned, those were the real specimens. With their angels and demons and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon%23Gnosticism" title="Wikipedia: Archon#Gnosticism">archons</a>. Those strange and terrible powers that seek to possess and lay waste to the [pg384] Earth. Course you don‚Äôt need the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic%20gospels" title="Wikipedia: Gnostic gospels">Gnostic gospels</a> for that today, just read your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investors%20Business%20Daily" title="Wikipedia: Investors Business Daily">Investors Business Daily</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about those files.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs more, it might be, than what you‚Äôve found. Hidden in the plain sight of some eye or other.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHave you put up something new? Design codes?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThink I did it? I wouldn‚Äôt take such a chance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen who?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome bored bomb geek, may be. One of the old guys, ten or twelve tests under his belt, now he‚Äôs doin library work, one day he says, is this it? All I did to be locked away and forgotten? To hell with it. Let everybody know. What we did, what we learned. Or maybe someone just wants a better retirement package. Maybe it‚Äôs some peacenik who wants a, what do they call it, transparent regime of nonproliferation. A level playing field. And you, do you think there are things that shouldn‚Äôt be known? And you a scientist?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat I think isn‚Äôt important, these are national secrets.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd will you say that the crown jewels of America‚Äôs nuclear program went missing on your watch?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not taking the blame for treason.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTreason? Let me tell you of a greater treason. Did you ever meet Turner? Turner could have been a world class drunk or gambler but he went into physics. A great man, mind you, a visionary. He worked on Aeneas, you know what that was? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project%20Orion%20%28nuclear%20propulsion%29" title="Wikipedia: Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)">A spacecraft propelled by atom bombs</a>, one after another spit out the back like watermelon seeds. I worked on that with him when I was barely out of grad school. A great man. He also did the first work on pure fusion bombs, he wanted them for Aeneas cause they were clean, cut down on its radiation shielding. Then he turned round and he did the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neutron%20bomb" title="Wikipedia: neutron bomb">neutron bomb</a>, dirtiest weapon ever made. He taught me we could do anything at all, anything we wanted to, if we could get someone to pay for it. But more than just pay. To believe in it as well. To share in its unreason more than in its reasons. How he believed, how he could share that belief. Then one day he looked deep in to the fire and he flinched from it. Went to the other side and tried to undo all he had done. But you can‚Äôt put that fire out. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôre made of. That stardust. That nuclear waste. [pg385]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you know about waste.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know a thing or two. Turner is a waste. Much of my life is a waste. But it‚Äôs no treason. And what are you? A creature that won‚Äôt <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ensign#Verb">ensign</a> or renounce the thing that‚Äôs in you. A man engaged in treason against his very being.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt know anything about me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo I not? I know that every quantum of light in this world is a mark of our compact with that fire. We‚Äôre signed to it! Its name is written in our every atom. It‚Äôs not devil‚Äôs work. It‚Äôs the work of men like you and like me, and that‚Äôs why those outside the fence can‚Äôt countenance it, because it shatters their idea of humanity. Every man is called to it but few overcome the corruption of their hearts. And welcome it into their lives. You did for a time. Why betray it now? Don‚Äôt you know that every life lived is over in an instant? You don‚Äôt pick and choose your moment. When it comes, nothing is left of you in this world but your baseness and corruption, the corruption of matter. Unless you‚Äôve heeded that energy in your longing to be freed. Listen man. You pledged yourself to a fellowship but you broke from it. You scrupled and stepped back and judged your work and the work of your fellows before it was done. You lacked faith and you lacked trust not only in yourself but in the very work that was meant to redeem you and your fellows from all your baseness. For their sakes at least you should have set aside your selfish scruples.<a href="#fn181" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Have you never poured your soul into anything without asking: what is this? Never known the awful daring of a moment‚Äô surrender? I see in your face that you have. But you wouldn‚Äôt keep at this work. Why is that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you know about it? There‚Äôs no truth in you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn me? I should hope not! Is that where you look or truth? In the self? What is that? Is it this? Root gripped Quine‚Äôs shoulders and turned him so that the two faced the mirror. Root‚Äôs head loomed over Quine‚Äôs and almost affectionately he cradled Quine‚Äôs head between his great hands. ‚ÄìDo we explain the unknown by the unknowable? The truth if it‚Äôs anything is made by cunning and persuasion. By what we say. Didn‚Äôt Bohr believe that physics concerns only what we can say about nature?<a href="#fn182" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> Even Jesus preached. Was he the Son of Man because he made miracles? Or because he said he was? What if he‚Äôd kept silent? [pg385] What if he‚Äôd doubted, but lied? Truth, is it? I say, <em>who says?</em></p>
<p>‚ÄìLet go of me.</p>
<p>Root lowered his arms and stepped back, holding them out as if pleading some doctrine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is it you want? To shut down that Vax? Go on, I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôll do it myself. He strode to the far wall and reached behind a console. Panel lights went dark and a fan fell silent.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou want the disk? Like some conjuring act an electric screwdriver was in Root‚Äôs hand. He put it whining to screws in the console‚Äôs rack and one after another they fell on the flagstones. He grabbed and pulled free by its handles a unit the size of a dictionary. He offered it to Quine and spoke almost cajoling.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake it with you. As evidence for some trial if that‚Äôs what you want. No? What are you really after? Happiness? Is it that? Peace? But there is no peace. A reckoning is coming, don‚Äôt you feel it? Too many people, too many wants. There‚Äôs not world enough. Do you think the so-called truth will protect you when that time comes? When the grids go dark and there‚Äôs no food or warmth and every man‚Äôs sapience is set against every other for survival‚Äôs sake. You‚Äôll want every spark of your fire. That‚Äôs the world you‚Äôre aiming to enter armed only with your scruples and your faltering. But you could survive. I could teach you how. You could be a power, not one of the wrecked and the wretched for whom the only peace is defeat and death.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want anything from you. Just that disk.</p>
<p>Root held the heavy thing out in both hands like a salver. ‚ÄìStep closer then. Take it from me. Come and see what a reckoning is like.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre crazy.</p>
<p>Root turned and placed the disk on verity Systems V91M Bulk Tape Degausser. A red light on the machine blinked for part of a minute as Quine and Root stood watching each other.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that it? Is that what you want? That knowledge gone? It‚Äôs gone from the disk now. Let‚Äôs see you take it from the world.</p>
<p>Root smiled and swung the disk in one hand. He stepped forward and Quine moved to keep the table between them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHasn‚Äôt it come to you yet that there are matters weightier than [pg387] this mote you call a soul?</p>
<p>Root dropped the disk. It rebounded on the flagstones. ‚ÄìGo you forward. I haven‚Äôt given up on you yet.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the crest of the range he stopped in the afternoon light, stepping out into a roadside lot where thick cumulus hung overhead trailing a chill when they moved before the sun and cast their shadows over that long emptied riverbed of ice hewn when the first men ran chattering in packs on the savannah of another continent. He drove down the western slope into pines and a haze of smoke, slowing for Visitor Center where in a flash of lightning the cock on the rooftree flailed between compass points in a damp gust bringing a promise of rain unfulfilled as he came out from under the mutter of dry thunder and the towers of clouds rising behind him to darken the pines with shadows only and into the blaze and heat waver of the dry sea bottom, burning in the lens of the late afternoon, past BAIT BEER GUNS and DA-NITE SELF-STOR 24 HOURS, eyes burning, throat burning, all his senses burning in a worry of incitements as they sought some story, some rasping voice to explain this ‚Äìhostile world, the demise of the Soviet Union dunt mean we‚Äôre home scot free, we have Korea out there we have Iran out there we have Iraq out there we better be prepared to take these turkeys out, now here‚Äôs what Merica should do, we should tar and feather every congressman who votes against defense spending who votes against building a missile defense‚Ä¶ while the traffic thickened as countless cars flowed from its tributaries into the widening freeway while the rasping voice went on, ‚ÄìI‚Äôm a tell ya, most Mericans don‚Äôt know we can‚Äôt stop a missile attack. Most Mericans don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre defenseless. Most Mer, and he stabbed it to silence as the dash blinked JAM and he accelerated into the next lane with the needle climbing past 80 past 90 when the CD player blinked PLAY and a falsetto whined, ‚Äìgonna be just dirt in the ground<a href="#fn183" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<p>‚ÄìDamn it! Shut up‚Ä¶! banging the dash as his wheels trilled on the raised lane dividers and a horn snapped his head around to the panicked face of another drive too close as he yanked the wheel and the road slid on despite his foot wedged on the brake and the yank of the wheel back against a fishtailing swerve into a chorus of horns and [pg388] gaping faces traveling sideways past him until the car came up hard against a curb and stopped. He was on the shoulder turned sideways. Through the passenger window he saw traffic rush toward him and pass behind him. Ahead of him, smoke rose from fields of stubble, and a flight of bird, scattered by some disturbance, wheeled, now black, now white, against the empty burning sky.</p>
<p>In the heart of that light, lucid and inevitable, all that was scattered cohered. Superbright and all its progeny stood plain before him in conception and in detail and in its component part and its deepest strategies and in its awful and enticing radiance. He saw the design and the making of that device complete, and of further devices without end, and he stood apart from them as if it mattered not at all whether the deviser was himself or whether they came into being sooner or later. Trembling he stared across the burning fields and whispered, ‚ÄìStop. Stop. But the traffic rushed on.</p>

<p>Carter Scholz has not published fiction in a good many years; his return is cause for celebration.</p>
<p>The Cold War produced any number of cultural wonders, or distortions, depending on your point of view. (From my own point of view, both wonders and distortions.) The pressures placed on nations, cultures, individuals, have been horrendous. With the birth of the nuclear age, physics knew sin; chemistry has known it at least since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%20of%20the%20Haber%20process" title="Wikipedia: History of the Haber process">high explosives</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical%20weapons%20in%20World%20War%20I" title="Wikipedia: Chemical weapons in World War I">poison gas in World War I</a>.</p>
<p>And yet‚Ä¶ There has not been a World War since 1945. How will history judge the Cold Warriors? Perhaps more important, how will they judge themselves? [‚ÄìGreg Bear]</p>

<p>Quine approached the Labs on a road that led nowhere else. The morning light was thick, corpuscular. Behind the razorwire of the perimeter fence, cranes and water towers and incinerator stacks rose above the fortress city‚Äôs sprawl of buildings. Construction vehicles moved on the roads. Beyond, grassland stretched to hillsides yellow from drought and spotted with dark stands of live oak.</p>
<p>Soon he saw the protesters blocking the gate. Cars in both lanes were stopped. Blue lights and red lights flickered atop patrol cars on the road‚Äôs shoulders. Blackclad police formed a line between the protesters and the gate. Over chanting, rhythmic but unintelligible, rang a bullhorn‚Äôs clipped commands, and the protesters fell back from the roadway to the shoulders, the rhythm of their chant stumbling. A few remained kneeling before the gate. Three police holstered their batons and moved respectfully among them, like acolytes among devouts, helping them one by one to their feet and leading them within the gates to a waiting bus. The sequence of blockade, arrest, and release was by now ritual. The arrested chatted with their captors. [pg219]</p>
<p>As the cars edged forward Quine saw once again the darkhaired young woman in the crowd and once again felt the hollowing of his heart. Her resemblance to Kate, any reminder of Kate, still lanced him.</p>
<p>Two cars ahead, Leo Highet‚Äôs red convertible sounded its horn as Highet leaned out to heckle ‚ÄìGet a life! The woman flinched and Quine‚Äôs eyes locked on Highet‚Äôs head, the bald spot, the wedge of features visible in the rearview mirror, the broad nose and dark glasses. Past the gate Highet‚Äôs car sped into a right turn to the administration building while Quine drove on to the second checkpoint, then through a desert of broken rock, buried mines, and motion sensors on metal stalks like unliving plants. Past this moat he stopped at a third checkpoint, then parked in the shade of a concrete building with its blank walls and horizontal slits of embrasured windows, nervously thumbing the car radio ‚Äìtraffic and weather together, while he watched two younger scientists cross the lot and enter the building. Then he stilled the car and went in.</p>
<p>In his office one high horizontal window framed a blank oblong of sky. On the walls, left by the prior occupant and by Quine untouched, hung seismographs of bomb tests, the branched coils of particle decay, a geological map, electron micrographs of molecular etchings, a fractal mountainscape, all overlaid by memos, monthly construction maps, field test schedules, Everyone Needs To Know About Classification, cartoons, Technology Is What Sets Man Apart, and nearby a whiteboard thick with equations in four colors so long unwiped that Quine‚Äôs one pass with a wet rag had left the symbols down one edge ghosted but not eradicated, and a second desk, loose papers cascaded across its surface, the computer monitor topped by a seamsplit cardboard carton BERINGER GREY RIESLING and buttressed by books, manuals, folders, xeroxes, Autoregressive Modeling, Rings Fields and Groups, Leonardo da Vinci Notebooks, Numerical Solution of Differential Equations, Selling Yourself and Your Ideas! and under the desk banker‚Äôs boxes DESTROY AFTER and D NULL in black marker. Devon Null, the prior occupant, was ‚Äúon indefinite leave‚Äù. But when Quine had moved in, Highet had insisted that he leave Null‚Äôs half of the office untouched, either against Null‚Äôs return, or, as Quine was coming to believe, as a monument to disappearance.</p>
<p>Quine checked his computer mail. Most of the messages were notices, chaffing, power plays, trivia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A memorial service will be held Nov. 1 for Al Hazen who died Oct. 27 following a length illness. He was 51. Hazen worked with the Weapons Test Group at Site 600. Donations in his memory may be made to the American Cancer Society. [pg220]</p>

<p>One message could not be ignored:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Date:</code> Thu 31 Oct 12:10 EST<br /><code>From:</code> Leo Highet <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/email-protection#4033262f323a21002d292c212e2f">sforza@milano</a><br /><code>To:</code> Philip Quine <a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/email-protection#4736322e29220734333e3f">quine@styx</a><br /><code>Subject:</code> Radiance<br /><code>Cc:</code> dietz@styx, szabo@styx, kihara@dis, huygens@aries, lb@dioce</p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>As you know, the Beltway boys are coming and it is CRUCIAL that they go home awed. I want confidence, energy and style. There are unanswered questions and we will take hits on those. Meeting at noon today to brainstorm our approach, bldg 101, rm 210.</p>
<p><em>Highet</em></p>
<p>‚ÄúTo apply and direct this vast new potential of destructive energy excited the inventive genius of Leonardo as had few other enterprises.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More galling than the message was Highet‚Äôs new computer log-in <em>sforza</em> and his closing quote. This inspirational conceit, that they were all Renaissance <em>maestri</em> under the gentle patronage of Prince Leo the High, had come ironically from Quine, who was reading about da Vinci‚Äôs eighteen years as military engineer under Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. Leonardo had written, ‚ÄúI hate war, as all rational men hate it, but there seems no escape from its bestial madness.‚Äù Not while men of genius bend their talents to it, Quine had added. Here was Highet‚Äôs response.</p>
<p>Highet. What a piece of work. Builder and destroyer of his own legend. A fecund theorist but a distracted experimenter, an indifferent administrator but a champion politician. Most Lab scientists considered themselves above the funding process, but Highet tracked it as carefully as any experiment. From the start of his career he had traveled often to the capital, made himself known and available to congressmen and their staffs. In reward for such attentions he was at a young age appointed technical representative to a disarmament conference. His conduct was impeccable until one afternoon, goaded by the other side‚Äôs mendacious presentation and by his own ungovernable need to occupy the center of every situation, he let slip classified data.</p>
<p>Highet made allies sooner than friends, and enemies sooner than either. His allies were silent while his enemies leapt to break him. But Highet made the first of the hairsbreadth escapes on which his legend was built. A paper published a year before, cosigned by the President‚Äôs science advisor, had exposed the same secret. The hearings were dropped and Highet was exiled to an underfunded oubliette of the Labs housed in temporary trailers - J Section. [pg221]</p>
<p>Anyone else would have languished there. But Highet built by inches a power base, using his charisma to attract the brightest, most driven graduate students he could find, forming in the meantime new political alliances. When Congress at last funded Radiance, all the necessary talent was in J Section, and fiercely loyal to Highet. Soon he was associate director.</p>
<p>Radiance‚Äôs charter was to develop energy weapons of all types, but Highet‚Äôs hope and pet was the Superbright: an orbiting battle station of hairthin rods webbed round a nuclear bomb. The bomb‚Äôs fireball would excite the rods, focusing its energy into beams that would flash out to strike down enemy missiles, all in the microsecond before the station consumed itself.</p>
<p>So far the beams flashed out only in theory. The theory, originated by Null, seemed to Quine sound, but the more he studied the computer model, the less he understood why Null‚Äôs last test had produced even the ghost of a beam. No subsequent tests had shown it. Yet the farther tests fell behind expectations, the more strident became Highet‚Äôs public claims. Warren Slater, in charge of testing, at last resigned in protest. His letter of resignation was classified and squelched. Bernd Dietz had taken interim charge of testing, and to Quine had fallen the task of finding in disappointing test data any optimism about the promised results.</p>
<p>With the showpiece of his career vulnerable, Highet had grown more reckless than ever. He began showing up at high profile, high tech conferences and seminars, on neural nets, genetic programming, nanotechnology, virtual reality, cold fusion, artificial life, making no discriminations between the cutting edge, the speculative, and the snake oil, as if the force of his character could remake physical law. He spoke in banquet halls at Red Lion Inns, he passed out abstracts, offprints, videotapes, he painted futures brighter and more definite than the present, with himself and his visions at the center of them, inviting the wise and the bold to sit with him in the prosperity and rectitude of that inner circle, outside which was darkness, barbarism, and chaos.</p>
<p><em>And many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.</em> Again the voice. Quine recognized the line from Leonardo‚Äôs <em>Notebooks</em>. In the mind‚Äôs shadows were countless voices, dead, living, unborn. Since working on Radiance he had dreamed them. Now they irrupted into his waking life.</p>
<p>On his second computer, secure in steel shielding, waited Quine‚Äôs simulation of the rods. Abstract figures gyred in bright colors on the screen. The bland satisfactions of programming. The self-contained machine worlds. It was near to pornography, gaudy and without nuance. Any halfbright notion could be simulated, the simulation tweaked to success, and the success conjured as proof for funding. Realization was, as Highet might [pg222] put it, a ‚Äúmaterials‚Äù problem, an exercise left to minions. Bend your backs, men, to prove this golden turd of an idea. The display glitched and broke into the debugger. Lines of code filled the screen, void qelem, malloc (xarray), atof (nptr), an arcane pidgin halfway to madness. He ceased to see the words, his eye grasping instead the pixels, the shards of contained light the characters comprised.</p>
<p>What is light? The great mystery. Surfaces boil with quantum fire. How comes this dumb swarming to write beauty, alarm, or desolation on our souls? Eyes are the questing front of the brain, and channel to the heart. The eye may not, as Archytas thought, emit illuminating rays, but our modern understanding is no surer.</p>
<p>Mind‚Äôs eye and heart‚Äôs channel presented him now Kate‚Äôs russet hair, full mouth and cheeks, dimpled chin, dark eyes framed by wire glasses. Like a key those features fit his heart. Her flexed shoulder blades under a leotard‚Äôs scooped back. In a yoga class they‚Äôd met. Flirting, lunch, a few dates. She was twenty-three, he thirty-four. Hence his reticence, and paradoxically his faith that the years between them were his to reclaim at will. Her attention augured it. But when at last he bared his need for joy and hope, so long put by, it came out a bitter plea. Save me. Who wouldn‚Äôt flee from that? She regarded him kindly. Oh, Philip, the moment‚Äôs passed. It just didn‚Äôt happen for us. There‚Äôs someone else.</p>
<p>That the moment could pass. That he had let it. Had not seen it passing. Almost two years since and still it pained. His hand sought his carotid artery. Sixteen in ten seconds: ninety-six. Everything now cause for alarm: gas pains, headaches, shortness of breath, specks in his vision. The blue pills with their excised triangle. Not at work. Certainly not with a meeting.</p>
<p>The morning was gone to no end. Since failing with Kate he seemed to fail at everything, and he saw in all his life only patterns of failure and emptiness.</p>
<hr />
<p>Quine avoided that part of the building where Highet‚Äôs young theorists worked, X Section, or, as the older men called it, the Playpen. But today his customary exit was blocked by a tour group of weary adults and bored children in facepaint, their guide saying, ‚Äìtiny robots that actually repair human cells, as he swerved past a sign WARNING TOUR IN PROGRESS NON-CLASSIFIED CONVERSATION ONLY to the swell of the Brahms Requiem in full clash with The Butthole Surfers and a rapid din of simulated combat followed by the admiring exclamation, ‚ÄìStudly! Big win! and laughter fading as he passed an open room in which three refrigerators stood flanked floor to ceiling by case upon case of soda, and veered into a stairwell clattering down metal steps to a metal door held open by a wastebasket and silent [pg223] despite EMERGENCY EXIT ALARM WILL SOUND and emerged onto a loading dock between brown Dumpsters NOT FOR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE stepping down onto a paved path then jumping back to dodge a white electric cart DAIHATSU jouncing onto a debris of torn asphalt and treadmarked dirt past chainlink CREDNE CONSTRUCTION and three blue PORT-O-LET stalls to vanish behind three glossy cylindrical tanks COMPOSIT PLASTEEL CONTAINMENT DO NOT INSTALL WITHOUT READING PLASTEEL KIT B INSTRUCTIONS, on past temporary trailers holding his mouth and nose against the stench of bright green flux oozing from an open pipe into gray earth, until he regained the main road and passed the checkpoint, showing his badge, to enter Building 101, passing through the lobby in which for the edification of visitors and the inspiration of employees were displayed models of bombs, lasers, satellites, boosters, and photos of the celebrated Nobelists who‚Äôd devised them, and on to the conference room where all but Highet had arrived.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe was one of these, shall I say, Marxist radical types. He was so radical his mother cut him out of the family money. Hello, Philip. We‚Äôre waiting for Leo as usual. So he‚Äôs in Prague now selling laptop computers to the Czechs. Ah, the man himself.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWho‚Äôs this you‚Äôre talking about, sounds like he‚Äôs figured out that free markets are diplomacy by other means. Everyone, this is Jef Thorpe, postdoc from the University of Utah, he‚Äôs here to look us over. Jef worked with Fish and Himmelhoch on cold fusion, and I just want to say don‚Äôt believe everything you read in <em>Nature</em>, something‚Äôs happening there, someday we‚Äôll look into it ourselves. Jef, Aron Kihara, our new press officer, takes the heat for my excesses. Bernd Dietz, materials and research. Frank Szabo, systems integration. Phil Quine, our X-ray focusing guru. Philip, Jef‚Äôs done interesting work in your area, you should talk to him. All present? Let‚Äôs do it.</p>
<p>Highet seated the young man opposite Quine, jeans, dark jacket over T-shirt, black hair, high color, a small gold stud through his left nostril, his presence a breach of protocol and probably security, though the others knew better than to say so.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou all see the news last night? About the protest? We won. We won because we got to go last. First the protesters, out on the street, wind noise, harsh lighting, then our rebuttal from our respectable office. They put us last because we provided closure. So that‚Äôs our model for the presentation: beginning, middle, end. Begin with our successes, footage of tests. Middle: video simulation, highlighting potential problems. By defining the problems we control the questions. End with entirely new approaches and spinoffs. Aron‚Äôs running the show, but I may break in at any point. [pg224]</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, can we skip the last part, the science fiction?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, Bernd. Past, present, future. Closure. Without this you leave people ready to ask questions.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre avoiding questions?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot if they‚Äôre intelligent and informed but we have a few critics and wise guys on this panel and I‚Äôd like to keep it simple.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, I have more respect for the intelligence of Senators. Congressmen are not always so bright but</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd, it‚Äôs simple courtesy. We inform them at a level that‚Äôs neither condescending nor technical, we assure them their money is being well spent, show them how, say thanks so much.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSalesmanship.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGrow up, Bernd, a couple times a year I ask you to do this. Is the money well spent? Yes or no.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, yes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd ah, feel better if we could discuss the middle part in detail, there are just some questions that I‚Äôm not comfortable to address without ah, just a little more input. For example the focusing data‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron, only Slater has questioned that data, and he‚Äôs gone. Discredited. Focus is now Philip‚Äôs baby.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, it‚Äôs one, said Quine. ‚ÄìFocus, brightness‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut we‚Äôre within an order of magnitude?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt see any quantitative agreement with theory. The tests have shown a few bright spots. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm willing to commit to.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs all you‚Äôve committed to for what is it ten months now Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt see any fundamentals. I‚Äôm beginning to wonder</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you pulling a Slater on me, Philip? Because I want to tell you something, all of you. Some people in the lower echelons are making Slater out to be some kind of hero. To me this man was a menace to every one of us because he didn‚Äôt care about winning. He didn‚Äôt know what he wanted out of life and wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get it if he had known. I have no respect for parasites like that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, Null had a brilliant notion and we should pursue it, but that‚Äôs all it is so far, a notion. We</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo one‚Äôs questioned Null‚Äôs theory, no one, not even critics.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure but it‚Äôs a long way from there to even a prototype</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have supporting test data</p>
<p>‚Äìwhich may or may not mean qualitative agreement may or may not, but never quantitative, we have no understan</p>
<p>‚Äìwell you‚Äôre the one with the models Philip lo these many [pg225]</p>
<p>‚Äìand you‚Äôre the one who said this was a long term project, your words, long term, now suddenly</p>
<p>‚Äìoh sure, and if we all had seven lives</p>
<p>‚Äìnow there‚Äôs a little pressure it‚Äôs</p>
<p>‚Äìwhat I‚Äôm hearing</p>
<p>‚Äìit‚Äôs suddenly urgent</p>
<p>‚Äìwhat I‚Äôm hearing from you Philip is that we need more shots. Convey that necessity to our guests when they‚Äôre here, think you can do that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI won‚Äôt pretend there‚Äôs focus</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre not going to give me an inch are you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot on the basis of spotty data I can‚Äôt interpret.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI tell you what. There‚Äôs an eighty kiloton shot next Saturday. That‚Äôs your baby, Bernd? Philip, piggyback it. Get yourself some better data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn what, a week? Design and fabricate apparatus in a week?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNine days. Jef can help you if he sticks around.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow hold on</p>
<p>‚ÄìGet off the pot. Let‚Äôs move to Frank‚Äôs contribution. You‚Äôve all read it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre moving on.</p>
<p>There was a brief silence in which papers rustled.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNothing new here, said Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs its strength. We‚Äôve taken heat on pre-production technologies. This is a simple, viable off-the-shelf option, an element of the overall system. It‚Äôs an easy sell. Contractors are lining up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs also good show-and-tell, said Szabo. We can point to a card cage, this is the guidance system a year ago, then hold up a wafer, here it is today. Tangible progress.</p>
<p>Dietz continued to study the paper. ‚ÄìThese are Baldur anti-satellite missiles in a smaller package.</p>
<p>‚ÄìClose enough.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese were shelved over ten years ago as a violation of the ASAT treaty.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat toilet paper? Let that worry us we might as well pack it in.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese are not by any stretch of the imagination directed energy weapons. You want to put, what does it say, five thousand of these in orbit‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre pursuing many options, Bernd. These would be one layer of an overall shield. It‚Äôs a long way to deployment. Oh and we get something else totally for free with Frank‚Äôs idea. Always think dual use. Put a warhead on these guys they‚Äôre earth penetrators, aim them downward get a thousand g [pg226] impact, three k p s terminal velocity, earth-coupled shock waves destroy hardened shelters. We have a friend in the Pentagon who‚Äôs hard for that and the Beltway boys know it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWait just, you mean, this, these ah interceptors are for the presentation? But it‚Äôs, we need to address the existing problems, that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre coming for, we can‚Äôt feed them something totally new! And with this Slater thing</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron, trust me, it‚Äôs the best possible thing to do. As far as Slater goes, he‚Äôs history, a blip, not even an incident. This visit was scheduled long before he had his snit. Sure we‚Äôll get closer scrutiny than we would in the average dog-and-pony but call it an opportunity. Remember NORAD‚Äôs well-publicized false alarms and screwups, they got a billion-dollar facelift out of it. You up to seed now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell yes, I mean, no not on the interceptors but‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìJust put Frank‚Äôs paper in the kit, I‚Äôll step in. Oh, and make sure everyone gets a souvenir.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA, I‚Äôm sorry?</p>
<p>‚ÄìA souvenir. What are you giving the kids for family day today?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, some laser-etched aluminum disks‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood. Run off half a dozen make it a dozen more etched with the Radiance logo, can you do that? And glossies of the new artist‚Äôs renderings.</p>
<p>Highet was out the door before anyone else had left their seat. Thorpe, abandoned, stood but did not move quickly enough to follow the older man out. As the seated men studied him incuriously he blushed and exited.</p>
<p>The others then rose. Szabo went out singing under his breath, ‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a long way to deployment, it‚Äôs a long way, I know. In the meantime, we have employment, it‚Äôs the stick that makes us go‚Ä¶</p>
<p>At the doorway Dietz said to Quine, ‚ÄìOutrageous that he should bring a boy into that meeting and criticize you this way. Easy for him to make promises, but when the promises are not so easy to deliver we suffer for them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think the boy knew what he was getting into.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTell me what you want added to this test as soon as possible. He has put our asses on the line, both of us.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll send you e-mail.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSouvenirs! He gives senators souvenirs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Quine had come to the Labs at R√©ti‚Äôs invitation, R√©ti, the legend, intimate of Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, founder of the Labs. Impossible to refuse. R√©ti had for one semester graced Quine‚Äôs university with his presence, where he‚Äôd sat on Quine‚Äôs doctoral committee. Quine must have made an impression, for two years later R√©ti called him. I hear you are working [pg227] hard on some good ideas. How would you like unlimited resources for this work? Come for the summer, work on what you will.</p>
<p>Quine and Sorokin, a fellow postdoc, had isolated the emission of a single photon from a calcium source in order to determine whether a lone quantum displayed wave-particle complementarity. They‚Äôd refined their approach for two years, paring it to essentials, designing an experiment they had a hope of realizing with the school‚Äôs meager resources. Elegance born of need. In one month at the Labs Quine designed and built a detector acute enough. The experiment came off on the first try. Both tunneling and anticoincidence were evident. They had touched the central mystery. Even a single photon is both particle and wave.</p>
<p>Quine stayed; after that there was never a question of it. Not till much later did he guess that he‚Äôd been played. That R√©ti had waited two years before approaching him for a reason. That by then his work was ripe for plucking, and the Lab‚Äôs resources had little to do with its fruition apart from giving them the juice of it.</p>
<p>His paper brought him a celebrity almost grace. Unlimited time to think. No assigned duties. And the mysteries ceased to open to him. Idle, he took on a Lab problem, quantum optics of X-ray mirrors. He welcomed the work, as though it paid some tithe of mind to the practical. And it was interesting science, but finally it was, as the pioneers had with exact irony called their first bomb, a ‚Äúgadget‚Äù. A solution that laid bare first principles was useless if it couldn‚Äôt kill missiles. So his mirrors never passed a design review, but he was left alone to fiddle with quantum optics for telescopes and such. Then Radiance geared up, and his modeling software proved flexible enough to accommodate the next idea: the bombpumped Superbright. Opportunistic as a virus, the Labs exploited any evident skill. And so he was out of quantum optics and into weapons modeling. He became busy. Still he kept silent faith with the mysteries. He would return to them when the pressures of the moment were past. Programming took only the surface of his mind; its capital he held in reserve. But Quine could feign reserve, even to himself, while reserving nothing, and he came at last to understand that he did well at programming precisely because he brought his all to it. Nothing was left over.</p>
<hr />
<p>When he left the building the sun was low. The air was warm, and as he started the car the radio blurted ‚Äìrecord temp, before he silenced it.</p>
<p>Through the gate traffic slowed. Demonstrators in costume paraded in the road. Quine edged forward through skeletons and spooks with signs and props, TECHNOLOGIES OF DEATH, a longrobed mantis-headed figure towering on stilts above the crowd, tambourines jangling, EL D√çA DE LOS MUERTOS, and lab security herding the crowd off the road. As he cleared the [pg228] crowd a klaxon blared. The mantis swayed, tugging at robes snagged on the perimeter razorwire as the entrance gates slid shut, alarm lights strobing. On the inner perimeter road security vehicles appeared racing. Then he saw standing by his passenger window the woman who resembled Kate. She wore black spandex bicycle pants and a blue chambray shirt. She was staring at the gate. Quine hesitated, then rolled down the window.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou want a ride out of here? They‚Äôre going to start arresting people.</p>
<p>She looked at him, then back at the gate. On the main road Quine saw a flurry of approaching lights. City police.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt wait.</p>
<p>Whoops blasts squeals cut the crowd noise. She saw the vehicles approaching and with something like annoyance got into Quine‚Äôs car. Quine sped away shutting his window against the shriek of the passing vehicles.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm Philip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn. Did you see what happened?</p>
<p>When he looked at her all resemblance to Kate fell away. Same body type, same round features, but hair almost black with just a russet tinge, cropped close to the neck. No glasses. Dark penetrating eyes. Tanned calves darkly downed, lithe as a huntress‚Äôs. No key turned in his heart, just a faint echo of loss.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe one on stilts, his costume caught on the fence. It must have set off the alarm.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWere you there for the demo?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo. I work there.</p>
<p>His ID was still clipped to his jacket. She had been looking at it, and now she smiled slightly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you work on?</p>
<p>He turned onto a road parallel to the freeway where earthmovers were parked in debris-filled lots between emporia of sporting goods, fast food, auto parts, videotapes, computers, discount carpets. Sun flashed through the struts of a half-finished retaining wall.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDefensive weapons. Where can I take you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean Radiance. Do you believe in it?</p>
<p><em>And those in the anterooms of Hell demur, saying, I do not approve of what goes on inside.</em></p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs what I do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know what Einstein said? That you can‚Äôt simultaneously prepare for war and prevent it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhere can I take you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDrop me at the corner of Mariposa.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe didn‚Äôt hear about the evening protest. The organizers usually let us know. [pg229]</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe they‚Äôre tired of playing your game.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not my game.</p>
<p>A green sign with white letters MARIPOSA hung over the intersection. Quine pulled to the curb by a bus stop bench placarded FAST DIVORCE BANKRUPTCY. She turned to him with sudden vehemence.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut isn‚Äôt it a waste now that the cold war</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, and hearing annoyance in his voice he immediately stanched it, ‚Äìeven if I, it‚Äôs classified and I work, I only work on a small part of it, I don‚Äôt even know‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThese demonstrations won‚Äôt stop, you know. Until you do. You don‚Äôt know how angry people are.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen I‚Äôll probably see you again out there, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou will.</p>
<p>She unbuckled her seatbelt. Suddenly he wanted to know her.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWould you have lunch with me some day?</p>
<p>She looked at him incredulously. ‚ÄìLunch? With you? But why?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause I‚Äôd like to talk to you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo we have anything to say to each other?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe not. But if even you and I can‚Äôt talk, what hope‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre the enemy. Her eyes fixed on him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh well if you feel that way</p>
<p>‚ÄìI do!</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen there‚Äôs nothing, squeal of brakes obscuring his words as a bus pulled to the curb ahead of him. She was out the door before he felt the protest of his heart. So even now he had not relinquished some forlorn hope of starting over.</p>
<p>When he reached home Nan‚Äôs car was in the lot. Most Tuesday nights she spent here at Quine‚Äôs. He went to her place Friday nights and some weekends. But he‚Äôd worked late Tuesday, so they‚Äôd shifted it to tonight. He‚Äôd forgotten.</p>
<p>Nan worked in another section of the Labs, handling personnel files. He had met her after failing with Kate. He had never told her about that. She was so unlike Kate. Her features were sharp and fine, her skin pale, her straight auburn hair just starting to show gray, her slight body always dressed with a style that in its impeccability read as a brave front.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLo, she called as he entered, ‚ÄìIn the kitchen. I picked up some tortellini at Il Fornaio and a salad, is that okay?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSome bread in the oven, can you get that?</p>
<p>She chattered about her day, a seniority conflict in her department. Quine‚Äôs patience wore. When, setting the plates down, she bent to kiss his neck, he stiffened and pulled away. [pg230]</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs wrong?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet‚Äôs going mad again. A Congressional visit‚Äôs coming up, it should be routine, but he acts like the program‚Äôs at stake.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFirst he drops Null‚Äôs work in my lap, then today he starts pimping some lunatic idea of Szabo‚Äôs, and assigns me a postdoc like, like some kind of chaperone‚Ä¶ and the protesters.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat about them?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôre getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHave you made any progress?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo I haven‚Äôt made any progress. There‚Äôs no progress to be made!</p>
<p>‚ÄìPlease don‚Äôt snap at me, Philip.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt even discuss it, you don‚Äôt have the clearance.</p>
<p>She carried dishes into the kitchen without speaking.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook, I have an insane deadline. I won‚Äôt be able to see you for a week or so.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre seeing Ginny and Bill on Sunday, I thought.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sorry I just can‚Äôt.</p>
<p>She sighed and left the kitchen. In the living room the television came on. When after a moment he entered the room he heard her in the bedroom speaking on the telephone. Remote control in hand he viewed a cool panoptic tumble of war famine catastrophe enormity larded with a fantastic plenty of goods caressed by smiling tanned models, to pause on the logotype of Martin Marietta, ‚Äìa proud supporter for twenty-five years of science programming on public television, his impulse to switch again frozen by the worn, imposing face of Horatiu R√©ti, saying, ‚ÄìThere is now a cult of the beautiful theory. But how beautiful is reality? These so-called beautiful theories, these elegant mathematics are not verified by experiment. Experiment shows us a mess of a universe with over a hundred basic particles and three irreconcilable forces. We would like to unify them all, just as we would like to smooth over all the political differences in the world. But experience shows, in physics and in politics, that this is not always possible.</p>
<p>Abruptly the screen blanked then cleared to the involute radiance of the bomb. Sun‚Äôs heart. Cosmic ground. Siva and Devi coupling. A thin roar issued from the set and the waspish voice rode over it, ‚ÄìThe duty of science is to pursue knowledge even if it leads to the unbeautiful. Or to the evil. How else learn about evil?</p>
<p>Nan returned to sit beside him. ‚ÄìIsn‚Äôt that R√©ti?</p>
<p>The camera returned to the physicist facing an interviewer. Quine remembered. Though emeritus director, R√©ti was rarely at the Labs; the office he kept there served him solely as a clubroom or a set. Six months ago a film [pg231] crew had come to the Labs. He had heard R√©ti shouting behind the closed door.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWatch, this is what Highet calls the liberal bias of the media, said Quine as the camera went to the interviewer.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMany of your colleagues turned away from weapons design for ethical reasons. Some of them, your schoolmates, your collaborators, have won Nobel Prizes. Do you ever feel that your work with weapons has cost you credibility or respect within the scientific community? Has it compromised you as a scientist?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNever.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre closely connected to Radiance. What about recent charges that test results have been faked?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is a lie. First, I am not closely connected‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve lobbied extensively for the system in Washington.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI am no lobbyist! I am a private citizen with some scientific expertise, and when I am asked to testify about technical matters I do so‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut for over forty years you‚Äôve been an advocate of nuclear weapons, your authority and influence are well known.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou listen to me. It is an imperfect world, a dangerous world, even an evil world. All ends, even the best, are reached by impure means. Reason is supposed to be the hallmark of science, but no one is swayed by reason. A theory, an idea, does not make its own way. It was Einstein who said merit alone is very little good; it must be backed by tact and knowledge of the world. I know of many cases, maybe the data does not quite agree with your theory, no, the carpers will question, your case is clearer if you discard <em>this</em> set of data, if you report only <em>these</em> results. And who are these frauds? Ptolemy. Galileo. Newton. Bernoulli, Mendel, Millikan. What matters in the long run is not your scruples, but whether you have driven your knowledge home!</p>
<p>A man has no wealth nor power but his knowledge, R√©ti had once said to Quine. But now he said that if power did not lead, knowledge could not follow. Quine saw behind the fury in R√©ti‚Äôs eyes a bright and open wound: more illustrious for his influence than his work, R√©ti had failed at everything but success. And Quine‚Äôs life, he suddenly saw, was bent to R√©ti‚Äôs influence. Quine stood up, ignoring ‚ÄìPhilip what is it? and went to the bathroom. He clutched the sides of the sink, heart racing. In the cabinet he found the pill bottle.</p>
<p><em>The spirit is radiant, yet there are two principles of radiance: that of light, and that of fire. Fire comes to the use of those who go not the way of light. And the difference is, that fire must consume its object.</em></p>
<p>Quine swallowed the pills and his nausea subside as he returned and [pg232] sat, to R√©ti‚Äôs angry voice, ‚ÄìSo I have no Nobel Prize, that accolade of <em>pure</em> science. But Alfred Nobel would understand me well. Yes, I have the ear of presidents. And history will be my judge, not you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat is it? What‚Äôs the matter?</p>
<p>Quine turned to Nan, her face in the phosphor light bleak as a rock outcrop. He reached to touch her neck. Unsmiling she leaned against his hand. His fingers cupped her nape and he drew her mouth to his.</p>
<p>In the bedroom they undressed on opposite sides of the bed. The television droned on. Between her legs he felt the string of a tampon, and as he touched it she bent double and enclosed him in her mouth. Above the activities of their bodies his spirit hovered sadly regarding the terrain of his life. Lightly his hands cradled her head. He began to pump semen. Deep inside him a talon drove home and brought forth, impaled, his soul, writhing. A minute later he was awash in sleep. Waiting at a counter to pick up xeroxes. Quick tap at his shoulder. Kate. She smiled, her eyes upon him, and he knew it was a dream, and he was happy, and he slept.</p>

<section id="section-1" class="level3">
<h3>2</h3>
<p>The morning sky, pallid with haze, conveyed yet enough sun to cast through his high window a faint rhombus which crept along the wall toward the doorway relentless as a horologe. Quine gazed at it half hearing the radio, ‚Äìildfires in three counties, when his phone rang.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs this Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, who‚Äôs this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn. From the demo yesterday?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh yes. How did you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI behaved badly. I‚Äôd like to apologize. Are you free for coffee?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, not this morning, I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìLater this afternoon?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can get off work at four. Do you know the Caf√© Desaparecidos? In the central mall. I work near there, I don‚Äôt have a car.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure I, okay, I‚Äôll see you there about four.</p>
<p>As he hung up Jef Thorpe knocked on his open door. Black jacket, blue shirt, jeans. A faint pock where yesterday the nose stud had been.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCome in.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI guess we‚Äôll be working together.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre staying.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNever a question of that. Listen, that meeting yesterday, I didn‚Äôt belong there, I‚Äôm sorry if‚Ä¶ [pg233]</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot your fault. As you see, Dr.¬†Highet has his way of doing things.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah. Before we start I want to tell you, the single-photon experiment you did with Sorokin was really elegant. I was surprised to find you here, I thought you‚Äôd be somewhere more theoretical.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI thought everyone had forgotten that experiment by now.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh no. It was very sweet work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe detector was critical. We worked on it for two years and couldn‚Äôt get the resolution we needed. We got it only after I came here, they could mill the beryllium to micrometer tolerances.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou didn‚Äôt follow it up.</p>
<p>Sorokin had said, you don‚Äôt leave an infant like this to fend for itself. But Sorokin had always been inflexible. He had refused even to visit the Labs during the experiment.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSorokin thought I was wrong to come here. He said it would be a black hole. He may have been right. Of course things look different from inside.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBlack hole, yeah, I‚Äôve thought of that. But you know where I come from. That limits my options in the straight academic world.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt have any qualms about defense work?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs this, a background check?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I just, you might want to consider your position while you can. I came in neutral about defense work, and before long I was in the thick of it. It‚Äôs especially easy to slip into it from nuclear science.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll keep that in mind. I‚Äôm kind of apolitical.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet me show you what I have, turning to the computer which glowed with:</p>

<p>‚ÄìLooks like we‚Äôre real, said Thorpe.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre lucky. It was years before I was directly associated with a shot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs that luck? [pg234]</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a bit of prestige. A merit badge.</p>
<p>Quine cleared the screen and brought up the Radiance test data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou see. Intense brightness here, and here. Very erratic pattern. Agrees with the theory to a point, but when we increase power, we don‚Äôt get the expected increase in beam, we get less in fact. We‚Äôve talked about trying different metals in the rods, we‚Äôve used gold till now, but mercury‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, elements seventy-two through ninety-five would be good to try but with our time constraints I checked with Fabrication, they have gold rods ready to go, maybe we should stick with those and put our efforts into sensor configuration, keep it simple, don‚Äôt you think?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSounds reasonable.</p>
<p>Thorpe continued to stare at the screen. ‚ÄìCould this be an annulus? This pattern I mean, could the sensors be picking up an imperfect focus, the edge of a ring? If we move them in‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve tried, no luck.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I look at your focusing code?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, sure, all the files are in this directory.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs great. Mind if I work here? pointing to Null‚Äôs desk.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, sure. Sure, go ahead. I‚Äôm going for lunch and maybe a swim. I‚Äôll see you later.</p>
<p><em>We read of the beaver that when it is pursued, knowing it is for the medicinal virtue of its testicles and not being able to escape, it stops; and it bites off its testicles with its sharp teeth and leaves them to its enemies.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Gaunt, saturnine, Bran Nolan in a corner of the cafeteria looked up unsmiling from scattered papers to raise a hand in greeting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow‚Äôs our new boyo Kihara?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell enough. Weren‚Äôt you in line for that position?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs my Tourette‚Äôs syndrome. Terrible liability in a press officer, you never know what he might blurt out in public.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSeems you should have been asked.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know, I‚Äôm happier, if that‚Äôs the word I want, where I am. Kihara is a little lamb, a kid. The last man, Vessell, didn‚Äôt outlast Slater. And we‚Äôre not through with all that, no indeed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGetting some work done? Quine indicated the papers.</p>
<p>‚Äì‚ÄúThe Labs have a longstanding commitment to developing new methods and technologies to protect the environment‚Äù, the most effective of which to date has been the press release. Do you know we have a toxics mitigation program now. Seems some chemical seeped into the ground water under a vineyard off the north boundary. Vines died, soil went gray, [pg235] the whole field stinks like sepsis. I‚Äôm writing an upbeat report about it. And yourself? How‚Äôs the death ray coming?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can maim small insects at a meter. The new concept is interceptors. Small flying rocks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know, da Vinci invented shrapnel. He‚Äôd have been right at home here with all these advanced minds.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs Highet‚Äôs conceit.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThrowing rocks at things. We should be proud, thinking about these old impulses in such an advanced way. years ago R√©ti had some hare-brained flying rock scheme, these things never die, just get recyc</p>
<p>‚ÄìBran, Bran, Bran. What must I do to get you to use a font other than Courier? Nolan pulled back from the sheaf of papers brandished in one plump hand beneath his nose.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBob, how‚Äôs the gout? I don‚Äôt like this business of tarting up manuscripts. You get enchanted by the beauty of it all. You start to think you‚Äôre writing the Book of Kells.</p>
<p>‚ÄìA few attractive fonts, tastefully applied, can spice up a presentation so. A little humanitas, you know. Why else, Bran, did we get you that powerful and costly workstation?</p>
<p>‚ÄìJeez, Bob, I don‚Äôt know, why did you? I‚Äôm still figuring out the type balls on my Selectric.</p>
<p>The sheaf of papers fell fanning from their clip onto the table. Shaking his head and chuckling grimly, Bob withdrew.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHumanitas, yes, that‚Äôs what we need, isn‚Äôt it, Highet with his Renaissance, and Aldus Manutius there, need a few more particle men who‚Äôve read the Tao Te Ching, couple more managers who‚Äôve studied Sun Tzu, lend these binary views a little tone, dress up the winners and losers, the Elect and the Preterite, the screwers and the screwed, each man in his station. Keep your distance from the Preterite, can‚Äôt have just anyone winning, because if you let the rabble win, if they can rise, you can surely fall.</p>
<p>Nolan folded back pages, ‚ÄìListen to this lovely bit, ‚Äúthe support of this tight-knit community‚Äù, support is it now? I‚Äôd have said the goading, the ambition, the <em>Schadenfreude</em>, that‚Äôs what gets the work done. Look around you, these are people without lives, the wife walked out six months ago with the kid, they‚Äôre eating Campbell‚Äôs soup cold out of the can, they haven‚Äôt got a clean shirt, but after a few months of eighteen-hour days they‚Äôve got <em>data</em> that everyone wants to see. They <em>win big</em>.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBran, you keep working here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat should I do then, write novels? Or maybe journalism, that‚Äôs it, <em>investigative</em> journalism. Have you met the journalist from Cambridge? Right over there with his tape recorder, name‚Äôs Andrew Steradian. He‚Äôs [pg236] researching the belief systems of those who work on weapons of mass destruction, I think was his phrase. Quite the charmer. He‚Äôs published one book on scientific fraud and a paper highly critical of what he calls the defense establishment. You probably don‚Äôt watch TV but there was an antinuclear program on PBS last night, Steradian was in it abusing R√©ti.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoes Highet know all this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet invited him.</p>
<p>Quine headed for the door, passing as he did Andrew Steradian, holding a small microphone before a J Section technician, saying, ‚Äìyou‚Äôre so goldang busy every day you just put off thinking about it, though in Quine‚Äôs view pressure was a tool well used to put off thinking.</p>
<hr />
<p>Black cottonwoods around the pool throve despite the drought. Catkins littered the water. A jet moved in the sky, stitching a contrail across the thin lace of cloud drifting eastward through which a hot sun struggled to assert itself. Quine sat on a towel on the grassy verge and watched a portly bearded swimsuited man enter through the gate, barrel chest glossed with sunbleached hair, and behind him a woman in a white halter top and shorts, the heads of three men turning to follow. The pool was crowded this Friday afternoon; unlike Quine, most worked a five-day week, most would depart hence into a forgetfulness. In the shallows of the pool two young girls splashed. One opened her mouth to show her companion a bright penny on her outstretched tongue. A young mother in a black maillot gripped a ladder to raise herself half from the pool and wave at her infant in a nearby stroller, glisten and shadow in the cords of her back, and Quine suffered a pang for a life now beyond his knowing: to be wed, with child, so young. On thermals a blackwinged bird, <em>Cathartes aura</em>, rocked and banked. Jet‚Äôs thunder fell like muffled blows. The warmth and the sound of water churned by swimmers and the spray tossed up by their passing lulled Quine into a lethargy from which he woke with a start to consult his watch. On the pool‚Äôs floor danced cusps of light.</p>
<hr />
<p>When he parked at the town‚Äôs central mall the high cloud had passed and the sky was pale blue overhead and scum brown near its horizons. Quine walked sweating between pastel columns under a pediment that alluded to no place or time between smoked glass doors into an atrium so chill and disjunct it might have been another planet. Outside methane and ammonia storms might blow. Shops, granite benches, low fountains, and climbing plants ringed a pool in which stood a steel sculpture of crippled symmetry, as if a Platonic solid had ruptured.</p>
<p>The cafe‚Äôs high walls rose past exposed beams and ducts to the nacre of frosted skylights. Lynn sat at a glass table in a wireframe chair, face downcast [pg237] at papers before her. In the moment before she looked up, Kate‚Äôs face glowed before him. In this cafe they‚Äôd first talked. What do you do, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHoy es el d√≠a de los muertos, Lynn said in greeting, banishing Kate‚Äôs image. Angularities all her own moved in her flesh; a small gap showed between her teeth as she smiled.</p>
<p>Quine seated himself and said gravely, ‚ÄìI should tell you I‚Äôm involved with someone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìJesus, I said I wanted to apologize, not start an affair.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI, sorry I‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd maybe pick your brain about Radiance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry, what did you say? El d√≠a‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe Day of the Dead. All Saints‚Äô Day. All this used to be Mexico, you know, they called it Aztlan. Once my law firm shuts you people down, we‚Äôre going to reclaim all of Aztlan for the native peoples. Don‚Äôt look that way, I‚Äôm joking, that‚Äôs the kind of thing the far right says about us.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre a lawyer?</p>
<p>‚ÄìParalegal.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs that you‚Äôre reading?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour press releases. She held a sheaf set in unadorned Courier font. ‚ÄìGod you people have fingers in a lot of pies. When I started my concern was the bombs, but now I find out about the supercomputers, the lasers, the genetics, the chemicals, it‚Äôs a separate world in there, isn‚Äôt it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou probably know more about it than I do.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour cover stories are so creative. Every one of. Oh, go ahead, order, she‚Äôs waiting.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCappuccino. What do you mean, cover stories?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll have an espresso, please. Every one of these quote benign technologies has a pretty easy-to-imagine military use. Laser X-ray lithography for etching microchips, uh huh, and here‚Äôs one about kinder gentler CBW, ‚Äúless virulent‚Äù tear gas for ‚Äúcrowd control‚Äù, heavier specific gravity for controlled delivery, if this is the stuff you‚Äôre public about one can only imagine the rest.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre wrong, there‚Äôs a genuine effort to convert to peacef</p>
<p>‚ÄìDual use, I know all about it. Genuine effort to blur the line is what it is, and it goes beyond the Labs, people in physics and comp sci departments across the country lining up at the same trough, the grants are there and if they don‚Äôt take the money someone else will. What a waste of resources.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs more complicated. I won‚Äôt defend it, but the people I work with, they‚Äôre not cynical, not</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, I know how people get caught up in their work. I have a friend there, not in Radiance, in another section. He‚Äôs a Quaker, he calls it ‚Äúbeing [pg238] in the world‚Äù. I can respect that, at least he‚Äôs thought about it. How did you get into it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm well, a lapsed theorist. But I‚Äôm not typical‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Was he not? R√©ti, Highet, Dietz, Thorpe, all had failed in some subtle way that in such a place could be denied. But where was there not failure and denial?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo your people pay any attention at all to our demonstrations?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn J Section? Not much.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe seem to get to your boss, at least.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean Highet?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIn his little red sports car. What about you? What did you think about yesterday‚Äôs?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt seemed, I don‚Äôt know, festive, almost a costume party, I didn‚Äôt realize at first it was Halloween‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt was a ceremony. An exorcism.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh come on, what, you mean we‚Äôre possessed</p>
<p>‚ÄìBy arrogance if nothing else.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs absurd, you can‚Äôt convince anyone with supersti</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs no different from your rituals, your bomb tests, just as absurd and ritualistic, but really dangerous!</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot my tests, and he remembered <em>Dietz, Quine, sup.</em> ‚ÄìI‚Äôm no good talking about this.</p>
<p>The set of her features, so poised and eager, softened and her voice lowered. ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt mean to attack you. I‚Äôm sure you</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I‚Äôm not sure! Because what if it is a waste, the billions and decades and lives and talents, then it‚Äôs not just me, not just my mistake, but something wrong at the root‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf it is a mistake, you can face it, call a stop.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut there‚Äôs never any stopping. It‚Äôs almost as if these things we work on‚Ä¶ they use us to get born. Could use anyone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry Philip‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo it‚Äôs not your fault. I just, I need to get back. Her face was so concerned that he almost cried out with self-pity. He abruptly rose and walked away stolid with loathing of his own erratic heart, and of her for stirring it.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the night he woke sweating with a pulse of ninety, reached for the pill-bottle next to the small box DREAMLIGHT Unlock Your Inner Potential and its plastic headset. The pills opened a plain of timelessness and haze in which it seemed a lost part of himself dwelled. All then was fine. As he lay gazing at the grainy darkness of the ceiling his fluency returned, wonderful problems enticed and yielded to his insight, wisdom depended from the sky [pg239] like fruit. As he began to drowse he roused himself to attach the headset like a blindfold around his temples. When he dreamed, a red strobe in the headset, sensing his eye movements, flickered and roused him enough to observe but not to wake.</p>
<p>The battle station shines in the void of space. Arms pivot as targets rise in swarms, bright points on the black hollow of a crescent Earth. They blur in a silver mist of chaff. Above the crescent distant stations ignite in globes of light and their beams lance out, too many to destroy, and the dream begins again with different stations, Mylar skin of mirrors rippling, missiles coming on as earth-based beams strike up and the mirrors twitch to focus‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The world has changed, the enemy has collapsed into ruined republics. Yet despite this consummation of all the Labs has worked for, the work goes on unabated, the mood is spiritless, the shots in the desert continue, as though it is some ritual of penance, some black and endless propitiation of forces that by losing their fixed abode have gained in menace. Now effort must redouble to keep those forces from finding a new abode, from tenanting, aye, the Labs.</p>
<p>Vertigo of waking. Tearing of Velcro as the headset falls free. Wan dawn light. Stillness, faint whistle of tinnitus, first sounds of birdcall. And he realizes this dream is true. The enemy is gone. And the work does go on, and on.</p>

<p>In the next days Lynn was not among the protesters. Their numbers had diminished to a small group in daily vigil by the main gate holding a drooping sheet painted DIABOLIS EX MACHINA. Quine in his machine slowed through the gate and stopped, valves in the engine ticking, for a backhoe lurching across the main road to a dirt track that wound behind a building, and closed his window against the dust billowing toward him as he went on past an air hammer chiseling a sidewalk to rubble, overtones of its chatter following him across the rock moat and into the building where, too late to retreat, he saw Thorpe seated at Null‚Äôs computer tapping rapidly without letup at Quine‚Äôs entrance.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMorning, said Quine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIs it still? I‚Äôve been here all night. Something there for you to read.</p>
<p>Atop Quine‚Äôs stack of journals, a year‚Äôs unread accumulation, colored slips in their pages flagging articles that at an earlier time would not have waited a day, was a xerox topped with a yellow sticker SEEN THIS? <em>Physical Review Letters 1954</em>. A joke? A dig at his age? [pg240]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know it‚Äôs old, said Thorpe. ‚ÄìBut I think it applies. See, I started with an EE from a hick school, taught myself quantum mechanics by reading Dirac, things don‚Äôt change that much. Lots of ideas have been left hanging. That‚Äôs how I, I mean, stumbling in embarrassment at having carelessly touched as he thought Quine‚Äôs sensitive point, ‚Äìnot to say, it‚Äôs just if you‚Äôre a student like me, not well connected, not seeing the latest preprints and hearing all the gossip, you need another way up. This is my way, looking for old forgotten stuff to build on.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo tell me about this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI came across it working for Fish and Himmelhoch, looking for a nuclear model to explain the cold fusion reaction. Okay I know, the current wisdom is, there‚Äôs no reaction, it‚Äôs bogus, or if anything is happening it‚Äôs electrochemical, fine. But you can model the process in a nuclear way, the phenomenon‚Äôs called superradiance. The equations are quite similar. Highet saw the connection.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTo this? Highet told you about Superbright?</p>
<p>‚ÄìVery sharp guy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs quite a breach of classification.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe kind of hinted around, citing the open literature. Anyway it‚Äôs moot, I‚Äôm cleared now. What do you think?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll read it when I get a chance, dropping it back atop the stack of journals.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut, I mean, we don‚Äôt have much time. Should I pursue it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat have you been doing?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, here, let me show you, I started modifying your code but I had a couple of quest</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôve changed my files?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no I made copies, all changes made to my copies and I was just wondering about a few things like here where you‚Äôve got this array of reals here, what‚Äôs that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the rod array, angles lengths diameters densities</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, because see I was thinking if you make that something like ten to the minus ten here</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs the thickness, we can‚Äôt make rods that thin it‚Äôs imposs</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut if we play what-if with these numbers‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWait what are you</p>
<p>‚Äìthen the beam, oop that‚Äôs a little extreme but you see what I</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut there‚Äôs no, I mean sure, you can make the model do anything, but it has to correspond to reality!</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm just getting the feel of the system. But, oh here I wanted to know what this function does, this hyperbol</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes that‚Äôs the response curve of the sensors we‚Äôre using, it‚Ä¶ look, [pg241] can this wait? and without pausing Quine was out of the office as from speakers overhead a pleasant female voice advised, ‚ÄìAttention all personnel. Starting at midnight, tiger teams will conduct exercises in this area using blank ammunition, and he turned into the restroom where at the far end, past a row of sinks and urinals opposite metal stalls, a gym bag hung on a hook with a towel and steam billowed forth in a pelting rush of noise and Quine, elbows braced on a basin, looked up sharply from the laving of his hands at a bass voice echoing against the hard tile, ‚Äì<em>bist du ein Thor und rein</em>, to see in the mirror but not his own eternally surprised features but fogged void, turning from the hiss of his faucet to glimpse through dispersing mist a hard white nude male body emerging to towel itself still singing, ‚Äì<em>welch Wissen dir auch mag beschieden sein</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the cavernous building where Dietz supervised, Quine watched long metal tubes welded one by one to the great monstrance in which the bomb, a quarter mile underground, would rest. From sensors at the ends of each tube hundreds of cables would run to the surface. Dietz displayed a blueprint of the cylinder.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe are already welding. I cannot wait to know.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan you hold off a day or two? If I had any idea where to put the damn things I‚Äôd tell you if I had any idea even how to find what I‚Äôm looking for‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìAll right, we can go ahead with other things for just a little while. Now the rod configuration‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìUnchanged. I‚Äôm not touching that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMake sure, please, that Highet knows all this. Sometimes he wanders through here and if things are not what he expects he is most unpleasant.</p>
<p>Outside Highet‚Äôs office Quine, arm raised to knock, from within heard Highet‚Äôs insistent rasp, ‚Äìlike Kammerer, you know, it‚Äôs not who makes the mistake it‚Äôs who takes the blame, and at Thorpe‚Äôs voice barely audible, ‚Äìsorry for the poor son of a bitch stuck in his position at his age, barely shows his face, and Highet, ‚Äìnever passed a design review, Quine‚Äôs ears flared with heat, the door before him turning flat and insubstantial as he lowered his hand and proceeded down the hall unseeing, guided by a familiarity more the prisoner‚Äôs than the adept‚Äôs around a corner to a water fountain, studying a bulletin board and its overlapping notices O Section, programmer needed to model underground plumes, K Section, LASS expert needed, Z Section, multimedia guru, B Section, materials engineer, while two young men passed, one saying, ‚ÄìI have no special loyalty to OOP, and on to a further junction where a convex mirror above him presented an anamorphic view around the corner. There Nan emerged from a cross corridor with a wiry black-haired man in a blue knit shirt, his biceps [pg242] and forearms hard and tanned. The two spoke briefly. The man put a hand on Nan‚Äôs neck and bent forward to kiss her mouth. Quine turned back the way he had come, slowing only when he found he had nearly circled the building. He backtracked to Highet‚Äôs door and entered without knocking. Highet was alone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGet Thorpe out of my office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs your problem now, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs so important give him his own space, I don‚Äôt want him hanging around me.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThought you‚Äôd appreciate the company, thought he might be useful to you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThorpe handles himself well, you could learn from him. Show some team spirit. Poor boy‚Äôs feeling abandoned by you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll work with him, but I don‚Äôt have to like him or share office space with him. It‚Äôs bad enough Null‚Äôs stuff is still there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThorpe has his own space. You want him out, you tell him so. By the way, R√©ti‚Äôs here for a visit, you might want to pay your respects. Instead of running around down in Fabrication with Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSomeone has to tend to those details.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLet me tell you something, Philip, I‚Äôm a smart guy but to be brutally honest I‚Äôm a second-rate physicist. I have the ideas but not the persistence, I‚Äôve known that for twenty years. But I have learned to position myself and to use other people to get what I want. Win win, you know, we help each other look good.</p>
<p>Voices approached in the corridor as Highet went on in a lower tone, ‚ÄìOne path in the world is up. There‚Äôs also a path down. What there isn‚Äôt is standing still. Now you, friend, have been standing still for quite a little while. I‚Äôd say you need to make some career decisions soon, before they‚Äôre made for you.</p>
<p>Flanked by two Lab factotums, Horatiu R√©ti came slowly, stamping his cane, into Highet‚Äôs office. His eyes, azure behind thick lenses, peered without recognition as Quine greeted him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, my young friend, how are you?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou remember Philip Quine, Horatiu. That beautifully sweet photon detector he built for us.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOf course, of course.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo here we are, three generations of first-rate physics talent.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes yes, the torch is passed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI really must be</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, stay. Horatiu, Philip‚Äôs going to get us the data we need to silence the critics. [pg243]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe critics, there is no need to mind them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrom your eminence perhaps not, but I have to deal with these fools and dupes almost daily. Do you know what a senator, a United States senator, said to me the other day? He calls this place a scientific brothel.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know the man you mean. Brothels I am sure he knows well, but of science he is ignorant.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell unfortunately this ignoramus chairs a committee that oversees our funding, so I have to deal with him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSpeaking of influence, this left-wing journalist, I see him here again, why do you let him in? Six months ago he abused my trust with gutter tactics of the worst sort.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou mean Steradian? He‚Äôs a useful idiot. He‚Äôs so cocksure I let him hear things I want to see in print, look here‚Ä¶ Highet lifted from the desktop a folded newspaper, ‚Äì‚ÄúRadiance Research Forges Ahead‚Äù, see, this is solid gold. He‚Äôs so excited when he hears something that may be classified, his critical sense shuts off. You can see him quiver like a puppy dog from the excitement.</p>
<p>‚ÄìKeep him away from me, I want nothing to do with him. What is our testing status?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe need more. As always. Classifying them has helped deflect criticism but we‚Äôre still being nickel and dimed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you need?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAn additional three hundred million over the next year.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI will talk to the President. This is for Superbright?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes. We can definitely show quantitative agreement with theory. It‚Äôs only a matter of time and money.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat isn‚Äôt?</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcuse me, Leo about that agreement we‚Äôre</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip will tell you how close we are. He and his new assistant have made tremendous headway, just tremendous.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo? Tell me about this, my young friend.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, I think it‚Äôs premature to say so. There‚Äôs a shot next Friday. We‚Äôll know better than.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip‚Äôs too modest, that‚Äôs always been his problem.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I just think we need a lot more</p>
<p>‚ÄìMore funding. Basically it‚Äôs a matter of funding. In the long run we see coherent beams striking out a thousand miles and diverging no more than a meter. We see a single battle station downing every missile any enemy can launch.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat is excellent, I can tell the Preside</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut [pg244]</p>
<p>‚ÄìHoratiu, we‚Äôre also going ahead with your interceptors. As part of the overall system.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBaldur?</p>
<p>‚ÄìSmaller, faster, smarter, cheaper. Less than thirty billion to deploy. That‚Äôs dirt cheap.</p>
<p>‚ÄìEven twenty years ago I thought that this idea only needed the technology to catch up. It is good we have a history, a tradition, a culture here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLike Ulysses, we‚Äôre never at a loss.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, is that so, never at a</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip</p>
<p>‚Äìunless we‚Äôre trying to produce a thousand mile beam where no test has ever shown</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell how long do you think we can keep it up! this this</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs long as it takes.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you, Dr.¬†R√©ti?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy young friend, I am an optimist.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, I want a word. Excuse us Horatiu. One arm clutched Quine in tight embrace and steered them into the hallway, Highet saying in low controlled tones, ‚ÄìOne day soon, very soon, I‚Äôll stop giving you second chances. Come up empty this time and you‚Äôre through. Clear?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMeaning what? You‚Äôll what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know but it will be terrible and final and I promise you‚Äôll never forget it. Highet raised his voice to hearty amiability, ‚ÄìGood man! You let me know, and went back into his office.</p>
<hr />
<p>With the darkening of the sky the life of the building went to X Section, the Playpen, where the younger men worked on schemes even more speculative than Superbright, and Quine returned for the thousandth time to theory with the sinking heart of a man returning to a loveless home. Entrapment. As if fine wire had threaded his drugged veins, and now, as feeling returned, any movement might tear him open. He fidgeted the radio on to, ‚Äìfades to a reddish color as it enters the Earth‚Äôs shad, and off as he saw again the tilt of Nan‚Äôs head, the man‚Äôs hand cupping her neck. The ridge of her collarbone, the warm pulse of the vein across it.</p>
<p>On Null‚Äôs whiteboard deltas sigmas omegas integrals infinities in variegated ink still wove like fundamental forces their elegant pattern around a void. From the clutter on the desk he lifted CENTURY 21 LABS QUARTERLY. Changing world betokens larger role for science. Acceptable levels of social risk. Public does not fully understand. World free of threats too much to ask. Revolutionary new technique. Major improvement. Important to a variety of national goals. Unique multidisciplinary expertise. Two [pg245] young men, one poised to hurl something, caromed past his doorway. He shut the door on guffaws and ‚Äìteach you some hydrodynamics!</p>
<p>Paper atop his stack, 1954, by Black. He turned to the citations, then read from the start, stopping often to reread with a doggedness that made shift for his halt sense, once so fine, of the rhythms of thought and confirmation, their probe and test and parry and clinch that now required his slow and remedial attention to be seized. As he read, his respect for Thorpe grew even as an emptiness opened within him. When he was finished he stared into space before reaching across the desk to snap off the lights.</p>
<p>The phone chattered. On the second ring he lifted it, holding silence to ear for a moment before speaking. In the darkness the computer screen, phosphors charged by the room‚Äôs vanished light, was a dim fading square.</p>
<p>‚ÄìQuine.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHi, it‚Äôs Lynn. I‚Äôm hiking up Mount Ohlone with some friends tonight, want to come?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know it‚Äôs short notice.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo I mean sure, why not.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood! Meet us at the park gate about nine. It‚Äôs ten miles north on Crow Canyon Road.</p>
<p>In the hallway a length of surgical tubing, knotted at both ends, lay ruptured and limp in a film of water. As he left the building sprinklers came on in a silver mist and rainbows shimmered in the floodlit air. He drove out past parked vehicles and armed men in fatigues.</p>
<p>He was early. The sky was starry. Seldom was he this far from the valley‚Äôs lights. Orion, Taurus, Canis Major. Eyes reaching into interstellar void. Where in this blackness is the seed of love? of meaning? Or is corruption inherent in Being itself, wrong at the root?</p>
<p>A car approached, lights snagging in the trees, then came around the last bend lightless, and rolled to a stop.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMark, Jackie, this is Philip. Why‚Äôre we whispering?</p>
<p>‚ÄìPark‚Äôs closed.</p>
<p>They went round the closed gate and past a building set back among trees. In a second-story window a dim line flickered, a fluorescent tube not on nor off, stuttering between states. Fifty yards farther they left the road for a broad path that rose winding under black oak, then bay. An owl called.</p>
<p>Ahead Jackie laughed and touched Mark‚Äôs arm, not a lover‚Äôs touch, but a gesture of intimacy with the world, the same hand caressing air and underbrush. They talked softly about the people they knew, hes and shes darting in and out of audibility like moths in the dark. Next to him Lynn pulled at [pg246] a low branch. Leaves popped free and she crushed them under Quine‚Äôs nose, carrying to him a strong waft of mint and resin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSweet bay, she said, ‚Äìis sacred to Apollo, but this is not European bay, <em>laurens</em>, it‚Äôs California bay, <em>umbellularia</em>. Her tongue lingered on the liquids.</p>
<p>They climbed until they broke from the woods onto an open slope. A path through long dry grass led to another dark grove. The moon, not yet risen, rinsed palely the eastern sky. The valley to the south was filled with glittering points. At its verge was the floodlit terrain of the Labs.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd this is <em>Artemisia tridentata</em>, Lynn said, inhaling as she broke from a sagebrush a twig of gray leaves. ‚ÄìSmell it. I wonder what god loves this.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow do you know all this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is where I grew up. This is the smell of my home. This is how I know I belong.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook! Jackie called, ‚Äìa green star! Is that a planet? and finding the pale disk straight up in the Ra, a handbreath from Mars near the Sisters, Quine knew it was no star, but the beam of a laser ten miles south stabbing sixty miles to the edge of space where sodium atoms glowed in its heat, and he said to Lynn, ‚Äìnot a planet, but some miracle of strange device, and she laughed before dropping the pungent twig and running to the next grove, and he ran after, the path dipping as seductively as the sweet hollow at the base of the spine, until he tripped and went sprawling, heart thudding, hackles alive. What was he outrunning? A presence, almost, was in the grove. He feared it though it was benign. It was not death, but it would change his life if he allowed it.</p>
<p>Three figures stood before him laughing. ‚ÄìYou okay? and a flash of shame, not for his fall but for the falseness of his position before these children. The errors of his life were irrevocably; as yet theirs were not. He had wanted to borrow the grave of their youth, that was the shame. Mark held out his hand. Quine grasped it and was pulled to his feet and followed them out of the grove.</p>
<p>Jackie opened a backpack and brought out bread, cheese, fruit, a plastic bottle of water. On the grass they sat eating. The ridgeline was hard black against the sky and pieces of the rising moon glinted in the trees.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou from around here, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìFrom the East. Isn‚Äôt everyone? I‚Äôve been here five years.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPractically a native. What do you do?</p>
<p>‚ÄìComputers. I write software for Taliesin Systems.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFriend of mine worked for CodeWin, maybe you know him.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs a big industry.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGetting bigger by the day, said Lynn dryly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAh, look, look at the moon. It cleared the ridge, swollen, no goddess [pg247] remontant but an airless world already mapped, trodden, and projected for division into satrapies of mining, manufacturing, and defense, occupancy lapsed only until those scenarios could enrich their planners at a margin of return greater and more reliable than what current technology assured.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre contracting with an aerospace company, Quine went on, to control low-orbit balloons a couple of miles across, apparent size of the moon, sunlit, carrying messages.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMessages?</p>
<p>‚ÄìCommercial messages, logos. Advertising.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut that‚Äôs, Jackie began and Mark cut in, ‚ÄìDidn‚Äôt I read about this, the Sierra Club‚Äôs bringing suit‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe so, we‚Äôre just the contractors, I don‚Äôt really know, and Jackie glancing at Lynn seemed to lose interest, resuming with Mark in a low voice their conversation of hes and shes while Lynn walked away, obliging Quine to follow at a distance, leaving behind ‚Äìshe doesn‚Äôt see you as a friend she sees you as more and that‚Äôs scary, to overtake her on a knoll where she faced the valley lights with crossed arms.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, these are my friends. Don‚Äôt lie to them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI was trying it on. That‚Äôs a Lab phrase. You don‚Äôt like me as a software mogul?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou do this a lot? Jerk people around?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ look it‚Äôs just a bad habit. Defensive. Sometimes you have to, there, to advance your goals, lying‚Äôs almost a game, see if the other guy‚Äôs smart enough to catch it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd Mark wasn‚Äôt smart enough for you. You take his good faith for foolishness.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm trying to understand you. You repay friendship with falsehood?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening there, what I‚Äôm up against right now‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìTell me, then.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey really have their hooks in you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI know that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan‚Äôt you quit?</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd do what! Turn from the one place where my, my talents have meaning, from everything that defines me?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat do you want, Philip?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWant? I want five years back. Before them I was a scientist.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey haven‚Äôt robbed you of that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, that‚Äôs so, I gave myself over, and now I‚Äôm on the line for something I don‚Äôt care about. That‚Äôs the way, yes, you‚Äôre going to get screwed [pg248] regardless, so you should make sure it‚Äôs for something that matters to you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut you, I don‚Äôt believe this, you don‚Äôt engage with people, you stand off, you get angry and defensive when they think they don‚Äôt approve, and then you think you‚Äôre screwed?</p>
<p>‚ÄìLynn‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt know what to say, I really don‚Äôt. I understand if you‚Äôre bitter, but not flaunting it, this almost pride in it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìPride! ‚Ä¶I have an insoluble problem, data that‚Äôs no good fraudulent predictions a Congressional visit next week a few days to vindicate what isn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm talking a walk in the moonlight because I don‚Äôt know what to do! Not pride that‚Äôs desperation‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs that bad? Face hidden in moonshadow, she stepped toward him. His need to be touched and take comfort welled up, but some structure unknown yet dreadful held him still. After a moment‚Äôs wait she stepped back.</p>
<p>They returned to where Jackie was packing the picnic, still talking to Mark, ‚Äìso I‚Äôm going wait, stop, this is it, these are the boundaries and he‚Äôs like, what did I do? She handed the pack to Lynn, ‚Äìtake this? and embraced Mark from Behind, her whiteclad arms around his chest, straps of her shortlegged overalls a dark X on her back, bare calves duckwalking the pair down the slope.</p>
<p>In the lot Lynn said to Jackie, ‚ÄìGet a ride with you guys?</p>
<p>Quine called out, ‚ÄìMark, just joking about the balloon.</p>
<p>Mark looked up, fumbling with his keys, smiling. ‚ÄìOh yeah?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThanks for inviting me. He got in the car, opened the glovebox, found a tablet, felt the excised triangle, brushed lint from it, swallowed it dry.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the apartment was a smell. It was like stale smoke and rotting food, edged with something fouler, like the metallic stench of the bright green flux from the open pipe. At first he thought it came from outside, where earlier they‚Äôd been roofing. But on the deck the air was fresh. He knelt to the carpet and smelled nothing. In the kitchen he bent to the drain and smelled nothing. From a bottle he squeezed a pearl of soap onto a sponge, ran hot water in the sink, scrubbed and rinsed it. He scrubbed the stove top. The ceiling fan was silted over by grease and spiderweb. He fetched a chair and reached to touch it. A black gobbet fell from it to the stove top. He fetched pliers and freed the nuts holding the shield, banging with the handle to break the dried paint around the rim. In both hands he bore the shield like a chalice to the sink.</p>
<p>In its concavities had pooled a glossy tar. He scrubbed it for minutes, [pg249] smutch washing slowly into the sink. Then he spooled off yards of paper toweling, wet and soaped it, and climbed the chair to wash over and again the sleeve of the fan, the blades, the hub. A viscous brown residue clung to the towels and his fingers. Farther into the recess, beyond his reach, was more tar.</p>
<p>Sweat soaked him. He went onto the deck. The moon was dim, its fullness lurid, as if behind smoke. He stared in wonder and fear until the knowledge that it was an eclipse broke upon him banishing fear and wonder alike.</p>
<p>When he went back in the smell was waiting. He understood that from now on everything would smell like this. For a while he sat at the table with his eyes shut, then opened the newspaper for the memory of CARPETS CLEANED but it parted to 24 HRS OUTCALL DAWNA and LOVE talk $2/MIN and he stared bleakly at the sullen pout, circleted forehead, hair as wild as if fresh risen from the sea, under a shiny black cloak linen garb pleated in most subtle fashion. His hand found the telephone, and after a distant chirrup a small insinuating voice flicked like a tongue in his ear, and he stepped sharply back from the uncradled receiver, switched off the lights, leaving the voice breathing unheeded into the darkness and the reddish moonlight pooled on the floor.</p>
<p>He showered. In the stream lust swelled in him like nausea. Joylessly he seized its nexus. Hot spray lashed him. Incoherent images and broken geometries flashed upon him. Runnels nudged moonwhite globs toward the drain. Depleted he toweled. On the sink were Nan‚Äôs toothpaste, hairbrush, lipstick, mascara. On the toilet tank a travel kit of quilted cotton gaped, displaying diaphragm, jelly, tampons, vitamins, ibuprofen, hairpins, barrette, lens wetter, a glass jar of face cream. A towelend snagged the open zipper as Quine scrubbed dry his hair. Items hailed on the tiled floor. He dropped the towel, then swept his hand across the sink top. He grabbed the kit and hurled it. The jar flew out and smashed against the wall.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-3" class="level3">
<h3>4</h3>
<p>Dry sycamore leaves scraped over pavement in a hot wind drawn west from distant desert by a stalled offshore low. Over the ridge east of town dust and the smell of manure from the farmlands and a haze of smoke blew fitfully into the valley. As the sun rose through layers of pollution Quine, driving to the back gate of the Labs so as to avoid the protesters, passed the dead vineyard by the north boundary. He pulled over, stilling the engine and the radio‚Äôs ‚Äìty thousand acres ablaze.</p>
<p>The gate was closed but unlocked under a bright new sign bearing the biohazard trefoil and DANGER TOXICS MITIGATION PILOT SITE ALPHA KEEP [pg250] OUT. The drone of flies rose and fell like a turbine. Inside the gate the flies abated. A stubble of dry vines clung to irrigation uprights. Underfoot a chromegreen film glazed cracked gray silt. Bark from a withered vine sloughed like white ash on his fingers. Then from deep in the vineyard a warm moist flatus perfused the air. A stink like the chyme of a dying beast. he ran back to the car choking and drooling. At a roadside faucet he rinsed his mouth, his face, his hair, his hands, yet the foulness, as of corroded metal, lingered. What god loves this?</p>
<p>At Null‚Äôs desk Thorpe worked.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd Dietz called. He has to know where to put the sensors. Today.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm tempted to leave them where they were in the last shot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe can‚Äôt do that, Highet would</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm tempted.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, he can be a prick can‚Äôt he.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNot if you play by his rules. He always has a carrot handy.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell I have quite a few ideas but you need to look them over, tell me where they‚Äôre out of line, you know we‚Äôre really down to the wire here and</p>
<p>‚ÄìOkay, let‚Äôs assume Black‚Äôs right‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh then you‚Äôve read</p>
<p>‚ÄìAssume we‚Äôre looking at quanta as localized particles guided by a physically real field‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìHighet, you know he really grilled me on this stuff when he came out to Utah, put me through the wringer, made me prove every assumption, but after an hour I had him convinced, and I thought he really respected‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìTypical Highet slap and stroke.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow suppose we‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre good at this. And very fast.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCommercial software you know, those eighteen hour days tone you right up.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDon‚Äôt touch that, we can‚Äôt change the rod array, I‚Äôve already told Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan we reorient it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìMaybe. I‚Äôll check.</p>
<p>Under Thorpe‚Äôs shaping the model gradually began to show correlation. After several hours one run produced an annulus. Then nothing for hours more. They ate dinner in the cafeteria, not speaking, then returned to work. Thorpe coded for an hour, then ran the model. The annulus. He rotated the rods; power jumped and the annulus closed to a point. They stared at the screen. Thorpe bit his thumb. ‚ÄìWhat do you think?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt looks all right. [pg251]</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt <em>looks</em> fantastic. It‚Äôs a hundred times brighter than the last shot‚Äôs data. But the model‚Äôs tweaked to hell and gone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt see anything wrong.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo‚Ä¶ so we would put the sensors here‚Ä¶ see, this is how I work. I‚Äôm not a theorist, I don‚Äôt have your background, I need the machine, to immerse myself in the code, feel the system‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, it‚Äôs a remarkable job. I couldn‚Äôt have done this. I‚Äôve tried for months.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut the thing is, at some level it‚Äôs all just pushing numbers around. I don‚Äôt know if the code is saying anything real.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôll know soon enough.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you think something‚Äôs wrong?</p>
<p>Quine shrugged. ‚ÄìNothing I can see.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre not convinced.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt have to be. It‚Äôs what Highet wants, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah but, that‚Äôs not what you think I‚Äôm doing, is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìBecause I would never do that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sure you</p>
<p>‚ÄìSince Fish and Himmelhoch I have to be very careful. They were crucified, just crucified, they‚Äôre pariahs, their careers are finished. Anything to do with cold fusion is tainted, you may as well say you‚Äôre working on perpetual motion. And I was on that team, I was in that lab.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPerpetual motion, you could probably sell that to Highet. At least as a talking point.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs not funny to me. I had nothing to do with that debacle, just so we‚Äôre clear on that.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSure. I understand.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm touchy. Just tired. You‚Äôve been generous, letting me work with your code and all, I really thought you‚Äôd stick me with the scut work but you‚Äôve done it haven‚Äôt you all the test details and let me do the interesting part. This could take me a long way and I won‚Äôt forget it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you go home, get some sleep?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYeah, I‚Äôm whipped.</p>
<p>‚ÄìTake tomorrow off. I‚Äôll tell Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo no, I‚Äôll be in. We have to make up a work order.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll do it, don‚Äôt worry about it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAre you staying longer?</p>
<p>‚ÄìGod no, what is it, midnight?</p>
<p>‚ÄìTwo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNo, I‚Äôm leaving in five minutes. I‚Äôll write the work order tomorrow. [pg252]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh I meant to, here‚Äôs something else for you to read‚Ä¶ and, hesitating a moment, Thorpe placed a stapled xerox atop Quine‚Äôs stack, held his gaze, and departed.</p>
<p>It was a new paper by Sorokin. At a prestigious school now. Tenured. Quine skimmed it as if reading news from a distant galaxy or remote epoch. It solidified and extended the work they‚Äôd done together, the experiment that had separated them. It was clear that it was a field now and that Sorokin owned it. He stanched the welling of envy and self-pity. Good for Sorokin.</p>
<p>But instead of going home Quine broke apart Thorpe‚Äôs code and studied the changes closely. He gave the model a new set of energies: points clustered around the focus. Again, with different energies, the same focus emerged. Something was wrong, he could smell it; oh yes, his instinct was not yet dead.</p>
<p>Near dawn he found it. Along with the sensor positions, Thorpe had tweaked the sensor response function. Quite incidentally it now emphasized certain wavelengths, exactly as the beryllium sensors themselves did when struck by the bomb‚Äôs radiation. No wonder it matched the test data so well. Now that he saw it, the flaw jumped out like a figure from an optical illusion. Glue in a house of cards. And down in a corner of Null‚Äôs whiteboard, half erased, was it? yes, the same function, same tweak. It had been in the corner of Quine‚Äôs eye for months. Wasted months. Wrong from the start. Error fraud? No way to know. Maybe started as one, became the other. Sleep soon. Faint light outside. But wait. If you removed the tweak, if you stopped trying for a beam, chaff fell from the problem and the expressions said something else entirely.</p>
<p>A presence entered the room. Air gravid and light adance. Instead of the battle station there appeared to his mind‚Äôs eye a congruent tide of radiance, all the universe‚Äôs light at wavelengths and colors beyond mere vision, streaming in intricate brocade, weaving and mediating between matter and energy, wave and particle, the phenomenal and the noumenal. Here was the central mystery, laid open for his knowing, and at the very gate of revelation he knew he was unprepared to pass into this realm of light, and he drew back. The presence, like a roebuck in forest, startled and was gone.</p>
<p>Cold rage at aspirations dashed and traduced. In compensation, then, knowledge reborn as an instrument of power. Though mystery elude, information is sure. <em>Thus angels must feel, radiant with the certainty that flows from might.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>‚ÄìBernd, I need some sensors.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFor Taliesin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes. [pg253]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have a work order already, this morning, from Thorpe.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI need more.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe do not have time to add</p>
<p>‚ÄìFind the time. I want sensors on there made of something other than beryllium.</p>
<p>Dietz was silent. He began leafing through a logbook. ‚ÄìDo you know, try as we might we cannot keep traces of oxygen out of the beryllium. I have told Highet this. Long ago.</p>
<p>‚ÄìReally.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have proposed hydrogen in the past.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou have? Why haven‚Äôt we tried it?</p>
<p>‚Äì‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mess with success.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄìI see. I‚Äôd like to try it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoes Highet know?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll take responsibility.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWithout his approval I can do little.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBernd. This is what Slater thought, isn‚Äôt it. That the beryllium sensors were giving false brightness. And Null knew it too, didn‚Äôt he.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI did not see Slater‚Äôs report.</p>
<p>‚ÄìMake some hydrogen for me. Cable them separately from the beryllium.</p>
<p>Dietz shut the book. ‚ÄìSend me a work order. I will have to send a copy to Highet.</p>
<p>Kihara came through the doors with a following of suited men. ‚ÄìWon‚Äôt be a minute, gentlemen, don‚Äôt let us disturb you, you can see here the precision engineering we‚Äôre capable of, bang-up job of inventiveness, maximum return on investment, the answer to reversing the balance of trade deficit, innovative federally generated technology transfer to industry, improves the nation‚Äôs economic competitiveness as we work deliberately and consciously to build partnerships, a new class of information with commercial value, very creative cooperative efforts, freedom to negotiate intellectual property rights, fees and royalties, cover the technological waterfront, take for instance these fine-grained superplastic steels, not to mention X-ray lithography‚Ä¶ and Quine returned to his office rummaging through CENTURY 21, Rings Fields and Groups, Computer Addict Wholesale Microcenter, TeX Technical Reference, to come upon WORK ORDER Form 4439A Authorized Use Only, and sat for a minute holding a pen above it suddenly frozen at the sound of Thorpe‚Äôs approaching voice, ‚Äìyou have to invoke the world control option from the command line, relaxing as the voice receded, pen moving to spell SECONDARY SENSOR ARRAY.</p>
<hr />
<p>[pg254] From Highet‚Äôs open door he heard, ‚ÄìYou want less pressure, try the Institute for Advanced Salaries, it‚Äôs a fucking retirement village for the reality-impaired! and a lower voice unintelligible in response, then ‚ÄìI don‚Äôt care, I want results! the lower voice growing sharper: ‚Äìis cheap. My people have to make it happen, as the door opened and Dietz, pale and shaking, came out past Quine glancing at him without a word and stormed down the hall, Highet following to the door, calling out, ‚ÄìA beard without a mustache, does that make you an honest man? and to Quine, ‚ÄìYou. I don‚Äôt want to talk to you now. Send me e-mail.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI think you‚Äôll want to hear this. We can show quantitative agreement.</p>
<p>Highet looked at him with loathing. ‚ÄìYou want to change the sensors. The day before the shot.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI want to try hydrogen.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThat‚Äôs an incredibly bad idea, that‚Äôs totally braindead, to introduce a new measurement technique at this stage. You have to calibrate, you have to</p>
<p>‚ÄìIf Slater‚Äôs right, if the beryllium shows false brightness, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until we know it. It might as well be now. Or do you want to spend fifty million on another shot?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd love to. Who told you Slater said that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt‚Äôs common knowledge. We‚Äôll have to address the issue eventually.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCommon knowledge. My ass.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt might be wise to preempt questions about it. The shot‚Äôs so close to the presentation, we can‚Äôt be expected to have formal data that quickly. But we could say we‚Äôre investigating. If we have to.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre sure about the quantitative agreement?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe simulation‚Äôs excellent. I won‚Äôt take credit for it. Jef Thorpe did the work.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDid he now. Well, we‚Äôre a team. Good results show good management.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôd like Jef to give the presentation.</p>
<p>Highet‚Äôs eyes fixed in calculation on Quine as the phone rang and Quine waited for the dismissive wave with which Highet ended audiences, but instead he spoke a moment, then covered the mouthpiece and said, ‚Äìwant to make some money Philip, Devon Null‚Äôs taking on investors, and uncovering the mouthpiece, ‚Äìyes, application‚Äôs outside the envelope no problem there, keep me briefed, and in another moment hung up, leaning back and clasping his hands over his thinning crown, gazing at the ceiling.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell that‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs very fine. Wonder if we could work up a little something. I could invite some key people to the ranch for the shot, some unnamed sources, goose the process a little, can we get Thorpe in on this? [pg255]</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôs probably in my office.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou may work out yet Philip, Highet grudged as one thick finger stabbed the phone. ‚ÄìJef? Leo. Get your ass over here, rising to pace past framed and signed photos of three presidents, another of R√©ti and himself with the current president, artist‚Äôs renderings of the Superbright and of a fusion-driven spaceship, cartoon of a mushroom cloud WHEN YOU CARE ENOUGH TO SEND THE VERY BEST, certificates from professional societies, a length of cable, a circuit board. He stopped at the windows, gaze caught by something, and parted the vertical slats of the blind with his fingers, speaking softly, almost to himself.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you know the darkness that‚Äôs out there? Do you realize how tenuous this all is? Twenty thousand years of civilization, and only in the last five hundred has rationality begun to displace superstition. I tell you that I would sup with the devil, I would court armageddon, not to lose that. When I think of those fucking tree huggers out there‚Ä¶ and turning back to Quine, voice low and insistent, ‚ÄìThink the ills are in a system, think it‚Äôs that simple, R√©ti with his anticommunism, your new girlfriend and her peacenik buddies, wonder why‚Äôs she drawn to you?</p>
<p>Quine said nothing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDarkness and malady is in the human heart, Philip, you can‚Äôt eradicate it, don‚Äôt you know that? The enemy is the heart. And all you can do is propitiate the darkness there‚Ä¶ as Thorpe arrived in black linen jacket, red T-shirt, nose stud, eyes eager, and Highet‚Äôs demeanor switched to the cheerful, ‚ÄìJef, my man. I want to wow the rubes when we go to the desert. We have a ranch out there with a data feed from the test site. What can you do that‚Äôs portable and fantastic? I want flash that makes you reach for your checkbook.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHey, I‚Äôve got an interface toolkit from my CodeWin days, I can throw something together overnight. Just tell me what kind of data I have to work with.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôll e-mail the details. Shot‚Äôs tomorrow evening, you‚Äôll have to get a plane out by noon to set up. Not too much for you, is it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìDemo or die, I know the drill, said Thorpe, grinning.</p>
<hr />
<p>The evening wind whipped dust across the flat stretch of highway, slowing traffic and shuddering the shells of cars backed up across three lanes behind flashing lights at EXIT NLY CODOR IC S as Quine punched ‚Äìillion in property loss, over to ‚Äìnoninjury accident being cleared at the Codornices Road exit not blocking lanes for you, drowned in a siren blaring up the shoulder OHLONE VALLEY RESCUE ECNALUBMA as Quine edged against horns and unheard curses into the exit lane and cut back on a commercial strip to loop up behind the central mall the reverse of whose colonnaded [pg256] and pedimented facade, raw concrete stained by long ago rains, caught with a sort of wounded dignity the sun‚Äôs last rays as they lanced past Estancia Estates An Adult Community where Quine parked and for a moment held in his gaze a prospect of bungalows arrayed on lawns billiardgreen out to their surveyed boundary of dry pasture before ascending the walk and ringing the bell.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh! Philip. Come in. I wasn‚Äôt expecting you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell it‚Äôs Friday night, I thought</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh I‚Äôm glad you, but just, if you‚Äôd called I would have made dinner‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wasn‚Äôt sure I was coming.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour work is done?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs a test. I fly out tomorrow afternoon. And there‚Äôs a presentation Monday.</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan you stay tonight? We can go out for‚Ä¶ is something wrong?</p>
<p>‚ÄìCan I ask who‚Äôs the guy with the curly black hair and the good tan?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe, what?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI happened to see you both the other day. In a hallway. He was acting pretty proprietary.</p>
<p>‚ÄìProprie‚Ä¶ Nan‚Äôs face flushed.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHow long has this been going on?</p>
<p>‚ÄìHis name‚Äôs Ben and he‚Äôs a good friend, and it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve been friends for years. Five years at least. Since before I knew you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou still see him?</p>
<p>The flush darkened, and her mild features contorted into an anger he‚Äôd never seen in her. ‚ÄìYou mean, do I sleep with him? Yes, I have, once or twice since you and I have been together.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOnce or twice. You‚Äôve lost count.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, Philip! Why are you, this is hateful!</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt hurts me, Nan.</p>
<p>Her face was a mask of plain misery. ‚ÄìWe never</p>
<p>‚ÄìNever what, laid down rules? No, I didn‚Äôt think we had to, I thought some things went without saying.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWithout saying what! that I‚Äôm yours alone when you don‚Äôt give me anything, not even a word of love, for God‚Äôs sake Philip I didn‚Äôt turn to Ben for sex, just for, for kindness, to feel that I <em>mattered</em> to someone! A year, almost two years of my life Philip, I‚Äôm no longer a young woman, do you want to know when it was I saw Ben, when it was I went to him after you and I were together?</p>
<p>The coldness, the absolute coldness of the moment.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt even care do you. When we met, at the Labor Day picnic two years ago, and I was so charmed by you, your intelligence, your modesty, [pg257] yoru reserve. Do you remember, there was a thunderstorm? I hadn‚Äôt seen one since moving West. And you took me home, we were drenched, and I loaned you clothes. Oh Philip, it was over between Ben and me he was like a brother, I just wanted to, I don‚Äôt know, say good-bye, tell someone close to me how happy I thought I‚Äôd be.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd the second time?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, a year later, when you didn‚Äôt come to dinner, didn‚Äôt call, and I waited and waited so it was only an anniversary just a date on the calendar that‚Äôs all but I called Ben and he came over to be with me, and he didn‚Äôt, didn‚Äôt even <em>want</em>‚Ä¶ cut off by her sobs, jagged and piercing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I, you knew I was in a meeting, you could have</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd you call him proprietary! When you come here and, and sulk for hours, barely acknowledge my existence, don‚Äôt call for days on end, and then expect, how do you think that makes me feel‚Ä¶ cut by sobs, ‚Äìand you‚Äôve never, never asked me what I want, how I feel, I would have told you about Ben if you‚Äôd asked if you‚Äôd shown any interest at all in my past. I don‚Äôt think you know who I am!</p>
<p>Within him a stone fell and fell, soundlessly turning.</p>
<p>‚ÄìPhilip, talk to me! Don‚Äôt turn off like this!</p>
<p>‚ÄìI have nothing to say, and he was out the door, where streetlights had come on, knowing that his leaving was a catastrophe more final than anything gone before, a withdrawal he could never make right. Don‚Äôt tell me, don‚Äôt tell me we don‚Äôt feed the emptiness in each other. Betrayal is an aether through which an energy moves.</p>

<h3>5</h3>
<p>One hundred miles from Mesa Encantada, whose tracts of waste and infecund desert had been reclaimed for science as Site 600, was the Advanced Research Institute of the Eastern Sierra, a ranch at the edge of the Owens Valley, a black facility whose funding appeared in no budget. Deeded to the government by a conservative rancher, it served as a layover site for Lab personnel on their way to the desert. It nestled in the broad base of a canyon near a creek‚Äôs loud runoff through lateral moraine. To the west the ground rose in the space of a few miles from six thousand feet to a twelve thousand foot crest of granite crags. Below, to the east, the highway lay like a ribbon dropped across the wrinkled valley floor, and a hundred miles farther across desert dotted with sage under a flotilla of thunderheads was Mesa Encantada.</p>
<p>Even before the Labs, Quine had seen ARIES. On his first trip west, while switching planes at Phoenix, he‚Äôd been paged and diverted to a single-engine craft bound for a Kern County airstrip, where a sheriff‚Äôs four [pg258] by four awaited him. The first Radiance shot had just gone off and at the ranch they were celebrating. Quine met Highet there as he beat a twelve-year-old at chess, telling the boy, I‚Äôll trade a bishop for a knight anytime, I love knights, they leap barriers, they face eight ways at once.</p>
<p>A month after that he was at the Mesa. Rank smell of sage hovered in the predawn cool, immensities of desert air quivered to the horizon. They drove upcanyon with the sun rising behind him, the young initiates joking, group leaders and guards and observers in DoD hardhats silent and grim. Roadways of cables led from instrument trailers over desert pocked with the collapsed craters of previous tests to the distant borehole. Above it a red crane pointing straight up. The count reached zero. And the earth rippled. A wave rushed toward them and the ground shook as if a train were passing and passing and passing. When it stopped the air was a clear plasma of exaltation. To know that the binding forces of matter were yours to break, the wealth of nations yours to drive into such sublime force, this was a deep and secret sweetness known only to the few.</p>
<p>At the ranch now Thorpe was joking with some grad students from X Section. Others were there from J Section, and some stern faces he didn‚Äôt know, military or intelligence, and Steradian alert as a corrupt deputy. Highet arrived in black Western shirt with red and white embroidery across the yoke, blue jeans, and tooled leather boots, carrying cases of soda, chanting in a false twang, ‚ÄìTwaace the sugar, twaace the caffeine‚Ä¶ followed by a Western senator, cadaverous and grinning in white Stetson, and his young aide plump and groomed to a sheen, with the zealous black eyes of a pullet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook at em, young, brilliant, confident, said the senator. ‚ÄìThat‚Äôs how I felt at their age. They own the world.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe world? retorted Highet. ‚ÄìThey own their genitals. The rest of them‚Äôs mine, raising his voice to introduce, ‚ÄìGentlemen, the right honorable Howard Bangerter, R-Utah‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The aide asked if physics had yet succeeded in finding in the traces of Creation the fingerprints of God, and Highet nodded, a slow smile spreading and his tonguetip darting as his hands rose to conjure, ‚ÄìNot God exactly‚Ä¶ as Quine walked onto the deck where three barbecue grills sizzled, and a keg of Coors Lite sat amidst greasy paper plates bearing the ruins of meals, and the sun had long since chased the waning moon, itself pursuing Venus, behind the mountain wall. Although the sky retained day‚Äôs blue a chill came down from the remote snowless peaks.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis young man, Highet‚Äôs voice carried out from within, won last year‚Äôs Heinrich Hertz Fellowship in Physics, a prestigious award I happen to administer‚Ä¶ and Quine stepped down from the deck, crossing dry grass to the creek‚Äôs rockstrewn willowed bank where it trickled through [pg259] small pools and clumps of rotting leaves. Quine followed it up, breath laboring. He stopped at a large boulder long ago frostwedged and tumbled from a higher place, and sat. No residue of warmth. The western ridge was a great dark wave. In the east a glamour of rosetint clouds swept up from the horizon. The ranch was small below him. A wind came down the great wall of rock. Into this chaos he might ascend and be lost.</p>
<p>But he did not. He returned to the ranch, Thorpe‚Äôs voice coming as he slid open the glass doors, ‚Äìbackground, trucks on the highway, that sort of thing. Other side of the spool you can see some small temblors we had this afternoon. When the shot goes off we‚Äôll definitely see more than a wiggle. But the real action‚Äôs on screen. At the site they‚Äôre recording everything for later analysis but data‚Äôs also piped to this workstation where autocorrelation software I wrote gives us an immediate window on what‚Äôs happening. Red is intense energy, blue less intense. We‚Äôre looking for a red ringlike structure.</p>
<p>Quine watched the stylus quiver as about him others conversed. Without warning the stylus jerked. The screen of the workstation came to life, numbers flowing down its right edge. Colors coalesced fitfully on screen. The senator and his aide leaned in enrapt. A minute passed. Blue and green surrounded a corona of yellow and a jagged red core flecked with white.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe have brightness, Thorpe said. ‚ÄìA hundred times the last test. More. Maybe a thousand times.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThree orders of magnitude improvement in six months, declared Highet. ‚ÄìAt this rate we‚Äôll have every enemy missile on Earth neutralized in a few years, and raising his tone with his glass, ‚ÄìTo Team Radiance! Leonardos of the age. You people are the best in the world.</p>
<p>Grunts and howls of triumph went off like rockets.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDo you all know what we‚Äôve done? We‚Äôve broken the back of Communism. And that‚Äôs only so far.</p>
<p>More applause. The senator‚Äôs aide leaned smiling to whisper in the senator‚Äôs ear.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNeed now‚Äôs a nice little war where we can demo this stuff. Feed some tinhorn tyrant some antiquated missiles and provoke him to use them.</p>
<p>A second wave of guests arrived, a dozen men in suits adorned with MAMMOTH CONVENTION CENTER NAME COMPANY and a few women packaged as brightly as new software, and Quine moved off through the manic younger men hopped up by caffeine and sugar and the shot.</p>

<p><em>Nature is more ready in her creating than time in his destroying, and so she has ordained that many animals shall be food for others.</em></p>
<p>He continued downstairs toward a light. In the cellar seven or eight young men from X Section were gathered around an old rackmounted minicomputer and a pool table.</p>
<p>‚Äìso he goes, learn to hassle people and lie with a straight face.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcuse me, I need to get back. Does anyone know the arrangements?</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcellent advice, dude.</p>
<p>‚ÄìExcuse</p>
<p>One glanced up. ‚ÄìThere‚Äôs pool cars outside somewhere.</p>
<p>Full dark. A dozen cars. E108637. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICIAL [pg262] USE ONLY. Key in the column. The seat harness slid up and drew in over his chest and waist as a chime sounded and dash lights blinked red then glowed teal. The car swayed and bounced for a mile down the dirt road. There the highway stretched north and south into void, under stars like chips of ice. He could go anywhere. But time was a field that moved with him, inescapable, close as the blue light in the cabin. He drove for hours without stopping, radio for company, wash of noise, hollowness in his being. Mountains that a century ago killed emigrants with their rigors fell to his vehicle. Descending to the flats, he saw brushfires crawling brightly on far ridges like luminous protolife, like the fitful colors on Thorpe‚Äôs screen from the bad sensors, and the fires fell away behind him and the farm cities loomed on the ancient seabed, their lights and capillary highways glowing with perfervid intensity in the unnatural warmth persisting from this arid summer long past its term, its heat bonded to the earth like some toxin to a susceptible organ, and booming through the car‚Äôs windows when he opened them was the smell of dust, manure, smoke, exhaust, chemicals, and he crossed the last ridge to arrive in his valley of a million souls, of all the places he might go, for all the freedom he had, here again.</p>
<p>In the dark apartment he stripped, trailing damp rank clothes to the bathroom. The mirror‚Äôs sudden light showed him, before selfhood interposed its protective assurance, the face of a stranger, aging and vulnerable. The soft flesh of his body was without tone or color. Lowering his eyes from the harsh brightness he stood voiding for long seconds. A ribbon of urine twisted along the axis of its arc as it splashed into the bowl. Standing thus he blinked, faded, woke. The gates of sleep stood open and he was through them, uncleansed, as soon as he lay down.</p>
<p>On a moonless night at the edge of a forest there is the slap and sizzle of rainfall. A moist breeze springs up. Yet where he stands, in long grass, all is dry. Only in the forest is it raining. A figure in the forest shadows stands regarding him. It holds an offering of some kind, a gift. He does not move to take the gift, and shortly the figure recedes into the forest.</p>

<h3>6</h3>
<p>Gathering before dawn the crowd set out for the main gate, to be met by police as unceasing arrivals swelled it further, until Lab workers began to show up in their vehicles and county and city police were called to divert traffic to the north gate against the columns of people still coming, and the south road was closed to vehicles and state police summoned, and still the spectacle slowed traffic to walking speed, so that Quine was late to Highet‚Äôs office where Highet stared out his window at the south road.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose people out there will never understand. It could be so much [pg263] worse. On the other side, entire cities, entire regions have no civilian industry at all, it‚Äôs all military. Here we cut our deals as needed but we still do real science. We bring in people like you. We roll back the darkness.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs a problem.</p>
<p>Highet turned. ‚ÄìWhat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe beryllium and hydrogen sensors were cabled separately. Thorpe‚Äôs analysis at the ranch used only the beryllium. I looked at the hydrogen data yesterday. No brightness. No beam. Nothing there.</p>
<p>Nodding, Highet turned again to the window. ‚ÄìI see. The hydrogen sensors which I asked you not to use. You know, I almost stopped that work order, came that close. But I wanted to see what you had in mind.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAs supervisor it was my decision.</p>
<p>‚ÄìOn your head be it. Where‚Äôs your quantitative agreement now?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou saw at the ranch. The beryllium shows it. Spectrum peaks as predicted. But that‚Äôs not a focused X-ray, that‚Äôs oxygen in the beryllium glowing at just the right wavelength. It looks exactly like the new model‚Äôs predictions for focus.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAnd where did this new model come from?</p>
<p>‚ÄìThorpe‚Äôs been modifying my code. I found a routine where just this set of frequencies is amplified. You‚Äôll find that my copies of the files haven‚Äôt been modified for ten days.</p>
<p>Highet came from the window, pacing past the photos of presidents and artists‚Äô renderings, touching the length of cable.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI see. Well, this is bad for him, you know. Especially after Fish and Himmelhoch. He has a history.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI wouldn‚Äôt call it intentional. The ideas he brought were good. I worked with him, I didn‚Äôt see this, it could have happened to anyone.</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt doesn‚Äôt matter. He has a history, voice sharpening, ‚Äìquackery or carelessness, you think it matters? You think you can ever walk away from your history?</p>
<p>Quine said nothing.</p>
<p>‚ÄìNow those hydrogen sensors, you piggybacked your own little test onto the piggyback, that was very cute. Did Thorpe know about that?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou saw the work orders.</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe knew he was getting feed from the beryllium only?</p>
<p>‚ÄìIt was his demo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes, you saw to that. All right. We‚Äôll keep him on for a while. Then you‚Äôll write him a letter of recommendation. Down the road we‚Äôll issue a report on the false brightness. You‚Äôll be group leader on that. Highet‚Äôs voice was tight with controlled fury. ‚ÄìYou begin to interest me, Philip. I thought I knew what to expect from you.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAt least we caught this now. [pg264]</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh no we haven‚Äôt. We haven‚Äôt caught a thing yet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want to sound naive, you‚Äôre not going to mention this at the presentation?</p>
<p>‚ÄìToday? I think not. I think I will not at this time give the enemies of reason grounds sufficient to bury an entire body of knowledge and aspiration. Highet lifted from his desk a small device etched with a craft undreamed of even a decade before, raising it before him like a talisman, then replaced it and gazed at Quine implacably. ‚ÄìI believe not.</p>
<p>The telephone rang and Highet lifted it in midring, ‚ÄìNo I can‚Äôt see anyone right now, as Nolan came through the door bearing a red folder, acknowledging Quine with a minute change of expression.</p>
<p>‚ÄìVery clean data from your shot, said Nolan.</p>
<p>‚Äìno damn it Senator Chase is coming in an hour</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh, you‚Äôve seen it?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe prepared the overheads. A match with theory unparalleled since Mendel‚Äôs peas. Kid‚Äôs a barn burner is he?</p>
<p>‚Äìwhat do you mean here now? We‚Äôre not set up</p>
<p>‚ÄìHe‚Äôd like to be.</p>
<p>‚Äìdamn it keep him down there</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre taking him under your wing.</p>
<p>‚Äìfucking lantern-jawed hero of the people can just wait</p>
<p>‚ÄìMy political skills are legendary, Quine joked.</p>
<p>‚Äìdon‚Äôt care! Do whatever it takes! I‚Äôll call you when we‚Äôre ready.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôve noticed, Nolan said, turning to Highet as he put down the phone.</p>
<p>‚Äìhave to do everyone‚Äôs job, what‚Äôs this?</p>
<p>‚ÄìOverheads of the Taliesin data.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, just leave them. Bernd there you are find the rest of the team will you get them up here we have a little problem god damn senator from the liberal east arrived just a little ahead of schedule he‚Äôs downsta, Aron where the hell have you been we‚Äôve got a PR‚Ä¶ Nolan!_-</p>
<p>‚ÄìOh! I just, sorry, didn‚Äôt see your foot</p>
<p>‚ÄìJeez sorry Aron let me help you up‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìNolan will you get the hell</p>
<p>‚Äìmy slides! here don‚Äôt step on</p>
<p>‚ÄìNolan!</p>
<p>‚Äìjust put these back in order, with the ah integrated twenty-four-bit color TGIF animations and music in standard MIDI files</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron</p>
<p>‚Äìlittle problem with the synthesizer all the instruments stuck on the cowbell patch so when we played the <em>Apocalypse Now</em> music, the Wager Valk, rather intriguing actually but hardly [pg265]</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron, will you</p>
<p>‚Äìthen our Silicon Graphics machine couldn‚Äôt read the TGIFs so we converted them to Video Postscript but somehow they came out black and white one inch square so</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron, will you please</p>
<p>‚Äìgo low tech instead, keep it simple, four synchronized slide projectors overheads eight-track digital tape</p>
<p>‚ÄìAron, get up! Leave the, will you leave the slides on the floor. Go to the lobby. Keep Senator Chase busy down there.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut I</p>
<p>‚ÄìGo! and pacing to the window, parting the blind, ‚ÄìFuck‚Äôs this going to play like, must be a thousand of them in the road.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThe news said two thousand, said Dietz.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThey‚Äôll claim five. Supposed to keep these assholes away from the main gate put them up in the north corner, I want to know how this got out! glaring at Quine, ‚ÄìI want to know who‚Äôs been talking to these people, who let them know Chase was coming today.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLeo, it‚Äôs symbolic. Today‚Äôs Armistice Day, you know?</p>
<p>‚ÄìShit on that, it‚Äôs to embarrass us. All for Chase. Man keeps calling me up about twenty kilos of plutonium gone missing, I keep telling him we don‚Äôt stockpile plutonium here.</p>
<p>‚ÄìBut we do, Leo.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWell, Bernd, Chase doesn‚Äôt have the clearance to know that, and picking up the phone midring, ‚ÄìYes? Damn it, Aron, just, look, take him to the downstairs conference room think you can do that? ‚Ä¶no will you forget the fucking slides, thumbing the phone‚Äôs button, ‚ÄìWhere‚Äôs Szabo? You all go down, I‚Äôm right behind you.</p>
<hr />
<p>‚ÄìSenator, glad you could make it. This all? Expecting more of your colleagues‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet. These two gentlemen are from the General Accounting Office. You‚Äôll be seeing more of them.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhy don‚Äôt you all take a seat and we‚Äôll begin.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThere‚Äôs just one thing I want to know, Doctor Highet. Is the Superbright going to work?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI believe our presentation will address any</p>
<p>‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want a presentation, I want a yes or no. at the present moment, judging from everything you have to date, is it a workable weapon, within the budget and timeframe we have?</p>
<p>‚ÄìBeyond question. In fact we have new results that show</p>
<p>‚ÄìA new Radiance test? When?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt discuss that in open session. [pg266]</p>
<p>‚ÄìThen maybe you can discuss claims of exaggeration and fraud from Warren Slater.</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose are lies. Slater sabotaged my teams repeatedly. He had reasons of his own to derail this program.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSuch as?</p>
<p>‚ÄìI can‚Äôt discuss that in open session.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSlater‚Äôs not the only critic. Some of your own people</p>
<p>‚ÄìThose are not my people. Those are people who‚Äôve made up their minds that certain technical problems are too hard to solve. They‚Äôre wrong. They could be making a contribution, but instead they find fault.</p>
<p>‚ÄìSo why are you behind schedule?</p>
<p>‚ÄìWe‚Äôre not.</p>
<p>‚ÄìAccording to your own timetable</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator, we have brilliant, creative people together here doing important work. Leave them alone and they accomplish miracles. But if you put limits on them‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou‚Äôre not answering me. I didn‚Äôt ask about miracles.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI am answering you if you‚Äôll let me. You cannot nickel and dime a program like this in the research phase, not if you exp</p>
<p>‚ÄìResearch? I thought you were engineering phase.</p>
<p>‚ÄìVery nearly.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou sent the President a letter claiming engineering phase.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI do not acknowledge that. If such a letter were to exist it would be top secret, and you lack the clearance to see it or the competence to evaluate it.</p>
<p>‚ÄìDoctor Highet I‚Äôm getting tired of this, you have oversold this program to the tune of thirty bill</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator</p>
<p>‚Äìyou have stonewalled, you have defied</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator</p>
<p>‚Äìgress, you have hidden behind classifica</p>
<p>‚ÄìSenator, you‚Äôre an asshole. You might even be a traitor.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI will not take that from you, sir!</p>
<p>‚ÄìYou don‚Äôt have a clue what‚Äôs at stake here, one look at the masses out front you‚Äôre ready to cave, sell out this nation‚Äôs security its technological edge its, breaking off for the figure in the doorway who bowed his head in apology.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGentlemen, we have had a bomb threat. We need to clear the building.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGood God.</p>
<p>‚ÄìWhat the hell?</p>
<p>‚ÄìYour peacenik constituency, Chase. Good work. [pg267]</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm not through with you, Highet.</p>
<p>‚ÄìFine, I‚Äôm willing to sit right here play Russian roulette.</p>
<p>‚ÄìGentlemen please, the security forces will be coming through, you can move to Building 101.</p>
<p>Harsh urgent clipped static blurted in the hallway. Gallop of many feet approached.</p>
<p>‚ÄìClear this area!</p>
<p>Outside the building a security squad came running in a wedge, helmeted and visored, booted in horseskin, only the flesh of their hands visible holding batons at port arms. Leather creaking, heels clattering, radios jabbering, they divided the exiting crowd and Quine was swept the wrong way, out past an unmanned checkpoint before he broke clear onto a lawn where men in blue jumpsuits trailed strips of yellow CAUTION tape on two then three sides of him and he dashed through the diminishing gap as behind him shouts were raised. Between windowless walls a stair dropped him to where two burly men rounding a corner dealt him a blow with lumber they carried, ‚ÄìJesus watch it! hurling him to his knees against a chainlink fence vibrating at the lip of a great pit. In this excavation five, seven, ten vehicles labored grinding and roaring in desperate intensity, beeping hollowly as they reversed or clanking furiously forward over a terrain of pale mud. vast as it was it would not bury a millionth of the dead should the bombs created here detonate. Quine pulled free of the fence with a tearing of fabric and went down a walkway of plywood sheets, pausing before a trailer CREDNE CONSTRUCTION in whose doorway two T-shirted men eating lunch regarded him with dispassion as with a handkerchief he rubbed dirt and blood from his palms, temple, and knee visible through ripped pants, then down a long stair of raw wood stained with mud, glancing back at concentric terraces gouged from the hillside, <em>the city is built on two levels, lords and palaces above, common workers below</em>, and rounding a corner to where a stream of people hurried past guards at a checkpoint.</p>
<p>‚ÄìLook I need to</p>
<p>‚ÄìMove on, there‚Äôs been a bomb threat.</p>
<p>‚ÄìYes but I‚Äôm in an important meeting I need to get back to</p>
<p>‚ÄìThis is a secured area.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI‚Äôm cleared dammit! clapping his breast where no photo ID, but a torn flap of pocket, depended, ‚Äìoh Christ, look my name‚Äôs Philip Quine can‚Äôt you call</p>
<p>‚ÄìKeep moving! The guard pushed him back into the stream of people advancing slowly toward the main gate. He made his way through it and broke free, starting to jog on a rough track that led to the perimeter road, where he doubled back to approach the entry kiosk from its far side passing and passing close on his left the unending mass of protesters, just beyond a [pg268] row of trees and the perimeter fence, only to stop short of the entry road where cars were stalled by the leading edge of the crowd inside coursing around them like a stream around rocks, while bullhorns blared ‚Äìpersonnel, do not exit by this gate repeat do not, and outside the gate protesters swirled in place like debris at a confluence of cataracts, held back by skirmish line of county police. Quine stood sweating and panting until sirens turned him to face four cars slewing to a stop on the perimeter road and discharging blackvested Lab security forces one of whom leveled his club at Quine and cried ‚ÄìYou!</p>
<p>Quine ran for the kiosk. More Lab police had arrived inside, forming a line to divert Lab personnel from the gate, then quickly moving forward to the gate. Quine was suddenly between two police who linked arms to bar his passage.</p>
<p>‚ÄìI belong inside. For a moment their visors, opaque, bronze, iridescent, mirrored twin Quines, elongated, battered, dismayed. Then he was seized and pushed through the gate into the street.</p>
<p>A helicopter swept overhead. He held his ears.</p>
<p><em>Let us now speak the truth as we know it. Say that the sun is round, and bright, and hot. The sun fires its acolytes, darkens their skins, elevates their wormridden souls, the sun rises in our birth and sets in our death, its writing is in the spots upon its face and in the spots it prints upon our skins. It is in us whether we labor under it or hide from it, it strikes through our souls, it ignites the light of our being, or limns the shadow of our denial.</em></p>
<p>In the crowd he saw Lynn, her dark head appearing and vanishing among others, lithe nape and shoulders bare and tanned below the cropped marge of hair, sun blazing on the straps and back of a white tank top.</p>
<p><em>Light is a wave and we are carried upon it, light is a particle to pierce us with revelation. Light is sun or moon, a heat that tempers or a gentleness that silvers with love.</em></p>
<p>He pushed toward her. At the end of its circuit the helicopter turned.</p>
<p><em>Here in the crowd are fools, innocents, knaves, here we are jostled, in hazard, we can do nothing but strive against currents, knowing how slight is our power to reach any shore we set out for.</em></p>
<p>He called her name and the call was lost in noise. The surge of the crowd pushed them together and she turned to him, eyes wide and surprised. It was not Lynn. Against their will they embraced. He clung to her until another push felled him. The cut on his knee opened and he bent to stanch it. When he rose she was gone and he was among figures wearing skulls of papier-m√¢ch√© and skeletons painted on black tights. Tambourines jangled, clattered.</p>
<p><em>Say what you know, that love is lost. That light is lost. But see, loveless our [pg269] souls still blaze. Our sun has not gone out, for fire comes to those who go not the way of light. What‚Äôs lost is well lost. See, we blaze and are not consumed.</em></p>
<p>Around him people tied kerchiefs across their faces. Overhead the helicopter roared. Its black belly glistened like a spider‚Äôs thorax, then it rocked and moved off, vanishing behind a silver mist that fell onto the crowd as gently as the first rain of spring. Tears sprang to Quine‚Äôs face and he dropped to his knees gasping and blinded, clinging to the nearest figure, saying over and over, ‚ÄìI belong inside, his voice unheard even by himself.</p>
