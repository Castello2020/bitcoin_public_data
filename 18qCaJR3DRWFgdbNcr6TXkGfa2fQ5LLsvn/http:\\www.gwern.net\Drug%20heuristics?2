<p>That intelligence (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%20factor%20%28psychometrics%29" title="Wikipedia: g factor (psychometrics)"><em>g</em></a>) in healthy people is nearly impossible to improve is clear from the failure of psychology to provide any such method. But <em>why</em> intelligence would be so constant is not as clear: many other cognitive abilities are improvable (like working memory), so why not intelligence?</p>
<p>Arthur Jensen <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.138.980&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" title="'How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?', Jensen 1969">noted</a> the failure of interventions in the 1960s, and the failure remains complete now, half a century later: if you are a bright healthy young man or woman gifted with an IQ in the 130s, there is nothing you can do to increase your underlying intelligence by a standard deviation. New methods like <a href="DNB%20FAQ">dual n-back</a> or <a href="Nootropics">nootropics</a> are trumpeted in the media, and years later are discovered to increase motivation &amp; not intelligence, or to have been overstated, or work only in damaged or <a href="Iodine">deficient subpopulations</a>, or to be statistical/<a href="DNB%20meta-analysis">methodological artifacts</a>, or to be tantamount to training on IQ tests themselves which destroys their meaning (like memorizing vocabulary), or to be so anomalous as to verge on fraudulent (like the <a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jussim/Teacher%20Expectations%20PSPR%202005.pdf" title="'Teacher Expectations and Self-Fulfilling Prophecies: Knowns and Unknowns, Resolved and Unresolved Controversies', Jussim &amp; Harber 2005">Pygmalion effect</a>). The only question worth asking is which of these explanations is the real explanation this time.</p>
<p>For IQ in particular, people discussing human-enhancement (especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transhumanists" title="Wikipedia: transhumanists">transhumanists</a>) have proposed a pessimistic observation &amp; evolutionary explanation, dubbed the ‚ÄúAlgernon principle‚Äù or ‚ÄúAlgernon‚Äôs law‚Äù or my preference, the ‚ÄúAlgernon Argument‚Äù.</p>
<section id="algernon-argument" class="level1">
<h1>Algernon Argument</h1>
<p>The famous SF story ‚Äú<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers%20for%20Algernon" title="Wikipedia: Flowers for Algernon">Flowers for Algernon</a>‚Äù postulates surgery which triples the IQ score of the retarded protagonist - but which comes with the devastating side-effects of the gain being both temporary and sometimes fatal; <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/" title="The Logical Fallacy of Generalization from Fictional Evidence">fictional evidence</a> aside, it is curious that despite the incredible progress mankind has made in countless areas like building cars or going to the moon or fighting cancer or extincting smallpox or inventing computers or artificial intelligence, we lack any meaningful way to positively affect people‚Äôs intelligence beyond curing diseases &amp; deficiencies. If we compare the smartest people in the world now like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence%20Tao" title="Wikipedia: Terence Tao">Terence Tao</a> to the smartest people of more than half a century ago like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20von%20Neumann" title="Wikipedia: John von Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, there seems to be little difference. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer%20Yudkowsky" title="Wikipedia: Eliezer Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> expands the thought out in his essay <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/200102021712/http://sysopmind.com/algernon.html">‚ÄúAlgernon‚Äôs Law‚Äù</a>, stating it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any simple major enhancement to human intelligence is a net evolutionary disadvantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lesson is that Mother Nature know best. Or alternately, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TANSTAAFL" title="Wikipedia: TANSTAAFL">TANSTAAFL</a>: ‚Äúthere ain‚Äôt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No%20free%20lunch%20theorem" title="Wikipedia: No free lunch theorem">no such thing as a free lunch</a>‚Äù.</p>
<p>Trade-offs are endemic in biology. Anything which isn‚Äôt carrying its own weight will be eliminated - organs which are no longer used will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigiality" title="Wikipedia: Vestigiality">stunted by evolution</a> and within a lifetime, unused muscles &amp; bones will start weakening or being scavenged for resources, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight%20osteopenia" title="Wikipedia: Spaceflight osteopenia">astronauts may find out</a> the hard way<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Often, if you use a drug or surgery to optimize something, you will discover penalties elsewhere. If you delay aging &amp; length lifespan as is possible in many species, you might find that you have encouraged cancer or - still worse - decreased reproduction<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> as evidenced by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenoptosis" title="Wikipedia: Phenoptosis">dramatic deaths</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salmon" title="Wikipedia: salmon">salmon</a> or brown antechinus<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>; if your immune system goes all-out against disease, you either deplete your energetic and chemical reserves<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> or risk autoimmune disorders; similarly, we heal much slower than seems possible despite the clear advantage<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>; if you try to enhance attention with an amphetamine, you destroy creativity, or if the amphetamines reduce sleep, you damage memory consolidation or peripheral awareness<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>; or improving memory (which requires active effort to maintain<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>) also increases sensitivity to pain<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and interferes with other mental tasks<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> (as increased WM does, slightly<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>); if a mouse invests in anti-aging cellular repairs, it may freeze to death<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, and so on. (What <em>are</em> we to make of inducing savant-like abilities by brute-force suppression of brain regions<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial%20direct-current%20stimulation" title="Wikipedia: Transcranial direct-current stimulation">tDCS</a> improving learning?) From this perspective, it‚Äôs not too surprising that human medicine may be largely wasted effort or harmful<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> (although most - especially doctors - would strenuously deny this). ‚ÄúHardly any man is clever enough to know all the evil he does.‚Äù<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>An analogy to complex systems is a superficial analysis at best. Many complex systems are routinely optimizable on some parameter of interest by orders of magnitudes, or at least factors. Economies grow exponentially, on the back of all sorts of improving <a href="http://pcdb.santafe.edu/">performance curves</a> which make us richer than emperors compared with our ancestors; the miracle of economic growth, built on thousands of distinct complex systems being optimized by humans, seems to go unnoticed and be so normal and taken for granted. If we were computers, an ordinary nerd with access to some liquid nitrogen could double our clock speed.</p>
<p>With intelligence, on the other hand, not only do we have no interventions to make one an order of magnitude smarter on some hypothetical measure of absolute intelligence (perhaps such a man would be to us as we are to dogs?) but we have no interventions which make one a few factors smarter (the smartest man to ever live?) nor do we even have any interventions which can move one more than a few percentage points up in the general population! We remain the same. It is as if scientists and doctors, after studying cars for centuries, shamefacedly had to admit that their thousands of experimental cars all still had their speed throttles stuck on 25-30kph - but the good news was that this new oil additive <em>might</em> make a few of the cars run 0.1kph faster!</p>
<p>This is not the usual state of affairs for even extremely complex systems. This raises the question of why all these cars are so uniformly stuck at a certain top speed and how they got to be so optimized; why are we like these fantastical cars, and not computer processors?</p>
<section id="costs" class="level2">
<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>Intelligence is an almost unalloyed good when we look at correlations in the real-world for income, longevity, happiness, contributions to science or medicine, criminality, favoring of free speech etc<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. Why is it, then, that we can find quotes like ‚Äúthe rule that human beings seem to follow is to engage the brain only when all else fails - and usually not even then‚Äù<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> or ‚ÄúIn effect, all animals are under stringent selection pressure to be as stupid as they can get away with‚Äù<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>? Why does so much psychological research, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic%23Psychology" title="Wikipedia: Heuristic#Psychology">heuristics</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive%20bias" title="Wikipedia: cognitive bias">biases</a>, seem to boil down to a dichotomy of a slow accurate way of thinking and a fast less-accurate way of thinking (‚Äúsystem I‚Äù vs ‚Äúsystem II‚Äù being just one of the innumerable pairs coined by researchers)?</p>
<p>Because thinking is expensive and slow, and while it may be an unalloyed good, it is subject to diminishing returns like anything else (if it is profitable at all in a particular niche: no bacteria needs sophisticated cognitive skills, nor most mammals) and other things become more valuable. Just another tradeoff.</p>

<section id="eoc" class="level2">
<h2>EOC</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/evolution.pdf">‚ÄúThe Wisdom of Nature: An Evolutionary Heuristic for Human Enhancement‚Äù</a><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> (<em>Human Enhancement</em> 2008), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick%20Bostrom" title="Wikipedia: Nick Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a> and Anders Sandberg put this principle as a question or challenge, ‚Äúevolutionary optimality challenge‚Äù (EOC):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the proposed intervention would result in an enhancement, why have we not already evolved to be that way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could take this as a biological version of <a href="http://www.chesterton.org/discover-chesterton/frequently-asked-questions/taking-a-fence-down/">Chesterton‚Äôs fence</a>. Evolution is a massively parallel search process which has been running on humans (and predecessor organisms) for billions of years, ruthlessly optimizing for reproductive fitness. It is an immensely stupid and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/" title="An Alien God">blind idiot god</a> which will accomplish its goal by any available means, and if that means evolutionary mechanisms will cause individuals to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/l5/evolving_to_extinction/" title="Evolving to Extinction">drive their own species extinct</a> because this was the fittest thing for each individual to do or if the highly artificial &amp; unlikely conditions for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/group%20selection" title="Wikipedia: group selection">group selection</a> are enforced by an experimenter and evolution causes group norms of <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kw/the_tragedy_of_group_selectionism/" title="The Tragedy of Group Selectionism">mass infanticidal cannibalization</a> to develop, so be it!</p>
<p>It is of course possible for a new mutation to be fitter or for the environment to change and render some alternative more fit. This is <em>sometimes</em> true, but it is overwhelmingly <em>usually</em> false. If you do not believe me, feel free to go try to beat just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market%20hypothesis" title="Wikipedia: Efficient-market hypothesis">the stock market</a>, or if you‚Äôre up for a challenge, be more reproductively fit in a tuna fish‚Äôs niche than the tuna fish. Every so often you hear of a hedge fund which found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%20%28investment%29" title="Wikipedia: Alpha (investment)">alpha</a>, or of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive%20species" title="Wikipedia: Invasive species">invading alien species</a> that is beating the native flora: but remember that they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection%20bias" title="Wikipedia: Selection bias">just one such</a> fund or species out of thousands and thousands trying. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis%20Bacon" title="Wikipedia: Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a good answer that was made by one who when they showed him hanging in a temple a picture of those who had paid their vows as having escaped shipwreck, and would have him say whether he did not now acknowledge the power of the gods, - ‚ÄúAye‚Äù, asked he again, ‚Äúbut where are they painted that were drowned after their vows?‚Äù And such is the way of all superstition, whether in astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments, or the like; wherein men, having a delight in such vanities, mark the events where they are fulfilled, but where they fail, though this happens much oftener, neglect and pass them by.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are exceptions which prove the rule; they are, in fact, the exceptions which <em>cause</em> the rule to be true, by exploiting the niche or opportunity. Suppose we turned out to be harmfully miserly with calories and there is some receptor (such as those acted upon by stimulants like caffeine or <a href="Nicotine">nicotine</a>) which triggers a cascade of changes leading to behavior which is a superior tradeoff in caloric consumption vs activity. Evolution would slowly increase the market-share of alleles which affect this receptor, and after a while, the new level of activity would become optimal and now use of a stimulant affecting the receptor would cease to be fit because it cranks it too high. There may be some such opportunities available to humans today, since we know of past opportunities like adult lactose tolerance which have been sweeping through gene pools over the past thousand years, but can we really claim that all the interventions in which we differ from our distant ancestors can be traced to such reproductive fitness justifications? (And people think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolutionary%20psychology" title="Wikipedia: evolutionary psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> overreaches and speculates without evidence!) Theoretical calculations apparently indicate that in a changing environment, the ‚Äúreproductive fitness gap‚Äù between the current allele and its alternatives will be small and large gaps exponentially rare<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>; this seems intuitive - to continue the market analogy, the bigger the arbitrage, the faster it will be exploited.</p>
<p>Obviously we humans do intervene all the time, and many of those interventions are worthwhile. Women, for example, are big fans of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined%20oral%20contraceptive%20pill" title="Wikipedia: Combined oral contraceptive pill">birth control</a>, and if the female reproductive system isn‚Äôt controlled by evolution, nothing is. How are we to reconcile the theoretical expectation that we should find it nigh-impossible to beat evolution at its own game with the observed fact that we seem to intervene successfully all the time?</p>
<section id="loopholes" class="level3">
<h3>Loopholes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What a book a devil‚Äôs chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful blundering, low and horribly cruel works of nature!<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a profound truth - realized in the nineteenth century by only a handful of astute biologists and by philosophers hardly at all (indeed, most of those who held and views on the matter held a contrary opinion) - a profound truth that Nature does not know best; that genetical evolution, if we choose to look at it liverishly instead of with fatuous good humor, is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and blunder.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There may be no free lunches, but might there be some cheap lunches? Yudkowsky‚Äôs formulation points out several ways to escape the argument:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>interventions may not be <em>simple</em></p>
So one might find major enhancements through some very complex surgery or prosthetic; perhaps brain implants which expand memory or enable (controlled) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wireheading" title="Wikipedia: wireheading">wireheading</a>. Evolution is a search procedure finds local optima, which are not necessarily global optima. Examples like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence%20of%20common%20descent%23Recurrent%20laryngeal%20nerve%20in%20giraffes" title="Wikipedia: Evidence of common descent#Recurrent laryngeal nerve in giraffes">giraffe‚Äôs nerves</a> demonstrates such traps, but how would evolution fix them? Even if a mutation sudden made the nerve go the shorter direction, it‚Äôs not clear what other changes would have to be made to deal with this improvement, and this combination of multiple rare mutations may not happen enough times for the small reproductive fitness improvement (less resources used on nerves) to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kt/evolutions_are_stupid_but_work_anyway/" title="Evolutions Are Stupid (But Work Anyway)">make it</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation%20%28population%20genetics%29" title="Wikipedia: Fixation (population genetics)">fixation</a>.</li>
<li><p>the simple interventions may not lead to a <em>major</em> enhancement</p>
Nutritional supplements are examples; it makes perfect sense that fixing a chemical deficiency could be a simple matter and enhance reproductive fitness - but one would expect only minor mental enhancements and this effect would not generalize to very many people. (Similarly, most nootropics do not do very much.)</li>
<li><p>the intervention may be simple, give major enhancements, but result in a <em>net</em> loss of reproductive fitness</p>
<p>The famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi%20intelligence" title="Wikipedia: Ashkenazi intelligence">Ashkenazi theory of intelligence</a> comes to mind. According to this theory, the Ashkenazi were forced into occupations demanding intelligence, and micro-selected for high intelligence. Except the high IQ genes were not previously prevalent among either Jews or gentiles because - like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sickle-cell%20anemia" title="Wikipedia: sickle-cell anemia">sickle-cell anemia</a> - when they became too prevalent, they result in horrible diseases like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay-Sachs" title="Wikipedia: Tay-Sachs">Tay-Sachs</a>. In 2007, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2740882/" title="'Genetic enhancement of cognition in a kindred with cone-rod dystrophy due to _RIMS1_ mutation', Sisodiya et al 2007">a unique mutation in a Scottish family</a> was found to increase verbal IQ in afflicted family members vs non by something like 25 points; this would be great for them - except for how that mutation starts causing <em>blindness</em> in one‚Äôs 20s or later. (In general, it‚Äôs much easier to find mutations or other genetic changes breaking intelligence than helping<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Bostrom also offers 3 categories of ways in which interventions can escape his ‚ÄòEOC‚Äô:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>‚Äú<em>Changed tradeoffs</em>. Evolution ‚Äòdesigned‚Äô the system for operation in one type of environment, but now we wish to deploy it in a very different type of environment. It is not surprising, then, that we might be able to modify the system better to meet the demands imposed on it by the new environment.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Value discordance</em>. There is a discrepancy between the standards by which evolution measured the quality of her work, and the standards that we wish to apply. Even if evolution had managed to build the finest reproduction-and-survival machine imaginable, we may still have reason to change it because what we value is not primarily to be maximally effective inclusive-reproductive-fitness optimizers.</li>
<li><em>Evolutionary restrictions</em>. We have access to various tools, materials, and techniques that were unavailable to evolution. Even if our engineering talent is far inferior to evolution‚Äôs, we may nevertheless be able to achieve certain things that stumped evolution, thanks to these novel aids.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of how not to escape the EOC, I believe, is offered in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114293/">‚ÄúThe Likelihood of Cognitive Enhancement‚Äù</a> (Lynch et al 2012), when the authors attempt to argue that powerful nootropics are possible:</p>

<p>But perhaps the ‚Äòroom for improvement‚Äô issue can be recast in terms of brain evolution by asking whether comparative anatomical evidence points to strong adaptive pressures for designs that are logically related to improved cognitive performance. Anatomists often resort to allometry when dealing with questions of selective pressures on brain regions. Applied to brain proportions, this involves collecting measurements for the region of interest - e.g., frontal cortex ‚Äì for a series of animals within a given taxonomic group and then relating it to the volume or weight of the brains of those animals. This can establish with a relatively small degree of error whether a brain component in a particular species is larger than would be predicted from that species‚Äô brain size. While there is not a great deal of evidence, studies of this type point to the conclusion that cortical subdivisions in humans, including association regions, are about as large as expected for an anthropoid primate with a 1350cc brain. The volume of area 10 of human frontal cortex, for example, fits on the regression line (area 10 vs.¬†whole brain) calculated from published data (Semendeferi et al., 2001) for a series composed of gibbons, apes and humans (Lynch and Granger, 2008). Given that this region is widely assumed to play a central role in executive functions and working memory, these observations do not encourage the idea that selective pressures for cognition have differentially shaped the proportions of human cortex. Importantly, this does not mean that those proportions are in any sense typical. The allometric equations involve different exponents for different regions, meaning that absolute proportions (e.g., primary sensory cortex vs.¬†association cortex) change as brains grow larger. The balance of parts in the cortex of the enormous human brain is dramatically different than found in the much smaller monkey brain: area 10, for instance, occupies a much greater percentage of the cortex in man. But these effects seem to reflect expansion according to rules embedded in a conserved brain plan rather than selection for the specific pattern found in humans (Finlay et al., 2001).</p>
<p>‚Ä¶But our argument here is that these expanded cortical areas are likely to use generic network designs shared by most primates; if so, then it appears unlikely that the designs are in any sense ‚Äòoptimized‚Äô for cognition. We take this as a starting position for the assumption that the designs are far from being maximally effective for specialized human functions, and therefore that it is realistic to expect that cognition-related operations can be significantly enhanced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would agree that the human brain‚Äôs architecture does not seem to be optimal in any universal sense; and that this would constitute an interesting argument if one were arguing that artificial intelligences will not inherently be limited to a level of intelligence comparable to the greatest human geniuses.</p>
<p>However, this does <em>not</em> offer hope for nootropics because the human brain can easily be suboptimal in its gross anatomical architecture but close to optimal in any factor easily tweaked by chemicals! (A suggestion that brain region size is suboptimal is a suggestion only that a large change in brain region size might lead to large gains - but large changes are neither easy, simple, nor possible currently.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Bostrom‚Äôs criteria are more general, so we‚Äôll use them.</p>
<p>Birth control is a clear example of satisfying loophole #2, ‚Äòvalue discordance‚Äô. Ovulation is under the body‚Äôs control and is linked in evolutionary psychology to many changes in behavior; unprocreative sex is common throughout the animal kingdom where it serves other purposes like forming social connections in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonobo" title="Wikipedia: bonobo">bonobo</a> troupes. Hunter-gatherer women practice spaced births by letting their child suckle them for years; maternal cannibalism has been observed when mothers are under particular stress (and perhaps also in humans). So, it‚Äôs clear that there is birth control capability already available to hominids, and not too surprising that it‚Äôs possible to render a healthy woman entirely infertile without major health consequences. Many women would prefer evolution have done just this! They do not value having a dozen children while young; they would rather have just 2 at a time of their choosing - if any at all. Why is evolution not so obliging? Well, it obviously would not be very reproductively fit‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Pacemakers are an example of #3: evolution couldn‚Äôt afford to engineer more reliable hearts, in part for lack of electronic microchips and possibly because humans are already at the limits of the performance envelope<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>.</p>

<p>How about supplements? Most supplements are just tweaking biochemical processes, and don‚Äôt obviously fall under 1, 2, or 3; and the few which seem to enhance healthy humans are finicky creatures (see my introduction to <a href="Nootropics" title="Go to wiki page: Nootropics">Nootropics</a>). <a href="Melatonin" title="Go to wiki page: Melatonin">Melatonin</a>, for example, may seem particularly questionable as one‚Äôs body secretes considerable quantities in an intricate cycle (but <a href="#melatonin">see later</a>).</p>
<section id="flynn-effect" class="level4">
<h4>Flynn effect</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%20effect" title="Wikipedia: Flynn effect">Flynn effect</a> is a possible counter-example: it operates broadly over many countries, improves average IQ by perhaps 10 or more points over the last century<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>, presumably is environmental, and operates without any explicit expensive eugenics programs or anything like that.</p>
<p>However, there are several ways in which the Flynn effect respects Algernon‚Äôs argument and passes the loopholes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the Flynn effect is limited in its gains and so will result in not major gains</p>
the Flynn effect has already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%20effect%23Possible%20end%20of%20progression" title="Wikipedia: Flynn effect#Possible end of progression">stopped in 3 of the wealthiest countries</a> and reversed to some degree. The situation in the US is unclear, but given the outright losses in verbal &amp; science skills seen <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/56143/the-flynn-effect-puzzle_0.pdf" title="'The Flynn effect puzzle: A 30-year examination from the right tail of the ability distribution provides some missing pieces', Wai &amp; Putallaz">1981-2010 in the most intelligent of Midwestern students</a><a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>, this is consistent with a Flynn effect operating through eliminating deficiencies &amp; improving the lower end or with a Flynn effect that has ceased to exist</li>
<li><p>the Flynn effect is apparently environmental, and one of the most plausible explanations is that it is due to either nutritional deficits or public health interventions against infectious diseases.</p>
In neither case are interventions ‚Äòeasy‚Äô in any sense, nor are the interventions available to evolution - if one‚Äôs diet is lacking in an essential element like <a href="Iodine">iodine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine%20deficiency" title="Wikipedia: Iodine deficiency">deficiency</a>, evolution cannot simply conjure it away; nor can it invent any better immune systems than it already has as part of the usual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%20Queen%27s%20Hypothesis" title="Wikipedia: Red Queen's Hypothesis">arms race</a> with infectious agents. As we already noted, we could expect nutritional interventions to produce small benefits, and we might expect that implementing a whole battery of possible improvements (iodine deficiency, <a href="http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=pjbs.2008.1398.1400" title="'The Effect of Iron Deficiency Anemia on Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in under 17 Years Old Students', Goudarzi et al 2008">iron</a> <a href="http://www.idpas.org/pdf/515ReviewofStudies.pdf" title="'A Review of Studies on the Effect of Iron Deficiency on Cognitive Development in Children', McGregor &amp; Ani 2001">deficiency</a>, a dozen childhood infections etc) to produce much what we see with the Flynn effect. But we would expect the gains to be specific and quickly exhausted once the low-hanging fruit is exhausted. (There cannot be indefinitely many deficiencies and infections!) This too is what we observe with the halting of the Flynn effect.</li>
<li>The intelligence gains from the Flynn effect may not be reproductive-fitness-increasing; IQ correlates strongly with many desirable things like income, happiness, knowledge, education, etc. - but not having more than average children. The correlations are found both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility%20and%20intelligence%23Later%20research" title="Wikipedia: Fertility and intelligence#Later research">in the West</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility%20and%20intelligence%23International%20research" title="Wikipedia: Fertility and intelligence#International research">worldwide</a>. (It is of course possible that the Flynn effect causes IQ gains and reproductive fitness increases on the lower end of the spectrum and high IQ is intrinsically reproductive-fitness-reducing in the modern environment, but the observation is suggestive.)</li>
<li><p>the Flynn effect does not actually reflect intelligence gains but damage to the validity of the subtest in which the gains appear, and is irrelevant</p></li>

<section id="piracetam" class="level4">
<h4>Piracetam</h4>
<p>Or in <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/xd/growing_up_is_hard/">‚ÄúGrowing up is hard‚Äù</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer%20Yudkowsky" title="Wikipedia: Eliezer Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> remarks that Bostrom‚Äôs EOC is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶one reason to be wary of, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cholinergic" title="Wikipedia: cholinergic">cholinergic</a> memory enhancers [such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piracetam" title="Wikipedia: piracetam">piracetam</a>]: if they have no downsides, why doesn‚Äôt the brain produce more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acetylcholine" title="Wikipedia: acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a> already? Maybe you‚Äôre using up a limited memory capacity, or forgetting something else‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let‚Äôs consider the specific case of piracetam. Piracetam is so old and has so many studies on its efficacy (real if not substantial) and safety (utterly) that it screens off a lot of secondary considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Might piracetam escape the EOC with #3?</p>
No. Whatever receptors or buttons piracetam pushes could already be pushed by the brain the usual way. There is nothing novel about piracetam in that sense.</li>
<li><p>Might piracetam escape the EOC with #2?</p>
Perhaps. Hard to see how piracetam trades off reproductive fitness for something else, though. Since its synthesis in 1964, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam%23Side%20effects" title="Wikipedia: Piracetam#Side effects">minimal side-effects</a> or other safety issues have been noted, unlike other drugs such as caffeine or aspirin.</li>
<li><p>Might piracetam escape the EOC with #1?</p>
<p>Probably. Many tradeoffs are different in contemporary First World countries than in the proverbial Stone Age veldt. We should look more closely at what piracetam does and what tradeoffs it may be changing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A ‚Äòcholinergic‚Äô operates by encouraging higher levels of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter; acetylcholine is one of the most common neurotransmitters. If serotonin is loosely associated with mood, we might say that acetylcholine is loosely associated with the ‚Äòvelocity‚Äô of thoughts in the brain. If one is using more acetylcholine, one needs to create more acetylcholine (the brain cannot borrow indefinitely like the US federal government). Acetylcholine is made out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/essential%20nutrient" title="Wikipedia: essential nutrient">essential nutrient</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/choline" title="Wikipedia: choline">choline</a>.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about piracetam use is that it doesn‚Äôt do very much by itself<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a>. It is charitably described as ‚Äòsubtle‚Äô. The standard advice is to take a choline supplement with the piracetam: a gram of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soy%20lecithin" title="Wikipedia: soy lecithin">soy lecithin</a>, choline bitartrate, or choline citrate.</p>
<p>Isn‚Äôt this interesting? Presumably we are not Irish peasants consuming wretched diets of potato, potato, and more potato, with some mutton on the holidays. We are cognizant of how a good diet &amp; exercise are prerequisites to brain power. Yet, a gram of straight choline still boosts piracetam‚Äôs effects from subtle or placebo, to noticeable &amp; measurable.</p>
<p>This suggests that perhaps a normal First World diet is choline-deficient. If even well-fed humans must economize on choline &amp; acetylcholine, then surely our ancestors, who were worse off nutritionally, had to economize even more severely. Evolution would frown on squandering acetylcholine on idle thoughts like ‚Äòwhat was that witty saying by Ugh the other day?‚Äô That choline might be needed in the next famine! This suggestion is buttressed by one small mouse experiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Administering choline supplementation to pregnant rats improved the performance of their pups, apparently as a result of changes in neural development in turn due to changes in <em>gene expression</em> (<a href="http://onesci.com/journals/science_journal_87.pdf" title="Prenatal and postnatal choline supplementation produces long-term facilitation of spatial memory">Meck et al. 1988</a>; <a href="http://onesci.com/journals/science_journal_90.pdf" title="Metabolic imprinting of choline by its availability during gestation: implications for memory and attentional processing across the lifespan">Meck &amp; Williams 2003</a>; <a href="http://www.fasebj.org/content/18/3/545.full" title="Prenatal choline supplementation advances hippocampal development and enhances MAPK and CREB activation">Mellott et al. 2004</a>). Given the ready availability of choline supplements, such prenatal enhancement, may already (inadvertently) be taking place in human populations. Supplementation of a mother‚Äôs diet during late and 3 months postpartum with long-chained fatty acids has also been demonstrated to improve cognitive performance in human children (<a href="http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/111/1/e39.full" title="Maternal Supplementation With Very-Long-Chain n-3 Fatty Acids During Pregnancy and Lactation Augments Children's IQ at 4 Years of Age">Helland et al. 2003</a><a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>).<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Past our embryo-hood, we can‚Äôt tell our bodies that we have available as much choline as it could possibly need, that we value our synapses blazing at every moment more than a better chance of surviving a famine (which effectively no longer exist). So we have to override it, for our own good.</p>
<p>(It‚Äôs worth noting here that there is considerable overlap between #1 and #2. Whether you see piracetam as a conflict in values between evolution‚Äôs worst-case planning and our desire for greater average or peak performance, or as a shift in optimal expenditure based on a historical drop in the cost of bulk quantities of choline, is a matter of preference.)</p>

<section id="melatonin" class="level4">
<h4>Melatonin</h4>
<p>How about <a href="Melatonin">melatonin</a>? It is a clear-cut example of failing #3, but perhaps it passes under #1 like piracetam?</p>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shift%20worker" title="Wikipedia: shift worker">shift worker</a> is an obvious case of value discordance: humans are meant to work mostly during the day, with minimal dangerous night-time activity.

Evolution wots not of your ‚Äòemployment contract‚Äô, pitiful human!</p>
<p>Regular people have a less extreme version of the shift worker‚Äôs dilemma. The modern population doesn‚Äôt rise and set with the sun, for imponderable reasons. (My personal theory is widespread <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akrasia" title="Wikipedia: akrasia">akrasia</a></em>: darkness overcomes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperbolic%20discounting" title="Wikipedia: hyperbolic discounting">hyperbolic discounting</a> and forced the ancients to bed, but we have electric lighting and can stay up indefinitely.) This leads to a values mismatch, and a similar solution.</p>

<section id="modafinil" class="level4">
<h4>Modafinil</h4>
<p><a href="Modafinil" title="Go to wiki page: Modafinil">Modafinil</a> is another drug that seems suspiciously like a free lunch. The <a href="Modafinil#side-effects">side-effects</a> are minimal and rare, and the benefit quite unusual and striking: not needing to sleep for a night. The research on general cognitive benefits is mixed but real<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>. (My own <a href="Nootropics#armodafinil">experience with armodafinil</a> was that after 41 hours of sleep-deprivation, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working%20memory" title="Wikipedia: working memory">working memory</a> and focus were actually <em>better</em> than normal as judged by <a href="DNB%20FAQ">dual n-back</a> scores! An anomaly, but still curious.) Yes, modafinil costs money, but that‚Äôs not really relevant to our health or to Evolution. Yes, there is, anecdotally, a risk of coming to <a href="Modafinil#tolerance">tolerate</a> modafinil (although no addiction), but again that doesn‚Äôt matter to Evolution - there would still be benefits before the tolerance kicked in.</p>
<p>What heuristic might we use?</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemically, modafinil does not seem to be so bizarre that evolution could not stumble across it or an equivalent mechanism, so probably we cannot appeal to #3, ‚Äúevolutionary restrictions‚Äù. Its mechanism is not very clear, but mostly seems to manipulate things like the histamine system (and to a much lesser extent, dopamine), all things Evolution could easily do.</li>
<li><p>Nor is it clear what value discordance might be involved. We could come up with one, though.</p>
If one theorized that modafinil came with a memory penalty, inasmuch as memory consolidation and the hippocampus seem to intimately involve sleep, then we might have a discordance where we value being able to produce and act more than being able to remember things. This might even be a sensible tradeoff for a modern man: <em>why not</em> sacrifice some ability to learn or remember long-term, since you can immediately gain back that capacity and more by suitable use of efficient memory techniques like <a href="Spaced%20repetition">spaced repetition</a>?</li>
<li><p>#1 seems promising. Like piracetam, there <em>is</em> something in short supply that modafinil would use more of: calories! While you are awake, you are burning more calories than while asleep. During the day, synapses <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2715914/" title="'Widespread Changes in Synaptic Markers as a Function of Sleep and Wakefulness in Drosophila', Gilestro et al 2009">build up levels of some proteins</a>, which get wiped out by sleep; is this because synapses and memories are expensive<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and cannot be allowed to consume ever more resources without some sort of ‚Äò<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage%20collection%20%28computer%20science%29" title="Wikipedia: Garbage collection (computer science)">garbage collection</a>‚Äô, <a href="http://tononi.psychiatry.wisc.edu/pubs/BRB-62-143-03.pdf" title="'Sleep and synaptic homeostasis: a hypothesis', Tononi &amp; Cirelli 2003">synaptic</a> <a href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~mnl/store/TononiCirelli2006a.pdf" title="'Sleep function and synaptic homeostasis', Tononi &amp; Cirelli 2006">homeostasis</a>? <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2715914/" title="'Widespread Changes in Synaptic Markers as a Function of Sleep and Wakefulness in Drosophila', Gilestro et al 2009">Fly</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819325/" title="'Cortical firing and sleep homeostasis', Vyazovskiy 2010 et al">rat</a> <a href="http://www.phys.mcw.edu/documents/Special%20Topics%20Neuroscience%20Fall%202008/Week%205/nat-neuro_2008_nrems-plasticity.pdf" title="'Molecular and electrophysiological evidence for net synaptic potentiation in wake and depression in sleep', Vyazovskiy et al 2008">studies</a> bear out some of the predictions of the model and may lead to interesting new findings<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> (see also <a href="./docs/algernon/2012-bom.pdf" title="Sleep to Upscale, Sleep to Downscale: Balancing Homeostasis and Plasticity">Bom &amp; Feld 2012</a> discussing <a href="./docs/algernon/2012-chauvette.pdf" title="Sleep Oscillations in the Thalamocortical System Induce Long-Term Neuronal Plasticity">Chauvette et al 2012</a>).</p>

<h4>Heroin</h4>
<p>How about opiates? Morphine and other painkillers can easily be justified as evolution not knowing when a knife cut is by a murderous enemy and when it‚Äôs by a kindly surgeon (which didn‚Äôt exist way back when), and choosing to make us err on the side of always feeling pain. But recreational drug abuse?</p>

<h4>Ecstasy</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA" title="Wikipedia: MDMA">MDMA</a> is another popular illicit drug. Reading <a href="http://www.matthewklam.com/nonfiction/ecstasy.html" title="Experiencing Ecstasy: How Bad It Is to Be 20 Years Old', Klam 2001">accounts of early MDMA use</a> or studies on its beneficial psychological properties (a bit like those claimed for previous psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin), one is struck by how <em>fear</em> seems to be a common trait - or rather, the lack of fear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Ecstasy, I had simply stepped outside the worn paths in my brain and, in the process, gained some perspective on my life. It was an amazing feeling. Small inconsistencies became obvious. ‚ÄúI need money, I have a $500 motorcycle that I‚Äôm too scared to ride, so why not sell it?‚Äù So did big psychological ones: ‚ÄúThe more angry I am at myself, the more critical I am of my girlfriend. Why should I care how Carol chews her gum?‚Äù Ecstasy nudges you to think, very deeply, about one thing at a time. (It wasn‚Äôt that harsh LSD feeling, where every thought seems like an absurd paradox - like the fact that we‚Äôre all, deep down, just a bunch of monkeys.)..A government-approved study in Spain has just begun in which Ecstasy is being offered to treat rape victims for whom no treatment has worked, based on the premise that MDMA ‚Äúreduces the fear response to a perceived emotional threat‚Äù in therapy sessions. A Swiss study in 1993 yielded positive anecdotal evidence on its effect on people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. And a study in California may soon begin in which Ecstasy is administered to end-stage cancer patients suffering from depression, existential crises and chronic pain. The F.D.A. will be reviewing the protocol for Stage 2 of the trial; results are expected in 2002.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading, I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of the popular self-help practice ‚Äú<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rejection%20therapy" title="Wikipedia: rejection therapy">rejection therapy</a>‚Äù (an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exposure%20therapy" title="Wikipedia: exposure therapy">exposure therapy</a>), elements of which reappear among businessmen/entrepreneurs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pick%20up%20artists" title="Wikipedia: pick up artists">pick up artists</a>, shyness therapists<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22rejection%20therapy%22%20site%3Alesswrong.com" title="Rejection therapy on LessWrong.com">nerds</a>, and others: one goes out in public and makes small harmless requests of various strangers until one is no longer uncomfortable or afraid. Eventually one realizes that it is harmless to ask - the worst that will happen is they will say no - and one will presumably be more confident, less fearful, happy, and effective a person. What is the justification for this? After all, one doesn‚Äôt regard being afraid of, say, snake venom as a problem and a good reason to undertake a long regimen of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridatism" title="Wikipedia: Mithridatism">Mithridatism</a>! Snake venom is dangerous and should be feared, and deliberating destroying one‚Äôs useful fear would be like a mouse doing ‚Äòcat therapy‚Äô.</p>
<p>Rejection therapy fans argue that there <em>is</em> a mismatch between fear and reality: our fears and social anxiety are calibrated for the world of a few centuries ago where &gt;90% of the world lived on farms and villagers where a poor reputation &amp; social rejection could mean death; while in the modern world, social rejection is a mere inconvenience because even if one is rejected by one‚Äôs extended circle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s%20number" title="Wikipedia: Dunbar's number">150 people</a> there are 100x more people in a small town, and even more thousands of times more people in a city (to say nothing of a megalopolis like New York City where the numbers get vague into the millions). Risk-taking behavior which is optimal in the village will be ludicrously conservative and inefficient in the big city.</p>
<p>If this theory were correct (it is possible but far from proven), and if MDMA worked the same way (unlikely), then we have a clear example of #1, ‚Äúchanged tradeoffs‚Äù: we are too <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk%20aversion" title="Wikipedia: Risk aversion">risk-averse</a> and fearful of social sanction for a modern environment. (Curiously, this is also a proposed explanation for the apparent increase in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychopathy" title="Wikipedia: psychopathy">psychopathy</a> in modern societies: psychopaths are ‚Äú<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s%20dilemma" title="Wikipedia: Prisoner's dilemma">defectors</a>‚Äù or ‚Äú<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken%20%28game%29" title="Wikipedia: Chicken (game)">hawk</a>‚Äù who would normally be suppressed or less fit in a tightly-networked tribe or village, but can thrive in the reputation-poor modern world as they move from place to place and social circle to social circle, leaving behind their victims.<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The human body is a frugal contractor. It keeps the muscles and skeleton as strong as they need to be, no more and no less. ‚ÄúUse it or lose it‚Äù is a basic mantra of the human body. If you take up jogging or gain thirty pounds, your body will strengthen your bones and muscles as needed. Quit jogging or lose the thirty pounds, and your frame will be appropriately downsized. Muscle is regained in a matter of weeks once astronauts return to earth (and bed-resters get out of bed), but bone takes three to six months to recover. Some studies suggest that the skeletons of astronauts on long-duration missions never quite recover, and for this reason it‚Äôs bone that gets the most study at places like FARU.</p>
<p>The body‚Äôs foreman on call is a cell called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osteocyte" title="Wikipedia: osteocyte">osteocyte</a>, embedded all through the matrix of the bone. Every time you go for a run or lift a heavy box, you cause minute amounts of damage to your bone. The osteocytes sense this and send in a repair team: osteoclasts to remove the damaged cells, and osteoblasts to patch the holes with fresh ones. The repaving strengthens the bone. This is why bone-jarring exercise like jogging is recommended to beef up the balsa-wood bones of thin, small-boned women of northern European ancestry, whose genetics, postmenopause, will land them on the short list for hip replacement.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you stop jarring and stressing your bones - by going into space, or into a wheelchair or a bed-rest study - this cues the strain-sensing osteoclasts to have bone taken away. The human organism seems to have a penchant for streamlining. Whether it‚Äôs muscle or bone, the body tries not to spend its resources on functions that aren‚Äôt serving any purpose.</p>
<p>Tom Lang, a bone expert at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied astronauts, explained all this to me. He told me that a German doctor named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius%20Wolff" title="Wikipedia: Julius Wolff">Wolff</a> figured it out in the 1800s by studying X-rays of infants‚Äô hips as they transitioned from crawling to walking. ‚ÄúA whole new evolution of bone structure takes place to support the mechanical loads associated with walking,‚Äù said Lang. ‚ÄúWolff had the great insight that form follows function.‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>
<p>How bad can it get? If you stay off your feet indefinitely, will your body completely dismantle your skeleton? Can humans become jellyfish by never getting up? They cannot. Paraplegics eventually lose from 1/3 to 1/2 of their bone mass in the lower body. Computer modeling done by Dennis Carter and his students at Stanford University suggests that a two-year mission to Mars would have about the same effect on one‚Äôs skeleton. Would an astronaut returning from Mars run the risk of stepping out of the capsule into Earth gravity and snapping a bone? Carter thinks so. It makes sense, given that extremely osteoporotic women have been known to break a hip (actually, the top of the thighbone where it enters the pelvis) by doing nothing but shifting their weight while standing. They don‚Äôt fall and break a bone; they break a bone and fall. And these women have typically lost a good deal less than 50% of their bone mass.</p>

While there has been an abundance of data linking longevity with reduced fertility in lower life forms, human data have been conflicting. We assessed this tradeoff in a cohort of genetically and socially homogeneous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi" title="Wikipedia: Ashkenazi">Ashkenazi</a> Jewish centenarians (average age ~100 years). As compared with an Ashkenazi cohort without exceptional longevity, our centenarians had fewer children (2.01 vs 2.53, p&lt;0.0001), were older at first childbirth (28.0 vs 25.6, p&lt;0.0001), and at last childbirth (32.4 vs 30.3, p&lt;0.0001). The smaller number of children was observed for male and female centenarians alike. The lower number of children in both genders together with the pattern of delayed reproductive maturity is suggestive of constitutional factors that might enhance human life span at the expense of reduced reproductive ability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Resources allocated to forming true beliefs are resources unavailable for making sperm or eggs, or fighting off the effects of aging by repairing damaged tissues. Modern humans in first-world countries lead a sheltered life and it is hard for us to appreciate just how direct these trade-offs can be. A dramatic example comes from a small Australian mammal, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown%20Antechinus" title="Wikipedia: Brown Antechinus">Brown Antechinus</a> (<em>Antechinus Stuartii</em>). In this and several related species a short, frenzied mating season is followed by a period during which the male‚Äôs sexual organs regress and their immune system collapses. Then all the males in the population die. The Antechinus has little chance of surviving to the next breeding season and so it allocates all of its resources to the reproductive effort and none to tissue maintenance. There can be little doubt that if, like us, the Antechinus had a massively hypertrophied cortex and engaged in a lot of costly thinking, it would allow that neural tissue to decay in the mating season so as to allocate more resources to sperm production and sexual competition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some years ago I drew attention to the ‚Äúparadox of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/placebos" title="Wikipedia: placebos">placebos</a>‚Äù, a paradox that must strike any evolutionary biologist who thinks about it. It‚Äôs this. When a person‚Äôs health improves under the influence of placebo medication, then, as we‚Äôve noted already, this has to be a case of ‚Äúself-cure‚Äù. But if people have the capacity to heal themselves by their own efforts, why not get on with it as soon as needed? Why wait for permission - from a sugar pill, a witch doctor - that it‚Äôs time to get better?</p>
<p>Presumably the explanation must be that self-cure has <em>costs</em> as well as benefits. What kind of costs are these? Well, actually they‚Äôre fairly obvious. Many of the illnesses we experience, like pain, fever and so on, are actually defenses which are designed to stop us from getting into more trouble than we‚Äôre already in. So ‚Äúcuring‚Äù ourselves of these defenses can indeed cost us down the line. Pain reduces our mobility, for example, and stops us from harming ourselves further; so, relieving ourselves of pain is actually quite risky. Fever helps kill bacterial parasites by raising body temperature to a level they can‚Äôt tolerate; so again, curing ourselves of fever <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4384/is_3_38/ai_n29083511/">is risky</a>. Vomiting gets rid of toxins; so suppressing vomiting is risky. The same goes for the deployment of the immune system. Mounting an immune response is energetically expensive. Our metabolic rate rises 15% or so, even if we‚Äôre just responding to a common cold. What‚Äôs more, when we make antibodies we use up rare nutrients that will later have to be replaced. Given these costs, it becomes clear that immediate self-cure from an occurrent illness is not always a wise thing to do. In fact there will be circumstances when it would be best to <em>hold back</em> from deploying particular healing measures because the anticipated benefits are not likely to exceed the anticipated costs. In general it will be wise to err on side of caution, <em>to play safe</em>, not to let down our defenses such as pain or fever until we see signs that the danger has passed, not to use up our stock of ammunition against parasites until we know we‚Äôre in relatively good shape and there‚Äôs not still worse to come. Healing ourselves involves - or ought to involve - a judgment call‚Ä¶There‚Äôs plenty of evidence that we have just such a system at work overseeing our health. For example, in winter, we are cautious about deploying our immune resources. That‚Äôs why a cold lasts much longer in winter than it does in summer. It‚Äôs not because we‚Äôre cold, it‚Äôs because our bodies, based on deep evolutionary history reckon that it‚Äôs not so safe to use our immune resources in winter, as it would be in summer. There‚Äôs experimental confirmation of this in animals. Suppose a hamster is injected with bacteria which makes it sick - but in one case the hamster is on an artificial day/night cycle that suggests it‚Äôs summer; in the other case it‚Äôs on a cycle that suggests it‚Äôs winter. If the hamster is tricked into thinking it‚Äôs summer, it throws everything it has got against the infection and recovers completely. If it thinks it‚Äôs winter then it just mounts a holding operation, as if it‚Äôs waiting until it knows it‚Äôs safe to mount a full-scale response. The hamster ‚Äúthinks‚Äù this or that?? No, of course it doesn‚Äôt think it consciously - the light cycle acts as a subconscious prime to the hamster‚Äôs health management system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humphrey also goes on to point out that exploiting the placebo effect satisfies one of Bostrom‚Äôs <a href="#loopholes">EOC criteria</a> (which we haven‚Äôt discussed yet):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, as I said, the world has changed - or at least <em>is changing</em> for most of us. We no longer live in such an oppressive environment. We no longer need to play by the old rules, and rein in our peculiar strengths and idiosyncrasies. We can afford to take risks now we couldn‚Äôt before. So, yes, I‚Äôm hopeful. I think it really ought to be possible to devise placebo treatments for the self, which do indeed induce them to come out from their protective shells - and so to emerge as happier, nicer, cleverer, more creative people than they would ever otherwise have dared to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The disappearance of the fear memory suggested that every time we think about the past we are delicately transforming its cellular representation in the brain, changing its underlying neural circuitry. It was a stunning discovery: Memories are not formed and then pristinely maintained, as neuroscientists thought; they are formed and then rebuilt every time they‚Äôre accessed. ‚ÄúThe brain isn‚Äôt interested in having a perfect set of memories about the past,‚Äù LeDoux says. ‚ÄúInstead, memory comes with a natural updating mechanism, which is how we make sure that the information taking up valuable space inside our head is still useful. That might make our memories less accurate, but it probably also makes them more relevant to the future.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Ä¶What does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKMzeta" title="Wikipedia: PKMzeta">PKMzeta</a> do? The molecule‚Äôs crucial trick is that it increases the density of a particular type of sensor called an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPA%20receptor" title="Wikipedia: AMPA receptor">AMPA receptor</a> on the outside of a neuron. It‚Äôs an ion channel, a gateway to the interior of a cell that, when opened, makes it easier for adjacent cells to excite one another. (While neurons are normally shy strangers, struggling to interact, PKMzeta turns them into intimate friends, happy to exchange all sorts of incidental information.) This process requires constant upkeep - every long-term memory is always on the verge of vanishing. As a result, even a brief interruption of PKMzeta activity can dismantle the function of a steadfast circuit. If the genetic expression of PKMzeta is amped up - by, say, genetically engineering rats to overproduce the stuff - they become mnemonic freaks, able to convert even the most mundane events into long-term memory. (Their performance on a standard test of recall is nearly double that of normal animals.) Furthermore, once neurons begin producing PKMzeta, the protein tends to linger, marking the neural connection as a memory. ‚ÄúThe molecules themselves are always changing, but the high level of PKMzeta stays constant,‚Äù Sacktor says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes the endurance of the memory possible.‚Äù For example, in a recent experiment, Sacktor and scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science trained rats to associate the taste of saccharin with nausea (thanks to an injection of lithium). After just a few trials, the rats began studiously avoiding the artificial sweetener. All it took was a single injection of a PKMzeta inhibitor called zeta-interacting protein, or ZIP, before the rats forgot all about their aversion. The rats went back to guzzling down the stuff.</p>

<p>If better memory, for example, is unequivocally beneficial, why do seemingly trivial neuromolecular changes that would enhance memory, such as the over-expression of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus (Tang et al., 1999), not (to our knowledge) exist in natural populations? If it is so easy to evolve superior cognitive capacities, why aren‚Äôt we smarter already?</p>

<p>The memory profile displayed by the now qualified trainees mirrors exactly the pattern displayed in several previous cross-sectional studies of licensed London taxi drivers [3, 4, 20] (and that which normalized in the retired taxi drivers [21]). In those studies also, the taxi drivers displayed more knowledge of the spatial relationships between landmarks in London, unsurprisingly, given their increased exposure to the city compared to control participants. By contrast, this enhanced spatial representation of the city was accompanied by poorer performance on a complex figure test, a visuospatial task designed to assess the free recall of visual material after 30 min. Our findings therefore not only replicate those of previous cross-sectional studies but extend them by showing the change in memory profile within the same participants.

<p>The benefits of limited memory have also been proposed to explain the curious constraints on working-memory span to a limited number of information chunks (for several related examples, see <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~abcwest/pmwiki/pdf/hertwig.thinkingpsypatterns.2003.pdf" title="More is not always better: The benefits of cognitive limits">Hertwig &amp; Todd, 2003</a>)‚Ä¶As an example, working memory is correlated with performance on many cognitive tasks, such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test. However, individuals with high working-memory capacity often fail to hear their own name in a cocktail-party task and recall fewer items from a list after experiencing a context change (see <a href="http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/neuro/The%20nature%20of%20individual%20differences%20in%20working%20memory%20capacity%20-%20active%20maintenance%20in%20primary%20memory%20and%20controlled%20search%20from%20secondary%20memory.pdf" title="The nature of individual differences in working memory capacity: Active maintenance in primary memory and controlled search from secondary memory">Unsworth &amp; Engle, 2007</a>).

<blockquote>
<p>Somatic maintenance needs only to be good enough to keep the organism in sound physiological condition for as long as it has a reasonable chance of survival in the wild. For example, since more than 90% of wild mice die in their first year (<a href="./docs/algernon/1989-phelan.pdf" title="Natural selection, dietary restriction, and extended longevity">Phelan and Austad, 1989</a>), any investment of energy in mechanisms for survival beyond this age benefits at most 10% of the population. Nearly all of the mechanisms required for somatic maintenance and repair (DNA repair, antioxidant systems, etc.) require [substantial] amounts of energy (ATP). Energy is scarce, as shown by the fact that the major cause of mortality for wild mice is cold, due to failure to maintain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thermogenesis" title="Wikipedia: thermogenesis">thermogenesis</a> (<a href="./docs/algernon/1992-berry.pdf" title="Life history and bioeconomy of the house mouse">Berry and Bronson, 1992</a>). The mouse will therefore benefit by investing any spare energy into thermogenesis or reproduction, rather than into better capacity for somatic maintenance and repair, even though this means that damage will eventually accumulate to cause aging. The three-year lifespan potential of the mouse is sufficient for its actual needs in the wild, and yet it is not excessive, given that some mice will survive into their second year and that age-related deterioration will become apparent before maximum life span potential is reached. Thus, it makes sense to suppose that the intrinsic life span of the mouse has been optimized to suit its ecology. The idea that intrinsic longevity is tuned to the prevailing level of extrinsic mortality is supported by extensive observations on natural populations (<a href="./docs/algernon/1998-ricklefs.pdf">Ricklefs, 1998</a>). Evolutionary adaptations such as flight, protective shells, and large brains, all of which tend to reduce extrinsic mortality, are associated with increased longevity.</p>

This may be vindicated by looking at the influence of genes on the two different categories. From Stanovich 2010, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rationality-Reflective-Mind-Keith-Stanovich/dp/0195341147/?tag=gwernnet-20"><em>Rationality &amp; The Reflective Mind</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For many years, evolutionary psychology had little to say about individual differences because the field had as a foundational assumption that natural selection would eliminate heritable differences because heritable traits would be driven to fixation (Buss, 2009 [<em>The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology</em>]). recently however, evolutionary psychologists have attempted to explain the contrary evidence that virtually all cognitive and personality traits that have been measured have heritabilities hovering around 50%. <a href="http://www.unm.edu/~gfmiller/newpapers_sept6/penke%202007%20targetarticle.pdf" title="The evolutionary genetics of personality">Penke, Denissen, &amp; Miller 2007</a> have proposed a theory that explains these individual differences. Interestingly, the theory accounts for heritable cognitive ability differences in a different way than it accounts for heritable cognitive thinking dispositions and personality variables. the basis of their theory is a distinction that I will be stressing throughout this book - that between typical performance indicators and optimal performance indicators.</p>
<p>Penke et al (2007) argue that ‚Äúthe classical distinction between cognitive abilities and personality traits is much more than just a historical convention or a methodological matter of different measurement approaches (Cronbach, 1949 [<em>Essentials of Psychological Testing</em>]), and instead reflects different kinds of selection pressures that have shaped distinctive genetic architectures for these two classes‚Äù (p.550) of individual differences. On their view, personality traits and thinking dispositions (reflective-level individual differences) represent preserved, heritable variability that is maintained by different biological processes than intelligence (algorithmic-level individual differences). Thinking dispositions and personality traits are maintained by balanced selection, most probably frequency-dependent selection (Buss, 2009). The most famous example of the latter is cheater-based personality traits that flourish when they are rare but become less adaptive as the proportion of cheaters in the population rises (as cheaters begin to heat each other), finally reaching an equilibrium.</p>
<p>In contrast, variability in intelligence is thought to be maintained by constant changes in mutation load (Buss, 2009; Penke et al, 2007). As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/magazine/11Genome-t.html?pagewanted=all" title="My Genome, My Self">Pinker (2009 pg46)</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶new mutations creep into the genome faster than natural selection can weed them out. At any given moment, the population is laden with a portfolio of recent mutations, each of whose days are numbered. This Sisyphean struggle between selection and mutation is common with traits that depend on many genes, because there are so many things that can go wrong‚Ä¶Unlikely personality, where it takes all kinds to make a world, with intelligence, smarter is simply better, so balancing selection is unlikely. But intelligence depends on a large network of brain areas, and it thrives in a body that is properly nourished and free of diseases and defects‚Ä¶Mutations in general are far more likely to be harmful than helpful, and the large, helpful ones were low-hanging fruit that were picked long ago in our evolutionary history and entrenched in the species‚Ä¶But as the barrel gets closer to the target, smaller and smaller tweaks are needed to bring any further improvement‚Ä¶Though we know that genes for intelligence must exist, each is likely to be small in effect, found in only a few people, or both [In a recent study of 6,000 children, the gene with the biggest effect accounted for less than one-quarter of an I.Q. point.]‚Ä¶The hunt for personality genes, though not yet Nobel-worthy, has had better fortunes. Several associations have been found between personality traits and genes that govern the breakdown, recycling or detection of neurotransmitters</p>

<li id="fn19"><p>The abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human beings are a marvel of evolved complexity. Such systems can be difficult to enhance. When we manipulate complex evolved systems, which are poorly understood, our interventions often fail or backfire. It can appear as if there is a ‚Äúwisdom of nature‚Äù which we ignore at our peril. Sometimes the belief in nature‚Äôs wisdom - and corresponding doubts about the prudence of tampering with nature, especially human nature - manifest as diffusely moral objections against enhancement. Such objections may be expressed as intuitions about the superiority of the natural or the troublesomeness of hubris, or as an evaluative bias in favor of the status quo. This chapter explores the extent to which such prudence-derived anti-enhancement sentiments are justified. We develop a heuristic, inspired by the field of evolutionary medicine, for identifying promising human enhancement interventions. The heuristic incorporates the grains of truth contained in ‚Äò‚Äônature knows best‚Äô‚Äô attitudes while providing criteria for the special cases where we have reason to believe that it is feasible for us to improve on nature.</p>

<li id="fn20"><p>From the review <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1544/1195.full">‚ÄúThe population genetics of beneficial mutations‚Äù</a>, Orr 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under these so-called strong-selection weak-mutation conditions, the population is essentially made up of a single wild-type DNA sequence‚Ä¶.Each of these [possible] sequences, including the wild-type, is assigned a [reproductive] fitness from some distribution. The key point, however, is that this overall distribution of fitness is unknown. Despite this, we do know two things. First, the wild-type allele is highly fit; indeed it is fitter than all of its <em>m</em> mutant ‚Äúneighbour‚Äù sequences (this is why it is wild-type). Second, any beneficial mutations would be even fitter and so would fall even farther out in the tail of the fitness distribution. (We assume for now that this tail falls off in some ‚Äúordinary‚Äù smooth way; see below.) At some point in time, the environment changes and the wild-type allele slips slightly in fitness and one or more of the <em>m</em> mutations becomes beneficial. The question is: what is the size of the fitness gap between the wild-type and a beneficial sequence?</p>
<p>To answer this, Gillespie assumed that only one beneficial mutation is available. Taking advantage of an obscure part of EVT concerned with ‚Äúextreme spacings‚Äù, he showed that, more or less independently of the shape of the unknown overall distribution of fitness, this fitness gap - the fitness effects of new beneficial mutations - is exponentially distributed. This result was later generalized by Orr (2003) to any modest number of beneficial mutations (i.e.¬†the wild-type sequence might mutate to 5 or 10 or so different beneficial mutations). Mutation should thus often yield beneficial alleles of small effect and rarely yield those of large effect. In retrospect, it is clear that this exponential distribution of beneficial effects is a simple consequence of a well-known result from so-called peaks-over-threshold models in EVT (Leadbetter et al. 1983). A large set of results, concerning both the first substitution during adaptation and the properties of entire adaptive walks to local optima rest on this result (Orr 2002, 2004, 2005; Rokyta et al. 2005)‚Ä¶Unfortunately, the data available thus far from the relevant experiments are mixed.</p>

<p>There is a large and often conflicting literature on the effects of modafinil on components of cognition. Some studies obtained a clear improvement in sustained attention in healthy human subjects (<a href="http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&amp;ID=6624&amp;DocPartID=6148" title="Cognitive effects of modafinil in student volunteers may depend on IQ">Randall et al., 2005</a>) but others failed to find such effects (<a href="./docs/modafinil/2003-turner.pdf" title="Cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil in healthy volunteers">Turner et al., 2003</a>). Similar discrepancies occur in the literature on animals (<a href="./docs/algernon/2005-waters.pdf" title="Assessment of modafinil on attentional processes in a five-choice serial reaction time test in the rat">Waters et al., 2005</a>). A recent, multi-factorial analysis provided convincing evidence that moderate doses of modafinil improve attention in healthy middle-aged rats without affecting motivation or locomotor activity (<a href="./docs/algernon/2007-morgan.pdf" title="Modafinil improves attention, inhibitory control, and reaction time in healthy, middle-aged rats">Morgan et al., 2007</a>). Importantly, these effects became evident only as attentional demands were increased. In all, it seems reasonable at this point to conclude that modafinil‚Äôs effects on basic psychological state variables - wakefulness - can translate into selective improvements in attention.</p>
<p>There is also a sizable literature suggesting that the above conclusion can be extended to memory encoding. An intriguing aspect of these studies in rodents (<a href="./docs/algernon/2002-beracochea.pdf">Beracochea et al., 2002</a>) and humans (Turner et al., 2003; <a href="./docs/modafinil/2004-baranski.pdf" title="Effects of modafinil on cognitive and meta-cognitive performance">Baranski et al., 2004</a>; <a href="http://www-bmu.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/publications/muller04eff.pdf" title="Effects of modafinil on working memory processes in humans">Muller et al., 2004</a>; Randall et al., 2005) is that they generally point to a drug influence on working memory as opposed to the encoding of long-term memory for specific information (<a href="./docs/modafinil/2008-minzenberg.pdf" title="Modafinil: A Review of Neurochemical Actions and Effects on Cognition">Minzenberg and Carter, 2008</a>). (A similar argument was made earlier for Ritalin.) For example, the above noted work on middle-aged rats found no evidence for accelerated acquisition of a visual discrimination problem, with minimal demands on working memory, despite clear improvements in attention. There are, however, studies showing that modafinil accelerates the acquisition of simple rules (‚Äòwin-stay‚Äô) (<a href="./docs/algernon/2003-beracochea.pdf" title="Enhancement of learning processes following an acute modafinil injection in mice">Beracochea et al., 2003</a>), a spatial learning protocol (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884197/" title="Modafinil and memory: Effects of modafinil on Morris water maze learning and Pavlovian fear conditioning">Shuman et al., 2009</a>), and a non-match to position problem (<a href="./docs/algernon/2004-ward.pdf" title="Modafinil facilitates performance on a delayed nonmatching to position swim task in rats">Ward et al., 2004</a>) in rodents. It is tempting to speculate that we are here seeing hierarchical effects of modafinil such that enhanced wakefulness produces greater attention that in turn improves both working memory and simple rule learning.</p>
<p>But does the above sequence in fact improve the integrative psychological processes that constitute cognition? By far the greater part of the human studies with modafinil involves subjects with impairments to performance (sleep deprivation) or psychiatric disorders. None of the animal studies used recently developed tests (see below) that are explicitly intended to assess variables such as recall vs.¬†recognition or ‚Äòtop-down‚Äô forcing of attention. This leaves a small set of experiments involving performance by healthy human subjects on relatively simple learning/perceptual problems. A retrospective analysis of several studies led to the conclusion that modafinil does not produce a ‚Äòglobal‚Äô enhancement of cognition (Randall et al., 2005).</p>

<p>About 40% of the energy requirements of the cerebral cortex - by far the most metabolically expensive tissue in the body - are due to neuronal repolarization following postsynaptic potentials.<sup>67</sup> The higher the synaptic weight impinging on a neuron, the higher this portion of the energy budget. Moreover, increased synaptic weight is thought to lead to increased average firing rates,<sup>68</sup> and spikes in turn are responsible for another 40% of the gray matter energy budget.<sup>67</sup> Therefore, it would seem energetically prohibitive for the brain to let synaptic weight grow without checks as a result of waking plasticity. Indeed, if PET data<sup>11</sup> offer any indication, after just one waking day energy expenditure may grow by as much as 18%.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶Another benefit of synaptic downscaling/downselection during sleep would be in terms of space requirements. Synaptic strengthening is thought to be accompanied by morphological changes, including increased size of terminal boutons and spines, and synapses may even grow in number (e.g.<sup>3,4,63</sup>). But space is a precious commodity in the brain, and even minuscule increases in volume are extremely dangerous. For example, neocortical gray matter is tightly packed, with wiring (axons and dendrites) taking up ~60% of the space, synaptic contacts (boutons and spines) ~20%, and the rest (cell bodies, vessels, extracellular space) the remaining 20%.<sup>69</sup> Thus, sleep would be important not just to keep in check the metabolic cost of strengthened synapses, but also to curb their demands on brain real estate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We propose that the influence of acetylcholine (ACh) may provide a mechanism for both upscaling and downscaling of cortical synapses. Specifically, experimental studies have shown that ACh modulation switches the phase response curves of cortical pyramidal cells from Type II to Type I. Our computational studies of cortical networks show that the presence of ACh induces cellular and network dynamics which lead to net synaptic potentiation under a standard STDP rule, while the absence of ACh alters dynamics in such a way that the same STDP rule leads to net depotentiation (see Fig. 1). Thus the well-established prevalence of ACh in cortical circuits during waking may lead to global synaptic potentiation, while the absence of ACh during NREM sleep may lead to global depotentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ACh is broken down by acetylcholinesterase, and ACh receptors can also be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine%23ACh%20receptor%20antagonists" title="Wikipedia: Acetylcholine#ACh receptor antagonists">blocked by various drugs</a> classified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anticholinergic" title="Wikipedia: anticholinergic">anticholinergic</a>s; anticholinergics like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diphenhydramine" title="Wikipedia: diphenhydramine">diphenhydramine</a> cause sedation, ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù, and have been used to treat insomnia. If the absence of ACh enables the downscaling, could the process be sped up by intervening with such drugs during sleep? Alternately, the theory could be tested by intervening with the opposite drugs and testing how high brain caloric consumption is upon waking. (These would have to be animal studies; drugs like atropine or scopolamine are dangerous to use in humans.)</p>
<p>If this theory is borne out, it may suggest a more precise exception for piracetam or cholinergics in general: increasing potentiation may make the later depotentiation ‚Äútoo expensive‚Äù either energy- or time-wise. Additional predictions may be that: people who are more intelligent (thanks to having ACh upregulated for whatever reason) will need more sleep or energy; use of cholinergics will increase sleep or energy needs in normal people. Retrodictions include babies sleeping a great deal and the elderly sleeping less. (Since memory formation is already strongly linked to sleep and may increase sleep need itself, this is a confound that needs to be taken into account along with others like the major sleep disturbances of the elderly &amp; lack of melatonin secretion.)<a href="#fnref35">‚Ü©</a></p></li>

<p>A bigger, more complex brain may have advantages over a small brain in terms of computing power, but brain expansion has costs. For one thing, a big brain is a metabolic drain on our bodies. Indeed, some people argue that, because the brain is one of the most metabolically expensive tissues in our body, our brains could only have expanded in response to an improved diet. Another cost that goes along with a big brain is the need to reorganise its wiring. ‚ÄúAs brain size increases, several problems are created‚Äù, explains systems neurobiologist Jon Kaas (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States). ‚ÄúThe most serious is the increased time it takes to get information from one place to another.‚Äù One solution is to make the axons of the neurons bigger but this increases brain size again and the problem escalates. Another solution is to do things locally: only connect those parts of the brain that have to be connected, and avoid the need for communication between hemispheres by making different sides of the brain do different things. A big brain can also be made more efficient by organising it into more subdivisions, ‚Äúrather like splitting a company into departments‚Äù, says Kaas. Overall, he concludes, because a bigger brain per se would not work, brain reorganisation and size increase probably occurred in parallel during human brain evolution. The end result is that the human brain is not just a scaled-up version of a mammal brain or even of an ape brain.</p>

<p>Anatomists often resort to allometry when dealing with questions of selective pressures on brain regions. Applied to brain proportions, this involves collecting measurements for the region of interest - e.g., frontal cortex - for a series of animals within a given taxonomic group and then relating it to the volume or weight of the brains of those animals. This can establish with a relatively small degree of error whether a brain component in a particular species is larger than would be predicted from that species‚Äô brain size. While there is not a great deal of evidence, studies of this type point to the conclusion that cortical subdivisions in humans, including association regions, are about as large as expected for an anthropoid primate with a 1350 cm<sup>3</sup> brain. The volume of area 10 of human frontal cortex, for example, fits on the regression line (area 10 vs.¬†whole brain) calculated from published data (<a href="http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~knutson/bad/semendeferi01.pdf" title="Prefrontal Cortex in Humans and Apes: A Comparative Study of Area 10">Semendeferi et al., 2001</a>) for a series composed of gibbons, apes and humans (Lynch and Granger, 2008 [<em>Big brain: the origins and future of human intelligence</em>]). Given that this region is widely assumed to play a central role in executive functions and working memory, these observations do not encourage the idea that selective pressures for cognition have differentially shaped the proportions of human cortex. Importantly, this does not mean that those proportions are in any sense typical. The allometric equations involve different exponents for different regions, meaning that absolute proportions (e.g., primary sensory cortex vs.¬†association cortex) change as brains grow larger. The balance of parts in the cortex of the enormous human brain is dramatically different than found in the much smaller monkey brain: area 10, for instance, occupies a much greater percentage of the cortex in man. But these effects seem to reflect expansion according to rules embedded in a conserved brain plan rather than selection for the specific pattern found in humans (<a href="http://www.anthropology.emory.edu/FACULTY/Rilling/ANTJR/pdf/BBS.pdf" title="Developmental structure in brain evolution">Finlay et al., 2001</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humans also do not rank first, or even close to first, in relative brain size (expressed as a percentage of body mass), in absolute size of the cerebral cortex, or in gyrification (3). At best, we rank first in the relative size of the cerebral cortex expressed as a percentage of brain mass, but not by far. Although the human cerebral cortex is the largest among mammals in its relative size, at 75.5% (4), 75.7% (5), or even 84.0% (6) of the entire brain mass or volume, other animals, primate and nonprimate, are not far behind: The cerebral cortex represents 73.0% of the entire brain mass in the chimpanzee (7), 74.5% in the horse, and 73.4% in the short-finned whale (3).</p>
<p>‚Ä¶If encephalization were the main determinant of cognitive abilities, small-brained animals with very large encephalization quotients, such as capuchin monkeys, should be more cognitively able than large-brained but less encephalized animals, such as the gorilla (2). However, the former animals with a smaller brain are outranked by the latter in cognitive performance (13).</p>
<p>‚Ä¶However, this notion is in disagreement with the observation that animals of similar brain size but belonging to different mammalian orders, such as the cow and the chimpanzee (both at about 400 g of brain mass), or the rhesus monkey and the capybara (at 70-80 g of brain mass), may have strikingly different cognitive abilities and behavioral repertoires.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶Despite common remarks in the literature that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10- to 50-fold more glial cells (e.g., 57-59), no references are given to support these statements; to the best of my knowledge, they are none other than ballpark estimates (60). Comparing the human brain with other mammalian brains thus required first estimating the total numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells that compose these brains, which we did a few years ago (25). Remarkably, at an average of 86 billion neurons and 85 billion nonneuronal cells (25), the human brain has just as many neurons as would be expected of a generic primate brain of its size and the same overall 1:1 nonneuronal/ neuronal ratio as other primates (26). Broken down into the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and rest of the brain, the neuronal scaling rules that apply to primate brains also apply to the human brain (25) (Fig. 3 A and C, arrows). Neuronal densities in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum also fit the expected values in humans as in other primate species (Fig. 3B), and the ratio between nonneuronal and neuronal cells in the whole human brain of 1:1 (not 10:1, as commonly reported) is similar to that of other primates (25). The number of neurons in the gray matter alone of the human cerebral cortex, as well as the size of the subcortical white matter and the number of nonneuronal cells that it contains, also conforms to the rules that apply to other primates analyzed (47). Most importantly, even though the relative expansion of the human cortex is frequently equated with brain evolution, which would have reached its crowning achievement in us (61), the human brain has the ratio of cerebellar to cerebral cortical neurons predicted from other mammals, primate and nonprimate alike (Fig. 4A).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to expectations, dividing total glucose use per minute in the cerebral cortex or whole brain (69) by the number of brain neurons revealed a remarkably constant average glucose use per neuron across the mouse, rat, squirrel, monkey, baboon, and human, with no significant relationship to neuronal density and, therefore, to average neuronal size (70). This is in contrast to the decreasing average metabolic cost of other cell types in mammalian bodies with increasing cell size (71-73), with the single possible exception of muscle fibers (74). The higher levels of expression of genes related to metabolism in human brains compared with chimpanzee and monkey brains (75, 76) might therefore be related not to an actual increase in metabolism per cell but to the maintenance of average neuronal metabolism in the face of decreasing metabolism in other cell types in the body. That the average energetic cost per neuron does not scale with average neuronal cell size has important physiological implications. First, considering the obligatory increased cost related to a larger surface area (68), the evolution of neurons with a constant average energetic cost regardless of their total cell size implies that the relationship between larger neuronal size and a larger G/N ratio must not be related to increased metabolic needs, as usually assumed.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶Second, the constant average energetic cost per neuron across species implies that larger neurons must compensate for the obligatory increased metabolic cost related to repolarizing the increased surface area of the cell membrane. This compensation could be implemented by a decreased number of synapses and/or decreased rates of excitatory synaptic transmission (69). Synaptic homeostasis and elimination of excess synapses [e.g., during sleep (77)], the bases of synaptic plasticity, might thus be necessary consequences of a tradeoff imposed by the need to constrain neuronal energetic expenditure (70). Another consequence of a seemingly constant metabolic cost per neuron across species is that the total metabolic cost of rodent and primate brains, and of the human brain, is a simple, linear function of their total number of neurons (70) (Fig. 6), regardless of average neuronal size, absolute brain size, or relative brain size compared with the body. At an average rate of 6 kcal/d per billion neurons (70), the average human brain, with 86 billion neurons, costs about 516 kcal/d. That this represents an enormous 25% of the total body energetic cost is simply a result of the ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù neuronal scaling rules that apply to primates in comparison to rodents, and probably to other mammals in general</p>
<p>‚Ä¶Growing a large body comes at a cost. Although large animals require less energy per unit of body weight, they have considerably larger total metabolic requirements that, on average, scale with body mass raised to an exponent of ‚àº3/4 (84-87). Thus, large mammals need to eat more, and they cannot concentrate on rare, hard-to-find, or catch foods (88). Adding neurons to the brain, however, also comes at a sizable cost, as reviewed above: 6 kcal/d per billion neurons (70). In primates, whose brain mass scales linearly with its number of neurons, this implies that total brain metabolism scales linearly with brain volume or mass, that is, with an exponent of 1, which is much greater than the much cited 3/4 exponent of Kleiber (84) that relates body metabolism to body mass. The discrepancy suggests that, per gram, the cost of primate brain tissue scales faster than the cost of nonneuronal bodily tissues, which calls for a modification of the ‚Äúexpensive tissue hypothesis‚Äù of brain evolution (89), according to which brain size is a limiting factor. Given the steep, linear increase in brain metabolic cost with increasing numbers of neurons, we conclude that metabolic cost is a more limiting factor to brain expansion than previously suspected. In our view, it is not brain size but, instead, absolute number of neurons that imposes a metabolic constraint on brain scaling in evolution, because individuals with larger numbers of neurons must be able to sustain their proportionately larger metabolic requirements to keep their brain functional. The larger the number of neurons, the higher is the total caloric cost of the brain, and therefore the more time required to be spent feeding to support the brain alone, and feeding can be very time-consuming (90). Based on their brain mass [estimated from cranial capacity (91)], we predicted that total numbers of neurons in the brain increased from 27 to 35 billion neurons in Australopithecus and Paranthropus species to close to 50-60 billion neurons in Homo species from <em>Homo rudolfensis</em> to <em>Homo antecessor</em>, to 62 billion neurons in <em>Homo erectus</em>, and to 76-90 billion neurons in <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em> and <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em> (62), which is within the range of variation found in modern <em>Homo sapiens</em> (25). It can thus be seen how any increase in total numbers of neurons in the evolution of hominins and great apes would have taxed survival in a limiting, if not prohibitive, way, given that it probably would have to occur in a context of already limiting feeding hours: The added 60 billion brain neurons from an orangutan-sized hominin ancestor to modern Homo require an additional 360 kcal/d, which is probably not readily available to great apes on their diet.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that the advent of the ability to control fire to cook foods, which increases enormously the energy yield of foods and the speed with which they are consumed (92, 93), may have been a crucial step in allowing the near doubling of numbers of brain neurons that is estimated to have occurred between H. erectus and H. sapiens (94).</p>

<p>This could have many explanations (perhaps a slow accretion of technology/culture allowed older people to survive with no connection to human biology or evolution), but in this context, I can‚Äôt help but wonder - could old age be increasing because intelligence is <em>so</em> expensive that old age is the only way for the genes to recoup their investments? Or could it be that increases in human intelligence used to pay off within a normal lifespan because the humans learned <em>faster</em>, but now they have reached a limit on their intelligence, how <em>fast</em> they learn, and so to be more effective, the slow learners have to learn for <em>longer</em>?<a href="#fnref46">‚Ü©</a></p></li>

<p>‚Ä¶Wray and his colleagues compared SLC2A1 in humans and other animals. They discovered that our ancestors acquired an unusually high number of mutations in the gene. The best explanation for that accumulation of mutations is that SLC2A1 experienced natural selection in our own lineage, and the new mutations boosted our reproductive success. Intriguingly, the Duke team discovered that the mutations didn‚Äôt alter the shape of the glucose transporters. Rather, they changed stretches of DNA that toggled the SLC2A1 gene on and off.</p>
<p>Wray guessed that these mutations changed the total number of glucose transporters built in the human brain. To test his theory, he looked at slices of human brain tissue. In order to make glucose transporters, the cells must first make copies of the SLC2A1 gene to serve as a template. Wray discovered that in human brains there were 2.5 to 3 times as many copies of SLC2A1 as there were in chimpanzee brains, suggesting the presence of more glucose transporters as well. Then he looked at glucose transporters that deliver the sugar to muscles. The gene for these muscle transporters, called SLC2A4, also underwent natural selection in humans, but in the opposite direction. Our muscles contain fewer glucose transporters than in chimps‚Äô muscles. Wray‚Äôs results support the notion that our ancestors evolved extra molecular pumps to funnel sugar into the brain, while starving muscles by giving them fewer transporters.</p>

Among the Ashkenazi Jews, the average IQ is approximately 0.7 to 1 standard deviation above that of the general European population. Recent evidence indicates that this rise in IQ was the consequence of evolutionary selection for greater intelligence among European Jews over approximately the last 2,000 years.

<p>‚ÄúSagan adopts the principle‚Äùit is better to be smart than to be stupid,&quot; but life on Earth refutes this claim. Among all the forms of life, neither the prokaryotes nor protists, fungi or plants has evolved smartness, as it should have if it were ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù In the 28 plus phyla of animals, intelligence evolved in only one (chordates) and doubtfully also in the cephalopods.

So much for the putative inevitability of the development of high intelligence because ‚Äúit is better to be smart.‚Äù( Mayr 1995b)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶These ancestors and their lineages have continued to exist and evolve and have not produced intelligence. All together that makes about 3 billion years of prokaryotic evolution that did not produce high intelligence and about 600 million years of protist evolution that did not produce high intelligence‚Ä¶What Drake, Sagan and Conway-Morris have done is interpret correlated parallel moves in evolution as if they were unconstrained by shared evolution but highly constrained by a universal selection pressure towards intelligence that could be extrapolated to extraterrestrials. I am arguing just the opposite ‚Äì that the apparently independent evolution toward higher E.Q. is largely constrained by shared evolution with no evidence for some universal selection pressure towards intelligence. If this view is correct, we cannot extrapolate the trends toward higher E.Q. to the evolution of extraterrestrials. If the convergence of dolphins and humans on high E.Q. has much to do with the 3.5 Gyr of shared history (and I argue that it has everything to do with it) then we are not justified to extrapolate this convergence to other extraterrestrial life forms that did not share this history. Extraterrestrials are related to us in the sense that they may be carbon and water based - they may have polymerized the same monomers using amino acids to make proteins, nucleotides to make a genetic code, lipids to make fats and sugars to make polysaccharides. However, our ‚Äúcommon ancestor‚Äù with extraterrestrials was probably pre-biotic and did not share a common limited set of genetic toggle switches that is responsible for the apparently independent convergences among terrestrial life forms.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶If heads were a convergent feature of evolution one would expect independent lineages to evolve heads. Our short twig on the lower left labeled ‚ÄúHomo‚Äù has heads, but heads are found in no other branch. Our two closest relatives, plants and fungi, do not seem to have any tendency toward evolving heads. The evolution of heads (encephalization) is therefore not a convergent feature of evolution. Heads are monophyletic and were once the possessions of only one quirky unique species that lived about six or seven hundred million years ago. Its ancestors, no doubt possessed some kind of proto-head related to neural crests and placodes (Wada 2001, Manzanares and Nieto 2003). Drake (2006) stated that ‚Äú[intelligence] is not a fluke that has occurred in some small sub-set of animal life.‚Äù However, Fig. 4 shows that intelligence, heads, even all animal life or multicellular life, may well be a fluke that is a small sub-set of terrestrial life. One potential problem with this conclusion: It is possible that existing heads could have suppressed the emergence of subsequent heads. Such suppression would be difficult to establish‚Ä¶.Life has been evolving on this planet for ~4 billion years. If the Planet of the Apes Hypothesis is correct and there is an intelligence niche that we have only recently occupied ‚Äì Who occupied it 2 billion years ago, or 1 billion years ago or 500 million years ago? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromatolites" title="Wikipedia: Stromatolites">Stromatolites</a>? Algae? Jellyfish?</p>
<p>‚Ä¶Today there are about a million species of protostomes and about 600,000 species of deuterostomes (of which we are one). We consider ourselves to be the smartest deuterostome. The most intelligent protostome is probably the octopus. After 600 million years of independent evolution and despite their big brains, octopi do not seem to be on the verge of building radio telescopes. The dolphinoidea evolved a large E.Q. between ~60 million years ago and ~20 million years ago (Marino et al 2004). Thus, dolphins have had ~20 million years to build a radio telescope and have not done so. This strongly suggests that high E.Q. may be a necessary, but is not a sufficient condition for the construction of radio telescopes. Thus, even if there were a universal trend toward high E.Q., the link between high E.Q. and the ability to build a radio telescope is not clear. If you live underwater and have no hands, no matter how high your E.Q., you may not be able to build, or be interested in building, a radio telescope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That‚Äôs because other creatures that are believed intelligent - such as dolphins, chimpanzees, some birds, elephants - are relatively closely related to humans. They‚Äôre all on the vertebrate branch of the tree of life, so there‚Äôs a chance the intelligence shares at least some characteristics. Octopuses, however, are invertebrates. Our last common ancestor reaches back to the dim depths of time, 500 million to 600 million years ago. That means octopus intelligence likely evolved entirely separately and could be very different from that of vertebrates. ‚ÄúOctopuses let us ask which features of our minds can we expect to be universal whenever intelligence arises in the universe, and which are unique to us,‚Äù Godfrey-Smith said. ‚ÄúThey really are an isolated outpost among invertebrates. ‚Ä¶ From the point of view of the philosophy of the mind, they are a big deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the major explanations for why primates and humans evolved intelligence is their close social relations &amp; pack structure. Cephalopods are solitary, so why are <em>they</em> intelligent? Camouflage seems like a possibility‚Ä¶ as does the endemic cephalopod cannibalism; from <a href="./docs/algernon/2009-ibanez.pdf">‚ÄúCannibalism in Cephalopods‚Äù</a>:</p>

<p>Cannibalism is so common in adult squids that it was assumed that they are unable to maintain their daily consumption without a cannibalistic part in their diet, due to their high metabolic rates‚Ä¶Cephalopods have the capacity to prey on both relatively small and large prey due to the skilfulness of their arms and tentacles as well as the possibility to shred their food with their beaks‚Ä¶Recognition of familiarity in cephalopods is possible, but not certain‚Ä¶and the possible lack of recognition could promote non hetero-cannibalism in cephalopods.</p>

<li id="fn52"><p>To extensively quote the June 2011 <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/07/whence-better-brains.html"><em>Scientific American</em> cover story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI think it is very likely that there is a law of diminishing returns‚Äù to increasing intelligence indefinitely by adding new brain cells‚Ä¶Size carries burdens with it, the most obvious one being added energy consumption. In humans, the brain is already the hungriest part of our body: at 2% of our body weight, this greedy little tapeworm of an organ wolfs down 20% of the calories that we expend at rest. In newborns, it‚Äôs an astounding 65%‚Ä¶</p>
<p>For decades this dividing of the brain into more work cubicles was viewed as a hallmark of intelligence. But it may also reflect a more mundane truth‚Ä¶: specialization compensates for the connectivity problem that arises as brains get bigger. As you go from a mouse brain to a cow brain with 100 times as many neurons, it is impossible for neurons to expand quickly enough to stay just as well connected. Brains solve this problem by segregating like-functioned neurons into highly interconnected modules, with far fewer long-distance connections between modules. The specialization between right and left hemispheres solves a similar problem; it reduces the amount of information that must flow between the hemispheres, which minimizes the number of long, interhemispheric axons that the brain needs to maintain. ‚ÄúAll of these seemingly complex things about bigger brains are just the backbends that the brain has to do to satisfy the connectivity problem‚Äù as it gets larger‚Ä¶‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt tell us that the brain is smarter.‚Äù‚Ä¶Neurons do get larger as brain size increases, but not quite quickly enough to stay equally well connected. And axons do get thicker as brains expand, but not quickly enough to make up for the longer conduction delays‚Ä¶In fact, neuroscientists have recently seen a similar pattern in variations within humans: people with the quickest lines of communication between their brain areas also seem to be the brightest. One study‚Ä¶used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure how directly different brain areas talk to one another - that is, whether they talk via a large or a small number of intermediary areas‚Ä¶Shorter paths between brain areas correlated with higher IQ‚Ä¶[Others] compared working memory (the ability to hold several numbers in one‚Äôs memory at once) among 29 healthy people‚Ä¶People with the most direct communication and the fastest neural chatter had the best working memory.</p>
<p>It is a momentous insight. We know that as brains get larger, they save space and energy by limiting the number of direct connections between regions. The large human brain has relatively few of these long-distance connections. But‚Ä¶these rare, nonstop connections have a disproportionate influence on smarts: brains that scrimp on resources by cutting just a few of them do noticeably worse‚Ä¶There is another reason to doubt that a major evolutionary leap could lead to smarter brains. Biology may have had a wide range of options when neurons first evolved, but 600 million years later a peculiar thing has happened. The brains of the honeybee, the octopus, the crow and intelligent mammals, Roth points out, look nothing alike at first glance. But if you look at the circuits that underlie tasks such as vision, smell, navigation and episodic memory of event sequences, ‚Äúvery astonishingly they all have absolutely the same basic arrangement.‚Äù Such evolutionary convergence usually suggests that a certain anatomical or physiological solution has reached maturity so that there may be little room left for improvement‚Ä¶So have humans reached the physical limits of how complex our brain can be, given the building blocks that are available to us? Laughlin doubts that there is any hard limit on brain function the way there is one on the speed of light. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more likely you just have a law of diminishing returns,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt becomes less and less worthwhile the more you invest in it.‚Äù Our brain can pack in only so many neurons; our neurons can establish only so many connections among themselves; and those connections can carry only so many electrical impulses per second. Moreover, if our body and brain got much bigger, there would be costs in terms of energy consumption, dissipation of heat and the sheer time it takes for neural impulses to travel from one part of the brain to another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counter-evidence would be observations that indicate evolution trying to compensate for limits in one system by investing even more into another system; for example, it has been observed that childbirth in humans is extremely risky and dangerous compared to other primates because the infant head is so enormous compared to the birth canal. If intelligence weren‚Äôt valuable, one would expect the head size to remain constant or decrease, and one certainly would not expect the over-sized human brain to grow even faster after child birth; yet the human <a href="http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/147262/1/j.cub.2011.07.019.pdf">prefrontal cortex</a> grows much faster in infancy than the chimpanzee prefrontal cortex does.<a href="#fnref52">‚Ü©</a></p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Giving a blind person a written IQ test is obviously not a very mean meaningful evaluation of his mental abilities. Yet that is exactly what many cross-species intelligence tests have done. Monkeys, for example, were found not only to learn visual discrimination tasks but to improve over a series of such tasks ‚Äì they formed a learning set, a general concept of the problem that betokened a higher cognitive process than a simple association. Rats given the same tasks showed difficulty in mastering the problems and no ability to form a learning set. The obvious conclusion was that monkeys are smarter than rats, a conclusion that was comfortably accepted, as it fit well with our preexisting prejudices about the distribution of general intelligence in nature. But when the rat experiments were repeated, only this time the rats were given the task of discriminating different smells, they learned quickly and showed rapid improvement on subsequent problems, just as the monkeys did.</p>
<p>The problem of motivation is another major confounding variable. Sometimes we may think we are testing an animal‚Äôs brain when we are only testing its stomach. For example, in a series of studies goldfish never learned to improve their performance when challenged with ‚Äúreversal‚Äù tasks. These are experiments in which an animal is trained to pick one of two alternative stimuli (a black panel versus a white panel, say) in order to obtain a food reward; the correct answer is then switched and the subject has to relearn which one to pick. Rats quickly learned to switch their response when the previously rewarded answer no longer worked. Fish didn‚Äôt. This certainly fit comfortably with everyone‚Äôs sense that fish are dumber than rats. But when the experiment was repeated with a different food reward (a paste squirted into the tank right where the fish made its correct choice, as opposed to pellets dropped into the back of the tank), lo and behold the goldfish suddenly did start improving on reversal tasks. Other seemingly fundamental learning differences between fish and rodents likewise vanished when the experiments were redesigned to take into account differences in motivation.</p>
<p>Equalizing motivation is an almost insoluble problem for designers of experiments. Are three goldfish pellets the equivalent of one banana or fifteen bird seeds? How could we even know? We would somehow have to enter into the internal being of different animals to know for sure, and if we could do that we would not need to be devising roundabout experiments to probe their mental processes in the first place. When we do control for all of the confounding variables that we possibly can, the striking thing about the ‚Äúpure‚Äù cognitive differences that remain is how the similarities in performance between different animals given similar problems vastly outweigh the differences. To be sure, there seems to be little doubt that chimpanzees can learn new associations with a single reinforced trial, and that that is genuinely faster than other mammals or pigeons do it. Monkeys and apes also learn lists faster than pigeons do. Apes and monkeys seem to have a faster and more accurate grasp of numerosity judgments than birds do. The ability to manipulate spatial information appears to be greater in apes than in monkeys.</p>
<p>But again and again experiments have shown that many abilities thought the sole province of ‚Äúhigher‚Äù primates can be taught, with patience, to pigeons or other animals. Supposedly superior rhesus monkeys did better than the less advanced cebus monkeys in a visual learning-set problem using colored objects. Then it turned out that the cebus monkeys did better than the rhesus monkeys when gray objects were used. Rats were believed to have superior abilities to pigeons in remembering locations in a radial maze. But after relatively small changes in the procedure and the apparatus, pigeons did just as well.</p>
<p>If such experiments had shown, say, that monkeys can learn lists of forty-five items but pigeons can only learn two, we would probably be convinced that there are some absolute differences in mental machinery between the two species. But the absolute differences are far narrower. Pigeons appear to differ from baboons and people in the way they go about solving problems that involve matching up two images that have been rotated one from the other, but they still get the right answers. They essentially do just as well as monkeys in categorizing slides of birds or fish or other things. Euan Macphail‚Äôs review of the literature led him to conclude that when it comes to the things that can be honestly called general intelligence, no convincing differences, either qualitative or quantitative, have yet been demonstrated between vertebrate species. While few cognitive researchers would go quite so far ‚Äì and in deed we will encounter a number of examples of differences in mental abilities between species that are hard to explain as anything but a fundamental difference in cognitive function ‚Äì it is striking how small those differences are, far smaller than ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù generally has it. Macphail has suggested that the ‚Äúno-difference‚Äù stance should be taken as a ‚Äúnull hypothesis‚Äù in all studies of comparative intelligence; that is, it is an alternative that always has to be considered and ought to be assumed to be the case unless proven otherwise.</p>

Each day the workout grows more strenuous-soon clients are asking five strangers for the time, making phone calls to acquaintances, or chatting with a stranger in an elevator. After a few months, some clients are ‚Äúsocially fit‚Äù enough to perform the ultimate workout: They walk into a crowded grocery store, lift a watermelon above their head, and purposely drop it on the floor, triumphantly enduring the stares of dozens of strangers. (The grocery store cleanup crew doesn‚Äôt enjoy this quite as much as the clients do.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, in her important study of mental illness in primitive societies, Murphy (1976) found that the Yupic-speaking Eskimos in northwest Alaska have a name, <em>kunlangeta</em>, for the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>man who, for example, repeatedly lies and cheats and steals things and does not go hunting and, when the other men are out of the village, takes sexual advantage of many women-someone who does not pay attention to reprimands and who is always being brought to the elders for punishment. One Eskimo among the 499 on their island was called <em>kunlangeta</em>. When asked what would have happened to such a person traditionally, an Eskimo said that probably somebody would have pushed him off the ice when nobody else was looking. (p.¬†1026)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is interesting since out of 500, the usual American base rates would predict not 1 but &gt;10 psychopaths. Is this all due to the tribal and closely knit nature of more aboriginal societies, or could Eskimo society really have been selecting against psychopaths while big modern societies give scope for their talents &amp; render them more evolutionarily fit? This may be unanswerable until the relevant genes are identified and samples of gene pools examined for the frequencies.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPsychopathy in specific subpopulations‚Äù, Sullivan &amp; Kosson (<em>Handbook</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rasmussen and colleagues (1999) hypothesized that in a nation such as Norway, where imprisonment is less frequent, more severe offenders who would be incarcerated anywhere are likely to comprise a higher proportion of the inmate population. However, this explanation does not likely apply to Scotland: The incarceration rate for the United States is five to eight times that of Scotland, but the base-rates of psychopathy in Scottish prisons are extremely low when compared to North American samples (i.e., 3% in Scotland vs.¬†28.4% in North America, applying the traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCL-R" title="Wikipedia: PCL-R">PCL-R</a> cutoff of ‚â•30; Cooke, 1995; Cooke &amp; Michie, 1999; Hare, 1991).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="./docs/algernon/2006-harris.pdf">‚ÄúTreatment of Psychopathy: A Review of Empirical Findings‚Äù</a>, Harris &amp; Rice 2006 (<em>Handbook</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe there is no evidence that any treatments yet applied to psychopaths have been shown to be effective in reducing violence or crime. In fact, some treatments that are effective for other offenders are actually harmful for psychopaths in that they appear to promote recidivism. We believe that the reason for these findings is that psychopaths are fundamentally different from other offenders and that there is nothing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with them in the manner of a deficit or impairment that therapy can ‚Äúfix.‚Äù Instead, they exhibit an evolutionarily viable life strategy that involves lying, cheating, and manipulating others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evolutionary hypothesis of psychopathy is striking (eg. it‚Äôs partially heritable; or, sex offenders who target post-pubertal women have the highest PCL-R scores compared to any other subdivision of sex offenders), but highly speculative. It‚Äôs discussed a little skeptically in the chapter ‚ÄúTheoretical and Empirical Foundations‚Äù in the <em>Handbook</em>.<a href="#fnref60">‚Ü©</a></p></li>
