LIST OF CARCINOGENS (Revised
&amp; Detailed List) <br/>
Do your products contain any of these carcinogens, cancer-causing
agents, toxins, irritants, contaminants or potentially harmful
ingredients? <br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/why.htm">http://jahtruth.net/why.htm</a> <br/>
<br/>
<b>Mouthwashes</b>: Alcohol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Flavoring, Sodium
Lauryl Sulfate <br/>
<b>Feminine Products &amp; Color Cosmetics</b>: Talc, Toluene <br/>
<b>Nail Polish</b>: Toluene <br/>
<b>Toothpastes</b>: Fluoride, Sodium Fluoride, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate
(SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), aluminium oxide <br/>
<b>Shampoos</b>: Diethanolamine (DEA or TEA), Propylene Glycol, Sodium
Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Benzyl/Benzene <b>Conditioners</b>:
Diethanolamine (DEA or TEA) Propylene Glycol <br/>
<b>Bubble Bath</b>: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate
(SLES), Benzoic/Benzyl, Diethanolamine (DEA or TEA) <br/>
<b>Shaving Gels/Creams</b>: Diethanolamine (DEA or TEA), Propylene

<b>Deodorants</b>: Aluminum, Butane, Propane, Propylene Glycol, Talc <br/>
<b>Shower Bars/Gels</b>: Bentoic/Benzyl, Diethanolamine (DEA or TEA),
Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) keep
reading... <br/>
<br/>
CHEMICAL &amp; ITS TOXICITY PROFILE/BODILY REACTIONS <br/>
<b>Alcohol</b>: implicated in mouth, tongue, and throat cancers. A
colorless, volatile, flammable liquid produced by the fermentation of
yeast and carbohydrates. Alcohol is used frequently as a solvent and is
also found in beverages and medicine. As an ingredient in ingestible
products, alcohol may cause body tissues to be more vulnerable to
carcinogens. Mouthwashes with an alcohol content of 25% or more have
been implicated in oral cancers. <br/>
<b>Alpha Hydroxy Acid</b>: skin irritant. An organic acid produced by
anaerobic respiration. Skin care products containing AHA exfoliate not
only dead skin cells, but the skinâ€™s protective barrier as well.
Long-term skin damage may result from its use. <br/>
<b>Aluminum: skin irritant.</b> Has been linked to Alzheimers disease.
Very commonly found in antiperspirants; it's used to clog your underarm
pores, so you don't sweat... not a good thing to do! The leading cause
of breast cancer is the use of antiperspirant, and brassieres. A
Concentration of toxins that leads to cell mutations (a.k.a. CANCER.)
Yes, ANTIPERSPIRANT. Most of the products out there are an
antiperspirant/deodorant combination so go home and check your labels.
Deodorant is fine, antiperspirant is not. It is also used in shampoos
and is the main ingredient in toothpaste that other poisons are added
to; and in both products has less distance to travel to the brain to
cause Alzheimers disease.<br/>
<b>ANILINE</b>: Related to both benzene and ammonia, it is used to make
a wide variety of organic chemical compounds including pharmaceuticals,
photographic chemicals, and dye intermediates. <br/>
<b>Animal Fat (Tallow)</b>: A type of animal tissue made up of oily
solids or semisolids that are water-insoluble esters of glycerol with
fatty acids. Animal fats and lye are the chief ingredients in bar soap,
a cleansing and emulsifying product that may act as a breeding ground
for bacteria <br/>
<b>Aspartame</b>: L-Aspartyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester, 98%,
aspartame CAS #22839-47-0 (a.k.a. Equal, NutraSweet
&lt;http://www.cloud-busters.com/NutraSweet/&gt; , Spoonful, Benevia,
Equal Measure, etc.) is composed of (at least) three things: 1.)
Aspartic acid, (around 40%) CAS # 56-84-8 2.) Phenylalanine, (around
50%) CAS # 63-91-2 3.) Methanol (wood alcohol) (10%) CAS # 67-56-1 A
fairly complete list of aspartame breakdown components from the
aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol is as follows: Formaldehyde
(embalming fluid) CAS # 50-00-0 CH2O Formic Acid (ant poison) CAS #
64-18-6 CH2O2 Beta Aspartame ** Aspartylphenylalanine **
Aspartylphenylalanine amide ** Tyrosine CAS # 60-18-4 C9H11NO3 L-Dopa
** Dopamine ** Norepinephrine ** Epinephrine ** Phenylethylamine CAS #
64-04-0 Phenylpyruvate ** Phenylactic acid ** Phenylacetic acid CAS #
103-82-2 Diketopiperazine (DKP) CAS # 106-57-0 <br/>
Aspartame was never and cannot be proven to be safe. It is not and
cannot be a diet aid because the formaldehyde (from the breakdown of
the 10% methanol) gets stored in the fat along with some water. The
National Soft Drink Association developed a 30-page protest (in the
'80s) that mentioned the fact that aspartame in a beverage was
unstable, and that it reduced the levels of serotonin (a substance that
gives one that "full" feeling), which can induce a craving for
carbohydrates. <br/>
<b>Bentonite</b>: may suffocate the skin. A porous clay that expands
many times its dry volume as it absorbs water. Commonly found in many
cosmetic foundations, may clog pores and suffocate the skin. *This is
also used to put out forest fires because it has the ability to smother
the flames. <br/>
<b>Benzene</b>: Implicated as the solvent that HIV/AIDS and/or
parasites uses to gain access of a major organ or system in the body.
Found in cold cereals, gasoline &amp; lubricants. See: Benzene,
Lubricants and AIDS: <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/benzeneandaids18jan02.html">http://educate-yourself.org/benzeneandaids18jan02.html</a>&nbsp;

HIV/AIDS can now be cured!: <a href="http://www.drclark.net/hiv/hiv_frame.htm">http://www.drclark.net/hiv/hiv_frame.htm</a>&nbsp;
<br/>
<b>Bronopol</b>: Act by releasing nitrites, which combine with DEA to
form nitrosamines. "One of the most expensive lines of cosmetics today,
Chanel, often uses this chemical. So do many leading brands of baby
products. And the Body Shop, whose product sales are built on a
reputation of containing natural ingredients, also offers products
containing this chemical. There are many safer yet equally effective
products available," states Dr. Epstein. ** <br/>
<b>Carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyscorbate 60</b>:
The first of these compounds has been shown to cause cancer in animals.
Used in cosmetics, inhalation of these products could cause chemical
pneumonitis. Bodily implantation of these substances will cause foreign
body [antibody] reaction (HOP, p. 308). <br/>
<b>Chlorhexidine</b>: Mildly toxic by ingestion. Skin irritant.
Mutation data reported (HC, p. 167). <br/>
<b>Coal Tar Dyes a.k.a. Artificial Colorings</b>: (FD&amp;C) are
derived from petroleum products and are harmful to ingest, as in
lipstick, in particular Blue 1, Green 3, Red 33, and Yellow 5&amp;6.
Blue #1 and Green #3 to name only a few. These colors are carcinogenic.
According to Dr. Epstein, "These carcinogenic dyes are often
contaminated with arsenic and lead." Check your toothpaste label on the
box it came in! These artificial dyes are in many other products as
well. <br/>
<b>Collagen</b>: may suffocate the skin. An insoluble fibrous protein
that is too large to penetrate the skin. The collagen found in most
skin care products is derived from animal skins and ground up chicken
feet. This ingredient forms a layer of film that may suffocate the
skin. The molecular weight of any product must be 3000 to enter the
skin, 800 to enter the cell, 75 to enter the blood stream. The
molecular weight of most skin &amp; hair products is over 10,000
therefore, is ineffective. <br/>
<b>Crystalline Silica</b>: carcinogen. According to Dr. Epstein,
"Crystalline Silica is present in some personal care products and
toiletries. It's been incriminated as a cause of lung cancer in both
animal studies and human." <br/>
<b>DEA (Diethanolamine)</b>: Interacts with nitrites to form a
*nitrosamine carcinogen; very common ingredient found in mainstream
cosmetics and toiletries. According to Dr. Epstein, "In studies by the
National Toxicology Program, to induce cancer of the liver and kidney
when applied to the skin of mice, it was shown to be readily absorbed
through the skin and to accumulate in organs. After this clear-cut
study which was released by the National Toxicology Program, you would
expect that the mainstream industry to have acted on this and to
replace DEA. Not on your life! Theres been a denial and an attempt to
trivialize the risk." Found in bubble bath, shampoo, liquid soap, body
lotions, and many other products. <br/>
<b>Dioxins</b>: a potentially carcinogenic by-product that results from
the process used to bleach paper at paper mills. Dioxin-treated
containers sometimes transfer dioxins to the product itself. (see
Sodium Laureth Sulfate). According to Dr. Epstein, "The Health
Protection Branch of Canada has reported dioxin levels in the parts per
trillion range in several samples of milk and cream packaged in
bleached milk cartons manufactured in the United States. Dioxin has
migrated from the cartons to the milk. Very likely U.S. milk products
are similarly contaminated with dioxin. Dioxins carcinogenicity is up
to 500,000 times more potent than that of DDT."&nbsp; <a href="http://www.chej.org/">http://www.chej.org/</a><br/>
<b>EDTA</b>: - An ingredient that is being studied by the FDA for
toxicity. (Also used in food). <br/>
<b>Elastin of High-molecular Weight</b>: - A protein similar to
collagen that is the main component of elastic fibers. Elastin is also
derived from animal sources. Its effect on the skin is similar to
collagen. <br/>
<b>Fluoride</b>: possible carcinogen. Dr. Epstein states, "There have
been several studies incriminating fluoride in bone cancer. The
important point about this is that the public have been given no
information on this and fluoride in toothpaste is particularly
dangerous because kids swallow a significant amount of the fluoride,
especially when toothpaste contains saccharin as many toothpastes
do."&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nofluoride.com/">http://www.nofluoride.com/&nbsp;</a><br/>
<b>Fluorocarbons</b>: can produce mild upper respiratory tract
irritation. A colorless, nonflammable gas or liquid commonly used as a
propellant in hairspray. <br/>
<b>Formaldehyde</b>: A toxic, colorless gas that is an irritant and a
carcinogen. When combined with water, formaldehyde is used as a
disinfectant, fixative, or preservative. Formaldehyde is found in many
cosmetic products and conventional nail care systems. <br/>
<b>Glycerin</b>: A syrupy liquid that is chemically produced by
combining water and fat. Unless the humidity of air is over 65 percent,
glycerin draws moisture from the lower layers of the skin and holds it
on the surface, which dries the skin from the inside out. Although
potentially harmful in skin care products, when applied inside the
moist cavity of the mouth, its properties as a humectant are
potentially beneficial. Glycerin helps dental products retain moisture,
as well as improve product consistency and spreadability--without
negative effects. <br/>
<b>HYDROQUINONE</b>: Manufactured by oxidizing aniline, it is used
extensively as a photographic developer and as a food antioxidant. <br/>
<b>Isopropyl Alcohol</b>: Implicated as the solvent that
cancer/parasites uses to gain access of a major organ or system in the
body. Isopropyl Alcohol will make parasite eggs hatch at an alarming
rate. It also causes cancerous tumors to grow very fast. It is an
ingredient that has been linked to neurological damage according to a
study. <br/>
As appeared in Arizona Networking News June/July 2000 issue <br/>
Consumer Alert-Isopropyl Alcohol by Marj Melchiors <br/>
In the past few years, the alternative health community has become
aware of the toxicity of isopropyl alcohol and other solvents used in
body care products. This information was brought to our attention by
books written by Dr Hulda Clark (The Cure For All Cancers). Dr. Clark's
theory is that isopropyl alcohol destroys the tough shell surrounding
the intestinal fluke (flora), and allows parasites to migrate into the
liver, prostrate, and uterus. In Dr. Clarkâ€™s opinion, this can be
devastating to the vital organs and predispose one to cancer and other
illnesses. There has been clinical research conducted by Dr Dietrich
Klinghardt, MD PhD. He has found that Dr. Clarks' parasite/solvent
theory to be valid. Dr. Klinghardt and staff found that after observing
and testing hundreds of patients detoxing from isopropyl alcohol
chemicals, the greatest injury occurs not to the parasite egg membrane
but to the patient's own cell and nerve membranes. Isopropyl alcohol is
lipophilic. In other words, it is attracted to the lipid layer
surrounding the cells and nerves. It interferes with the messenger
proteins that send information to the cells. The lipid fluids cannot
line up properly in the presence of these chemicals and can in turn
cause neurological effects and damage to the cells. Dr. Klinghardt
concluded that isopropyl alcohol has caused such symptoms as nausea,
mental confusion, coma, and death through ingestion, inhalation, and
skin absorption. One may wonder why these harmful chemicals are even
used in so many products. The main reason is that they have antiseptic,
anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, solvent and skin penetration qualities.
The second reason for their widespread use is that they are by-products
of the petroleum industry. In other words, oil companies are getting
paid for their "garbage". There are safe alternatives to using
isopropyl alcohol and its components in body care products. Be a wise
shopper and only buy products that are free of harmful isopropyl
chemicals. Avoid products with words such as propyl, methyl, butyl,
benzene, toluene, xylene, and styrene in their ingredient listing.
These would signify that they are in the isopropyl alcohol family. <br/>
The following is a chart of common alcohol solvents and what products
they are commonly used in. <br/>
Type of Alcohol/Use <br/>
<b>Butanol</b>/safety glass, hat and textile industry, shoes, cosmetics
<br/>
<b>Ethanol</b>/antibacterial agent in mouthwash, nail polish,
astringents, perfumes, cosmetics <br/>
<b>Isopropanol</b>/rubbing alcohol, paint thinner, antifreeze,
medications, makeup, shampoo, lotions <br/>
<b>Methanol</b>/antifreeze, cosmetics, soft drinks, infant formula <br/>

<br/>
<b>Kaolin</b>: may suffocate the skin. A fine white clay used in making
porcelain. Like bentonite, kaolin smothers and weakens the skin. Used
in cosmetic foundations, as well as absorbing powder, face masks,
liquid and cake powder and dry blusher. <br/>
<b>Lanolin</b>: highly contaminated with pesticides. According to Dr.
Epstein, "Most lanolin samples, at least 50 to 60%, are contaminated." <br/>
<b>Lidocaine</b>: Poison by ingestion and subcutaneous routes.
Excitement, hallucinations, distorted perceptions, changes in heart
rate, and dyspnea. Anesthetic rapidly absorbed by mucous membranes.
Excessive doses may cause methemoglobinemia (HC, p. 439; HOP, p.341.) <br/>
<b>Lye</b>: A highly concentrated watery solution of sodium hydroxide
or potassium hydroxide. Lye is combined with animal fats to make bar
soaps, which may corrode and dry out the skin. <br/>
<b>Methylparaben, propylparaben</b>: Close chemical cousins of benzoic
acid. Poisonous and moderately toxic. An allergen. Causes dyspnea and
allergic dermatitis (HC. pp. 132, 695, 702). Paraben Preservatives
(methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-) can imitate the hormone estrogen in
the body according to a recent study. (hard to find a good progesterone
cream with one of these). <br/>
<b>Mineral Oil (heavy) - Mineral Oil (light)</b>: smothers the skin. A
derivative of crude oil (petrolatum) that is used industrially as a
cutting fluid and lubricating oil. Mineral oil forms an oily film over
skin to lock in moisture, but traps in toxins and wastes, and clogs
your pores. It hinders normal skin respiration by keeping oxygen out. <br/>
<b>MSG (Monosodium Glutamate &amp; hidden MSG</b>: A Drug and
Neurotransmitter. Hidden names are: Definite Sources of MSG
&iuml;&frac34;&middot;
Hydrolyzed Protein &iuml;&frac34;&middot; Sodium Caseinate or Calcium

<b>NAPTHALENE</b>: The main constituent in mothballs and employed in
the production of dyes and synthetic resins. It is also used for
industrial lubricants, explosives, fungicides, and as a solvent and
preservative. <br/>
<b>Nitrosamine</b>: According to Dr. Epstein, "Weâ€™ve known since 1976
that DEA will react with nitrites which are present, as preservatives
or contaminants, in personal care products, to produce a carcinogen
known as nitrosodiethanolamine. This is found in virtually any cosmetic
that contains DEA. Consumers have been exposed without any information
and without any guidance whatsoever! In 1979 the FDA warned the
cosmetic industry that DEA was dangerous because of this. The cosmetic
industry ignored the warning! While over in Europe, strong action was
taken to phase out the use of DEA." <b>Padimate-O (also known as octyl
dimethyl PABA)</b>:
Act by releasing nitrites which combine with DEA to form *nitrosamines.
Found in cosmetics, especially sunscreens. "The most prudent consumers
will prefer sunscreens without padimate-O," states Dr. Epstein. <br/>
<b>Nonoxynol 9</b>: Poison by intraperitoneal route. Mutation data
reported. When heated to decomposition, it emits acrid smoke and fumes
(HC, p. 958). <br/>
Paraffin: Possible carcinogen with experimental tumorigenic data by
implant route. (HC, p. 982; HOP, p. 212). <br/>
<b>Para-phenylenediamine Dyes</b>: carcinogenic when oxidized.
According to Dr. Epstein, "These are dyes which are extensively used in
permanent black and dark brown hair dyes which have been incriminated
in a variety of cancers including non-Hodgkins lymphoma and multiple
myeloma." Something to think about: Jackie Kennedy used to dye her hair
black every two weeks or so and she died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. <br/>
<b>Petrolatum</b>: smothers the skin. A petroleum-based grease that is
used industrially as a grease component. Petrolatum exhibits many of
the same potentially harmful properties as mineral oil. <br/>
<b>PHENOL</b>: Chiefly manufactured from benzene, its chief uses are in
the manufacturing of plastics, dyes, and disinfectants. See Benzene and
relationship to illnesses. <br/>
<b>Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)</b>: "contaminated with a very potent
carcinogen; dioxane and very easily absorbed through the skin," states
Dr. Epstein. Used in a wide variety of personal care products.
Moderately toxic. Eye irritant. Possible carcinogen and flammable. Many
glycols produce severe acidosis, central nervous system damage, and
congestion (HC, p. 1053; HOP, pp. 193-195.) PEG/Polyethylene/-eth at
end of word can be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane. <br/>
<b>Propylene Glycol</b>: strong skin irritant. A cosmetic form of
mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid, and
industrial antifreeze. In skin and hair care products, propylene glycol
works as a humectant, which is a substance that retains the moisture
content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of
moisture or water. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) warn users to
avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant
can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage. Check out your body
lotions, deodorant, hair conditioner, hair gel, creams, and many more
products! Molecular weight of PGE is 60. (Ingredients with molecular
weight of 75 or lower enters our blood stream) <br/>
<b>Quanternium-15</b>: releases formaldehyde. According to Dr. Epstein,
"This ingredient is generally safe, BUT will break down in the bottle,
or tube, or on the skin to release formaldehyde for which the evidence
of its carcinogenicity is literally overwhelming." <br/>
<b>Saccharin</b>: carcinogen. According to Dr. Epstein, "The evidence
on the carcinogenicity of saccharin is literally overwhelming.
Saccharin is the only carcinogen identified in diet foods which is
listed as a carcinogen on the label." <br/>
<b>Sodium borate</b>: A.K.A. borax. Toxic to all cells. Prolonged
absorption causes anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and anemia (HOP, p.
396). <br/>
<b>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)</b>: skin irritant. It is rapidly
absorbed and retained in the eyes, brain, heart, and liver, which may
result in harmful long-term effects. SLS could retard healing, cause
cataracts in adults, and keep childrenâ€™s eyes from developing properly.
In fact, studies have shown that washing your hair one time with a
shampoo containing Sodium Lauryl Sulfate could put as many nitrates
into your bloodstream as eating a whole pound of bacon. And that is
just ONE application. Molecular weight of SLS is 40 (Ingredients with a
molecular weight of 75 or lower enters our blood stream) <br/><br/>
<br/>
<i>
Also see snopes.com/toxins/shampoo.htm<br/></i>
<b>Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)</b>: "contaminated with a very potent
carcinogen, dioxane and very easily absorbed through the skin," states
Dr. Epstein. SLES is the alcohol form (ethoxylated) of SLS. It is
slightly less irritating than SLS, but may cause more drying. Both SLS
and SLES may cause potentially carcinogenic formations of nitrates and
dioxins to form in shampoos and cleansers by reacting with other
product ingredients. Large amounts of nitrates may enter the blood
system from just one shampooing! <br/>
<b>Talc</b>: carcinogen. Used by some 20 million women in their
reproductive years not to mention, its wide use on infants in the form
of "baby powder". According to Dr. Epstein, M.D., "Talc should never be
used on babies both because of its carcinogenicity and acute
respiratory distress from inhalation that often results in death. There
are at least 3 clear cut studies which have been published in the
scientific literature that show routine application of talc in the
genital area is associated with up to a 3 to 4 fold increase in the
development of ovarian cancer." <br/>
<b>TEA (triethanolamine)</b>: Interacts with nitrites to form a
nitrosamine carcinogen. According to Dr. Epstein, "Your best
self-protection is to boycott any products containing DEA or TEA. That
will send a clear message to the cosmetic industry." Just like DEA, TEA
is very commonly found in creams, lotions, shampoo, and other products.
<br/>
<b>Triethanolamine</b>: Moderately toxic by ingestion. Liver and kidney
damage has been demonstrated in animals from chronic exposure. Possible
carcinogen (HC, p. 1273). <br/>

<p>Besides avoiding carcinogenic chemicals, it would be very helpful for all people to go on a healthy vegan diet (those who are into a healthy lifestyle will understand). What difference does it make to be concern about carcinogenic ingredients and still keep eating animal products which are ALL causing cancer and other diseases. Obviously the big food and cosmetics companies have no interest at all on keeping us safe and healthy. The sooner we realise it the better for all of us.<br/>
P.S. Green tea is a good start in right direction :) </p>

<p>As I presume this is a constantly developing topic. Therefore I have decided to setup a discussion board on Facebook, where we can share related information. You can find this under: Environmental carcinogens. </p>

<p> People should just accept the fact that we live and then we die. It's hard to change most aspects of this simple cycle to any great degree. If one thing doesn't get you...... something else most definitely will. Fear is the ultimate carcinogen. Because of fear, most people are dead way before they die. Read "The Epic of Gilgamesh".......it helps.....some.</p>
