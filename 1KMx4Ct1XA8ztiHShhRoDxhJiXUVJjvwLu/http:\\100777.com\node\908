For over 50 years now, the environmental movement has desperately
struggled against modern civilization's rush to ecological destruction,
yet today we stand on the cusp of what many scientists refer to as the
"Sixth Great Extinction," one caused this time not by a meteor or other
"natural" disasters, but by the accumulated impacts of human activity.<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/environ.htm">http://jahtruth.net/environ.htm</a><br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/x_files.htm">http://jahtruth.net/x_files.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Like a snowball rolling down a steep hill, the evidence is rapidly
accumulating - there's a limit to how much bulldozing, plowing, paving,
deforestation, pollution, and other human impacts Earth can take, and
we've gone over it. The situation is so bad that scientists are now
racing to set up a gene bank of the world's endangered animals, with
thousands of species expected to become extinct within a generation due
to climate change and habitat destruction.<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/signs.htm">http://jahtruth.net/signs.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
According to Richard Cincotta, ecologist and senior researcher,
Population Action International, "There are now more human babies born
each day -- about 350,000 -- than there are individuals left in all the
great ape species combined, including gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos
and orangutans." Orangutans once ranged throughout Southeast Asia.
Today they can be found only on the Indonesian islands of Borneo and
Sumatra. Scientists estimate that in the last 10 years their numbers
have been reduced by up to 50 percent, to perhaps as few as 13,000
living in the wild. Lion populations have fallen by almost 90% in the
past 20 years, leaving the animal close to extinction in Africa, a
wildlife expert has warned. There are now only 23,000 left, compared to
an estimated 200,000 two decades ago, according to Laurence Frank, a
wildlife biologist from the University of California.<br/>
<a href="http://jahtruth.net/envird.htm">http://jahtruth.net/envird.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
As for the oceans, they may look pristine but experts warn that life
below the sea could collapse. A study by Ran Myers and Boris Worm of
Nova Scotia's Dalhousie University reported that 90 percent of all
large fishes have disappeared from the world's oceans in the past half
century, the devastating result of industrial fishing. Those marine
biologists say not only bluefin tuna but also other fish stocks are
plummeting across the world, upsetting delicate natural food chains.
Some fear irreversible damage has already been done. Even worse,
international law experts add, little is being done to stop it. Despite
all the evidence, high-tech fleets probe the last deep water refuges,
hardly troubled by authorities.<br/>
<br/>
Should Earth continue its warming pattern, scientists fear shore and
habitat erosion, increased salinity of estuaries and freshwater
aquifers, altered tidal ranges in rivers and bays, changes in sediments
and nutrient transport, a change in patterns of chemical and microbial
contamination in coastal areas, and increased coastal flooding.
Ecosystems particularly at risk include saltwater marshes, mangrove
ecosystems, coastal wetlands, coral reefs, coral atolls, and river
deltas.<br/>
<br/>
Almost half of all plant species could be facing extinction, according
to new research by botanists in the United States. The official
estimate by the World Conservation Union - the IUCN - suggests that 13%
of the world's plant species are under threat, but the two US botanists
say it is at least 22% and could be as many as 47%. Tropical forests
alone are estimated to be disappearing at the rate of 12 million to 15
million hectares (46,000 to 59,000 square miles) a year.<br/>
<br/>
This list of environmental ills that destroy our local and global
environment could go on and on and on, as exemplified in the
complementary information section below.<br/>
<br/>
Our modern culture presents itself as something inevitable, even
"natural," as if we have no choice but to continue to live alienated
and Earth-destructive lives, but this is a lie. There is a way of
living human life on Earth that is far more healthy, graceful and
balanced than the destructive alienation currently driving us towards
disaster, a way of life so powerfully connected to the often unnoticed
wonder that surrounds us that it can actually heal the immense
devastation we've caused during our march to "civilization." It is high
time we heal our "koyannisqatsi" - our deadly estrangement from nature
and the devastating damage it has caused to the processes that support
life on Earth, as well as our own epidemic of human physical,
emotional, social, and spiritual diseases. Despite huge progress in
parts of the world in so-called environmental awareness, there is still
a huge gap between what we profess or believe about the preciousness of
all life-forms and the lightning speed with which we go about
destroying the environment through our individual choices as consumers
and the cumulative consequences of simple food choices, preferred
lifestyles, transportation modes, and indulging in the multifaceted
comforts of modern civilization.<br/>
<br/>
May every human being realize soon how fragile are the ecological
processes that maintain a steady and dynamic equilibrium without which
nothing of what we have taken for granted for so long would exist. The
exquisite beauty of all Life in its myriad manifestations and the ever
enchanting wonders of Nature are too sacred and just too precious to be
wasted and blindly destroyed in the blink of an eye, on a cosmic
time-scale perspective, as we are collectively doing right now. <br/>

Bangladesh capital inundated as millions suffer in flooded South Asia

DHAKA,
Bangladesh - Residents waded through sewage and rowed boats on flooded
roads in this city of 10 million people, as 44 more victims drowned and
the death toll from monsoon rains reached 1,100 across South Asia on
Tuesday. The annual monsoon flooding, fed by melting snow and
torrential rains, has left millions across South Asia marooned or
homeless. At least 686 people have died in India, 102 in Nepal and five
in Pakistan, according to reports from officials. The new deaths were
reported Monday and Tuesday in central and northern Bangladesh as
waters receded in some flooded areas, raising the number killed in this
delta nation to 394, the government said. Most of the deaths were
caused by drowning, lightning, snakebites, and outbreaks of waterborne
diseases.(...) The floods in Bangladesh are the worst since 1998. They
have engulfed two-thirds of the country, affecting more than 25 million
people. Up to 1.3 million displaced people huddled in about 4,000 flood
shelters. &nbsp;CLIP<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Greenland ice-melt 'speeding up' (July
28, 2004)</span><br/>

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3922579.stm</a><br/>
First you hear a savage cracking sound, next the rolling crash of
thunder. Then as the icebergs rip away from the margin of the ice-sheet
they plunge into the grey waters of the Atlantic with a roar that
echoes around the mountains. &nbsp;In some places, the ice is melting
one
metre a month. Nothing prepares you for the sheer scale and drama of
events in this forbidding terrain and all the signs are that the
changes at work here are gathering pace. The only way to reach the
ice-sheet is by helicopter - a spectacular flight through remote fjords
and the jagged blue-white rubble of the ice. We travelled with Danish
scientist Carl Boggild of GEUS, the Geological Survey of Denmark and
Greenland. For the past few years he has been managing a network of 10
automatic monitoring stations and his first results are alarming - the
edges of the ice-sheet are melting up to 10 times more rapidly than
earlier research had indicated. &nbsp;(...) "We can say for certain
that the
rate of melting has increased and we can say for certain that the
height of the ice-sheet is falling, even allowing for increased
ice-flow. "There is no doubt that something very major is happening
here." As we speak, he checks the instruments on the automatic station.
A large range of data is collected and transmitted via satellite to
Copenhagen every six hours. For the first time, scientists should have
a long-term, on-the-ground view of the changes taking place here. Just
before we leave, there is another roar as more icebergs crash into the
ocean Many more icebergs falling into the sea will cause two things to
happen - the sea-level will rise and the injection of freshwater could
disrupt the ocean currents, including the Gulf Stream. What happens in
this remote barren land has the potential to affect us all.<br/>

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3930765.stm</a><br/>
To visit the Maldives is to witness the slow death of a nation. For as
well as being blessed with sun-kissed paradise islands and pale, white
sands, this tourist haven is cursed with mounting evidence of an
environmental catastrophe. &nbsp;The country is portrayed by travel
companies as a tropical paradise. To the naked eye, the signs of
climate change are almost imperceptible, but government scientists fear
the sea level is rising up to 0.9cm a year. Since 80% of its 1,200
islands are no more than 1m above sea level, within 100 years the
Maldives could become uninhabitable. The country's 360,000 citizens
would be forced to evacuate. The Maldives' survival as a sovereign
nation is truly at stake. CLIP<br/>

Alaska It is thought to be the most extreme example of global warming
on the planet. &nbsp;Some estimate that the sea moves inland three
metres a
year. The village of Shishmaref lies on a tiny island on the edge of
the arctic circle - and it is literally being swallowed by the sea.
Houses the Eskimos have occupied for generations are now wilting and
buckled. Some have fallen into the sea. Not only is the earth crumbling
underfoot, but the waves are rising ominously all around. &nbsp;(...)
&nbsp;Locals are planning to relocate to the mainland. Because
temperatures
in Alaska have increased by as much as 4.4C over the last 30 years,
glaciers are starting to melt, causing the sea levels to rise. The
increased temperature is also thawing the frozen ground, which is known
as permafrost, on which the arctic communities such as Shishmaref were
built. It is this thawing that is causing the ground to crumble like
sand. CLIP<br/>

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3143798.stm</a><br/>
The future of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change is largely in the
hands of the world's biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.
BBC News Online looks at how much they emit, what are they doing about
it and where they stand on Kyoto. <a href="/usa/">The US </a>emits
more, absolutely and per
head, than any other country - although it also produces more wealth.
When Kyoto was agreed, the US signed and committed to reducing its
emissions by 6%. But since then it has pulled out of the agreement and
its carbon dioxide emissions have increased to more than 15% above 1990
levels. For the agreement to become a legally binding treaty, it must
be ratified by countries which together were responsible for at least
55% of the total 1990 emissions reported by the industrialised
countries and emerging economies which made commitments to reduce their
emissions under the protocol. As the US accounted for 36.1% of those
emissions, this 55% target is much harder to achieve without its
participation. President George W Bush said in March 2001 that the US
would not ratify Kyoto because he thought it would damage the US
economy and because it did not yet require developing countries to cut
their emissions. CLIP<br/>

<br/>
Update July 29th: During their latest prowl our jaguars tracked down
five more bulldozers clear cutting and burning the forest. Using their
motorbikes they intercepted the bulldozers and blocked their path to
the forest thus ending today's planned destruction. The machines have
been locked up with chains and 'Blocked by Greenpeace' is now stamped
on all the diggers. Monday's bulldozers are also still locked up so,
all in all, our prowlers have managed to immobilize eight bulldozers.
(...) In Argentina, 75 percent of our native forests have already
disappeared, and every hour the equivalent of 20 football pitches
(soccer fields, for you North Americans) of forest is destroyed to grow
transgenic soya. The damage is irreversible, it is almost impossible to
grow forest on the soil again - and today an area the size of Germany
is at risk. In the last month, a provincial government has already sold
off a natural reserve to companies planning to sow genetically
engineered (GE) soya, an unprecedented act. This cannot carry on!
That's why the Greenpeace Jaguars have gone into action to defend
north-west Argentina's remaining forest. CLIP<br/>

ALGIERS, Algeria - Damage from swarms of locusts eating vital crops in
North and West Africa could triple to $245 million within a year if no
emergency aid is provided soon, <a href="/un/">U.N.</a> and government
experts say.
"Locusts use war tactics. Locusts know no borders. Donors have to
understand ... we face the risks of famine and death," Senegalese
Agriculture Minister Habib Syla told a regional meeting to discuss the
plague. Desert locust swarms contain up to 80 million insects per
square kilometer and travel more than 80 miles a day. An adult desert
locust can munch its own weight, or about two grams, of food a day.
Swarms can devastate entire crop fields in minutes. The <a href="/un/">U.N.</a>

serious to hit West Africa since a 1987-89 plague which cost more than
$300 million. CLIP<br/>

More than four out of ten items of fruit, vegetable and cereals on sale
in Britain contain traces of pesticide, according to a new report which
reveals the extent of chemical contamination in the food chain. Of a
total of 2,087 samples, 889 - or 43 per cent - were found to contain
some form of pesticide. Meanwhile 34 items, or 1.6 per cent of the
total, exceeded the maximum safety levels laid down by the authorities.
(...) Across Europe, more than 46,000 samples of mostly fresh food were
analysed for traces of 170 pesticides. Compared with previous years the
percentage with no detectable residues has decreased and those over the
maximum threshold has risen as has those with some pesticide traces.

In the face of the environmental crisis now bearing down on us, Life
Disintegrating/Earth Crash takes a unique approach to environmental
issues, one dedicated to documenting Earth's environmental collapse due
to the accumulated impacts of human activity without any of the usual
sugar-coating. It contains in-depth coverage of the compelling evidence
that the ecological collapse of Earth has indeed begun, by means of
hundreds of news article from a wide variety of sources such as the
BBC, New York Times, the international journals Science and Nature, and
many other sources, with links to the original source articles.<br/>
<br/>
If Life Disintegrating/Earth Crash succeeds at its mission, it is
likely you will be very disturbed after spending some time browsing
through it. If so, you are encouraged to look at what else is offered
at Earth Crash Earth Spirit. Crazy Life (
<a href="http://eces.org/archive/dwc_pages/index.php/21">http://eces.org/archive/dwc_pages/index.php/21</a>
) presents an analysis -
albeit a very challenging one - of how we got into this fix. Another
Way of Living (<a href="http://eces.org/archive/dwc_pages/index.php/409">http://eces.org/archive/dwc_pages/index.php/409</a>
)
outlines a new way of thinking about and living human life on Earth
that is far more healthy, graceful and balanced than the destructive
alienation currently driving us towards disaster. And, finally, Earth
Spirit ( <a href="http://eces.org/archive/dwc_pages/index.php/3">http://eces.org/archive/dwc_pages/index.php/3</a>
) offers us
hope, because there are ways of healing the damage we caused, although
not by the usual means we've been trained to think of, such as yet more
technological fixes.<br/>
