Amdocs, Inc., the company which subcontracts billing and directory services for phone companies around the world, including 90 percent of American phone companies, is owned by Israeli interests. Yet another company, Comverse Infosys, is suspected of having built a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; into the equipment permanently installed into the phone system that allows instant eavesdropping by law enforcement agencies on any phone in America. This includes yours. </p>

<p><strong>Part 1 of 4</strong></p>
<p><b>BRIT HUME, HOST: It has been more than 16 years since a civilian working
for the Navy was charged with passing secrets to Israel. Jonathan Pollard
pled guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage and is serving a life sentence.
At first, Israeli leaders claimed Pollard was part of a rogue operation,
but later took responsibility for his work. </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Fox News has learned some U.S. investigators believe that there are
Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S., who may
have known things they didn't tell us before September 11. Fox News correspondent
Carl Cameron has details in the first of a four-part series. </p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p>
<p>CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Since September 11, more than 60
Israelis have been arrested or detained, either under the new patriot
anti-terrorism law, or for immigration violations. A handful of active
Israeli military were among those detained, according to investigators,
who say some of the detainees also failed polygraph questions when asked
about alleged surveillance activities against and in the United States.
</p>
<p>There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9-11 attacks,
but investigators suspect that they Israelis may have gathered intelligence
about the attacks in advance, and not shared it. A highly placed investigator
said there are &quot;tie-ins.&quot; But when asked for details, he flatly
refused to describe them, saying, &quot;evidence linking these Israelis
to 9-11 is classified. I cannot tell you about evidence that has been
gathered. It's classified information.&quot; </p>
<p>Fox News has learned that one group of Israelis, spotted in North Carolina
recently, is suspected of keeping an apartment in California to spy on
a group of Arabs who the United States is also investigating for links
to terrorism. Numerous classified documents obtained by Fox News indicate
that even prior to September 11, as many as 140 other Israelis had been
detained or arrested in a secretive and sprawling investigation into suspected
espionage by Israelis in the United States. </p>
<p>Investigators from numerous government agencies are part of a working
group that's been compiling evidence since the mid '90s. These documents
detail hundreds of incidents in cities and towns across the country that
investigators say, &quot;may well be an organized intelligence gathering
activity.&quot; </p>
<p>The first part of the investigation focuses on Israelis who say they
are art students from the University of Jerusalem and Bazala Academy.
They repeatedly made contact with U.S. government personnel, the report
says, by saying they wanted to sell cheap art or handiwork. </p>
<p>Documents say they, &quot;targeted and penetrated military bases.&quot;
The DEA, FBI and dozens of government facilities, and even secret offices
and unlisted private homes of law enforcement and intelligence personnel.
The majority of those questioned, &quot;stated they served in military
intelligence, electronic surveillance intercept and or explosive ordinance
units.&quot;</p>
<p>Another part of the investigation has resulted in the detention and arrests
of dozens of Israelis at American mall kiosks, where they've been selling
toys called Puzzle Car and Zoom Copter. Investigators suspect a front.
</p>
<p>Shortly after <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Washington Post</i> reported
the Israeli detentions last months, the carts began vanishing. Zoom Copter's
Web page says, &quot;We are aware of the situation caused by thousands
of mall carts being closed at the last minute. This in no way reflects
the quality of the toy or its salability. The problem lies in the operators'
business policies.&quot;</p>
<p>Why would Israelis spy in and on the U.S.? A general accounting office
investigation referred to Israel as country A and said, &quot;According
to a U.S. intelligence agency, the government of country A conducts the
most aggressive espionage operations against the U.S. of any U.S. ally.&quot;</p>
<p>A defense intelligence report said Israel has a voracious appetite for
information and said, &quot;the Israelis are motivated by strong survival
instincts which dictate every possible facet of their political and economical
policies. It aggressively collects military and industrial technology
and the U.S. is a high priority target.&quot;</p>
<p>The document concludes: &quot;Israel possesses the resources and technical
capability to achieve its collection objectives.&quot;</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Israeli embassy here in Washington issued a denial
saying that any suggestion that Israelis are spying in or on the U.S.
is &quot;simply not true.&quot; There are other things to consider. And
in the days ahead, we'll take a look at the U.S. phone system and law
enforcement's methods for wiretaps. And an investigation that both have
been compromised by our friends overseas.</p>
<p>HUME: Carl, what about this question of advanced knowledge of what was
going to happen on 9-11? How clear are investigators that some Israeli
agents may have known something? </p>
<p>CAMERON: It's very explosive information, obviously, and there's a great
deal of evidence that they say they have collected &#151; none of it necessarily
conclusive. It's more when they put it all together. A bigger question,
they say, is how could they not have know? Almost a direct quote.</p>
<p>HUME: Going into the fact that they were spying on some Arabs, right?</p>
<p>CAMERON: Correct. </p>
<p>HUME: All right, Carl, thanks very much</p>
<p>60 Israelis who had been detained in connection with the Sept. 11 terrorism
investigation.</p>
<p>Carl Cameron Investigates Part 2 </p>
<p><strong>Part 2 of 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>BRIT HUME, HOST:</strong> Last time we reported on the approximately
60 Israelis who had been detained in connection with the Sept. 11 terrorism
investigation.&nbsp; Carl Cameron reported that U.S. investigators suspect that
some of these Israelis were spying on Arabs in this country, and may have turned
up information on the planned terrorist attacks back in September that was not
passed on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Tonight, in the second of four reports on spying by Israelis in the U.S., we
learn about an Israeli-based private communications company, for whom a half-dozen
of those 60 detained suspects worked. American investigators fear information
generated by this firm may have fallen into the wrong hands and had the effect
of impeded the Sept. 11 terror inquiry. Here's Carl Cameron's second report.</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p>
<p><strong>CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT</strong> (voice-over):&nbsp; Fox
News has learned that some American terrorist investigators fear certain suspects
in the Sept. 11 attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them, by knowing who
and when investigators are calling on the telephone.&nbsp; How?</p>
<p>By obtaining and analyzing data that's generated every time someone in the
U.S. makes a call.&nbsp; </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What city and state, please?</p>
<p>CAMERON:&nbsp; Here's how the system works. Most directory assistance calls,
and virtually all call records and billing in the U.S. are done for the phone
companies by Amdocs Ltd., an Israeli-based private elecommunications company.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Amdocs has contracts with the 25 biggest phone companies in America, and more
worldwide.&nbsp; The White House and other secure government phone lines are
protected, but it is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones without
generating an Amdocs record of it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In recent years, the FBI and other government agencies have investigated Amdocs
more than once.&nbsp; The firm has repeatedly and adamantly denied any security
breaches or wrongdoing.&nbsp; But sources tell Fox News that in 1999, the super
secret national security agency, headquartered in northern Maryland, issued
what's called a Top Secret sensitive compartmentalized information report, TS/SCI,
warning that records of calls in the United States were getting into foreign
hands &#150; in Israel, in particular. </p>
<p>Investigators don't believe calls are being listened to, but the data about
who is calling whom and when is plenty valuable in itself.&nbsp; An internal
Amdocs memo to senior company executives suggests just how Amdocs generated
call records could be used.&nbsp; &#147;Widespread data mining techniques and
algorithms.... combining both the properties of the customer&nbsp; (e.g., credit
rating) and properties of the specific &#145;behavior&#133;.&#146;&#148; Specific
behavior, such as who the customers are calling.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Amdocs memo says the system should be used to prevent phone fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But U.S. counterintelligence analysts say it could also be used to spy through
the phone system.&nbsp; Fox News has learned that the N.S.A has held numerous
classified conferences to warn the F.B.I. and C.I.A. how Amdocs records could
be used.&nbsp; At one NSA briefing, a diagram by the Argon national lab was
used to show that if the phone records are not secure, major security breaches
are possible.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Another briefing document said, &quot;It has become increasingly apparent that
systems and networks are vulnerable.&#133;Such crimes always involve unauthorized
persons, or persons who exceed their authorization...citing on exploitable vulnerabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>Those vulnerabilities are growing, because according to another briefing, the
U.S. relies too much on foreign companies like Amdocs for high-tech equipment
and software.&nbsp; &quot;Many factors have led to increased dependence on code
developed overseas.... We buy rather than train or develop solutions.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence does not believe the Israeli government is involved in a
misuse of information, and Amdocs insists that its data is secure. What U.S.
government officials are worried about, however, is the possibility that Amdocs
data could get into the wrong hands, particularly organized crime.&nbsp; And
that would not be the first thing that such a thing has happened.&nbsp; Fox
News has documents of a 1997 drug trafficking case in Los Angeles, in which
telephone information, the type that Amdocs collects, was used to &quot;completely
compromise the communications of the FBI, the Secret Service, the DEO and the
LAPD.&quot; </p>
<p>We'll have that and a lot more in the days ahead &#150; Brit. </p>
<p>HUME:&nbsp; Carl, I want to take you back to your report last night on those
60 Israelis who were detained in the anti-terror investigation, and the suspicion
that some investigators have that they may have picked up information on the
9/11 attacks ahead of time and not passed it on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There was a report, you'll recall, that the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence
agency, did indeed send representatives to the U.S. to warn, just before 9/11,
that a major terrorist attack was imminent.&nbsp; How does that leave room for
the lack of a warning? </p>
<p>CAMERON:&nbsp; I remember the report, Brit. We did it first internationally
right here on your show on the 14th.&nbsp; What investigators are saying is
that that warning from the Mossad was nonspecific and general, and they believe
that it may have had something to do with the desire to protect what are called
sources and methods in the intelligence community.&nbsp; The suspicion being,
perhaps those sources and methods were taking place right here in the United
States. </p>
<p>The question came up in select intelligence committee on Capitol Hill today.&nbsp;
They intend to look into what we reported last night, and specifically that
possibility &#150; Brit. </p>
<p>HUME:&nbsp; So in other words, the problem wasn't lack of a warning, the problem
was lack of useful details? </p>
<p>CAMERON:&nbsp; Quantity of information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>HUME:&nbsp; All right, Carl, thank you very much. </p>

<p><strong>BRIT HUME, HOST</strong>:&nbsp; Last time we reported on an Israeli-based
company called Amdocs Ltd. that generates the computerized records and
billing data for nearly every phone call made in America.&nbsp; As Carl
Cameron reported, U.S. investigators digging into the 9/11 terrorist attacks
fear that suspects may have been tipped off to what they were doing by
information leaking out of Amdocs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In tonight's report, we learn that the concern about phone security extends
to another company, founded in Israel, that provides the technology that
the U.S. government uses for electronic eavesdropping.&nbsp; Here is Carl
Cameron's third report.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p>
<p><strong>CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT</strong> (voice-over):&nbsp;
The company is Comverse Infosys, a subsidiary of an Israeli-run private
telecommunications firm, with offices throughout the U.S.&nbsp; It provides
wiretapping equipment for law enforcement.&nbsp; Here's how wiretapping
works in the U.S. </p>
<p>Every time you make a call, it passes through the nation's elaborate
network of switchers and routers run by the phone companies.&nbsp; Custom
computers and software, made by companies like Comverse, are tied into
that network to intercept, record and store the wiretapped calls, and
at the same time transmit them to investigators.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The manufacturers have continuing access to the computers so they can
service them and keep them free of glitches.&nbsp; This process was authorized
by the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Senior government officials have now told Fox News that while CALEA made
wiretapping easier, it has led to a system that is seriously vulnerable
to compromise, and may have undermined the whole wiretapping system.</p>
<p>Indeed, Fox News has learned that Attorney General John Ashcroft and&nbsp;
FBI Director Robert Mueller were both warned Oct. 18 in a hand-delivered
letter from 15 local, state and federal law enforcement&nbsp; officials,
who complained that &quot;law enforcement's current&nbsp; electronic surveillance
capabilities are less effective today than they&nbsp; were at the time
CALEA was enacted.&quot;</p>
<p>Congress insists the equipment it installs is secure.&nbsp; But the&nbsp;
complaint about this system is that the wiretap computer programs made
by&nbsp; Comverse have, in effect, a back door through which wiretaps
themselves can&nbsp; be intercepted by unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>Adding to the suspicions is the fact that in Israel, Comverse works&nbsp;
closely with the Israeli government, and under special programs, gets&nbsp;
reimbursed for up to 50 percent of its research and development costs
by&nbsp; the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade.&nbsp; But investigators
within the&nbsp; DEA, INS and FBI have all told Fox News that to pursue
or even suggest&nbsp; Israeli spying through Comverse is considered career
suicide.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And sources say that while various F.B.I. inquiries into Comverse have&nbsp;
been conducted over the years, they've been halted before the actual&nbsp;
equipment has ever been thoroughly tested for leaks.&nbsp; A 1999 F.C.C.&nbsp;
document indicates several government agencies expressed deep concerns
that&nbsp; too many unauthorized non-law enforcement personnel can access
the wiretap&nbsp; system.&nbsp; And the FBI's own nondescript office in
Chantilly, Virginia that&nbsp; actually oversees the CALEA wiretapping
program, is among the most agitated&nbsp; about the threat.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But there is a bitter turf war internally at F.B.I.&nbsp; It is the FBI's&nbsp;
office in Quantico, Virginia, that has jurisdiction over awarding contracts&nbsp;
and buying intercept equipment.&nbsp; And for years, they've thrown much

over the years now work&nbsp; for the company.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And what troubles investigators most, particularly in New York, in the&nbsp;
counter terrorism investigation of the World Trade Center attack, is that
on&nbsp; a number of cases, suspects that they had sought to wiretap and
survey&nbsp; immediately changed their telecommunications processes.&nbsp;
They started&nbsp; acting much differently as soon as those supposedly
secret wiretaps went&nbsp; into place &#150; Brit.</p>
<p>HUME:&nbsp; Carl, is there any reason to suspect in this instance that
the&nbsp; Israeli government is involved? </p>
<p>CAMERON:&nbsp; No, there's not.&nbsp; But there are growing instincts
in an&nbsp; awful lot of law enforcement officials in a variety of agencies
who suspect&nbsp; that it had begun compiling evidence, and a highly classified
investigation&nbsp; into that possibility &#150; Brit.</p>
<p>HUME:&nbsp; All right, Carl.&nbsp; Thanks very much.</p>

<p><strong>TONY SNOW, HOST</strong>:&nbsp; This week, senior correspondent
Carl Cameron has reported on a longstanding government espionage investigation.&nbsp;
Federal officials this year have arrested or detained nearly 200 Israeli
citizens suspected of belonging to an &quot;organized intelligence-gathering
operation.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bush administration has deported most
of those arrested after Sept. 11, although some are in custody under the
new anti-terrorism law.</p>
<p>Cameron also investigates the possibility that an Israeli firm generated
billing data that could be used for intelligence purpose, and describes
concerns that the federal government's own wiretapping system may be vulnerable.&nbsp;
Tonight, in part four of the series, we'll learn about the probable roots
of the probe: a drug case that went bad four years ago in L.A.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p>
<p><strong>CARL CAMERON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT</strong> (voice-over):&nbsp;
Los Angeles, 1997, a major local, state and federal drug investigating
sours.&nbsp; The suspects:&nbsp; Israeli organized crime with operations
in New York, Miami, Las Vegas, Canada, Israel and Egypt.&nbsp; The allegations:
cocaine and ecstasy trafficking, and sophisticated white-collar credit
card and computer fraud.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The problem: according to classified law enforcement documents obtained
by Fox News, the bad guys had the cops&#146; beepers, cell phones, even
home phones under surveillance.&nbsp; Some who did get caught admitted
to having hundreds of numbers and using them to avoid arrest. </p>
<p>&quot;This compromised law enforcement communications between LAPD detectives
and other assigned law enforcement officers working various aspects of
the case.&nbsp; The organization discovered communications between organized
crime intelligence division detectives, the FBI and the Secret Service.&quot;</p>
<p>Shock spread from the DEA to the FBI in Washington, and then the CIA.&nbsp;&nbsp;
An investigation of the problem, according to law enforcement documents,
concluded, &quot;The organization has apparent extensive access to database
systems to identify pertinent personal and biographical information.&quot;</p>
<p>When investigators tried to find out where the information might have
come from, they looked at Amdocs, a publicly traded firm based in Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Amdocs generates billing data for virtually every call in America, and
they do credit checks.&nbsp; The company denies any leaks, but investigators
still fear that the firm's data is getting into the wrong hands.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When investigators checked their own wiretapping system for leaks, they
grew concerned about potential vulnerabilities in the computers that intercept,
record and store the wiretapped calls.&nbsp; A main contractor is Comverse
Infosys, which works closely with the Israeli government, and under a
special grant program, is reimbursed for up to 50 percent of its research
and development costs by Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade. </p>
<p>Asked this week about another sprawling investigation and the detention
of 60 Israeli since Sept. 11, the Bush administration treated the questions
like hot potatoes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:&nbsp; I would just refer
you to the Department of Justice with that.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with
the report.</p>
<p>COLIN POWELL, SECRETARY OF STATE:&nbsp; I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
have been detained.&nbsp; With respect to why they're being detained and
the other aspects of your question &#150; whether it's because they're
in intelligence services, or what they were doing &#150; I will defer
to the Department of Justice and the FBI to answer that.</p>
<p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p>
<p>CAMERON:&nbsp; Beyond the 60 apprehended or detained, and many deported
since Sept. 11, another group of 140 Israeli individuals have been arrested
and detained in this year in what government documents describe as&nbsp;
&quot;an organized intelligence gathering operation,&quot; designed to
&quot;penetrate government facilities.&quot;&nbsp; Most of those individuals
said they had served in the Israeli military, which is compulsory there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But they also had, most of them, intelligence expertise, and either worked
for Amdocs or other companies in Israel that specialize in wiretapping.&nbsp;
Earlier this week, the Israeli embassy in Washington denied any spying
against or in the United States &#150; Tony.</p>
<p>SNOW:&nbsp; Carl, we've heard the comments from Ari Fleischer and Colin
Powell.&nbsp; What are officials saying behind the scenes?</p>
<p>CAMERON:&nbsp; Well, there's real pandemonium described at the FBI,&nbsp;
the DEA and the INS.&nbsp; A lot of these problems have been well known
to some&nbsp; investigators, many of who have contributed to the reporting
on this&nbsp; story.&nbsp; And what they say is happening is supervisors
and management are&nbsp; now going back and collecting much of the information,
because there's&nbsp; tremendous pressure from the top levels of all of
those agencies to find&nbsp; out exactly what's going on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At the DEA and the FBI already a variety of administration reviews are&nbsp;
under way, in addition to the investigation of the phenomenon.&nbsp; They
want&nbsp; to find out how it is all this has come out, as well as be
very careful&nbsp; because of the explosive nature and very political
ramifications of the&nbsp; story itself &#150; Tony. </p>
<p>SNOW:&nbsp; All right, Carl, thanks.&nbsp; </p>

When corrupting politicians , police/military figures or industrialists it is so easy based on human vices it will be the job of Whistle-blowers to be the real heroes .
If you know and have the undisputed proof of anything related to the Fox revelations than please be a hero and bring ( carefully for your life – make lots of copies ) that info forward .
Best wishes to the American people because they are in deep trouble .

It is not just America suffering in the blood of corruption and deceit but every single country in the world faces it too. As America is where it is currently in question from the public as well as mostly focused on, then America is without a doubt the best place to prove that the media is also aiding in its corruption. Your work is greatly appreciated not only in the eyes of the Americans but to anyone around the world willing to listen and take into consideration this problem most of us fail to come to terms with. People like ourselves must stand united throughout the planet to undertake tasks not fit for the weak minded. We must change the mind and the heart of the people if our goal is to be reached. <strong>Power to the people.</strong> </div>
