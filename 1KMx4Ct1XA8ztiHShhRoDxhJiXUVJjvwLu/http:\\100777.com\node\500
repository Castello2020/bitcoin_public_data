<dt>"Every time we do something you tell me America
will do this and will do that . . . I want to tell you something very
clear: Don't worry about American pressure on Israel. <a href="/usa/">We,

2001, to Shimon Peres, as reported on Kol Yisrael radio. </dt>

<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>In 1923, radical Zionist Ze'ev Jabotinsky--
spiritual father of not only of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
but of Brooklyn Rabbi Meir Kahane-- wrote that the "sole way" for Jews
to deal with Arabs in Palestine was through "total avoidance of all
attempts to arrive at a settlement"-which Jabotinsky euphemistically
termed the "iron wall" approach. Not coincidentally, a picture of
Jabotinsky graces Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's desk. Source: The
Village Voice, "Death Wish in the Holy Land," Dec. 12, 2001 </dt>

<dt>During a sermon preceding the 2001 Passover
holiday, the influential Israeli Rabbi Ovadia Yosef exclaimed: "May the
Holy Name visit retribution on the Arab heads, and cause their seed to
be lost, and annihilate them." He added: "It is forbidden to have pity
on them. We must give them missiles with relish, annihilate them. Evil
ones, damnable ones." Source: Ha'aretz April 12, 2001 </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"We declare openly that the Arabs have no right to
settle on even one centimeter of Eretz Israel...Force is all they do or
ever will understand. We shall use the ultimate force until the
Palestinians come crawling to us on all fours."-Rafael Eitan, chief of
staff of the Israel Defense Forces, quoted in Yediot Ahronot, April 13,
1983, and The New York Times, April 14, 1983. </dt>

<dt>"We must do everything to ensure they [the
Palestinian refugees] never do return."-David Ben-Gurion, in his diary,

Prophet," Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 157. </dt>

Galilee of its Arab population."-Israel Koenig, "The Koenig Memorandum."<br/>

<dt>"We shall reduce the Arab population to a community
of woodcutters and waiters."-Uri Lubrani, Israeli Prime Minister
Ben-Gurion's special adviser on Arab Affairs. Source: "The Arabs in

<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"...the need to sustain the character of the state
which will henceforth be <a href="/jewry/">Jewish</a>...with a
non-Jewish minority limited to 15 percent. I had already reached this
fundamental position as early as 1940 [and] it is entered in my

Department. From "Israel: an Apartheid State" by Uri Davis, p. 5.

15, 1998. </dt>

<dt><a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbi</a>
Yitzhak Ginsburg, head of the Kever Yossev Yeshiva (school of <a href="/title/talmud">Talmud</a>) in Nablus stated, "The blood of the
Jewish people is loved by the Lord; it is therefore redder and their
life is preferable." </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>The four - Michael Ben-Chorin, Netanel Uzari, Yoel
Lerner, and Yosef Dayan - issued the book in honor of Goldstein who
slaughtered 40 Palestinian men and boys while they knelt in prayer in
the Ibrahimi Mosque at Hebron's Machpela Cave, on Purim 1994. (Purim is
the Jewish commemoration of vengeance against non-Jews). </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>The book, Baruch Hagever ("The Blessed Man"), has
sold thousands of copies among Jews, and includes an article written by
Rabbi Yitzhak Ginsburg, the head of an Israeli yeshiva (religious
school). Ginsburg's article "sings the praises" of the killer and calls
<a href="/title/goldstein">Goldstein</a>, a 'saint.' "The entire book
is indeed full of his praises. It should be noted that no Israeli <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">rabbi</a> (including the 'moderates'
among them) has said a word against the contents of the book." </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Ginsburg declares in Baruch Hagever that what <a href="/title/goldstein">Goldstein</a> did in murdering the unarmed
Palestinian civilians at their house of worship, constitutes, "a
fulfillment of a number of commands of <a href="/jewry/">Jewish</a>
religious law...Among his (Goldstein's) good deeds, as enumerated,
are...taking revenge on non-Jews, extermination of the non-Jews who are
from the seed of Amalek...and the sanctification of the Holy Name.
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"The murders have led, in the <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">rabbi's</a> opinion, to...clear
knowledge among the Jews that 'the life of a Jew is preferable to the
life of a non-Jew'... </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"Goldstein is indeed being worshipped as a saint in
(the Jewish settlement ) Kiryat Arba. His intercession before God is
asked by pilgrims and it is reported that he cures the ill and
generally helps those <a href="/jewry/">Jews</a> who ask his help."
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>The Israeli Chief <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbi</a> of the Sephardim, Eliahu
Bakshi Doron, in a radio broadcast on Tuesday, July 9, 1996, praised
the Biblical figure Phinehas for having killed the Israelite Zimri,
because Zimri had sex with a Midianite woman. Rabbi Doron said that
Phinehas had committed a "pure" act. He then referred to Zimri as "the
first reform Jew." </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Yediot Aharonot reports that Lederman had only
served two years of his murder sentence when then Israeli Chief of
Staff Rafael Eitan, who once compared Palestinians to "cockroaches
scurrying in a bottle," pardoned and released him. Two years later,
Lederman snatched a baby out of the arms of a Palestinian mother .
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>In his own defense, Rabbi Hecht stated, "All I said
was that according to <a href="/law/">Jewish law</a>, any one
person--you can apply it to whoever you want--any one person who
willfully, consciously, intentionally hands over human bodies or human
property or the human wealth of the Jewish people to an alien people is
guilty of the sin for which the penalty is death. </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"And, according to Maimonides--you can quote me--it
says very clearly, if a man kills him, he has done a good deed."<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp; BEITUNYA, West
Bank --Israeli motorists sprayed a group of Palestinian high school
students with bullets from American-issued assault weapons on Thursday,
Sept. 17, killing one youth and wounding another, witnesses and doctors
said.&nbsp; <br/>
The eyewitnesses said the motorists shot without
provocation. The shooting occurred around noon in the West Bank village
of Beitunia.&nbsp; Witnesses said about 10 high
school students were walking along the main road on their way home from
school when a vehicle with Israeli license plates pulled up near them.&nbsp;
The passengers rolled down their windows and began
firing from a pistol and an assault rifle, said Raed Abdel Rahman, 17,
one of the students who escaped injury. "Everybody started to jump and
take cover," said Rahman.&nbsp; A high school
student who was also on the scene, Hassan al-Qadi, told reporters,
"They were shooting randomly."&nbsp; The
wounded were taken to nearby Ramallah Hospital. Iyad Rahwa Qarabsi, 17,
a high school senior described as an outstanding student, was shot in
the stomach. He died at the hospital about an hour later, according to
Ramallah hospital director Shauke Harb.&nbsp; A
doctor described the cause of death as bullet wounds from an M-16, an
American-made, military assault rifle that Israeli settlers and
soldiers carry.&nbsp; 15 year-old Mahmoud Issa
Jabarin was in stable condition; also with a stomach wound, hospital
officials said.&nbsp; At the family home,
Qarabsi's mother collapsed on the floor and wept over the murder of her
teenage son. "My beloved, you didn't come home with your schoolbooks
today!" she sobbed.&nbsp; Ibrahim Murar, the
principal of Beitunya's 700-student Palestinian high school said, ""He
was one of the very best students in the school. School was more
important to him than anything else."&nbsp; After
being held in custody for three days, the Jewish gunman, Avshalom
Ladani, 35, a member of the West Bank settlement of Dolev, was released
by Israeli authorities. Ladani immediately joined a party at a
Jerusalem hotel where he was feted as a hero.&nbsp; "We call on all [Jewish] residents to view Avshalom's
behavior as upstanding citizenship," declared an advertisement placed
in Israeli newspapers by the Yesha Council, a settlers' group. The ad
said the Jewish killer was being "persecuted."&nbsp; Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu refused to condemn
the shootings of the Palestinian students. According to the Sept. 21
Washington Post, "His aides pleaded extenuating circumstances..." They
said the killer had been "provoked."&nbsp; Israeli
officials said the shooting was not an act of Jewish terrorism; they
termed the settler's action merely "carelessness," and "violence that
was disproportionate."&nbsp; "This sounds to me
like it was really an act of self-defense, if perhaps a careless one,"
said David Bar-Illan, an adviser to Netanyahu.&nbsp; A second Israeli gunman remains at large.&nbsp; This is the second shooting within two days in which
Israelis killed or wounded Palestinian youths. On Tuesday, Sept. 15, a
Jewish settler shot and wounded 16-year-old Mohammed Musa Dweik in the
Palestinian village of Zatara.&nbsp; In
America, one of the most zealous supporters of the gun-toting Israeli
settlers and their right to automatic weapons banned in the U.S., is
Brooklyn Congressman Charles E. Schumer.Schumer
helped promote and pass the the Federal government's assault weapons
ban, which outlawed the sale to the American people of 19 types of
semiautomatic weapons, many of which are possessed by Israeli settlers.
Schumer has stated, "I have made it (gun control) one of my life's
works..."&nbsp; Except in Israeli-occupied
Palestine.<br/>

<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Reporters Beaten Outside
Courthouse By Jewish Vigilantes </dt>
<dt>Feb 28, 1998 </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Paris, France, - Two Arab reporters have complained
to the French foreign ministry that they were attacked by Zionist
terrorists at the trial of French writer Roger Garaudy, a ministry
spokesman said on Saturday. </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Abdallah Hassan, who works for the Egyptian news
agency MENA, and Sayyed Hamdi, working for Saudi television, said they
were beaten on Friday by two assailants near the Paris law courts.
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>They said the attack occurred shortly after
Garaudy, 84, was fined 120,000 francs ($20,000) for questioning stories
of homicidal gas chambers in his book ``The Founding Myths of Israeli
Politics.'' </dt>
<dt>An Iranian reporter said he and his cameraman were
also set upon by a crowd of Jewish youths following the verdict,
although the foreign ministry said it had not yet received a complaint
about this attack. </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Foreign ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said he
``regretted'' the incidents and wished the injured reporters ``a swift
recovery.'' He added that police were carrying out an investigation.
</dt>
<dt>French television reported that a militant Jewish
youth organisation, Betar-Tagar, had released a statement indicating
that it had taken part in the violence. </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"...the deniers were punished,'' it quoted the
statement as saying. Zionists refer to those who question the details
of World War II Jewish accounts, as "deniers." </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Garaudy, a convert to Islam who has become a hero
for many Arab intellectuals, argued in his book that Hitler's
persecution of Jews had been greatly exaggerated. </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>He also wrote that "the myth of the extermination
of six million Jews'' had become a dogma justifying Israel's repression
of Palestinians, and he alleged that western media were 95 percent
controlled by Zionists. </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"We were reporting the sentencing of Garaudy
yesterday when we were attacked by a pro-Zionist group,'' the Iranian
reporter told French television. ``A group of about 10 to 15 youths
attacked me and the cameraman. They tried to prevent us reporting the
trial by pulling down the microphone and camera,'' he added.</dt>

<dt style="font-weight: bold;">Chief Rabbi Urged
Israeli Army To Destroy Mosque </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>January 2, 1998 </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Last December, when two Jewish terrorists were
arrested for allegedly plotting to throw a pig's head onto the Temple
Mount - an act of provocation intended to coincide with Ramadan prayers
at the al-Aksa and Omar mosques there - Yasser Arafat noted that, "many
times, we have warned of the attempts of Israeli extremists to defile
al-Aksa and destroy it". </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Indeed, over the years, several Jewish radicals
have been jailed for planning to blow up <a href="http://jahtruth.net/nomos.htm">the mosques</a>, as a prelude to the
rebuilding of a Jewish Temple of Herod on the site. </dt>
<dt>Now evidence has emerged of a more mainstream call
for their destruction - a call issued by the chief rabbi of the Israeli
army, Rabbi Shlomo Goren, just hours after Israel captured the Old City
during the Six-Day War of 1967. </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>According to information that has come to light
this week, the late Rabbi Goren, urged Uzi Narkiss, the commander of
the Israeli troops in the Old City, to "put 100 kilograms of explosives
into <a href="http://jahtruth.net/nomos.htm">the mosque</a>, so that we
may rid ourselves of it once and for all". <a href="http://jahtruth.net/nomos.htm">The mosque</a> is the holiest shrine
in Islam, after <a href="http://jahtruth.net/mecca.htm">Mecca</a> and
Medina. </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Major General Narkiss, who died last month,
discussed the conversation in an interview conducted a year ago, but
insisted it not be published while he was alive. He recalled that he
firmly rejected <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbi</a> Goren's
suggestion, but that the rabbi was persistent: "Uzi, you'll go down in
history if you do this," <a href="http://jahtruth.net/rabbis.htm">Rabbi</a>
Goren told him, "You don't realize what tremendous significance this
would have. </dt>

<dt>"Foreign Minister Shimon Peres is very worried
about the expected international reaction as soon as the world learns

that Israeli Defense Force (IDF) officers have similar worries: "The

something very </dt>

Israel. </dt>

<dt>to Shimon Peres, as reported on Kol Yisrael radio.
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>Ben-Gurion stated in 1937, during the Arab revolt:
</dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"This is a national war declared upon us by the
Arabs. ... This is an active resistance by the Palestinians to what
they regard as a usurpation of their homeland by the Jews. ...But the
fighting is only one aspect of the conflict, which is in its essence a
political one. And politically we are the aggressors and they defend
themselves." </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"The Israelis are becoming increasingly like the
white supremacist South Africans, viewing the Palestinians as a lower
form of life, not hesitating to kill a great many of them." </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"You cannot define the loss of human life in terms
of the number of Israelis killed by brutal, savage, inexcusable
Palestinian terror. And it does take place. The fact of the matter is
that three times as many Palestinians have been killed, and a
relatively small number of them were really militants. Most were
civilians. Some hundreds of children." --Zbigniew Brzezinski </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"A partial Jewish State is not the end, but only
the beginning. I am certain that we can not be prevented from settling
in the other parts of the country and the region." --David Ben Gurion,
in a letter to his son, 1937 </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"Between ourselves it must be clear that there is
no room for both peoples together in this country. We shall not achieve
our goal if the Arabs are in this small country." </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"There is no other way than to transfer the Arabs
from here to neighboring countries - all of them. Not one village, not
one tribe should be left." --Joseph Weitz, the head of the Jewish
Agencys Colonization Department, which was responsible for the actual
organization of settlements in Palestine, 1940 </dt>
<dt>&nbsp; </dt>
<dt>"We must use terror, assassination, intimidation,
