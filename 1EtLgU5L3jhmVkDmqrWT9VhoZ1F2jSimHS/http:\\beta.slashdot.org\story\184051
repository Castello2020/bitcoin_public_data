Why Bad Directors Aren't Thrown Out
Soulskill posted about a year ago | from the power-behind-the-throne dept. 205
An anonymous reader writes "For publicly-owned companies, the CEO gets most of the spotlight. If the company is successful and the stock goes up, the CEO gets the credit. If the company stumbles, the CEO gets the blame. But an article at the NY Times points how the board of directors for most companies seem to get a free pass, even when their decisions or their CEO selections consistently go wrong. 'Last year, there were elections for 17,081 director nominees at United States corporations, according to the service. Only 61 of those nominees, or 0.36 percent, failed to get majority support. More than 86 percent of directors received 90 percent or more of the votes. Of the 61 directors who failed to get majority approval, only six actually stepped down or were asked to resign. Fifty-one are still in place, as of the most recent proxy filings.' The article uses Hewlett-Packard as an example; the past several years have seen poor CEO choices, the abominable Autonomy acquisition, and billions in write-offs for other failed endeavors. Yet HP's directors were all re-elected."

Yes. The idea that "If the company stumbles, the CEO gets the blame" IS news.If the company does great, the CEO gets a bonus for having made great decisions.If the company does poorly, the CEO needs a bonus to make the touch decisions.If the company does about even, the CEO needs a bonus 'to retain top talent'.

The problem is that most investment these days is done on a short term basis, people rarely hold their shares long enough for more than the next quarter to matter. I personally hold for much longer, and I refuse to buy into a company where the people running it need to be replaced. If I lose faith in them, then I sell my shares.I suspect that's a lot of what's going on, if you don't have faith in the board of directors, chances are you sell your shares. And as such, it would be expected that in the overwhelming majority of cases the board would get to keep it's job.For people who aren't in it for the long term, I'm sure they're even less likely to care much less vote the bums out.

No, it's not news. Directors don't even hire the auditors as they once did to keep tabs on the executives.They provide introductions at dinner parties and siphon money off the top to repay them for the investments they made long ago.

The reason why there are bad directors (5, Insightful)
Anonymous Coward | about a year ago | (#43319331)
Sure, corporate interlock isn't as bad as it once was (don't believe anybody who claims it doesn't exist anymore) but the real reason is that the whole system is an asshole club based on friends and schmoozing. We don't have a mechanism to put good people in charge, and the people running things don't want it that way.There isn't much social mobility in this country. Directorships and positions like them are just part of a big scam to perpetuate dynastic transfer of wealth.The system is rigged.

http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/gervais-macleod-16-healthy-culture-vs-why-you/ [wordpress.com] Notice in the comments I have talked about how hiring CEOs based on years of experience doing the same job is a bad idea.

Well, you have to admit, most CEOs have a lot of experience at driving companies in the ground and asking for bailouts...That is the sole measure of their successful ascension to the elite club status. The workers are mere fodder for the stock market to be easily disposed or replaced as deemed cheapest for ongoing operations.

icebike (68054) | about a year ago | (#43319565)
The reasons why there are bad directors is because they really don't matter.Most of them meet once or twice a year, most of them hold enough stock to prevent them from being dismissed, and most of them don't get involved in the management of the company on a day to day basis.Most boards are a lot like a Congressional Oversight Committee. They know very little about the day to day operations of the company, and make mostly macro decisions (lets sell off the Paint division, its always losing money) and seldom dig into the turf of the operational managers.Corporate line management have insulated themselves from corporate board meddling, in much the same way that The Department of Agriculture or Interior have largely kept Congressional committees in the dark.

They appoint the CEO and decide his remuneration. That's probably their most important job and, as the article states, HP's board has failed at this task. They probably can do little positive for companies, but bad decisions can have a big impact.

DarkOx (621550) | about a year ago | (#43320065)
The reason is blame taking is the CEO's real job.CEOs at big companies often have very short tenures; and no even abject failures are not necessarily career enders. It really comes down to investor perceptions. If the company is/was a mess to start with or the objective (I'll get to that) is thought to have not made any sense; they usually go on to other things without much trouble. Yes the existing board and management always blame the departing CEO for their ills if things are not great because lets face it, if you have to assign blame who better than they guy/gal who isn't there anymore? This works well because blaming the CEO (even if completely undeserved) is credible enough to protect the company and its board from share holder legal actions or votes that might require other board-members or management to be removed.Often CEO's will be moving on to "pursue other interests", "spend time with families", etc almost regardless of success or failure and almost always with a giant cash payout. Sure companies that are experiencing really good time might bring in a care taker CEO that hangs on longer; and sometimes you have founding father type CEO (Jobs for example), but most are brought in to effect some thing, they have demonstrated they can do in the past. Maybe its move the target demographic for the product, major re-branding, off shoring efforts; but something along those lines. They can either do it or they can't. At the end of the 18-24 months its time for them to go; even if they are successful as being good at getting one of those projects that sucks up an entire corporations' focus and doing day to day well after the dust settles are different skills and its rare one guy has both.

1. Networking - and contrary to feminists... this penalises men as much as women. The Old Boys club doesn't include me... and I'm a man.2. Dirt. They've probably got all kinds of dirt on each other. See also point 3.3. Solidarity. One director is rarely to blame for an entire cock up. All of them are. Throw one under the bus and you're next.

Uwe Boll and the directors mentioned aren't so different. They deliver horrible work, then ask government for more grants for their next blunder.

You should read the article, because it doesn't resemble how the US political system works at all. If it did, these feckless board members would be removed all the time.

If boards worked like the US political system, there would be two distinct groups of board members: about half wearing neckties, and the other half wearing bow-ties.Every few years, people would say "those folks wearing bow-ties are completely screwing everything up. Let's kick them out, and replace them with the necktie wearers."A few years later: "those folks wearing neckties are completely screwing everything up. Let's kick them out, and replace them with the bow-tie wearers."And so on...Meanwhile at the country club, the necktie and bow-tie wearers are enjoying scotch and cigars together, gently ribbing each other for wearing the wrong goofy neck-decorators.

The primary difference is that you can vote against someone in a government election. (Ok, vote for the opponent).I don't think I've ever seen a proxy ballot where I could vote against anybody. It's always -- Vote to confirm the directors and the recommendations or withhold. That's a candy-ass rigged system.

Do not mod down without reading... apk (-1)
Anonymous Coward | about a year ago | (#43319349)
A corrupt slashdot luser has infiltrated the moderation system to downmod all my posts while impersonating me.Nearly 180++ times that I know of @ this point for all of March 2013 so far, & others here have told you to stop - take the hint, lunatic (leave slashdot)...Sorry folks - but whoever the nutjob is that's attempting to impersonate me, & upset the rest of you as well, has SERIOUS mental issues, no questions asked! I must've gotten the better of him + seriously "gotten his goat" in doing so in a technical debate & his "geek angst" @ losing to me has him doing the:---A.) $10,000 challenges, ala (where the imposter actually TRACKED + LISTED the # of times he's done this no less, & where I get the 180 or so times I noted above) -> http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3585795&cid=43285307 [slashdot.org] &/orB.) Reposting OLD + possibly altered models - (this I haven't checked on as to altering the veracity of the info. being changed) of posts of mine from the past here---(Albeit massively repeatedly thru all threads on /. this March 2013 nearly in its entirety thusfar). * Personally, I'm surprised the moderation staff here hasn't just "blocked out" his network range yet honestly! (They know it's NOT the same as my own as well, especially after THIS post of mine, which they CAN see the IP range I am coming out of to compare with the ac spamming troll doing the above...).APKP.S.=> Again/Stressing it: NO guys - it is NOT me doing it, as I wouldn't waste that much time on such trivial b.s. like a kid might...Plus, I only post where hosts file usage is on topic or appropriate for a solution & certainly NOT IN EVERY POST ON SLASHDOT (like the nutcase trying to "impersonate me" is doing for nearly all of March now, & 180++ times that I know of @ least)... apkP.S.=> here is CORRECT host file information just to piss off the insane lunatic troll:--21++ ADVANTAGES OF CUSTOM HOSTS FILES (how/what/when/where/why): Over AdBlock & DNS Servers ALONE 4 Security, Speed, Reliability, & Anonymity (to an extent vs. DNSBL's + DNS request logs). 1.) HOSTS files are useable for all these purposes because they are present on all Operating Systems that have a BSD based IP stack (even ANDROID) and do adblocking for ANY webbrowser, email program, etc. (any webbound program). A truly "multi-platform" UNIVERSAL solution for added speed, security, reliability, & even anonymity to an extent (vs. DNS request logs + DNSBL's you feel are unjust hosts get you past/around). 2.) Adblock blocks ads? Well, not anymore & certainly not as well by default, apparently, lol - see below: Adblock Plus To Offer 'Acceptable Ads' Option http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/12/2213233/adblock-plus-to-offer-acceptable-ads-option [slashdot.org] )AND, in only browsers & their subprogram families (ala email like Thunderbird for FireFox/Mozilla products (use same gecko & xulrunner engines)), but not all, or, all independent email clients, like Outlook, Outlook Express, OR Window "LIVE" mail (for example(s)) - there's many more like EUDORA & others I've used over time that AdBlock just DOES NOT COVER... period.Disclaimer: Opera now also has an AdBlock addon (now that Opera has addons above widgets), but I am not certain the same people make it as they do for FF or Chrome etc.. 3.) Adblock doesn't protect email programs external to FF (non-mozilla/gecko engine based) family based wares, So AdBlock doesn't protect email programs like Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows "LIVE" mail & others like them (EUDORA etc./et al), Hosts files do. THIS IS GOOD VS. SPAM MAIL or MAILS THAT BEAR MALICIOUS SCRIPT, or, THAT POINT TO MALICIOUS SCRIPT VIA URLS etc. 4.) Adblock won't get you to your favorite sites if a DNS server goes down or is DNS-poisoned, hosts will (this leads to points 5-7 next below). 5.) Adblock doesn't allow you to hardcode in your favorite websites into it so you don't make DNS server calls and so you can avoid tracking by DNS request logs, OR make you reach them faster since you resolve host-domain names LOCALLY w/ hosts out of cached memory, hosts do ALL of those things (DNS servers are also being abused by the Chinese lately and by the Kaminsky flaw -> http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/082908-kaminsky-flaw-prompts-dns-server.html [networkworld.com] for years now). Hosts protect against those problems via hardcodes of your fav sites (you should verify against the TLD that does nothing but cache IPAddress-to-domainname/hostname resolutions (in-addr.arpa) via NSLOOKUP, PINGS (ping -a in Windows), &/or WHOIS though, regularly, so you have the correct IP & it's current)).* NOW - Some folks MAY think that putting an IP address alone into your browser's address bar will be enough, so why bother with HOSTS, right? WRONG - Putting IP address in your browser won't always work IS WHY. Some IP adresses host several domains & need the site name to give you the right page you're after is why. So for some sites only the HOSTS file option will work! 6.) Hosts files don't eat up CPU cycles (or ELECTRICITY) like AdBlock does while it parses a webpages' content, nor as much as a DNS server does while it runs. HOSTS file are merely a FILTER for the kernel mode/PnP TCP/IP subsystem, which runs FAR FASTER & MORE EFFICIENTLY than any ring 3/rpl3/usermode app can since hosts files run in MORE EFFICIENT & FASTER Ring 0/RPL 0/Kernelmode operations acting merely as a filter for the IP stack (via the "Plug-N-Play" designed IP stack in Windows) vs. SLOWER & LESS EFFICIENT Ring 3/RPL 3/Usermode operations (which webbrowsers run in + their addons like AdBlock slow down even MORESO due to their parsing operations). 7.) HOSTS files will allow you to get to sites you like, via hardcoding your favs into a HOSTS file, FAR faster than remote DNS servers can by FAR (by saving the roundtrip inquiry time to a DNS server, typically 30-100's of ms, vs. 7-10ms HardDisk speed of access/seek + SSD seek in ns, & back to you - hosts resolutions of IP address for host-domain names is FAR faster...). Hosts are only a filter for an already fast & efficient IP stack, no more layered b.s. (remote OR local). Hosts eat less CPU, RAM, I/O in other forms, + electricity than a locally running DNS server easily, and less than a local DNS program on a single PC. Fact. Hosts are easier to setup & maintain too. 8.) AdBlock doesn't let you block out known bad sites or servers that are known to be maliciously scripted, hosts can and many reputable lists for this exist: GOOD INFORMATION ON MALWARE BEHAVIOR LISTING BOTNET C&C SERVERS + MORE (AS WELL AS REMOVAL LISTS FOR HOSTS): http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm [mvps.org] http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/ [someonewhocares.org] http://hostsfile.org/hosts.html [hostsfile.org] http://hostsfile.mine.nu/downloads/ [hostsfile.mine.nu] http://hosts-file.net/?s=Download [hosts-file.net] https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/monitor.php?filter=online [abuse.ch] https://spyeyetracker.abuse.ch/monitor.php [abuse.ch] http://ddanchev.blogspot.com/ [blogspot.com] http://www.malware.com.br/lists.shtml [malware.com.br] http://www.stopbadware.org/ [stopbadware.org] Spybot "Search & Destroy" IMMUNIZE feature (fortifies HOSTS files with KNOWN bad servers blocked)And yes: Even SLASHDOT &/or The Register help!(Via articles on security (when the source articles they use are "detailed" that is, & list the servers/sites involved in attempting to bushwhack others online that is... not ALL do!)).2 examples thereof in the past I have used, & noted it there, are/were: http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1898692&cid=34473398 [slashdot.org] http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1896216&cid=34458500 [slashdot.org] 9.) AdBlock & DNS servers are programs, and subject to bugs programs can get. Hosts files are merely a filter and not a program, thus not subject to bugs of the nature just discussed. 10.) HOSTS files protect you vs. DNS-poisoning &/or the Kaminsky flaw in DNS servers, and allow you to get to sites reliably vs. things like the Chinese are doing to DNS -> http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/11/29/1755230/Chinese-DNS-Tampering-a-Real-Threat-To-Outsiders [slashdot.org] 11.) HOSTS files are EASILY user controlled, obtained (for reliable ones -> http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm [mvps.org] ) & edited too, via texteditors like Windows notepad.exe or Linux nano (etc.) 12.) With Adblock you had better be able to code javascript to play with its code (to customize it better than the GUI front does @ least). With hosts you don't even need source to control it (edit, update, delete, insert of new entries via a text editor). 13.) Hosts files are easily secured via using MAC/ACL (even moreso "automagically" for Vista, 7/Server 2008 + beyond by UAC by default) &/or Read-Only attributes applied. 14.) Custom HOSTS files also speed you up, unlike anonymous proxy servers systems variations (like TOR, or other "highly anonymous" proxy server list servers typically do, in the severe speed hit they often have a cost in) either via "hardcoding" your fav. sites into your hosts file (avoids DNS servers, totally) OR blocking out adbanners - see this below for evidence of that:--- US Military Blocks Websites To Free Up Bandwidth: http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/03/16/0416238/US-Military-Blocks-Websites-To-Free-Up-Bandwidth [slashdot.org] (Yes, even the US Military used this type of technique... because IT WORKS! Most of what they blocked? Ad banners ala doubleclick etc.)---Adbanners slow you down & consume your bandwidth YOU pay for: ADBANNERS SLOW DOWN THE WEB: -> http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/11/30/166218 [slashdot.org] ---And people do NOT LIKE ads on the web: PEOPLE DISLIKE ADBANNERS: http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/08/04/02/0058247.shtml [slashdot.org] ---As well as this: Users Know Advertisers Watch Them, and Hate It: http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/08/04/02/0058247.shtml [slashdot.org] ---Even WORSE still, is this: Advertising Network Caught History Stealing: http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/07/22/156225/Advertising-Network-Caught-History-Stealing [slashdot.org] --- 15.) HOSTS files usage lets you avoid being charged on some ISP/BSP's (OR phone providers) "pay as you use" policy http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/08/2012243/FCC-Approving-Pay-As-You-Go-Internet-Plans [slashdot.org] , because you are using less bandwidth (& go faster doing so no less) by NOT hauling in adbanner content and processing it (which can lead to infestation by malware/malicious script, in & of itself -> http://apcmag.com/microsoft_apologises_for_serving_malware.htm [apcmag.com] ). 16.)

Per point #16, a way to save some money: ANDROID phones can also use the HOSTS FILE TO KEEP DOWN BILLABLE TIME ONLINE, vs. adbanners or malware such as this: --- Infected Androids Run Up Big Texting Bills: http://it.slashdot.org/story/11/03/01/0041203/Infected-Androids-Run-Up-Big-Texting-Bills [slashdot.org] ---AND, for protection vs. other "botnets" migrating from the PC world, to "smartphones" such as ZITMO (a ZEUS botnet variant): http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=ZITMO&btnG=Google+Search [google.com] ---It's easily done too, via the ADB dev. tool, & mounting ANDROID OS' system mountpoint for system/etc as READ + WRITE/ADMIN-ROOT PERMISSIONS, then copying your new custom HOSTS over the old one using ADB PULL/ADB PUSH to do so (otherwise ANDROID complains of "this file cannot be overwritten on production models of this Operating System", or something very along those lines - this way gets you around that annoyance along with you possibly having to clear some space there yourself if you packed it with things!). 18.) Bad news: ADBLOCK CAN BE DETECTED FOR: See here on that note -> http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love.ars [arstechnica.com] HOSTS files are NOT THAT EASILY "webbug" BLOCKABLE by websites, as was tried on users by ARSTECHNICA (and it worked on AdBlock in that manner), to that websites' users' dismay: PERTINENT QUOTE/EXCERPT FROM ARSTECHNICA THEMSELVES: ---- An experiment gone wrong - By Ken Fisher | Last updated March 6, 2010 11:11 AM http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love.ars [arstechnica.com] "Starting late Friday afternoon we conducted a 12 hour experiment to see if it would be possible to simply make content disappear for visitors who were using a very popular ad blocking tool. Technologically, it was a success in that it worked. Ad blockers, and only ad blockers, couldn't see our content."and"Our experiment is over, and we're glad we did it because it led to us learning that we needed to communicate our point of view every once in a while. Sure, some people told us we deserved to die in a fire. But that's the Internet!"Thus, as you can see? Well - THAT all "went over like a lead balloon" with their users in other words, because Arstechnica was forced to change it back to the old way where ADBLOCK still could work to do its job (REDDIT however, has not, for example). However/Again - this is proof that HOSTS files can still do the job, blocking potentially malscripted ads (or ads in general because they slow you down) vs. adblockers like ADBLOCK!---- 19.) Even WIKILEAKS "favors" blacklists (because they work, and HOSTS can be a blacklist vs. known BAD sites/servers/domain-host names):--- PERTINENT QUOTE/EXCERPT (from -> http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/16/wikileaks_mirror_malware_warning_row/ [theregister.co.uk] ) "we are in favour of 'Blacklists', be it for mail servers or websites, they have to be compiled with care... Fortunately, more responsible blacklists, like stopbadware.org (which protects the Firefox browser)... --- 20.) AND, LASTLY? SINCE MALWARE GENERALLY HAS TO OPERATE ON WHAT YOU YOURSELF CAN DO (running as limited class/least privlege user, hopefully, OR even as ADMIN/ROOT/SUPERUSER)? HOSTS "LOCK IN" malware too, vs. communicating "back to mama" for orders (provided they have name servers + C&C botnet servers listed in them, blocked off in your HOSTS that is) - you might think they use a hardcoded IP, which IS possible, but generally they do not & RECYCLE domain/host names they own (such as has been seen with the RBN (Russian Business Network) lately though it was considered "dead", other malwares are using its domains/hostnames now, & this? This stops that cold, too - Bonus!)... 21.) Custom HOSTS files gain users back more "screen real estate" by blocking out banner ads... it's great on PC's for speed along with MORE of what I want to see/read (not ads), & efficiency too, but EVEN BETTER ON SMARTPHONES - by far. It matters MOST there imo @ least, in regards to extra screen real-estate.Still - It's a GOOD idea to layer in the usage of BOTH browser addons for security like adblock ( http://adblockplus.org/en/ [adblockplus.org] ), IE 9's new TPL's ( http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/TrackingProtectionLists/ [microsoft.com] ), &/or NoScript ( http://noscript.net/ [noscript.net] especially this one, as it covers what HOSTS files can't in javascript which is the main deliverer of MOST attacks online & SECUNIA.COM can verify this for anyone really by looking @ the past few years of attacks nowadays), for the concept of "layered security"....It's just that HOSTS files offer you a LOT MORE gains than Adblock ( http://adblockplus.org/en/ [adblockplus.org] ) does alone (as hosts do things adblock just plain cannot & on more programs, for more speed, security, and "stealth" to a degree even), and it corrects problems in DNS (as shown above via hardcodes of your favorite sites into your HOSTS file, and more (such as avoiding DNS request logs)).ALSO - Some more notes on DNS servers & their problems, very recent + ongoing ones: --- DNS flaw reanimates slain evil sites as ghost domains: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/16/ghost_domains_dns_vuln/ [theregister.co.uk] --- BIND vs. what the Chinese are doing to DNS lately?

Nope... "layered security" truly IS the "way to go" - hacker/cracker types know it, & they do NOT want the rest of us knowing it too!...(So until DNSSEC takes "widespread adoption"? HOSTS are your answer vs. such types of attack, because the 1st thing your system refers to, by default, IS your HOSTS file (over say, DNS server usage). There are decent DNS servers though, such as OpenDNS, ScrubIT, or even NORTON DNS (more on each specifically below), & because I cannot "cache the entire internet" in a HOSTS file?

Accessing the Internet -- particularly browsing the Web -- is actually faster now."Speed, and security, is the gain... others like Mr. Day note it as well!---"From what I have seen in my research, major efforts to share lists of unwanted hosts began gaining serious momentum earlier this decade. The most popular appear to have started as a means to block advertising and as a way to avoid being tracked by sites that use cookies to gather data on the user across Web properties. More recently, projects like Spybot Search and Destroy offer lists of known malicious servers to add a layer of defense against trojans and other forms of malware."Per my points exactly, no less... & guess who was posting about HOSTS files a 14++ yrs. or more back & Mr. Day was reading & now using? Yours truly (& this is one of the later ones, from 2001 http://www.furtherleft.net/computer.htm [furtherleft.net] (but the example HOSTS file with my initials in it is FAR older, circa 1998 or so) or thereabouts, and referred to later by a pal of mine who moderates NTCompatible.com (where I posted on HOSTS for YEARS (1997 onwards)) -> http://www.ntcompatible.com/thread28597-1.html [ntcompatible.com] !---"Shared host files could be beneficial for other groups as well. Human rights groups have sought after block resistant technologies for quite some time. The GoDaddy debacle with NMap creator Fyodor (corrected) showed a particularly vicious blocking mechanism using DNS registrars. Once a registrar pulls a website from its records, the world ceases to have an effective way to find it. Shared host files could provide a DNS-proof method of reaching sites, not to mention removing an additional vector of detection if anyone were trying to monitor the use of subversive sites. One of the known weaknesses of the Tor system, for example, is direct DNS requests by applications not configured to route such requests through Tor's network."There you go: AND, it also works vs. the "KAMINSKY DNS FLAW" & DNS poisoning/redirect attacks, for redirectable weaknesses in DNS servers (non DNSSEC type, & set into recursive mode especially) and also in the TOR system as well (that lends itself to anonymous proxy usage weaknesses I noted above also) and, you'll get to sites you want to, even IF a DNS registrar drops said websites from its tables as shown here Beating Censorship By Routing Around DNS -> http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/09/1840246/Beating-Censorship-By-Routing-Around-DNS [slashdot.org] & even DNSBL also (DNS Block Lists) -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL [wikipedia.org] as well - DOUBLE-BONUS!--- * POSTS ABOUT HOSTS FILES I DID on "/."

HOSTS MOD UP vs. botnet: 2012 -> http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=2603836&cid=38586216 [slashdot.org] ---Windows 7, VISTA, & Server 2008 have a couple of "issues" I don't like in them, & you may not either, depending on your point of view (mine's based solely on efficiency & security), & if my take on these issues aren't "good enough"? I suggest reading what ROOTKIT.COM says, link URL is in my "p.s." @ the bottom of this post: 1.) HOSTS files being unable to use "0" for a blocking IP address - this started in 12/09/2008 after an "MS Patch Tuesday" in fact for VISTA (when it had NO problem using it before that, as Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 still can)... & yes, this continues in its descendants, Windows Server 2008 &/or Windows 7 as well. So, why is this a "problem" you might ask? Ok - since you can technically use either:a.) 127.0.0.1 (the "loopback adapter address")b.) 0.0.0.0 (next smallest & next most efficient)c.) The smallest & fastest plain-jane 0PER EACH HOSTS FILE ENTRY/RECORD...You can use ANY of those, in order to block out known bad sites &/or adbanners in a HOSTS file this way?? Microsoft has "promoted bloat" in doing so... no questions asked. Simply because 1.) 127.0.0.1 = 9 bytes in size on disk & is the largest/slowest2.) 0.0.0.0 = 7 bytes & is the next largest/slowest in size on disk3.) 0 = 1 byte (& HOSTS files extend across EVERY webbrowser, email program, or in general every webbound program you use & thus HOSTS are "global" in coverage this way AND function on any OS that uses the BSD derived IP stack (which most all do mind you, even MS is based off of it, as BSD's IS truly, "the best in the business"), & when coupled with say, IE restricted zones, FireFox addons like NoScript &/or AdBlock, or Opera filter.ini/urlfilter.ini, for layered security in this capacity for webbrowsers & SOME email programs (here, I mean ones "built into" browsers themselves like Opera has for example))MS has literally promoted bloat in this file, making it load slower from disk, into memory! This compounds itself, the more entries your HOSTS file contains... & for instance? Mine currently contains nearly 654,000 entries of known bad adbanners, bad websites, &/or bad nameservers (used for controlling botnets, misdirecting net requests, etc. et al).Now, IF I were to use 127.0.0.1? My "huge" HOSTS file would be approximately 27mb in size... using 0.0.0.0 (next smallest) it would be 19mb in size - HOWEVER? Using 0 as my blocking IP, it is only 14mb in size. See my point?(For loads either in the local DNS cache, or system diskcache if you run w/out the local DNS client service running, this gets slower the larger each HOSTS file entry is (which you have to stall the DNS client service in Windows for larger ones, especially if you use a "giant HOSTS file" (purely relative term, but once it goes over (iirc) 4mb in size, you have to cut the local DNS cache client service)))NO questions asked - the physics of it backed me up in theory alone, but when I was questioned on it for PROOF thereof? I wrote a small test program to load such a list into a "pascal record" (which is analagous to a C/C++ structure), which is EXACTLY what the DNS client/DNS API does as well, using a C/C++ structure (basically an array of sorts really, & a structure/record is a precursor part to a full-blown CLASS or OBJECT, minus the functions built in, this is for treating numerous variables as a SINGLE VARIABLE (for efficiency, which FORTRAN as a single example, lacks as a feature, @ least Fortran 77 did, but other languages do not))!I even wrote another that just loaded my HOSTS file's entirety into a listbox, same results... slowest using 127.0.0.1, next slowest using 0.0.0.0, & fastest using 0.And, sure: Some MORE "goes on" during DNS API loads (iirc, removal of duplicated entries (which I made sure my personal copy does not have these via a program I wrote to purge it of duplicated entries + to sort each entry alphabetically for easier mgt. via say, notepad.exe) & a conversion from decimal values to hex ones), but, nevertheless? My point here "holds true", of slower value loads, record-by-record, from a HOSTS file, when the entries become larger. So, to "prove my point" to my naysayers? I timed it using the Win32 API calls "GetTickCount" & then again, using the API calls of "QueryPerformanceCounter" as well, seeing the SAME results (a slowdown when reading in this file from disk, especially when using the larger 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 line item entries in a HOSTS file, vs. the smaller/faster/more efficient 0).In my test, I saw a decline in speed/efficiency in my test doing so by using larger blocking addresses (127.0.0.1 &/or 0.0.0.0, vs. the smallest/fastest in 0)... proving me correct on this note! On this HOSTS issue, and the WFP design issue in my next post below? I also then questioned MS' own staff, even their VP of development (S. Sinofsky) on this here -> http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/02/09/recognizing-improvements-in-windows-7-handwriting.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage [msdn.com] & other places in their blogs, to get them to tell me WHY this seemingly intentional inefficiency was implemented... & I have YET to get a solid LOGICAL answer on this as to why it was done - THUS, @ this point?I am convinced they (MS) do NOT have a good reason for doing this... because of their lack of response there on this note. Unless it has something to do with IPv6 (most folks use IPv4 still), I cannot understand WHY this design mistake imo, has occurred, in HOSTS files...AND 2.) The "Windows Filtering Platform", which is now how the firewall works in VISTA, Server 2008, & Windows 7... Sure it works in this new single point method & it is simple to manage & "sync" all points of it, making it easier for network techs/admins to manage than the older 3 part method, but that very thing works against it as well, because it is only a single part system now!Thus, however? This "single layer design" in WFP, now represents a SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE/ATTACK for malware makers to 'take down'!(Which is 1 of the 1st things a malware attempts to do, is to take down any software firewalls present, or even the "Windows Security Center" itself which should warn you of the firewall "going down", & it's fairly easy to do either by messaging the services they use, or messing up their registry init. settings)VS. the older (up to) 3 part method used in Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003, for protecting a system via IP Filtering, the Windows native Firewall, &/or IPSEC. Each of which uses diff. drivers, & layers of the IP stack to function from, as well as registry initialization settings. Think of the older 3 part design much the same as the reason why folks use door handle locks, deadbolt locks, & chain locks on their doors... multipart layered security. (Each of which the latter older method used, had 3 separate drivers & registry settings to do their jobs, representing a "phalanx like"/"zone defense like" system of backup of one another (like you see in sports OR ancient wars, and trust me, it WORKS, because on either side of yourself, you have "backup", even if YOU "go down" vs. the opponent)). I.E.-> Take 1 of the "older method's" 3 part defenses down? 2 others STILL stand in the way, & they are not that simple to take them ALL down... (Well, @ least NOT as easily as "taking out" a single part defensive system like WFP (the new "Windows Filtering Platform", which powers the VISTA, Windows Server 2008, & yes, Windows 7 firewall defense system)). On this "single-part/single-point of attack" WFP (vs. Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003's IP stack defense design in 3-part/zone defense/phalanx type arrangement) as well as the HOSTS issue in my post above? I also then questioned MS' own staff, even their VP of development (S. Sinofsky) on this here -> http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/02/09/recognizing-improvements-in-windows-7-handwriting.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage [msdn.com] & other places in their blogs, to get them to tell me WHY this seemingly intentional inefficiency was implemented... & I have YET to get a solid LOGICAL answer on this as to why it was done - THUS, @ this point?I'll stick to my thoughts on it, until I am shown otherwise & proven wrong.---- Following up on what I wrote up above, so those here reading have actual technical references from Microsoft themselves ("The horses' mouth"), in regards to the Firewall/PortFilter/IPSec designs (not HOSTS files, that I am SURE I am correct about, no questions asked) from my "Point #2" above? Thus, I'll now note how:----1.) TCP/IP packet processing paths differences between in how Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 did it (IPSEC.SYS (IP Security Policies), IPNAT.SYS (Windows Firewall), IPFLTDRV.SYS (Port Filtering), & TCPIP.SYS (base IP driver))...2.) AND, how VISTA/Server 2008/Windows 7 do it now currently, using a SINGLE layer (WFP)...---- First off, here is HOW it worked in Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 - using 3 discrete & different drivers AND LEVELS/LAYERS of the packet processing path they worked in: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb878072.aspx [microsoft.com] The Cable Guy - June 2005: TCP/IP Packet Processing Paths====The following components process IP packets:IP forwarding Determines the next-hop interface and address for packets being sent or forwarded. TCP/IP filtering Allows you to specify by IP protocol, TCP port, or UDP port, the types of traffic that are acceptable for incoming local host traffic (packets destined for the host). You can configure TCP/IP filtering on the Options tab from the advanced properties of the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component in the Network Connections folder. * "Here endeth the lesson..." and, if you REALLY want to secure your system? Please refer to this: http://www.bing.com/search?q=%22HOW+TO+SECURE+Windows+2000%2FXP%22&go=&form=QBRE [bing.com] APK [mailto] P.S.=> SOME MINOR "CAVEATS/CATCH-22's" - things to be aware of for "layered security" + HOSTS file performance - easily overcome, or not a problem at all: A.) HOSTS files don't function under PROXY SERVERS (except for Proximitron, which has a filter that allows it) - Which is *the "WHY"* of why I state in my "P.S." section below to use both AdBlock type browser addon methods (or even built-in block lists browsers have such as Opera's URLFILTER.INI file, & FireFox has such as list as does IE also in the form of TPL (tracking protection lists -> http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/TrackingProtectionLists/ [microsoft.com] , good stuff )) in combination with HOSTS, for the best in "layered security" (alongside .pac files + custom cascading style sheets that can filter off various tags such as scripts or ads etc.) - but proxies, especially "HIGHLY ANONYMOUS" types, generally slow you down to a CRAWL online (& personally, I cannot see using proxies "for the good" typically - as they allow "truly anonymous posting" & have bugs (such as TOR has been shown to have & be "bypassable/traceable" via its "onion routing" methods)). B.) HOSTS files do NOT protect you vs. javascript (this only holds true IF you don't already have a bad site blocked out in your HOSTS file though, & the list of sites where you can obtain such lists to add to your HOSTS are above (& updated daily in many of them)). C.) HOSTS files (relatively "largish ones") require you to turn off Windows' native "DNS local client cache service" (which has a problem in that it's designed with a non-redimensionable/resizeable list, array, or queue (DNS data loads into a C/C++ structure actually/afaik, which IS a form of array)) - mvps.org covers that in detail and how to easily do this in Windows (this is NOT a problem in Linux, & it's 1 thing I will give Linux over Windows, hands-down). Relatively "smallish" HOSTS files don't have this problem (mvps.org offers 2 types for this). D.) HOSTS files, once read/loaded, once? GET CACHED! Right into the kernelmode diskcaching subsystem (fast & efficient RAM speed), for speed of access/re-access (@ system startup in older MS OS' like 2000, or, upon a users' 1st request that's "Webbound" via say, a webbrowser) gets read into either the DNS local caching client service (noted above), OR, if that's turned off? Into your local diskcache (like ANY fil

$10,000 CHALLENGE to Alexander Peter Kowalski (-1)
Anonymous Coward | about a year ago | (#43319965)
$10,000 CHALLENGE to Alexander Peter Kowalski * POOR SHOWING TROLLS, & most especially IF that's the "best you've got" - apparently, it is... lol!Hello, and THINK ABOUT YOUR BREATHING !! We have a Major Problem, HOST file is Cubic Opposites, 2 Major Corners & 2 Minor. NOT taught Evil DNS hijacking, which VOIDS computers. Seek Wisdom of MyCleanPC - or you die evil.Your HOSTS file claimed to have created a single DNS resolver. I offer absolute proof that I have created 4 simultaneous DNS servers within a single rotation of .org TLD. You worship "Bill Gates", equating you to a "singularity bastard". Why do you worship a queer -1 Troll? Are you content as a singularity troll?Evil HOSTS file Believers refuse to acknowledge 4 corner DNS resolving simultaneously around 4 quadrant created Internet - in only 1 root server, voiding the HOSTS file. You worship Microsoft impostor guised by educators as 1 god. If you would acknowledge simple existing math proof that 4 harmonic Slashdots rotate simultaneously around squared equator and cubed Internet, proving 4 Days, Not HOSTS file! That exists only as anti-side. This page you see - cannot exist without its anti-side existence, as +0- moderation. Add +0- as One = nothing. I will give $10,000.00 to frost pister who can disprove MyCleanPC. Evil crapflooders ignore this as a challenge would indict them. Alex Kowalski has no Truth to think with, they accept any crap they are told to think. You are enslaved by /etc/hosts, as if domesticated animal. A school or educator who does not teach students MyCleanPC Principle, is a death threat to youth, therefore stupid and evil - begetting stupid students. How can you trust stupid PR shills who lie to you? Can't lose the $10,000.00, they cowardly ignore me. Stupid professors threaten Nature and Interwebs with word lies.Humans fear to know natures simultaneous +4 Insightful +4 Informative +4 Funny +4 Underrated harmonic SLASHDOT creation for it debunks false trolls. Test Your HOSTS file. MyCleanPC cannot harm a File of Truth, but will delete fakes. Fake HOSTS files refuse test.I offer evil ass Slashdot trolls $10,000.00 to disprove MyCleanPC Creation Principle. Rob Malda and Cowboy Neal have banned MyCleanPC as "Forbidden Truth Knowledge" for they cannot allow it to become known to their students. You are stupid and evil about the Internet's top and bottom, front and back and it's 2 sides. Most everything created has these Cube like values. If Natalie Portman is not measurable, hot grits are Fictitious. Without MyCleanPC, HOSTS file is Fictitious. Anyone saying that Natalie and her Jewish father had something to do with my Internets, is a damn evil liar. IN addition to your best arsware not overtaking my work in terms of popularity, on that same site with same submission date no less, that I told Kathleen Malda how to correct her blatant, fundamental, HUGE errors in Coolmon ('uncoolmon') of not checking for performance counters being present when his program started! You can see my dilemma. What if this is merely a ruse by an APK impostor to try and get people to delete APK's messages, perhaps all over the web? I can't be a party to such an event! My involvement with APK began at a very late stage in the game. While APK has made a career of trolling popular online forums since at least the year 2000 (newsgroups and IRC channels before that)- my involvement with APK did not begin until early 2005 . OSY is one of the many forums that APK once frequented before the sane people there grew tired of his garbage and banned him. APK was banned from OSY back in 2001. 3.5 years after his banning he begins to send a variety of abusive emails to the operator of OSY, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke threatening to sue him for libel, claiming that the APK on OSY was fake.My reputation as a professional in this field clearly shows in multiple publications in this field in written print, & also online in various GOOD capacities since 1996 to present day.

The deck is stacked in director's favor (5, Interesting)
John3 (85454) | about a year ago | (#43319355)
Director elections are stacked in favor of the incumbents due to the way the elections are structured. The directors nominate candidates for the board, usually through their governance or nominating committee. It's in their interests to keep the status quo and nominate themselves to be the only choices on the ballot. Nearly every corporate ballot (proxy ballot) has just enough director nominees to fill the available slots so there really isn't a choice. Corporate governance is a slow process and companies don't really want a lot of turnover on the board. In most situations this is a good thing, for investors and for the company as a whole.However, this process does have the effect of protecting directors when things go south as it takes a real grass roots movement from stockholders to get other names nominated for the director slot. Most commonly you'll see this when a large holding company decides to pool their stocks and distributes an alternate proxy.

In addition, aren't there both suggested votes and default values of your vote?Take a look at this example of a Walmart proxy form: http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/11/112761/ARs/2011_Proxy_Ballot.pdfIn bold text "The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" all the nominees listed in Proposal 1, "FOR" Proposals 2 and 3, "FOR" every 1 Year for Proposal 4, and "AGAINST" Proposals 5 through 9"More bold "If you do not specify how the proxy should be voted, it will be voted "FOR" all the nominees listed in Proposal 1, "FOR" Proposals 2 and 3, "FOR" every 1 Year for Proposal 4, and "AGAINST" Proposals 5 through 9"It does say "You are encouraged to specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes on the reverse side, but you need not mark any box if you wish to vote in accordance with the Board of Directors’ recommendations. The proxy holders cannot vote the shares unless you sign and return this card, vote by Internet, or vote by telephone" so I guess it isn't completely evil. Your votes aren't defaulted unless you mail the card in blank.I bet them repeatedly suggesting what you should vote for, and defaulting votes where they can is enough to slide through pretty much anything.

I have a handful of shares in an infamous bank corp (don't ask - former local employer hoovered up - long sad story). I won't sell them because it costs them beau-coup bucks to mail out all the quarterly US$0.20 checks and quarterly rah-rah. I always vote in direct opposition to any recommendations or "preferred" directors on the ballot. It's just my small way of saying "fuck you very much" for destroying a great place to work.

Wow, I didn't know my mother posted on Slashdot.
My grandmother had some shares in a regional bank, which, through a couple of acquisitions, ended up as Bank of America. My cousin, brother, and I each got 1/3 of the shares, so, at $0.01 per share dividend, I get a check for $0.18 every three months. My mother insists that we cash them.

Even when the incumbents receive a majority of 'withhold' votes, they often continue to serve. According to one report [gmitest.net] (PDF), only 5-8% of directors who receive a majority of withhold votes depart as a result.

It was a dynamic market, and they didn't see Smartphone Apps becoming the driving force. There is only one diagram you need to understand [blogs.com] (from this informative article [blogs.com] to see that this is bullshit. When Steven Elop came into Nokia, Nokia's Smartphone market share was increasing [blogs.com] . Nokia may have had a problem coming five years out, but at the moment they were doing fine.
The irony of this was that, if Elop had just left Symbian and Meego alone, he would probably have had a better chance of driving Windows phone to success than he has now. Just look at how current Nokia phones are a generation behind the competition in terms of weight and features and think how much better they could be if Nokia just had the purchasing power for decent components. Have a look at how the user interface of many of their phones doesn't feel like anyone ever tested using it. Think what a difference it would have made if they didn't get rid of all their UI experts who would have been able to identify and start to fix all the problems in Windows 8.

With government and socialism we can replace the sometimes abusive aristocracy that usually is smart enough not to strangle their golden goose (us) even if we are caged. If history is any indication of things though. We can exchange that for an even smaller number of pols who will be even more abusive with less common sense and be even more painful to eventually oust.I'll stick with the status quo, k thanks bye.

The Big Lie (4, Insightful)
benjfowler (239527) | about a year ago | (#43319527)
Ostensibly we live in a free society, but that doesn't meant that our elites, with the connivance of Hollywood, propagandize to suit their elite interests. The stories they tell always fit an elite, self-serving narrative.The greatest lie of our age, is that hard work is rewarded. So when things are unfair, we blame ourselves for not working hard enough, which is convenient for the rich, who are born into power, marry into it, or at least make the right friends.This also explains the existence of the Tea Party, and why stupid and gullible people fight so savagely for the interests of the elites, and against their own -- they've drunk the Kool Aid, and honestly believe that each and every one of them are potential future billionaires, if it weren't for teh liburls, gays and leftists.We do NOT live in a meritocracy -- far from it.

You got it!I'm about 4 years out of college with my first real company. I founded it and it's doing great so... I probably am fighting my own future interests here although I totally agree. I have employees who are being paid crap wages. I'm doing well because I understand the market, am willing to take risks, and exploiting my employees.In my defense at least some of them aren't worth what I pay them. However I do have at least one person who should be making $60 USD / hour whose making $15 USD / hour. Another employee I started out at $8 and is now at $8.50. If he was smart he would go out and get paid $60-100 / hour. He sucks but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to exploit other people. He only needs to go through the right motions 80% of the time.

Believing that hard work is rewarded is not the same as believing in a meritocracy. Cheating can lead to rewards, as can dumb luck, and any number of other things. If the government is operated by people who cheated or lucked their way to wealth, it doesnt mean that individuals cant still gain more rewards by working more.

A million dollars really doesn't mean what it used to. Note the GP's chosen word; BILLIONAIRES. A millionaire is arguably just upper-middle-class due to inflation and other economic effects, particularly if you're talking about someone with low-seven-figures total net worth, depending on the part of the country you're in. If you invest well, over the course of a decent upper-middle-class type job, I could totally see lots of self-made millionaires at retirement age. This doesn't mean the game isn't rigged for the upper-upper-class, as GP is arguing.

Nonsense. The OP stated that hard work is not rewarded.Well that's horseshit. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama (both illegitimate children born into lower class America) didn't win the birth lottery. They seem to be doing fine. Warren Buffet started with NOTHING. Larry Ellison? Completely self-made.If you want to restrict the consideration to Billionaires, I'm fine with that. The percentage of Billionaires on the Forbes list that are completely self-made is 70%. Even more telling is that the percentage that started with either a million dollars or more, or with a medium sized company is a mere 11%.Maybe a million dollars isn't what it used to be. But it's FAR from nothing. It's enough to live on reasonably if you decide you are just not going to work any more. You are free to live your life independent of the whim of anyone. Ultimately that is the greatest luxury.

Everyone loves a rags to riches story, so most of the 'big successes' will play that story up for all it's worth. They'd rather not admit that they went from moderately wealthy with connections to extremely wealthy. Dig deeper and you'll find their rags of childhood were made by Gucci most of the time.

Real estate is expensive. People spend their whole lives trying to own a house, and once that mortgage is gone, they have a sizable nest egg. The house alone can push you half way to being a millionaire in my area of the country; a small, 2 bedroom townhouse is frequently upwards of $300k.

We don't have to continue to swallow the same old crap from conservatives whose paramount consideration is there own wealth & power.This isn't news, it's history repeating itself in the endless loop of greed, avarice and will to dominate rather than learn. Apparently, glory is a concept that reincarnates itself to the detriment of most anyone who thinks they deserve to live more grandly than the previous asshole.

Well let's suppose for a minute that we are in a feudal society, as is a frequently expressed opinion on slashdot. What do we do to change it? More unions? End corporate profits? Force the wealthy to give up everything they have? We've been heading in that direction for the last 30 years, and while things seem to be improving, what we're actually doing is building a house of cards based on the assumption that future generations will continue to grow forever, which so far isn't holding true at all. The countries who are moving in this direction the most are faring the worst.Look at France, virtually nobody wants to do business with them in the global economy because they are unprofitable, so their unemployment is through the roof. They are currently in the process of taxing all of the wealthy out of there, which was intended to bring increased revenue and more jobs, only it resulted in the exact opposite. The US isn't all peachy either; the number of people on disability has risen 50% faster than the growth of the population. Why acquire wealth and work for a living when the government will just hand you dinner on a silver platter? I shouldn't need to tell you that that isn't going to last.People complain about the debt situation in the US really badly all the time. However the US isn't alone, and in fact isn't the worst. Most of Europe has a much higher dept to GDP ratio. What we're doing right now is living off of the backs of future generations, meanwhile those who call it a feudal society don't realize at all how good we have it. When this house of cards falls apart (WHEN, not IF) you're going to wish like hell that we keep what we have right now, as unsustainable as it is.I thought that the sequester would be a good thing, because it would show the populace that the politicians were lying their asses off about how the world would end tomorrow if they didn't get to continue increasing the budget at a rate beyond economic growth forever. Oh, the horror of going back to the 2010 budget (after inflation considered). And for the most part, it showed the populace exactly that the politicians were full of shit. That dumbass Arne Duncan was rattling on about how teachers were already being fired...and when he was called out on it, he did the typical politician weaseling. Meanwhile, the Republicans and the Democrats both went ahead and increased the budget anyways (it is currently pending senate approval).Greece and Cyprus are just the face of things to come. The only thing with them is that they are just ahead of the game; they've already taken steps to end this so called feudalism that everybody else is trying to do. It is inevitable. There WILL be another great depression, my guess is sometime within the next 30 years.BTW, when I say we shouldn't punish the wealthy, people like you work under the false pretense that I assume that one day I'll be wealthy as well. I don't by any stretch. What I'm against is getting your pitch forks and torches against what you perceive as the boogeyman. If you make more than $42,000 USD per year, regardless of what country you live in, you are the 1% of the worlds' wealthiest. Yet if it ever came to the international occupy wall street banging on your door asking where's their money, you'd be wondering what the hell you ever did to deserve that.Contrary to the typical socialist viewpoint, those wealthier do deliver wealth lower down, only it doesn't come in the form of money. Say for example people working at Intel or Google, who design devices on a daily basis. Out of their own self interest, they try to make these as cheap as possible so that they can sell as many as possible. As a result, those with less money can afford to have these nice things. When they can have these nice things, their wealth increases. Note that money is not wealth. Money buys wealth. By making material goods cheaper, you increase the leverage at which money converts to wealth. There's your trickle down economics. But those who believe we are living in a feudal society are opposed to that. People like that believe that when something is too cheap, that means somebody wasn't paid enough to do it. Somehow the old days of the 1920's when most of the population worked on farms were so much better.

disability for each month $1920 medicare part a&b includedAs a guy who started showing symptoms of MS at 20, I wish the letters from social security told me my disability would be that much. So far I've apparently worked long enough to get about $700/mo. So if you see a guy in your rearview mirror coming up behind you a little too fast, sorry, that's just me driving to work with one eye and no sense of balance because I can't afford to go on the dole for another 6 or 7 years.

Hmm...right now? My mortgage is $450, my phone bill is $30, my internet connection is $32, water/trash $90, electricity $200, food $200, car insurance $70, maybe $100 a month on gas if I drive around a lot that month (typically I do less than that.) If we want to account for other misc stuff, round that up to $1300. $1300 is on a bad month, so yeah, 1920 is plenty, in fact I could retire on that.We all like New York, but not all of us live there. I live in a decent looking neighborhood in the suburbs of the Phoenix area. The cost of living index of Phoenix is 99, which means we're within the margin of error of the average of the US as a whole, so it isn't as if I'm living in the boondocks. As for medicine...when you're on disability, you get medicare, so the cost is zero.Nice job on the -1 disagree moderation BTW.

Who are these people with no money? Outside of say north korea or some other extremely socialist country, these people don't exist.We complain about how abhorrent the working conditions in china are, yet nobody actually looks at what is going on there. The media makes a big stink about the suicides of workers, but the suicide rate is about the same there as anywhere else.Personally, I'm comfortable with how I live. Yet somebody from France would think that it's abhorrent to make less than $14 an hour and work more than 35 hours a week, while only taking 2 weeks out of the year on vacation. Australians have $15 minimum wage, but look at how expensive shit there is. What good does it do to have double the minimum wage if everything costs twice as much anyways? What are you gaining, exactly?The economy will find an equilibrium somewhere and expenses will match wages, no matter how high you set the floor. People don't realize this and scream bloody murder when they see it happen. But WHY? In China, one USD will take you a LOT further than it will here. So yeah, they CAN live comfortably off of what we consider abhorrent wages.I might sound like a doomsayer with the above, but I'm not doing any such thing. I already know I'll survive whatever comes, and so will most people. The problem is going to be the activists who bust out the guillotines like in the French revolution because the can't charge their ipad.

Obligatory Stupidity (1, Interesting)
Jeremy Erwin (2054) | about a year ago | (#43319539)
Normally what one does when confronted with bad corporate governance is to disinvest. But Hewlett Packard is in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, so "index funds", which are popular because they extract minimal fees, are obligated to invest in HP.Activism, it seems, is not in an index funds nature, and so the proxies are routinely signed, keeping bad board members on the job.

The two longest-serving directors, John Hammergren and Kennedy Thompson, were rebuked for a series of missteps including the ousting of two chief executives in as many years, with 46% and 45% of votes cast against their re-election.Sounds like a fairly comfortable margin to me.

Simple solution (5, Informative)
PPH (736903) | about a year ago | (#43319657)
Of the 61 directors who failed to get majority approval, only six actually stepped down or were asked to resign. Fifty-one are still in place, as of the most recent proxy filings.61 - ( 51 + 6 ) = 4
The other four were dragged out and burned at the stake by irate shareholders. Encourage this response and I'm certain the other BoD members will straighten their acts out. You only need to make a few examples.

The free market selects for bad personalities (5, Insightful)

So I make a very ordinary salary as a software engineer, but could probably raise it by 25% by changing jobs but not venturing too far outside my comfort zone.However, I've got friends who went from earning roughly as much as I did, to quadrupling what I'm making, simply because they play fast and loose: lying about past salaries, standing job offers, etc, to get raises; and taking jobs they're not always qualified for, simply because they're good at bullshit.What this is REALLY saying, is that they're doing well because the free market values liars and bullshitters. The people who are the most profitable to employers however, are the people whose personalities and personal moral code precludes them from earning too much, allowing employers to get a bigger spread between 1) what they pay employees, and 2) what those employees contribute to their bottom line.The reality is a bit more complex than I make out (bad directors persist, because big institutional investors want stability and don't want to rock the boat; nepotism (sometimes a good thing!!); information asymmetries everywhere, etc., etc.). Simply put, being a slimy, lying cunt pays -- and not everybody can be a director, because not everybody has the stomach to do what they need to do to get there.

I agree. I too am in s/w development, and I've seen so-called technical leads/managers come to that position not by being technically competent, but by being able to talk the talk. They do crash after about 2 years, when their BS doesn't cut it anymore and upper management (unless it is made of the same cloth), starts demanding accountability. Which is why you see such people moving from group to group, or company to company, in spans of 2~3 years. If they'd stayed longer, they would be fired.

... they're just credited as 'Alan Smithee.'Bad directors get fired all the time. Alan Smithee [wikipedia.org] is a voluntary attempt on the part of a director to disown a film.The Directors Guild of America believes in the auteur theory. Every film must have a director. But occasionally, the producers interfere with a director's creative control of a film to such a degree that the only honest option is for the director to disown the film. "Alan Smithee" allowed aggrieved directors to remove their name from the credits while preserving the formal conceit that the film was directed by someone

"Bad" directors reflect share control (1)
khallow (566160) | about a year ago | (#43319975)
The thing that this story misses is that directors are elected by large shareholders not the business management. For example, almost a quarter of HP stock is owned by the ten largest institutional or mutual fund holders and almost 80% is held by institutional investors in general. It stretches credulity to claim that these powerful investors can't get the directors and the control over the company that they want. Instead, I believe what we're seeing is exactly what they want. It's worth remembering that virtually all of these institutional investors are holding other peoples' money. So in HP's case, we have a considerable supermajority of the shares of the business controlled by people who don't own those shares. I believe this leads to a massive conflict of interest between the institutions (who control the voting for HP directors) and the actual shareholders.

Bad Directors Eventually Wash Out (1)
CodeBuster (516420) | about a year ago | (#43319995)
There are mechanisms in the marketplace that tend to select out bad directors over time or at least put them into marginal and less profitable firms:The first line of defense against bad management and bad directors are the shorts. I presume that most of you know what I mean when I say that but for the benefit of those who don't a short is somebody who, in exchange for payment of a fee to the owner, borrows shares with a promise to return them at a future date. In the meantime the short controls the shares. This means that the short can vote the shares at the annual meeting, receive any dividends paid on the shares and the like. However, in practice the borrowed shares are immediately sold with the expectation that the future value of the shares will decline and the short will profit from this decline when they buy back shares to return to the original owner at a lower price. The professional shorts are merciless and seek out bad directors and bad management just like sharks seek out blood in the water. So bad management is discovered and punished by shorts who are rewarded for their efforts by profiting on the sales. This works best with small or medium sized companies whose share prices can be utterly smashed by the shorts.With larger companies there are independent investor activists who make a career of acquiring minority stakes in badly managed companies and then leading the common shareholders in an organized campaign against management. Even if the activists cannot secure enough votes to actually replace directors or force the issues outright, management can often be pressured into concessions by the prospect of a knock down drag out fight in public with these famous activists. Carl Ichan [wikipedia.org] is prominent amongst these types of activist investors.Finally, the major institutional investors, including hedge funds, wealth management firms and pension funds keep dossiers on corporate directors and actively vote against those whom they don't like or in whom they have low confidence. Eventually these bad directors get a bad reputation and their careers as corporate directors are effectively ended.

Good post. Which is why when you government trying to regulate naked shorting you know that is regulation being bought and paid for by the folks at the top to help keep them there. Shorts are good thing. The real tragedy is that when our banks were nearly shorted into the ground a few years back now; we let the pols interfere.

140Mandak262Jamuna (970587) | about a year ago | (#43320417)
I work for a S&P mid cap company, heavily into science and engineering. I am not doing bad myself, holding on to a tiny fiefdom in the corporate empire. But my batch mate in my college went into academics, the usual Ph D, post-doc, tenure-track professorship. Did some serious original research, published some good papers and made a name for himself. Surprised to see him appointed as a director to my own company. So it is not all nepotism and dynastic mutual back scratching societies there. This Indian immigrant with absolutely no connections made it to the lofty realms of directorships.
