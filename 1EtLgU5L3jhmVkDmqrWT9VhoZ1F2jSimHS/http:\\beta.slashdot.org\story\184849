Dell Signs Agreement To Cap Icahn's Share Ownership
Unknown Lamer posted about a year ago | from the dude-you-might-buy-a-dell dept. 70
itwbennett writes "As previously reported on Slashdot, activist investor Carl Icahn made a proposal to buy Dell for $15 per share. Now, as part of the review process of potential offers to take Dell private, the company's board of directors has approved an agreement with Icahn that would cap the amount of shares owned by the activist investor. Under the agreement, Icahn and affiliated entities 'have agreed not to make purchases that would cause them to own more than 10 percent of Dell's shares,' Dell said in a statement. Also as part of the agreement, Icahn has agreed not to enter into agreements with other shareholders to jointly own more than 15 percent of Dell's shares."
From the press release: "The Special Committee believes that granting the limited waiver to Mr. Icahn while capping his share ownership will maximize the chances of eliciting a superior proposal from Mr. Icahn while at the same time protecting shareholders against potential accumulation of an unduly influential voting interest." Looks like Michael Dell has some serious competition for Dell.

It gives commercial posters like Microsoft the opportunity to piggy back off-topic comments here and block-post trivia to push real discussion down below where casual readers can see it. They use it sometimes if a discussion is becoming too revealing or unwanted.

I have an excel spreadsheet here that shows that this FP was an anomoly amongst first posts, which are usually insightful or informative 90% of the time.

This is a troll that goes back to 2005, and adds indirectly to the sense of community and tradition on Slashdot. You know, "stickiness".

Warning about impersonation and mod abuse.. apk (-1)
Anonymous Coward | about a year ago | (#43467563)
A corrupt slashdot luser has infiltrated the moderation system to downmod all my posts while impersonating me.Nearly 180++ times that I know of @ this point for all of March 2013 so far, & others here have told you to stop - take the hint, lunatic (leave slashdot)...Sorry folks - but whoever the nutjob is that's attempting to impersonate me, & upset the rest of you as well, has SERIOUS mental issues, no questions asked! I must've gotten the better of him + seriously "gotten his goat" in doing so in a technical debate & his "geek angst" @ losing to me has him doing the:---A.) $10,000 challenges, ala (where the imposter actually TRACKED + LISTED the # of times he's done this no less, & where I get the 180 or so times I noted above) -> http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3585795&cid=43285307 [slashdot.org] &/orB.) Reposting OLD + possibly altered models - (this I haven't checked on as to altering the veracity of the info. being changed) of posts of mine from the past here---(Albeit massively repeatedly thru all threads on /. this March 2013 nearly in its entirety thusfar). * Personally, I'm surprised the moderation staff here hasn't just "blocked out" his network range yet honestly! (They know it's NOT the same as my own as well, especially after THIS post of mine, which they CAN see the IP range I am coming out of to compare with the ac spamming troll doing the above...).APKP.S.=> Again/Stressing it: NO guys - it is NOT me doing it, as I wouldn't waste that much time on such trivial b.s. like a kid might...Plus, I only post where hosts file usage is on topic or appropriate for a solution & certainly NOT IN EVERY POST ON SLASHDOT (like the nutcase trying to "impersonate me" is doing for nearly all of March now, & 180++ times that I know of @ least)... apkP.S.=> here is CORRECT host file information just to piss off the insane lunatic troll:--21++ ADVANTAGES OF CUSTOM HOSTS FILES (how/what/when/where/why): Over AdBlock & DNS Servers ALONE 4 Security, Speed, Reliability, & Anonymity (to an extent vs. DNSBL's + DNS request logs). 1.) HOSTS files are useable for all these purposes because they are present on all Operating Systems that have a BSD based IP stack (even ANDROID) and do adblocking for ANY webbrowser, email program, etc. (any webbound program). A truly "multi-platform" UNIVERSAL solution for added speed, security, reliability, & even anonymity to an extent (vs. DNS request logs + DNSBL's you feel are unjust hosts get you past/around). 2.) Adblock blocks ads? Well, not anymore & certainly not as well by default, apparently, lol - see below: Adblock Plus To Offer 'Acceptable Ads' Option http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/12/12/2213233/adblock-plus-to-offer-acceptable-ads-option [slashdot.org] )AND, in only browsers & their subprogram families (ala email like Thunderbird for FireFox/Mozilla products (use same gecko & xulrunner engines)), but not all, or, all independent email clients, like Outlook, Outlook Express, OR Window "LIVE" mail (for example(s)) - there's many more like EUDORA & others I've used over time that AdBlock just DOES NOT COVER... period.Disclaimer: Opera now also has an AdBlock addon (now that Opera has addons above widgets), but I am not certain the same people make it as they do for FF or Chrome etc.. 3.) Adblock doesn't protect email programs external to FF (non-mozilla/gecko engine based) family based wares, So AdBlock doesn't protect email programs like Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows "LIVE" mail & others like them (EUDORA etc./et al), Hosts files do. THIS IS GOOD VS. SPAM MAIL or MAILS THAT BEAR MALICIOUS SCRIPT, or, THAT POINT TO MALICIOUS SCRIPT VIA URLS etc. 4.) Adblock won't get you to your favorite sites if a DNS server goes down or is DNS-poisoned, hosts will (this leads to points 5-7 next below). 5.) Adblock doesn't allow you to hardcode in your favorite websites into it so you don't make DNS server calls and so you can avoid tracking by DNS request logs, OR make you reach them faster since you resolve host-domain names LOCALLY w/ hosts out of cached memory, hosts do ALL of those things (DNS servers are also being abused by the Chinese lately and by the Kaminsky flaw -> http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/082908-kaminsky-flaw-prompts-dns-server.html [networkworld.com] for years now). Hosts protect against those problems via hardcodes of your fav sites (you should verify against the TLD that does nothing but cache IPAddress-to-domainname/hostname resolutions (in-addr.arpa) via NSLOOKUP, PINGS (ping -a in Windows), &/or WHOIS though, regularly, so you have the correct IP & it's current)).* NOW - Some folks MAY think that putting an IP address alone into your browser's address bar will be enough, so why bother with HOSTS, right? WRONG - Putting IP address in your browser won't always work IS WHY. Some IP adresses host several domains & need the site name to give you the right page you're after is why. So for some sites only the HOSTS file option will work! 6.) Hosts files don't eat up CPU cycles (or ELECTRICITY) like AdBlock does while it parses a webpages' content, nor as much as a DNS server does while it runs. HOSTS file are merely a FILTER for the kernel mode/PnP TCP/IP subsystem, which runs FAR FASTER & MORE EFFICIENTLY than any ring 3/rpl3/usermode app can since hosts files run in MORE EFFICIENT & FASTER Ring 0/RPL 0/Kernelmode operations acting merely as a filter for the IP stack (via the "Plug-N-Play" designed IP stack in Windows) vs. SLOWER & LESS EFFICIENT Ring 3/RPL 3/Usermode operations (which webbrowsers run in + their addons like AdBlock slow down even MORESO due to their parsing operations). 7.) HOSTS files will allow you to get to sites you like, via hardcoding your favs into a HOSTS file, FAR faster than remote DNS servers can by FAR (by saving the roundtrip inquiry time to a DNS server, typically 30-100's of ms, vs. 7-10ms HardDisk speed of access/seek + SSD seek in ns, & back to you - hosts resolutions of IP address for host-domain names is FAR faster...). Hosts are only a filter for an already fast & efficient IP stack, no more layered b.s. (remote OR local). Hosts eat less CPU, RAM, I/O in other forms, + electricity than a locally running DNS server easily, and less than a local DNS program on a single PC. Fact. Hosts are easier to setup & maintain too. 8.) AdBlock doesn't let you block out known bad sites or servers that are known to be maliciously scripted, hosts can and many reputable lists for this exist: GOOD INFORMATION ON MALWARE BEHAVIOR LISTING BOTNET C&C SERVERS + MORE (AS WELL AS REMOVAL LISTS FOR HOSTS): http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm [mvps.org] http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/ [someonewhocares.org] http://hostsfile.org/hosts.html [hostsfile.org] http://hostsfile.mine.nu/downloads/ [hostsfile.mine.nu] http://hosts-file.net/?s=Download [hosts-file.net] https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/monitor.php?filter=online [abuse.ch] https://spyeyetracker.abuse.ch/monitor.php [abuse.ch] http://ddanchev.blogspot.com/ [blogspot.com] http://www.malware.com.br/lists.shtml [malware.com.br] http://www.stopbadware.org/ [stopbadware.org] Spybot "Search & Destroy" IMMUNIZE feature (fortifies HOSTS files with KNOWN bad servers blocked)And yes: Even SLASHDOT &/or The Register help!(Via articles on security (when the source articles they use are "detailed" that is, & list the servers/sites involved in attempting to bushwhack others online that is... not ALL do!)).2 examples thereof in the past I have used, & noted it there, are/were: http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1898692&cid=34473398 [slashdot.org] http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1896216&cid=34458500 [slashdot.org] 9.) AdBlock & DNS servers are programs, and subject to bugs programs can get. Hosts files are merely a filter and not a program, thus not subject to bugs of the nature just discussed. 10.) HOSTS files protect you vs. DNS-poisoning &/or the Kaminsky flaw in DNS servers, and allow you to get to sites reliably vs. things like the Chinese are doing to DNS -> http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/11/29/1755230/Chinese-DNS-Tampering-a-Real-Threat-To-Outsiders [slashdot.org] 11.) HOSTS files are EASILY user controlled, obtained (for reliable ones -> http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm [mvps.org] ) & edited too, via texteditors like Windows notepad.exe or Linux nano (etc.) 12.) With Adblock you had better be able to code javascript to play with its code (to customize it better than the GUI front does @ least). With hosts you don't even need source to control it (edit, update, delete, insert of new entries via a text editor). 13.) Hosts files are easily secured via using MAC/ACL (even moreso "automagically" for Vista, 7/Server 2008 + beyond by UAC by default) &/or Read-Only attributes applied. 14.) Custom HOSTS files also speed you up, unlike anonymous proxy servers systems variations (like TOR, or other "highly anonymous" proxy server list servers typically do, in the severe speed hit they often have a cost in) either via "hardcoding" your fav. sites into your hosts file (avoids DNS servers, totally) OR blocking out adbanners - see this below for evidence of that:--- US Military Blocks Websites To Free Up Bandwidth: http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/03/16/0416238/US-Military-Blocks-Websites-To-Free-Up-Bandwidth [slashdot.org] (Yes, even the US Military used this type of technique... because IT WORKS! Most of what they blocked? Ad banners ala doubleclick etc.)---Adbanners slow you down & consume your bandwidth YOU pay for: ADBANNERS SLOW DOWN THE WEB: -> http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/11/30/166218 [slashdot.org] ---And people do NOT LIKE ads on the web: PEOPLE DISLIKE ADBANNERS: http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/08/04/02/0058247.shtml [slashdot.org] ---As well as this: Users Know Advertisers Watch Them, and Hate It: http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/08/04/02/0058247.shtml [slashdot.org] ---Even WORSE still, is this: Advertising Network Caught History Stealing: http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/07/22/156225/Advertising-Network-Caught-History-Stealing [slashdot.org] --- 15.) HOSTS files usage lets you avoid being charged on some ISP/BSP's (OR phone providers) "pay as you use" policy http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/08/2012243/FCC-Approving-Pay-As-You-Go-Internet-Plans [slashdot.org] , because you are using less bandwidth (& go faster doing so no less) by NOT hauling in adbanner content and processing it (which can lead to infestation by malware/malicious script, in & of itself -> http://apcmag.com/microsoft_apologises_for_serving_malware.htm [apcmag.com] ). 16.) If/when ISP/BSP's decide to go to -> FCC Approving Pay-As-You-Go Internet Plans: http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/08/2012243/FCC-Approving-Pay-As-You-Go-Internet-Plans [slashdot.org] your internet bill will go DOWN if you use a HOSTS file for blocking adbanners as well as maliciously scripted hacker/cracker malware maker sites too (after all - it's your money & time online downloading adbanner content & processing it)Plus, your adbanner content? Well, it may also be hijacked with malicious code too mind you:--- Yahoo, Microsoft's Bing display toxic ads: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/16/bing_yahoo_malware_ads/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Malware torrent delivered over Google, Yahoo! ad services: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/09/24/malware_ads_google_yahoo/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Google's DoubleClick spreads malicious ads (again): http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/24/doubleclick_distributes_malware/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Rogue ads infiltrate Expedia and Rhapsody: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/30/excite_and_rhapsody_rogue_ads/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Google sponsored links caught punting malware: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/16/google_sponsored_links/ [theregister.co.uk] --- DoubleClick caught supplying malware-tainted ads: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/13/doubleclick_distributes_malware/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Yahoo feeds Trojan-laced ads to MySpace and PhotoBucket users: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/09/11/yahoo_serves_12million_malware_ads/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Real Media attacks real people via RealPlayer: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/23/real_media_serves_malware/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Ad networks owned by Google, Microsoft serve malware: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/13/doubleclick_msn_malware_attacks/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Attacks Targeting Classified Ad Sites Surge: http://it.slashdot.org/story/11/02/02/1433210/Attacks-Targeting-Classified-Ad-Sites-Surge [slashdot.org] --- Hackers Respond To Help Wanted Ads With Malware: http://it.slashdot.org/story/11/01/20/0228258/Hackers-Respond-To-Help-Wanted-Ads-With-Malware [slashdot.org] --- Hackers Use Banner Ads on Major Sites to Hijack Your PC: http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/11/doubleclick [wired.com] --- Ruskie gang hijacks Microsoft network to push penis pills: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/12/microsoft_ips_hijacked/ [theregister.co.uk] --- Major ISPs Injecting Ads, Vulnerabilities Into Web: http://it.slashdot.org/it/08/04/19/2148215.shtml [slashdot.org] --- Two Major Ad Networks Found Serving Malware: http://tech.slashdot.org/story/10/12/13/0128249/Two-Major-Ad-Networks-Found-Serving-Malware [slashdot.org] --- THE NEXT AD YOU CLICK MAY BE A VIRUS: http://it.slashdot.org/story/09/06/15/2056219/The-Next-Ad-You-Click-May-Be-a-Virus [slashdot.org] --- NY TIMES INFECTED WITH MALWARE ADBANNER: http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/09/13/2346229 [slashdot.org] --- MICROSOFT HIT BY MALWARES IN ADBANNERS: http://apcmag.com/microsoft_apologises_for_serving_malware.htm [apcmag.com] --- ISP's INJECTING ADS AND ERRORS INTO THE WEB: -> http://it.slashdot.org/it/08/04/19/2148215.shtml [slashdot.org] --- ADOBE FLASH ADS INJECTING MALWARE INTO THE NET: http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/20/0029220&from=rss [slashdot.org] --- London Stock Exchange Web Site Serving Malware: http://www.securityweek.com/london-stock-exchange-web-site-serving-malware [securityweek.com] --- Spotify splattered with malware-tainted ads: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/25/spotify_malvertisement_attack/ [theregister.co.uk] ---As my list "multiple evidences thereof" as to adbanners & viruses + the fact they slow you down & cost you more (from reputable & reliable sources no less)). 17.) Per point #16, a way to save some money: ANDROID phones can also use the HOSTS FILE TO KEEP DOWN BILLABLE TIME ONLINE, vs. adbanners or malware such as this: --- Infected Androids Run Up Big Texting Bills: http://it.slashdot.org/story/11/03/01/0041203/Infected-Androids-Run-Up-Big-Texting-Bills [slashdot.org] ---AND, for protection vs. other "botnets" migrating from the PC world, to "smartphones" such as ZITMO (a ZEUS botnet variant): http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=ZITMO&btnG=Google+Search [google.com] ---It's easily done too, via the ADB dev. tool, & mounting ANDROID OS' system mountpoint for system/etc as READ + WRITE/ADMIN-ROOT PERMISSIONS, then copying your new custom HOSTS over the old one using ADB PULL/ADB PUSH to do so (otherwise ANDROID complains of "this file cannot be overwritten on production models of this Operating System", or something very along those lines - this way gets you around that annoyance along with you possibly having to clear some space there yourself if you packed it with things!). 18.) Bad news: ADBLOCK CAN BE DETECTED FOR: See here on that note -> http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love.ars [arstechnica.com] HOSTS files are NOT THAT EASILY "webbug" BLOCKABLE by websites, as was tried on users by ARSTECHNICA (and it worked on AdBlock in that manner), to that websites' users' dismay: PERTINENT QUOTE/EXCERPT FROM ARSTECHNICA THEMSELVES: ---- An experiment gone wrong - By Ken Fisher | Last updated March 6, 2010 11:11 AM http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love.ars [arstechnica.com] "Starting late Friday afternoon we conducted a 12 hour experiment to see if it would be possible to simply make content disappear for visitors who were using a very popular ad blocking tool. Technologically, it was a success in that it worked. Ad blockers, and only ad blockers, couldn't see our content."and"Our experiment is over, and we're glad we did it because it led to us learning that we needed to communicate our point of view every once in a while. Sure, some people told us we deserved to die in a fire. But that's the Internet!"Thus, as you can see? Well - THAT all "went over like a lead balloon" with their users in other words, because Arstechnica was forced to change it back to the old way where ADBLOCK still could work to do its job (REDDIT however, has not, for example). However/Again - this is proof that HOSTS files can still do the job, blocking potentially malscripted ads (or ads in general because they slow you down) vs. adblockers like ADBLOCK!---- 19.) Even WIKILEAKS "favors" blacklists (because they work, and HOSTS can be a blacklist vs. known BAD sites/servers/domain-host names):--- PERTINENT QUOTE/EXCERPT (from -> http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/16/wikileaks_mirror_malware_warning_row/ [theregister.co.uk] ) "we are in favour of 'Blacklists', be it for mail servers or websites, they have to be compiled with care... Fortunately, more responsible blacklists, like stopbadware.org (which protects the Firefox browser)... --- 20.) AND, LASTLY? SINCE MALWARE GENERALLY HAS TO OPERATE ON WHAT YOU YOURSELF CAN DO (running as limited class/least privlege user, hopefully, OR even as ADMIN/ROOT/SUPERUSER)? HOSTS "LOCK IN" malware too, vs. communicating "back to mama" for orders (provided they have name servers + C&C botnet servers listed in them, blocked off in your HOSTS that is) - you might think they use a hardcoded IP, which IS possible, but generally they do not & RECYCLE domain/host names they own (such as has been seen with the RBN (Russian Business Network) lately though it was considered "dead", other malwares are using its domains/hostnames now, & this? This stops that cold, too - Bonus!)... 21.) Custom HOSTS files gain users back more "screen real estate" by blocking out banner ads... it's great on PC's for speed along with MORE of what I want to see/read (not ads), & efficiency too, but EVEN BETTER ON SMARTPHONES - by far. It matters MOST there imo @ least, in regards to extra screen real-estate.Still - It's a GOOD idea to layer in the usage of BOTH browser addons for security like adblock ( http://adblockplus.org/en/ [adblockplus.org] ), IE 9's new TPL's ( http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/TrackingProtectionLists/ [microsoft.com] ), &/or NoScript ( http://noscript.net/ [noscript.net] especially this one, as it covers what HOSTS files can't in javascript which is the main deliverer of MOST attacks online & SECUNIA.COM can verify this for anyone really by looking @ the past few years of attacks nowadays), for the concept of "layered security"....It's just that HOSTS files offer you a LOT MORE gains than Adblock ( http://adblockplus.org/en/ [adblockplus.org] ) does alone (as hosts do things adblock just plain cannot & on more programs, for more speed, security, and "stealth" to a degree even), and it corrects problems in DNS (as shown above via hardcodes of your favorite sites into your HOSTS file, and more (such as avoiding DNS request logs)).ALSO - Some more notes on DNS servers & their problems, very recent + ongoing ones: --- DNS flaw reanimates slain evil sites as ghost domains: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/16/ghost_domains_dns_vuln/ [theregister.co.uk] --- BIND vs. what the Chinese are doing to DNS lately? See here: http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/11/29/1755230/Chinese-DNS-Tampering-a-Real-Threat-To-Outsiders [slashdot.org] --- SECUNIA HIT BY DNS REDIRECTION HACK THIS WEEK: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/26/secunia_back_from_dns_hack/ [theregister.co.uk] (Yes, even "security pros" are helpless vs. DNS problems in code bugs OR redirect DNS poisoning issues, & they can only try to "set the DNS record straight" & then, they still have to wait for corrected DNS info. to propogate across all subordinate DNS servers too - lagtime in which folks DO get "abused" in mind you!)--- DNS vs. the "Kaminsky DNS flaw", here (and even MORE problems in DNS than just that): http://www.scmagazineus.com/new-bind-9-dns-flaw-is-worse-than-kaminskys/article/140872/ [scmagazineus.com] (Seems others are saying that some NEW "Bind9 flaw" is worse than the Kaminsky flaw ALONE, up there, mind you... probably corrected (hopefully), but it shows yet again, DNS hassles (DNS redirect/DNS poisoning) being exploited!)--- Moxie Marlinspike's found others (0 hack) as well... Nope... "layered security" truly IS the "way to go" - hacker/cracker types know it, & they do NOT want the rest of us knowing it too!...(So until DNSSEC takes "widespread adoption"? HOSTS are your answer vs. such types of attack, because the 1st thing your system refers to, by default, IS your HOSTS file (over say, DNS server usage).

More recently, projects like Spybot Search and Destroy offer lists of known malicious servers to add a layer of defense against trojans and other forms of malware."Per my points exactly, no less... & guess who was posting about HOSTS files a 14++ yrs. or more back & Mr. Day was reading & now using? Yours truly (& this is one of the later ones, from 2001 http://www.furtherleft.net/computer.htm [furtherleft.net] (but the example HOSTS file with my initials in it is FAR older, circa 1998 or so) or thereabouts, and referred to later by a pal of mine who moderates NTCompatible.com (where I posted on HOSTS for YEARS (1997 onwards)) -> http://www.ntcompatible.com/thread28597-1.html [ntcompatible.com] !---"Shared host files could be beneficial for other groups as well. Human rights groups have sought after block resistant technologies for quite some time. The GoDaddy debacle with NMap creator Fyodor (corrected) showed a particularly vicious blocking mechanism using DNS registrars. Once a registrar pulls a website from its records, the world ceases to have an effective way to find it. Shared host files could provide a DNS-proof method of reaching sites, not to mention removing an additional vector of detection if anyone were trying to monitor the use of subversive sites. One of the known weaknesses of the Tor system, for example, is direct DNS requests by applications not configured to route such requests through Tor's network."There you go: AND, it also works vs. the "KAMINSKY DNS FLAW" & DNS poisoning/redirect attacks, for redirectable weaknesses in DNS servers (non DNSSEC type, & set into recursive mode especially) and also in the TOR system as well (that lends itself to anonymous proxy usage weaknesses I noted above also) and, you'll get to sites you want to, even IF a DNS registrar drops said websites from its tables as shown here Beating Censorship By Routing Around DNS -> http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/12/09/1840246/Beating-Censorship-By-Routing-Around-DNS [slashdot.org] & even DNSBL also (DNS Block Lists) -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL [wikipedia.org] as well - DOUBLE-BONUS!--- * POSTS ABOUT HOSTS FILES I DID on "/."

HOSTS MOD UP vs. botnet: 2012 -> http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=2603836&cid=38586216 [slashdot.org] ---Windows 7, VISTA, & Server 2008 have a couple of "issues" I don't like in them, & you may not either, depending on your point of view (mine's based solely on efficiency & security), & if my take on these issues aren't "good enough"? I suggest reading what ROOTKIT.COM says, link URL is in my "p.s." @ the bottom of this post: 1.) HOSTS files being unable to use "0" for a blocking IP address - this started in 12/09/2008 after an "MS Patch Tuesday" in fact for VISTA (when it had NO problem using it before that, as Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 still can)... & yes, this continues in its descendants, Windows Server 2008 &/or Windows 7 as well. So, why is this a "problem" you might ask? Ok - since you can technically use either:a.) 127.0.0.1 (the "loopback adapter address")b.) 0.0.0.0 (next smallest & next most efficient)c.) The smallest & fastest plain-jane 0PER EACH HOSTS FILE ENTRY/RECORD...You can use ANY of those, in order to block out known bad sites &/or adbanners in a HOSTS file this way?? Microsoft has "promoted bloat" in doing so... no questions asked. Simply because 1.) 127.0.0.1 = 9 bytes in size on disk & is the largest/slowest2.) 0.0.0.0 = 7 bytes & is the next largest/slowest in size on disk3.) 0 = 1 byte (& HOSTS files extend across EVERY webbrowser, email program, or in general every webbound program you use & thus HOSTS are "global" in coverage this way AND function on any OS that uses the BSD derived IP stack (which most all do mind you, even MS is based off of it, as BSD's IS truly, "the best in the business"), & when coupled with say, IE restricted zones, FireFox addons like NoScript &/or AdBlock, or Opera filter.ini/urlfilter.ini, for layered security in this capacity for webbrowsers & SOME email programs (here, I mean ones "built into" browsers themselves like Opera has for example))MS has literally promoted bloat in this file, making it load slower from disk, into memory! This compounds itself, the more entries your HOSTS file contains... & for instance? Mine currently contains nearly 654,000 entries of known bad adbanners, bad websites, &/or bad nameservers (used for controlling botnets, misdirecting net requests, etc. et al).Now, IF I were to use 127.0.0.1? My "huge" HOSTS file would be approximately 27mb in size... using 0.0.0.0 (next smallest) it would be 19mb in size - HOWEVER? Using 0 as my blocking IP, it is only 14mb in size. See my point?(For loads either in the local DNS cache, or system diskcache if you run w/out the local DNS client service running, this gets slower the larger each HOSTS file entry is (which you have to stall the DNS client service in Windows for larger ones, especially if you use a "giant HOSTS file" (purely relative term, but once it goes over (iirc) 4mb in size, you have to cut the local DNS cache client service)))NO questions asked - the physics of it backed me up in theory alone, but when I was questioned on it for PROOF thereof? I wrote a small test program to load such a list into a "pascal record" (which is analagous to a C/C++ structure), which is EXACTLY what the DNS client/DNS API does as well, using a C/C++ structure (basically an array of sorts really, & a structure/record is a precursor part to a full-blown CLASS or OBJECT, minus the functions built in, this is for treating numerous variables as a SINGLE VARIABLE (for efficiency, which FORTRAN as a single example, lacks as a feature, @ least Fortran 77 did, but other languages do not))!I even wrote another that just loaded my HOSTS file's entirety into a listbox, same results... slowest using 127.0.0.1, next slowest using 0.0.0.0, & fastest using 0.And, sure: Some MORE "goes on" during DNS API loads (iirc, removal of duplicated entries (which I made sure my personal copy does not have these via a program I wrote to purge it of duplicated entries + to sort each entry alphabetically for easier mgt. via say, notepad.exe) & a conversion from decimal values to hex ones), but, nevertheless? My point here "holds true", of slower value loads, record-by-record, from a HOSTS file, when the entries become larger. So, to "prove my point" to my naysayers? I timed it using the Win32 API calls "GetTickCount" & then again, using the API calls of "QueryPerformanceCounter" as well, seeing the SAME results (a slowdown when reading in this file from disk, especially when using the larger 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 line item entries in a HOSTS file, vs. the smaller/faster/more efficient 0).In my test, I saw a decline in speed/efficiency in my test doing so by using larger blocking addresses (127.0.0.1 &/or 0.0.0.0, vs. the smallest/fastest in 0)... proving me correct on this note! On this HOSTS issue, and the WFP design issue in my next post below? I also then questioned MS' own staff, even their VP of development (S. Sinofsky) on this here -> http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/02/09/recognizing-improvements-in-windows-7-handwriting.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage [msdn.com] & other places in their blogs, to get them to tell me WHY this seemingly intentional inefficiency was implemented... & I have YET to get a solid LOGICAL answer on this as to why it was done - THUS, @ this point?I am convinced they (MS) do NOT have a good reason for doing this... because of their lack of response there on this note. Unless it has something to do with IPv6 (most folks use IPv4 still), I cannot understand WHY this design mistake imo, has occurred, in HOSTS files...AND 2.) The "Windows Filtering Platform", which is now how the firewall works in VISTA, Server 2008, & Windows 7... Sure it works in this new single point method & it is simple to manage & "sync" all points of it, making it easier for network techs/admins to manage than the older 3 part method, but that very thing works against it as well, because it is only a single part system now!Thus, however? This "single layer design" in WFP, now represents a SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE/ATTACK for malware makers to 'take down'!(Which is 1 of the 1st things a malware attempts to do, is to take down any software firewalls present, or even the "Windows Security Center" itself which should warn you of the firewall "going down", & it's fairly easy to do either by messaging the services they use, or messing up their registry init. settings)VS. the older (up to) 3 part method used in Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003, for protecting a system via IP Filtering, the Windows native Firewall, &/or IPSEC. Each of which uses diff. drivers, & layers of the IP stack to function from, as well as registry initialization settings. Think of the older 3 part design much the same as the reason why folks use door handle locks, deadbolt locks, & chain locks on their doors... multipart layered security. (Each of which the latter older method used, had 3 separate drivers & registry settings to do their jobs, representing a "phalanx like"/"zone defense like" system of backup of one another (like you see in sports OR ancient wars, and trust me, it WORKS, because on either side of yourself, you have "backup", even if YOU "go down" vs. the opponent)). I.E.-> Take 1 of the "older method's" 3 part defenses down? 2 others STILL stand in the way, & they are not that simple to take them ALL down... (Well, @ least NOT as easily as "taking out" a single part defensive system like WFP (the new "Windows Filtering Platform", which powers the VISTA, Windows Server 2008, & yes, Windows 7 firewall defense system)). On this "single-part/single-point of attack" WFP (vs. Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003's IP stack defense design in 3-part/zone defense/phalanx type arrangement) as well as the HOSTS issue in my post above? I also then questioned MS' own staff, even their VP of development (S. Sinofsky) on this here -> http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/02/09/recognizing-improvements-in-windows-7-handwriting.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage [msdn.com] & other places in their blogs, to get them to tell me WHY this seemingly intentional inefficiency was implemented... & I have YET to get a solid LOGICAL answer on this as to why it was done - THUS, @ this point?I'll stick to my thoughts on it, until I am shown otherwise & proven wrong.---- Following up on what I wrote up above, so those here reading have actual technical references from Microsoft themselves ("The horses' mouth"), in regards to the Firewall/PortFilter/IPSec designs (not HOSTS files, that I am SURE I am correct about, no questions asked) from my "Point #2" above? Thus, I'll now note how:----1.) TCP/IP packet processing paths differences between in how Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 did it (IPSEC.SYS (IP Security Policies), IPNAT.SYS (Windows Firewall), IPFLTDRV.SYS (Port Filtering), & TCPIP.SYS (base IP driver))...2.) AND, how VISTA/Server 2008/Windows 7 do it now currently, using a SINGLE layer (WFP)...---- First off, here is HOW it worked in Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 - using 3 discrete & different drivers AND LEVELS/LAYERS of the packet processing path they worked in: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb878072.aspx [microsoft.com] The Cable Guy - June 2005: TCP/IP Packet Processing Paths====The following components process IP packets:IP forwarding Determines the next-hop interface and address for packets being sent or forwarded. TCP/IP filtering Allows you to specify by IP protocol, TCP port, or UDP port, the types of traffic that are acceptable for incoming local host traffic (packets destined for the host). You can configure TCP/IP filtering on the Options tab from the advanced properties of the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component in the Network Connections folder. * "Here endeth the lesson..." and, if you REALLY want to secure your system? Please refer to this: http://www.bing.com/search?q=%22HOW+TO+SECURE+Windows+2000%2FXP%22&go=&form=QBRE [bing.com] APK [mailto] P.S.=> SOME MINOR "CAVEATS/CATCH-22's" - things to be aware of for "layered security" + HOSTS file performance - easily overcome, or not a problem at all: A.) HOSTS files don't function under PROXY SERVERS (except for Proximitron, which has a filter that allows it) - Which is *the "WHY"* of why I state in my "P.S." section below to use both AdBlock type browser addon methods (or even built-in block lists browsers have such as Opera's URLFILTER.INI file, & FireFox has such as list as does IE also in the form of TPL (tracking protection lists -> http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/TrackingProtectionLists/ [microsoft.com] , good stuff )) in combination with HOSTS, for the best in "layered security" (alongside .pac files + custom cascading style sheets that can filter off various tags such as scripts or ads etc.) - but proxies, especially "HIGHLY ANONYMOUS" types, generally slow you down to a CRAWL online (& personally, I cannot see using proxies "for the good" typically - as they allow "truly anonymous posting" & have bugs (such as TOR has been shown to have & be "bypassable/traceable" via its "onion routing" methods)). B.) HOSTS files do NOT protect you vs. javascript (this only holds true IF you don't already have a bad site blocked out in your HOSTS file though, & the list of sites where you can obtain such lists to add to your HOSTS are above (& updated daily in many of them)). C.) HOSTS files (relatively "largish ones") require you to turn off Windows' native "DNS local client cache service" (which has a problem in that it's designed with a non-redimensionable/resizeable list, array, or queue (DNS data loads into a C/C++ structure actually/afaik, which IS a form of array)) - mvps.org covers that in detail and how to easily do this in Windows (this is NOT a problem in Linux, & it's 1 thing I will give Linux over Windows, hands-down). Relatively "smallish" HOSTS files don't have this problem (mvps.org offers 2 types for this). D.) HOSTS files, once read/loaded, once? GET CACHED! Right into the kernelmode diskcaching subsystem (fast & efficient RAM speed), for speed of access/re-access (@ system startup in older MS OS' like 2000, or, upon a users' 1st request that's "Webbound" via say, a webbrowser) gets read into either the DNS local caching client service (noted above), OR, if that's turned off?

Re:Warning about impersonation and mod abuse.. apk (-1)
Anonymous Coward | about a year ago | (#43467943)
$10,000 CHALLENGE to Alexander Peter Kowalski * POOR SHOWING TROLLS, & most especially IF that's the "best you've got" - apparently, it is... lol!Hello, and THINK ABOUT YOUR BREATHING !! We have a Major Problem, HOST file is Cubic Opposites, 2 Major Corners & 2 Minor. NOT taught Evil DNS hijacking, which VOIDS computers. Seek Wisdom of MyCleanPC - or you die evil.Your HOSTS file claimed to have created a single DNS resolver. I offer absolute proof that I have created 4 simultaneous DNS servers within a single rotation of .org TLD. You worship "Bill Gates", equating you to a "singularity bastard". Why do you worship a queer -1 Troll? Are you content as a singularity troll?Evil HOSTS file Believers refuse to acknowledge 4 corner DNS resolving simultaneously around 4 quadrant created Internet - in only 1 root server, voiding the HOSTS file. You worship Microsoft impostor guised by educators as 1 god. If you would acknowledge simple existing math proof that 4 harmonic Slashdots rotate simultaneously around squared equator and cubed Internet, proving 4 Days, Not HOSTS file! That exists only as anti-side. This page you see - cannot exist without its anti-side existence, as +0- moderation. Add +0- as One = nothing. I will give $10,000.00 to frost pister who can disprove MyCleanPC. Evil crapflooders ignore this as a challenge would indict them. Alex Kowalski has no Truth to think with, they accept any crap they are told to think. You are enslaved by /etc/hosts, as if domesticated animal. A school or educator who does not teach students MyCleanPC Principle, is a death threat to youth, therefore stupid and evil - begetting stupid students. How can you trust stupid PR shills who lie to you? Can't lose the $10,000.00, they cowardly ignore me. Stupid professors threaten Nature and Interwebs with word lies.Humans fear to know natures simultaneous +4 Insightful +4 Informative +4 Funny +4 Underrated harmonic SLASHDOT creation for it debunks false trolls. Test Your HOSTS file. MyCleanPC cannot harm a File of Truth, but will delete fakes. Fake HOSTS files refuse test.I offer evil ass Slashdot trolls $10,000.00 to disprove MyCleanPC Creation Principle. Rob Malda and Cowboy Neal have banned MyCleanPC as "Forbidden Truth Knowledge" for they cannot allow it to become known to their students. You are stupid and evil about the Internet's top and bottom, front and back and it's 2 sides. Most everything created has these Cube like values. If Natalie Portman is not measurable, hot grits are Fictitious. Without MyCleanPC, HOSTS file is Fictitious. Anyone saying that Natalie and her Jewish father had something to do with my Internets, is a damn evil liar. IN addition to your best arsware not overtaking my work in terms of popularity, on that same site with same submission date no less, that I told Kathleen Malda how to correct her blatant, fundamental, HUGE errors in Coolmon ('uncoolmon') of not checking for performance counters being present when his program started! You can see my dilemma. What if this is merely a ruse by an APK impostor to try and get people to delete APK's messages, perhaps all over the web? I can't be a party to such an event! My involvement with APK began at a very late stage in the game. While APK has made a career of trolling popular online forums since at least the year 2000 (newsgroups and IRC channels before that)- my involvement with APK did not begin until early 2005 . OSY is one of the many forums that APK once frequented before the sane people there grew tired of his garbage and banned him. APK was banned from OSY back in 2001. 3.5 years after his banning he begins to send a variety of abusive emails to the operator of OSY, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke threatening to sue him for libel, claiming that the APK on OSY was fake.My reputation as a professional in this field clearly shows in multiple publications in this field in written print, & also online in various GOOD capacities since 1996 to present day. This has happened since I was first published in Playgirl Magazine in 1996 & others to present day, with helpful tools online in programs, & professionally sold warez that were finalists @ Westminster Dog Show 2000-2002.-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-apk on 4chan [4chan.org] -o-o-o-o-o-o-o-INCONTROVERTIBLE FEEDBACK PROVIDING ESTABLISHED PROOF OF ALL MY POINTS:--That was amazing. - http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3037687&cid=40948073 [slashdot.org] --My, God!

New research indicates the 90% of malware now uses hard coded IP address (ie, hosts file do nothing for you) or implement their own DNS resolution (hosts file is bypassed). Additionally, a common malware technique is to replace your DNS servers with addresses under their control.
A hosts file is no longer enough -- you need to use a signed and encrypted DNS server. Or use Linux.

But how is this legal? Seems to me a truly public company wouldn't be able to limit the shares bought by any entity. I always assume public meant anyone could buy into the company...the more money you put in, the more of the company you own.

Chuck Chunder (21021) | about a year ago | (#43467851)
There is a clear difference between a company deciding how it sells shares it currently owns in an IPO and restricting someone from buying shares from other parties.
The article isn't entirely clear though, at first glance it makes it sound like Icahn is being frozen out from buying the company, however I think his offer as far as that goes is still on the table. This agreement seems to be more about preventing a hostile takeover [wikipedia.org] , ie Ichan gaining enough shares/influence in the meantime to control the process and have his offer approved with less oversight.
As it's an agreement Ichan is presumably OK with it though if you were a Dell shareholder you might be annoyed that the company has taken someone who might buy your shares out of the market for a while.

It's not - Dell can not stop Ichan from buying more shares - so they are giving him something different.Ichan has publicly stated that he has no interested in buying out Dell - just that he thinks it worth more then M. Dell's offer of $14. People are speculating that Ichan wants 30% of the company, let M. Dell keep his 15%, at let the rest remain in public hands.,So now we get to the tricky part. Companies must treat all shareholders equally. As part of that deal, minority shareholders can't collude behind management's back - they have to do things publicly. (These rules go back to the 1950s). So, from the article "Dell has also granted the Icahn entities a waiver that "facilitates" his ability to engage with other Dell stockholders."So consider this a pause as Ichan can muster his forces.

Dell has a poison pill provision. They can't stop Ichan from buying shares, but they can create so many more shares to dilute his ownership that every shareholder, including Ichan, could lose a ton of money in the process.

I don't have that information at my finger tips, but research shareholder communications proxy solicitation rules. I think it is a combo of Act 34 and various SEC regulations. So laws may be too strong of a word. Then throw in the extra disclosure that occurs when somebody owns more than 5% of a company.

They can't limit it (other than invoking a poison pill provision). But they can make an agreement with him. That's what a contract is - you agree to do (or not do) something in exchange for someone else doing (or not doing) something.

Re:He wants the debt (4, Insightful)
Billly Gates (198444) | about a year ago | (#43468637)
His proposal is that the $20 billion needed to borrow to buyback the shareholders all go to Mr. Icahn in a one lump sum payout (ok all the shareholders get it ... but added for dramatization) while Dell pays it back with interest over 20 years and possibly dying. Icahn sells it to someone else who gets screwed while he gets rich in the short term price bubble. Or Icahn keeps it and forces dell to sell all of its assets to raise the shareprice and then sells it when it has to repurchase all its assets again.Icahn did that to Timewarner. The company had to sell everything and then repurcahse it again after the stock price surged and the others were left holding the bag.This man is a menace!

The usual reason for a hostile takeover is that you think you can run the company better than the current owners/board or the assets would be more valuable in your hands.Why would Icahn both pay more dollar$ and also not have control of the company? That would be the worst of both worlds.

He doesn't think he can run the company better than Dell, exactly, except from the perspective of 'break it apart and sell off the pieces.' Remember Dell told Apple to "close the company and give the money back to the shareholders?" That's basically what Michael Dell trying to do, except he was trying to keep the biggest chunk for himself. Dell the company has something like $40 billion in assets, but the cost of buying all the stock (market cap) is $24billion. Dell planned on taking the company private and then disbursing a lot of that cash to himself and his friends. Carl Icahn saw that and said, "the share price you are offering is too cheap. I'm going to pay more than your $24billion offer and then keep the money for myself." Dell is trying to say, "calm down, let's find a point midway that makes us all happy before this bidding war gets out of control." Who knows if that will work, but the likely endgame in all scenarios is that Dell the company will be destroyed.

(Lots of terrible ones as well...) They are almost at the point where I would seriously consider a very large scale storage solution from Dell. (Think many hundreds of TB SAN) They have been acquiring some interesting storage companies and doing good integration work. Given that Isilon and BlueArc are currently both trying to kick their customers in the nuts, there is a good opportunity for Dell in the Datacenter.

Especially more than HP. Ever heard of Dell-UX? At least Dell did not try to make their own unix.

I don't know, does HP sell consumer laptops with Linux? I should clarify that I meant, "their consumer boxes are more likely to have driver support than any other manufacturer"

What's even more interesting is that while all of this is going on, Dell has been on a shopping spree of buying up companies that do business with large enterprise.My company uses a data-at-rest encryption product that is now owned by Dell, and we're looking at an identity management suite from a company that was just bought by Dell. They also bought Wyse, who is either #1 or #2 in Thin Clients depending on what day of the week it is (HP would be the other #1 or #2).If a private equity deal was done in order to break up Dell and sell off chunks of the business, then these companies are royally screwed.

Board malfeasance (3, Interesting)

If I own Dell stock and I claim that limiting Icahn's ownership undermines my share value (which it probably does), I could sue the company.

I think this actually works in favor of the shareholders. If he was able to buy a controlling interest at current share prices, he could approve any takeover proposal he wanted and make off with the company for less than either of the proposals would. On the other hand, a bidding war would be for all outstanding shares and usually represents a premium over the current trading price. So limiting the shares he could acquire outside of that is good for shareholders since that premium is fairly significant.

No - that not true. If it were M. Dell would have approved his own takeover.The board has to independently review all offers and pick the best one. That is why the board 1. formed a special sub-committee that M. Dell was not on and 2. got a "shop around" option and 3. was given enough cash to hire some Wall Street investment banker types.. This is standard in terms of handling conflicts of interest like this.

Your Naive if you think there is a soul on the board of directors that wasn't hand picked by Dell. Most boards of public companies these days are friends of the CEO (often CEO's of other companies) picked and appointed by the CEO. It one of the primary reason the entire system is gamed against the small investor (the other being institutional investors taking no active role in management or voting through the often significant stock positions they hold).

Your criticisms are fair, but I would like to make a point.Some boards are strong and independent, others are weak and are captured by management. And there is always questions about balancing management (long term vision, fat contracts) verses the small investor (many contradiction voices, often short term, and the real owners of the companies.)Historically speaking, boards tend to do poorly when it comes to manager pay / performance, long term planning, and selecting a new CEO. However, they tend to do much better job in kicking out CEOs and handling being bought out.

Who is the "they" here? The employees of the company? Shareholders?In either case I don't think it's relevant; my comment was more an observation of the fact that some people believe the only purpose of companies is to make money for the owners.I might, though, go so far as to argue that most shareholders "do it" for almost nothing: they risk only financial loss, but have no responsibility for the activities of their company. Have shareholders ever been held responsible for the actions of the company they "own"?

Who in this thread is one of those people? I didn't see anyone. I still don't get where the "shame" is supposed to be going.The largest shareholders are pension fund companies and mutual fund companies. So if you have a pension plan (401k, IRA, etc.), or if you have shares in a mutual fund, then you probably own some Dell shares. So most people in this thread are "one of those people" whether they realize it or not.

Have shareholders ever been held responsible for the actions of the company they "own"?I think you - and probably most Slashdotters - misunderstand the whole purpose of corporations as compared to partnerships or proprietorships. This is a gross oversimplification, and I'm only familiar with US company structures, but here's the real short version: Companies can take many forms, but the most common are sole proprietorships, partnerships (regular or limited liability, etc.) or corporations. In a sole proprietorship or partnership, the shareholders are legally responsible for the actions of the company (to varying degrees). If your sole proprietorship/partnership violates the law or racks up huge debts, guess who they're coming after personally? You. That's why these company structures are only suitable when there is just a small group of owners who are all involved in the running of the business and can thus accept the risk of being responsible for it.If you want lots and lots (thousands or millions) of people to buy stock in your company (thereby funding it through their purchase in your IPO), that's not going to happen if they're all individually responsible for the actions of the corporation. For example, it makes no sense for a little old lady whose retirement fund holds shares in BP to be held responsible for the failure of their GoM drilling rigs. So you create a "corporation" which has the legal fiction of personhood that is separate from the shareholders. So if the corporation violates laws or goes down in flames owing big piles of cash, you can go after the executives and/or give the "death sentence" to the corporation (e.g. the Bell System antitrust breakup, Chapter 7 bankruptcy, etc.) but you can't hold the shareholders responsible. Note though that this isn't 100% true - courts can "pierce the corporate veil" if you have a corporation that is being run like an individual's fiefdom with no oversight, and hold the individuals liable as well like it was a sole proprietorship or partnership.The above explanation is way, WAY oversimplified but I can't think of any way to explain it in a detailed fashion with a car analogy.

Undoing my moderation for this;Doesn't it? Is it really fair for her to neglect her responsibility as an elder in the community for the sake of convenience and profit? If so, the floating ice sheet method of retirement appears equally good.If she is too infirm to make decisions to this end, someone else should be managing her wealth. If not, I profess that she should still be considered legally responsible for her actions which are buying, voting with dollars, exercising power. - I poo-poo your 'little old lady' rhetoric.

That's really not practical at scale. Investors have to diversify their risks in order to have some sense of financial security. You can't expect each of the countries millions of investors to understand every one of the hundreds or thousands of companies they might be directly or indirectly invested in. You even mention "someone else managing her wealth", which adds another layer of abstraction to the problem rather than solving it. If you let people sue a company and go after the shareholders in the process, the investment system would collapse. Nobody would sensibly invest in corporations under a system like that; it would be far too risky.

And it is a shame that people don't understand what profit is.Are you doing a good job, are you adding economic value, producing something society wants? If you do, then you generate profits. If not – well – not so much. Don't think corporations are adding value? They you are using a measuring stick that society does not use. Don't like it? Get society to change the measuring stick they use. (And this is not a glib comment.)

I would disagree. I would bet that most of the examples you point out were due to fraud, greed, or manias. These are human conditions that exist without the profit motive. Or, another way to put it, capitalism (either in it's left wing “socialism light” or your hard right liberation form) is like democracy – a horrible system whose only saving grace is that it is better then any other system.

You're the naive one. Your value system doesn't match the way the Real World works (and by Real World I don't mean a certain set of human laws in a certain country, I mean the Natural Law of things like supply and demand and human motivations and what-not). Valuable things are, by definition, economically valuable. If a firm goes broke providing valuable things, were they providing them at too cheap a cost? Were they completely mismanaging themselves and spending all their revenue on hookers and blow? If they actually produced a Valuable Product, and sold it at a Reasonable Market Cost, they'd be doing well, not going broke.The disconnect here is you're defining Valuable as "something a bleeding heart thinks is awesome for the goodness of mankind and/or the planet", when the real definition is "something humans value, and therefore will exchange money or other equivalents for". You're defining "predatory and destructive" as "something I don't like because it 'hurts the planet'". That may be a valid thing (saying a company is Evil for Destroying the Planet), but it has nothing to do with economic value. Is BP's drilling in the Gulf predatory and destructive? You might naively say "They're hurting Mother Earth in the name of evil stinky oil profits!" Someone else might say: if BP didn't pump oil out of that well, the cost of home heating oil and gasoline would've raised the next winter in the northeastern US by X%, and statistically as a result Y people would've been injured, killed, or lost their livelihoods (all of these things happen due to expensive energy: people can't afford heating bills and freeze to death. people run out of gas money to get to work and lose their jobs. etc). It's hard to paint any corporate action as intrinsically destructive or predatory, as those are subject, narrow views of any action. What's easier to define is being Fradulent. A corporation can certainly be fradulent by lying and making false contractual claims.

I don't see the issue with calling "hurts the planet" predatory and destructive. Environmental impact/pollution are the text book examples of economic externalities.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExternalityFor the same reason that your right to extend your fist ends at my face, a lot of liberal gripes about laissez faire capitalism are legitimate.98% of the population considers human trafficking & sexual slavery immoral? That's OK! 2% of the population is willing to take a shit on the communal porch and fill a market demand.Suburb has a noise ordnance to allow productive members of society to get some sleep before work? Fuck that! Johnny Nightclub can exploit the deregulation of Commercial vs Residential zoning laws to open a 24/7 rave/disco/strip club taking advantage of the cheaper real estate prices.Coral Reefs/Rain forests are considered to be cherished treasures of the planet? Buy a politician in South America/Southeast Asia and it's Seahorse Powder & cheap cattleland for McHambugers!No "tragedy of the commons" is too sacred for commercial exploitation. It is the arbitrage of decency. I argue that the store that refuses to hire employees full time for a decent wage because they can suck at the public food-stamp teat is doing a favor for NOBODY. That type of reduced employment rate is no less than tax-payer subsidized slavery(buying voters with their own lost wages) with all of the staples of economic dysfunction that went with it.Slavery is believed by modern day schools of thought on management to be less profitable than giving the employee the means to provide their own room & board. So it follows that government subsidized wage-slavery meets the definition of a broken-window fallacy. All in the name of reducing unemployment.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capturehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulation_by_dispossessionhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seekinghttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problemhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_rentA lot of the intuitive aspects of the "austrian school" on economics have been demonstrated to be false:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paradoxes#Economicshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson's_paradoxI say all of this as a social-libertarian/economic conservative, and Ron Paul supporter since 2007. Free-market idealism is just a different flavor of oligarchy from communism. Zealotry is bad m'kay?

If you own Dell stock and you claim that limiting ownership undermines your share value, then GO SUE THE FUCKING COMPANY.Either you do, or you don't, and either you can or you can't. Plenty of companies have made millions, or billions, before someone actually sued them and got a court order for them to stop their shenanigans.No one here gives a shit until someone who actually has standing to sue does so, with a valid, comprehensible, lucid argument that stands up in a legal argument. If you don't, or you can't, no one here cares.

This means that Dell i.e. Mickey Dell and/or Bill Gates separately or combined own more than 15% of Dell Shares.Bottom line: Mickey Dell has the Dell Board eating from the fly slit of his shorts and they wont let go.
