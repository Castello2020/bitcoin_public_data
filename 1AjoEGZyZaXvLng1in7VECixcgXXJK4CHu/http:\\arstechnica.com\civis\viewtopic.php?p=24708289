              Edit:  Sorry, I finished reading the article and what I wrote below is not what the story is about.  The story is about encrypting the body of the message and sharing the keys and not about hosting email on their own servers.<br /><br /><br />I admit I only read the first page and I feel this is great for people who host their email server on their own machines.  This ensures end to end encryption without a middleman.<br /><br />For those of us who use an email service such as Gmail, wouldn't an easier solution be to use the POP3 settings to send all email to your local machine and have it deleted on the email server?<br /><br />Supposedly, the Gov can look at email that has been left on the server after 3 months, so having the emails stored locally on your machine and deleted off the hosting server is a solution to keep email out of the servers.<br /><br />Of course that is assuming that the Gov plays by the rules and assuming that the email hosting service really does delete email on their servers and does not hold on to deleted email indefinitely.

              Why I don't bother:<br /><br />The concept of asymmetric encryption is appealing, but the problem for me is that I typically wipe my computer every 6 months or so, and keeping up with the key pair has proven to be remarkably challenging. Since I don't actually use the key pair for much of anything, keeping it safe while I reinstall is not something foremost on my mind. (as a power user, I tend to install an unthinkable amount of random crap constantly and I find it's just easiest to wipe the whole thing to get that fresh &quot;new computer smell&quot; back.)<br /><br />If more people I know used asymmetric key pairs, I'm sure I'd keep up with them better though. The other issue is having a Galaxy Nexus, iPod touch, nexus 10, desktop, and other small devices laying around implies a decent amount of effort to sync all of these devices up to the same key pair.<br /><br />Maybe someday I'll figure out a way to use this stuff, or maybe I'll write my own programs that take all the hassle out of it... who knows. Encryption is important.

              I've been playing around with GnuPG for email encryption over the last week or so and have found that the biggest barrier is the difficulty in setting it up for the average user, so this writeup is great.<br /><br />My next biggest question:  How do you your public key out there?  Currently I've uploaded it to a keyserver and have a link to it in my email signature.<br /><br />Is there a better way?

              Great article!<br /><br />However, until everyone (or at least, everyone you communicate with) uses encryption, there's no use for it for the average user. I'd like to use encrypted email, but sadly, unless I feel like teaching every single person I know how to read my encrypted emails, it's useless to me.<br /><br />The first person (or people) that makes a nice, transparent, hands-off solution for encrypted email is going to make millions.

It's too much hassle, and it especially is for the average user.

              A few things are missing from this article.<br /><br />There is a public infrastructure of OpenPGP public key servers.<br />You can upload your public key there and you can fetch other people's public keys, making it easier to share.<br /><br />However, this does not fix the issue of trusting keys. Ie &quot;I have this public key that says Peter Bright, but does it really belong to Peter Bright?<br />PGP/GPG uses a web of trust model: if Alice sign's Bob's key and Bob sign's Claire's key, then Alice will trust Claire's key too.

              Once it's installed, sending encrypted messages on OSX with GPGTools is *extremely easy*, since it can be done with the services menu.<br /><br />1) Open your mailer app of choice and compose your message.<br /><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/enc01.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />2) Select the text to encrypt (usually the whole message body), then right-click and select Services &gt; OpenPGP:Encrypt<br /><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/enc02.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />3) From the pop-up dialog, select the public key of your recipient from your list of public keys. Optionally (but recommended), check the box to sign your message and add yourself to the recipient list so you can decrypt it yourself.<br /><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/enc03.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />4) Enter your own private key's passcode to enable GPGTools to use it to cryptographically sign your message.<br /><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/enc04.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />5) The highlighted text is replaced with ciphertext.<br /><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/enc05.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />6) Send your message. Done.

              If I use outlook or thunderbird as my client to access gmail, do these methods still provide me security? It sounds like they would.<br /><br />But it also sounds like I couldn't access my email from anywhere but my main PC. Presumably my smart phone doesn't support GPG or S/MIME, and thats unfortunate, because its my main email client.<br /><br />Do password managers also support key pair/certificate storage? so that I could get lastpass or 1password on my phone (or my work PC), and use it to decrypt my mail? That would be nice.

              &quot;Since making encryption the default is in most cases impractical, most users of encrypted mail will be better served by encrypting only sensitive communications.&quot;<br /><br />I've got to object to that recommendation. Only encrypting &quot;sensitive&quot; stuff is like broadcasting &quot;Look here! Look here!&quot; when those persons from whom you're trying to hide your communications do end up with possession. That's especially true since the meta data is not encrypted. You're broadcasting when and where you're emailing sensitive information.<br /><br />If you really want to hide information but leave it on a public server you'll need to establish several different public keys and fill your inbox with mail to each. That will require the snooper to break several private keys to get to the &quot;good stuff.&quot;

              How much metadata is still exposed with these solutions? Seems like at least the recipient address would still have to be there, and probably the sending IP (though you could Tor that). Of course, when it occurred and how large a message would be visible (though you could pad a small message). If the sender identity is sufficiently hidden, I suppose that probably would be enough to inhibit building a good map of connections between senders/recipients.<br /><br />I'm glad nothing I do is interesting enough that I have to actually worry about these issues ;-)  Actually, I did use GnuPG for sending credit card information from web servers to merchants many years ago before giving up on trying to comply with PCI myself and outsourcing CC handling.

While later mentioning that support is built-in to mobile clients as well, no mention of how to set that up is made. Abstract &quot;costs&quot; are mentioned for a certificate with identity verification, but no mention of what said costs are ($60 for 2 years from StartCom, for anyone interested).

It's also an easy way to reduce false positives in spam filtering. That even financial institutions do not sign mail is not because it's hard, it's for the same sort of reasons that many banks still require a 6-8 character alphanumeric password, a few &quot;security questions&quot; such as &quot;Who was your mom?&quot; and call it done.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The process is also error-prone.</div><br />What. No it's not. Is the lock shut? It's encrypted. Is the lock open? It's not. If it's not possible to encrypt, the lock will be greyed out.<br /><br />So yeah, disappointing all around. Secure email is one of the most convenient ways to have secure communications with another person anywhere on the world. That it's not perfect or could use more development is not a great reason to tell everyone not to bother, particularly given that improvements won't come without more demand.

              The article didn't mention Tormail (an email onion within the Tor network). It's not exactly run-of-the-mill but I've got to believe it's more secure.

              Yes, as mentioned, metadata isn't encrypted, only the contents are. There's other techniques to hide that you are communicating with someone at all, most of which are not useful or friendly to the everyday user. Steganography in imageboards, usenet, etc. <br /><br />Email being plaintext is not really a bug. Back in the day, usenet was plaintext at all. Thus evolved schemes of encoding binaries into the appropriate length and format for posting into text streams. The same applies for cryptographically signed or encrypted materials. You can then use whatever transport you want.<br /><br />I mostly agree with Xoa. Even just signing via your bank's certificate will reduce phishing (until some smart cookie puts something similar in the graphical HTML email, thus reducing it again to a PEBKAC problem.)

              I tried using GPG tools on the mac I really did. It didn't last though. Until these tools become easy to use they won't take off in the general public.

              All that's happened over the last couple of weeks makes it clear to me that at least as important as it to stop people from reading the contents of email it's equally important to hid the relationships that are made apparent by it.<br /><br />It'd be nice to have an email client that would be contentiously adding noise to a distributed database.  Whenever I wanted to send a message to someone I'd start sending an encrypted stream of data that would appear to be noise.  That way anyone listening wouldn't know that a message was being sent and wouldn't know who it was being sent to.<br /><br />I guess it's not possible though - on some level every message has to have a to address.  It doesn't really matter if it's user@domain or a 50 digit random string, you can always translate it back to the source.

              What surprises me the most is that with all the resources Google has, there's a lot of potential to make really quite easy (and streamlined) within GMail. I think that would be a game changer.<br /><br />It just seems to me that the era of e-mail client's is over - especially with how good online editors have become (whether you love or hate MS, try Outlook.com -- it's <span style="font-weight: bold">beautiful</span>).<br /><br />Regardless, +1 to the article, +2 for the explanations. Explaining assymetry and the necessity for it isn't easy.

Once the technology is streamlined enough that it only requires the click of a  check box, and yet people still don't adopt it, that would be a social issue. The fact that this article needs to be three pages long, nicely illustrates how there are still too many technological hurdles for widespread adoption.

              Having the messages themselves be encrypted is really the ***ONLY*** solution, for e-mail, even if you have your own personal e-mail server.<br /><br /><br />The SMTP protocol used between mail servers has no encryption support.  So any e-mail that goes outside whatever webmail service you use (meaning pretty much anything where the sender and receiver are not in the same domain) is subject to wholesale monitoring of the internet.

If you <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> that, say, PayPal will never be sending an unsigned mail, then it's possible to be vastly more aggressive about detection and auto purging with no need to worry about false positives.<br /><br />Also, the &quot;signed/encrypted&quot; chrome exists outside the email body, and could also be made more prominent (and should be, but one step at a time).

It's not impossible though to at least make sure you aren't low hanging fruit.<br /><br />Or I guess in many countries you could also just create throwaway accounts on free services at will and send them via war driving, though that requires significant work as well.

              An option I missed is a solution for those that want to keep using web-based clients.<br /><br />Mailvelope is a very easy way to set up PGP: it's a Chrome extension (a Firefox addon is on its way) that will encrypt/decrypt your mails locally. It's extremely easy and works great. It's a young project though, so some things are missing: signing messages and verrifying them is not yet supported. But basic encryption works great, and the integration with any webbased client (litterelly every client: you can select any text-field on a page and encrypt the text you type in it) is really really polished.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mailvelope.com/">http://mailvelope.com/</a><!-- m -->

              E-mail encryption could be approached in two ways: user-to-user and domain-to-domain.<br /><br />In the user to user approach, each user would share public keys with each other, for encrypting e-mail. The challenge here is that this starts getting technical for most people and for many people e-mail is as technical as they want things to get. To change this you have to make encryption easier to use by people, especially the people who are techies - the expectation should just be click and send. Maybe we need to revisit how public keys are shared?<br /><br />In the domain to domain approach, domains would share a public key (maybe via a DNS record?), for encrypting e-mail on transport. This would mean any intermediate relays would not be able to see the content of the e-mail. The issue here, is while this solves the snooping relays, it says nothing to the people using the service whether the service in itself can be trusted.<br /><br />The ideal solution might be a combination of both solutions, but ultimately encryption, like many other security problems comes down to an issue of trust and time. How much security is good enough and how much is just being overly crazy paranoid? It is always protecting yourself from prying eyes, but still having the convenience and ease of use of the tool.
