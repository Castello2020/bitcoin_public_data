Basics:Eve-Online is a space MMORPG where you can fly around in internet spaceships and blow other people up in myriad and hilarious ways. OR you could make the ships that other people use to blow themselves and others up. Basically, you can do a lot of stuff. The crux of Eve-Online is choice, where you get to do pretty much anything you want. There are no "races" in a traditional sense in Eve-Online, nor are there traditional "classes". You are pretty much your ship, and what defines you so to speak is the ship you happen to be flying at the moment. If you want to know more about the mechanics of how Eve-Online works, this:http://episteme.arstechnica.co...5/m/157006929731/p/1is an excellent place to start. The links in the OP of that thread are still good. A Personal Note: In this thread, you may see us bickering at each other. This is going to happen; all of the arsians playing Eve are not aligned in the same corporation or alliance (think guild). We fight each other from time to time in game and it kind of spills over here. It's *going* to happen, and there's really no way to stop it. After all, Eve is fundamentally a PvP game.That being said, to those arsians who have participated in previous threads, I'd like to see an effort to keep the blows above the belt. I'm not going to stop people from disagreeing with one another on the issues (I have no desire to see 200 pages of circlejerking) Previous iterations of this thread: (from latest to earliest)Shiny Happy Arsians Playing Eve 3: http://episteme.arstechnica.co...5/m/358004443931/p/1Shiny Happy Arsians Playing Eve 2: http://episteme.arstechnica.co...5/m/162005666831/p/1Shiny Happy Arsians Playing Eve: http://episteme.arstechnica.co...5/m/292002453831/p/1Ex Coelis: http://episteme.arstechnica.co...09975/m/403008829731Ars Calestis: http://episteme.arstechnica.co...09975/m/188003442831Other Links:Ars Ex Discordia Admission PolicyEx Coelis Admission Policy -Alpha

Grinding Sansha hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be. I guess that it helps that I'm training the social skills at the same time though.

If you try Eve and you're a member here at Ars then don't be afraid to join Arsclan chat channel. This group is noob-friendly and very helpful.

After a few months away, I seem to be starting to consider returning to EVE, which is worrying me. I don't want to, but it calls. Plus I sold my PC, which means EVE on a 13" laptop or a Mac Mini. D0rk Angle

It took a dive on my 13" laptop when I had to switch to the new client.If you have a passably decent graphics card though it should be ok.

If it's a newer Mac Mini with the 9400M, it will actually run Eve reasonably well. Not spectacularly, but it's usable.

The Mini is a current model, the laptop is an XPS m1330 with the 9400GS video. More or less the same (doomed to failure) video cards.I used to play EVE on a dual 3GHz PC with a 8800GTS and it was OK but could choke on fleet fights.

Does the 14-day trial require a key from someone already playing like CoH?

You can get a 21 day trial by downloading it from Steam or by getting someone who's already playing to send you a buddy invitation; if you take the latter option and end up subscribing, the person who referred you gets a month of free game time, and so they should give you quite a few ISKies by way of compensation.

New thread is still on first page, and ExCo's secret weapon is already revealed .But it worked pretty well actually. BoB disbanded because they were terrified about us using it against them. Goons will probably leave the game en masse now that they know it exists. The plan is going well...

I don't quite understand what the hell you'd want a bank in EVE for? Do they pay good interest or something?It's not like you can get robbed of your money in space...

Drama factories They give interest. From the banks point of view, it's a way to raise capital to invest in other businesses.

According to their website accounts bear a monthly 1.5% interest rate which compounds daily at a rate of 0.05%. Which isn't too bad I suppose if you want to take a chunk of isk and let it work for you, or if you're taking an extended break from the game and won't be doing anything with it.

quote:I don't quite understand what the hell you'd want a bank in EVE for? Certain large projects like Capital Ship production require huge outlays of capital in order to acquire the blueprints and mineral resources required to begin production. That's without even thinking about running one or more POS, in order to have your own build slots for all those ship components.Many corporations do this kind of thing internally, where the trust relationships are stronger, in order to get the money together for big projects. This kind of public bank in EVE has always struck me as problematic because there's no deposit insurance. You are essentially just gambling your ISK, hoping that you make a decent return before getting ripped off.

Tier 2 BS BPOs are a bil each, all the cap ship BPOs are a bil+ each, the T2 BPO is shitty but still a T2 BPO so at least a bil as well. Probably 80b on the low end to 200b on the high.

I'm downloading the trial client at the moment. EVE was one of those games I always wanted to try but I never picked it up.I'm searching around looking for as much information that I can, but one quick question:Can different races be in the same corp?
