Now that Apple is selling and renting movies and TV shows in 1080p, the obvious question is: how do these downloads compare to Blu-ray? Ars investigates.

Yeah, I really can't tell the difference between most of those examples. Watching them from a normal distance, I expect the sources are indistinguishable.

Great comparison. Overall it looks like the itunes 1080p video is adequate assuming they're not attempting to charge the same price for rental/ownership as a BRD.

I probably couldn't tell the difference for the other features, but the banding would immediately stand out like a sore thumb to me.

This article needs a follow-up with a more definitive study that asks "can 10 people tell the difference between Blu-ray and iTunes 1080p?" Use 10 second clips of a variety of different scenes and report back results!

I think the snapshot images in the article should be posted in 1080x1920 in order to make a fair comparison. I don't see the point of comparing compressed images.

Obviously BR will be better. The question is if the iTunes (or any downloadable media format), is just "good enough". MP3s have replaced the CD, not because they are of better quality, but because they are easy and good enough.I just really hope that BlueRays don't disappear because if you really like a movie of high quality, it's better to get a hard copy.

"Am I being greedy in wanting both good-looking downloads for convenience, as well as buy-once-play-anywhere Blu-ray discs of my all-time favorite movies?"Not remotely, if anything there should be more flexibility and features on the download version to justify you basically paying to ship it. Online movies are convenient and I love stuff like all-you-can-eat LoveFilm but actually owning an optical disc seems much better value if you're into a movie.I want a 40 days of night sequel though.

How many un-skippable trailers, advertisements, and copyright notices does the iTunes copy of the movie "feature"?

One thing that's being missed with this comparison between iTunes and physical media is that Apple has already shown that it will upgrade titles purchased previously (720p to 1080p). In a few years, Apple could decide to upgrade the quality of their 1080p clips -- or move us to an even higher resolution to take advantage of whatever displays they are selling by then. But all of our BluRay discs will still be where they are today and will require us to purchase new copies of the same movies again to get the better quality.Apple's model was always portrayed as a purchase model where the user gets to continue using whatever media they purchase forever. But it's appearing that it's really more than that -- it's a one time payment for the rights to use and download whatever is the current best format that Apple provides.In this area, iTunes clearly wins over BluRay, IMO.

Surprised the MPAA hasn't been in contact over unauthorised format-shifting of Blu-Ray content and sharing copyrighted material.

As much as it enrages videophiles, it appears as if streaming/downloaded video has finally reached the "good enough" level of quality for most people. In fact, unless the masses take effort to become OCD over picture quality, they might not even be able to discern the difference.Now if only Hollywood would decide to stop dragging its feet on licensing and pricing.

I've moved to 100% digital movie purchases on iTunes. The quality is good enough, it's very easy to use, and I don't have to have a lot of crappy plastic boxes lying around my apt everywhere. Plus, I can play them on my computer, TV, phone, and tablet. What's not to like?

Some discs you have to hit the "Next Section" button to skip the trailers, sometimes it's the Menu button.It's obnoxious but I have yet to run into one where there's actually *no way* to skip.

But to be fair to Apple I don't think they have as much control over the pricing as they would like. Studios would rather not cannibalize their tried and true physical formats for a digital format under someone else's control.I would much rather buy a movie on Blu-ray (wait a couple months and you'll find them for $10) and rip it myself if I feel that I need a digital copy. Of course that means finding the space for the discs but what with the new Kindle my bookshelves were looking pretty barren anyway.ebbv wrote:The Ugly wrote:How many un-skippable trailers, advertisements, and copyright notices does the iTunes copy of the movie "feature"?Every Blu Ray disc I've owned so far the stuff is skippable but it's not always obvious how.

When I watch a movie I want to be able to hit root menu to get past it all in one press and watch the movie I paid for. Having to hit the "next track" button ten times to get to the menu that lets me begin a film is complete BS. But Lions Gate is the only studio I know of that does that on Blu-ray discs and I am not sure if they're still doing it on newer titles. It probably also depends on the player you use. A lot of older DVD players were made to force you to watch all the warnings and trailers up front but newer ones were able to skip all of that.

Unfortunately, most people have a screen that's way too small to see the detail at the viewing distance they use. From what I've seen, in the homes of my friends, many of whom are audio and videophiles, they can't tell the difference between 720 and 1080 from where they sit, and a few can't even get a true 720 from their seating position.I've got a 61" screen, but I also sit too far away, about 12'. I would need a 103" diagonal size screen to see 1080 in full resolution. The truth is that none of the comparisons made here have any validity for the large majority of people.

The only thing that would bug me about the iTunes version is the banding - and that's always been an issue for iTunes videos.Other than that, though, it was really hard to tell the differences. In fact, it's really impressive that you have to get closeups of unimportant details in order to see most of the flaws.

I have to say...I'm more impressed than I thought I'd be. My wife and I cut the cord after doing the math and figuring out it was cheaper to buy seasons on iTunes than pa or cable for a year. We bought a couple of movies but this is what I've been waiting for...except for a few must haves on Blu-ray, I think ee'll be getting our movies here. I'll bet this is the quality tipping point for most consumers.

I'm becoming increasingly disenchanted with Ars tendency to declare absolute results from rather unscientific experiments. (Especially as these results will inevitably get re-reported and trotted out to support arguments they may not, in fact, conclusively support all over the Internet.)While perhaps not invalidating the conclusions in itself, the use of further lossy compression (jpeg) on screenshots/photographs intended to capture the (in)efficiencies and differences of two lossily compressed sources is symptomatic of the issue.

I do wish these were direct screenshots, instead of photos of a monitor. As much as I'd like to poo-poo streaming media, I must admit, the only thing that would drive me nuts here is the banding. When it comes to watching visually arresting movies, I can live with some slightly blown highlights and very minor detail reduction, but banding is a no-go for me.

"Ars was recently able to conclude that the newly launched iTunes movies encoded in 1080p do, in fact, look better than the same content encoded in 720p". No kidding, eh? 1080p looks better than 720p? I bet it looks better than 480p as well Eddie Wilson

If the general public can't tell the difference now what makes you think anybody will be able to in the future. 3D will be the next mountain to clime.

If the resolution is 1920x798, then wouldn't the video be 798p or maybe 1080i? Also, besides gradients, compression usually causes macro-blocking in fast motion scenes. Did you notice any of this during the faster moving scenes in the iTunes video clips?

If anyone has ever seen a still from any film, they would see how bad they look. This was my business for decades. We always had problems with it. The eye and brain integrates movement in a way that has us ignoring much of what the stills are showing. When I had to make stills from a movie frame, no matter how the frame was produced, the still was always disappointing. It was unsharp, noisy, blown out, etc. we just don't notice it when watching the film, unless we're programming ourselves to do so, as you are.The only useful comparisons, other than for technical work, are short sequences viewed together, as we used to have to do. Even then, it could be difficult. A slight change in the playback adjustments would often wipe out much, or all of the differences, or even make the poorer copy look better. Stand back a couple of feet, and all differences due to sharpness, grain, and often, Ben banding goes away.So unless you're anal enough to bring your chair too close to the screen for comfort, or fortunate enough to have a big enough screen, little of this will matter.

Pfft, I went to the Metropolitan Opera last year. Now if they can beat THAT resolution, I'd be impressed. bhahahahahaa....oh....oh I hurt my side....But yeah, slowly and slowly we'll get to the point to where we can buy movies or TV shows and watch them on devices of our choice....which is how we have music now. But remember, even that took a while.
