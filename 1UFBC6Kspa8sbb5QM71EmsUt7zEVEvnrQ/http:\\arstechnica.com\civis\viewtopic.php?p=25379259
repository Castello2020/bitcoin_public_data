              This will not persuade people whose mind are made up to the contrary. <br /><br />We need to start preparing for the worst, while hoping for the best. This means infrastructure changes and plans to move low coastal populations inland. I don't hold much hope for any global solution to change the climate itself. We can slow things down, make minor changes perhaps, but we will have to plan to adapt to these changes.

              Climate denialists are only interested in one thing; continuing to believe that they know the &quot;truth&quot;, that it's all a giant conspiracy by the world governments to mobilise people, or tax people, or do something horrible. They want to feel special, that they, and their friends know the truth while the sheep continue to buy the official story.

              Even if this is true, it begs the question of just how much we ought to sacrifice to prevent it. Do we all take major hits to our standard of living just so the climate, which changes all the time anyway, stays the same just a little longer.

              &quot;The report explains that the 2000s have seen some cooling influence from a slight lull in radiation from the Sun, a number of volcanic eruptions, and natural variability in the ocean (namely, a rash of cool La Niñas)&quot;<br /><br />I don't see how these three things can be considered together. The sun and volcanoes are external influences on the climate; it's obvious to anyone how they would affect the climate. <br /><br />But ocean currents, ninas or ninos or whichever one, are part of, and driven by, the climate. It seems to me like it's saying the climate cooled a bit, because it got cooler.<br /><br />How is it that an ocean current can be considered an external forcing on climate?

              I'm not sure this data will impact any government; local regional or national.<br /><br />But when I bought my second home many years ago I checked for flood plains and elevation above sea level. Presently at 250' I should see off estimated sea rises during my lifetime.

What a shame!<br /><br />The IPCC is actually prepared to dismiss the pause in warming as irrelevant ‘noise’ associated with natural variability. Under pressure, the IPCC now acknowledges the pause and admits that climate models failed to predict it. The IPCC has failed to convincingly explain the pause in terms of external radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar or volcanic forcing; this leaves natural internal variability as the predominant candidate to explain the pause.  If the IPCC attributes to the pause to natural internal variability, then this begs the question as to what extent the warming between 1975 and 2000 can also be explained by natural internal variability.  Not to mention raising questions about the confidence that we should place in the IPCC’s projections of future climate change.

How strange this is. Climate sensitivity is one of the most important parameters. It determines largely how much warming we can expect. If there is lack of agreement between different methods/studies, we want to know all about it. However, apart from this footnote, the SPM is silent about it. Hopefully the full report, which will be released on Monday, will give all the details. <br /><br />Although I doubt it.  They appear to be clueless about their destroyed credibility, and want to pretend like their entire theories and fraudulent warnings the last few decades  have been utterly destroyed by real world observations.

              Ok, so then, we all agree its a problem and we need to act now to fix it right?<br /><br />Then someone please lay out how we fix this?  Replace all our coal power plants...great idea, they're dirty, and not only are they dirty, we have to ship tons of coal all over the place to fuel them. So what do we replace them with? Nuclear? Its the cleanest, and statistically safest, despite what anti-nuclear activists believe.  But too many people are scared off because &quot;omg, teh nukluar plants will leak radiation!!!&quot;. So that won't happen. Wind? Not feasible for everywhere. Solar? Again, not feasible for everywhere, and the eco-nuts are blocking them all over the place because they take up a bunch of land. Hydroelectric? Again, eco nuts don't like that, because it destroys ecosystems and prevents fish migrations (i actually agree with this, we don't need any more hydro plants).<br />So...What do we replace our dirty coal with? And where do we get the billions of dollars to do it?<br /><br />Next, ok, we all agree our cars are filthy, we need to do something to replace all the internal combustion engines out there.  So...how exactly do we replace everybody's car on the entire planet?  We don't even have a viable replacement yet.  And where does the money come from? And what do we do with the existing cars...force everyone to stop driving them (that will go over real well)?<br /><br />Yes we should do something, but I have yet to ever see anyone propose any practical solutions that could actually work, that people will actually agree with.  Have I missed anything out there?

              Bear shits in woods, film at eleven.<br /><br />How many times do the massive majority of climate scientists have to explain that we're dooming ourselves before people stop claiming it's still up for debate?  Of course evolution is still &quot;just a theory&quot; to them, so I don't know why I expect this to ever change.

              Vast majority of the money supports the opposite of this conclusion. If what they're saying is wrong, why haven't those companies (eg coal and gas giants) sponsored solid reports refuting all the claims? The scientists would get a big kudos if it were a robust study, and the global warming claims would be completely undermined. Instead they seem to focus on using the media to spread the idea that there's some massive, international conspiracy between scientists to make people believe this were true.

Replace all our coal power plants...great idea, they're dirty, and not only are they dirty, we have to ship tons of coal all over the place to fuel them. So what do we replace them with? Nuclear? Its the cleanest, and statistically safest, despite what anti-nuclear activists believe.  But too many people are scared off because &quot;omg, teh nukluar plants will leak radiation!!!&quot;. So that won't happen. Wind? Not feasible for everywhere. Solar? Again, not feasible for everywhere, and the eco-nuts are blocking them all over the place because they take up a bunch of land. Hydroelectric? Again, eco nuts don't like that, because it destroys ecosystems and prevents fish migrations (i actually agree with this, we don't need any more hydro plants).<br />So...What do we replace our dirty coal with? And where do we get the billions of dollars to do it?<br /><br />Next, ok, we all agree our cars are filthy, we need to do something to replace all the internal combustion engines out there.  So...how exactly do we replace everybody's car on the entire planet?  We don't even have a viable replacement yet.  And where does the money come from? And what do we do with the existing cars...force everyone to stop driving them (that will go over real well)?<br /><br />Yes we should do something, but I have yet to ever see anyone propose any practical solutions that could actually work, that people will actually agree with.  Have I missed anything out there?</div><br /><br />Sadly you're right, nuclear probably is the best clean option at present, but nobody is interested in increasing their nuclear power because of their concerns about radiation. One option for this would be to push money into liquid fueled versions such as the liquid thorium reactors, which are supposedly both safer and more efficent, with less radioactive waste at the end too. These are a bit of a long shot though, despite being implemented in some countries there's still serious issues which we don't know if we can fix

Now the Ozone layer is rebounding.<br /><br />We didn't come up with cap and trade in either case. Why? because it doesn't solve any problem.<br /><br />If the recommended action for climate change was 'cap and violators will be shot', or 'cap and non-compliant factories will be bulldozed at your expense' I would be on board. Cap and Trade is a tax that will not improve the situation. at all.

They want to feel special, that they, and their friends know the truth while the sheep continue to buy the official story.</div><br /><br />That's a pretty broad brush you are using there.  There are plenty of people like myself.  I do believe we have affected the environment in fairly obvious ways.  I don't believe that we will catastrophically affect the planet in the next 100 years.  I think we should continue to challenge the models which are used to predict such catastrophic outcomes, because they are too simplistic and don't take into account too many variables.  I think it is significant that the warming trend was below the lowest parameters of the prediction range because it showcases these flaws in the models.  <br /><br />Regardless of that, I don't think from a political standpoint that using these reports and predictions as leverage to enact change is ever going to work.  Aside from the fact that they essentially glossed over the huge errors in their predictions over the last 15 years,  I think that most people on both sides just don't care about reducing their carbon footprint (the obvious hypocritical examples from Hollywood are just the surface).  <br /><br />So we should focus efforts in other ways and with other arguments.  Carbon is an illusive concept, but pollution is not for most.  Better gas mileage or reliable alternative energy sources are simply better carrots than global warming.  Companies like Tesla can help radically change behavior by truly innovating.  It's why I own the stock and will someday own a Tesla.  Promote more nuclear power, promote cleaner coal and natural gas.  Show people how they can BENEFIT in tangible ways outside of simply helping combat global warming and they will react.  <br /><br />Even if I am completely wrong regarding the next 100 years the topic has become too polarizing to ever gain real traction.  So for those of you truly concerned about it, find another way to enact change.

Who said we need to?  The costs of mitigation have been considered by others in the past (Garnaut, Stern) and they've found that on the contrary, mitigation is actually cheaper and more cost-effective (i.e. of lesser impact to our standards of living) than doing nothing.<br /><br />Wind power by some accounts is getting comparable to coal in costs, solar energy has plumetted in price.  Who's to say we can't eventually make renewables far cheaper than fossil fuels?<br /><br />We went from zero to putting a man on the moon in 10 years, we invented the atomic bomb in 5 years... Human's capacity to innovate and find solutions is amazing... This is a great opportunity to invest in new technologies and to remove dependencies on a limited and geopolitically complicated supply of fossil fuels (that's just a bonus in addition to saving us from the worst of climate change).</div><br /><br />Then we shouldn't have to subsidize or mandate it right. It should happen through normal market forces, which I am perfectly OK with.</div><br />Except that the reason that wind and solar are finally becoming viable are because of government funded research and subsidies to get the companies off the ground.  The established energy companies had absolutely no reason to ever research technology that would make their entire business model obsolete, and barriers to entry make it pretty much impossible that a free market solution would ever have made either technology happen.  Certainly not before catastrophic damage had been done.

What a shame!<br /><br />The IPCC is actually prepared to dismiss the pause in warming as irrelevant ‘noise’ associated with natural variability. Under pressure, the IPCC now acknowledges the pause and admits that climate models failed to predict it. The IPCC has failed to convincingly explain the pause in terms of external radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar or volcanic forcing; this leaves natural internal variability as the predominant candidate to explain the pause.

What a shame!<br /><br />The IPCC is actually prepared to dismiss the pause in warming as irrelevant ‘noise’ associated with natural variability. Under pressure, the IPCC now acknowledges the pause and admits that climate models failed to predict it. The IPCC has failed to convincingly explain the pause in terms of external radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar or volcanic forcing; this leaves natural internal variability as the predominant candidate to explain the pause.  If the IPCC attributes to the pause to natural internal variability, then this begs the question as to what extent the warming between 1975 and 2000 can also be explained by natural internal variability.

The initial purchase could be seen as a tax, but then it acts like a stock, whose total supply decreases over time.

              This dissembling about the &quot;pause&quot; in warming is shameful. First of all, if anything volcanic activity has been lower than normal over the last couple of decades. Since 2000, we've had at most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions_in_the_21st_century" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">15 volcanic eruptions of VEI 4</a>, nothing larger. Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 was VEI 6, which is the equivalent of 100 VEI 4 eruptions. Plus, larger eruptions like Pinatubo inject SO2 much higher in the stratosphere, where the effects are more widespread and longer-lasting.<br /><br />Second, the prediction of the AGW alarmists has been that <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/09.24/MoreFrequentand.html&quot;" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">AGW would cause more El Nino events</a>. So the reality that La Nina has dominated lately shows again the disconnect between AGW theory and the real world.<br /><br />Third, it is nice to see some lip service payed to solar influence. However, this article doesn't mention the NASA forecast for solar cycle 25, which predicts a much lower cycle than the current Cycle 24 - and it is already the lowest level of solar activity in a century:<br /><br />For some reason the url tag didn't work for this link:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/The-Weakest-Solar-Cycle-in-100-Years-216752671.html">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/The ... 52671.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Regardless of what’s causing the Sun’s strange behavior, Hathaway and Penn, who are both in the solar prediction business, anticipate that Cycle 25, expected to peak in 2024, will be the weakest yet.</div><br />It is very likely we're at the beginning of a Solar Grand Minimum.

Are you really that stupid?  Its a wonder people that stupid can use a computer.  If there existed this magical free market, then maybe it would prioritize renewable energy because it has better future prospects.  But in reality, the economy is somewhere between a game played by human chickens running around with their heads cut off and freaking out at the slightest downturn in any quarterly profit, which pretty much prevents long term investments.  To an oligarchy controlled by a very small number of people who's primary interest is in keeping themselves at the top, and maintaining the status quo.  For them, its easier to keep using oil because it costs less than innovating new solutions, and oil will keep working for them for as long as they're alive so why bother.  As for this mythical ability to break into the free market, between regulations, enormous investments required to start up a car company (just ask Elon) its not so free.  Not to mention, that you have to sell to the dumbest animal on the planet, who won't buy electric cars because of no logical reason whatsoever.  Studies have actually shown, those who don't believe in climate change will choose to pay MORE for a less environmentally friendly product.  Trust me, the free market won't fix anything.  You want more proof, Tesla a highly successful electric car company could only get an investment from the DoE, no private &quot;free market&quot; enterprise was willing to put dollars there.  Well, that's a sufficiently long rant I think.

The sun and volcanoes are external influences on the climate; it's obvious to anyone how they would affect the climate. <br /><br />But ocean currents, ninas or ninos or whichever one, are part of, and driven by, the climate. It seems to me like it's saying the climate cooled a bit, because it got cooler.<br /><br />How is it that an ocean current can be considered an external forcing on climate?</div><br /><br />The dynamics of heat transfer to and from the oceans to the atmosphere are very complex and difficult to model.  The amount of extra heat being trapped by increased CO2 is easy to model.<br /><br />We know there are climatic cycles on the order of decades that result in increased or decreased atmospheric temperatures (La Nina/El Nino being the most well-known).  Over the long-term, they almost by definition have to average out to zero. (the overall heat in the system is the dominant effect).<br /><br />The IPCC report refers to increased heat content in the oceans.  The energy is still building up, that it's not being released into the atmosphere is just a result of natural variability.<br /><br />What we do know is that there has been a dominant La Nina in the last 10 years.  This normally produces cooler temperatures.  Upon the trend line of increasing temperatures over the long-term, this La Nina 'cycle' has only resulted in a slower warming trend for the last 10 years.<br /><br />In some ways the fact that it's still been getting warmer despite the conflation of a weaker solar output and the cyclical cooling of the atmosphere from a La Nina should be ringing alarm bells.  Unfortunately, it seems for many it's not.
