(Though I will say that several patches ago the King Tiger did as well.)  I faced directly at opponents and shot them with great effect.  They shot back at me and I took a bunch of bounces and no damage, even from what I knew to be large calibre weapons.  It was a good time.  I've yet to unlock the largest gun either but this is looking to be a fun tank to play against silly pubbies that want to stand off and shoot - well, they're welcome to do that!</div><br /><br />and much like the ferdi, when you start moving towards them slowly, shrugging off their attacks and continuing to punch holes in them, they get very very uncomfortable. as though by relocating anywhere in a TD is a violation of the conventions of pubbie tank war.<br /><br />roll three T28s together, all moving the same direction, it is very scary.</div><br /><br />That's weird.<br /><br />My T28 is full of holes from the front.  The only time I had scratches is when I managed to angle the hull and fired at them with a rock covering the flat cheek.  Many tier 8s can punch it from the front and the sides and rear are paper thin.<br /><br />The best time I had last night is when BJ, fresh and I derped our way through Himmelsdorf as 3 derp KV-2s and top tanks.

              Want to thank everyone for the great platoons over the last couple of days. BJ, Huggie and I went 22-2 at one stage. Only slighty worse when Joker joined us. Think I finished the day at 30-5-1.<br /><br />Some really great matches in there.<br /><br />I also now have the T110E4. Only one game so far. 100% win rate and avg exp of 1.3k. May just retire it <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

              We bring a lot of e4s to CW these days. I think last night our Swamps battle had 4 of them, and they performed quite well. Definitely a very nice tank, I'm hoping to start playing regularly again next week so I can finish picking mine up before it gets nerfed.

(Though I will say that several patches ago the King Tiger did as well.)  I faced directly at opponents and shot them with great effect.  They shot back at me and I took a bunch of bounces and no damage, even from what I knew to be large calibre weapons.  It was a good time.  I've yet to unlock the largest gun either but this is looking to be a fun tank to play against silly pubbies that want to stand off and shoot - well, they're welcome to do that!</div><br /><br />The T28 with the big gun is fun. One bit of advice is save all your free XP, you need 22K I think, for when you go to the T95 or you'll be a very sad panda. You have to upgrade the tracks to upgrade from the stock gun which is equivalent to mid-tier T28 gun(if my memory is correct). The upgraded tracks let you use the big gun from T28 to start with.  It's absolutely a blast to roll in a T28/95 with an Ars platoon with the heavies shooting over you as you barrel down on the other side. Works really well with American tanks with their serious turret armor but weaker hull armor.

              Introductions: Forum newbie (long time reader on Ars, only recently stumbled into the forums and started reading)<br /><br />Awesome, introductions done.<br /><br />I just started playing this game this weekend and it hooked me by surprise. Had hit one of those lulls where I was looking for something new to play so I was going down the list of F2P games that people talk way too much about. Wasn't expecting much, still had a bit of a stigma in my mind attached to F2P games. This one was actually the last one on the list and I hated it for the first 45 minutes, but then hey, 2 hours later, still playing!<br /><br />Well, the entire weekend later I'm still at it.<br /><br />So the content: As a freshman tanker, what nationality do you think is a good one to dive into first? Not just in terms of learning curve but in terms of long term investment? I don't want to get a few weeks down a nation's tech tree to find out that their later tier tanks suck and I have to start over. (I also realize that a lot will probably come down to personal taste, but hearing from people who've gotten a little further into their trees is always nice).<br /><br />I've already begun working on Germany and am actually between tier III and IV across the entire tree (that's right, I've got pretty much one of each tank at my current tech level).<br /><br />Thoughts? And any objections to a completely random person on the internet hopping into the Ars WoT channel (I could've sworn I read something about one earlier in the thread)? Keep in mind, I don't want to just stay a random person from the internet, but hey, you gotta start somewhere.

              Welcome to the GESC.<br /><br />Generally we take pretty much everyone in WoT from what I've seen.  The original Ars clan is full, but Ars3 has space (though I think there are only 90 in original Ars now, but thats for other, more important people to figure out)<br /><br />Anyway - I'm pretty sure that it doesn't matter which line you chose.  Pick what you find fun, and stick with it.  Every line has its lemons of some sort, and its tanks of awesome... and of course, one person's awesome is another person's trash.<br /><br />My two cents.

              Coming from a fairly new player as well (only up to tier 6), if I had it to do over again I would probably go American.<br /><br />They get heavy tanks 2 tiers earlier than the Germans, if that's your thing. Though same for the Russians. In general the Russian tanks take hits better, but are painfully slow. In my experience (up to KV-1), the Russian tanks are really hard to do a lot of damage with though. My T1 HT (American) can't take as many hits but I can usually wreck a few guys before I go down. Further down the line, the T29 is a tank people rave about.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you <span style="font-weight: bold">don't</span> want a heavy tank the German line has some pretty nice tank destroyers. I'm hesitating to buy the tier 6 because it really doesn't seem an upgrade from the tier 5 once you take the higher matchmaking into account. Once you get to tier 8, they're amazing.<br /><br />This is really just a new player's gut instinct, so take it with a grain of salt, but I haven't really been a big fan of the German line that I went with. I consistently get wrecked by a myriad of American tanks and keep kicking myself for not going with them earlier.<br /><br />P.S. Screw artillery and everyone who plays them!  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/razz.png" alt=":p" title="Razz" /><br /><br />P.P.S. Avoid any light tanks like the plague. They get matched on average about 3 tiers higher than them, since they're considered scouts. What that means is you won't touch anyone, and will die on one hit. Not fun. Not much XP either.

              If you're interested in the all-rounder/flanking style of mediums, the American line is also very nice. It has several stand-out tanks, the two most highlighted are probably the T6 M4E8 (or Easy Eight) and the T8 M26 Pershing. Both are very balanced and serious fun. I wound up going down the German medium tree to T8 - and although I've heard the E50 is great fun fully kitted out, for me the tree stops at T6 with the awesome VKs - 3601 and 3001H are both great, in different ways.<br /><br />On the TD side, Germans get to the land of heavy frontal armor the quickest, and pretty much stay that way. Americans have the option of turreted TDs, which is an interested play style which people often make the mistake of playing like tanks. Russians start off with fairly low armor, but get big guns pretty quickly, and the last few are an interesting combo of good armor (frontal), huge gun and reasonable speed.<br /><br />The Heavy lines can (generally) be boiled down to this: German - sloped armor that requires angling, accurate guns. American - very strong turrets, balanced accuracy/damage/reload. Russian - slower, lower, generally highest &quot;alpha&quot; for their tier (per shot damage), heavy armor.<br /><br />Americans get lots of love when you can cover your hull, since their very high turret armor combines nicely with their higher then average depression, allowing shots when all the opponant can shoot back at is something they cant penetrate. Germans are generally best at range, where they can angle their armor (rotating the tank at a slight offset to incoming rounds to increase the effective armor) and take advantage of their accurage. Russians like to get up close and brawl, the later tanks do get some accurate guns though.<br /><br />Edit: I tried to play a couple games over the weekend, hopped in to the ELC just to see what's up, and it's highly amusing. I can totally see why you guys are calling it the new troll tank. Only downside is the reload (well, and the one shottable nature of it, got derped by a 122), but it's pretty accurate. Ran one game in my T20, wound up playing peekaboo with some much larger tanks, walked out with a 600ish xp loss. Fun times, looking forward to getting back in the game here in two weeks.

              Hello Defiant107,<br />There are several sweet rides in each nationality.  Some tanks are better suited to different play styles, and are very VERY short lived and frustrating if you play certain tanks &quot;wrong&quot;.  The game is developed, owned and maintained by Russians.  There is a &quot;bit&quot; of bias towards the Russian line, and thus far, certain Russian tanks (non premium) that seem to make a profit just by showing up.  KV's line seems to be one, though it recently underwent major surgery, so I have kept only a couple.<br /><br />It appears that all lines have a plateau, it is pretty easy to get to about tier 4 or 5, but (depending on the line) it tends to be a slow grind to get to the  next tier, where it is a bit less of a grind.  At 7 and above it just takes a long time to progress through.<br /><br />I found the German line of arty fun through the Hummel, where it is a long reach to get to the GwPanther, which is highly thought of by my regular plt mates.  <br />In the French line, the AMX 40 is usually not spoken of in polite company as the resulting denigrating comments are not fit for young ears.  Get past that and you unlock the ELC AMX which sorta a clown car of death.  Great humor, speed and acceleration like Hammie the Squirrel big gun, sloooowwww reload, soft and squishy.  Arguably the most entertaining and frustrating tank at Tier 5 in the game. <br /><br />American TDs have two branches, the turreted line including the M18 are fun for me.  Not good brawlers by any stretch, but good TDs.  The American line has some very good tanks in the line, the Tier V M5 Sherman is very formidable with the baby derp (I have started calling it the BURP) and has quick reload for a BURP.  It is not for going toe to toe with a VK3601H, more like peek and smash and duck fast, like a pie in the face.  The Tier 6 M4AE2 and M4AE8 follow, the E2 is slower and has fairly good armor, I don't have that one, the E8 or &quot;easy 8&quot; has great mobility and maneuverability and quick firing decent penetrating gun.  One notable feature of the American line is that they tend to have the best gun depression.  This is particularly noticeable when on very hilly maps.  This in turn means that there are &quot;great&quot; spots to roll up to in an American tanks that are foolish to go to with most other lines.<br /><br />So, unless there is a particular reason to focus solely on one nationality, you may wish to consider multiple lines concurrently.  Pursuing multiple lines adds variety to your stable, and makes it a little easier to Plt up with other Arsians.<br /><br />Platooning up with 1 or 2 other Arsians and using Team Speak (or other suitable voice comms) will do wonders for your learning curve, and your level of enjoyment as well.

              Yeah, with the last big gun on the T28, it's a monster you don't want to be in the cross hairs of. I have yet to make less than 35k credits from a match now. And the reload time seems to be faster than with the smaller gun.

              I would go any nation EXCEPT France.  French low-tier tanks are serious pain.<br /><br />Being moderately OCD, I have a different account for each nation.  For my style of play (fairly aggressive, but I also like sniping), the German line has the best win percentage for me, followed by Russian, American, and then French.  I do find the US tanks to be the most fun to play, though.

              Best advice when starting out is to pick a nation (not France, as mentioned) and go up more than one line (ideally, two, or your pace upward will be pretty slow) <span style="font-style: italic">in the same nation</span>. Because modules on various vehicles, such as guns, radios, engines (but never tracks) are shared across different lines, your progress up multiple lines in one nation will benefit from cross-unlocking and, thus, be faster!<br /><br />I would recommend the US as the best choice for a first nation, since it features the most well-balanced tanks and great TDs. But you won't go wrong starting with Soviets, Germans or Americans. If you are sure you want to pursue artillery, though, I would recommend Germany.

              I'll put in a vote for the American TDs. The Hellcat is ridiculous fun (up to 450 damage every 6 seconds, penetrates damn near everything, does 75km/h, has a low profile...). The T49 before it is also great, and there's nothing wrong with the Wolverine either.

But I've kind of come to understand that crews are really locked at an even greater level to their tank because of the glacial rate at which they earn experience and that they pretty much have to start over when you switch vehicles. So I probably will start branching out a bit now.<br /><br />Based on what I've heard back here so far, I'm going to start heading down the American tree as well. There are a few gems at the beginning of the German line that I've grown to like. I'm at work so I couldn't tell you which is my favorite, I just know there's one that I do pretty well in (1st class mastery). I also enjoy sniping a bit so I lucked out there.<br /><br />Arty is an interesting playstyle, but my first and only experience is the Bison atm and it's pretty brutal. That thing takes sooooooo long to zero in.

              As a relative newbie (a few weeks prior to Unison), there's some great advice.  I second the US line.  My friend Kaeos has ground the TD line and enjoys them quite a bit.  He's also gone up to the KV-3 in the Russian line, but after seeing some of the US line, I think he's decided to go US heavy as well. I have ground all four lines to some degree...and two of the most painful grinds in the game (imho), the French light line and to the German Pz IV.  Don't do the french line first.  I ended up free xp'ing through parts of the AMX 38 and 40...just awful.  I did it to make sure I could get an ELC, which I thoroughly enjoy, but more on that later.  The AMX 1375 was a blast to play pre-patch, but I haven't played it much since the patch because I've really enjoyed the US line.<br /><br />The Pz IV is a great tank (along with some of the tanks after), but the grind (although not as bad as the french lights) is still bad because of the 38na. It's not a bad tank, just gets screwed in Matchmaking (MM)all...the...time.<br /><br />If I had to do it all again, I'd explore the US heavy/td line first...then maybe the Germans and French.<br /><br />As far as the ELC...well I have to brag a little bit.  Granted, it was x2 and I have premium (for 1 more week, I think), but still...<br /><br />Victory!<br />Battle: Malinovka Wednesday, August 08, 2012 10:27:14 AM<br />Vehicle: ELC AMX<br />Experience received: 2,912 (x2 for the first victory each day)<br />Credits received: 44,275 (compensation for damage caused by allies: 395)<br />Battle Achievements: Mastery Badge: &quot;1st Class&quot;<br /><br />It was a standard map, for once.  My team was just sitting there camping, so I went across the field to spot for a little bit.  Survived...then went up the hill and back down around the school house and spotted some more.  Did the hill again and went down past the school for arty.  We ended up winning thanks to great arty.

              As a relative newbie (a few weeks prior to Unison), there's some great advice.  I second the US line.  My friend Kaeos has ground the TD line and enjoys them quite a bit.  He's also gone up to the KV-3 in the Russian line, but after seeing some of the US line, I think he's decided to go US heavy as well. I have ground all four lines to some degree...and two of the most painful grinds in the game (imho), the French light line and to the German Pz IV.  Don't do the french line first.  I ended up free xp'ing through parts of the AMX 38 and 40...just awful.  I did it to make sure I could get an ELC, which I thoroughly enjoy, but more on that later.  The AMX 1375 was a blast to play pre-patch, but I haven't played it much since the patch because I've really enjoyed the US line.<br /><br />The Pz IV is a great tank (along with some of the tanks after), but the grind (although not as bad as the french lights) is still bad because of the 38na. It's not a bad tank, just gets screwed in Matchmaking (MM)all...the...time.<br /><br />If I had to do it all again, I'd explore the US heavy/td line first...then maybe the Germans and French.<br /><br />As far as the ELC...well I have to brag a little bit.  Granted, it was x2 and I have premium (for 1 more week, I think), but still...<br /><br />Victory!<br />Battle: Malinovka Wednesday, August 08, 2012 10:27:14 AM<br />Vehicle: ELC AMX<br />Experience received: 2,912 (x2 for the first victory each day)<br />Credits received: 44,275 (compensation for damage caused by allies: 395)<br />Battle Achievements: Mastery Badge: &quot;1st Class&quot;<br /><br />It was a standard map, for once.  My team was just sitting there camping, so I went across the field to spot for a little bit.  Survived...then went up the hill and back down around the school house and spotted some more.  Did the hill again and went down past the school for arty.  We ended up winning thanks to great arty.

              Tier 4 is going to suck, no matter what you do. You just have to get through it. It represents the late interwar period when all the great powers were churning out new-fangled but wrongheaded infantry tanks and mini-land-dreadnoughts. They show their suckage when up against tier 5 and higher, which represent tank design that begins to respond to WWII-experience-hardened armour doctrine. Suffice it to say they all kinda suck. The Soviet T-28 might be the only exception to those, owing to its fantastic gunnage and relatively peppy mobility (and not being a light tank, so it gets proper tiering). The M5 Stuart and PzIII are also decent, but lights, so you get that tiering problem.<br /><br />But the overall point here is grit your teeth and push through whatever tier 4 tank you have, and then prepare to bask in the glory that is tier 5, as far as I'm concerned one of the best overall tiers in the game, with a vast multitude of tanks in every nation that are well-rounded, capable, profit-making and fun. M4 Sherman, PzIV, T-34, KV-1 (if you like slow heavies), ELC AMX, T49, M10 Wolverine, the list goes on. All good to great tanks that you will either keep when you move beyond them, or buy back later on and absolutely stuff with equipment and play for shits and giggles.<br /><br />Tier 5 is great. And it's all good from there on. Grinding doesn't get too seriously long until tier 7ish, and noticeably at tier 8.<br /><br />Side note: SPGs accumulate XP at a slower pace, and have higher XP requirements to transition up the tier levels, so if you play them, be prepared to spend a lot longer in each tier than you would in a tank.

              &quot; Arty is an interesting playstyle, but my first and only experience is the Bison atm and it's pretty brutal. That thing takes sooooooo long to zero in.&quot;<br /><br />Stick with it, once that crew is up to speed and you have some equipment on there (rammer, gld etc), the Bison is a mean mofo of an arty.  I'd advise you to run down the ruskie line to the su-26 as well for probably the most fun arty in the game. <br /><br />Btw, welcome, get on team speak, platoon with Arsians, have fun blowing shit up and you'll be raking in xp in no time.

Those two items can be expensive, but they're also freely transferable to any other tank unlike every other piece of equipment, so the credits won't be wasted when you sell the tank and move on.

              So I was finally able to play some more last night and actually managed to destroy a T1 for my first (and so far only) kill! That was my only kill out of about 6 battles I did. I also bought the T2 medium tank which seems to hit harder than the T1 I started with but I get paired up with much higher tier tanks when I play with the T2. Right now I'm just trying to grind out the stuff I need to buy a tier 3 tank and move on with the tutorial.<br /><br />I think right now my biggest issue is just paying attention and making sure no one is sneaking up behind me. I tend to try and stay with a group of tanks but the random battles rarely have anyone using the light tanks for actual scouting so many times an enemy tank will come out of nowhere and by the time the first shot hits I'm too far from cover to do anything.<br /><br />I got into a whack-a-mole type combat with a few tanks where I would pop out take a shot then roll back behind a rock and they would do the same until one of us was destroyed. Still having fun just wish I had more time to play.

Some equipment can be removed for free; most equipment cannot be removed unless you pay in game gold - which is arguably one of the best uses of gold.

When you first start are you are credit-starved for advancement.  Later you typically have credits (if not to burn then at least to easily cover your 'operating' costs) and are experience-starved.  My suggestion is to wait until you're at about tier5 and have a couple good credit-earners before you worry about consumables.<br />Without malice - you're probably not experienced enough yet for them to make much of a difference in your success.  <img src="//cdn.arstechnica.net/civis/images/smilies/smile.png" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">defiant107 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And as far as stuff like ventilation (at least I think that's what it's called), I'm switching tanks often enough right now that I don't think it's really worth it, but does it ever become worth it?

I know there are differences but most gear - like vents or rammers - are in the neighbourhood of 500k credits apiece and can only be dismounted for gold.

              Regarding consumables.<br />Repair, fire extinguisher, and first aid are only used on command.<br />High octane fuel is used each match, so is ridiculously expensive at low tiers.<br />Consumables are NOT destroyed unless used.<br />As these consumables typically cost 3000 credits or more, using them can eat up your profit margin and then some while running low tier.  Not using them and (maybe) losing the match verses using them and (maybe) winning the match can be a tough ROI calculation.  <br /><br />Regarding Equipment.<br />Equipment is not normally destroyed.  I do not think it impacts repair costs either, but I never bothered to test that theory.<br />Equipment can be moved from tank to tank, though except for binocs, camo net, and tool box, you have to pay 10 gold to dismount (complex equipment).  Not all equipment is compatible with all tanks.  Some tanks get tracked a lot.  If that tank has the option for a suspension upgrade, like 5ton torsion bars, adding that complex equipment will also enhance the durability of the tracks/suspension in terms of being able to take more damage before becoming &quot;tracked&quot;.<br /><br />For low tiers, as in 4 and below, it is pretty tough to justify much beyond a camo net, maybe a set of binos for a TD or Scout.  After Tier5 or 6, or as soon as you get into cannons that take 12 seconds or more to load, a gun rammer becomes a highly prized add on.  There are equipment sales periodically, where the equipment is at 1/2 price, that is the time to splurge on rammers, vents, etc.<br /><br />If you happen to be flush with cash, Vents, Rammer, Gun laying drive or Vertical Stabilizer are a pretty standard load out.  TDs may take Optics or Binocs.  Arty and TDs usually leave a spot for camo net regardless of what else they might want. Heavies almost always go for Rammer plus GLD or VS, third spot is usually the only one not heartily agreed on (from my observations) as the other two have an impact on how fast you can engage a target and cause damage.  Do Damage, get Credits.  No Damage, few credits (except for passive scouting).<br /><br />Once you have progressed past Tier 6 or 7, you may find that you just love driving certain lower tier tanks, that is the time to Pimp Your Ride with GLD, Rammer, and Vents ( or whatever is preferred for that tank and your preferences).

              A good way to make your credits go further is to realize that from time to time there are &quot;sales&quot; of 50% off selected tanks, usually tier 4 to tier 6 (sometimes seven).  It's a good way to save credits if you're patient.

              Seriously, fuck the T-43. The 100mm made it borderline playable. At least I've only got 20k xp left to the T-44, stuck using the peashooter 85mm.

No Damage, few credits (except for passive scouting).<br /><br /></div><br />Is this how XP and credits are decided after a battle? I wondered as it seems when I got a kill I didn't really get much more than the battle before it were I landed a few shots but didn't get any kills.<br /><br />I have managed to scout out some tanks and now when I use the T1 thats usually what I will do since most of the time my shots just bounce off the bigger tanks anyways. <br /><br />Is it better to focus on hitting as many tanks as possible so you have high damage or does destroying a tank even if you do less overall damage during the battle give more XP/Credits? Also does the type/tier of the tank play into the calculation? Sorry if this has all been answered before.

              Are these posts still valid for explaining different types of tanks and Nations?<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=22976025#p22976025">viewtopic.php?p=22976025#p22976025</a><!-- l --><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=22976230#p22976230">viewtopic.php?p=22976230#p22976230</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Also, I didn't worry much about equipment or consumables or buying training for my crew until I hit Tier 5 mediums and I started &quot;swimming&quot; in credits.<br /><br />As I mentioned last page the best RoI for your tank is getting the modules, like top turret, top gun etc.  The next best is getting your crew up to 100%, which is hard at lower tiers.  Then there's the equipment and consumables.<br /><br />I really didn't like using consumables until I got the Tier 5 medium tanks and then I would earn enough credits in a battle to buy 1 to 3 consumables and in 4 or 5 battles to buy training for the crew.<br /><br />The first equipment purchase was a camo net at 50,000 credits (which was half off).  Camo nets, Binoculars, and toolbox can be removed at will at no gold cost.  Everything else either costs gold or gets destroyed.<br /><br />I do recommend getting into channel with one of the more experienced folk.  Some of us maintain really low tier tanks because it's different than playing at high tier.<br /><br />Final note: When you're moving, plan to move from cover to cover or concealment.  If you're fired upon, take some pot shots, but goal 1 is to get to cover.  The new players tend to sit out in that open field to return fire and get slaughtered because they're sitting duck and not trying to move to cover.

We do use the occasional IS-4, but a Maus has more HP so if we have a good Maus driver we'll often take that.

Good view range too, and it occasionally bounces things, although the size is a bit of an issue. They are working well so far for us. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">socoj2 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Kestrel how do i get into some Clan wars action?</div><br /><br />Well, I play with the goons, so that has a requirement of :tenbux:, along with posting there for a while, etc. If you have a T10 tank and non-terrible stats however, there are numerous land holding clans that will take you. Some are really bad, some are decent. If you go down that route, only look at clans that are holding land in Europe, because they at least are competent enough to make a bit of gold. <br /><br />Really though, I'd recommend trying to organize ARS landing battles, and just getting used to CW. There should be enough ars players around to at least do landing battles a couple of times a week. You could also try talking to various clans to see if you can become their allies, and hold a landing zone for them. With the patch a while back that prevented land holding clans from applying to landing battles, landing zones are a huge risk. Having an ally hold that lets you relocate your chip stacks elsewhere, and so hold more land, push on more fronts, etc.
