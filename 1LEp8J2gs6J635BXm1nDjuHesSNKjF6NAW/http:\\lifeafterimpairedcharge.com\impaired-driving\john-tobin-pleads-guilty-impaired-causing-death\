This is why I’ll take my chances and try to fight my charge. If I’m found guilty, there’s no way I’ll be able to afford the insurance for 4 or 5 years anyway so I might as well try be one of the lucky ones that wins there case and fork out the money now.

It doesn’t matter if you can’t afford the insurance. If you were charged with a DUI you have to pay your dues.
Also, if you can’t afford the insurance take the bus the way I did when I was charged.

The problem with your argument is that after a first conviction, you are required to install an ignition interlock in your vehicle, which means the vehicle will not start if your blood alcohol level is over 0.02, well below the legal limit. Therefore, the actual risk to the insurance company (especially when you consider that if you are in an accident and impairment is involved, they won’t pay damages anyhow), is pretty low. Yet they are charging 6 times or more for insurance than if you did not have that impaired conviction.
