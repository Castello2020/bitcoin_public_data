                                            <p> <b>Diflucan Cost</b>, As I've written previously, in Ontario a new program came into effect earlier this year, where if your guilty plea was entered on or after August 3, 2010, you plead guilty within 90 days of the alcohol related driving charge, and your fines are all paid up, it is possible to apply for an early reinstatement of your license. In fact, <b>After Diflucan</b>, instead of waiting a full year, it might be possible to have it reinstated after three months.</p>
<p>It also must be your first offense, <b>order Diflucan no prescription</b>. As well, <b>Diflucan class</b>, you must have had at least the "Assessment" portion of the Back On Track Remedial program completed.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to work out the details, as now I am apparently eligible to apply to have my license reinstated, <b>canada, mexico, india</b>. But there are some problems:</p>
<p>First, I don't know if I'll even have a vehicle on the date I'll be able to get it back.  The vehicle I was driving was written off by the insurance company, and they estimated over $14,000.00 in damages, <b>Diflucan Cost</b>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I could afford insurance after the DUI or Impaired Driving conviction.  <b>Effects of Diflucan</b>, I'm still paying on a bank loan for the vehicle - because I was convicted of an alcohol related driving offense, my insurance company views that as a breach of contract and therefore they are not going to pay the bank the balance of what is owing.  I've got another 4 1/2 years to pay the loan off.</p>
<p>To be quite blunt, <b>order Diflucan online overnight delivery no prescription</b>, I am close to going bankrupt after all of the bills have come in, <b>Buy Diflucan from mexico</b>, the fine and restitution has been paid, and I've not been able to keep up with my other debts. My income has suffered dramatically since the accident and impaired driving charge, <b>where to buy Diflucan</b>.  <b>Diflucan Cost</b>, With no vehicle, it's been tough to get out there and call on clients and potential clients.</p>
<p>Having said that, <b>Diflucan trusted pharmacy reviews</b>, there are some possibilities. At this point, it is my understanding that now that I've completed the Back On Track assessment, <b>get Diflucan</b>, and my $1, <b>Diflucan dose</b>, 300.00 fine is paid in full, I should be able to call Guardian Interlock and get a contract with them. It seems to me that I don't actually have to have a vehicle to install the ignition interlock in, <b>online buying Diflucan hcl</b>, but I do need to provide proof of a contract with the company for one of their interlock devices.  <b>Kjøpe Diflucan på nett, köpa Diflucan online</b>, Then, I can apply for my licence back, and when it is returned to me, <b>Diflucan overnight</b>, it will have an "I" on it, <b>Buy cheap Diflucan no rx</b>, which means I am not to drive any vehicle that does not have an ignition interlock installed.  But at least I could have my license back, which would give me some options going forward, <b>Diflucan Cost</b>.</p>
<p>My vehicle is at the premises of what I'm told a pretty good auto body mechanic. There is some possibility he could fix up my vehicle for a lot less than what the insurance company estimated the damages to be - but it's still going to be a hefty price to pay in my present financial situation.  But at least I'd have a vehicle that I wouldn't feel so bad about making payments on.</p>
<p>If my financial situation improves, and I can then also afford the vehicle insurance, I'd have a vehicle to drive when that happens.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'm hoping to give Guardian Interlock a call to see what they have to say about getting a contract and what that entails.</p>
<p>I'll post more as I learn more.</p>
<p>All this could have been avoided if I had my own <a href="http://lifeafterimpairedcharge.com/breathalyzer" target="_blank">personal breathalyzer</a>. It would have been a much smaller price to pay than what I have paid after getting behind the wheel and thinking I was fine to drive.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that you do not need to get an interlock installed into your or any vehicle, unless you plan on driving within the one year period.  Guardian interlock is optional and not required if you take an additional year of not driving, being two years total.  This is in Ontario, not sure if it the same everywhere.</p>

<p>Thanks, Audrey. You are correct that you do not need to get it installed if you are not going to drive. But if you do want to drive, you do need to get it installed.</p>

<p>I have been diligently reading all of your blogs this week&#8230; and I sure understand everything you are saying.  I was sentenced last Monday&#8230;( $15000 lawyer&#8230;. and that did nothing for me).  The shame, embarrassment, self-esteem, and &#8220;loser&#8221; feeling sure are not fun!!  And certainly the financial toll it has cost..and WILL cost.  My fine was $2000..and I also just registered for Back on Track.  My question..(it&#8217;s driving me nuts)&#8230; Is my court order said 6 months notwithstanding I register for the interlock program&#8230;. BUT today I got the &#8220;registered letter&#8221;&#8230;from the Ministry of transportation&#8230;and it states I am &#8220;suspended for one year AND 6 months!!!  Your one blog gave me hope&#8230;that I will also get that &#8220;second&#8221; letter that you got&#8230;about applying for the reduced suspension&#8230;. maybe it is just a day later than the registered one??  Can you please let me know &#8230;.. I am sooo hoping&#8230; After the 90 day initial suspension (it happened in Oct. 2009)..and driving for a year , before the trial&#8230;the confidence was building&#8230;.only to get kicked right down to ground zero again.  It really sucks!!  We all learn our lessons&#8230;I have not had one drop to drink in 15 months&#8230;and never plan to again.<br />
You can even email me address above if you&#8217;d like.  Thanks &#8230; L.</p>

<p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>I was just wondering what you ment by your court order stating 6 months notwithstanding.  Did the courts say that you would be suspended for 1 year and 1 year interlock and then the Ministry said something else (1 year and 6 months). Just wondering how come you got 1 year and 6 months and not the 1 year. I&#8217;m a bit suspicious about this reduced program and the real intentions by the Ministry. Let me know.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
Mike</p>

<p>Hey Christie,<br />
Sorry I&#8217;m late with my response but I hope it helps. Also, I hope your court date went well on the 9th.<br />
I just wanted to let you know that I was pulled over and charged for drunk driving on November 5, 2010. On December 16th, 2011, I plead guilty, got a $1250 fine, a one year license suspension with the possibilty of reduced sentencing providing that I installed an Ignition Interlock Device and I must enter and complete the Remidial Measures Program which costs $578. A friend of mine was charged in August, 2010 and retained a lawyer whom he paid $2500 for and wound up with the same sentening. They were both for a first offense.<br />
I have heard of people &#8220;getting off&#8221; for a first offense so I don&#8217;t want to advise you againt having a lawyer, but please do make sure to talk to your lawyer and ensure that they don&#8217;t make you think you&#8217;re getting a deal if this is what they&#8217;re offering you.<br />
I also wanted to let you know that I just received a letter in the mail and was made aware of something that I did not know about, I have a 1 year license suspension, and an ADDITIONAL year once my license is reinstated with a condition on it stating that if I am driving I must drive a vehicle equiped with an Ignition Interlock Device. I did not know this, I thought it was optional to have one installed, and if I chose not to, after 1 year I would have my full license back.<br />
It is infact optional, but if you choose not to have one installed, you wind up not being able to drive for a total of TWO YEARS not just one! I wish I knew this sooner as I would have enrolled in the Remedial Measures program sooner and had the device installed within 3 months so that I could potentially have my full license back within a year. I now have missed that deadline and at best will have the condition on my license for an additional 6 months. So I will not have a full license until at least May, 2012, whereas if I knew this sooner, I would have potentially had the condition removed and my full license back by December, 2011.<br />
I hope this gives you some insight on what to expect if you are indeed found guilty, and please do give an update on how your lawyer is handling the situation!</p>

<p>Hey Christie,  I know exactly what your going through as I was pulled over on April 23.2011. I&#8217;ve been sick to my stomach ever since this happened. The worst part about my situatiion is that I was actually trying to do the responsible thing. I slept over at a friends house, had to go to bathroom in the morning to discover he had no toilette paper!!! I just chalked it up to being a little tired and said screw it, I&#8217;m going home. On my drive home I felt a little sick and coughed up some bile, spit it out my door and the cop saw this and pulled me over. Ever since my life has been up side down. I guess we have to look at the positive and say &#8220;at least we didn&#8217;t hurt anybody&#8221;. I&#8217;ve learned to realize that as much of a pain in the ass this is, and the financial greif it&#8217;s put me through, somebody else always has it worse. I&#8217;m at the point now where I do have a &#8220;okay day&#8221; here and there. All we can do is take it one day at a time. Good luck hope you feel better.</p>

<p>Hello<br />
I&#8217;m hoping to get some answers here&#8230;been reading alot of different info. I was charged 3 yrs ago July with Impaired driving. I never signed up for the BOT program due to financial reasons but am now looking into it. Since my charge was a few yrs ago, would I have to go through all the G1 and stuff? or can I just get my license bacl after doing this course? I don&#8217;t plan on driving, as I have no vehicle but would just like to get my llicense back for the sake of having it back. I have contacted the John Howard society as well with some questions regarding my situation.</p>

<p>Hi Marsha,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment and your question. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have the answer to whether or not you would have to go through the graduated license program or not, after three years. Your best bet would probably to call the MOT and ask them directly.</p>
<p>Good luck to you!</p>

<p>I was charged with care and control in March 2008 I was suspended and plead guilty 1 year to the day at the advice of an exspensive lawyer who really did nothing for me&#8230;That is all moot now anyway! My question is&#8230; I have now been suspended for 2.5 years, I took the extra year so I didn&#8217;t have to get the interlock device&#8230; I haven&#8217;t done the back on track program&#8230; Is there anyway of getting my liscence back without doing it? or getting it back now and still doing the course?</p>
<p>Jason.</p>

<p>Jason,  you will need to do the Back On Track program before you can apply for the reinstatement of your license.</p>

<p>I was charged with a dui may 6, 2011. I got myself a good lawyer who has gone to court for me twice.. I have some questions regarding this whole process. So as of august 6th it will be three months since my license was suspended and I was told that mto would be sending me something in the mail about getting a temporary driving license a week prior to this whIich would be in two weeks from now. I am pleading not guilty.. and will explain later why. In order to have my license reinstated after the 3 months that means I am able to drive up until my court date which isnt until next april right ? I do not have to complete the remedial measures program or am i wrong ? I have not completed this course or even signed up for it as I was told that I do no not need to unless I plan on pleading guilty. Someone educate me on this as Im very confused at this point and just hope that when august 6th comes which is very soon I can go into an mto office and have my license reinstated of course after paying the $150 fine.. by the way it was also the worst night of my life. If I am found guilty I will have to take the program, and put the ignition interlock device on my car after having my license suspended for another 6 months ? someone elaborate and just answer some questions for me. Feel free to email me at anytime. I would very much appreciate it.</p>

<p>I was told to sign up for back on track after my year of suspenstion was up, which was the end of March. I am about to register for the program now but I have JUST been told if i waited to long I would have to wait another whole year without driving. I though back on track was a weekend long and I could apply for my lisence right after the weekend. Please tell me this is wrong and I can sign up for back on track Tomorrow and get my lisence back this month?</p>

<p>No one has answered your questions.  I don&#8217;t have the answer either.  Surely someone out there has been through this process and can answer your questions.</p>

<p>This is very therapeutic. A quick overview of my situation. I was arrested in March 2011. Charged with impaired and over 80mg. I was not speeding, and broke no traffic laws. The officer claims he saw me &#8220;driving erratically in a parking lot in my white van&#8221; (my van is, in fact, black). He arrested me and did not read me my chapter 11 rights. He did not explain my right to counsel at the station. His notes verify this. They kept me in a cell for nearly 3 hours at the station and then breath tested me. I blew a 210 and 225. I was lucid, not stumbling or slurring words. I am not an alcoholic. Functioning or otherwise. I run a successful carpentry business, have a wife, mortgage, and two classic cars. I am a productive member of society. Clearly this machine is malfunctioning. Due the unconstitutional structure of Ontario&#8217;s impaired driving laws, I cannot effectively argue the machine.</p>
<p>I hired a very good and reputable DUI law firm and my case was handled by a senior partner. To the tune of $8000. He was enthusiastic about the officers blatant misconduct and felt we had a strong case. During my trial the crown attorney was disorganized, ill prepared and frankly quite condescending and rude to me during my testimony. Constantly &#8220;suggesting&#8221; that everything the officer stated was true and that I was simply far too drunk to remember anything. Her approach was laughable at best. Perhaps it works on terrified young adults, but not a confident successful adult male. I left the trials second day of submissions with a shit eating grin. My lawyer was doing a fantastic job, and the Judge was almost making our argument for us. Another day of submissions and a decision was scheduled for two months later. Again, I felt confident. On this day, yet again, another date was scheduled for the actual judgement.</p>
<p>That day was today. Dec 3rd 2012. I was found guilty and convicted. On both the impaired and over 80mg.  I felt like I had been hit with a sledgehammer. Hard. My business is a product of my own grit and hard work. I have no employees. If I cant drive, I&#8217;m essentially out of business. Judge gave me a 15 month suspension, but stated  that I could participate in the BOT program. I have just registered. Who&#8217;s decision is it to determine when I get the interlock installed? Or, I guess a better way to put it is what&#8217;s the least amount of time I have to go without driving?</p>

<p>Wow, Chris &#8211; your story is another one of those that seem to show some of the injustices in the system. This was your first offense and you received a 15 month suspension? </p>
<p>You wrote &#8220;but stated that I could participate in the BOT program.&#8221; Actually, you HAVE to participate in the Back On Track program and if I were you, I would be contacting them today to get registered for it. You cannot get your license back without having gone through it, and it can take awhile depending on where you are and the number of people in your area that have to go through it. So make that a priority.</p>
<p>If you participate in the program, the Judge may have let you participate in the &#8220;fast track&#8221; program, which means if you have an interlock installed in your vehicle, you could possibly get your license back in six months after the date of conviction. You will have to look into that.</p>

<p>Yeah, The judge gave me the 15 month on my first offense because of the high readings. I was drinking that evening, but was pacing about 1 beer an hour. Maybe a little less. No way the readings should have been 210 and 225. I should have been falling down drunk. Furthermore, half the video evidence of the breath sample was lost with no explanation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already registered for the BOT program. If I could make it back on the road in 6 months, it may not be that bad. </p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>

<p>Hey Chris</p>
<p>Does the 6 months you are talking about include the 90 days suspension. I was charged last month, first charge let alone first incounter with the law (aside from a speeding ticket) my reading was high (did not eat alot that day) and my court date is in January. I think I could last 6 months with no liscense but a full year I would potentially lose my job. Any advise on what I should say at court, I can not afford a lawyer so pleading guilty with hopes of suspension being 6 months. Thanks</p>

<p>I am not condoning what I did, I know it was wrong but I feel the punishment is very harsh as it was victemless. I will never drink and drive again but the overall ramifications can lead some people down a wrong path. I am lucky to have friends who give me a ride and have money saved I could not imagine going through this if I had a low income and no one around. I am nervouse about the court date as I will have no representation, as a fist time offense, clean record, but high BAC  what do you think the outcome will be??</p>

<p>Hey Everyone&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m going to answer some of your questions as my family has gone through this since Sept. 8/2008. I personally did not get caught but my husband did and have gone through hell and back with lawyers/ministery&#8217;s and even the BOT ALL having different answers for the same damn questions its been CrAzY and a nightmare. On a personal level reading so much complaints due to these Ignition Interlock Devices and leaving people stranded and making you pull over 3 times in an hour long drive, someone is going to get killed due to these machines as pulling over on a highway is dangerous enough with trucks and cars passing by and the thought of us actually putting one in (yes we just got his license back today) and my son and I driving and it locking me out and leaving us stranded does not sit well with me as I don&#8217;t drink and if that were to happen you can bet I would make damn good and sure that the Ministry and News and whoever else knew about it and sue there behinds off for it.<br />
Now getting back to some questions my husband was caught with drinking and driving and stunt driving as they claimed he was doing over 150k. We had a crappy lawyer that just kept coming to court complaining about his life and doing nothing after spending well over $17,000.00 needless to say he was fired in the end as my husband just wanted it over so he took care of it himself, as he said &#8220;I&#8217;m guilty just give me what I deserve&#8221; so he went in and got 18 months suspended license, a $2500.00 dollar fine for DUI and $800.00 for stunt driving = in total about $20,000.00 and we are still going&#8230;sooo he was told by his lawyer to go to this BOT and he did before court was over then we found out that the weekend he wasted there was NOT the one he needed so he had to re-book another one and found out that costs $563.00 and another weekend spend in a tiny room for nothing as we found out if he did not take the BOT he would not get his license back this was just in 2013&#8230;so he called BOT 6 months later as you have to have an interview and then they called a month after to ask some questions and then said he passed the questions (yes you can fail the questions then you don&#8217;t get your license back) and he could go get his license back without their permission you can&#8217;t. The Ministry sent him a letter saying he could take his G1 all over again but what they don&#8217;t tell you is it also cost&#8217;s another $140.00 and if you happen to fail and you MIGHT especially if you have had your license for over 30 years it costs $15.00 each time you fail but you can book your G2 right away and get your license right away BUT what they don&#8217;t tell you is you have to have a vehicle that already has a Ignition Interlock Device in it in order for you to even take your G2 road test and you CAN NOT do it without one and if you plan on waiting another year like we do so you do not have to put one of these things that is a hazard (as far as I&#8217;m concerned) in, you can rent a car that has it and the cost of it is around $550-$600 which in turn gives you a total to almost $26,000.00. Now do not get me wrong I do not agree with drinking and driving and we both agree it was a blessing in disguise but what these people fail to tell you anything. When he went to do his G1 they told us at one Ministry all he had to do was an eye test when we got to the Ministry that handles this then we found out after we drove there that it cost the $140 and we also found out which of course we did not have on us that he had to have 2 picture ID&#8217;s which meant we had to drive ALL the way back home then back again that their discourages ANYONE who has already lost their license from even wanting to get it as this just makes you feel even worse. Drinking and driving is bad and I don&#8217;t condone it BUT we ALL make mistakes even the Judges and Lawyers who pass judgement (some drink and drive they just don&#8217;t get caught) on these people who get caught but these sentences for this is a bit over rated especially when it&#8217;s your first time for ANYTHING in a Court of Law&#8230;so just be prepared that their is hidden costs that you could end up paying for&#8230;</p>

<p>sorry forgot you also have to phone the BOT within a year of your suspension or you have to wait another year and after you go to the BOT you have to wait 6 months and that&#8217;s when they call and interview you on the phone &#8230;sorry didn&#8217;t make it clearer earlier&#8230;xo</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>This is Chris that posted way back on june 3rd. Not the chris that was convicted with the construction business. </p>
<p>Anyway, A follow up to my case. I was charged back in April of 2011. I did retain a lawyer and my charges were stayed. Even though I got off, and am very thankful for it, I still think there must be alternatives to combating this. I can tell you that, this sentence can almost ruin someone&#8217;s life. I understand the government needs to take a strong stance on the issue, but there are times I feel the penalty is too severe. There are people out there committing offences with intent and knowledge they are breaking the law, but there lively hood is not effected to the degree of an impaired conviction. Part of the problem is the government doesn&#8217;t take in account that after go the penalty that they feel is justified, your still screwed because your insurance might not be affordable. I was in a position where if I lost, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have been able to drive for way more than the one year suspension and all that. My charges were stayed in june of 2012, and as lucky as I feel to have got off, financially this has still killed me. My total legal expenses were about 10,000. When your only making 30Gs a year before tax&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a killer.</p>
<p>Anyone who is thinking about getting a lawyer, you have to be EXTREMELY  carful about who you retain. Most will look at your documents and tell you that you have shot. 80% of the time, it&#8217;s BS. over 80/impaired are very tough to beat. There is really only one guy in the city that can get you a legit shot at getting off and will tell you right off the hop what your chances are. Depending on what  you blow and where your trial is, he&#8217;ll know right away if your should plead guilty and save your money or roll the dice. If he thinks you have a shot, it will cost you about 10Gs.  If  your in this situation and thinking about fighting it, his name is fred fedorsen and adam little.</p>
