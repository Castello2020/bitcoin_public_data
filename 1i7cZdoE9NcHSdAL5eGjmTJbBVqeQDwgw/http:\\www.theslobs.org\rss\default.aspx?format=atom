&lt;p&gt;We are in the midst of the largest invasion on our borders than we have ever seen in this country. We have masses of children, adults, and gang members arriving at our borders every day. This is seemingly a problem that the California ruling elite and Washington DC ruling elite are unprepared to solve.  As far back as January of 2014 we know that the Administration (DHS) was asking people to apply for jobs as &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4W2PmfPapvEUHFiUm95OFIyb0k/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;escorts&lt;/a&gt; for the illegal minors coming to our shores. We have all seen the protests happening across the country on the news but what they aren’t telling you is why the communities are protesting beyond the fact that the Administration and the people coming here are illegal aliens. And yes Mr. President we are a Nation of immigrants but we are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEGAL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; immigrants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So take Murrieta for instance, this is a small community in the southwestern part of Riverside County in California. This is not the hot bed of activity for anything. Until 1991 it wasn’t even considered a city as the population didn’t meet the requirements for “city” status until then. They now have a municipal fire department but that didn’t occur until 1987 before this date they had  a volunteer fire department. Murrieta also boasts a fairly new police department originated in 1992 with 100 officers filling its ranks. And to service the health care needs of this small community are two hospitals. Just so you understand Murrieta was considered the safest city in the country of its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you lived in a little hamlet such as this and heard that your population was going to increase with a huge incursion of people here illegally what would you do? You would try to protect the small slice of freedom that you have wouldn’t you? Well Murrieta and other communities are doing just that. They can’t believe the federal government is trying to overwhelm their town resources with people who came here illegally and of whom they have no identity. As we have no demographics of who is coming over the borders we have no idea who the government is trying to release into our communities. The DHS seems unable to answer cursory questions reading the identities of these folks except to say they are children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting reports from others that the groups of “children” also include gang members and others that have or will likely &lt;a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/07/16/Exclusive-Released-Alien-from-Border-Crisis-Arrested-For-Alleged-Murder-Kidnapping-in-Texas"&gt;commit crimes&lt;/a&gt; in our country. As the California legislature seem to be absent from this discussion we ask the people to contact their representatives and ask them what they are doing to solve this problem. We know there are communicable diseases within the populations of aliens coming here, that will spread like wild fire through our communities if left unchecked. We also realize that the United States taxpayer is paying the bill for all of these people and their potential stays at 3 star hotels being set up around the country. At a time when we are exposing how poorly our own Veterans are treated we see illegal aliens getting preferential treatment that is unknown by our own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer this situation is allowed to fester the worse it will get and there seems to be no leadership from the Ivory Tower of the White House. &lt;a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/07/17/poll-majority-disapprove-of-obama-handling-of-border-crisis-n1863082"&gt;Polling&lt;/a&gt; numbers for the President keep plummeting as he continues to ignore this debacle. In the mean time we have communities of taxpayers who are trying their best to protect the sanctity of their towns and homes. And no one is calling out the progressives for using these kids as human shields for more failed liberal policies. And Yes Mr. President you did indeed build this mess!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/bloggerinchiefblog.wordpress.com/33/"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/bloggerinchiefblog.wordpress.com/33/" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=bloggerinchiefblog.com&amp;#038;blog=64408483&amp;#038;post=33&amp;#038;subd=bloggerinchiefblog&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /&gt;</content><rights type="text">Copyright 7/17/2014 11:05:21 AM</rights><thumbnail url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovL2Jsb2dnZXJpbmNoaWVmYmxvZy5maWxlcy53b3JkcHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMTQvMDcvbm8tZW50cmFyLmpwZ3wyMDV8MTUw0&amp;crp=true" height="205" width="150" format="square" xmlns="" /><mainImage url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovL2Jsb2dnZXJpbmNoaWVmYmxvZy5maWxlcy53b3JkcHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMTQvMDcvbm8tZW50cmFyLmpwZ3wzMTB8MTUw0&amp;crp=true" height="150" width="310" format="wide" xmlns="" /><image xmlns="">http://bloggerinchiefblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/no-entrar.jpg?w=500</image><image xmlns="">http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=bloggerinchiefblog.com&amp;#038;blog=64408483&amp;#038;post=33&amp;#038;subd=bloggerinchiefblog&amp;#038;ref=&amp;#038;feed=1</image></entry><entry><id>blogger in chief blog</id><title type="text">IMPORTANT MESSAGING RE: CA GOP  28% by Marc Harris ( Guest blogger)</title><summary type="html">&amp;nbsp;Last Thursday, at the John &amp;amp; Ken KFI AM640 gubernatorial debate between GOP favoriteNeel Kashkariand the true conservative, AssemblymanTim Donnelly, Kashkari quoted a statistic that the clueless GOP leaders continue to quote in explaining why they are moving further and further to the left politically, to the extent that now they are looking almost indistinguishable from the Democrats on most issues.Debate highlights:&lt;a[...]</summary><published>2014-05-29T15:59:21-07:00</published><updated>2014-05-29T16:00:11-07:00</updated><author><name>Dawn Wildman</name><uri>http://bloggerinchiefblog.com/2014/05/29/important-messaging-re-ca-gop-28-by-marc-harris-guest-blogger/</uri></author><contributor><name>Dawn Wildman</name><uri>http://bloggerinchiefblog.com/2014/05/29/important-messaging-re-ca-gop-28-by-marc-harris-guest-blogger/</uri></contributor><link rel="alternate" href="http://bloggerinchiefblog.com/2014/05/29/important-messaging-re-ca-gop-28-by-marc-harris-guest-blogger/" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="IMPORTANT MESSAGING RE: CA GOP  28% by Marc Harris ( Guest blogger)" length="67" href="http://bloggerinchiefblog.com/2014/05/29/important-messaging-re-ca-gop-28-by-marc-harris-guest-blogger/" /><category term="CA Politics" /><category term="Tea Party" /><category term="CAGOP" /><category term="California" /><category term="GOP" /><category term="Kashkari" /><category term="Neel Kashkari" /><category term="Republican Party" /><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bloggerinchiefblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/gop-logo-upside-down.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31" src="http://bloggerinchiefblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/gop-logo-upside-down.jpg?w=500" alt="GOP logo upside down"   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday, at the John &amp;amp; Ken KFI AM640 gubernatorial debate between GOP favorite &lt;strong&gt;Neel Kashkari&lt;/strong&gt; and the true conservative, Assemblyman &lt;strong&gt;Tim Donnelly&lt;/strong&gt;, Kashkari quoted a statistic that the clueless GOP leaders continue to quote in explaining why they are moving further and further to the left politically, to the extent that now they are looking almost indistinguishable from the Democrats on most issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debate highlights: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aan4gmAQ3MM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aan4gmAQ3MM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kashkari and the GOP say the percentage of registered Republicans in CA has fallen to &amp;#8220;just 28%&amp;#8221;; a stat they quickly follow up by stating that &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;we need to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;grow our party!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;.  Well, I have just a couple of questions for them&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where did all those Republicans go that used to be registered?  Did they just up and leave the state?!! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.  While some have, in fact, left California, the majority of them have all just been switching to &lt;strong&gt;Independent, Libertarian,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Decline To State&lt;/strong&gt;.   Nearly half of the former percentage of Republicans in CA have done so, and Inquiring minds&amp;#8211;clearly &lt;em&gt;absent&lt;/em&gt; from the blind and deaf elitists making up the GOP shot callers&amp;#8211;want to know &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;WHY??&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is because of the very reaction by those clueless GOP &amp;#8220;leaders&amp;#8221; in response to the dismal party attrition rates: keep moving further to the left with candidates like Kashkari &amp;#8220;in order to &amp;#8220;appeal&amp;#8221; to more liberal voters!   (sound of phonograph record scratching) What??!!   Ok, ok; wait.  Let&amp;#8217;s go a little slower for them here:&amp;#8230;.soooooo,  the party is shrinking because it has been moving too far to the left&amp;#8230;.sooooo,  your &amp;#8216;solution&amp;#8217; is&amp;#8230;.to move it &lt;em&gt;FARTHER TO THE LEFT&lt;/em&gt;!!!  Brilliant!!   What was Einstein&amp;#8217;s definition of insanity?  That&amp;#8217;s right: doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A five-year old can figure out that as you respond by moving further to the left, more and more conservative Republicans will continue to leave the Party, an exodus that will dwindle the GOP down to a very small minority of those who have essentially morphed so completely into Democrats they may as well complete the transformation and just &lt;em&gt;put a &amp;#8220;D&amp;#8221; after their names&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks, the Republicans didn&amp;#8217;t shrink to 28% by standing on conservative principles, but by &lt;em&gt;abandoning&lt;/em&gt; them.  And there can be ONLY two ways to go from the ditch the GOP elitists have driven it into: move further left, or quickly, firmly, and UNASHAMEDLY &lt;em&gt;RUN&lt;/em&gt; back to the right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so sick of GOP leaders acting weak, apologetic, and even squeamish in taking a stand on anything related to the Constitution, pro-business, free- market capitalism, pro 2nd Amendment and the right to protect yourself, for securing the borders, and against the extremist environmentalist agenda that is bankrupting our state and nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are at a crossroads, fellow Californians&amp;#8211;and fellow Americans; for &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;as goes California, so goes the nation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;.  With all the strength and resources we can muster, we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; wrest the wheel from the foolish, clueless GOP leadership that, in quoting the 28% figure, has effectively conceded one irrefutable truth: &lt;em&gt;THEY blew it&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, their endorsement of Neel Kashkari for Governor, the epitome of a RINO (Kashkari voted for Obama, and lionized him as &amp;#8220;a partisan warrior&amp;#8221; who he believed could fix the US economy; he was at the Treasury Department during the mortgage meltdown, and then voted for TARP to try to fix the meltdown), only demonstrates that they cannot be trusted to fix the damage they have caused, and that they only intend to drive the party deeper into the liberal abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must say &amp;#8220;NO MORE!&amp;#8221;, and stand &lt;em&gt;AGAINST&lt;/em&gt; them, and &lt;em&gt;FOR&lt;/em&gt; the true constitutional conservative, &lt;strong&gt;Tim Donnelly&lt;/strong&gt;.  Heaven help us all if he doesn&amp;#8217;t win.  We will all have to follow Toyota and others and move to Texas&amp;#8211;and come back and pick up the pieces in 20 years after the fuzzy-headed liberals in &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; parties have turned California into Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

Where credit cards were created for the pre-internet world and require account information to be traded, bitcoin is like cash. You pay someone Bitcoin, not your bitcoin account information. This is why bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This provides a lot of public good. People can buy from anywhere in the world without bank imposed fees or the worry that an unknown foreign company will steal their credit card information. Bitcoin users are also immune to things like bank account freezes or non-sufficient fund charges. Each bitcoin user has their own independent encrypted wallet. When combined with a long, strong pass-phrase (passwords are too short for effective security), bitcoin in a users wallet are more secure than money held in a bank account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government frowns upon bitcoin. Many governments oppose it, but not because bitcoin is evil. Governments use various rationalizations that boil down to the governments greed for power to control money. Bitcoin is money backed by mathematics, not governments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bitcoin is created in limited quantities, so it cannot be printed and artificially inflated. There is a fixed total amount of Bitcoin. Bitcoin must be "mined" which means computer algorithms reward people for cracking codes. The codes become harder the more computing power is thrown at bitcoin, so no one can make all the Bitcoin. There is also an element of randomness to ensure that little guys have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When laws are used against the public good, or to empower the powerful, we nerds call this "lawful evil". Slavery, fascism, communism are all examples of the law being used to enrich some at the expense of others. All governments are prone to the temptations of "lawful evil" because government is the concentration of power. Government can be looked at as the monopoly of the use of force. Which is why George Washington explained, "Government is not reason; it is not eloquent; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The War on Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;The government really has no bigger role in the technology of bitcoin than it would in some foreign currency. As a matter of fact, we sometimes forget that the power to "regulate" was intended to promote trade by making it "more regular." &amp;nbsp;Bitcoin is self-regulating, it can't be stolen, hacked, monopolized or counterfeited. It is just a new currency of trade designed for the internet. Not only is there no need for government regulation of bitcoin, intervention doesn't serve the public good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the most powerful government in the world, The U.S. Government, has crafted a Machiavellian strategy to stop bitcoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the earliest adopters of bitcoin were people trading drugs and other illegal items on a website called &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/21/fbi-cracks-silk-road/2984921/" target="_blank"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;, so the U.S. Government shut down the website. They seized 29,656 Bitcoin from the accounts users stored on the Silk Road servers (not held in their personal encrypted wallets). In the beginning, Bitcoin were only worth a few dollars, so this really wasn't much money. The operator of the site accumulated 144,000 Bitcoin through fees. These coins were also seized but were held in a secure wallet that the government could not access. The U.S. Marshals took the &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2806mx/why_are_the_silk_road_coins_being_auctioned_if/" target="_blank"&gt;29,656&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;bitcoin from the website's servers and the FBI took the 144,000 Bitcoin wallet from the proprietor, Ross Ulbricht aka “Dread Pirate Roberts".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are not condoning illegal activity, but Bitcoin wasn't the problem with silk road. The U.S. Dollar is the actual currency of the drug trade and illegal activity. But, the U.S. government learned that Bitcoin was a threat to their income stream because they couldn't just seize cash and bank accounts. Instead they held an encrypted wallet they couldn't crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/04/economist-explains-7" target="_blank"&gt;Civil Asset Forfeiture&lt;/a&gt; Law allows government agencies that seizes assets to then charge the assets with a crime and sell or use those assets themselves. Most Civil Asset Forfeitures are not associated with a criminal case. As a matter of fact, if you carry $10,000 in cash, it must be declared or it can just be seized. Unlike normal due process, you must then prove that the money is yours and how you earned it. There is no presumption of innocence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;"Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, found that 80% of people whose property was seized by the federal government were never charged with a crime. Forfeiture proceedings are brought not against people, but against property that law enforcement need only allege is connected to criminal activity."&lt;/blockquote&gt;When the government seized Bitcoin from Silk Road, some of the coins were being traded for legitimate goods, but it would be impossible for someone to fight on behalf of their Bitcoin as the Bitcoin would themselves be charged with money laundering due to the Silk Road system through Civil Asset Forfeiture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, because Bitcoin is now seen as a threat to the revenue stream of the government a strategy appears to have been developed to suppress the revolutionary technology. &amp;nbsp;The U.S. Government doesn't see Bitcoin as a threat to the dollar because the price of bitcoin would have to be above $4,600 to allow $1 trillion in transactions value to take place globally. At $500-600, bitcoin is just a nuisance for law enforcement asset seizures. So, the anti-bitcoin strategy appears to be aimed at minimizing this strategy by suppressing the price of bitcoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this price suppression in mind, the first step is to declare the new currency a "capital or non-capital asset" or property through &lt;a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/11942/bitcoin-tax-understanding-irs-notice-2014-21/" target="_blank"&gt;IRS Notice 2014-21&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Without this declaration, bitcoin would be reported as cash, and companies using bitcoin could trade dollars and Bitcoin and report them on the same part of the balance sheets to investors. By the IRS declaring it a capital asset, bitcoin focused companies will show weaker cash and current ratios than non-bitcoin companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bitcoin companies would have to be big for cash ratios to matter, but Bitcoin seized by law enforcement also allows for a broader attack on the new cryptocurrency. Every company holding Bitcoin will show less assets if the price falls. This could affect their ability to get loans or new investors. So, today June 27th, 2014 is the first run at dumping thousands of bitcoin on the market at the end of a reporting period. The U.S. Marshals timed their &lt;a href="http://www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2014/bitcoins/" target="_blank"&gt;29,656 bitcoin auction&lt;/a&gt; to coincide with the end of the 2nd quarter for reporting purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auction will sell Bitcoin in blocks of 3,000 and requires a $200,000 deposit. This will keep small investors out of the auction and ensure that companies with reporting requirements, public or private, buy the coins. These companies will then have to sell a portion of the coins within the next three days, June 30th, or show a hit to their cash balances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bitcoin sold at discount at auction will then in-turn drive down the market price due to the immediate sales. This reduces the capital assets of every other company with Bitcoin that reports on June 30th as the end of the second fiscal quarter. (Most corporations use year end as their fiscal year end.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hit to bitcoin related companies will discourage additional investment, make financing more difficult and allow for the lapdog media to push a narrative headline that bitcoin is failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this strategy works, the remaining 144,000 FBI seized Bitcoin will follow the same strategy. They would be auctioned in blocks just before the end of the next several fiscal quarters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The government eventually was given access to the seized Bitcoin after convincing the Silk Road proprietor that they were going to crash the price and that he needed to cash out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A New Hope&lt;/h3&gt;There is one hitch in this strategy. Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency. The second leading currency is called &lt;a href="https://litecoin.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Litecoin&lt;/a&gt;. It is newer than bitcoin, transactions are faster, there are more coins, the coins are still only around $10 and the coins are more easily mined by small players due to a newer algorithm called "scrypt." Many exchanges allow for Bitcoin to be directly traded for Litecoin, so companies with Bitcoin can move to Litecoin instead of suffering losses to their balance sheets during the Auctions/dumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ityK__abaYE/U61xCocMnzI/AAAAAAAAClA/3NVIjIZ4mJ4/s1600/MoveToLiteCoin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ityK__abaYE/U61xCocMnzI/AAAAAAAAClA/3NVIjIZ4mJ4/s1600/MoveToLiteCoin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="#MoveToLiteCoin" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ityK__abaYE/U61xCocMnzI/AAAAAAAAClA/3NVIjIZ4mJ4/s1600/MoveToLiteCoin.jpg" height="206" title="Move To Litecoin" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to this flaw in the anti-bitcoin strategy, government agents have had to contend with the &lt;a href="http://blog.doodooecon.com/2014/06/movetolitecoin-defundthefeds-response.html" target="_blank"&gt;#MoveToLiteCoin&lt;/a&gt; movement. They primarily must resort to insults and personal attacks otherwise known as FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) on proponents of #MoveToLiteCoin to discourage others from joining the movement. In the end, they don't have enough seized LiteCoin to suppress the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after our first report on #MoveToLiteCoin, someone traded 1600 Bitcoin for Litecoin. Last night nearly 100,000 of these were dumped on the market with almost no effect. If this was the government's attempt at stopping Litecoin in order to further their anti-bitcoin strategy, the U.S. Government can't stop Bitcoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We expect to see Bitcoin prices to fall through June 30th and Litecoin prices to rise. After the U.S. Marshals Bitcoin dump is over the media will run press release driven stories on "Bitcoin's crash." Review both Bitcoin and Litecoin prices to prove that Bitcoin is just too flexible to stop due to its alternative cryptocurrency partners. Even if Bitcoin prices fall, watch as Bitcoin quickly rebounds as investors return from their #MoveToLiteCoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><rights type="text">Copyright 6/27/2014 7:22:00 AM</rights><thumbnail url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovLzMuYnAuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLy1SdEpiZXl5Q1dUNC9VdVF1QXpNM0ZhSS9BQUFBQUFBQUNpMC9vUm95aWdVM0RNMC9zMTYwMC9CaXRjb2luMkVXVC0yNTYucG5nfDIwNXwxNTA1&amp;crp=true" height="205" width="150" format="square" xmlns="" /><mainImage url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovLzMuYnAuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLy1SdEpiZXl5Q1dUNC9VdVF1QXpNM0ZhSS9BQUFBQUFBQUNpMC9vUm95aWdVM0RNMC9zMTYwMC9CaXRjb2luMkVXVC0yNTYucG5nfDMxMHwxNTA1&amp;crp=true" height="150" width="310" format="wide" xmlns="" /><image xmlns="">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RtJbeyyCWT4/UuQuAzM3FaI/AAAAAAAACi0/oRoyigU3DM0/s1600/Bitcoin2EWT-256.png</image><image xmlns="">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ityK__abaYE/U61xCocMnzI/AAAAAAAAClA/3NVIjIZ4mJ4/s1600/MoveToLiteCoin.jpg</image></entry><entry><id>Doo Doo Economics Blog</id><title type="text">#MoveToLiteCoin #DefundTheFeds Bitcoin Response to Silk Road Auction</title><summary type="html">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The Bitcoin community is responding to the auction of seized Silk Road coins by moving money into LiteCoin and other alternative coins.

This is incentive for the law enforcement agencies to sell assets or spend seized cash, but without the rigor of traditional due process. &amp;nbsp;For instance, if you are a U.S. citizen carrying $10,000 in cash, it must be declared or it is subject to seizure. If seized, you must prove that it is yours and how you earned it. The legal system may not be impartial in the process because it can use the cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"80% of people whose property was seized by the federal government were never charged with a crime. Forfeiture proceedings are brought not against people, but against property that law enforcement need only allege is connected to criminal activity. "&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2014/02/US-v.-Ross-Ulbricht-Indictment.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; bitcoins were seized by the &lt;a href="http://www.usmarshals.gov/assets/2014/bitcoins/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Marshals Service&lt;/a&gt; from servers and 29,656 ($17,793,600) are to be auctioned. These coins are to be sold on June 27th over a 12-hour period to anyone willing to put up $200,000 as a deposit. Additionally, 144,341 ($86,604,600) bitcoins were seized from "Dread Pirate Roberts" or Ross William Ulbricht, the operator of Silk Road. Until recently, these coins were not available for law enforcement to sell on the market because they were unable to crack the encrypted password protection. Bitcoin proponents have pointed to this as proof that bitcoin is more secure than assets held in banks. Mr. Ulbricht apparently gave up this password as the coins have recently been moved into a new wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All bitcoin transactions are tracked automatically via the &lt;a href="http://www.blockchain.info/" target="_blank"&gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, so we can view the two accounts which held the Silk Road seized coins. &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1FfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okTjJJusN455paPH" target="_blank"&gt;DPR Seized Coins&lt;/a&gt; were moved to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1i7cZdoE9NcHSdAL5eGjmTJbBVqeQDwgw" target="_blank"&gt;DPR Seized Coins 2&lt;/a&gt; on July 12, 2014 in an apparent "shot over the bow" of the bitcoin community by the U.S. Government. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately the bureaucrats failed to realized that this warning shot might have consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money for fleets of shiny new government vehicles, huge salary bonuses and bloated expense accounts may now evaporate when the government attempts to cash in. &amp;nbsp;Undoubtedly, some government social media workers will then begin pushing a narrative that bitcoin is "unstable" as they did after someone sold down the price of bitcoin to $102, likely due to a trading glitch. &amp;nbsp;However, the price rebounded in minutes after that incident, which is not widely reported. The #MoveToLiteCoin campaign intends for the price of bitcoin to resume it's epic rise when the alt coin money returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the coins being used as repositories of crypto-wealth include:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://litecoin.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Litecoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://namecoin.info/" target="_blank"&gt;NameCoin&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://dogecoin.com/" target="_blank"&gt;DogeCoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.litecoinex.net/images/litecoin-logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img alt="LiteCoin" border="0" height="316" src="https://www.litecoinex.net/images/litecoin-logo.png" title="LiteCoin" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><rights type="text">Copyright 6/13/2014 1:58:00 PM</rights><thumbnail url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovL2kuaW1ndXIuY29tL1JHYmowQlguanBnfDIwNXwxNTA1&amp;crp=true" height="205" width="150" format="square" xmlns="" /><mainImage url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovL2kuaW1ndXIuY29tL1JHYmowQlguanBnfDMxMHwxNTA1&amp;crp=true" height="150" width="310" format="wide" xmlns="" /><image xmlns="">http://i.imgur.com/RGbj0BX.jpg</image><image xmlns="">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q0jXr7MCZk0/U5te7at32kI/AAAAAAAACkg/hzeo9ItAyPU/s1600/%23MoveToLiteCoin.png</image><image xmlns="">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pAz_3JuX4yE/U5te9v9ouxI/AAAAAAAACko/DGaF05ueeX0/s1600/BitCoinToLiteCoin.png</image><image xmlns="">https://www.litecoinex.net/images/litecoin-logo.png</image></entry><entry><id>Temple of Mut</id><title type="text">TAMCON 2014:  A photo essay of my TAMily</title><summary type="html">Dear Readers: Legal Insurrection will be publishing my formal post on TAMCON 2014 tomorrow.In the meantime, I wanted to share some of the great photos and moments I was able to capture at the first meet-up for The Tammy Bruce Show.I was privileged to win the lottery for a select group of TAM Army members to be able to join one of the best and most passionate conservative pundits, along with some of her support staff, for a perfect southern California afternoon of camaraderie for many independent-minded citizen activists and talk show fans.The event wouldn't have been complete without a[...]</summary><published>2014-06-15T13:25:45-07:00</published><updated>2014-06-15T16:00:20-07:00</updated><author><name>mutnodjmet13</name><uri>http://templeofmut.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/tamcon-2014-a-photo-essay-of-my-tamily/</uri></author><contributor><name>mutnodjmet13</name><uri>http://templeofmut.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/tamcon-2014-a-photo-essay-of-my-tamily/</uri></contributor><link rel="alternate" href="http://templeofmut.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/tamcon-2014-a-photo-essay-of-my-tamily/" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TAMCON 2014:  A photo essay of my TAMily" length="40" href="http://templeofmut.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/tamcon-2014-a-photo-essay-of-my-tamily/" /><category term="Flaming Capitalism" /><category term="TAMCON 2014" /><category term="Tammy Bruce" /><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Readers:  &lt;a href="http://legalinsurrection.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Legal Insurrection will be publishing my formal post on TAMCON 2014 tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I wanted to share some of the great photos and moments I was able to capture at the first &lt;a href="http://tammybruce.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;#8220;meet-up&amp;#8221; for The Tammy Bruce Show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was privileged to win the lottery for a select group of TAM Army members to be able to join one of the best and most passionate conservative pundits, along with some of her support staff, for a perfect southern California afternoon of &lt;span class="st"&gt;camaraderie&lt;/span&gt; for many independent-minded citizen activists and talk show fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been complete without a &amp;#8220;shameless fan moment&amp;#8221; at the post-event happy hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/li-05a-tammy-and-leslie.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9562" src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/li-05a-tammy-and-leslie.png?w=500" alt="LI #05A Tammy and Leslie"   /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My groupie behavior also including getting pics with Shifra, Ashley and Maynard &amp;#8212; mainstays of the show and the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting Shifra was a highlight, since many of her great posts on Tammy&amp;#8217;s site are an inspiration for my own work (&lt;a href="http://tammybruce.com/2013/02/shifras-reflections-on-missing-andrew-breitbart.html" target="_blank"&gt;check out the one on the anniversary of Andrew Breitbart&amp;#8217;s death for an example&lt;/a&gt;).  Her comments about the California weather and friendliness of the people she met here took the edge off of my insanity derived from living in the &amp;#8220;Land of Fruit and Nuts.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-002.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="TAMCon 2014 002" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9563" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashley made everyone feel so welcome, and her energy and enthusiasm enhanced the day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-013.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-013.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="TAMCon 2014 013" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9564" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit, loved, loved loved talking to Maynard &amp;#8212; his wit is as dry as the Sahara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-011.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-011.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="TAMCon 2014 011" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9565" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But were any of these people the star of the show?  No!  That honor went to Sydney Bruce, who is pictured with one of the best known of the TAMily members, Rob W!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-008.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-008.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="TAMCon 2014 008" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9566" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat myself down with four really great guys:  Mike, Steve, Carlos and Buster.  Buster came all the way from Texas to attend TAMCON!  We had a great time chatting about the news and who we were apt to vote for as POTUS in 2016 (hint &amp;#8211; Bush and Clinton were not among our picks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-001.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-001.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="TAMCon 2014 001" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9567" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael is the name of God&amp;#8217;s warrior arch-angel.  I think He was sending a message about the meet-up, as several of the other great men I met were also named Michael, including one who signed in with another TAMily member whose American-Israel flag pin caught my eye.  It turns out Thomas is a fellow Catholic, and were able to chat a few moments about being Catholic and conservative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-015.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-015.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="TAMCon 2014 015" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9568" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also met many dynamic women.  I would like to give a special shout-out to Lauren from Texas, who shared a margarita with me at the happy hour. I am kicking myself for not grabbing a pic with her!  A beautiful woman and a beautiful spirit! I also had a chance to meet Nonie, another San Diego area TAMily member.  We vowed to stay in touch and have our own mini-meet-up sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-006.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-006.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="TAMCon 2014 006" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9569" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite moments from the very many great ones I had was meeting naga5, Rick, who resides just to the north of Los Angeles.  We had a chance to compare-and-contrast local craft beet enterprises!  That he is such a savvy and energetic conservative who works in a very challenging environment for such political views is inspirational.  I am planning to keep in touch with him in hopes of better monitoring the craziness coming from the LA area.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture I took with IsaacT also failed to come out (but below is one of him getting a picture with Tammy).  However, I was thrilled to meet a Virginian and get the latest news from that state.  I am planning to be there in August, and the next TAMCON is slated to be held there soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-016.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tamcon-2014-016.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="TAMCon 2014 016" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9570" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: IsaacT comes through with a pic from his camera!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/imag0145.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://templeofmut.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/imag0145.jpg?w=500&amp;#038;h=375" alt="IMAG0145" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9577" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last note:  My formal post will contain information on two of Tammy&amp;#8217;s friends who also contribute to the success of her show:  &lt;a href="http://dontletitgo.com/amy/" target="_blank"&gt;Amy Peikoff &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://fawstin.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Bosch Fawtsin&lt;/a&gt;. Bosch is an exceptionally talent graphic artist who does superhero-inspired comics-style work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does work on commission:  &lt;strong&gt;I think I am going to have him work up a Cleopatra-theme &amp;#8220;Goddess of Flaming Capitalism&amp;#8221; graphic to spruce up the place!&lt;br /&gt;

You get the federal government involved, that’s how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will now be regulating the spent grains from the brewing process because of pet food or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For centuries, brewers have given or sold the leftover grain from the brewing process to local ranchers and dairy farmers for cattle feed. But new regulations proposed by &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/15/regulation-nation-breweries-fight-back-against-new-government-grain-rules/"&gt;the Food and Drug Administration threaten to end that relationship.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The whole brewing community was shocked about it," said Josh Deth, co-owner of Revolution Brewing in Chicago, Ill. &lt;br /&gt;Deth, whose title is "Chairman of the Party," says it's always been a great deal for both sides. The ranchers get the grain, and the brewers get those leftovers removed from their facilities for free. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We're trading, giving something of value to each other and working it out. I think that's one of the really great things, and people really hate to see the government get involved in something where they can just as easily stay out of this." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the FDA's proposed regulations, so-called spent grains would be regulated the same as pet food. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deth said the regulations would make it far too costly for him to prepare the grains to be passed along to farmers. The only remaining option would be sending it to a landfill, which would cost more than $100,000 a year.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That would be bad for dairy and cattle farmers like Jim Minich, who gets 30 tons of spent grain from Revolution Brewing each week. Not only does the grain save him more than $100,000 a year in feed costs, his 750 cows also produce more milk after chowing down on their "happy hour." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I mean it's just basically grain and it's got a lot of yeast in it and it's wet, so it adds to the palatability of the feed so they eat more," he said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regulations are part of the FDA's Food Safety Modernization Act, a sweeping new food safety reform law signed by President Obama in 2011. According to the FDA, the purpose of the law is to improve the safety of animal food.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And just like that, farmers like Minich will be adding $100,000/year to their operating costs and breweries like Revolution Brewing will be doing likewise all in the name of animal food safety?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Placentia, California, this is known as a solution in search of a problem as the article readily explains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There's no record of spent grains causing any problems for cows or humans, though, according to Chris Thorne, a spokesman with the Beer Institute. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We already meet or exceed the goals that the FDA would like us to see. So we see these regulatory procedures as completely unnecessary," Thorne told Fox News. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FDA was flooded by comments from brewers, distillers and cow farmers when the proposed rule was announced.   &lt;br /&gt;Responding to the outcry, the FDA said in a statement it is now looking to revise the language for the rule this summer before issuing a final decision sometime next year.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"We are working to develop regulations that are responsive to the concerns expressed, practical for businesses, and that also help ensure that food for animals is safe and will not cause injury to animals or humans," the FDA said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This represents a classic example of a sprawling federal bureaucracy looking to justify its existence by creating a make-work program, if you will, that accomplishes nothing but to the detriment of the dairy/cattle and brewing industries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you big government types, regulations are all fine and dandy when they don’t effect you.  However, think of this completely unwarranted and unnecessary intrusion into a completely voluntary and mutually beneficial business arrangement the next time you are pedaling your fixie over to Toronado for a Pliny the Younger.&lt;br /&gt;</content><rights type="text">Copyright 4/19/2014 11:47:00 AM</rights><thumbnail url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovLzIuYnAuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLy11cTBrUHpfTFVKQS9VMUxDdnZZc1VCSS9BQUFBQUFBQU14RS9sMTVxTTF3WlU2Zy9zNjQwL2JlZXIzNS5qcGd8MjA1fDE1MA2&amp;crp=true" height="205" width="150" format="square" xmlns="" /><mainImage url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovLzIuYnAuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLy11cTBrUHpfTFVKQS9VMUxDdnZZc1VCSS9BQUFBQUFBQU14RS9sMTVxTTF3WlU2Zy9zNjQwL2JlZXIzNS5qcGd8MzEwfDE1MA2&amp;crp=true" height="150" width="310" format="wide" xmlns="" /><image xmlns="">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uq0kPz_LUJA/U1LCvvYsUBI/AAAAAAAAMxE/l15qM1wZU6g/s640/beer35.jpg</image></entry><entry><id>Beers with Demo</id><title type="text">Mission Accomplished</title><summary type="html">.At a Rose Garden presser yesterday, heres the winner of the Washington Posts Lie of the Year do a victory lap in claiming that the administration met its goal of signing up 7 million enrollees for the federal healthcare law (aka "ObamaCare) by the March 31st deadline.&lt;br[...]</summary><published>2014-04-02T09:26:00-07:00</published><updated>2014-04-02T09:26:26-07:00</updated><author><name>Dean</name><uri>http://beerswithdemo.blogspot.com/2014/04/mission-accomplished.html</uri></author><contributor><name>Dean</name><uri>http://beerswithdemo.blogspot.com/2014/04/mission-accomplished.html</uri></contributor><link rel="alternate" href="http://beerswithdemo.blogspot.com/2014/04/mission-accomplished.html" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mission Accomplished" length="20" href="http://beerswithdemo.blogspot.com/2014/04/mission-accomplished.html" /><category term="Obamacare" /><content type="html">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a Rose Garden presser yesterday, here’s the winner of the Washington Post’s “Lie of the Year” do a victory lap in claiming that the administration met its goal of signing up 7 million “enrollees” for the federal healthcare law (aka "ObamaCare) by the March 31st deadline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/eowNuH7kXw8?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the administration that lied about being able to keep your plan and lied about being able to keep your doctor offers up no substantive data regarding this 7 million figure…. So, go ahead and spike the football, Preezy, we know you’re full of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The administration that from October 1st right up until yesterday was purposely vague as to the number of “enrollees” suddenly got purposely specific on the day after the sign-up deadline.  &lt;i&gt;Weird.&lt;/i&gt;   Forgive our cynicism but if the goal had been 8.5 million or 10.2 million, we know damn well what number they would’ve pulled out of their collective asses for yesterday’s presser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about this term “enrollee” – what specifically does it mean?  Again, no specifics from the White House because the only figure that matters is the number of people that have paid their premiums… a figure which the White House has been conveniently unable to provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the gloating and happy talk from the President, folk who have taken the time to crunch the numbers tell a different story.   &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/01/18/coverage-expansion-fail-less-than-one-third-of-obamacare-exchange-enrollees-were-previously-uninsured/"&gt;A survey of insurers and other industry players&lt;/a&gt; has shown that of those 7.1 million the administration is parading around,  anywhere between 65-89% of them were &lt;b&gt;previously insured&lt;/b&gt;.   And the majority of those  who previously had insurance signed up on the ObamaCare exchange because either their company dropped their coverage or their insurance plan was rendered illegal by ObamaCare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all this law has put us through for the last 4 years, in a nation of 350 million people, we are talking about insuring in the neighborhood of 2 million previously uninsured people with upwards of 45 million federal law-breakers still walking around out there scot-free.  &lt;i&gt;Heckuva job, guys&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The debate is over…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A curiously undemocratic thing for the leader of the Democratic Party to say.   Something like that is reserved for a person who knows he cannot debate his side on its own merits because the facts on the ground don’t support it.   Perhaps not coincidentally, it is also something said to us only by our parents while we were children, at least without getting heckled out of the room.   And perhaps not coincidentally, that’s the same line used by the global warming book-cookers and decline-hiders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can only hope the President’s un-Presidential gloating doesn’t lead his fan boys and fan girls to &lt;a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/01/anti-obamacare-cancer-patient-attacked-by-reid-now-receiving-death-wishes-from-liberals/"&gt;engage in more “civility” and “tolerance” like the below&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6OlkXbjk-Ys/Uzw3e6jEatI/AAAAAAAAMws/SUS3Mfsev2A/s1600/julie.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6OlkXbjk-Ys/Uzw3e6jEatI/AAAAAAAAMws/SUS3Mfsev2A/s640/julie.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were we saying again about not having the facts on one's side?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands currently, we will continue our fight in debating our side and happily subverting this law in any peaceful, legal and civil way we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><rights type="text">Copyright 4/2/2014 9:26:00 AM</rights><thumbnail url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovLzMuYnAuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLy02T2xrWGJqay1Zcy9VenczZTZqRWF0SS9BQUFBQUFBQU13cy9TVVMzTWZzZXYyQS9zNjQwL2p1bGllLmpwZ3wyMDV8MTUw0&amp;crp=true" height="205" width="150" format="square" xmlns="" /><mainImage url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovLzMuYnAuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLy02T2xrWGJqay1Zcy9VenczZTZqRWF0SS9BQUFBQUFBQU13cy9TVVMzTWZzZXYyQS9zNjQwL2p1bGllLmpwZ3wzMTB8MTUw0&amp;crp=true" height="150" width="310" format="wide" xmlns="" /><image xmlns="">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6OlkXbjk-Ys/Uzw3e6jEatI/AAAAAAAAMws/SUS3Mfsev2A/s640/julie.jpg</image></entry><entry><id>Word Warrior of So Cal</id><title type="text">REMEMBERING 9/11, TWELVE YEARS AFTER</title><summary type="html">It seems a long time since the attacks on 9/11/2001; and it seems like yesterday.

&lt;p&gt;It seems a long time since the attacks on 9/11/2001; and it seems like yesterday. That’s a trick your mind plays on you with traumatic memories: putting a healing distance between then and now, all the while indelibly imprinting the memory so it always seems fresh; easily recalled as clearly today as when it occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001 I was living in Michigan, a business man who worked out of his home office. That morning, I got my coffee and walked down to my office. It was just a few minutes before 9am on a crystal clear autumn morning. My office had a large window, and as I sipped my coffee I looked out at squirrels playing on my lawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I turned on my computer. Back then, Yahoo was my Homepage. As it booted-up, I glanced over and saw the “breaking news” banner: A plane had crashed into the World Trade Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked over to the living room and turned on the news. Against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, the live feed from New York City showed the North Tower of the World Trade Center, a huge bloom of smoke pouring from a gigantic rent high on the side of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentators in the news studio were speculating as to what could have caused a plane to somehow drift off its flight path and into the World Trade Center. They weren’t sure at that point if it was a small private plane, or a commercial aircraft. At that moment (it was now 9:03am) the second airliner came into view on the screen. A nano-second later, it crashed into the side of the South Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'&gt;&lt;iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='359' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/XELamUnF0EU?version=3&amp;#038;rel=1&amp;#038;fs=1&amp;#038;showsearch=0&amp;#038;showinfo=1&amp;#038;iv_load_policy=1&amp;#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I said something trite, like “OMFG!”; and sat my coffee down with a shaking hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One female commentator asked if something could be badly wrong with the local Air Traffic Control computers; perhaps erroneously vectoring planes into Mid-Town Manhattan. That question was just as quickly quelled by her partner, who stated (correctly) that this must be a deliberate act of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point after that, people started jumping out of the burning buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called my wife, who was working at a local hospital; leaving her a message to call me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9:39, the third plane struck the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="irc_mil" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;frm=1&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;docid=tDPd29na7aNckM&amp;amp;tbnid=5M3ktDuHtRiP5M:&amp;amp;ved=0CAUQjRw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foreignpolicy.com%2Farticles%2F2013%2F03%2F14%2Fpentagon_september_11&amp;amp;ei=6-IwUtmTOsm9iwK79YDABA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.52109249,d.cGE&amp;amp;psig=AFQjCNG8ABciqQHL-ShR8MPbg4IO9f-6Xw&amp;amp;ust=1379021790966131"&gt;&lt;img id="irc_mi" alt="" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSqNTMz7acXb2EJUzwE6noHRETd80cay9_mRY9CZWrzRedrxz9U" width="586" height="393" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think at that point, I must have gone into a altered state of consciousness; a sort of state of shock. I grew weirdly calm, detached, emotionally uninvolved with the disasters unfolding on the television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the television on in the background, I decided this was a good day to paint my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for those who know me, that is proof enough that I was in shock. I am not the home-fixer-upper type. But that morning, as the Towers collapsed (“Huh, you don’t see that every day!”) and Jet fighters were scrambled as there were reports of a fourth plane heading toward the Capital, I think my subconscious needed something exceedingly mundane to ground itself in a reality it could process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a veteran of Special Forces, and someone who has faced very difficult and deadly situations before. I don’t normally “lose it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on that otherwise beautiful September day, Barry had “checked out of the net” (as we used to say on the Teams). Elvis had left the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon and early evening, first my wife and children; then my friends and neighbors gathered at my home. I was relatively calm and still detached, discussing somberly the events unfolding when something happened that broke through my detachment; shattering the barrier my mind was busily erecting to protect me: My wife’s father, a happy alcoholic, decided that so many people in one place constituted a party. He put on music, people began to relax and laugh, talking about other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it seemed almost sacrilegious to be partying when so many people were dead or dying, when our country had just suffered the greatest attack since Pearl Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exploded. I don’t lose it very often, but I did that evening. I upbraided my father-in-law and those sharing his merriment: Didn’t they understand how inappropriate this was, I scolded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before making a complete fool of myself, I walked away. Stepping outside onto my lawn, I stood there in the Michigan evening twilight, and allowed myself to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_______________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a compilation of news coverage that morning, after the first plane struck but before the second; as they occurred that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was then, this is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; there was a Republican President. Then Democrat Presidential Candidate Obama said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obama:  The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/specials/CandidateQA/ObamaQA/" target="_blank"&gt;Interview with Charlie Savage of the Boston Globe, December 20, 2007 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now &lt;/em&gt;President Obama seems prepared to take military action against Syria, without even seeking the authorization by the United Nations or Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then &lt;/em&gt;a certain Democrat Senator from Delaware threatened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The president has no constitutional authority to take this country to war against a country of 70 million people unless we’re attacked or unless there is proof that we are about to be attacked. And if he does, I would move to impeach him.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Joe Biden, In a &lt;a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/61321/joe-biden-wanted-bush-impeached-for-the-very-thing-obama-is-about-to-do" target="_blank"&gt;December 2007 interview&lt;/a&gt; with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'&gt;&lt;iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='359' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/0xpfpciJzBU?version=3&amp;#038;rel=1&amp;#038;fs=1&amp;#038;showsearch=0&amp;#038;showinfo=1&amp;#038;iv_load_policy=1&amp;#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; Vice President Biden is extolling the virtue of taking action without the impediment of Congressional approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blatant hypocrisy on display would all be cynically amusing if it weren&amp;#8217;t set against the backdrop of a Syrian policy that defies reason or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two years the Obama Administration has ignored or dithered while thousands have died in Civil War that has become a humanitarian disaster. However, it is not our disaster; and reasonable people can disagree over wither or not we have any legitimate interests as a nation in intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a brutal dictator has used chemical weapons against his own people; who he was happily killing with conventional weapons for a couple of years now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF that is all it takes to justify intervention,&lt;em&gt; then&lt;/em&gt; Senators Obama and Biden should have been four-square behind&lt;em&gt; then&lt;/em&gt; President Bush for intervening in Iraq. There, another equally brutal dictator used chemical weapons to murder his own people (the Kurds). But, again,&lt;em&gt; then&lt;/em&gt; it was a Republican president; so the standards were different and the criticism strident from Obama, Biden, and Democrats in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt;, President Obama called for a regime change in Damascus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside. -&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;President Obama, August 16, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; the White House goes out of its way to reassure Assad (and his Big Brother, Vladimir Putin):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to make clear that the options that we are considering are NOT ABOUT REGIME CHANGE.&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/em&gt;White House Press Secretary and spokesman, Jay Carney, August 27, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt;, President Obama drew a &amp;#8220;red line&amp;#8221; in the sand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8230;a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;/em&gt;Obama at the White House on August 20, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;, despite Assad&amp;#8217;s use of such chemical weapons the President warned would violate his &amp;#8220;red line&amp;#8221;, the President seems to be trying to find wiggle room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re not considering any open-ended commitment. We’re not considering any boots on the ground approach. I have not made any decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. - &lt;/em&gt;Obama in a public appearance after a meeting with Baltic leaders, today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this helps explain why Obama today finds himself without credibility; at home or abroad. Nobody outside of the his own Administration and the most ardent Obamites like Chris Matthews take this man seriously when it comes to foreign policy; in Syria and elsewhere. Even our most steadfast ally in the world, Great Britain, has backed away from the President (not surprising, really, considering how for the last 5 years Obama has gone out of his way to put distance between us and our friend across the Pond).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His policy blows in the wind; entirely hostage to whims of the moment and politics at home. His calculus is not whether or not his actions and words will further American power and influence; but how it will influence his domestic agenda and the politics of the next election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American influence in the Middle East has never been lower. Into the vacume we are leaving, other Powers are stepping in. Putin&amp;#8217;s Russia is particularly &lt;a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/unpredictable-world-foreign-lukyanov/russia-putin-east-israel/" target="_blank"&gt;eager to regain the influence&lt;/a&gt; they lost there after the &amp;#8217;73 Yom Kippur War, and Anwar Sadat kicked the Soviets out of Egypt. There is even interest in a better relationship with Israel, as that long-time American ally feels increasingly friendless as a result of its chilly relationship with the Obama Administration. And Islamic fundamentalists and radicals are pleased at our decaying position, and just as eager to replace us as the dominant force in the Middle East. The Iranians want to create their &amp;#8220;Shite Crescent&amp;#8221; of control; while the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda want to see a pseudo-Caliphate created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, to appear to be strong and involved at last, Obama prepares to launch a billion dollar cruise missile strike against questionable targets with ambiguous goals; desperately seeking a way out of the corner he has painted himself into when he drew his &amp;#8220;red line&amp;#8221; in the Syrian sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A foreign policy blowing in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

The book is a defense of socialism and was recommended to me by a leftist college (biology) professor. He read it for his professors' book club. No doubt it's assigned reading in many classes around the country. I knew shortly after I published it that it was probably being used by students researching for those assignments. The fact that my, not especially eloquent, review is now reaching the top of my favorites list suggests one small way to reach high school students: writing reviews of leftist books, books likely to be assigned in classes. I doubt the students are finding much criticism of the books from the right, so one could be quite effective in providing arguments and convincing younger readers. Heck, you could have a whole blog devoted to it. Would be a breath of fresh air for the more rational students suffocating in the mustard gas of left-wing propaganda.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ShaneAtwellBlog/~4/sc7-1032SMI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content><rights type="text">Copyright 1/22/2013 5:00:00 AM</rights><thumbnail url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovL3VwbG9hZC53aWtpbWVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2lwZWRpYS9jb21tb25zL3RodW1iL2UvZTQvTWlhbWlDbGFzc3Jvb20uanBnLzIyMHB4LU1pYW1pQ2xhc3Nyb29tLmpwZ3wyMDV8MTUw0&amp;crp=true" height="205" width="150" format="square" xmlns="" /><mainImage url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovL3VwbG9hZC53aWtpbWVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2lwZWRpYS9jb21tb25zL3RodW1iL2UvZTQvTWlhbWlDbGFzc3Jvb20uanBnLzIyMHB4LU1pYW1pQ2xhc3Nyb29tLmpwZ3wzMTB8MTUw0&amp;crp=true" height="150" width="310" format="wide" xmlns="" /><image xmlns="">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/MiamiClassroom.jpg/220px-MiamiClassroom.jpg</image></entry><entry><id>Shane Atwell's Blog</id><title type="text">In Search of Where We Went Wrong</title><summary type="html">First a big thanks to Leslie Eastman, the most link generous blogger I know, fellow SLOB and now frequent contributor to College and Legal Insurrection.

This question has been bothering me for years. We started out with a near perfect system of government, as close as could have been achieved given the knowledge of the founders, a system that protected the individual's right to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness. Almost 250 years later the system is in taters. Our liberty and is hemmed in on all sides by &lt;a href="http://finance.townhall.com/columnists/politicalcalculations/2012/07/29/the_regulation_of_the_american_people/page/full/"&gt;hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations&lt;/a&gt;. Our property is taxed more than a medieval serf's. And our happiness is deemed ok if it is small. But if it is large and conspicuous then "&lt;a href="http://legalinsurrection.com/2012/07/obama-and-warren-cribbed-build-it-narrative-from-progressive-berkeley-professor/"&gt;you didn't build that&lt;/a&gt;" and don't expect to keep it our pass it to your children. What happiness we have is largely thanks to the productiveness of individuals in earlier, freer times (or in sectors that are lightly regulated). Similarly, what legal protections we have from the state are remnants of an earlier time and wouldn't exist if our &lt;a href="http://legalinsurrection.com/2012/12/extra-constitutional-power-is-what-theyve-always-wanted/"&gt;professors&lt;/a&gt;, politicians and &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/06/ginsburg-to-egyptians-wouldnt-use-us-constitution-as-model/"&gt;judges&lt;/a&gt; had their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why and when did we shift from the individualism of the Declaration of Independence to the collectivism of massive regulations, taxation and the welfare state? This is the question I've been trying to answer and has been a central motivation in my reading choices of the last few months. The answer should be helpful in getting us out of the mess we're in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tcMlom1eL._SS500_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time I thought that were were living through the abandonment of our founders' principles. I thought that &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0452011876/"&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; was prophecy. It might be in its description of the ultimate collapse of civilization. But in its description of the steps to that collapse...it's already happened. Not long ago I read Amity Shlaes &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forgotten-Man-History-Great-Depression/dp/0060936428/"&gt;The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tcMlom1eL._SS500_.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tcMlom1eL._SS500_.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There's not one government edict in &lt;i&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/i&gt; that didn't have some parallel in actual law from the 20s and 30s. The attacks on capitalism are there. The smearing of businessmen, there. The tongue-tied inability of most businessmen to defend themselves, there. The assumption that the government should be solving all problems, there. Neifeh and Smith's biography of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jackson-Pollock-American-Steven-Naifeh/dp/0913391190/"&gt;Jackson Pollack&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating book covering a similar time period. It's an inside look at the rise of irrationality in art and the government's takeover in order to promote welfare programs. (If you like Dostoevski, you'll like this biography.) In other words, &lt;i&gt;Atlas&lt;/i&gt; is as much a description of what happened under Hoover and FDR as it is a a description of what's happening under Bush and Obama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My interest in &lt;a href="http://shaneatwellblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/collective-bargaining-is-compulsory.html"&gt;collective bargaining&lt;/a&gt; as well as some recommendations of &lt;a href="http://industrialprogress.net/category/heroes/"&gt;Alex Epstein &lt;/a&gt;lead me to several books covering the late 19th century. I've already reviewed &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://shaneatwellblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/book-review-trial-of-haymarket.html"&gt;The Trial of the Haymarket Anarchists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, describing the anarchist attack on Chicago police in 1886 that was whitewashed out of memory by collectivist authors. More recently I read &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929587057/"&gt;1877: Year of Violence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by Robert Bruce describing the great railroad strikes and riots of that year. The take home message for me: in almost every violent clash between the strikers/rioters and faithful railroad employees or law enforcement, it was the strikers that first trespassed, first destroyed property, threw the first punch or fired the first shot. The author is sympathetic to the strikers, but provides sufficient detail to see who was standing for justice and who stood for violence and theft. I also read Chernow's biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr. &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1358189226&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=rockefeller+biography"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. What comes through in the later two books is that businessmen, industry, and success were already under attack in the 1870s and 1880s. Large businesses are considered "common carriers" with no right to operate as they see fit. During the railroad strikes, mobs ransacked and burnt not only railroad yards, but armories, gun shops, grain elevators and various local, unrelated businesses because they were "monopolists". Most of the nation's newspapers were sympathetic with the strikers. Rockefeller, involved in similar conflicts and controversies all his life, was silent until long after he was retired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the extent of the regulations was later dwarfed by the New Deal, the same types of laws existed in the late 19th century. The Sherman (R-OH) Anti-Trust Act was passed in 1890 to break up the somewhat artificial trust organization Rockefeller Oil had adopted to get around state controls concerning corporate ownership. Rockefeller was too successful. Where were the intellectual defenders of laissez-faire, of individualism? They must have existed, but they weren't popular enough to rate a mention in any of the books I've read. There were a couple vocal railroad executives that tried but that's it. I was shocked to see in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375756787/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Roosevelt (who entered politics in 1881) denigrate Thomas Paine, "filthy little atheist," and Thomas Jefferson, a "slippery demagogue".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battle lines between individualism and collectivism were thus already drawn in the 1880s and the individualists had already lost, at least the intellectual battle if not the political/legal one. Note that the Republicans were already joining Democrats to destroy capitalism. How far back do I have to go to find someone who defends the Constitution and capitalism? The next stop for me was &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inner-Civil-War-Northern-Intellectuals/dp/0252062744/"&gt;The Inner Civil War: Northern Intellectuals and the Crisis of the Union&lt;/a&gt; (H/T Chip Joyce through &lt;a href="http://www.hblist.com/"&gt;HBL&lt;/a&gt;). Enlightenment individualism and a respect for the rights of man played a large role in the early emancipation movement and civil war, but the entire enterprise was co-opted by nationalists, neo-aristocrats and other collectivists by the end. Much of them sounded like our neo-cons: war builds character, sacrifice, good of the nation, etc. By the end no one was discussing the rights of individual blacks. Of course the more individualistic, states-rights founders were significantly eclipsed (Jefferson especially).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transcendentalists (Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman) abandoned their "individualism" and embraced nationalism by the end of the war. This is perhaps not surprising because their individualism was more Kantian than Lockean, i.e. more mystical than empirical. They believed in some kind of otherworldly oversoul that we're mere shadows of. Emotions are the key to insight. Very platonic. They got their German philosophy from Carlyle's translations of Kant. All of which means that by the early 19th century the enlightenment, rational defense of individualism and individual rights had already lost in intellectual circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Constitution went into effect in 1789 and the Revolutionary generation was around for another couple decades, that leaves only a small window during which their enlightenment principles of individualism were supplanted. Probably between 1810 and 1840. If that is the case, then the culprit might be in the growth of new colleges, the importation of European professors and the education of many American's in Europe. In Europe, Kant's philosophy of unreal particulars and otherworldly forms came to dominate subsequent to the unresolved difficulties faced by the rationalists (e.g. Descartes) and empiricists (e.g. Locke). Kant's &lt;i&gt;Critique of Pure Reason &lt;/i&gt;was published in 1781, roughly contemporaneous with the Declaration of Independence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My journey half over I find that individualism might have been lost in America, at least intellectually, almost as soon as it had been enshrined. The publication of Kant's implicitly collectivist &lt;i&gt;Critique &lt;/i&gt;on the morning after the Declaration of Independence would fit an epic retelling of the history of collectivism versus individualism. "This will kill that" said Victor Hugo in another context. I still have much to read to figure out if Kant killed Locke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finishing the stroll backwards, I should mention one more book: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Independence-The-Struggle-America-Free/dp/B0071UHNDO/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Independence: The Struggle to Set America Free&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by John Ferling.&amp;nbsp; I've ready many biographies of the Founders, all of them good, but this has the virtue of covering all the figures so you get a complete picture and can place them relative to one another. It also does a fantastic job explaining the actual issues that motivated the colonists to rebel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to be continued...&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ShaneAtwellBlog/~4/yloVvmMj-1M" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content><rights type="text">Copyright 1/14/2013 5:37:00 PM</rights><thumbnail url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovLzEuYnAuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLy0wTUNaM0ZKWEpKcy9VQTd6ZU9FSWFuSS9BQUFBQUFBQUZsOC9ONnoxZzZrNVhTMC9zMzIwL251bWJlci1wYWdlcy1yZWd1bGF0aW9ucy1hZGRlZC10by1mZWRlcmFsLXJlZ2lzdGVyLWVhY2gteWVhci0xOTM2LTIwMTItcHJvamVjdGVkLnBuZ3wyMDV8MTUw0&amp;crp=true" height="205" width="150" format="square" xmlns="" /><mainImage url="http://www.theslobs.org/createthumb.ashx?ge=aHR0cDovLzEuYnAuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLy0wTUNaM0ZKWEpKcy9VQTd6ZU9FSWFuSS9BQUFBQUFBQUZsOC9ONnoxZzZrNVhTMC9zMzIwL251bWJlci1wYWdlcy1yZWd1bGF0aW9ucy1hZGRlZC10by1mZWRlcmFsLXJlZ2lzdGVyLWVhY2gteWVhci0xOTM2LTIwMTItcHJvamVjdGVkLnBuZ3wzMTB8MTUw0&amp;crp=true" height="150" width="310" format="wide" xmlns="" /><image xmlns="">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0MCZ3FJXJJs/UA7zeOEIanI/AAAAAAAAFl8/N6z1g6k5XS0/s320/number-pages-regulations-added-to-federal-register-each-year-1936-2012-projected.png</image><image xmlns="">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tcMlom1eL._SS500_.jpg</image></entry><entry><id>Lipstick Underground</id><title type="text">Suck It Up, Boys &amp; Girls</title><summary type="html">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; If I have to pull one more person off the ledge today Im going to start pushing.

Without my husband (who was working), I grabbed my 4 and 6 year-olds, printed a map of the route, turned on KFIAM 640 in Los Angeles and headed into the great unknown...as I’ve never explored that region East of USC (I lived in Long Beach for 15 years before becoming a country girl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;As we exited off the 110 onto Vernon to feel our way parallel to MLK Blvd, it was a relief to find the streets were NOT heavily blocked off as warned by news reports. We easily navigated our way East to the Leimert Park Village neighborhood where it was obvious locals were starting to gather for the approaching shuttle. And can I just say...what a cool neighborhood!! Very Harlem in the 90’s...definitely a community in Renaissance. Of course I had to clamp down on my 6-year-old who kept asking why everybody was wearing Obama t-shirts (I’ve indoctrinated her far too well!!).   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YhiHfdYmtqE/UHsWH85MEfI/AAAAAAAAAX0/UIsSIrTnwP8/s1600/DSC_0137.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="266" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YhiHfdYmtqE/UHsWH85MEfI/AAAAAAAAAX0/UIsSIrTnwP8/s400/DSC_0137.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The moment we got out on foot it was obvious the 100 mile trip was more than worth the $5/gallon gas and unfinished errands I left at home. Sure we could have just waited for the museum to open later this month. But the genuine excitement in the air was electric. This is a region of LA that has seen tough times in the past...that has a stigma of being much rougher and more dangerous than it really is. If it had not been the most direct route from the airport to the Science Center, it might not have been chosen by city leaders for this historic journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;But it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;And that made all the difference in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These communities were trusted with the privilege of escorting a piece of living history to it’s final resting place...and they made absolutely sure it was the best choice the city and NASA could have possibly made. Anyone too nervous to head to the area out of fear of the unknown missed one of THE GREATEST days in LA history. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And anyone who thinks the space program doesn’t matter, that it’s a waste of money, doesn’t know jack squat. When one of the most economically challenged communities in America, a community that one would expect would want tax dollars spend on domestic, not space programs, rolls out the red carpet and shows reverence for the Space Shuttle and the astronauts in-tow, it means that people really can be inspired...even unified, by profound acts of faith and courage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids with Space Shuttle toys. Homemade t-shirts to commemorate the event. Every piece of electronic recording device known to man. Gasps and applause at first sightings. Strangers making sure kids got best viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one argued when they had to give up their long claimed ‘spots’ when organizers warned they were in unsafe locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were on an elevated side street and the port wing passed close enough to touch...but nobody did. Not the families with excited kids, not the gang bangers, not the space geeks, not the photography junkies. The shuttle belongs to all of us and that is how everyone treated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proud. Excited. Welcoming. Considerate. Joyful.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DaDN-fLROlw/UHsWqXk0ARI/AAAAAAAAAYA/Z-dnn6LsQdo/s1600/DSC_0140.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left;

The history of the moment was more important than agendas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LA doesn’t always shine. It has seen its share of sordid tales, and today its being crushed by its own mismanagement. But I can’t help but love this city. Yesterday was a reminder that I’m not a starry eyed school girl with a misguided crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;P.S. Yes, I sound like a gigantic kumbaya Lib. Back to snarky bitch tomorrow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;P.P.S. These photos do not do the moment justice. With two small kids in a crowed area, there was only so much I was going to try doing with lenses, angles, etc. There was perfect magic hour lighting available, and my husband would have gotten AMAZING pictures. But I hope this gives a rough idea of our tiny slice of the route. There were some pretty cool landmarks like the Red Carpet Car Wash, Southwest Police Station, MLK &amp;amp; Crenshaw,Randy’s donuts etc. etc. for untethered photogs on foot!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><rights type="text">Copyright 10/14/2012 1:02:00 PM</rights><thumbnail
