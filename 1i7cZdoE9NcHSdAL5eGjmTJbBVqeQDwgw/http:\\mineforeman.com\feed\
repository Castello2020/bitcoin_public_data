can be turned off on the settings page with a simple check box.</p><p>Further digging shows that you will find this registration script in /etc/cron.d/pandp_register.sh on the device.  The only extra bit of information that is included in the registration is the board ID (mine is FL0914990010) and that is there because it is necessary to work out what firmware version you require.</p><p>Disabling Device Registration does exactly that and your miner will never contact Spondoolies-Tech again unless you ask it to (i.e A firmware upgrade request).</p><p>Once you have located your miner (via the site provided or from your DHCP server on your router) and entered it&#8217;s IP into your web browser you will be greeted with an Apache Auth dialogue box asking for your user name and password, it even will tell you the default username and password for the device (admin/admin, I recommend you to change it on the settings page ASAP).</p><div id="attachment_3036" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Login.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3036" alt="Login" src="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Login.png" width="636" height="167" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Login Screen</p></div><p>After entering your credentials you will be taken directly to the main &#8220;Status Screen&#8221; for your miner.  This will be familiar to MinePeon users but for new users it is a snapshot of what your miner is up to including a graph, general information about version of software your miner is running, details on how your miner is interacting with your pool (or pools) and of course the statistics from your miner&#8217;s ASIC&#8217;s.</p><div id="attachment_3039" style="width: 1192px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Status.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3039" alt="Status" src="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Status.png" width="1182" height="776" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Main Status Screen</p></div><p>Included are buttons to restart cgminer, Miner_Gate (the supervisory process for the SP10) as well as buttons to reboot and shut-down the entire miner.  It should be noted that the statistics from the mining device is not pulled from the cgminer API as MinePeon does but it is pulled directly from the mining hardware.</p><p>For some unknown reason (I am working to work out why) cgminer and the pool disagree how many hashes per second the SP10 is doing.  It has something to do with the driver and it is being investigated but for the time being pulling the hashrate direct from the device is the best way to get what your miner says it is doing and what the pool says it is doing to match.  Rest assured though, if it says 1.51 TH/s at the top as mine does, that is what the pool is paying you for (I checked).</p><p>The next screen you should visit is the pools screen, as far as I can tell it is an exact copy of the MinePeon one with no changes.  You should get in here as fast as possible so you can set your own pools up.</p><div id="attachment_3041" style="width: 1190px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pools.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3041" alt="Pools" src="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pools.png" width="1180" height="476" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Pools Page</p></div><p>Everything here should be self explanatory.  You can use my pools as an example (feel free to use my pools even).  If there are not enough pools to fit your needs just add a few and submit them and the page will add a few extra blank entry&#8217;s at the bottom so you can add more.</p><p>Once you have entered your pool information you will need to pop back to the status screen and check that they are running.  If it is reluctant to change to your pools you can use the &#8220;Restart CgMiner&#8221; or  &#8220;Reboot&#8221; buttons.</p><p>The settings page, while being similar to the standard MinePeon page has settings particular to the SP10 Dawson and has removed the more generic settings that don&#8217;t apply.  Below I have taken screenshots of the new options and have briefly described what they do.</p><div id="attachment_3044" style="width: 987px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MinerSpeed.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3044 " alt="MinerSpeed" src="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MinerSpeed.png" width="977" height="227" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">If you find your miner is too noisy or takes too much power you can switch down a gear at the cost of your hashrate.</p></div><div id="attachment_3045" style="width: 1051px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NetworkSettings.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3045 " alt="NetworkSettings" src="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NetworkSettings.png" width="1041" height="242" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Something I have yet to bring to MinePeon standard, you can turn off DHCP and set a static IP address.</p></div><div id="attachment_3046" style="width: 1192px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Password.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3046" alt="Password" src="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Password.png" width="1182" height="612" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Spondoolies-Tech have added the option to change your SSH password as well as your WebUI password from the WebUI.

and pressing the button will contact Spondoolies-Tech to check if there is an update.  If an updates is available it will download and install the update as I have pictured below.</p><p>I know from experience that getting updates to work every time is something that is difficult to do but after looking at Spondoolies-Tech&#8217;s method I have to approve.  Even if there is an issue (such a power cut during the update) the <a href="http://storage.googleapis.com/spond_firmware/recovery/spond_recovery.tar" target="_blank">Recovery Image</a> available on the <a href="http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/blogs/technical-blog" target="_blank">technical blog</a> seems to work flawlessly.  Just so you don&#8217;t have to, I even tried it by pulling the power half way through an upgrade and it recovered my SP10 just fine.</p><p><a href="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FirmwareUpgrade.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3053" alt="FirmwareUpgrade" src="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FirmwareUpgrade.png" width="1170" height="542" /></a></p><p>The final page I would like to show you is their ASIC status page.  Here you can view detailed information as to what each of your 192 (numbered 0- 191) individual Hammer ASIC&#8217;s are up to.  This is a level of detail that I have not seen before in ASIC manufacturers and while not being very much use to the average user it provides a great deal of information for debugging.</p><p><a href="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ASICStatus.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3054" alt="ASICStatus" src="http://mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ASICStatus.png" width="1119" height="945" /></a></p><p>Spondoolies-Tech have been very generous and open with their sources, if you checkout their <a href="https://github.com/Spondoolies-Tech" target="_blank">GitHub Account</a> you will find repositories for everything you will need to build your own &#8220;Spondoolies-Tech Miner&#8221; if you wanted to.  You will find repositories for their <a href="https://github.com/Spondoolies-Tech/kernel" target="_blank">Custom Linux Kernel</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/Spondoolies-Tech/u-boot" target="_blank">uBoot</a> needed to boot it.  Their version of <a href="https://github.com/Spondoolies-Tech/cgminer" target="_blank">cgminer</a> is also available to download.</p><p>They have even released their propitiatory <a href="https://github.com/Spondoolies-Tech/miner_gate" target="_blank">Miner_Gate</a> software as open source for inspection.</p><p><strong>Conclusion (So Far):</strong> I am very impressed with what Spondoolies-Tech has done, they have offered me (and any who care to look) unparalleled access to their software and their version of MinePeon is something they can be proud of.  Their custom Operating System is well written and looks to be very stable.  A lot of what they have done to extend MinePeon will be making it&#8217;s way back to the standard distribution and they have given me access to their systems so that I may also bring new MinePeon features to Spondoolies-Tech users.</p><p>After doing a through crawl thorough the software (far more thorough that the &#8220;reader friendly&#8221; version above) I can find few faults in what they have done and those fault&#8217;s that I have found Spondoolies-Tech have already fixed or are in the process of fixing.</p><p>Additionally their policy of only selling technology that they have in hand instead of burdening their clients with pre-orders to fund themselves is a refreshing thing in today&#8217;s bitcoin economy.</p><p>What they have done so far is impressive, I look forward to seeing what they will come out with next!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://mineforeman.com/2014/04/01/review-spondoolies-tech-sp10-dawson-part-two/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>1</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Review: Spondoolies-Tech SP10 Dawson (Part One)</title><link>http://mineforeman.com/2014/03/28/review-spondoolies-tech-sp10-dawson-part-one/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=review-spondoolies-tech-sp10-dawson-part-one</link> <comments>http://mineforeman.com/2014/03/28/review-spondoolies-tech-sp10-dawson-part-one/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2014 03:25:38 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Neil Fincham]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Hardware]]></category> <category><![CDATA[MinePeon]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Review]]></category> <category><![CDATA[spondoolies-tech]]></category> <category><![CDATA[review]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://mineforeman.com/?p=2985</guid> <description><![CDATA[About a month ago I received a pleasant email from a gentleman named Stas, he complimented me on MinePeon and asked me if I would have any issue if he included all or parts MinePeon on a new range of miners<span class="ellipsis">&#8230;</span><div class="read-more"><a href="http://mineforeman.com/2014/03/28/review-spondoolies-tech-sp10-dawson-part-one/">Read more &#8250;</a></div>]]></description> <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2986" alt="SpondooliesLogo-transparent-small" src="http://i2.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SpondooliesLogo-transparent-small.png?resize=250%2C52" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>About a month ago I received a pleasant email from a gentleman named Stas, he complimented me on <a href="http://minepeon.com/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">MinePeon</a> and asked me if I would have any issue if he included all or parts MinePeon on a new range of miners that he was intending to bring to market.  I told him, as I always do, he was free to use MinePeon however he wished.</p><p>When I first built MinePeon over a year ago it was intented as a hobby that would be free for anyone to use and learn about bitcoin, mining and Linux in general.  It has evolved a lot since then and it will be evolving even more in the future but I have always been pleased when people use it and I invite anyone to use it as if it were their own.</p><p>Stas thanked me for my permission (not that he needed it) and offered to send me a unit when it was ready for review and I gladly accepted&#8230;&#8230;  Little did I know what I was in for, people have occasional sent me a USB miner or two to help with MinePeon support but it was only last week that I found out what Stas and his company Spondoolies-Tech were truly up to!</p><p>I was first aware of what I was about to receive when <a href="http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/" target="_blank">Spondoolies-Tech&#8217;s</a>  announced it on <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=521520.0" target="_blank">BitcoinTalk</a> and Stas sent me a &#8220;head&#8217;s up&#8221; email.   Along with the unveiling their website, they announced that (in contrast to what seems to be the norm with bitcoin manufacturers) they had actually designed, prototyped and started to produce two new fully self contained bitcoin miners.</p><p>The first (the one that I was about to receive) is called the  <a href="http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/products/2-units-of-sp10-dawson-may-batch" target="_blank">SP10 Dawson</a> and is a 1.4 TH/s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack" target="_blank">1.25U rack fit</a> bitcoin miner, the second is called the <a href="http://www.spondoolies-tech.com/products/sp30-yokon" target="_blank">SP30 Yokon</a> and is a 5.4 TH/s 2U rack fit bitcoin miner (to be fair though, the SP 30 is only just hitting the production lines and not already in production).</p><p><strong>Anyway enough of how I got one, let&#8217;s get on to part one of the review.</strong></p><p>First, you may wish to have a look at <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=525469" target="_blank">Dogie&#8217;s review on BitcoinTalk</a>, he has done a tear down of the miner and has quite some expertise in the physical characteristics of hardware and I am not going to try to replicate his findings.</p><p>Shipping was via DHL Express (I am told that all shipping will be express) and took 7 days all told to arrive in New Zealand.  Believe it or not that is actually quite good for large shipments like this to get all the way down here to the end of the earth.  The entire package was 14 KG (just under 32 pounds for the metrically challenged).  The packaging as you will see in the photo below is a heavy-duty corrugated cardboard making it not only quite secure and light but quite eco friendly.</p><div id="attachment_2983" style="width: 982px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechBox.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2983 " alt="SPTechBox" src="http://i0.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechBox.jpg?resize=550%2C411" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SP 10 box opened and upper layer of corrugated cardboard removed showing the front of the miner and the &#8220;spondooliestech&#8221;

lead and the one below it is a &#8220;Blink&#8221; LED that you can enable from the WebUI to help you to find your miner if it is in a rack cabinet among other, identical miners.</p><p>It is important to note, these LED&#8217;s and port&#8217;s are all on a single board that acts as the controller for the miner.  The controller is modeled after the widely available <a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone+Black" target="_blank">BeagleBone Black</a> ARM7 device and while not being exactly the same in physical layout (the extra LED&#8217;s, RJ11 console port and button for example) it is functionally identical.  So much so the BeagleBone Black version of MinePeon boot&#8217;s without modification (it does not run the miner yet).</p><div style="width: 652px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechBBB.jpg"><img alt="SPTechBBB" src="http://i2.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechBBB.jpg?resize=550%2C264" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The &#8220;controller board&#8221; part of the miner.</p></div><p>Another feature that I would like to point out is the server grade <a href="http://goo.gl/i9XO4s" target="_blank">Emerson DS1050</a> swappable power supply pictured below.  It is rated to 1050 Watt&#8217;s and in actual use the entire unit is pulling 1388 watts at New Zealand&#8217;s 230 volts at the wall, the total power consumption being below a respectable 1 Watt per GigaHash.</p><p>Together with the cooling fans the unit produces a whopping 76 DB of server whine.  While this is nothing unusual for rack mount equipment it is certainly nothing you want sitting in your living room (or garage if it is not sound proofed).  It is remarkably simular to listening to a Boeing 747 engines at idle when parked on the tarmac.</p><div id="attachment_2979" style="width: 561px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechPS.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2979" alt="SPTechPS" src="http://i2.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechPS.jpg?resize=550%2C327" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The power supply.</p></div><p>Finally, there is a small plastic bag included in the box that contains a 8GB SD Card, a USB console cable to be used with the mentioned console port and 4 rubber feet for use if you are not planning to rack mount the device.</p><div id="attachment_2997" style="width: 658px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechBits1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2997" alt="SPTechBits" src="http://i2.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechBits1.jpg?resize=550%2C411" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The extra bits included in the box</p></div><p>Installation of the unit was very simple, there are only 2 cables necessary for operation, a network cable and a power cable.  After that, configuration will be very familiar to MinePeon users, all you need to do is login to the WebUI (username admin password admin), set your pool and you are done.</p><p>All told, once I worked out the right username/password combination (minpeon uses something slightly different, minepeon/peon) it was up and running in minutes.</p><p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechOS.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2984" alt="SPTechOS" src="http://i1.wp.com/mineforeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SPTechOS.jpg?resize=550%2C198" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p><p>A quick look at the (very familiar MinePeon) status page it told me that the miner was purring along at 1.49 TH/s .</p><p>I am going to end the first part of the review here.  I was intending to do a full explanation of my findings about the OS but I soon realised that there was a lot more to cover than I can do in just the single day since I have received the unit.</p><p>At the moment I plan to do two more articles, in the next I will be doing a tear down of the operating system, kernel, supervisory processes, mining processes (cgminer) and user interface (all released as open source).</p><p>Quite a bit of what is there was written by me and is part of MinePeon but there is also a lot of Spondoolies-Tech code that looks very nice and I will be taking a closer look at.  In particular, instead of starting with Arch Linux as a base as with MinePeon they have built their own linux distribution under there to support their drivers and modules.  Using a custom build OS can be a bit of a two edge sword, the OS is cut down and very purpose driven (somthing I like alot) but may be a bit daunting for casual coders to work with (I hope to ease that somewhat).</p><p>In the final part I hope to bring you a bit more information about Spondoolies-Tech, how they intend to do business and what their future plans are.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://mineforeman.com/2014/03/28/review-spondoolies-tech-sp10-dawson-part-one/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>MinePeon for BeagleBone Black Alpha</title><link>http://mineforeman.com/2014/03/25/minepeon-for-beaglebone-black-alpha/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=minepeon-for-beaglebone-black-alpha</link> <comments>http://mineforeman.com/2014/03/25/minepeon-for-beaglebone-black-alpha/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2014 22:06:28 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Neil Fincham]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://mineforeman.com/?p=2972</guid> <description><![CDATA[MinePeon users have been asking for this for a while and I am finally glad to announce, MinePeon has been ported!

I have also made up a sub board on the <a href="http://minepeon.com/forums/" target="_blank">MinePeon forums</a> for bug reports etc.</p><p><strong>Recommended before you start;-</strong></p><p>Update your BeagleBone Black to the latest Angstrom with the following link. This is not totally necessary but some old versions required you to push the boot button on the board while booting from the SD card. Newer versions allow you to just put the SD card in and it will boot from that by default.</p><p><a href="http://beagleboard.org/Getting%20Started#update">http://beagleboard.org/Getting%20Started#update</a></p><p><strong>Install Instructions</strong></p><p>1. Download the image MinePeon-0.2.4.6-BeagleBoneBlack-Alpha.img from;-</p><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/minepeon/files/release/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/minepeon/files/release/</a></p><p>2. Write the image to a SD card (minimum 2GB). You can use the instructions here for that;-</p><p><a href="http://minepeon.com/index.php/Troubleshooting#How_to_write_MinePeon_to_SD">http://minepeon.com/index.php/Troublesh &#8230; Peon_to_SD</a></p><p>3. Insert your SD card into your BeagleBone Black, plug in your hubs/miners and power on.</p><p>4. Everything else should be just like the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>5.

The Imperial Monarch will operate at 1 TH/s (+ / &#8211; 20%).</p><p><strong>Six Month Refund or Double Shipment Guarantee</strong></p><p>If you’ve been waiting in queue for six months or more, you qualify for either a full refund in USD, OR double the hardware you ordered. This latter option will come in the form of (a) first shipping you the new Imperial Monarch, giving you an expected 160-175% of your ordered hashrate, and then (b) an additional Standard 600 GH Monarch at the end of the queue, giving you another 100% hashrate boost, totaling an expected 250+% of your ordered hashrate once all products have shipped. (Note: Electing the refund cancels the Imperial Monarch upgrade offer in the first section above.)</p><p><strong>50% off Voucher</strong></p><p>If your paid order is less than 6 months old but you paid $4680 for your Monarch, you will instead receive an Imperial Monarch as described above, as well as a 50% off discount on an additional Standard Monarch at the end of the queue.</p><p><strong>Full Price 300GH Monarchs</strong></p><p>For 300GH Monarch orders, similar but slightly different offers will be extended. Customers will be contacted with specifics via email soon.</p><p><strong>Mining By the GigaHash</strong></p><p>If your Mining By the GH paid order is more than 6 months old, you will receive 2x the hashrate purchased.</p><p><strong>Reduced Price Orders</strong></p><p>Individual orders that are less than 6 months old and that paid for the reduced price 600GH or 300GH Monarch will likely not be delayed past the expected delivery date.</p><p><strong>Refunds will be issued in 30 to 45 days from the date of request of refund. Refunds will be in USD.</strong></p></blockquote><p>So it seems if you have the dubious luck to have ordered over sit months ago like myself (I ordered and paid on August 28, 2013, some 192 days Or 6 months, 8 days) not only is your 600 GH/s Monarch going to be upgraded to a 1 TH/s Monarch you are going to get yet another 600 GH/s Monarch for your troubles.  That is a total of 1.6 TH/s.</p><p>You and I could also get a refund of your $4,680.00 in some 30 to 45 days (I wont go into how many bitcoins I acutely paid, or how much they are worth now).  I have to admit, I am probably going to continue my wait.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://mineforeman.com/2014/03/08/butterflylabs-sweeten-the-pot-for-long-outstanding-orders/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
