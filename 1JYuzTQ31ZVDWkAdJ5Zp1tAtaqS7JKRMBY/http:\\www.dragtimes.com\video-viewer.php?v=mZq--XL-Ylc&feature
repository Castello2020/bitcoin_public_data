Motorcycle Hits Deer @ 85 mph | Helmet Cam
ANALYSIS & Damage Assessment: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQRv1H9_v4A
************************************************************************
I hit a buck (had 2+ in. antlers) on my 04 GSXR 1000 on June 28, 2009. I did not crash, but the bike was totaled. It literally jumped right in
front of me and I had no time to react! In the analysis (link above), you
can see the deer was only on cam for 6 frames which is 6/30 or 1/5 of a
sec! Therefore, speed had nothing to do with impact.
Factors to consider (in debatable order of importance):
1. Speed: a) at speed limit would only have had .5 sec to react b) going faster *I* would have evaded... could
have hit someone else
2. Momentum: a) accelerating out of the corner b) not enough time to let
off
3. Angle: Bike was almost all the way leaned over
4. Deer mid-air: a) less resistance b) not high enough to knock me off and
kill me instantly
5. Deer impact location: Only hit neck, not body
6. Deer angle: Jumped from -right- side while I was leaning -right- into it
7. Deer weight: a) approx. 100 lbs (45 kg) b) not fully
grown buck yet
8. Ride position: Usually hang off bike, but was taking it easy
9. Frame sliders: Protected leg from tearing off
10. Exhaust: OEM (not shorty)
prevented carcass from hitting rear wheel
11. Post impact: No car in oncoming lane
12. Wobbles: Violent steering caused front wheel to lift off ground 13. Bars: a) throttle hand came off b) if left hand came off... whiiiskey
throttle! 14. Corner: Caught bars and dropped front just in time to turn, avoiding
woods
15. Full gear: Deer brushed knee- no injury
16. Camera angle: a) cam tilted too low b) if normal, impact wouldn't be
visible
17. Rider behind: a) avoided spinning deer in approx 1 second b) didn't swerve
18. # of riders: 10 approx 1-10 secs ahead and 5 approx 1-10 secs behind
19. Following distance: Deer jumped in between 2 riders
20. TIME UNPREDICTABLE: a) time the deer jumped b) time i was there that
day
I rode the bike for another 45 mins until I had to shut it off to prevent
engine damage because the radiator was busted. I survived without a
scratch. The deer was still in mid air as it's neck/shoulder was sliced by
my right fork and brake rotor. Then it busted my frame slider all the way
back, brushed my knee (leaving fur in the velcro), and flung off the Exhaust, when it made like a top and spun
to the other side of the road, leaving a blood trail over 50 ft. The 2
lines of blood keep intersecting, which show how much the deer spun.
Lastly, I want to mention that my right is a wide open field. There's 1/4
mile before woods. Deer heard us coming at least 10-20 secs before the
first rider passed. If it did not hear us coming from miles away, then it
had to have seen the other bikes go by. It tried to go between us... This
stray deer ignored all instincts! Freak accident and nothing else! If you
think slower speed would have avoided impact, then watch the analysis. If I
was going faster, I would have
avoided it entirely and the guy behind me could have hit it too. Am I lucky I didn't die or am I unlucky this shit happened? Many things in
life cannot be controlled...like cancer. If you try to figure out why it
happened, you'll never get anywhere. Don't ask why, don't let it affect
your outlook on life, just try to keep calm and carry on!
