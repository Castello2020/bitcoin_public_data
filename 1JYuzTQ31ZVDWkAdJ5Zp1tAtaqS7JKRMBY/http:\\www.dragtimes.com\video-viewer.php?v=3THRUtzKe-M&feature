Mallala Saloon Car race helmet cam - 31 October 2010 - Holden Commodore VN
This is an in-car video from VN Commodore Saloon Car #91 driven by me,
Naomi Maltby. This is race 4 from the final round of the 2010 SA State
Motor Racing Championships at Mallala Motorsport Park. There is a crash on
the first lap and the car wasn't handling so good after that - actually I
didn't think it would finish the race because a tyre was rubbing and it had
a bit of a wobble, but we made it. The date stamp is incorrect, I don't
know how to set it. Enjoy!

1911 Curtiss Pusher Flight
October 25, 2010. Ride along on a Curtiss Pusher flight. The wind was
picking up after take-off, probably about 10-15 mph by the time of landing.
Sorry about the tilted horizon, we just tie-wrapped a camcorder to the
side of my head, and didn't get it quite straight. Also, at one point it
got moved a little and showed that I should've shaved that morning. The
main instruments are in front of the seat, so that is why I sometimes look
down towards my feet. Notice the yaw string on top of the front elevator
control rod, to show if you are skidding or slipping. Wing loading is only
about 4 lbs/sq. ft. so it feels every bump, notice especially the gust that
hits at about 6:30. This aircraft will appear at various airshows and
events in 2011 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of US Naval Aviation.
Laguna Seca - 2008 e92 M3 Coupe 6spd - In Car Helmet Cam

"performance driving" event at Laguna Seca. Car is stock, with BFG R1
tires. Top speed down front stretch was approximately 120mph.

Top Fuel Dragster Helmet Cam - Phil Read
Phil Read Elimination round 1 at Perth Motorplex, January 29th 2011. Helmet
cam view of Phil's pass. $800 worth of Nitro Methane gone in 2 minutes. Supercharger blows off and yet another
fireball in the second half of the pass. Car still ran 4.90, but had more
speed at half track than at the finish. Next pass was more steady and much
faster - 311mph (501kph) in a
virtual dead heat with Phil Lamattina. 4.806 vs 4.808. TOP FUEL is
something you HAVE to experience first-hand at some stage in your life,
even if just once. And if you like this clip, you'll love this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdtQ1dI-bJk
