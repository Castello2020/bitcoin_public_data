bought this months ago but only just got around to playing it. wow! awesome game :) really enjoy platform puzzlers like this, especially when they involve more clever thinking than pixel-perfect jumping

Love the game, but spoiled a little for me with the XNA framerate issue (similar to games like Bastion) where the refresh rate gets locked to 58/59 or below instead of 60, resulting (for some of us at least) in 'judder' every second or so (and my skills are already handicapped in games like these! ;) )
Any chance of a quick-and-dirty optional XNA fix like the Bastion guys (and a few other XNA devs) have ended up doing? e.g:
> Forums.steampowered.com
["You may now try adding: -nofixedstep
Using this option, the game will no longer dictate the frame-rate by itself. If Vsync is left on, the refresh rate of your monitor will determine the frame-rate. If this is 60hz, this may cause the game to run exactly as desired."]
(PS - wishing you great success on Steam)

This happened to me too on accident and it scared me for a minute lol.
Just pause the game and the language options are at the bottom of the screen underneath 'Quit Game'

Been playing it from groupees bundle, good and very polished gameplay, and actually runs relatively smoothly on my weak laptop at 1024x768. Only exception so far is the level where the Big ball appears for the first time - for some reason, framerate took a large dive there.

Just finished it - one of the very best puzzle-platformers I've ever played (and these days it seems every other indie game is a puzzle platformer.)
It did have some stability issues - plenty of crashes to desktop but all of them were from the level selection screen (except a couple after alt-tabbing) so no progress was ever lost due to the auto-save at the end of every level / storage device.
One question though how do you get the very last storage device? That's the only one that I proved too dumb to retrieve. I hope I didn't miss a better ending because of it...
By the way, an idea for a "Hard" difficulty would be to require that in order for a storage device retrieval to count, the player must get safely to the exit door after retrieving the device (similar to Super Meat Boy and bandaids.) I'm assuming this is possible on all levels, though I'm not quite sure. Now this would be way too hard for me, but I'm sure some players would enjoy the challenge :)

We thought about that a lot. and we found that if you need to get storage device "and" get through the door. It will be crazy difficult, annoying and some levels will be out right impossible. We do want to make a Check Point Mode though. redesign some level. and you must pass certain points of that level to beat it.
The last one is crazy hard. you will need to manipulate the momentum of that yellow stick to get it. it needs crazy percise timing

用了三天的時間終於全破完了(全要素收集)
遊戲很好玩，且音樂也很好聽
劇情更是讓人不斷想繼續看下去(最後有點算"感人"嗎?) 期待續作瞜~

I am going to be honest, some people will find certain puzzles in this game annoying (especially later ones), as Constant C is not a game for everyone. But the 'Ah-ha' moment that you finally figure it out is extremely satisfying. This game also have a strong story arc, though not in the foreground. But piece together the mysterious events that happened while struggling to understand the physics and time mechanics just adds more flavors on to each part. Graphic is not astonishing or artistically…
