        <p>EDIT: You can use the native VPN client in Mac OS X instead of the CiscoVPN software. Here's a guide that tells you <a href="http://anders.com/guides/native-cisco-vpn-on-mac-os-x/">how to convert from CiscoVPN to the native OS X client</a>.<br />
<br />
If you are running Cisco's VPNClient on Mac OSX, you might be familiar with (or tormented by) "<a href="http://www.anders.com/images/1offs/vpn-client.jpg">Error 51: Unable to communicate with the VPN subsystem</a>". The simple fix is to quit VPNClient, open a Terminal window, (Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Terminal) and type one of the following:<br />
<br />
(for older versions)<br />
sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoVPN/CiscoVPN restart<br />
<br />
(for newer versions)<br />
sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext<br />
<br />
and give your password when it asks. This will stop and start the "VPN Subsystem", or in other words restart the CiscoVPN.kext extension. Cisco seems to have problems when network adapters disappear and reappear, something that happens commonly in Wireless or Dial-up scenerios. Sometimes putting a system to sleep, disconnecting an Ethernet cable or simply reconnecting your wireless will cause CiscoVPN to loose track of the network adapters on the system. Considering that CiscoVPN is typically used by telecommuters, this is an astonishing oversight on Cisco's part. The above hack should side-step all of these issues by causing the CiscoVPN to re-initialize. It makes one ask, why couldn't Cisco have just put the restart into their client? Or a better idea would be to not reinvent the wheel and use the existing IPSec VPN support in OSX! Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
EDIT: The <a href="http://www.macworld.com/">MacWorld</a> guys came up with a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/136208/2008/10/ciscovpn.html">simpler way</a> to do the same thing:<br />
<br />
sudo SystemStarter restart CiscoVPN</p>

         <p>This did not work for me.  I've gotten this error ever since I installed the VPN from cisco.  I have the 4.9 version as well.        What else might I need to do?</p>

         <p>Yep, a friend of mine pointed that out and I have since confirmed it. Apple's new security update kills CiscoVPN when using dialup adapters. I don't yet have a work-around though I hear it is an issue with Apple, not Cisco. (I have nothing to back that up) I wish Cisco would just give up and use the standard IPSec VPN that comes with OSX. It would make life much easier. I'll do a blog post when I have something on this.</p>

         <p>A separate issue with the Cisco VPN software and OSX is fixed with the latest Apple Software Update. Apparently a software update around March of 2007 broke the Cisco VPN software's ability to connect though it wouldn't show the "Error 51" that this page talks about. Connections would be attempted and a password was requested but after submitting, the connection would never be established and eventually the Cisco VPN app would time out and go back to the "not connected" state. As of May 2007, Apple has released an update that fixes this issue between Cisco VPN and OSX so now things work again as expected.<br>
<br>
This does not cover the "Error 51" issue from this page but did cause the Cisco VPN software not to connect. If you are having this issue, try running Software Update and make sure you have the latest release and see if that helps.</p>

         <p>Error 51 has just cropped up for me as well (4.9.01 (0030))... it was working fine for a while, then error 51 started and I got around it by disabling airport, but just now it is coming up with error 51 everytime :(<br>
<br>
Have tried reinstalling but to no avail.<br>
<br>
It just started immediately after I installed Missing Sync 6 for Palm OS...</p>

         <p>I had the same issue. Tried everything above to no avail - including a post from another forum recommending to turn off web sharing. I had another mac on the network with an older version of cisco's vpn client and even though it wasn't on, it seemed to interfere when starting this version. So, after installing the client again I went through these steps. <br>
1. turned off the other mac<br>
2. did a command line restart of the vpn client<br>
3. started it up and it worked great!</p>

         <div class="byline">#18 | Monday, September 17, 2007 2:25 PM</div>
         <p>Oh yeah, and for good measure I turned off bluetooth. This may have been the issue, I don't know.</p>

         <h3>Alberto Molina from New York USA</h3>
         <div class="byline">#19 | Wednesday, October 3, 2007 12:45 AM</div>
         <p>I lived with this error for a couple of weeks and resorted, ridiculously, to submitting work to the server via ftp.<br>
<br>
It finally occurred to me maybe I should try repairing file permissions.  Read, Write and execute permissions often get fouled up for some reason on the Mac OSX when new programs are installed.  I've been told many times to repair them regularly using Apple's Disk Utility, which makes this a snap.  But I always forget and of course hadn't run it in some time - frankly in several months.  The last time I ran it was after having headaches due to unexpected behavior in some application or other.<br>
<br>
So finally I put together the concept of unexplaiened behavior with Cisco VPN and file permissions.  It took me about 45 seconds to open Disk Utility and hit repair and wait for it to complete.  I then rebooted the computer and voila - Cisco VPN loaded like it always had before, <a href="http://massmind.com/5460/Using_Cicco_VPN_Client_for_Mac_OSX">no Error 51</a>!<br>

         <div class="byline">#20 | Sunday, October 14, 2007 11:10 AM</div>
         <p>Hmmm...  VPN over dialup still doesn't work me.  I use a Treo700p with MobilStreams USB Modem to connect to the internet when away from a hotspot.  My problem is while VPN works fine with my wired and wireless (802.11g) networks it won't connect when I use a dialup connection. <br>
<br>
The client starts fine and I can click connect but it thinks for a few seconds and then goes back to disconnected (I never get the password challenge popup) <br>
<br>
Does anyone know if the VPN with Dialup issue outlined above was fixed by the update that was mentioned (I wasn't sure if it fixed the error 51 issue or the VPN with Dialup issue)<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help</p>

         <p>John / Pascal: I am hearing reports that OS X 10.5 Leopard is working with Cisco VPN 4.9.01 if you do a clean install of CiscoVPN. I have Loepard on my desktop but not my laptop yet and my desktop is at work so I can't test the VPN. Anybody else have experience one way or another on this?<br>
<br>
By the way, CiscoVPN keeps config files in /etc/opt/cisco-vpn/ so to keep all your configurations, back that directory up and restore it after you re-install CiscoVPN.</p>

         <p>I was able to upgrade to Leopard 10.5 from 10.4.11, install Cisco VPN 4.9.011 (0090) which worked. I then did an update to 10.5.1 and allowed the system to reboot. Cisco VPN is still working fine. I am using it now via a wireless connection to write this. Hope this helps any late adopters of Leopard like me.</p>

         <p>I guess I'm having a different problem.<br>
I can connect to my vpn ok, but then I lose access to the internet. <br>
<br>
I see this in the terminal:<br>
Encryption: 168-bit 3-DES<br>
Authentication: HMAC-MD5<br>
IP Compression: None<br>
NAT passthrough is active on port UDP 4500<br>
Local LAN Access is disabled<br>
<br>
In the client, and in the profile LocalAccessEnabled is true, though.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any suggestions?<br>
<br>
I'm on 10.5.1 and cisco vpn 4.9.01 (0080)<br>
<br>
Thanks!</p>

         <p>VPNClient.app Version 4.6.04 (0061)<br>
on Intel Mac-mini<br>
Same problem but can't fix.<br>
It did work fine with 10.5.1 originally then started producing Error 51. Tried removing and reinstalling and repair permissions to no avail.<br>
<br>
sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoVPN/CiscoVPN restart<br>
produces:<br>
Stopping Cisco Systems VPN Driver<br>
kextunload: unload kext /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext failed<br>
Starting Cisco Systems VPN Driver<br>
extension /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext does not contain code for this architecture<br>
<br>
which seems ridiculous as it worked with Tiger with occasional Error 51s then originally worked with Leopard 10.5.1<br>
<br>
I'll see if I can get my administrator to provide the latest version of VPNClient.</p>

         <p>To Roger McMurtrie,<br />
<br />
your VPN client is very old - and I'm surprised it ran on 10.5.<br />
<br />
You can pull down the 4.9.01 build from MacUpdate.com<br />
<br />

         <p>The above solutions have not worked for me but I found another fix that does work. I get this error all the time and this fix always works for me.<br />
<br />
Access terminal and execute:<br />
<br />
$ ifconfig -a<br />
<br />
Enter password if prompted. Then execute:<br />
<br />
$ sudo ifconfig fw0 down<br />
<br />
You may have to execute the command twice. Not sure why. Launch VPN client again. It should work.<br />
<br />
There is, apparently, a more permanent fix, but I'm a bit nervous to try it. I'm posting it for those of you that are more brave than I. Let me know if it works.<br />
<br />
If you would like to have fw0 disabled on boot, do the following below:<br />
<br />
$ sudo pico /System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoVPN/CiscoVPN<br />
<br />
Then change the StartService() function to the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
StartService ()<br />
{<br />
#disable fw0<br />
/sbin/ifconfig fw0 down<br />
<br />
if [ -d $CISCO_VPN_DIR ]; then<br />
ConsoleMessage "Starting Cisco Systems VPN Driver"<br />
kextload $CISCO_VPN_DIR<br />
fi<br />
}</p>

         <p>This only occurred for me after I ran a software update yesterday.  I'm running 10.5.1.<br />
<br />
I fixed my issue with a combination of both of the most used methods above: verifying the permissions in the disk utility, and then reloading the driver.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that a verify permissions, followed by a reload would do the same thing.</p>

         <p>Cisco really needs to get their act together. Restarting my computer is not something I want to spend my time doing, since I usually put my computer to sleep. Also, it would seem that Cisco is unable to respect conventions of not putting startup items /System/Library/StartupItems. It should be in /Library/StartupItems.</p>

         <p>Hi Everyone,<br />
The infamous Error 51 has reared it's head on my laptop running Leopard multiple times.  It has ALWAYS been fixed by going into Internet Sharing and making sure that ALL ports are UNCHECKED!  Then, once they are all unchecked, disable Internet Sharing and you are good to go.<br />
<br />
There are three things to know:<br />
1.) You need to ENABLE Internet Sharing to uncheck the ports.  Then you can then DISABLE it again.<br />
<br />
2.) For some reason, after upgrades or for no reason whatsoever, my Firewire port will get rechecked.  Don't know why.  It makes no difference if you have Internet Sharing enabled or disabled, if anything is checked, Cisco VPN simply will not work and will give you the "Error 51:Unable to Connect with the VPN Subsystem..."<br />
<br />
3.) Even if you disable the blasted ports...they seem to switch right back on sometimes.  You can check before exiting the preferences by simply highlighting some other sharing option then re-highlighting the Internet Sharing option.  Last night I got an email from a user with this Error problem, so in the process of making some screenshots, I encountered this "sticky" setting.  Just wow...what are the odds?   I would uncheck it, exit preferences, then go back in and some danged port would be re-checked again.  I rebuild disk permissions and rebooted, the problem went away and I was able to uncheck the Internet Sharing over Firewire port option and everything worked fine.</p>

         <p>HI Guys,<br />
The best advice is to download the last version of the software in macupdate if you really want to work with 10.5 (Leopard).<br />
I had that problem that tried most of the advises posted here. None of them worked at all. I got the last version and imported the .pcf file and .. Voila it's working.<br />

         <p>Another thing to check - make sure you do not have multiple network interfaces active. For example, if you are using a wired connection, then disable your wireless connection using "Turn AirPort Off".<br />
<br />
Then restart CiscoVPN as above, and it may work.</p>

         <p>Hi eveyone, this is by far the most knowledgeable set of posts about Cisco VPN on OS X, and  I'm hoping you can provide me with some suggestions on running a Cisco VPN on OS X.  <br />
<br />
I've thankfully not had any of the problems noted in this blog post.  I have full access to our internal network, web browsing etc.  However, I'm trying to run Oracle's jDeveloper (and the embedded OC4J) from home while connected to the VPN, and not having much luck.  <br />
<br />
The OC4J is acting as a "provider" for the Oracle Portal Shell that runs on our internal network, and that machine is not able to send messages to my Mac.  I'm giving the Cient IP address provided in the Cisco VPN --&gt; Status --&gt; Statistics to both the Oracle Portal to "register" the provider, as well as to the OC4J instance running inside of jDeveloper.  But no luck; my gut is telling me that the traffic on that Client IP address is not getting to/from my MacBook.  Does anyone have any ideas?  <br />
<br />
I'm running on a NetGear wireless router, which I guess could also be causing problems?  Anyways, any help at is greatly appreciated.</p>

         <p>I have to restart Cisco VPN all the time - so I already knew your tip. I have a shortcut that does it ;)<br />
<br />
Another tip if you want to use Cisco VPN over a PPP connection: Shut down vmware and parallels. Disable all Parallels network adapters in the network preferences.<br />
<br />
For VMWare not sure this is still an issue with VMWare 2.0 but the older version I just shut down like this:<br />
sudo "/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/boot.sh" --stop<br />
<br />
When you need VMWare, you have to re-enable it like this:<br />
sudo "/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/boot.sh" --start<br />
<br />

         <p>I had a very stubborn case of "error 51" after I purchased a new IMAC and my files were transferred from another IMAC. After getting nowhere with my IT person, Apple and Cisco, I somehow noticed in my finder window a "Devices" folder that had been opened out so I could see the sub folders. In it was the FULL version of CiscoVPNClient circa Nov. 2007. It had a Resources and Profiles folder. I clicked on it, it installed and I now can use VPN! I think what was in my Applications folder was an Alias, and perhaps "error 51" means the application is missing parts?<br />
Anyway, for those of you who have exhausted all your resources, try looking in the Devices area of your Leopard OS (in the finder window) to see the full version of VPN. First repair your permissions (with utility), then install, who knows it may work like it did with me?</p>

         <p>Gavin: Looks like you have module version problems. You might have a newer version partially installed over an older one. Try a fresh re-install and see if you still have that issue.</p>

         <p>Hi Anders,<br />
  Yes, I dragged the old version from Apps to the trash, emptied it, then installed from a newer version from a dmg (I did this twice), and am trying to run it from Apps.  I don't know what you mean by fresh re-install. Does that mean trash, then repair permissions, then install? Is their a cleaner way to delete?</p>

         <h3>Anders from RTP</h3>
         <div class="byline">#116 | Wednesday, October 8, 2008 9:55 AM</div>
         <p>Gavin: There is more to the Cisco VPN Client than the app in the Applications folder. (specifically, the directory /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext) Delete the Application and then go through your entire filesystem and delete anything having to do with CiscoVPN as well. Then reboot so you are sure nothing CiscoVPN related is resident in memory (it seems from your debug output that the module didn't unload for some reason either) and do a fresh re-install. If all else fails, you may need to reinstall your OS though I've never heard of things getting so corrupted that this is necessary.</p>

         <p>I recently launched openvpn server for remote clients. I did it because of 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Multiple clients are not allowed from the same IP address with Cisco EasyVPN client.<br />
<br />
2) Cisco EasyVPN client is not stable on Vista an does not exist for Vista 64 at all.<br />
<br />
I am very happy with how openvpn works - it is stable, fast and easy. I recommend it to everyone!</p>

         <p>just to add my $.02, in case it helps anyone:<br />
<br />
I have never, before yesterday, used VPN, total newbie here. My client's server tech set me up with Cisco VPN Client v4.9.01 (8080). Installed (coupla times) on my G5, consistently failed w/error 51. We didn't make any effort to resolve, opting instead to try again on my MBP, which is wirelessly connected to my router (only these two machines in the LAN) and succeeded. As my preference is to use the VPN on my G5, I searched briefly and found this page (thank you all!). I tried several things mentioned above but not the solution which apparently helped many of you using Leopard - both my machines are running Tiger.<br />
<br />
I did however confirm that my internet sharing was disabled which didn't help (I'd already tried repairing permissions and restarting) but then I stopped Personal File Sharing, Personal Web Sharing and FTP Access, and then succeeded w/VPN Client. I quit VPN, then enabled each service and restarted VPN, to see which service was the apparent cause but I was able to re-enable ALL of them and still the VPN Client succeeded in running and connecting. In other words, I simply turned the services off and on, and that somehow allowed VPN Client to connect and re-connect subsequently with my required services running.</p>

         <p>I was pulling my hair out with this Error 51 on a fresh install of 10.5.5 and VPN 4.9.01 (0100).<br />
<br />
Through googling, I realized I overlooked a stupid issue that I introduced. I was using Little Snitch for network connection management, and even though I had no rules blocking the Cisco VPN client, as soon as I added a rule allowing the Cisco VPN client to access everything....BAM!...my VPN worked straight away.<br />
<br />
Just something to keep in mind...</p>

I checked my updates as well...the only thing that helps is a second installation and a restart. this is very annoying, but I cannot switch to another programm as u can only connect to my university net by using CiscoVPN...even the specialists around here from the computer center cannot fix the problem...I'm kind of desperate!!

         <p>So i fixed the problem: (Running Mac OS X 10.4.11)<br />
<br />
First i uninstalled current version with:<br />
terminal:<br />
sudo /usr/local/bin/vpn_uninstall<br />
(admin password required)<br />
<br />
Install newest version:<br />
http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/10317<br />
<br />
Then i get this fucking error... error 51: bla bla<br />
<br />
fixed it with: sudo ifconfig fw0 down<br />
(password required)<br />
<br />
but this only works until restart then i get the same error until i do it again.<br />
<br />
Here the permanet fix:<br />
<br />
$ sudo pico /System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoVPN/CiscoVPN<br />
<br />
Then change the StartService() function to the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
StartService ()<br />
{<br />
#disable fw0<br />
/sbin/ifconfig fw0 down<br />
<br />
if [ -d $CISCO_VPN_DIR ]; then<br />
ConsoleMessage "Starting Cisco Systems VPN Driver"<br />
kextload $CISCO_VPN_DIR<br />
fi<br />
}<br />
<br />
Press ctrl-x and enter to save...<br />
<br />
After the next restart the problem was away...<br />
<br />
I hope i helped some people.<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />
<br />
Flo<br />
<br />
PS: But i didn't use the cisco vpn client... there is a program named shimo, that is much better, and easier to handle. I connect to my cisco-vpn-profile only by pressing "apple+shift+v" and if you want you can connect automatic if you connect to a certain wlan.<br />
<br />

(If you need cisco-vpn-profiles, you have to install cisco-vpn-client first, otherwise it won't run!)</p>

         <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I had the similar problem. But restarting vpn didn't worked. I went to terminal and ran this command<br />
&gt; /usr/local/bin/vpnclient stat<br />
This told me that 'nobody' user is missing. From system preferences, I created a new user and named it 'nobody' and vpn started working again.</p>

sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext<br />

         <p>Dan H: great work--I wish I would have started this thread from the bottom up! <br />
<br />
In case anyone sees this as well, what caused the problem was the CiscoVPN.kext file corrupted, probably either on install of Snow Leopard, or update of a security patch to it--probably the latter, because I believe I used my VPN after Snow Leopard install but before security patch from last week.<br />

Great suggestions but I am running Leopard 10.5.8 and I tried to follow some of the suggestions mentioned above. Here is what I get:<br />
Stopping Cisco Systems VPN Driver<br />
kextunload: unload kext /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext failed<br />
Starting Cisco Systems VPN Driver<br />
extension /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext does not contain code for this architecture<br />

I don't understand what this is and am not sure what to do now...any suggestions?<br />

         <p>I'm running Snow Leopard now and the previous "restart" method doesn't work anymore; there's no such program as "/System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoVPN/CiscoVPN".  However, I did find that simply loading the kernel extension seemed to work fine:<br />
"sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext"<br />
Then I was able to run VPNClient with no problems.</p>

         <div class="byline">#172 | Saturday, February 6, 2010 1:06 AM</div>
         <p>The reason why Cisco cant put restart into the client is because of the structure of the Mac OS X and they had to do this as a kernel extension so it runs on a much lower level than normal Mac OS applications. if Apple allowed more control and not be so tight ass and then justify it by saying they are making a stable OS (which is BS, guest account disaster on 10.6??), Cisco might be able to make a better client. Be thankful they even bothered to make it for Mac.</p>

         <div class="byline">#173 | Saturday, February 6, 2010 8:03 AM</div>
         <p>Rabbid: In my opinion, that's not a good rationale for writing bad software. It might make more sense for Cisco to have used the native IPSec implementation in Mac OSX. I'm sure there is a good reason somewhere but there is probably a good compromise that could be worked out where this sort of thing won't be an issue. Even if Cisco's VPN client were essentially a shell script which unloads then reloads the ktext and then starts the client, that would be better.</p>

For good measure I downloaded and installed, after sticking my old version in an "old" folder (did you know Cisco blocks changing the name of this application?) the newer version 4.9.01.0180 from the mirror site mentioned above. The Cisco site requires a userID and password even to update your version; thank goodness for mirror sites.</p>

since I had to warmstart my system when I was working with the admin account, my VPN Client (Cisco) doesnt work anymore when working with another user account.<br />
<br />
I deinstalled and reinstalled the VPN-Client, repaired the rights, repaired the volume, used the sudo-commands in the terminal (of which 2 kinds can be found in the net), but nothing doesnt work. Funny is, when working with my admin account, the VPN client works. When using another user account it doesnt. "Unable to communicate..."<br />
<br />
I also deactivated the LittleSnitch Firewall and the Sophos Antivirus. But nothing seems to work...<br />
<br />
I would be very glad, if someone has suggestions what to do. Thanks!</p>

         <p>After trying just about everything on this page to get rid of error 51, this is what I realized.  In the console I get "Could not attach to driver.  Is kernel module loaded?" from Cisco.  So definitely a kext issue.  Well as it turns out its an architecture issue, because using kextutil told me that the compiled code does not support x86_64 architecture.<br />
<br />
So why was this working on my laptop but not my MacPro?  Because on the MBP SL boots into 32-bit by default, but the default is to boot into the 64-bit kernel on a MacPro.  So I restarted the MacPro into the 32-bit kernel (hold 3 and 2 when restarting) and all was working well.  <br />
<br />
Side Effect: I did lose my mouse and trackpad however (both bluetooth), but I was able to screen share using the MBP to get those to reconnect from the bluetooth icon.<br />
<br />
I'm not happy that whenever I VPN I have to reboot into 32 bit mode, but luckily I don't need to do that often from the MacPro.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some of the folks out there who weren't able to make this work using the solutions posted here.</p>

         <p>As a quick follow up post.  On SL-64 bit kernel, I used the Apple VPN to connect.  I have a PCF file from the IT people and use RSA SecurId.  If you're in the same boat, you can open the PCF in textedit and copy the group name and password.  If the group password is encrypted, copy the enc password and paste it into: <a href="http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode">http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode</a> and you will get the decoded password.<br />
<br />
This worked beautifully, I am now booted into the 64-bit kernel and VPN-ing without Cisco's klugey code.</p>

         <p>I tried following the instructions and inside Terminal i get the error /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) requested architecture/executable not found; check the system/kernel logs for errors or try kextutil(8). <br />
This is my first Mac and i've not had it long. Thanks</p>

         <p>There is a good chance you have a 64 bit machine. Cisco's VPN client is written for the 32 bit architecture. Try creating a native VPN connection:<br />

<br />
What is the output of this command on your machine: (in Terminal)<br />
<br />
find /* -iname "*cisco*.kext"<br />
<br />
This will take some time to complete as it will return a listing of all files with CiscoVPN in the title. It is possible that the name of the .kext changed. If the above doesn't find it, try:<br />
<br />
find /* -iname "*cisco*"<br />
<br />

         <p>We've noticed on the SandyBridge macs (the ones with Thunderbolt) even the newest VPN client wont start -- just gives the error 51. Our only workaround was to use the native VPN connection.<br />
<br />
Likely have to wait for an update from Cisco for the client to work -- means I need to update documentation for our users!</p>

         <p>Hey, for those that can not use the Snow Leopard VPN to work or are having issues with terminal, I used this this and it worked for me.<br />
<br />
Apparently this can be a problem with any mac using a 64 bit kernel. These were the instructions that I followed that resolved the error<br />
<br />
"In my case it happened if running the 64-bit kernel (see this Apple support article if you're not sure how to check it).<br />
<br />
Here is a Cisco support document that states:<br />
<br />
The Cisco IPSec cliet for Mac OS X does not support the 64 bit kernel. The VPN driver only has i386 and PPC extensions, not x86_64 extensions.<br />
<br />
The solution:<br />
<br />
hold 3 and 2 simultaneously during startup to boot using the 32-bit kernel (link to Apple support article). The Cisco VPN client should open and function just fine now."<br />

<br />
I ran into the "argument missing: error 51: unable to communicate with the vpn subsystem" this morning... tried the suggestion by the MacWorld guys and it crashed the OS, had to push-and-hold.  However, after getting the system back up, the client worked again.<br />
<br />
Also, tried the native VPN connection, and unlike the article, there is no IPSec or Cisco choice under "VPN Type".<br />
<br />
It would be handy to note which versions of MacOS each of the commands or suggestions pertain to.  I know now that I shouldn't use any of the MacWorld suggestions, as they either don't work or will crash my OS.  :)  To be fair, I didn't try suggestion 1 or 2, though...</p>

<br />
I have now switched to native, since the Cisco client never worked for me on Lion.<br />
<br />
Now, I see a successful connect, authentication and IP address, even the banner message, but almost immediately after that, the VPN disconnects!<br />
<br />
The kernel log says something about SIOCPROTODETACH_IN6: utun0 error=6 and the system log says IPSec Controller: IKE FAILED. phase 5, assert 0<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how I can resolve this immediate disconnect?<br />

         <p>@Allen This is a very unusual error. It looks like your VPN server is asking your Mac to use the IP address "111.22.333.444" which is not a legal address (each number needs to be between 0 and 255 exclusive) so I'm guessing this is causing the Mac's IPSec client to bail. Send your logs to the VPN server's administrator and have them check that for you.</p>

         <p>all you having trouble to reset the VPN make sure you're not running in 64 bit mode. It will not work, at least that's my experience and it seems that 64 bit is not supported for os x. so try to set it to 32 bit mode. believe you can reboot and hold don they keys 3 and 2 for 32 bit and 6 and 4 for 64 bit.</p>

         <p>For those still having issues with running the Cisco VPN client with Mountain Lion 10.8, it looks like it's because ML 10.8 defaults to 64bit.<br />
<br />
run: sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386<br />
<br />
This will switch your OS to 32bit, which is compatible with Cisco VPN Client.<br />
<br />
If you find that certain programs are experiencing issues with 32bit, run the same sudo command above except with x84_64 instead of i386</p>
