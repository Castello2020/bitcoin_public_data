</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/associated-press-and-new-york-daily-news-were-fooled-parody-twitter-account/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-22T13:20:46-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/associated-press-and-new-york-daily-news-were-fooled-parody-twitter-account/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/mysterious-white-flags-fly-atop-brooklyn-bridge/"&gt;This morning, New Yorkers woke up to find that the two American flags atop of the Brooklyn Bridge had been mysteriously replaced with a white flags. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, no one knows who did it, or why. Which is actually nice. I like that, for a few hours at least, New York City has an actual mystery. It makes today feel like a Donald Barthelme story, instead of just a Tuesday in July. Which isn't to say the flags haven't unnerved some people, ("If a person could change a flag on top of the bridge, well they could.. they could..."). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, on Twitter, a parody account called &lt;a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/BicycleLobby"&gt;@&lt;span&gt;BicycleLobby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; made a joke about having put the flags up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Earlier today we hoisted two white flags to signal our complete surrender of the Brooklyn Bridge bicycle path to pedestrians.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;mdash; Bike Lobby (@BicycleLobby) &amp;lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BicycleLobby/statuses/491590676816363520"&amp;gt;July 22, 2014&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/BicycleLobby"&gt;@&lt;span&gt;BicycleLobby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a joke, and not even a particularly subtle one. It's devoted to the (fake) idea that there is a Freemason-style group of cycling advocates who control the world. &lt;a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/BicycleLobby"&gt;@&lt;span&gt;BicycleLobby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s Twitter bio &lt;em&gt;identifies it as a parody account, &lt;/em&gt;but in case it didn't, the larger context of its existing tweets certainly scream parody. And yet,&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/american-flags-stolen-atop-brooklyn-bridge-cops-article-1.1875673"&gt; the Daily News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BtKgzAAIUAAIVZY.png:large"&gt;the AP reported&lt;/a&gt; straightfacedly that cycling advocates are taking credit for the flag change. The Daily News story is bylined with three different reporters' names, none of which, apparently, are digital natives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh. As someone who sits on the internet all day, you never want to make fun of anyone too badly for falling for a hoax, because you know that your day will come too. But this one -- this one is very silly. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/someone-epa-really-likes-kim-kardashians-new-iphone-game/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-22T11:00:51-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/someone-epa-really-likes-kim-kardashians-new-iphone-game/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oops. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;Late last night, the official Twitter account for the Environmental Protection Agency accidentally tweeted an excited proclamation about their success in the Kim Kardashian's new mobile game, which invites you to "create your own celebrity and rise to fame and fortune!" &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;Apps of all kinds - not just games - often try to automatically tweet these sorts of tweets because they're free word-of-mouth promotion of the app to the user's social network. Presumably, what happened here was that the social media manager at the EPA was using the EPA's account from their personal phone, and failed to notice that they'd given Kim Kardashian: Hollywood permission to unhumbly brag about their ascension of the virtual social ladder. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;There's not much of a bigger idea here, which is OK! Sometimes it's funny when an institution that's supposed to seem buttoned-up and humane accidentally stumbles and gives you a glimpse of the human beings behind the curtain. To their credit, the EPA seems to be handling their mini-gaffe in stride. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoops…our bad. Sorry about tweet. Upside - more attention for the Office of Water (&lt;a href="http://t.co/GhuYcpwqwx"&gt;http://t.co/GhuYcpwqwx&lt;/a&gt;), thanks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KimKardashian"&gt;@KimKardashian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/amazon-launches-kindle-unlimited-netflix-ebooks/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-18T10:49:00-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/amazon-launches-kindle-unlimited-netflix-ebooks/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;*Version*=1&amp;amp;*entries*=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=9578129011&amp;amp;pfShowFeatures="&gt;Amazon launched Kindle Unlimited today, a service that allows you to pay a flat $9.99 per month in exchange for unlimited eBook downloads.  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="411" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rCChiNT14KY" width="600"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what's the catch? Mainly just that the selection doesn't seem to be great so far. Amazon says there's over 600,000 titles in the service, and the video trailer for the service highlights what some prominent ones -- Harry Potter, the new Michael Lewis book, Lord of the Rings. But I'm a fairly avid eBook person, and when I plugged in the last six eBook novels I read, none of them were a part of Kindle Unlimited. My tastes aren't especially obscure, either -- pretty mainstream literary fiction and detective novels. Judging by my (unbelievably non-scientific) test, Kindle Unlimited's selection of books I'd actually want to read is about on par with an airport bookstore.They've got some of the bestsellers, plus a lot of stuff you never wanted to read but might pick up because it's there. Although at 10 bucks a month, maybe that's good enough for people to try it anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other catch is the perennial Big Catch when it comes to anything Amazon-related: is the convenience worth the longterm damage the service might do to publishing? Their 50-second launch video is all hopeful chimey music and folded up books sailing on a paper ocean. I love a good paper ocean, and I love anything that makes it easier for me to read more things. But Amazon's long brawl with publishers makes me worry that using their new service could hurt the books I like in the long term. I wish, as part of the announcement, Amazon had been more explicit about how the service will profit writers and their publishers. Maybe that's a hopelessly wonky curiousity, but I doubt I'm the only person who's wondering. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/grad-students-pursue-perfect-gif/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-10T13:43:27-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/grad-students-pursue-perfect-gif/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gifgif.media.mit.edu/"&gt;GIFGIF is a project from the MIT Media Lab designed to find the perfect GIF for all of our core online emotions. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GIFGIF offers you, the user, two GIF's that are both supposed to represent, say, "ANGER,"You choose which one (if either) best represents that feeling. The GIF's are scored and then ranked according to the crowd's votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can see what a large group of people have agreed is the platonic GIF ideal of "EMBARRASSMENT"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="http://www.wnyc.org/i/500/316/l/80/1/embarassmentt_1.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or "PRIDE." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="http://www.wnyc.org/i/426/240/l/80/1/pride_2.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;Or "AMUSEMENT."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="http://www.wnyc.org/i/400/226/l/80/1/amusement_2.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You can also see some of the also-rans in each category.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two mildly competing ideas come to mind surveying GIFGIF. One is that, obviously, you can't really rate one GIF as objectively the best GIF. The most popular GIFs for any emotion usually rely on a pop culture reference (Jason Segal, Elie Kemper), and recognizing those references is an audience-specific phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Dad has no idea who Jason Segal is, so his platonic GIF for amusement would probably be &lt;a href="https://14kphillies.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/1982-topps-schmidt-front.jpg"&gt;a close-up of Mike Schmidt or something.&lt;/a&gt; And yet, while GIF's are subjective, they're not entirely so. Some GIFs do feel intrinsically more right than others -- choosing the right GIF feels similar, dopamine-wise, to choosing the right word in a sentence. Which probably points to what this project really is -- a v]isual slang dictionary, albeit one where a lot of the words are just various iterations of Jennifer Lawrence's face. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/upside-npr-diverse-tweet/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-09T09:12:16-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/upside-npr-diverse-tweet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On July 2nd, NPR education blogger Anya Kamenetz landed in hot water for the following tweet: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reach out to diverse sources on deadline. Only the white guys get back to me :(&lt;/p&gt;
— NPR's Education Team (@npr_ed) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/npr_ed/statuses/484365208983318528"&gt;July 2, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script type="mce-no/type" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://alldigitocracy.org/npr-education-team-only-white-sources-return-calls/"&gt;Since then, Kamenetz has apologized&lt;/a&gt;, and yesterday, &lt;a href="http://jimromenesko.com/2014/07/08/npr-memo-warns-about-social-media-posts/"&gt;NPR's Mark Memmott issued a response memo to NPR staff&lt;/a&gt;. Here's an excerpt: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you wouldn’t say it on the air, don’t say it on the Web.” That’s been the basic guidance for quite a few years. In reality, Twitter and other social media sites allow us to show more of our personalities than we might on the air or in a blog post. BUT, though the words may be on “personal” Twitter or Facebook accounts, what we say can reflect on NPR and raise questions about our ability to be objective. Matt Thompson offers a test. Before posting something about your work or a news event or an issue, even if you’re putting it on what you think of as a personal page, ask this question: “Is it helping my journalism, or is it hurting my journalism?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first, to be clear, Kamenetz's tweet was bad. It expressed a stupid thought that hurt her and her employer's credibility.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But surprisingly, I think this dumb tweet actually passes the test Memmott proposes: it probably helped her journalism more than it hurt it. Kamenetz had a stupid thought -- that her lack of deep relationships with non-white sources reflected on those sources, rather than on her journalism. She aired her thought in public. People corrected her. She changed her thinking. That's actually how social media is supposed to work for reporters. It's not just a place where you broadcast your stories to a grateful audience, never embarrassing your employer or yourself. It's a place where you can also think out loud and get feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/30/diversity-npr-tell-me-more_n_5544122.html"&gt;NPR has a diversity problem&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the many drawbacks of that is that reporters are less likely to have their own limited perspectives challenged. The only solution to that problem is more diverse newsrooms and more diverse shows. In the meantime though, I'm in favor of dumb assumptions being corrected in public, rather than quietly infecting NPR's reporting. Memmott's directive was "&lt;span&gt;If you wouldn’t say it on the air, don’t say it on the Web." But because Kamenetz &lt;/span&gt;said a dumb thing on the web, she'll now say smarter things on the air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to be a distraction to the team as the political attacks have shifted towards being personal towards me.&lt;/p&gt;
— Ben Tribbett (@notlarrysabato) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/notlarrysabato/statuses/486341214686298112"&gt;July 8, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribbet's&lt;a href="http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/07/nasty-tweets-redskins-and-ben-tribbett-dont-want-you-read-155688"&gt; resignation came after these tweets of his from 2010 resurfaced.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An older native american guy just accused me of cheating and pulled some stuff out of his pocket to put some kind of spell on me. Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
— Ben Tribbett (@notlarrysabato) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/notlarrysabato/statuses/17097319644139520"&gt;December 21, 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100 into 500. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cursefail?src=hash"&gt;#cursefail&lt;/a&gt; http://plixi.com/p/64343315&lt;/p&gt;
— Ben Tribbett (@notlarrysabato) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/notlarrysabato/statuses/17104125997088768"&gt;December 21, 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just took Chief for his last 300. I'd call it a scalping but that seems uncalled for.&lt;/p&gt;
— Ben Tribbett (@notlarrysabato) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/notlarrysabato/statuses/17107727134228480"&gt;December 21, 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tribbett's resignation was sufficiently vaguely worded that it's possible he's not resigning solely because of these tweets. Last week, for instance, &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/redskins"&gt;Buzzfeed's Evan McMorris-Santoro pointed out that Tribbett, in a previous life&lt;/a&gt;, had convinced America that Republican politician George Allen's use of the word 'macaca' represented an instance of career-ending racism. Stories about Tribbett's selective understanding of what constitutes racism could also be part of the 'distraction' his resignation refers to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, assuming Tribbett has left his job because of the 2010 tweets, it's hard not to marvel at the irony of it. He got hired to defend a football team's racially offensive name. He's resigned after using racially offensive language. It feels like the same logic that caused him to lose his job should have stopped his job from existing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Tribbett did not immediately respond to a request for comment, will update if we hear back from him.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...in my blog, only one individual is named. He is Stan O'Neal, the former boss of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My column describes how O'Neal was forced out of Merrill after the investment bank suffered colossal losses on reckless investments it had made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people would argue that it is highly relevant for the track record, good or bad, of a business leader to remain on the public record - especially someone widely seen as having played an important role in the worst financial crisis in living memory (Merrill went to the brink of collapse the following year, and was rescued by Bank of America).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is unhappy with the law, and their unhappiness comes through in their implementation of it. Initially, Google had set it up so that if you searched for a person about whom material had been censored, you'd get a notice telling you that there was something you weren't seeing. The EU regulators didn't like that, since it seemed to be counter to the spirit of the law. Now, instead, nearly any search for a human on European Google comes affixed with a warning that results may be censored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as absurd as these laws are, they're also broken. Anyone in Europe can just choose to use Google.com (America's version of Google) and they'll receive free, unfettered access to the information the Right to be Forgotten law censors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, reporters have dug out more details that, frankly, make the ethical foundation for the study seem shakier. For instance, Facebook argued that while the company didn't have explicit consent from its users to conduct the study, a line in their Terms of Service that said users' data could be used for 'research' amounted to consent.&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/28/facebook-manipulated-689003-users-emotions-for-science/"&gt; Forbes' Kashmir Hill found that Facebook actually added that line &lt;em&gt;four months after&lt;/em&gt; the actual study began. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They spell out the joke pretty clearly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention that the fine people of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twitter"&gt;@Twitter&lt;/a&gt; have an egregious grammar problem. I’m here to help. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KelseyGrammerGrammar?src=hash"&gt;#KelseyGrammerGrammar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StoneTired"&gt;@StoneTired&lt;/a&gt;, I’m honored you think so, but believe it should be *it’s. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KelseyGrammerGrammar?src=hash"&gt;#KelseyGrammerGrammar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Kelsey Grammer (@KelseyGrammer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KelseyGrammer/statuses/483675166682009600"&gt;June 30, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, look. I'm not a cynic. If a celebrity wants to suddenly engage in whimsical hijinks on a social network, I'm all for it. But if I WERE some sort of cynic, I might notice that Grammer has a new television show to promote. I might also note that his co-star in the television show has also suddenly ramped up his Twitter activity. And I might choose to abstain from mentioning either the show or the co-star, because the whole endeavor might make feel just slightly used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like a lot of things on the internet -- the social media stunt ends up being disappointing because the thing it's supposed to draw your attention to is less interesting than the stunt itself. Which world would you rather live in? One where a TV actor suddenly becomes an internet grammar obsessive, or one in which another new TV show about lawyers has been made?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, like I said, I am not a cynic. If Mr. Grammer is serious about cleaning up the messy, run-on sentence strewn streets of the Twitterverse, great. And if he continues on his quest, if he commits to the silliness he's started, maybe I'll even watch this lawyer show. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/facebook-emotional-manipulation-study/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-30T08:29:10-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/facebook-emotional-manipulation-study/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, Facebook announced it had conducted an experiment on some of its users without their knowledge or permission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s how it worked. For a short amount of time, one group of users only saw negative posts from their friends in their news feed, while others only saw positive posts. The idea was to test whether moods can be contagious across networks. The researchers believe that the answer is yes, that if suddenly everyone on your Facebook seems to be melancholy, you’re likely to write a slightly sadder post as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of the study spread over the weekend, and now people are very angry at Facebook, enough so that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/akramer/posts/10152987150867796"&gt;the lead researcher on the study has publicly apologized&lt;/a&gt;. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thrust of the objection is that people say that they don’t like to be emotionally manipulated. The problem is, that’s just not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one example. We watch TV just so that professional liars can pretend to be in love, or sad, or scared, because we want to trick our hearts into feeling those things too. And even during that lie that we’re enjoying, there are breaks where advertisers tell us shorter lies, not because they want to entertain us but because they want to manipulate us into buying dumb stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, consent and transparency in these manipulations are important, and Facebook’s experiment contained neither. On the other hand, the manipulations we receive from TV, film, or even a decent web series are so much more effective than what Facebook can do. In his apology, the lead researcher admitted as much:  “…the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it -- the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word, per thousand words, over the following week.” Contrast that with Friday Night Lights, which will make the most emotionally resilient person cry at least once per season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, the more interesting problems with the Facebook study are about academic ethics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there’s the consent problem. You don’t do studies on humans who haven’t given informed consent. (Facebook’s Terms of Service say they might anonymously use your information for “research,” which is a far cry from telling people you might try to make the feel sad for science.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/29/facebook-doesnt-understand-the-fuss-about-its-emotion-manipulation-study/"&gt;And over at Forbes, Kashmir Hill noted &lt;/a&gt;that Facebook didn’t submit the study to a university ethics review board for approval — the company just internally decided the experiment was ethically OK. Bad oversight! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it’s not clear the study was even well designed. &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s Robinson Meyer &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/"&gt;talked to an expert who explained that Facebook’s methodology for telling happy posts form sad ones is fairly crude: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two sample tweets (or status updates) that are not uncommon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am not happy.&lt;br&gt;“I am not having a great day.”&lt;br&gt;An independent rater or judge would rate these two tweets as negative — they’re clearly expressing a negative emotion. That would be +2 on the negative scale, and 0 on the positive scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the LIWC 2007 tool doesn’t see it that way. Instead, it would rate these two tweets as scoring +2 for positive (because of the words “great” and “happy”) and +2 for negative (because of the word “not” in both texts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard not to like this last idea, that Facebook may’ve angered the entire internet over a study that could fundamentally be bunk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essentially means that Amazon can't do in France what it's done in the US -- use books as a loss-leader to sell other products, and use free-shipping and low prices to drive out competitors. The French approach to defending independent bookstores isn't particularly subtle or market-friendly, but it's hard to imagine it won't be effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is completely unfathomable to imagine a law like this passing in the US -- lawmakers deliberately targeting one business, hobbling it on purpose, and the public generally seeming very happy about it (the French law passed unanimously). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other wonderful wrinkle to this is that it puts &lt;a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/colbert-wages-war-amazon/"&gt;Stephen Colbert and France on the same side of the anti-Amazon war&lt;/a&gt; , which is maybe equally unfathomable. We live in a crazy world where crazy things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

Individual spammers can be fined up to $1 million, companies that spam can be fined up to $10 million, &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-anti-spam-law-concerns-small-business-operators-1.2685576" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CBC.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The legislation assuredly won't eradicate spam, and it won't even eradicate spam for Canadians -- after all, the internet is global, so this just means Canadians will be receiving less locally-grown spam. But the law does cramp things up for spammers based in Canada, as well as for any business that sends out legitimate promotional emails that might be mislabeled as spam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, this week, Canadian companies are emailing people asking for consent to be spammed. Which is hilarious and lovely. Friend of TLDR &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/totallyslutsky" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Slutsky&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://sadyoutube.com/" target="_blank"&gt;of Sad YouTube fame&lt;/a&gt;) forwarded a few selections from his inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think it's important to keep in touch by sending useful information that will help you to make financial decisions that are right for you. It's just one of the ways we're making money make sense. &lt;br&gt;Effective July 1, 2014, Canada's new anti-spam law comes into effect and BMO Financial Group wants to ensure that your BMO representative will be able to continue sending you e‑mails and other electronic messages without any interruptions. In addition to messages from your BMO representative, we may also send you other electronic messages, including but not limited to newsletters and surveys as well as information, offers, and promotions regarding our products and services or those of others that we believe you might be interested in ("Electronic Messages"). &lt;br&gt;...Sincerely, BMO Financial Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Film Centre doesn't want to lose you! Canada's new anti-spam legislation requires that we obtain your consent in order for you to continue receiving select electronic communications from the CFC. We would love to continue to share information with you about the CFC's exciting activities, events, programs, promotions and alumni. Please go here to confirm your consent to continue receiving your electronic communications. Without it, we may not be able to continue being connected in this way after July 1st...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the American government, assuming you all are big TLDR readers: please pass this law here. I want every company to have to beg me for consent to be spammed.&lt;/p&gt;

Enough so that there's a &lt;a href="http://tinderguyswithtigers.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"&gt;tumblr that strictly curates pictures of doe-eyed bros cuddling with one of nature's more deadly predators&lt;/a&gt;. Now, New York lawmakers have introduced a law meant to ban tiger-cuddling pictures in New York State. From the &lt;a href="http://nypost.com/2014/06/21/new-law-banning-tiger-photo-ops-could-cramp-tinder-guys-style/" target="_blank"&gt;New York Post:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal explained that she introduced the legislation to increase safety at traveling circuses and county fairs that allow the public to get up close and personal with their big cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Upper West Side Democrat acknowledges proudly that the bill would also destroy a trend now prevalent among users of dating apps — men snuggling with tigers in reckless attempts to look brave or cuddly or, even more implausibly, both in their dating-profile photos on online services like Tinder and OKCupid.  “They can still pose with bears and monkeys,” the assemblywoman said. “They just have to take big cats off their list.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a good chance that all of the people involved in this story -- the men who try to entice women &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_megafauna" target="_blank"&gt;via charismatic megafauna&lt;/a&gt;, the legislators who want to stop them -- spend most of their days preoccupied with less absurd concerns, and that we are just noticing them in an atypically dumb moment. &lt;/p&gt;

Instead, the Foundation settled on requiring transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This rule change is a reaction to a purge last fall, when 250 editor accounts belonging to PR professionals were deleted by Wikipedia editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Of course, the problem of Wikipedia astroturfing is likely to stay with us. As long as Wikipedia is free and open to anyone, they’ll have to police bad actors, and some of them will slip under the radar. Plus, the trickiness of the site’s interface and editing culture means that there’s always going to be people who would like their pages corrected / burnished who don’t have the technical knowhow to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One clear sign of the difficulty of solving this? Wiki-PR, a Wikipedia editing PR company targeted in the Fall ban, &lt;a href="http://wiki-pr.com/pt"&gt;is still open for business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s a forest of forms and hoops to jump through, presumably because politicians get tons of spam and want to make it so that the only people who email them are real humans who have made a dogged attempt to do so. Which is good for their inboxes, but arguably a little wobbly as a democratic idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/06/17/we-finally-gave-congress-email-addresses/"&gt;The Sunlight Foundation just introduced a pretty elegant fix for this. They’ve created email addresses for every member of Congress. &lt;/a&gt;So if you want to email, for instance, Rep. Aaron Shock, &lt;a href="http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/aaron-schock-fitness"&gt;(the fittest member of Congress, according to Men’s Health)&lt;/a&gt; you just email &lt;a href="mailto:Rep_Shock@opencongress.org"&gt;Rep_Shock@opencongress.org&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunlight Foundation will send an email back asking you to confirm you’re a human (as opposed to a spambot) and then they’ll ferry your email through whatever myriad forms exist on Shock’s website so that it reaches his congressional inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The one restriction on the Sunlight Foundation’s site is that they ask you for your zip code up top to try to stop you from emailing a Congressperson besides your own. Here’s the logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A lot of people dislike this. We do, too. In an age of increasing polarization, party discipline means that congressional leaders must be accountable to citizens outside their districts. But the unfortunate truth is that Congress typically won't bother reading messages from non-constituents — that's why those zip code requirements exist in the first place. Until that changes, we don't want our users to waste their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140617/14301127606/sunlight-foundation-gives-congress-email-addresses.shtml"&gt;(via Techdirt)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/shrturl-hoax-news-generator-has-shut-down/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-17T10:45:33-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/shrturl-hoax-news-generator-has-shut-down/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/beware-shrturl-tool-which-makes-it-very-very-easy-create-hoax-versions-real-websites/" target="_blank"&gt;Last month, we talked about SHRTURL, a website that makes it easy for people to create fake news articles that look like they've come from reputable websites.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, Alexander Griffioen (SHRTURL's creator) has announced that he's shutting it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Griffioen says he was unnerved by people using his lie-generating tool to generate lies that he thought were vicious -- like, for instance, a death rumor about Formula One racer Michael Schumacher. If you've been on the internet say, twice, it's not incredibly surprising that people would use a hoax tool to spread death hoaxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Griffioen also says that he'll sell the site to anyone who makes him a good enough offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, life is short, and I'm not sure I want to spend much time being outraged by someone trying to profit off of internet lies. Or being baldly disingenuous. But the upshot of all this is that there's one less hoax factory in production, at least for now. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/250-new-emojis-announced/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-17T09:47:42-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/250-new-emojis-announced/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="http://emojipedia.org/new-emoji/"&gt;The Unicode Consortium released two hundred fifty new emoji yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Despite seemingly universal consensus that emoji characters ought to include more racial diversity, this new set doesn’t add very much at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That disappointment aside, here’s something sort of great about this new release. Every year, the various traditional dictionaries add new tech words to their lexicon (“&lt;em&gt;Did you hear that Merriam-Webster will include ‘selfie’ now?&lt;/em&gt;”) and everyone feels justifiably embarrassed about the squareness of it all. Part of what makes those stories feel silly is that the dictionaries are granting internet slang an official imprimatur that it doesn’t need and didn’t ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Emoji language updates are the exact opposite of that. The charm of Emoji is that rather than giving us words or symbols to describe our experience, it gives us a bunch of mostly random pictographs, and we have to invent ways to use them in a way that makes meaning. Emoji’s charm is in how broken and inadequate it is. So while it truly sucks that these new Emoji are mostly as lily white as the ones we already had, I am excited to see how people make use of “Derelict House Building” “Heart With Tip On The Left” and “Notched Right Semicircle With Three Dots” Nobody asked for these symbols, but we’ll figure out what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. The reason that the Unicode Consoritum gets to decide what Emojis we’ll have (rather than say, our phone company) is that they’re responsible for maintaining a standard that will work across all the different operating systems. If Apple went rogue and added new Emoji on their own, those symbols wouldn’t necessarily display on an Android phone. That’s why Emoji change happens at such a glacial pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saved You A Click has been around for a while, but for whatever reason it seems to be picking up a lot of attention this week. &lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jackshafer/" target="_blank"&gt;Jack Schafer wrote approvingly about it&lt;/a&gt;, so did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/474529698035548160" target="_blank"&gt;First Look's Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not surprising that the people who seem to love this account best are journalists. Because of their trade, they're likely to read more stupid headlines than any reasonable person would choose to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, I've held off on writing about @SavedYouAClick because the headlines it's deftly mocking just don't bother me very much. They used to, but at some point, I just decided that any tweet or headline that withheld a piece of information was probably doing so because the reveal just wasn't that surprising. And so now my brain processes those tweets the way it processes sponsored content or dubious 'related links.' It filters them out.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention that not SOLELY to brag, in a narrow and pathetic way, about my clickbait digesting sophistication, but also to suggest that you can usually choose to ignore most of what is harmlessly annoying. Either by skipping over it, or by unsubscribing from the feeds that bother you. And if you can't do either of those things (perhaps you have lobster claws for hands, and clicking unfollow is just too onerous) making fun of garbage is always a pretty fine alternate option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's like inviting a few thousand people on the internet to circle around you and chant "DO IT! DO IT!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been talking about it in the office because last Friday (which was a slow Friday) stumbled upon a high schooler who was promising to throw a water balloon during is high school lunch if he got 10 retweets. We retweeted him, curious to see what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 RT's and ill launch this into the cafeteria &lt;a href="http://t.co/5pLF3FS8Ua"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5pLF3FS8Ua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He got the 10 retweets he wanted, but no water balloon ever flew. Which is almost certainly for the best. But it made me wonder if anyone ever follows through on these kinds of dares. After all, it's not like there's accountability. So I went in search of someone who had gotten their retweets and done what they said they'd do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5000 RTS AND EVERYBODY PASSES FINAL !! RETWEETTTTTTTTT PLEASE &lt;a href="http://t.co/xY2KrAi11s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xY2KrAi11s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found MIRANDA△ online, and here is our short interview. I'm posting it without any real editing, so please forgive my glaring factual error in the second sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Hi! I'm a reporter and I saw the tweet you did (awhile ago?) trying to get 5000 retweets to get your final canceled. Did it work? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. It was to all pass with a C or higher and yes we did she scaled the final exams for us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q. How long did it take to get 5,000? What made it take off?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. We actually got it within 12 hours and I think once it reached like the hype time between 7-9 that day everybody just started retweeting it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q. Why did your teacher agree to do it? Do you think that she just didn't think you could get 5,000?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Well we were all seniors and we thought it would be interesting to see if we could get it she was actually really surprised. And we took a survey on if we would of tweeted something different maybe we would of had more positive responses to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q. It's hard to imagine that anything would've done better than 5,300 or whatever it got. Did you guys ever try to do anything else like that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. I think it just stopped because it reached it's goal, maybe if it had a greater goal it would've kept going. And no none of us tried..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q. Cool. And do you have a zillion twitter followers from that tweet? Or unrelated?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;span&gt;I gained about 2000 from the tweet but that's it Lol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Q. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wow. So wait so how do you have so many followers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Honestly I live in a big city most from that but then a couple famous people followed me and I actually gained a lot from that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q. &lt;span&gt;Hm! Cool. OK. Thank you for letting me ask a bunch of silly questions about a tweet from awhile ago. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it feels weird to post this. I'm worried that the implicit message is "In light of this recent tragedy, here's an old episode of ours to listen to." But it feels worthwhile insofar as it provides context for anyone coming freshly to this story. We're also trying to get ahold of Knudsen for comment. Obviously it's not his fault that disturbed people are alleging that his piece of art influenced them, but we'd just like to hear how he's grappling with this awful thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been looking around for good numbers on what market share is like for ebooks, and they're surprisingly hard to come by. &lt;a href="http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2014/is-apple-now-the-no-2-ebook-retailer-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank"&gt;People seem to think that Amazon has around 60% - 65% of the market&lt;/a&gt;, followed by either Apple or Barnes and Noble, who both seem to hover around 10% each. I'm using hedgey language here because even experts seem to just be making (educated) guesses on all this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one mentions Walmart as any sort of contender. The most accidentally funny thing I read was this line in a Bloomberg piece: &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-30/wal-mart-touts-web-book-sales-amid-amazon-hachette-spat.html" target="_blank"&gt;"[Walmart]...said yesterday that physical book sales on Walmart.com have climbed 70 percent. &lt;em&gt;The company didn’t give a time frame for the gain."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Come on, guys. &lt;/p&gt;

You go to shrturl.co and put in the website you want to change. That site pops up in your browser, and you can rewrite the existing text. Then, you send people the URL, which looks like a generic URL shortener, and they see the site as you edited it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a fun tool for stupid, goofy gchat pranks, but it takes zero imagination to see how someone could use shrturl to start a hoax. So, you know. Caveat Emptor. Or Caveat Browser, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/amazon-says-it-delaying-your-book-orders-better-serve-you/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-28T11:18:56-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/amazon-says-it-delaying-your-book-orders-better-serve-you/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Amazon has been intentionally delaying shipments to customers who order books from the publisher Hachette, because Amazon and Hachette are in a protracted negotiation over prices. Readers and writers are unhappy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Amazon (which tends to be tight-lipped about this sort of thing) &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&amp;amp;cdThread=Tx1UO5T446WM5YY"&gt;released a statement explaining its side of things.&lt;/a&gt; The company framed its tactics as being in the service of customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Negotiating with suppliers for equitable terms and making stocking and assortment decisions based on those terms is one of a bookseller's, or any retailer's, most important jobs. Suppliers get to decide the terms under which they are willing to sell to a retailer. It's reciprocally the right of a retailer to determine whether the terms on offer are acceptable and to stock items accordingly… When we negotiate with suppliers, we are doing so on behalf of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I guess? Of all the ways to defend tactics like these, framing them as customer service feels like the least convincing one. Amazon went on to acknowledge that the fact that this was about books, instead of say, flatscreen TV’s, seemed to matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;p style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This topic has generated a variety of coverage, presumably in part because the negotiation is with a book publisher instead of a supplier of a different type of product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;People care about books, and about Amazon’s near monopoly on their distribution, in a way that’s subjectively different from the infinite array of widgets that Amazon distributes. From the outside, it seems so bizarre and shortsighted for Amazon to remind everyone of its enormous power, and to demonstrate that it’s willing to use it to hurt authors and publishers until they comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;PS. If you want an opposite take on all this, &lt;a href="http://www.thecockeyedpessimist.blogspot.com/2014/05/whos-afraid-of-amazoncom.html"&gt;Amazon linked to this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from a small publisher who's firmly on it's side. He thinks that the Times’ coverage of the fight is shoddy, the big publishers are being crybabies, and that Amazon has been better for his business than the chain store network that it supplanted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As now almost always seems to be the case when a young man murders people, there’s a raft of stories investigating his “digital footprint.” A manifesto that ended up on Scribd, various anti-women postings on misogynist websites, the shooters’ own creepy YouTube screeds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So how much attention should we pay to the thoughts of an insane murderer? I really have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On Twitter, the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YesAllWomen?src=hash" target="_blank"&gt;#YesAllWomen has taken off&lt;/a&gt;, as a place where women are sharing stories about being threatened or abused by men who, like the killer, felt violently entitled to sex. And &lt;a href="http://whenwomenrefuse.tumblr.com" target="_blank"&gt;whenwomenrefuse.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt; is cataloging stories of male violence against women who refused their advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are arguing that it doesn't make sense to talk about motive or causation with a homicidal person: crazy trumps culture. But whether you think that a poisonous anti-woman culture contributed to the killer’s headspace or not, it seems like as good a time as any to talk about the prevalence of that culture, both in real life and online.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/health-inspectors-are-using-yelp-reviews-target-dirty-restaurants/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-23T10:59:30-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/health-inspectors-are-using-yelp-reviews-target-dirty-restaurants/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6320a1.htm?s_cid=mm6320a1_w" target="_blank"&gt;The Center for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;says that NYC health inspectors have been using Yelp reviews to ferret out local restaurants which were giving patrons food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The system is pretty elegant, insofar as you can describe anything used for tracking diarrhea outbreaks as elegant. The inspectors looked for keywords associated with food poisoning. Then, two or more people had to have used those words and reported that a place made them sick. Lastly, the incubation period had to be under 10 hours. If a restaurant met all the criteria, health inspectors would visit to see if something was amiss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only obvious problem that comes to mind is that now that this formula is public, it's gameable by jerks. If you run a pizzeria and want to sabotage your competitors, you now know the formula that merits NY health department attention. But that said -- there's always been an incentive for businesses to trash talk each other on Yelp, so maybe this isn't that big of an additional deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other precendent for this is Google Flu Trends, which promises to use Google searches to map flu outbreaks. &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/in-defense-of-google-flu-trends/359688/" target="_blank"&gt;There's been debate &lt;/a&gt;about how useful Google Flu Trends really is - sometimes it's works, sometimes it doesn't -- but the reasonable takeaway is that both of these represent one more diagnostic tool for the people whose job it is to stop mass epidemics of vomiting. Which seems all to the good. &lt;/p&gt;

Who would decide who gets to be forgotten, and why?) but a few governments have instituted some version of legally mandated forgetfulness, most recently the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the BBC is reporting that the first applicants who'd like material removed from the internet have shown up, and they're archetypal examples of people who you'd want to know (factually correct) bad information about. For instance, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27423527" target="_blank"&gt;a guy who got caught possessing child abuse images.&lt;/a&gt; Or an ex-politician making a comeback who wants an article about his bad behavior in office nixed. Or a &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27439194" target="_blank"&gt;fellow who tried to kill his family.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of Right to be Forgotten laws is that they'll legislatively fix something about the internet that's essentially unfixable - it's a place where gossip and outrage proliferate, whether or not their targets deserve it. But the solution they offer -- for governments to decide which speech is accurate or worthwhile, is a silly one. &lt;/p&gt;

At the time, Nguyen &lt;span&gt;said that the game was too addictive. It was bad for the people who played it, and it's success was bad for him. &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101673850" target="_blank"&gt;Nguyen says that the new version of the game will be less addictive. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really excited to see what that looks like. Video games are the only entertainment I can think of where the term "addictive" is so often deployed as a mostly positive descriptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I'm not confident that when gamers talk about something as addictive they mean it in a pure, DSM-definition way. But if you've ever played a video game that's truly addictive, video game addiction feels like kin to real addiction. There's a need for repetition, a feeling of the world slipping by, of whatever bodily needs you have (to eat, to pee) fading. You get home from work on Friday, shut the door, and don't reappear until Monday morning. Maybe it's a Fisher-Price addiction, but it can feel real enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also games that are wonderful and entertaining and &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;particularly addictive. &lt;a href="http://www.swordandsworcery.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sometimes even explicitly so - the iOS game Swords and Sorcery periodically suggests that you take a break &lt;/a&gt;from playing it. I'm excited to watch someone try to make an addictive video game into something more mild. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/newt-gingrich-will-answer-your-question/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-30T14:49:58-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/newt-gingrich-will-answer-your-question/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newt Gingrich is a panelist on CNN's political debate show Crossfire. Also, he has a funny Twitter tic that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stefanjbecket" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt;'s Stefan Becket&lt;/a&gt; noticed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.wnyc.org/i/raw/1/gingrich.JPG" alt="" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever runs social media for Crossfire is enamored with the engagement strategy of asking lots of rhetorical Yes or No questions on Twitter. And Newt Gingrich is enamored with answering them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to exactly pin down what's so funny about this. Here are the two mental images it conjures for me: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Newt Gingrich, head bowed in some kind of paperwork, while someone just off to his side keeps asking him random topical news questions "Newt! Should Michael Grimm step down from office?" He answers them in a kind of automatic, distracted way and continues tow ork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Newt Gingrich, sitting in a classroom, as a weirdly hyper teacher fires a series of rapid questions. After every one, Newt Gingrich's hand shoots straight up and he answers them confidently. "Class, how would you grade President Obama's foreign policy?" Newt: "FAIL." It's worth mentioning that in this mental image, the classroom is empty, and Newt Gingrich is sitting alone in a sea of desks. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/vigilante-solution-texting-and-driving/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-30T12:30:26-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/vigilante-solution-texting-and-driving/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Florida news affiliate WTSP reports on a man accused of putting a mobile cell phone jammer in his car to stop nearby drivers from distracted driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators say they caught a Seffner man jamming people's cell phones during his commute down I-4. And they're slapping him with the maximum fine allowed by law: $48,000. Agents from the FCC say Jason R. Humphreys admitted to setting up the jammer in his SUV. He would crank it up during his daily drive down Interstate 4 between Seffner and Downtown Tampa, from 2011 to 2013. The 60-year-old man said his goal was to keep drivers around him from talking on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever driven a car or been a pedestrian around cars, it’s hard not to sympathize with Humphreys and &lt;a href="http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ztSKD3hb8NI/UYyCLDvD7LI/AAAAAAABFnI/M9eW1Zz551k/s600/Screen%2520Shot%25202013-05-10%2520at%25203.13.55%2520PM.png" target="_blank"&gt;his somewhat Mr. Burns-esque solution to distracted driving&lt;/a&gt;. There are of course a few problems with his plan to block out everyone else’s cell phone conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, it’s illegal, and the fines are huge. Two, the jammer blocked all nearby communications. That means that a nearby driver wouldn’t have been able to call say, 911 after a c&lt;span&gt;ar accident. And further, emergency personnel who were within the radius of Humphrey’s jammer wouldn’t be able to use their walkie-talkies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/wtsp/pdfs/2014/fcc-14-55a1.pdf." target="_blank"&gt;The full complaint is here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Relevant to the above, OTM once tried to &lt;a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/why-all-weirdest-news-florida/" target="_blank"&gt;solve the mystery of why so much weird news comes from Florida.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/codebabes-worst-thing/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-25T14:24:54-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/codebabes-worst-thing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://codebabes.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Codebabes.com&lt;/a&gt; is one of those things that's so stupid and offensive on its face that you hope it's not real. Who knows, it's so over the top it could in fact be a clumsy parody of sexism in tech, rather than just a highly distilled example of it. Here's what it purports to be: a website that teaches you how to do basic coding via instructional videos led by half-naked, double-entendre spewing women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an excerpt from the core principles: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go fast, each lesson is a quicky, we’re pretty sure you won’t mind re-watching them :), pause it when it gets too fast, or.... ya know, FAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(FAP is internet slang for masturbate. Super charming.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this in a larger context - sexism in tech is a pervasive, endemic problem. &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/" target="_blank"&gt;Most recently, Julie Ann Horvath, a software developer at Github, resigned in protest against what she called a culture of intimidation towards women at the company&lt;/a&gt;. Last September, &lt;a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/business-insider-ctos-is-your-new-tech-bro-nightmare-1280336916" target="_blank"&gt;Pax Dickinson, CTO of Business Insider, resigned after bad press from tweets like this one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Who has more dedication, ambition, and drive? Kobe only raped one girl, Lebron raped an entire city. +1 for Lebron." — Pax Dickinson (@paxdickinson) July 13, 2010"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a culture that repeatedly finds ways to tell women that they're not wanted or welcome, something like Code Babes starts to feel much worse than just juvenile and skeevy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. There's nothing terribly insightful you can say about a repugnant thing being repugnant. Maybe Code Babes will be the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html" target="_blank"&gt;tech world's version of Cliven Bundy&lt;/a&gt; -- an example of someone stating views in such a baldly abhorrent way that they set the outside limit on what kind of speech people will defend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know. If you want something more productive to do with your attention, maybe send it over to &lt;a href="http://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Girls Who Code, a computer immersion science program for young girls&lt;/a&gt; that tries to undo the damage that sites like Code Babes propagate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Alex put an interview request out to the person who appears to have registered Code Babes. We'll let you know if we hear anything from him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSS. &lt;a href="http://ohsnapski.com/2014/04/25/if-we-offended/" target="_blank"&gt;Here's Amanda Levendowski with more context (and numbers!) on how bad the tech industry's problem with women is&lt;/a&gt;. Plus an argument for why we ought to pay attention to this problem, even if Code Babes turns out to be a tone-deaf hoax. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/google-street-view-adds-time-machine-mode/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-23T11:41:56-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/google-street-view-adds-time-machine-mode/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, this is nice. &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/go-back-in-time-with-street-view.html" target="_blank"&gt;Today, Google announced that Street View users will be able to look back at historical images of the streets that Google's photographed. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not available on every single Street View image, but for the ones where it's enabled, you click the small clock icon on the top left of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive goes back to 2007, the year that Street View first began. While that might not seem like ancient history right now, over time it'll mean that there's a record of what our streets looked like every year into the future. Which is pretty cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's essentially how Google suggests people use this new feature - to watch incremental change happen quickly. For instance, you can watch New York's &lt;del&gt;Freedom Tower&lt;/del&gt; One WTC being built:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JkshHMswiI0/U1dI-u7jkqI/AAAAAAAAOZ8/PewY1C8xkW4/s1600/freedom+tower.png" alt="Google" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Or witness the devastation wrought by Japan's 2011 Earthquake:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sG9KAMFu0q4/U1dI-NZMT7I/AAAAAAAAOZ4/GPgxg7mAsXE/s1600/JapanEarthquake.png" alt="Google" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;or me though, the fun of Street View has always been in using it as a floating nostalgia camera. I like virtually walking by the first apartment I lived in, or standing at the edge of the driveway I grew up in. Sometimes, the Street View cameras will catch some glimpse of your actual life, like a locked up bike or a recognizable open window. It's nice to think that those things will be preserved, rather than rolled over as the images are updated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people who have their photo taken with police officers do so in a less friendly context. They’re being arrested, or perhaps violently restrained. So users have begun tweeting out those photos. The hashtag suggested by the NYPD, #myNYPD, is trending nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most of what I like about Twitter. Moreso than Facebook, it’s a place where there’s still the potential, in any interaction, for the crowd to take over the podium. Every day, people in New York have a perfectly friendly interactions with cops. Every day, people in New York have terrible interactions with cops.

</title><link href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/captcha-dead-maybe-sort/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-21T11:57:11-04:00</updated><id>http://www.onthemedia.org/story/captcha-dead-maybe-sort/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;No one particularly loves CAPTCHA's, those tiny boxes that make you type in hard to read pieces of text to prove that you're a human being. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/google-algorithm-busts-captcha-with-99-8-percent-accuracy-7000028537/" target="_blank"&gt;Last week, Google announced an algorithm that can crack CAPTCHA's with 99.8 percent accuracy.&lt;/a&gt; The algorithm was designed for Google Street View -- it's supposed to pluck address numbers out of photos and make sense of them for Google's computers. But a computer that can decode a grainy photo of an address number on a house can also decode a CAPTCHA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens now? Well, just because &lt;span&gt;because CAPTCHA's are theoretically useless, it doesn't mean they'll immediately go away. Spammers would first have to recreate Google's algorithm. And even if and when they do, stray CAPTCHA's could persist. The internet is filled with redundant security theater. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And when these floating text CAPTCHA's are truly gone, we'll need something else - some cheap Turing Test to &lt;/span&gt;separate&lt;span&gt; us from the bots. Whatever that looks like, it's a near-guarantee that it'll be something annoying. Maybe the next generation of CAPTCHA's will ask us to I.D. a picture of Ryan Gosling, or hum a few notes of music into our computer. We'll have to keep finding things we can do but our computers can't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
