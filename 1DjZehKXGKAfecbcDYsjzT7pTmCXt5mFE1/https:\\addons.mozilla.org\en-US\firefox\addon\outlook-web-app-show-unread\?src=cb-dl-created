Version 1.1 Info
November 12, 2013
Released under GNU General Public License, version 3.0 About this Add-on
I found myself annoyed by the Outlook Web App because one has to actually click on the OWA tab to see if you have any messages. With this extension, one can work in other tabs and know if they have any messages waiting for them or not.This extension works with the OWA URL format https://*/owa/*Support the development of this extension via Bitcoin or Dogecoin (for transparency)!Bitcoin: 1DjZehKXGKAfecbcDYsjzT7pTmCXt5mFE1Dogecoin: DPWbVMZespWTk9WVZQ8D5u25EPHvWiDrVn
Version Information
Version 1.1
Released November 12, 2013

Works with
Firefox 1.5 and later Fixes in this version:--Fixed bug that would change the name of any page opened from OWA (new messages, appointments, etc)Updates in this version:--Updated to work with any Outlook Web App with its application URL containing /owa/ or /OWA/--Made it so it will only show the number of unread messages when there are unread messages (when the count is > 0).
