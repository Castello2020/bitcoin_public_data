You can selectively restore only the items you need.  For instance, you may just want your bookmarks restored and leave everything else as it was.

Features:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One click backup from the Toolbar.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Schedule automatic backups on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.  Can also be configured to backup on Firefox startup and/or shutdown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save backups in time-stamped folders to easily identify when the backups were created. Specify how many folders you wish to keep and FEBE removes the oldest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backup reminder. FEBE can alert you if a backup has not been completed in a specified number of days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive results report with links to the author’s extension/theme homepages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;User-defined backups. Make backups of virtually any file or folder - Firefox related or not. Just specify what to backup and FEBE does the rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extensive built-in help files. Just click the little blue information icons in FEBE options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verify your extension directory. Upgrading Firefox versions sometimes leaves garbage in the extensions directory. FEBE can clean it up. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick Backup. You can quickly backup as many or as few individual extensions/themes as you like. They can be saved together in a single, installable xpi file (Similar to CLEO). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;… and more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Once installed, FEBE is available from the Firefox Tools menu. An icon can be placed on the toolbar via (right-click on toolbar) &amp;gt; Customize...

FEBE for Thunderbird (TEBE) beta is being upgraded to work on the latest Tb releases.  It is available &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://outgoing.mozilla.org/v1/2f1e9dae17b86e7070982df54aa861496eb958a91dcaef54c41dd8803bca01d9/http%3A//www.customsoftwareconsult.com/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ff=12&amp;amp;t=2957"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; If you are upgrading from a previous FEBE major version or upgrading from a older Firefox version, you should clear your previous settings. Go to &lt;i&gt;Tools &amp;gt; FEBE &amp;gt; FEBE Options &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Clear FEBE preferences&lt;/i&gt;.
