I thought it was about time someone wrote a proper guide to grabbing free FV. hate ya says August 15, 2012 at 3:51 PM its useless Lee hodson says September 1, 2012 at 5:23 PM Will be now. Hasn’t been updated for a long time. Thank you for your invaluable and constructive comment. Feel free to write your own guide and have it posted here. Elżbieta Chorobik says March 11, 2011 at 10:42 PM super!!!! will now be easier for me to play !!!! thank you !!!! :D :D :D Reply Yada says March 19, 2011 at 2:25 AM I had a few dummy accounts, but now facebook does not let me enter any of the accounts unless I validate the accounts with a cellphone number. And it doesn’t let me use the same number for more than 1 account. A few days ago it was optional, now it seems it’s mandatory. What do I do now? :( Reply Lee Hodson says March 21, 2011 at 2:29 AM Send off for a couple of free sim cards :o) Lee Hodson says June 17, 2011 at 8:27 PM there is another option here too: after logging into the accounts, when Facebook asks you to confirm/validate them, just click the Facebook logo at the top left of the screen. Lee Hodson says June 17, 2011 at 8:27 PM there is another option here too: after logging into the accounts, when Facebook asks you to confirm/validate them, just click the Facebook logo at the top left of the screen. Dummy Account Master says March 23, 2011 at 3:55 AM I have always used the dummy account stuff. I use it for farmville cityV happy aqquariam .etc………… Reply Lee Hodson says March 23, 2011 at 11:05 PM Dummy accounts are brilliant for playing games. I used them a lot when I played 140 Mafia and other 140 games on Twitter. I have a great guide to quick leveling planned for release in the next few days. I will post it either Friday or Sunday, after I’ve finished writing it. It will come in handy for your dummy FV accounts. Dheeraj says April 25, 2011 at 4:45 PM its awesome Reply Lee Hodson says June 5, 2011 at 10:33 PM And now it’s improved :) Anushka_anu says June 22, 2011 at 5:46 PM the reactivation of account does not work ……. i did it the same after a month but no fv Reply Lee Hodson says June 23, 2011 at 6:05 AM Had you used an autoplayer on the account during that month? Zynga have recently made some far reaching changes to Farmville, that could be another cause for it no longer working. Did you try all three reactivation links? To be honest, once you have created a new account, you are better off gaining XP using an autoplayer to continuously buy and sell market items than you are to wait a month and then re-activate it. FV cashstops accruing after level 250 so the maximum FV you could ever earn is 65 + 250 + anything given away in eggs and through the completion of in game missions. Zynga have recently removed the ability to send market items to neighbors. I hope they reimplement the option soon. hatter says June 26, 2011 at 9:11 AM its awsome….. pls share the trick of a uniwither ring Reply Lee Hodson says June 26, 2011 at 10:55 AM I will be rewriting a few segments of this post a little later today to show workarounds for the “Instant Share” of Farm rewards feature that Zynga recently introduced. I’ll see what’s available for the unwither ring over the next few days. Happy farming Hatter Yatinjain says June 27, 2011 at 4:13 AM its best i got all the mystery boxes Reply Abby says July 4, 2011 at 11:02 PM This is an awesome guide! I do have one major suggestion though. I made a dummy account yesterday just for the quick 65FV at the beginning to send myself some trees and I found myself short of level 11 (I was stuck at low level 9) I figured I may have done something wrong though. Today I paid extra close attention to your instructions and found I didn’t. Here is where I ran into trouble: “Place 45 hay bales from the market onto your farm You will now be at level 9 with 73 FV, 5,121 Coins and will have earned the following yellow ribbons” I found that I was left with just under 3,000 Coins and I couldn’t finish buying the next bunch of hay bales (5) + (45) was fine, but then I got 27 bales out of the next 50 and couldn’t place anymore. I even sold everything but the one haybale in my inventory try and make more coins. Yesterday I spent some of the FV cash to bring it up to level 11 (I bought the bald eagle) I also won the yellow ribbon “High Roller” for spending a certain amount of coins and that ribbon isn’t listed on here. I’m thinking maybe Zynga updated some of the ribbons or something in the three months this has been out.I noticed on 6/26 that you said you were going to rewrite a few segments of this, and I don’t know if you haven’t gotten to it. However, I think you should make a dummy account and play through your guide. Maybe something was overlooked or something? Thank you for the guide though, REALLY :D Reply Lee Hodson says July 4, 2011 at 11:16 PM Abby, they might have changed something though I last updated this guide while creating a dummy account about a week ago. I have cut it up a bit since then while splitting the guide into two posts (this one and an autoplayer user guide). It’s more than likely that have accidentally taken something out – I will check tonight/tomorrow. There are several methods for getting to level 10 that don’t require getting ribbons. I will add those methods into the guide as well. I’m glad you like the guide and thanks for your suggestion :) viv says July 7, 2011 at 9:48 PM The two disposable email links are not working. fb is not accepting, i clicked the link and place the confirmation code but got msg saying your account is not confirmed Lee Hodson says July 7, 2011 at 10:06 PM Thanks Viv. Looks like gmail and Yahoo are about to get a lot of new traffic. In the meantime, if FB let you create an account and you can log into it then you will be able to change the email address to a gmail one and resend the confirmation link. Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 7:54 PM I’ve just tested the disposable email addresses and they work fine for me. Must have been a glitch on the day :) Abby says July 10, 2011 at 4:38 PM You’re welcome. I’m going to try this again because I couldn’t get my autoplayer to work the last time so I’m about to make a new dummy account to test this. I hope I can get it to work because I’m tired of making dummy accounts for just the 65FV :) Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 12:28 AM The amount of FV we can gain from a dummy account varies according to the game glitches that can be used. Those glitches are regularly patched. There is a plugin an autoplayer plugin called “ToolBox” that has a section called “FarmGold”. FarmGold is the long standing method used to gain high XP in a very short time period. I’ve left out instructions for using FarmGold because I can’t get it to work on my system. Maybe you will have better luck with it. Abby says July 10, 2011 at 4:48 PM Also, I have one more question. At the beginning of your instructions you say to claim the porch house and bistro table, but to only place the bistro table. The last time it said to place both… I just wanted to tell you in case it was something you forgot to put in Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 12:23 AM Did I say Bistro, oops! I meant to say Porch House. I’ve edited it. Thanks. Abby says July 10, 2011 at 4:51 PM Ugh, I know it isn’t my job to edit your wonderful guide… BUT. You said to buy a trading post… and place it next to the trading post…. Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 12:38 AM Thanks, Abby, I’ve edited it :-) Abby says July 12, 2011 at 4:20 PM Haha, sorry. I feel bad for saying all these things that were “wrong” with it when it is still so amazing. I have no time to read through more… I actually just stop after I hit level 10 because for some reason I can’t get me SEA_Links plugin to work and no one on the forums can figure out why it is being a turd. Oh well! When Zynga releases new items I’ll have to make another (I collect gnomes xD) and maybe then they’ll stop changing it. Lee Hodson says July 12, 2011 at 6:04 PM No need to feel sorry. I really don’t mind constructive advice. I have a nice collection of gnomes too, and horses. Not sure but I might start collecting pigs and sheep as well. There is an alternative to SEA_Links: you can use MyRewards to collect your foals. Also, there is a plugin called Stealer that will automatically collect (click) the links collected by other accounts played by FarmVilleBot Lite. I don’t use stealer so often because I prefer to share links with friends but you might find it useful. Abby says July 20, 2011 at 11:50 PM Okay so I know this is a little late BUT…. MyRewards doesn’t work either. I’ve reinstalled it completely a few times so bleck. I like the Stealer option but would that work, say, if I generated the foals links and and use stealer on another account? The few times that I’ve generated the foals links and was able to see them and use them, they were all expired instantly as in someone claimed the horses. I’ve begun using the dummy accounts to collect the collections like French, Mexican and Spain which are the most recent ones. Lee Hodson says July 21, 2011 at 1:07 AM Have you updated the plugin, parser and settings files? I had a problem with ToolBox that rectified after I updated FVManager. You could try deactivating a few plugins to see whether MyRewards and SEA_Links begin to work. The links generated by the autoplayer do expire quickly but I suspect that you have Stealer running on a few accounts and it’s nicking your foals for the wrong accounts. Deactivate Stealer and see what happens with your foal links. The rewards collected by FVB are stored in c”FarmVilleBot~[account number]rewards Open the file in a text editor that can use Regular Expressions (Notepad ++ and Edit Pad Pro are good ones) then use the following search and replace patterns to format the links: Search: ” Replace: rn Search: ^(?!reward.php).*$ Replace: leave blank Search: (reward.php.*) Replace: apps.facebook.com/onthefarm/1 (add http:// to the front of the final replace pattern. I had to remove it to force the URL to display properly). Login to the account you want to use the rewards links with then paste the links into http://urlopener.com. Abby says July 10, 2011 at 4:56 PM I promise this is my last one…. You say to buy the animal trough and then the rest tent and then the trading post and by the time you buy the rest tent you are still level four with 120exp and you need to be level 5 (140). Even buying two rest tents will only give you 130… Abby says July 10, 2011 at 4:59 PM Okay nevermind… It took five minutes to even log the exp. Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 12:22 AM It looks like FV has made a few more changes. I will update the guide again. Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 8:47 PM Zynga changed the required level for buying the Animal Trough. I’ve edited the method to work with that change. Lee Hodson says July 5, 2011 at 1:11 PM You were right, Zynga had indeed changed something. I’m not sure what but I’ve managed to work around it. The guide now works again. Celebifan251 says July 7, 2011 at 11:45 AM The Exact same thing happened to me! omg! when it came to the buying haybales, i was 1,000 coins short! i bought bald eagle too and now its all better. i hate that i had to do it but i did. Lee Hodson says July 7, 2011 at 1:04 PM Was that with the current guide (I changed it a few days ago)? If so then Zynga must be randomly changing the way the game plays for different players. Let me know at which point the game play deviates from the expected results as shown in the guide. I will check over it again. On a side note, you could have used the autoplayer suggested in the guide. You could used it to create links for foals which could then have been sold for coins. Celebifan251 says July 5, 2011 at 5:07 AM Awesome, but your not doing the math right…that takes it down a notch for hackers. My friend tried this and ended up sitting there for hours wondering what she did wrong,and she came to me and said ; Oh help mee! sobby sobby sob. i sat down and looked at the screen. and it was down 1,000 coins! slapped my forehead ,sighed , and just screwed up the whole thing after that. so i tried to make one for her and followed the instructions…same thing. But love it! soo awesome! i might just make a few myself =). Reply Lee Hodson says July 5, 2011 at 1:12 PM Zynga had changed something over the past few days that prevented the method shown in the guide from working properly. I’ve updated it and it now works again. Please let me know if you find an errors in the new guide. Cutepinkrose2000 says July 6, 2011 at 7:14 AM cool !!!! Reply Cööl MußĕEn says July 7, 2011 at 10:43 AM I jxt need FarmVille Cheats plxx help me…:)) Reply Lee Hodson says July 7, 2011 at 12:59 PM The cheats I know about are best taken advantage of using an autoplayer. I’ve written an introductory guide to using one (FarmVilleBot) here. Joser0275 says July 9, 2011 at 8:56 PM if you run out of money to buy hay bales you can use your free mystery dart to get more coins when you sale what you got :) Reply Himanshu Waingankar says July 10, 2011 at 8:19 AM thanks to the on who made this webpage!!!!!!!!!!!! now its easier for me 2 play farmville!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thanks again Reply Lee Hodson says July 10, 2011 at 12:21 PM You’re welcome :-) Nimishverma says July 10, 2011 at 4:20 PM DUDE we cant buy Trade PPost at level 4 it is for level 5 Reply Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 12:20 AM DUDE, when I last updated this guide, we could. FarmVille is regularly updated, perhaps something has changed over the last 5 days. You are free to figure another process in the meantime. Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 8:48 PM No longer an issue. I’ve updated the instructions with a workaround. Jainkarthik says July 11, 2011 at 5:56 PM hey the two welcome pack isnt working plz check out what is the problem……… Reply Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 7:39 PM The best I can do is create a dummy account and test the links. There is nothing I can do if they no longer work. Lee Hodson says July 11, 2011 at 7:43 PM I can only test the links by creating another dummy account. If Zynga has voided them then there is nothing I can do until Zynga releases new ones. Sygkbyjs says July 20, 2011 at 4:15 AM HEY THE LINKS DON’T WORK ANYMORE!!! :( IT WAS FINE BEFORE BUT TODAY IT STOPPED WORKING. ANYONE NOTICE THIS??? Joser0275 says July 20, 2011 at 5:20 AM yes me to :( Ismet 123 says July 20, 2011 at 5:50 AM me to :( Guest says July 20, 2011 at 6:08 AM darnit!!! what’s up with zynga. i’m sooo mad. they released new stuff in the market tonight :( :( :( Bothahe says July 20, 2011 at 9:08 AM LOL, lets hope its sorted soon, I need the horse… guest of zynga says July 20, 2011 at 9:08 AM whats happening…the 65 fv cash trick is not working today….plzz help us….has zynga removed it ….plzz leave us a comment :( Lee Hodson says July 20, 2011 at 10:57 AM I’ll look into it a little later today. In the meantime, if possible, watch your emails for your new dummy accounts just in case Zynga has released new email rewards. You can use the autoplayer to boost a dummy account’s level. The guide to FVB is at http://journalxtra.com/2011/06/farmville-tips-tricks-and-cheats-using-an-autoplayer/ Mila_b929 says July 21, 2011 at 12:32 AM I followed the instructions carefully last night but it’s only $5 in FV cash…I did try before..about 20 dummy accounts and it did work!! Lee Hodson says July 21, 2011 at 1:14 AM I know, Zynga has changed the rewards offered by the links. Hopefully they will restore the FV rewards in a few days. Best way to get FV now is with the autoplayer. The autoplayer guide is here. Marcianngarretson says July 21, 2011 at 6:14 PM i tried today and its not working still.. dummies arnt either.. Lee Hodson says July 21, 2011 at 6:29 PM I’m rewriting the autoplayer guide at this moment. I will take a look at this guide in an hour or two. Thanks :) arthur says July 23, 2011 at 10:25 PM maybe taking away the free fv for new accounts and all the out of sync problems has to do with them wanting us to take up that norton 70 free fv campaign they’ve got up! arghhh. guest of zynga says July 20, 2011 at 2:08 PM Dion de ville you are doing a great job.But my frnd plzz help us the links are no longer working.PLzz post any new links so that we can get fv cash for free.plzz leave a comment. Lee Hodson says July 20, 2011 at 2:15 PM Comment left :) I am looking for new links. I’ve not found any yet. As soon as I find some I will post them. I suspect Z* will re-activate the old links or publish new links as soon as they see game uptake numbers drop as people stop creating new accounts. Have you been through your old dummy accounts to earn FV through level increases up to level 250? For the moment it seems that’s the best way to get free FV. Sergeantamber says July 23, 2011 at 8:59 AM Hey, I tried it today and didn’t even get the 65fvc. I don’t think i did anything wrong.. and then i didn’t get the first two welcome gift things… Lee Hodson says July 23, 2011 at 9:24 PM The links for 65 FV have been disabled by Zynga. Until Zynga reactivate them an autoplayer is the only way to quickly earn 65 FV (it’s actually 80 FV and takes abut an hour depending on computer speed and Internet connection speed). The autoplayer guide is here. I will look at the other reward links later. jellica says July 20, 2011 at 9:54 PM thank you for this! your wonderful guys. i was able to purchase the horses and send to my account, now i have collection of horses… but the other day, farmville was down, no one can seem to play and open the game for several hours except for those who never logged out..then yesterday, i opened a new dummy account, i wasn’t succesful, i only have 5FV which shocked me because i always do the right thing and followed the instructions perfectly.. can you check or is it just me? maybe zynga found it out and made changes, fixed the glitch or something??? Reply Lee Hodson says July 20, 2011 at 10:32 PM Hi Jellica, it looks like Zynga has changed the rewards offered by the links. The links currently provide all goods but the FV they once offered. I’ve been told this has happened before. The last time it happened the FV given by the links was removed for a couple of days so it is possible the links will work again in a few days time. I will adjust the guide when I know more. Mila_b929 says July 21, 2011 at 12:59 PM I’m using hotmail to create dummy accounts before..but now facebook is kinda strict..asking phone number before u can log in and use farmville… Reply Lee Hodson says July 21, 2011 at 2:14 PM Click the Facebook logo when it asks you to enter a phone number. The logo will take you directly to your account. guest of zynga says July 21, 2011 at 2:51 PM hey dion….any new news on the 65 fv cash links…is it working yet….plzz can u update on it and leave a comment if there any new news. Lee Hodson says July 21, 2011 at 8:09 PM Still not working but there is new way to take an account from level 1 to 75 using the autoplayer and nothing but the autoplayer. I’ve nearly rewritten the autoplayer guide, look toward the bottom where it says Quick Leveling. Marcianngarretson says July 21, 2011 at 6:09 PM i have been trying to do it and have been very successfull before.. thanks for that.. but now facebook is asking for phone verification.. it was nice while it lasted Reply Marcianngarretson says July 21, 2011 at 6:10 PM oh.. the two dummie accounts up there are not working for facebook now.. Lee Hodson says July 21, 2011 at 8:14 PM Take a look at my reply to the comment just above yours to learn how to quickly level dummy accounts. Also, skip the phone number verification by clicking the Facebook logo when setting up a new account. Shivamozarkar says July 22, 2011 at 11:49 AM it not working more ! sheet is there any more tricks plzzzz publish on ur wall ! Reply Lee Hodson says July 22, 2011 at 2:22 PM Read the writing in blue at the top of the post :) mickey says July 22, 2011 at 5:28 PM i can’t get it to work. :( Reply B8882397 says July 23, 2011 at 3:58 AM i did not gt anything simply time waste :( Reply Lee Hodson says July 23, 2011 at 9:38 PM Did you read the blue writing at the top of the page? It’s there for a reason. Marcianngarretson says July 23, 2011 at 5:05 PM was making a dummie account and they asked for my phone number.. did what you suggested by clicking on the facbook logo and it did not bypass it.. please let me know if there is other way.. making ones for my autoplayer.. thanks for all of the wonderful tips you have given us.. Reply Lee Hodson says July 23, 2011 at 9:43 PM It depends on whether FB just wants a phone number or whether it wants to send an activation code to the phone number. If FB only wants a phone number then google for phone numbers and you will find hundreds of thousands of ones you can use ;) FB restricts the number of accounts that can be made by an individual each day. You could try using a different browser or a proxy IP address. Shahrozshakil says July 23, 2011 at 5:12 PM its not working :( why ???? Reply Lee Hodson says July 23, 2011 at 9:39 PM Read the message in blue text at the top of the page. guest of zynga says July 29, 2011 at 7:57 AM hi dion…thanks a ton…ur autoplayer guide was awesome.Dion can you plzz help me….is their any way that i can get a horse(grown one…not the foal) using the bot.I have seen codes of the horses how can i use this codes to get full grow horses.Eagerly waiting for ur reply :D Lee Hodson says July 29, 2011 at 5:16 PM I can think of five ways to do it: Use a dummy account to create Blue Mained Gypsies using SEA_GlitchHolidayReward. Use Easy iPhone Items (forum page here) to grab a few Silver Ponies. Use the Mustang Quest (forum page here) plugin. Use the Regift plugin to send yourself a brown horse from a Quickie Mart account. Use FarmGold from the Toolbox plugin to perpetually harvest the nursery. Fill the nursery with foals first. Unlinked plugins are mentioned in the main post. Let us know if you find more methods :-) Shivam Ozarkar says July 24, 2011 at 9:04 AM Why Do u Stopped it plzz tell ? Reply James Jain says July 29, 2011 at 1:00 PM the three links of 20 fvc isn’t working check out………… Reply Lee Hodson says July 29, 2011 at 5:23 PM Thanks for keeping us updated, James. The autoplayer linked in the article works fine though. UnfortunateBeing says August 3, 2011 at 10:42 PM why is the 3 links to have 65 fv doesn’t work anymore :(( please help ? Reply Lee Hodson says August 4, 2011 at 1:15 PM Zynga canceled them. I’ve left them in place in case Zynga re-activates them. Bjwilliams33 says August 5, 2011 at 10:52 PM I am not a cheater and it reminds me of all the back room deals the Dem. have done. I would just like to have the money I earned back. I can’t buy anything because my farm is too small and I can’t seem to increase it anymore, no more neighbors. Please give the money back, I won’t ask for the eight eggs you took from me. By the way I love Farmville I just don’t like to be taken to the cleaners. Reply Lee Hodson says August 7, 2011 at 5:02 PM Use the autoplayer to earn a bit of money. It’s the easiest option. Rustypipe101 says August 6, 2011 at 2:58 AM i dont get the 20 farmcash links…….. Reply Rustypipe101 says August 6, 2011 at 3:14 AM i am sorry to say…. the links you have provided do not work… Reply Lee Hodson says August 7, 2011 at 5:03 PM I know. The blue writing at the top of the article explains that. Thanks for keeping us updated. warhead says August 7, 2011 at 4:20 PM Can any one tell is this trick works still ? Reply Lee Hodson says August 7, 2011 at 5:05 PM The links for free FV no longer work. The method described for taking an account to level 10 does work. The best option for creating an account for sending FV to your main account is the autoplayer. Pinky Mimi90 says August 9, 2011 at 11:32 PM i tried many time to get the farm cash from the first three links but it didn’t work :(please answer me , how to get them? Reply Lee Hodson says August 9, 2011 at 11:58 PM I just want to check something, where did you read the article? I’m getting a few people saying the same thing yet right at the top of this article there is a note saying that the 3 free FV links no longer work.

I haven’t used the FarmVille bot for a long time. The best place to receive help the the bot’s forum. I am sorry I can’t be more help. Candyxx12 says February 2, 2012 at 10:11 PM in step four the first 2 links did nothing for me Reply LeftyDude says February 29, 2012 at 5:48 AM At this point, none of the tips in step 4 (since we’re skipping 3) do anything (well, the 3rd thing gives the goat, but you’re level 1 with no bails and nothing but the porch and 200 or so coins). This whole guide should be removed/redone since it no longer works for a jump start. Reply Lee Hodson says February 29, 2012 at 8:33 PM It does need to be redone but between work and life I have little time to do it. You are welcome to rewrite it and publish it at JournalXtra if you care to do so. Shusha55 says March 7, 2012 at 10:22 AM I got 2000 Fb Credit from the page bellow.. it really works like a charm..
