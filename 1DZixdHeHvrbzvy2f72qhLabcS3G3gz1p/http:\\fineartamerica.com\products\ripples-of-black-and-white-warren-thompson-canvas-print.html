About Canvas Prints
Corner Detail: Stretched canvas print with 1.5" stretcher bars and mirrored image sides. Also available with black sides, whites sides, and 5/8" stretcher bars.
Bring your artwork to life with the texture and depth of a stretched canvas print. Your image gets printed on one of our premium canvases and then stretched on a wooden frame of 1.5" x 1.5" stretcher bars (gallery wrap) or 5/8" x 5/8" stretcher bars (museum wrap). All stretched canvases ship within 2 - 3 business days and arrive "ready to hang" with pre-attached hanging wire, mounting hooks, and nails.
Stretched canvas prints look beautiful with or without frames.
Fine Art America is one of the largest, most-respected giclee printing companies in the world with over 40 years of experience producing museum-quality prints. All of our prints are produced on state-of-the-art, professional-grade Epson printers. We use acid-free papers and canvases with archival inks to guarantee that your prints last a lifetime without fading or loss of color.
