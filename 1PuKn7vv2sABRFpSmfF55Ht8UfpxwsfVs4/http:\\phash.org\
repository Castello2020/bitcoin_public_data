<h1>What is a perceptual hash?</h1>
			
<p>A perceptual hash is a fingerprint 
of a multimedia file derived from various features from its content. Unlike cryptographic 
hash functions which rely on the avalanche effect of small changes in input leading to drastic 
changes in the output, perceptual hashes are "close" to one another if the features  
are similar.

<h3>Relevance of Perceptual Hashing</h3>
<p>Perceptual hashes must be robust enough to take into account transformations 
or "attacks" on a given input and yet be flexible enough to distinguish between 
dissimilar files. Such attacks can include rotation, skew, contrast adjustment and different compression/formats.  All of these challenges make perceptual hashing an interesting field of study and at the forefront of computer science research. </p>
</div>
<div class="splitright">
<h3>What is pHash?</h3>
<p>pHash is an open source software library released under the  <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3</a> license 
that implements several perceptual hashing algorithms, and provides a C-like API 
to use those functions in your own programs. pHash itself is written in C++. pHash was created by Evan Klinger.</p>

<h3>News and Updates:</h3>
<div class="newsbox">
<p><em>04.23.2013</em> pHash 0.9.6 released. Fix some compilation errors and warnings, as well as updates to the automake files to support building on Gentoo. 
<p><em>11.23.2012</em> pHash 0.9.5 released. Fix compilation problem with using deprecated FFmpeg functions.
<p><em>10.20.2011</em> <b>Cumulix 1.0</b> Cumulix is an extremely fast and scalable cloud-based image search and retrieval system based on pHash Pro and Neo4j.
<p><em>01.31.2011</em> pHash 0.9.4 released. Added radial image hash to Java bindings, fixed compilation on Mac OS X with complex header type, and the examples linking to pthread.
<p><em>12.24.2010</em> <b>MVPTree v1.0</b> New download available. The MVPTree is a generic
distance-based indexing structure to store n-dimensional data points. The distance function is
configurable as well as the type of data.</p>
<p><em>10.29.2010</em> <b>AudioScout v1.0</b> audio content indexing software released!
A <i>scalable</i> audio content indexing solution for managing a collection
of audio files, AudioScout is a set of <i>distributed</i> servers that index audio signals
based on low-level features in the signal,  not just simply on the filename or even its metadata.
This makes it ideal for such uses as duplicate detection or the protection of copyrights.  
It works on both music and speech content. Read the preliminary <a href="/audioscoutm.pdf">paper</a> or
<a href="mailto:support@phash.org">contact us</a> for further details.
</p>
<p><em>08.15.2010</em> pHash 0.9.3 released. 
Fixed a bug with the auxiliary header file causing mp3 support to break.
</p>
<p><em>08.15.2010</em> pHash 0.9.2 released. 
Fixed a bug in the audio perceptual hash when converting from stereo to mono for WAV/Ogg/FLAC 
audio files.
</p>

<p><em>06.15.2010</em> pHash 0.9.1 released. 
Removed dependency on ffmpeg for audio functions (now using libmpg123,libsndfile and libsamplerate libraries),
cleaned up java bindings, fixed bug in determining number of cpus on mac os x,
fixed bug in multi-threaded image, audio and video functions, preliminary bindings for php and c#.
</p>

<p><em>03.28.2010</em> pHash 0.9.0 released. 
Multithreading support added for hash functions, audio hash can now read ogg and flac files and image hash 
can handle RGBA files. Fixed a heap corruption bug in the mvp storage functions.
</p>
<p><em>01.28.2010</em> pHash 0.8.1 released. Minor bug fixes for MH image hash and compilation with older gcc releases.
</p>

<p><em>01.25.2010</em> pHash 0.8.0 released. A new perceptual hash has been added based on the Marr/Mexican hat
wavelet, the JNI has been greatly improved, and several bugs have been fixed.
</p>
<p><em>12.23.2009</em> pHash 0.7.2 released. Fixed a bug when building on systems where mremap is not present.
</p>
<p><em>12.20.2009</em> pHash 0.7.1 released. Updates to the Java bindings to use new dct video hash, removed need for FFTW, included spec file for creating RPMs and general code clean up.
</p>
<p><em>12.12.2009</em> pHash 0.7 released. Fixed a bug in the perceptual text hash to make hash truly cyclic (credit to Xiaofan Lin for discovering the bug), now works with latest CImg versions, as well as on Windows and BSD systems.
</p>
<p><em>10.07.2009</em> pHash 0.6 released. The new release contains a 
variable length DCT video hash which supercedes the previous video hash.
</p>
<p><em>09.12.2009</em> The end-stopped wavelets are taking longer than 
anticipated, so in the meantime we've been devoting more time to 
improving the video hash to handle longer videos. Look for it in the 0.6 
release.
</p>
<p><em>07.22.2009</em> The next version of pHash is in the works and 
will include a new image hash based on Gabor and end-stopped wavelets, 
leading to better feature extraction. We will also be improving the video 
hash to account for longer videos. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p><em>07.02.2009</em>  pHash 0.5 released.</p>
<p><em>06.29.2009</em>  Custom index technique added for quick storage, search and retrieval of all hash values within a given distance  of a query.  This technique uses a specially developed file format for persistent storage and can be used for virtually any size hash and distance metric.  Preliminary testing reveals a 300% improvement in search time over a simple linear search. For image or audio hashes, additional storage amounts to less than 0.05% of the space used by the actual files. To be included in the 0.5 release!</p>
<p><em>06.22.2009</em> Support for Textual hashing is now in the library. Although support is limited to plain utf-8 textual encoded documents for now, the functions allow for a quick scan of documents to find string matches and their offsets.  Expect this in the next release.</p>
<p><em>06.05.2009</em> Changed the build system to use the gnu autoconf tools. This should make things easier to build and install the pHash lib and program files.</p>
<p><em>04.15.2009</em> Java bindings for all pHash library functions.</p>
<p><em>02.03.2009</em> <em>pHash</em> now supports hashing for audio files. Derived from frequency spectrum data along the bark scale, this hash is based on characteristics that tend to be the most prominent for the human auditory system.  Furthermore, the number of hashes generated per file vary according to the number of samples in the audio file, so short clips can be matched to longer sound files.  Naturally, the longer the clip, the more successful it will be.  So far, this has proven to work well with 30 second music clips when altered by either mp3 compression and/or telephone simulated filtering.</p>
<p><em>11.04.2008-2010</em> The dct hash method has been adapted to video.  This is useful for short video clips only, since the entire video is condensed to a fixed length hash.</p>
<p><em>10.24.2008-2010</em> Support for an image hash based on the discrete cosine transform. The DCT is a quick and efficent method to write a hash based on frequency data of the underlying image.  While it is generally not sophisticated enough to identify visually similar images in any semantically meaningful way, it is fairly robust against minor distortions of the image, such as blurring, rotation and different compression formats.</p>

<h3>That's great but what is it good for?</h3>
<p>
Potential applications include copyright protection, similarity search for media files, 
or even digital forensics. For example, YouTube could 
maintain a database of hashes that have been submitted by the major 
movie producers of movies to which they hold the copyright. If a user 
then uploads the same video to YouTube, the hash will be almost 
identical, and it can be flagged as a possible copyright violation.
The audio hash could be used to automatically tag MP3 files with proper 
ID3 information, while the text hash could be used for plagiarism
detection.
