Mt. Gox suspends US dollar withdrawls “for the next two weeks”
World's largest bitcoin exchange is under investigation by US authorities.

Mt. Gox, the world’s largest Bitcoin-based exchange, announced early Thursday morning that it has suspended US dollar withdrawals “for the next two weeks.”
The Japan-based firm is currently under investigation by the United States Department of Homeland Security, which seized Mt. Gox's Dwolla account just last month. At the end of May 2013, Mt. Gox began requiring user verification in the wake of the Liberty Reserve bust.
The price of one bitcoin in dollars appears to have very slightly risen on the news, hovering around $112 as of press time.
Mt. Gox said in a press release:
Over the past weeks Mt. Gox has experienced rising volumes of deposits and withdrawals from established and upcoming markets interested in Bitcoin. This increased volume has made it difficult for our bank to process the transactions smoothly and within a timely manner, which has created unnecessary delays for our global customers. This is especially so for those in the United States who are requesting wire transfer withdrawals from their accounts.
We are currently making improvements to process withdrawals of United States Dollar (USD) denominations, and as a result are temporarily suspending cash withdrawals of USD for the next two weeks.
Ars reached out to Mt. Gox to get more information, but the company did not immediately respond.

"Withdrawls" ... that's how they take their money out in the Southern US.

I would expect the BTC / USD rate to raise a bit more as people hear the news. I know if I had a USD balance at MtGox I would be tempted to convert it to BTC and transfer it back to my personal wallet. With no ability to transfer USD out, there won’t be a lot of BTC sellers so the price should increase.

I got rid of the last of my bircoins last week. I had a good run, but with the ever increasing difficulty making my GPUs less and less effective, and me not being able to trust any of the various ASIC vendors, I realized it wasn't worth my time anymore.And with this news that the government is going to start meddling even more, I'm even more happy with my decision.

These guys are assholes and thieves. They blocked my account because my submitted driver license's scan had a bit of signature cut (it's how it was issued). Since then they decline any withdrawal, even in bitcoins, while they publicly claim that BTC withdrawals are not subject to verification.Oh, and my account has about 8 BTC. These guys are assholes and thieves.

Can you move the money stored in MtGox to another bank, in another currency, then move that money back into the US?

On the other hand you can move BTC out of MtGox so people with a USD balance at MtGox who get cold feet will buy BTC to transfer back to their own wallets.. with nobody selling this will drive the price up.

For example trades in thin markets like collectible cars or art are notorious for traders colluding to establish and publicize inflated prices before items are subsequently sold to idiots for big gains.

Recently the daily volume has been around 40,000 bitcoins - that's a hell of a lot of 'collusion' to swindle some punter cashing out a handful of bitcoins!

If people can't withdraw their USD, but can withdraw their BTC - then they'll prefer to have BTC and so there will be more demand for buying BTC than selling.I have a little nitpick in what you said though. You said "BTC / USD rate" when you actually meant "USD / BTC rate". The BTC / USD rate will go down whereas the USD / BTC rate will go up. Those rates are reciprocal of one another.

The exchange can report any figures it wants to and can also refuse to honor quoted prices. Stock market exchanges have, in the past, also been manipulated. Have you ever heard of penny stocks? They are bought and sold on an auction market but reported prices and volume can't be believed. In the bitcoin market the small player has no control and there is no regulatory mechanism in place. The exchanged have total control and operate behind an impenetrable blind.

I am not willing to believe that every forum, blog post, comment or article on bitcoin has been faked as part of a vast conspiracy - which includes deleting from the internet every instance of a genuine bitcoin seller receiving a significantly different price for their bitcoin compared to the quoted price on the exchange. Based on the preponderance of evidence, I will accept the exchange prices as being true until I see evidence to the contrary. The manipulation of prices of penny stocks is well known to anyone who trades in financial markets. In such cases the prices and volumes may not be an accurate reflection of the true value, but they are real transactions and do actually occur on the exchange. If the same manipulation was occurring on the bitcoin exchange, I would expect to see similar patterns of price and volume fluctuations that indicate a pump and dump strategy. If a pump and dump is not the goal, and a much longer term 'manipulation' is occurring, then the current price of bitcoins is being reported accurately, since with the narrow spreads that is the price at which buyers and sellers can access the market. We are not discussing investing - just the current price for buying and selling.

I will yet again point out that the US Government beef with Mt.Gox is not about BTC, per se, but is about complying with regulations dealing with moving money around for others. They really don't care that it specifically relates to BTC.And to the people who have been surprised that this is DHS and not one of the bank regulators, that just proves the point. DHS's jurisdiction is related to how money moves over the border. If this were about banking/finance, then, yes, it would be those other regulators involved.I know you'll ask "but then why am I wearing this tinfoil hat?" But that's really a different issue.

The problem lies in the fact that there is a tremendous incentive to commit fraud combined with a lack of mechanisms to prevent fraud complicated by thorny international jurisdiction issues. My last word is a prediction that there will be many people left holding the bag and the bag will be empty.

But that's really a different issue.(Tinfoil hat whispers: "Don't listen to him")But on a slightly more serious note: While BitCoin itself is "outside the reach" of the government, its direct usefulness is limited. It's growing but still depends heavily on exchange with dollars/pounds/yen/etc. As long as that's the case, the feds can still screw with it at the point of exchange. (It or any other "alternate currency" in a similar state.)

You can generate BTC without touching Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox was where you go to turn BTC into other currencies. With US withdrawals suspended, I imagine people will look elsewhere for trades.

While this is very much the same scenario as when a bank's big vault gets emptied, it is of course possible that the owner took the money of the vault themselves. Yet, there are already laws in place to prevent both of that and I am not sure if more regulation actually improves the situation or is merely a flimsy excuse to bring digital currencies under regulatory control. I believe an exchange does well when it's being used, and it is being used because people trust it as they have had a positive experience. In my world, that is a classic case of a free market at work.
