Quote from: mr_anderson on September 13, 2009, 09:01:38 AMI'm quite confused then Why is there a whole thread devoted to a bad call in a tennis match? Because the House of Windsor and the House of Rothschild have pushed over 2,000 articles out to the world in every single language calling her "crazy" and demanding an "investigation" into her violent death threats that could be ruled criminal and land her in jail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also the Bilderberg controlled media is running 24/7 hit pieces saying that she is whacked crazy to support the insane idea of an "investigation".The lynching is by the media.If the media did not blanket the airwaves calling her crazy and investigating her for death threats, then it will be exposed. The state run media has the power to target anyone, anytime, and destroy them by demonization, innuendo, and playing on hostility. The judge made a f**ked up call, Serena called her on it, the other judges took another point away to steal the match from her. When that happened she was respectful to the opponent for a well fought game and left without incident.Then the Bilderberg media, who is the most racist group of psychopaths the world has ever known, got hold of it...WHAMO!!!!!!!!!!!!

Quote from: OG on September 13, 2009, 08:51:58 AMSorry man, you have it backwards. The Royal Family is ceremonial, parliament has all the power. The only reason we still have a Royal Family is because it pulls in the punters who think its jolly nice to see the pomp and circumstance. If it wasn't for tourism they'd have been punted from the public purse decades ago. Land ownership? The US is built on the theft of land, so if we're going to start accusations about who owns what chunk of land and the history of that acquisition, you might want to start at home. Unless you're going to give your country back to the natives. The queen is a figure head, an avatar, even in the commonwealth. Don't mistake respect for governance.As for the Netherlands, no idea how they do things but from what I can gather the Dutch are perfectly happy with their royals.Really? The British queen has no power? She is only "cerimonial"?Then riddle me this: If she is so powerless, then why did the Canadian Prime Minister need her permission to disolve the Canadian Parliament, which he asked for through the queen bitch's governor general who is "the queen's representative" in Canada?http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=73391.0

Quote from: Sane on September 13, 2009, 08:58:06 AMOh really?Parliaments have the power?You are serious about this?Look, the royals are so powerful that the queen of ENGLAND can dissolve all of parliament of CANADA with the stroke of her pen.The Queen is so powerful she can over rule any and all decisions by the high court with a royal decree.The queen is so powerful she can take a baby from any hospital in britain/canada/australia and eat it alive with crumpets while sipping tea and order that the mother's head by cut off so that she can take a steaming shit in her skull. You tell me if parliament has that power.Now I am not saying that she has done this, has any intention of doing this, or will do this. But, the fact remains that she can do this and because she is supposedly ordained by god (whose god, we do not know), her actions cannot be judged by the inferior human beings. This is a fact, and has been for societies for 6,000 years. This country was founded on the concept that this form of societal structure is a travesty of humanity.Read my signature, it was written by Thomas Jefferson in the last letter he ever wrote. Sums up the foundation of America.You're right, but only technically, and only because at some point in history she did control parliament. That is no longer the case, and that statute of law is antiquated. The same goes for Australia, but in Australia's case they voted to keep the queen as the figurative head of state, it looks good for them. The queen has zero power over parliament here in the UK, and has not done for over 30 years (though no doubt she calls in favours). She has even less control now in foreign lands, which apart from having the queen as a figure head, have complete autonomy for the most part. Like I said, you're giving them too much credit, they are powerless. The sooner you realize that the sooner you'll realize that changing things for the better begins at home. If not then nothing will ever get done because you have zero control over England or the Netherlands. As I said, buckpassing your problems onto someone/thing you have no control over only shows you have no real desire to correct things, because as long as you are playing the blame game you can avoid action by pleading helplessness. Stop blaming everyone else for your problems. If you think your government is bowing to the will of the British, fix your government, don't blame the British. It is not our fault you lot are incompetent.

COMMON SENSEbyThomas Paine~~~~~~~~~~OF MONARCHY AND HEREDITARY SUCCESSION[...]To the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary succession; and as the first is a degradation and lessening of ourselves, so the second, claimed as a matter of right, is an insult and an imposition on posterity. For all men being originally equals, no one by birth could have a right to set up his own family in perpetual preference to all others forever, and though himself might deserve some decent degree of honors of his contemporaries, yet his descendants might be far too unworthy to inherit them. One of the strongest natural proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ass for a lion. Secondly, as no man at first could possess any other public honors than were bestowed upon him, so the givers of those honors could have no power to give away the right of posterity, and though they might say, "We choose you for our head," they could not, without manifest injustice to their children, say, "that your children and your children's children shall reign over ours for ever." Because such an unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool. Most wise men, in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest. This is supposing the present race of kings in the world to have had an honorable origin; whereas it is more than probable, that could we take off the dark covering of antiquity, and trace them to their first rise, that we should find the first of them nothing better than the principal ruffian of some restless gang, whose savage manners of preeminence in subtlety obtained him the title of chief among plunderers; and who by increasing in power, and extending his depredations, overawed the quiet and defenseless to purchase their safety by frequent contributions. Yet his electors could have no idea of giving hereditary right to his descendants, because such a perpetual exclusion of themselves was incompatible with the free and unrestrained principles they professed to live by. Wherefore, hereditary succession in the early ages of monarchy could not take place as a matter of claim, but as something casual or complemental; but as few or no records were extant in those days, and traditionary history stuffed with fables, it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed, Mahomet like, to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar. Perhaps the disorders which threatened, or seemed to threaten on the decease of a leader and the choice of a new one (for elections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced many at first to favor hereditary pretensions; by which means it happened, as it hath happened since, that what at first was submitted to as a convenience, was afterwards claimed as a right. England, since the conquest, hath known some few good monarchs, but groaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones, yet no man in his senses can say that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very honorable one. A French bastard landing with an armed banditti, and establishing himself king of England against the consent of the natives, is in plain terms a very paltry rascally original. It certainly hath no divinity in it. However, it is needless to spend much time in exposing the folly of hereditary right, if there are any so weak as to believe it, let them promiscuously worship the ass and lion, and welcome. I shall neither copy their humility, nor disturb their devotion. Yet I should be glad to ask how they suppose kings came at first? The question admits but of three answers, viz., either by lot, by election, or by usurpation. If the first king was taken by lot, it establishes a precedent for the next, which excludes hereditary succession. Saul was by lot, yet the succession was not hereditary, neither does it appear from that transaction there was any intention it ever should. If the first king of any country was by election, that likewise establishes a precedent for the next; for to say, that the right of all future generations is taken away, by the act of the first electors, in their choice not only of a king, but of a family of kings for ever, hath no parallel in or out of scripture but the doctrine of original sin, which supposes the free will of all men lost in Adam; and from such comparison, and it will admit of no other, hereditary succession can derive no glory. For as in Adam all sinned, and as in the first electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind were subjected to Satan, and in the other to Sovereignty; as our innocence was lost in the first, and our authority in the last; and as both disable us from reassuming some former state and privilege, it unanswerably follows that original sin and hereditary succession are parallels. Dishonorable rank! Inglorious connection! Yet the most subtle sophist cannot produce a juster simile. As to usurpation, no man will be so hardy as to defend it; and that William the Conqueror was an usurper is a fact not to be contradicted. The plain truth is, that the antiquity of English monarchy will not bear looking into. But it is not so much the absurdity as the evil of hereditary succession which concerns mankind. Did it ensure a race of good and wise men it would have the seal of divine authority, but as it opens a door to the foolish, the wicked; and the improper, it hath in it the nature of oppression. Men who look upon themselves born to reign, and others to obey, soon grow insolent; selected from the rest of mankind their minds are early poisoned by importance; and the world they act in differs so materially from the world at large, that they have but little opportunity of knowing its true interests, and when they succeed to the government are frequently the most ignorant and unfit of any throughout the dominions. Another evil which attends hereditary succession is, that the throne is subject to be possessed by a minor at any age; all which time the regency, acting under the cover of a king, have every opportunity and inducement to betray their trust. The same national misfortune happens, when a king worn out with age and infirmity, enters the last stage of human weakness. In both these cases the public becomes a prey to every miscreant, who can tamper successfully with the follies either of age or infancy. The most plausible plea, which hath ever been offered in favor of hereditary succession, is, that it preserves a nation from civil wars; and were this true, it would be weighty; whereas, it is the most barefaced falsity ever imposed upon mankind. The whole history of England disowns the fact. Thirty kings and two minors have reigned in that distracted kingdom since the conquest, in which time there have been (including the Revolution) no less than eight civil wars and nineteen rebellions. Wherefore instead of making for peace, it makes against it, and destroys the very foundation it seems to stand on. The contest for monarchy and succession, between the houses of York and Lancaster, laid England in a scene of blood for many years. Twelve pitched battles, besides skirmishes and sieges, were fought between Henry and Edward. Twice was Henry prisoner to Edward, who in his turn was prisoner to Henry. And so uncertain is the fate of war and the temper of a nation, when nothing but personal matters are the ground of a quarrel, that Henry was taken in triumph from a prison to a palace, and Edward obliged to fly from a palace to a foreign land; yet, as sudden transitions of temper are seldom lasting, Henry in his turn was driven from the throne, and Edward recalled to succeed him. The parliament always following the strongest side. This contest began in the reign of Henry the Sixth, and was not entirely extinguished till Henry the Seventh, in whom the families were united. Including a period of 67 years, viz., from 1422 to 1489. In short, monarchy and succession have laid (not this or that kingdom only) but the world in blood and ashes. 'Tis a form of government which the word of God bears testimony against, and blood will attend it. If we inquire into the business of a king, we shall find that (in some countries they have none) and after sauntering away their lives without pleasure to themselves or advantage to the nation, withdraw from the scene, and leave their successors to tread the same idle round. In absolute monarchies the whole weight of business civil and military, lies on the king; the children of Israel in their request for a king, urged this plea "that he may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles." But in countries where he is neither a judge nor a general, as in England, a man would be puzzled to know what is his business. The nearer any government approaches to a republic, the less business there is for a king. It is somewhat difficult to find a proper name for the government of England. Sir William Meredith calls it a republic; but in its present state it is unworthy of the name, because the corrupt influence of the crown, by having all the places in its disposal, hath so effectually swallowed up the power, and eaten out the virtue of the house of commons (the republican part in the constitution) that the government of England is nearly as monarchical as that of France or Spain. Men fall out with names without understanding them. For it is the republican and not the monarchical part of the constitution of England which Englishmen glory in, viz., the liberty of choosing a house of commons from out of their own body- and it is easy to see that when the republican virtue fails, slavery ensues. My is the constitution of England sickly, but because monarchy hath poisoned the republic, the crown hath engrossed the commons? In England a king hath little more to do than to make war and give away places; which in plain terms, is to impoverish the nation and set it together by the ears. A pretty business indeed for a man to be allowed eight hundred thousand sterling a year for, and worshipped into the bargain! Of more worth is one honest man to society, and in the sight of God, than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived.

She can then order the Prime Minister to lick up the mess and then impale himself with a crucifix while singing 'God save our gracious Queen'. She can then order every member of parliament to do the exact same thing (given the wife is pregnant of course)."Now, I am not sure what plane of reality you are in, but from the most basic form of logic, that seems to me like she might have a tinge of power over parliament in the UK.

What is wrong with you!?!?Come on man, shake it off already!See this is where we differ. You think that the british are "subjects" of the queen. That is not the case. I am not a subject of the queen and I am certainly not a royalist. I recognize them for what they are, leeches on the tax payer, nothing more. We have a constitutional monarchy, the parliament might "work for the queen", but that is only figuratively speaking. The queen has zero legal power to tell the British parliament what to do, even though the government acts "on behalf of the queen". Perhaps this is where the confusion arises and why people assume the queen runs the show when she does not. If Canada or Australia or even the United States want to kow tow and kiss the feet of the queen, then it says more about them than it does the British, who'd be more likely to throw spare change at her.@ lavosslayerSorry what would you like me to prove? I can prove that most of you are all mouth and no trousers. Ok, for arguments sake lets say the Queen does tell the US what to do, what are you going to do about it? Nothing, thats what. You'll all just sit here making shit up like the Queen drinking out of a skull or some other completely sensationalist claptrap, whining and crying that everything is the fault of the British. I mean if you are correct and the US never had independance, then you've been getting owned for 300 years, your still getting owned and you'll be getting owned in another 300 years becuase none of you have the balls to do anything about it, well except whine. You want proof? Look around you champ.And no Sane, the Queen cannot take a baby and eat it with crumpets.

The investigation and prosecution borders on James Earl Ray type insanity...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yetunde_PriceYetunde Hawanya Tara Price (August 9, 1972 – September 14, 2003) was the elder half-sister and personal assistant to leading tennis players Venus Williams and Serena Williams. At the time of her death, she was 31 years old, the eldest of their mother, Oracene Price's five daughters and mother of three children, a registered nurse and owner of a beauty salon. Price came into the public eye when she was the victim of murder by shooting on September 14, 2003 in a poor section of Compton, an area of Los Angeles County, California, known for its history of gang violence. She was shot in the head while riding in an SUV driven by her boyfriend (who police reported was the intended victim) and died at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.[1][2]Compton rapper The Game's song "Dreams" is dedicated to her memory, as it states at the end of the track.Southside Crips gang member Robert Edward Maxfield, 25, pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter on March 22, 2006, the day before his third trial in the killing was scheduled to start. The first two trials ended in a mistrial and a hung jury.[3] Prosecutors alleged during trial that Maxfield, surrounded by fellow gang members at a crack house, seized a firearm and took aim at the SUV when it approached. On April 6, 2006, Judge Steven Suzukawa sentenced Maxfield to 15 years in prison.[4]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Does any of that make sense to you? Two humg juries in such a supposedly open and shut case? Then he pleaded no contest? WHY? There were 2 hung juries. Was there more evidence? Read the prosecution's case again.Damn it, I do not know how to explain this. If you arer black in America and you play tennis, golf, and other recreational activities of the empire...you got a big target on your back. believe that shit.

Quote from: OG on September 13, 2009, 09:43:49 AMSee this is where we differ. You think that the british are "subjects" of the queen. That is not the case. I am not a subject of the queen and I am certainly not a royalist. I recognize them for what they are, leeches on the tax payer, nothing more. We have a constitutional monarchy, the parliament might "work for the queen", but that is only figuratively speaking. The queen has zero legal power to tell the British parliament what to do, even though the government acts "on behalf of the queen". Perhaps this is where the confusion arises and why people assume the queen runs the show when she does not. If Canada or Australia or even the United States want to kow tow and kiss the feet of the queen, then it says more about them than it does the British, who'd be more likely to throw spare change at her.@ lavosslayerSorry what would you like me to prove? I can prove that most of you are all mouth and no trousers. Ok, for arguments sake lets say the Queen does tell the US what to do, what are you going to do about it? Nothing, thats what. You'll all just sit here making shit up like the Queen drinking out of a skull or some other completely sensationalist claptrap, whining and crying that everything is the fault of the British.

Who's blaming the UK for all America's problems? Personally, I know any time that I have a problem, the first person to point the finger at is standing in the mirror.I think the Queen has way more power than you giver her credit for OG, but time will reveal the absolute truth of that to everyone eventually.One thing we need to do instead of bickering about the details is understand that we are all in the same boat regardless of what country you live in and start working toward making this world a better place wheather it is fighting the NWO or cleaning oil off baby seals or helping a stranger change a tire or whatever...

Ordinary British people would be outraged if the Royal family tried to overtly assert their rule. However the Elite literally worship the Royal Family and your own Prime Minister has to get on his knees and pathetically grovel to the queen.

Quote from: Sane on September 13, 2009, 09:13:03 AMBecause the House of Windsor and the House of Rothschild have pushed over 2,000 articles out to the world in every single language calling her "crazy" and demanding an "investigation" into her violent death threats that could be ruled criminal and land her in jail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also the Bilderberg controlled media is running 24/7 hit pieces saying that she is whacked crazy to support the insane idea of an "investigation".The lynching is by the media.If the media did not blanket the airwaves calling her crazy and investigating her for death threats, then it will be exposed. The state run media has the power to target anyone, anytime, and destroy them by demonization, innuendo, and playing on hostility. The judge made a f**ked up call, Serena called her on it, the other judges took another point away to steal the match from her. When that happened she was respectful to the opponent for a well fought game and left without incident.Then the Bilderberg media, who is the most racist group of psychopaths the world has ever known, got hold of it...WHAMO!!!!!!!!!!!!this is surely satire Logged

Critical JunctureChapter 5 -- TAVISTOCKB31412 / Sun, 8 Mar 2009 07:02:40 / Internationalhttp://bodo.gnn.tv/blogs/31412/Chapter_5_TAVISTOCKfrom Mind Control, World Control by Jim Keith (RIP)(ISBN 0-932813-45-3)Published by Adventures Unlimited Press 1997.pp. 43-51The Tavistock Institute for Human Relations, known by insiders as the “FreudHilton,” has been a major nexus for the worldwide psychological manipulationthat has taken place over the last 50 years. The Tavistock story—at leastthe public version of it—begins immediately after World War II, whenmembers of British military intelligence created the Institute. In its ownliterature Tavistock is described as an organization of “dynamic psychiatry”which was intended to practice what they term ‘societry” on the planet as awhole—and what I term world mind control.British military intelligence itself, in the persons of many of its chiefplayers, has been aimed at a one-world government since its inception.British Secret Service directors on an almost one-for-one basis have beenadvocates of Fabian socialism. [1] It is alleged that Tavistock was set upmuch earlier than its announced inception, over 20 years prior in 1921, byMajor John Rawlings Reese, on the orders of the Round Table’s RoyalInstitute of International Affairs (also known as Chatham House). The RIIA,along with the American Council on Foreign Relations, had been founded in1919 during the Versailles Peace Conference, both being early New WorldOrder executive arms.Reese was the man who dreamed of “building a society in which it is possiblefor any member of any social group to be treated [psychiatrically], withoutresort to legal means, and even if they do not desire such treatment.” Atthe end of World War II, Reese called for the creation of “psychologicalshock troops” who would fan out from the Tavistock Institute to engineer thefuture direction of society. [2]In 1932 Tavistock was put under the directorship of the German psychologistKurt Lewin. Lewin was a founder of the National Training Laboratories anddirector of the Harvard psychological Clinic, and—an odd qualification fora psychiatrist, I think—one of the key players in the original creation ofthe OSS in America.Lewin is credited with much of the original Tavistock into massbrainwashing, applying the results of repeated trauma and torture in mindcontrol to society at large. If terror can be induced on a widespread basisinto a society. Lewin has stated, then society reverts to a tabula rasa ablank slate, a situation where control can easily be instituted from anexterior point.Put it another way: By the creation of controlled chaos, the populace can bebrought to the point where it willingly submits to greater control. Lewinmaintained that society must be driven into a state equivalent to an “earlychildhood situation. He termed this societal chaos “fluidity.”Tavistock’s focus in the early days was on strategic warfare studies, inparticular of Germany, with emphasis on the reeducation of that errant NewWorld Order colony. During World War II many of the Institute’s members,including its founder, Reese, ran the British Psychological WarfareDirectorate and subsidiary organizations based in the United States. AfterWorld War II Tavistock can functionally be considered to have become a partof Britain’s Psychological Warfare Bureau, now working on projects dealingwith the brainwashing of populations. [3] Tavistock is governed by what itcalls an invisible college, echoing antique occultist terminology andreminding one that British intelligence was founded by Freemasons andremains deeply Freemasonic to this day. The original use of the term“invisible college,” prior to the announced creation of Tavistock, wasReese’s reference to an informal association he had created of all thepsychiatrists then working in the British military.For funding, the Tavistock Institute relies on large grants from anonymousbenefactors—with no doubt a substantial portion coming directly from theCrown—along with grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, the FordFoundation, the Carnegie Institute, the World Health Organization, and theBritish Home Office. Tavistock is also interlinked worldwide with a vastnetwork of other organizations and think tanks, including UNESCO, WHO, theWorld Federation for Mental Health, and the Rand Corporation. Tavistock issimply a front group for the psychological imp05ition of the New World Orderon the planet, and its main philosophic tool is the Hegelian dialecticframed in the terms of Lewin.The Rockefellers have always been prominent in deciding the course ofTavistock. According to the official chronicler of the group,“The Rockefeller Foundation, before making us a grant, would need to besatisfied, not only by our policies.., but also with the persons to carrythem out.” [4] In a Tavistock-funded profile of the group, it is stated that the role ofthe institute has been:“(a) The invention of the command psychiatrist as a medical-social rolecarrying out reconnaissance in a large structure and defined group, leadingto the ascertainment and recognition of critical problems in the sphere ofhuman relations and management.“(b) The invention of social psychiatry as a policy science permittingpreventative technical intervention in large-scale problems. ..“(c) The fashioning of a whole series of military institutions whichconcretely and effectively implemented the policies advocated.“(d) The invention of new types of therapeutic communities.“(e) The invention of cultural psychiatry…“Capability nurtured in the Tavistock for the psychiatrist to work with laypersonnel—in this case the military—in a collaborative partnership. Inother words, the strategy of command psychiatry and the developments towhich it led were psyche-dynamically conceived and based.”Tavistock, born from the collaboration of the international monied elite,military intelligence, and the materialistic psychiatric community, refersto its self-admitted “military” orientation as Operation Phoenix—again, aFreemasonic symbol that it shares with the infamous Vietnam Warassassination program. One is reminded of the Freemasonic legend “Ordo AbChao,” Order Out of Chaos, which could just as easily describe the Tavistockmethod of destroying a target subject, or a target population, prior toreprogramming; the Tavistock modus operandi.Throughout the Tavistock literature—either official orTavistock-inspired-they reiterate their “global vision” and make it clearthat the institute is intended to work its long-term “societry” on the worldregardless of the wishes of individuals who inhabit it.One of the most successful of Tavistock-offshoot organizations is what wasoriginally known as the National Training Laboratories (NTL), and now theNTL Institute for Applied Behavioral Sciences, founded in 1947. Located inBethel, Maine, the mission of the NTL is to give Lewin-inspired “groupdynamics” sessions to American leaders. Again, during group sessions“dissonance” or stress is introduced to destroy the individual’s previousbeliefs, and then a new, group-oriented personality is coaxed forth. Thisis the primary technical method used by a myriad of Tavistock-influenced“sensitivity” groups like Alanon and Esalen.Since the 1950s, NTL has processed the majority of America’s corporateleaders in its programs, while simultaneously running the same programsfor various segments of the government, including the Navy, the Departmentof Education, and the State Department. None dare call it mind control. [5]Eric Trist, the chairman of Tavistock’s governors, in 1963 described his andTavistock’s work on mass brainwashing, delineating in detail his theory of“social turbulence,” based upon the theories of Hegel, although again, Tristis far more quick to cite Lewin.Trist postulated that the administering of a series of traumatizing shocksupon a society would destabilize it, lowering the overall character of thesociety’s reasoning. Trist suggested that by late 1963 the world had movedinto a condition of “permanent social turbulence” that would serve to usherin a new condition of society, a new paradigm, and a new possibility forremaking the face of the planet.The nature of the permanent social turbulence that Trist foresaw is furtherdefined in a book published in 1975 by one of Trist’s associates, FredEmeIy. The book, Futures We Are In, likens the condition of current daysociety to the violent punk welfare state of Anthony Burgess’ novel, AClockwork Orange, written in the 1960s.Emery, in reflection of Trist, also trumpets Hegel. He describes the firststage of the breakdown of society as being “superficiality,” in whichprevious societal values are questioned and discarded. He uses as an exampleof this the death of the Judeo-Christian paradigm.The next inevitable state is “segmentation,” in which societal institutionsbreak down, resulting in a reversion to paranoid groups of individualshostile to each other.The next stage in the breakdown of society would be the launching of afascist movement akin to the Nazis.The final and most disrupted state of society is termed disassociation, inwhich the individual becomes the entirety of society for himself, and isisolated from other members of the group. The dominant culture of thesociety becomes “fantasy and superstition.” According to Trist, the current“wired society” where the main interaction of the individual is withelectronic media is only a metaphor for disassociation. Cyberpunks, NewAgers, and couch potatoes, take note. It is interesting to note that thesame progression can be seen in the microcosm with the induction of themultiple personality, an oft-asserted goal of intelligence agencybrain-banging.In May 1967 at Queen Elizabeth’s palatial estate in Deauville, France, aconference was convened. It was intended to update participants on ongoingprojects of the Tavistock network. This was the “Conference on TransatlanticTechnological Imbalance and Collaboration,” sponsored by the Scientific andTechnological Committee of the North Atlantic Assembly and the ForeignPolicy Research Institute. Among the projects mentioned at the conferencewere the collaboration of Emery and Trist on “social turbulence,” and theSRI-Tavistock “Images of Man” project.Participants in the conference included Tavistock’s Harland Cleveland;Willis Barman of the Tavistock offshoot Stanford Research Institute; Dr.Zbigniew Brzezinski, the future Carter national security advisor and theTrilateral Commission’s founding executive director: and Fred Emery, who hadearlier delineated the stages of societal disintegration in his Futures WeAre In. Other participants were Dr. Aurelio Peccei, later to head thezero-growth fixated Club of Rome, then chairman of the Economic Committee ofthe Atlantic Institute, an important NATO think tank; and Sir Alexander Kingand Sir Solly Zuckerman, advisors to the British crown.Fleshing out the hologram of elitist New World Order planning is theinformation that Brzezinski is believed by many in Western intelligenceorganizations to be a KGB mole, recruited by British Round Tabler andRothschild-Warburg agent William Yandell Elliot. Henry Kissinger is alsolinked to this group, reportedly after being recruited to a KGB homosexualblackmail ring focused on the EICOM G-2 headquarters in Oberammergau,Germany, at the end of the second world war. Kissinger was a member of theU.S. Army 970th Counterintelligence Corps, involved in creating the Nazi“rat lines” that enabled many prominent Nazis to escape prosecution at theend of World War II.Kissinger’s reported mentor was Fritz Kraemer of the Pentagon plansdivision, who also groomed Alexander Haig. Kraemer’s secret life duringWWII, according to deceased conspiracy researcher Mae Brussel, was that of aspecial lieutenant to Hitler. What does it matter whose side you are on, thecontrollers might say? Both sides in the World War, or for that matter theCold War, only served to foster the synthesis of the New World Order. [6]The principles that were agreed on at the Tavistock conference will soundvery familiar to those who have been following the reshaping of humaninstitutions and values by the New World Order. These include the beliefthat man should not dominate nature, but instead become a part of it, withno more rights and privileges than, say, the purple-assed baboon in thewild. Governments are obsolete and will be replaced by other, moreencompassing institutions. Mankind is moving into a deindustrializedpost-technological society, an “information age,” the Age of Aquarius:again, aborigines with laptop computers.The primary impetus towards the evolution to the post-technological societyare the repeated shocks and chaos taking place, including such events as theKennedy assassination, the Vietnam War, and the assault on traditionalinstitutions and thinking by the psychedelic counterculture.This philosophy was described exactly by Dr. William Sargent of theTavistock Institute in 1957 in his book Battle for the Mind—A Physiology ofConversion and Brain-Washing. Again, the idea is that the micro reflects themacro: the occultist dictum,“As above, so below.Sargent said, “Various types of beliefs can be implanted in many peopleafter brain function has been sufficiently disturbed by accidentally ordeliberately induced fear, anger, or excitement. Of the results caused bysuch disturbances, the most common one is temporarily impaired judgment andheightened suggestibility. Its various group manifestations are sometimesclassed under the heading of ‘herd instinct,’ and appear most spectacularlyin wartime, during severe epidemics, and in all similar periods of commondanger, which increase anxiety and so individual and mass suggestibility.”Out of the Tavistock conference also came Zbigniew Brzezinski’s 1968 bookThe Technotronic Age, that posits an information society whose basis ofcompetition is replaced by “amusement focus” based on “spectator spectacles(mass sports and TV) providing an opiate for increasingly purposelessmasses… New forms of social control may be needed to limit theindiscriminate exercise by the individual of their new powers. Thepossibility of extensive chemical mind control… will call for a socialdefinition of the common criteria of restraint as well as utilization. Andsome think that Guy DeBord’s Society of the Spectacle isn’t literal.In the Technotronic Age, the “nation state as a fundamental unit of man’sorganized life has ceased to be the principal creative force:International banks and multinational corporations are acting andplanning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of thenation-state.” Brzezinski also says of the “Technotronic Age” that, “At thesame time the capacity to assert social and political control over theindividual will vastly increase. It will soon be possible to assert almostcontinuous control over every citizen and to maintain up-to-date files,containing even the most personal details about health and personal behaviorof every citizen in addition to the more customary data.“These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.Power will gravitate into the hands of those who control information. Ourexisting institutions will be supplanted by pre-crisis managementinstitutions, the task of which will be to identify in advance likelysocial crises and to develop programs to cope with them.“This will encourage tendencies through the next several decades toward aTechnotronic Era, a dictatorship leaving even less room for politicalprocedures as we know them. Finally, looking ahead to the end of thecentury, the possibility of biochemical mind control and genetic tinkeringwith man, including beings which will function like men and reason like themas well, could give rise to some difficult questions.” A book written at thesame time by the conference chairman, Aurellio Peccei, was titled The ChasmAhead, and it too echoed the prevailing elitist themes: Peccei reiteratedthat a one-world government was the only solution to the problems of theworld. Also required was that Russia and the U.S. would have to enter intopartnership in global planning and enforcement—a theme that has becomeincreasingly obvious in recent years with the Spetznaz setting up shop inPeoria and Tulsa, and Clinton trying to lease the Long Beach Naval Yards tothe mainland Chinese. [7]One of the footsoldiers of Tavistock—currently fallen from grace at leastin the eyes of the American people—is, believe it or not, Newt Gingrich.The truth about Newt exists much in contradiction to his image as a staunchupholder of Republican ideals and conservative family values. Gingrich is infact another Trojan horse whose mentor is the “futurist” Alvin Toffler.Toffler’s book The Third Wave describes the current technocratic takeoverof the world, the acquisition of virtually all wealth by a tiny elite, andthe relegation of the vast majority of the populace to aThird World foragingin the garbage heaps of the rich.According to Gingrich, speaking to a crowd of yuppies at a congress on“Democracy in Virtual America,” “In the mid-to-late-‘60s, I read Drucker’sThe Age of Discontinuities, Boulding’s The Meaning of the Twentieth Century,Bell’s Beyond Post-Industrial Society—all of which were precursors to thefirst popularizer of this notion, which was Future Shock, which was writtenbasically a quarter of a century ago. Now, those four books describedeverything we’re living through for all practical purposes.., and nothinghas changed for a quarter of a century… I’ve worked with the Tofflers for20 years in trying to figure out this interesting question. Since this isall intellectually obvious, why can’t we break through?”Toffler is a protege of Kenneth Boulding, who is one of Tavistock’s leadinglights in the United States, and according to his wife founded therevolutionary Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Boulding and his wifewere responsible for much bridge building between the Fabian “societrists”of Tavistock and the New Left in the 1960s.Gingrich revealed his not-so-hidden roots when he mentioned the“anticipatory democracy” project in his introduction to The Third Wave.“A/D,” as it is termed, was a project fielded by Tavistock in the 1960sintended to bring about a New Age shift toward anything but traditionalvalues, unless it is the Wellsian “Open Conspiracy” traditional values ofthe elite controllers. Among the later projects that would be created byparticipants in the “A/D” project would be the Malthusian Club of Rome andthe Carter administration’s Global 2000 plan.Gingrich was ushered into the Tavistock orbit in 1965 when, as anundergraduate at Emery University, a professor at Georgia Tech introducedhim to the work of Boulding and Toffler. After getting his Ph.D. at Tulane,Gingrich took a teaching job at West Georgia State College, outside Atlanta,the East Coast node of the “humanist psychology movement.” One ofGingrich’s closest associates was the anything-but-Republican Jimmy Carter,who put Newt in charge of an A/D pilot project called Goals for Georgia. Itwas only later that Gingrich got his calling as a banner-waver for the NewRight. [8]NOTES:1. Dicks, Henry Victor, Fifty Years of the Tavistock Clinic.(London. England: Routledge & K.

Quote from: OG on September 13, 2009, 10:47:34 AMYes, in a way I do take it personally, but that is not different than an American jumping to the defence of the US when some one speaks ill of it. This atmoshpere of "lets blame the british" is unproductive, but then maybe it's supposed to be. Maybe you're supposed to just sit around moaning about things you cannot change rather than changing the things you have control over. @blowbackI've known a few times in recent history when the government has done what it wanted despite the queen being vocal about their decision. It didn't stop them, and the queen didn't stop them, because she cannot. Not any more. I think people mistake what juice the queen has as actual legally mandated power, it's not, she has none. Not here and certainly not in the US. The people with the real power in the US are you lot, the American people, but as long as you keep thinking otherwise, well, you'll get nowhere.I have one question...When did the royal families lose their power?You are saying "not any more". I am assuming at one time it was true and now you are putting forth the proposition "no longer is this true" in other words "at some point in time, or slowly over time this power has eroded or was taken away".If it would not be any trouble, I cannot find any evidence of this transition and suspect that the transition of power never occurred. Is there a way that you can lay those concerns to rest?

I think there is a misunderstanding here between British and American members of the board. Me being form the Uk I despise the Queen, I think she is the top of the power pyramid in the NWO if not one of the major players. Just because you do not see the queen's power that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. For example, Rothschild and Rockefeller are very good at disguising their wealth, creating dummy corporations and put boards of directors and even CEOs and everybody thinks that for example Bill gates owns Microsoft. Laughable!At the same time, people have to realise that:1) Many british can't stand the queen.2) We can get guns if it comes to that.3) We know what the deal is, are sick of Globalisation and the European Union.

Ok, I'm just going to say one thing. The British Royals (along with the other Bilderbergers) seem to have a lot of fun trying to get the public in America to want this:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_WarRather than having another one of these:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War, which they need desperately, both economically and for the psychological well-being of the country.And that's all I have to say about that.

By saying you support the house of windsor and the house of rothschild it becomes overtly obvious that you do not give a flying f**k about the people of britain. how can you tell me that you support the draconian and tyrannical police state set up by houses AND care about the people of Britain? How is that even possible? Stop working on behalf of the pharaoh to keep the slaves on both parts of the pond in intergenerational slavery...“You know, whenever Pharaoh wanted to prolong the period of slavery in Egypt, he had a favorite, favorite formula for doing it. What was that?He kept the slaves fighting amongst themselves.But whenever the slaves get together, that's the beginning of getting out of slavery.” —Martin Luther King, Jr.It is time for all of us to get together and stop buying into the ignorance of divisional hatred based on race/religion/nationality. That ignorance is the only thing allowing the Pharaohs, Kings, Elite Masters to continue ruling over us.

Quote from: mr_anderson on September 13, 2009, 08:56:25 AMI seriously don't get what the big deal is?It was a bad call, a bad reaction to a tight match. Am I missing something here? Mr. Anderson, and RickT,The point that is being made here, is this; Serena in this final match was defeating this young lady from Belgium... And in the final set, the final call was erroneous, blatantly so... and Serena expressed displeasure with the poor call in a typically American fashion... namely explaining to the line judge that she, Williams, should just shove this tennis ball down the line judge's throat.Within hours, literally hundreds of world press articles, running willy-nilly with this comment, touting Serena as everything from racist to attempting murder... Now who has the power to do that, especially when it's obvious that it was merely an "I'm pissed off," comment... and who are the reporters touting this? I wonder how many villas the royal houses of Europe have given away in the last 24 hours in order to get this accomplished...?Think about it, even Rep. Joe Wilson who called the president a liar didn't get that kind of horrific charge leveled against him... Ask yourself, what is the national sport of Queens...? Queen Bea called Queen Liz, to levy some racism of her own at Serena's comment... "We mustn't allow our beautiful blonde athlete, to be defeated on the world stage, by that dark rabble from America." Can't you just hear it. "How dare that slave subject address a representative of the Queen in such a fashion." All Serena did was express in as few words as possible her extreme displeasure with the call... that is something slaves are not supposed to do, light or dark.This understanding could be used by us as talking points with our buddies, who like to spend all their time at the bar watching sports... a method whereby we can awaken them to the New World Order... Let's please do take advantage of it, you will won't you...?And to all of our friends in the United Kingdom, including Britain, and our friends in Europe as well... it must be understood that we know that even during our War for Independence against Britain, not everyone there was behind the king in his "maintenance and expansion campaign" during the last quarter of the 18th century... there were even a few extremely well-placed dissenters...In England, politician and humorist Horace Walpole, a rebel sympathizer, upon receiving news of Bannister Tarlton's defeat at the hands of Daniel Morgan at Cowpens, made the following rye remark: "America once more is not quite ready to be conquered, although every now and again we fancy it is. Tarleton is defeated. Lord Cornwallis is checked. And Arnold not sure of having betrayed his friends too much purpose. ~Horace Walpole Essentially what I'm saying is this, there is nothing that promotes division better, than a poor call in a sporting match that is being watched worldwide. And in this case the Royals have taken advantage... We will now watch as the battle lines are drawn in every pub/bar/saloon/tennis club, in the world.--Oldyoti"What we meant, in going for those redcoats was this -- we had always governed ourselves, and always meant to... they, didn't mean we should." ~ An old New England militia captain, after the battles of Lexington and ConcordApril 19, 1775Click on Duke

Also if it would not be too much trouble, could the queen find it in her heart to end the Tavistock behavioural modification program that conditions children to commit suicide?Here is just one more in a long line of these "special projects on her majesty's secret service":---------------------------------------------Eight-year-old girl with learning difficulties found hanged in her bedroomhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/eightyearold-girl-found-hanged-in-her-bedroom-1786747.htmlBy Theo Usherwood, PA Sunday, 13 September 2009An eight-year-old girl was found hanged in her bedroom, police said today. The girl was found at her home in Moor Street, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, at about 9.15am yesterday. Detective Superintendent Adrian Pearson, head of Nottinghamshire Police's public protection unit, said: "We are investigating the full circumstances of this death with our colleagues at children and young people's services. "Detectives have interviewed both the girl's parents, while a five-year-old boy who was also living at the address has been taken into local authority care. "The inquiry is at a very early stage, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at present." A post-mortem examination carried out at Leicester Royal Infirmary last night confirmed the cause of the girl's death as hanging. Specialist police officers are working with social services at Nottinghamshire County Council to find out how the tragedy happened. Moor Street has now reopened following a full forensic examination of the scene, police added. Police said the girl's parents have not been arrested but were interviewed under caution. Sources refused to say whether the incident is being treated as suspicious or as a tragic accident. No one was in today at the rundown Edwardian terraced house in Moore Street, where the girl was found dead. There were two wheelie bins, one blue, one green, outside the front window of the house. The blinds were closed shut. There was also a wooden and glass cabinet standing outside the house. One woman, who did not want to be named, said: "I don't know the people myself but it's so sad what has happened." A 21-year-old student, who lives near to the house, said the girl suffered from learning difficulties. He said: "The girl and her brother never came out of the house. You never saw them really. The family are very quiet apart from a German shepherd in the back garden. I've been here a long time but they never really spoke to us, although they were all right to say hello to. Yesterday there were quite a few police cars here and a couple of ambulances and the doctors." He said the family had lived in the house for about six or seven years.
