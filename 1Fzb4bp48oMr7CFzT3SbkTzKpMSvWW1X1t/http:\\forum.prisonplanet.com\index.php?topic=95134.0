							<div class="post">National Level Exercise 2009 (NLE 09) is scheduled for July 27 through July 31, 2009. NLE 09 will be the first major exercise conducted by the United States government that will focus exclusively on terrorism prevention and protection, as opposed to incident response and recovery.<br /><br />NLE 09 is designated as a Tier I National Level Exercise. Tier I exercises (formerly known as the Top Officials exercise series or TOPOFF) are conducted annually in accordance with the National Exercise Program (NEP), which serves as the nation&#039;s overarching exercise program for planning, organizing, conducting and evaluating national level exercises. The NEP was established to provide the U.S. government, at all levels, exercise opportunities to prepare for catastrophic crises ranging from terrorism to natural disasters.<br /><br />NLE 09 is a White House directed, Congressionally- mandated exercise that includes the participation of all appropriate federal department and agency senior officials, their deputies, staff and key operational elements.&nbsp; In addition, broad regional participation of state, tribal, local, and private sector is anticipated.&nbsp; This year the United States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom in NLE 09. <br /><br />EXERCISE FOCUS<br /><br />NLE 09 will focus on intelligence and information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement communities, and between international, federal, regional, state, tribal, local and private sector participants.<br /><br />The NLE 09 scenario will begin in the aftermath of a notional terrorist event outside of the United States, and exercise play will center on preventing subsequent efforts by the terrorists to enter the United States and carry out additional attacks. This scenario enables participating senior officials to focus on issues related to preventing terrorist events domestically and protecting U.S. critical infrastructure.<br /><br />NLE 09 will allow terrorism prevention efforts to proceed to a logical end (successful or not), with no requirement for response or recovery activities. <br /><br />NLE 09 will be an operations-based exercise to include: activities taking place at command posts, emergency operation centers, intelligence centers and potential field locations to include federal headquarters facilities in the Washington D.C. area, and in federal, regional, state, tribal, local and private sector facilities in FEMA Region VI, which includes the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.<br /><br />EXERCISE OBJECTIVES<br /><br />Through a comprehensive evaluation process, the exercise will assess prevention and protection capabilities both nationally and regionally. Although NLE 09 is still in the planning stages, the exercise is currently designed to validate the following capabilities:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intelligence/Information Sharing and Dissemination<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Counter-Terrorism Investigation and Law Enforcement<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Air, Border and Maritime Security<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Critical Infrastructure Protection<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Public and Private Sector Alert/Notification and Security Advisories<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; International Coordination<br /><br />VALIDATING THE HOMELAND SECURITY SYSTEM<br /><br />Exercises such as NLE 09 are an important component of national preparedness, helping to build an integrated federal, state, tribal, local and private sector capability to prevent terrorist attacks, and rapidly and effectively respond to, and recover from, any terrorist attack or major disaster that occurs.<br /><br />The full-scale exercise offers agencies and jurisdictions a way to test their plans and skills in a real-time, realistic environment and to gain the in-depth knowledge that only experience can provide. Participants will exercise prevention and information sharing functions that are critical to preventing terrorist attacks. Lessons learned from the exercise will provide valuable insights to guide future planning for securing the nation against terrorist attacks, disasters, and other emergencies.<br /><br />For more information about NLE 09, contact the FEMA News Desk: 202-646-4600.<br />&nbsp;<br />FEMA leads and supports the nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation, to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the nation from all hazards including natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other man-made disasters.<br /><br />Could be a interesting summer!</div>

							<div class="post">Someone may have previously posted this item, but I heard Alex and Steve Quayle talking about this one today....<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fema.gov/media/fact_sheets/nle09.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.fema.gov/media/fact_sheets/nle09.shtm</a><br /><br />National Level Exercise 2009 (NLE 09)<br />National Level Exercise 2009 (NLE 09) is scheduled for July 27 through July 31, 2009. NLE 09 will be the first major exercise conducted by the United States government that will focus exclusively on terrorism prevention and protection, as opposed to incident response and recovery.<br /><br />NLE 09 is designated as a Tier I National Level Exercise. Tier I exercises (formerly known as the Top Officials exercise series or TOPOFF) are conducted annually in accordance with the National Exercise Program (NEP), which serves as the nation&#039;s overarching exercise program for planning, organizing, conducting and evaluating national level exercises. The NEP was established to provide the U.S. government, at all levels, exercise opportunities to prepare for catastrophic crises ranging from terrorism to natural disasters.<br /><br />NLE 09 is a White House directed, Congressionally- mandated exercise that includes the participation of all appropriate federal department and agency senior officials, their deputies, staff and key operational elements.&nbsp; In addition, broad regional participation of state, tribal, local, and private sector is anticipated.&nbsp; This year the United States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom in NLE 09. <br /><br />EXERCISE FOCUS<br /><br />NLE 09 will focus on intelligence and information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement communities, and between international, federal, regional, state, tribal, local and private sector participants.<br /><br />The NLE 09 scenario will begin in the aftermath of a notional (sp) terrorist event outside of the United States, and exercise play will center on preventing subsequent efforts by the terrorists to enter the United States and carry out additional attacks. This scenario enables participating senior officials to focus on issues related to preventing terrorist events domestically and protecting U.S. critical infrastructure.<br /><br />NLE 09 will allow terrorism prevention efforts to proceed to a logical end (successful or not), with no requirement for response or recovery activities. <br /><br />NLE 09 will be an operations-based exercise to include: activities taking place at command posts, emergency operation centers, intelligence centers and potential field locations to include federal headquarters facilities in the Washington D.C. area, and in federal, regional, state, tribal, local and private sector facilities in FEMA Region VI, which includes the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.<br /><br />EXERCISE OBJECTIVES<br /><br />Through a comprehensive evaluation process, the exercise will assess prevention and protection capabilities both nationally and regionally. Although NLE 09 is still in the planning stages, the exercise is currently designed to validate the following capabilities:<br /><br />Intelligence/Information Sharing and Dissemination<br />Counter-Terrorism Investigation and Law Enforcement<br />Air, Border and Maritime Security<br />Critical Infrastructure Protection<br />Public and Private Sector Alert/Notification and Security Advisories<br />International Coordination<br />VALIDATING THE HOMELAND SECURITY SYSTEM<br /><br />Exercises such as NLE 09 are an important component of national preparedness, helping to build an integrated federal, state, tribal, local and private sector capability to prevent terrorist attacks, and rapidly and effectively respond to, and recover from, any terrorist attack or major disaster that occurs.<br /><br />The full-scale exercise offers agencies and jurisdictions a way to test their plans and skills in a real-time, realistic environment and to gain the in-depth knowledge that only experience can provide. Participants will exercise prevention and information sharing functions that are critical to preventing terrorist attacks. Lessons learned from the exercise will provide valuable insights to guide future planning for securing the nation against terrorist attacks, disasters, and other emergencies.<br /><br />For more information about NLE 09, contact the FEMA News Desk: 202-646-4600.<br />&nbsp;<br />FEMA leads and supports the nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation, to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the nation from all hazards including natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other man-made disasters.<br /><br />Last Modified: Wednesday, 11-Mar-2009 08:04:00 EDT<br /></div>

Tier II Exercises are focused on strategy and policy issues supported by all appropriate departments and agencies either through the National Simulation Cell or as determined by each department or agency&#039;s leadership. (Tier II exercises are endorsed through the NEP process as meriting priority for interagency participation.&nbsp; Tier II exercises take precedence over Tier III exercises in the event of resource conflicts.&nbsp; The E&amp;E sub-PCC shall recommend no more than three Tier II exercises for interagency participation annually )<br />Tier III Exercises (Permitted). Tier III Exercises are other Federal exercises focused on operational, tactical, or organization-specific objectives and not requiring broad interagency headquarters-level involvement to achieve their stated exercise or training objectives.&nbsp; Participation is at the discretion of each department or agency.&nbsp; <br />Tier IV Exercises.&nbsp; &nbsp;Tier IV Exercises are exercises in which State, territorial, local, and/or tribal governments, and/or private sector entities, are the primary training audience or subject of evaluation. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />NLE Tier I exercise will have a single focus/ scenario/ control - Therefore, the NEP has to have interagency ownership.&nbsp; <br />DHS chaired NEP Executive Steering Committee supports day-to-day coordination and staff work for the NEP<br />DHS (chair), DOD, DOE, HHS, DOJ, DOS, DOT, ODNI, FBI<br />Up to three rotating members (1-year term)<br />HSC, NSC, OMB representatives in non-voting oversight capacity <br />The NEP ESC will coordinate Department/Agency, as well as Regional/State/local exercise requirements/objectives and build a recommended NEP Five-Year Exercise Schedule. <br />The NEP ESC will also prioritize recommended lessons learned and corrective action plans.<br /><br /><br />The recommended NEP Five-Year Exercise Schedule and Corrective Action Plan are submitted to the Deputies for approval via the Disaster Readiness Group (DRG) Exercise and Evaluation Sub-Policy Coordination Committee (E&amp;E sub-PCC) to frame those decisions <br />Bridge the gap between Federal and State/local exercises<br />Coordinate Federal, State, &amp; local exercise objectives and priorities<br />State/local exercises<br />Regional exercises<br />Federal exercises<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Every four years the Federal Government experiences an election cycle that could result in a change of leadership.<br />The nation and the Federal Government is venerable during this transition as senior leadership assumes their new responsibilities.<br />In coordination with a series of transition briefings and seminars, National Exercise Program NLEs, PLEs and Tier II exercises will support this transition. <br /><br />NEP exercises will support a better understanding of:<br />USG policies, plans, capabilities<br />Incident management and crisis coordination procedures and challenges<br /><br /><br />Following NEP implementation plan procures a review of national priorities and current threats identified prevention and border security as top priorities for a national level exercise.<br /><br />A terrorism focused, prevention exercise will allow senior leadership at all levels address emerging national-level policy issues centered on:<br />Intelligence and Information Sharing and Dissemination<br />Counter-Terror Investigation and Law Enforcement<br />Border and Maritime Security<br />Homeland Security Advisory System<br />Critical Infrastructure Protection<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />PLE 3-09 will link to NLE 09 and use the same scenario.<br />PLE 3-09 will allow senior leadership to discuss issues related to the overseas incident while addressing the credible threat to the U.S. Homeland.<br />The NLE 09 Scenario would build off a significant international venue terrorist incident and a credible threat against the U.S. Homeland.<br />NLE 09 will address primarily prevention and protection focused issues, with limited response or recovery issues.<br />Conducting NLE 09 as a prevention focused exercise will allow for wider State/local participation than past TOPOFF exercises.<br /><br />The NLE 09 planning timeline is similar to past TOPOFF exercises.<br />An 18-month cycle will include a series of HSEEP planning meetings as well as national level seminars that educate participants on the issues related to the scenario.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>This slide lays out the FY 09-13 NLEs and PLEs.</b><br /><br />A coordinated interagency exercise program requires common vocabulary and standardized processes for exercise activity. The HSEEP policy and guidance documents provide the doctrinal foundation for all tiers of NEP exercise activity. The NEP supplements the doctrine for NEP Tier I exercises. For example, aspects of national-level exercises (NLEs) (refer to section 5.9) associated with resourcing and exercise life cycles will be determined by consensus at the Concept Development Conference for each NLE. <br /><br />Design, Development, and Conduct. HSEEP Policy and Guidance shall serve as doctrine for design, development, and conduct of NEP exercises. In those instances when DoD participates in an NLE, DoD and DHS doctrine will be integrated as agreed at the Concept Development Conference, based on specific exercise requirements. Application of HSEEP Policy and Guidance to NEP Tier I exercises is described in the following sections.&nbsp; <br /><br />NLE Timeline. HSEEP recommends a minimum of nine months from development of a budget and planning team to publication of an After Action Report (AAR), and up to five planning conferences, for an operations-based exercise. For purposes of the NEP, the planning timeline for the NLE will begin approximately 15 months prior to exercise conduct. <br /><br />Confirmation of NLE Executive Steering Committee (NLE ESC). Approximately 15 months prior to NLE conduct, the NEP ESC will confirm the initial composition and chair of the NLE ESC. The NLE ESC may be identical to the NEP ESC, a subset of the NEP ESC, or designees of the NEP ESC departments and agencies. <br /><br />Concept and Objectives Meeting (C&amp;O). Approximately 14 months prior to NLE conduct, the NLE ESC will hold a C&amp;O Meeting. The C&amp;O Meeting will ensure understanding of guidance provided in the five-year schedule regarding objectives and scenario parameters, and begin the process of developing additional detail. The C&amp;O Meeting also will begin to address the structure and composition of an Integrated Planning Team for the NLE. The NLE ESC will brief the Secretary of Homeland Security on the results of the concept development process, and obtain concurrence on the concept, goals and objectives, prior to the Initial Planning Conference (IPC) and prior to any final agreement with State, local, territorial, tribal or private sector participants. <br /><br />Initial Planning Conference (IPC). Approximately 11 months prior to NLE conduct, the NLE ESC will hold an IPC. <br /><br />Midterm Planning Conference (MPC). Approximately six months prior to NLE conduct, the NLE ESC will hold an MPC. <br /><br />Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) Conference. Approximately four months prior to NLE conduct, the NLE ESC will hold a MSEL Conference if the NLE ESC believes one is needed. <br /><br />Final Planning Conference (FPC). Approximately two months prior to NLE conduct, the NLE ESC will hold an FPC. <br /><br />PLE Timeline. HSEEP recommends a minimum of seven months from development of a budget and planning team to publication of an After Action Report (AAR), and two planning conferences, for a discussion-based exercise. For purposes of the NEP, the planning timeline for a PLE will begin approximately six months prior to exercise conduct. HSEEP Volumes III and IV provide additional detail on the subject. <br /><br />C&amp;O Meeting. DHS will lead planning of the PLE effort at the direction of the HSC and NSC. Approximately six months prior to PLE conduct, DHS will meet with the Decision Authority for the PLE (e.g., APNSA, APHS/CT), or designee, to confirm objectives and design parameters for the PLE, based on guidance contained in the five-year schedule.&nbsp; <br /><br />IPC. Approximately four months prior to PLE conduct, DHS, in consultation with the HSC and NSC staffs, will facilitate an IPC. Initial exercise materials will be presented for discussion. <br /><br />FPC. Approximately two months prior to PLE conduct, DHS, in consultation with the HSC and NSC staffs will facilitate an FPC.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) is a capabilities and performance-based exercise program which provides a standardized policy, methodology, and terminology for exercise design, development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning. The HSEEP Policy and Guidance is presented in detail in HSEEP Volumes I-III. Adherence to the policy and guidance presented in the HSEEP Volumes ensures that exercise programs conform to established best practices, and helps provide unity and consistency of effort for exercises at all levels of government. <br /><br />The HSEEP website, <a href="http://hseep.dhs.gov" target="_blank">http://hseep.dhs.gov</a>, provides additional information regarding HSEEP Policy and Guidance. Available on the website are the revised versions of HSEEP Volumes I-III, which provide detail and context regarding many of the terms, processes, and requirements described above.&nbsp; Volume IV is a searchable library that provides many of the sample materials described above. The HSEEP Toolkit, which includes the National Exercise Schedule (NEXS) System, Design and Development System (DDS), and Corrective Action Program (CAP) System, allows users to schedule, plan, evaluate and track corrective actions from exercises. In addition, there are several exercise training courses, including independent study (IS-120a, IS-130, etc.), mobile (HSEEP Mobile Course), and residence courses (Master Exercise Practitioner Program) that teach students the principles of exercise planning, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning. <br />&nbsp;<br /><hr /><hr /><br /><div align="center"><b><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: 20pt; line-height: 1.3em;">HSEEP COMPLIANCE</span></span></b></div><br /><b>1. HSEEP Compliance is defined as adherence to specific HSEEP mandated practices for exercise program management, design, development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning. In order for an entity to be considered HSEEP compliant it must satisfy four distinct performance requirements: Conducting an annual Training and Exercise Plan Workshop and developing and maintaining a Multi-year Training and Exercise Plan.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Planning and conducting exercises in accordance with the guidelines set forth in HSEEP Volumes I-III. </b><br /><br /><b>Exercise Planning and Conduct</b><br /><br />&#9632; The type of exercise selected by the entity should be consistent with the entity&#8217;s Multi-year Training and Exercise Plan.<br /><br />&#9632; Exercise objectives should be based on capabilities and their associated critical tasks, which are contained within the EEGs. For example, if an entity, based on its risk/vulnerability analysis, determines that it is prone to hurricanes, it may want to validate its evacuation capabilities. In order to validate this capability it would first refer to the &#8220;Citizen Protection: Evacuation and/or In- Place Protection&#8221; EEG. Tasks associated with this capability include: &#8220;make the decision to evacuate or shelter in place;&#8221; &#8220;identify and mobilize appropriate personnel;&#8221; and &#8220;activate approved traffic control plan.&#8221; An entity may wish to create its own Simple, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Task-oriented (S.M.A.R.T.) objectives based on its specific plans/procedures associated with these capabilities and tasks, such as: 1) &quot;Examine the ability of local response agencies to conduct mass evacuation procedures in accordance with Standard Operating Procedures; and 2) Evaluate the ability of local response agencies to issue public notification of an evacuation order within the timeframe prescribed in local Standard Operating Procedures.<br /><br />&#9632; The scenarios used in exercises must be tailored toward validating the capabilities, and should be based on the entity&#8217;s risk/vulnerability assessment.<br /><br />&#9632; Exercise planners should develop the following documents, in accordance with HSEEP Volume IV, to support exercise planning, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning:<br /><br />&#9632; For Discussion-based Exercises:<br />- Situation Manual (SITMAN)<br /><br />&#9632; For Operations-based Exercises this requires:<br />- Exercise Plan (EXPLAN)<br />- Player Handout<br />- Master Scenario Events List (MSEL)<br />- Controller/Evaluator Handbook (C/E Handbook)<br />Templates and samples of these documents can be found in HSEEP Volume IV: Sample Templates and Formats, available on the HSEEP website (<a href="http://hseep.dhs.gov" target="_blank">http://hseep.dhs.gov</a>).<br /><br />&#9632; Exercises should adhere to the planning timelines laid forth in HSEEP Volume I.<br /><br />&#9632; Exercises must reflect the principles of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). <br /><br /><b>3. Developing and submitting a properly formatted After-Action Report/Improvement Plan (AAR/IP). The format for the AAR/IP is found in HSEEP Volume III. <br /><br />After-Action Reporting</b><br /><br />&#9632; AAR/IPs created for exercises must conform to the templates provided in HSEEP Volume III: Exercise Evaluation and Improvement Planning.<br /><br />&#9632; Following each exercise, a draft AAR/IP must be developed based on information gathered through use of Exercise Evaluation Guides (EEGs).<br /><br />&#9632; Following every exercise, an After-Action Conference (AAC) must be conducted, in which:<br />- Key personnel and the exercise planning team are presented with findings and recommendations from the draft AAR/IP.<br />- Corrective actions addressing a draft AAR/IP&#8217;s recommendations are developed and assigned to responsible parties with due dates for completion.<br /><br />&#9632; A final AAR/IP with recommendations and corrective actions derived from discussion at the AAC must be completed within 60 days after the completion of each exercise. <br /><br /><b>4. Tracking and implementing corrective actions identified in the AAR/IP. <br /><br />Improvement Planning</b><br /><br />&#9632; An improvement plan will include broad recommendations from the AAR/IP organized by target capability as defined in the Target Capabilities List (TCL).<br /><br />&#9632; Corrective actions derived from an AAC are associated with the recommendations and must be linked to a capability element as defined in the TCL.<br /><br />&#9632; Corrective actions included in the improvement plan must be measurable.<br /><br />&#9632; Corrective actions included in the improvement plan must designate a projected start date and completion date.<br /><br />&#9632; Corrective actions included in the improvement plan must be assigned to an organization and a point of contact (POC) within that organization.<br /><br />&#9632; Corrective actions must be continually monitored and reviewed as part of an organizational Corrective Action Program. An individual should be responsible for managing a Corrective Action Program to ensure corrective actions resulting from exercises, policy discussions and real-world events are resolved and support the scheduling and development of subsequent training and exercises. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Training and Exercise Plan Workshop (T&amp;EPW)</b><br /><br />&#9632; All HSEEP compliant entities conduct a T&amp;EPW each calendar year in which they develop a Multi-year Training and Exercise Plan, which includes:<br /><br />&#9632; The entities&#8217; training and exercise priorities (based on an overarching strategy and previous improvement plans).<br /><br />&#9632; The capabilities from the TCL that the entity will train for and exercise against.<br /><br />&#9632; A multi-year training and exercise schedule which:<br />- Reflects the training activities which will take place prior to an exercise, allowing exercises to serve as a true validation of previous training.<br />- Reflects all exercises in which the entity participates.<br />- Employs a &#8220;building-block approach&#8221; in which training and exercise activities gradually escalate in complexity.<br /><br />&#9632; A new or updated Multi-year Training and Exercise Plan must be finalized and implemented within 60 days of the T&amp;EPW.<br /><br />&#9632; All scheduled exercises must be entered into the National Exercise Schedule (NEXS) System.<br /><br />&#9632; The Multi-Year Training and Exercise Plan must be updated on an annual basis (or as necessary) to reflect schedule changes. <br />&nbsp;<br /><hr /><br /><b>Exercise Types</b><br /><br />There are seven types of exercises defined within HSEEP, each of which is either discussions-based or operations-based. Discussions-based Exercises familiarize participants with current plans, policies, agreements and procedures, or may be used to develop new plans, policies, agreements, and procedures. Types of Discussion-based Exercises include:<br /><br />&#9632; Seminar. A seminar is an informal discussion, designed to orient participants to new or updated plans, policies, or procedures (e.g., a seminar to review a new Evacuation Standard Operating Procedure).<br /><br />&#9632; Workshop. A workshop resembles a seminar, but is employed to build specific products, such as a draft plan or policy (e.g., a Training and Exercise Plan Workshop is used to develop a Multi-year Training and Exercise Plan).<br /><br />&#9632; Tabletop Exercise (TTX). A tabletop exercise involves key personnel discussing simulated scenarios in an informal setting. TTXs can be used to assess plans, policies, and procedures.<br /><br />&#9632; Game. A game is a simulation of operations that often involves two or more teams, usually in a competitive environment, using rules, data, and procedure designed to depict an actual or assumed real-life situation. Operations-based Exercises validate plans, policies, agreements and procedures, clarify roles and responsibilities, and identify resource gaps in an operational environment. Types of Operations-based<br /><br /><b>Exercises include:</b><br /><br />&#9632; Drill. A drill is a coordinated, supervised activity usually employed to test a single, specific operation or function within a single entity (e.g., a fire department conducts a decontamination drill).<br /><br />&#9632; Functional Exercise (FE). A functional exercise examines and/or validates the coordination, command, and control between various multi-agency coordination centers (e.g., emergency operation center, joint field office, etc.). A functional exercise does not involve any &quot;boots on the ground&quot; (i.e., first responders or emergency officials responding to an incident in real time).<br /><br />&#9632; Full-Scale Exercise (FSE). A full-scale exercise is a multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional, multidiscipline exercise involving functional (e.g., joint field office, emergency operation centers, etc.) and &quot;boots on the ground&quot; response (e.g., firefighters decontaminating mock victims). <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Planning and After Action Conferences<br /><br />The HSEEP methodology defines a variety of planning and after action conferences. The need for each of these conferences varies depending on the type and scope of the exercise. They include:</b><br /><br />&#9632; Concepts and Objectives Meeting<br /><br />&#9632; Initial Planning Conference (IPC)<br /><br />&#9632; Mid-Term Planning Conference (MPC)<br /><br />&#9632; Master Scenario Events List (MSEL) Conference<br /><br />&#9632; Final Planning Conference (FPC)<br /><br />&#9632; After Action Conference (AAC) <br /><br /><b>HSEEP Volume II: Exercise Planning and Conduct&nbsp; provides detail on the outcomes, products, and associated timelines for each of these planning conferences. </b><br />&nbsp;<br />The National Preparedness System meets the requirement in HSPD-8 for &#8220;elements that support the national preparedness goal including ...a system for assessing the Nation&#8217;s overall preparedness to respond to major events, especially those involving acts of terrorism.&#8221;&nbsp; <br /><br />The National Preparedness System provides the tools and processes to realign existing programs and efforts to support the National Preparedness Goal.&nbsp; Many processes already being performed by States, local, and tribal entities under current Federal grant programs are well suited to the National Preparedness System and will be retained.&nbsp; The System adds important tools to enhance these processes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The System has four main components.&nbsp; Each provides opportunities for all levels of government to communicate and collaborate on achieving the Goal.&nbsp; Many actions will be concurrent.&nbsp; They are described sequentially for ease of understanding:<br /><br />Strategic Direction, which involves development of the National Preparedness Goal, including a capabilities-based framework to support the Goal; issuance of National Preparedness Guidance; and alignment of preparedness programs and efforts throughout the homeland security community to support the Goal.&nbsp; <br /><br />Planning and Resource Allocation, which involves application of scenario-based analysis, capabilities-based planning, and portfolio management techniques to determine needs and allocate resources to build capabilities that are prioritized based upon risk.<br /><br />Execution, which involves demonstration of capability through performance-based training and exercises, and evaluation of performance to identify lessons learned, share best practices, and update improvement plans.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Feedback, which involves assessment and reporting on progress and effectiveness of efforts throughout the system to achieve the National Preparedness Goal.&nbsp; </div>

NLE 09 will be the first major exercise conducted by the United States government that will focus exclusively on terrorism prevention and protection, as opposed to incident response and recovery.<br /><br />NLE 09 is designated as a Tier I National Level Exercise. Tier I exercises (formerly known as the Top Officials exercise series or TOPOFF) are conducted annually in accordance with the National Exercise Program (NEP), which serves as the nation&#039;s overarching exercise program for planning, organizing, conducting and evaluating national level exercises. The NEP was established to provide the U.S. government, at all levels, exercise opportunities to prepare for catastrophic crises ranging from terrorism to natural disasters.<br /><br />NLE 09 is a White House directed, Congressionally- mandated exercise that includes the participation of all appropriate federal department and agency senior officials, their deputies, staff and key operational elements. In addition, broad regional participation of state, tribal, local, and private sector is anticipated. This year the United States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom in NLE 09. <br /><br />EXERCISE FOCUS<br /><br />NLE 09 will focus on intelligence and information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement communities, and between international, federal, regional, state, tribal, local and private sector participants.<br /><br />The NLE 09 scenario will begin in the aftermath of a notional terrorist event outside of the United States, and exercise play will center on preventing subsequent efforts by the terrorists to enter the United States and carry out additional attacks. This scenario enables participating senior officials to focus on issues related to preventing terrorist events domestically and protecting U.S. critical infrastructure.<br /><br />NLE 09 will allow terrorism prevention efforts to proceed to a logical end (successful or not), with no requirement for response or recovery activities. <br /><br />NLE 09 will be an operations-based exercise to include: activities taking place at command posts, emergency operation centers, intelligence centers and potential field locations to include federal headquarters facilities in the Washington D.C. area, and in federal, regional, state, tribal, local and private sector facilities in FEMA Region VI, which includes the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.<br /><br />EXERCISE OBJECTIVES<br /><br />Through a comprehensive evaluation process, the exercise will assess prevention and protection capabilities both nationally and regionally. Although NLE 09 is still in the planning stages, the exercise is currently designed to validate the following capabilities:<br /><br />Intelligence/Information Sharing and Dissemination<br />Counter-Terrorism Investigation and Law Enforcement<br />Air, Border and Maritime Security<br />Critical Infrastructure Protection<br />Public and Private Sector Alert/Notification and Security Advisories<br />International Coordination<br />VALIDATING THE HOMELAND SECURITY SYSTEM<br /><br />Exercises such as NLE 09 are an important component of national preparedness, helping to build an integrated federal, state, tribal, local and private sector capability to prevent terrorist attacks, and rapidly and effectively respond to, and recover from, any terrorist attack or major disaster that occurs.<br /><br />The full-scale exercise offers agencies and jurisdictions a way to test their plans and skills in a real-time, realistic environment and to gain the in-depth knowledge that only experience can provide. Participants will exercise prevention and information sharing functions that are critical to preventing terrorist attacks. Lessons learned from the exercise will provide valuable insights to guide future planning for securing the nation against terrorist attacks, disasters, and other emergencies.<br /><br />For more information about NLE 09, contact the FEMA News Desk: 202-646-4600.<br /><br />FEMA leads and supports the nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation, to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the nation from all hazards including natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other man-made disasters.<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/search?pz=1&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=NLE+09&amp;btnmeta%3Dsearch%3Dsearch=Search+the+Web" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/search?pz=1&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=NLE+09&amp;btnmeta%3Dsearch%3Dsearch=Search+the+Web</a></div>

Albany was an important port for the ANZAC�s as it was the last sight of Australia the ANZAC�s enjoyed before arriving in the Middle East for World War I.<br /><br />Deployment highlights will include a visit to New York, Baltimore and Norfolk in reciprocation of the 2008 United States Navy (USN) Great White Fleet celebrations in Australia. Both ships will also pay a special visit to Ferrol, Spain (the home of Navantia Shipbuilding) to see first hand the development of the Royal Australian Navy�s highly anticipated new Landing Helicopter Dock ships. <br /><br /></div>

							<div class="post">This is a PM conversation that I had on another board back on Mar 25, 2009. Maybe this is relevant here.<br /><br /><b>LFS:</b>My old college roommate is and has been in the CIA for quite a while. I talked to him today to get his take on the male populace of at least the South basically beginning doomsday scenario preparations. He feigned to have never heard of such a thing, but then slipped up and referred to it as &quot;the insurgency&quot;. He claims &quot;they are just studying about that now&quot; and are practicing insurgency, counter insurgency scenarios in the school he is in. He also made reference to how this, if it manifested, would be a law enforcement issue. I suggested that the definition of law enforcement will likely be changing, coming direct from Obama&#039;s mouth, to a domestic military force. He laughed that one off. He asked what I thought the catalyst was, and I said it was the ultimate demise of the dollar. Then he asked why would I think that, and I said printing 1 trillion dollars the other day was going to get us there. He said yes, but was it put into circulation? And I did not know that answer and he went on to say that the federal reserve is not that stupid to crash the dollar like that. And I told him, not unless they wanted to.<br /><br />All in all, he played dumb, but knew exactly what I was talking about. Finally I told him, if you want to make this stop, have the federal government give us our country back. Stop the spending. Stop the financial destruction of our country. You do that, and the resentment goes away. He let down his guard a little and somberly said that he has been warning his colleagues that this country was founded by an insurgent force and can be taken down by an insurgent force.<br /><br />They know and they are prepping for us. They are treating people making these preparations like enemies of the nation. It is worse than I thought.<br /><br /><b>ME:</b>What difference is it that the money was put in to circulation? Here it is, they are printing 1 trillion a day and giving the bill to the taxpayers, the rest of the world is not buying our debt any more and the Federal Reserve is propping up the dollar by buying our own t-bills. Then they are handing it out to their cronies to spend on anything they want, corporations, infrastructure, etc.<br /><br />Most of our currency is held overseas almost 70% of it. Now that they&#039;ve stopped buying our debt you will start to see that money come in to circulation and that&#039;s when you&#039;ll see the dollar collapse. The g-20 summit is coming up and you&#039;ll see them announce a world bank that everybody will pay their taxes to and a world government that will regulate everybody. These globalist bastards are moving at breakneck speed now, they know they are being exposed so they are making their move.<br /><br />Let me tell you something about the CIA. They are an offshore corporation that the federal government holds stock in. They were controlled by American corporations but now those corporations are global so their interests have changed. They run drugs to fund illegal wars, they also infiltrate and destroy any competition for those global corporations.<br /><br />They helped stage 9/11. LFS, I should be struck blind so that I will never see my children again, I believe this to my very core. All the evidence points towards it, CIA section chiefs have came out and said inside job. You have to understand these globalists are mass murders, they created Hitler, Poa, Stalin. They destroy countries, they bankrupt nations, they are thieves. Look at Argentina, it was as wealthy as the US and in 2 weeks they went to dirt poor.<br /><br />The Mandatory National Service Act has passed the Senate and is about to become law. That means they will come for our children and force them in to the military. Everyone from the age of 15-65 will be forced to serve the government, it is slavery. For those Obama zombies, it will be like the Stazi, secret police. The only other place they have done something like this is Communist Germany, Soviet Russia, Hitlers Germany and Pao&#039;s China.<br /><br />The hour is late, I would love for you to keep talking to him, keep asking him, see if he&#039;ll say anything else. Talk to him about all the military and police that see what&#039;s happening and don&#039;t like it. Anything else you can remember I&#039;d appreciate it.<br /><b><br />LFS:</b>I have known him long enough (20+ years) to know when he is full of diddly poo. Today, he was full of it. Last time I saw him (5 years ago), he looked completely Arab. When I asked him what he is doing now, all he said it has to do with Gitmo. I mentioned at the time that my Dad was living in the same neighborhood as Chavez...and he said instinctually &quot;within gun range?&quot; So I jokingly said, so what does it cost to off a dictator now a days? He immediately got a glossed over look and chanted some crap about the CIA does not perform assassinations anymore, blah blah rehearsed blah blah.<br /><br />I know this much, he is supposed to take a foreign assignment before the end of year. He said he is not allowed to watch the news...I found that odd. He also called me last week to get my take on current energy sources and our private sector&#039;s ability to move to alternate fuel sources. Said it was a class assignment, yet turns around and says they are practicing insurgency stuff. He totally downplayed the devaluation of the dollar, and said well maybe slightly. And he said that everyone&#039;s reaction is to be expected because when you &quot;turn people&#039;s social status and position on it&#039;s head&quot; people will go into survival mode and &quot;that the white male has always ruled this country until now and people can&#039;t deal with that&quot;. I said this is not a racial issue, it is a federal gov issue. They have too much power and are destroying our economy. Then he said, the people in this country just don&#039;t know how lucky they have had it for as long as they have (looking down his nose like). &quot;They can not expect prosperity forever.&quot;<br /><br />Then he also went on about how he doesn&#039;t understand retiree&#039;s of today. They could go back to work like &quot;everyone else in the world&quot;.<br /><br />But then he counters that with how pissed off he and his &quot;counterparts&quot; were at the grilling of the AIG CEO the other day. He was saying they were like, &quot;show some sack and tell them to fark themselves.&quot; I think that CEO is their plant. His tone was personal.<br /><br />Ultimately, he was very cautious in his wording and stopped himself several times. I too was guarded and cautious and he knew that as well. But we both played long lost buddy on the phone. I really wanted to pass a message to him that you guys aren&#039;t fooling us, and you will be up against a fight if you go through with it. Obviously, I did not say that out right, but he knew what I was saying. I know I am taking a risk, but keep your enemies closer...<br /><br /><b>ME:</b>Not allowed to watch the news. This was confirmed by someone else the other day that called in to the Alex Jones radio show, saying that they knew someone in the CIA and that some of them knew that the country was going to hell in a hand basket and that they weren&#039;t allowed to watch the news.<br /><br />It is because their government handlers can&#039;t trust them with their own mind. They aren&#039;t supposed to be able to have free thought. They are programed, brainwashed. You think that movie with Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a government assassin was fake? They have been programed and the feds are vamping up for the white people to be the bad guys, because they know we&#039;re the ones that wont allow this country to fall as we&#039;re the majority. They started last year announcing on the news that alCIAda was blond haired and blue eyed, to that MIAC report in Missouri talking about militia groups and anyone who had a Ron Paul bumpersticker was a cop killer.<br /><br />These guys are conditioned, they are trained to lie. And you have confirmed what I told you, that they are just regulators for global corporations. Do you know what a regulator is? They were just an armed mob that were sent out by company owners to bust up labor strikes or to take land or cattle and were involved in a lot of massacares. One of the most known was Pinkerton, who created a business out of it and called it a private investigater business that the modern day FBI was molded after.<br /><br /><b>LFS:</b>So is the info I got helpful? It wasn&#039;t what he said, it was what was between the lines. 95percent of people would not have caught what I did, but I have a very unusual ability to read body language, voice inflection, pauses, and word choice into alternate meanings that are more true than what they are saying. I attribute it to growing up with a pack of dogs as my best friends being very isolated in the country (sounds crazy, but that is how they read us and I learned to use it to communicate to them). But I digress. I feigned concern while talking to him and wanted to let him know because it worried me. I was just looking for reaction. He didn&#039;t think he gave me one, but slipped several times with tiny tidbits. Every time he slipped, his old voice came out, which was likely reality. When he said the stuff about prosperity, etc., that was propaganda that he totally believes to be true (but his core has doubts and was forceful as if he had to be forceful with himself).<br /><br />Much of what you say, I have a hard time believing. But your consistency tells me your core believes it. That has kept me interested.<br /><br />I don&#039;t plan on going to the well too much with him. But am I in danger for what I have done/said so far? Honestly, I feel the call to arms in my gut...like a patriot. I also don&#039;t expect to live through it all either, honestly, and I am OK with that. I just hope my family does.<br /><br />&quot;Breakneck speed&quot; reminded me of another thing he said. He said our situation was an insurgency. And he said one of the greatest insurgencies was the vietcong and they ultimately won for one reason only, time. They were inferior in every way but had all the time in world to wait us out.<br /><br /><b>ME:</b>Was the info helpful? It was very interesting and validated a lot of what I already knew. I appriciate it greatly.<br /><br />In order for you to start believing everything that I say, you must start with DC Organic Act of February 21, 1871. It is where the unratified Constitution of 1787 which was without the Bill of Rights, became the law of the federal government. This Act set up the DC Corporate government, in a capacity of control, and separate from the United States of America, and We The People.<br /><br />Then in 1933 the US went banktrupt. We were put in to receivership by Congress to the international bankers. Our income tax system was set, social security numbers were issued and we The People were put up as colateral for that debt, paying it off with the income tax through the offshore corporation know as the IRS, to which the ATF is the enforcement arm, which is also set up as an offshore corporation. The US government, the one that is the District of Columbia holds shares of the stock in these corporations, they are not a part of the government as you think they are. Do the reasearch, find it out for yourself. You have to come to grips with this before everything else falls in to place. It&#039;s a hard pill to swallow. I will leave you some links, take your time and expand upon that.<br /><br />And no, I don&#039;t think you endangered yourself for what you have done. You can see his gut, his soul knows that what they are telling him is some how wrong. Honestly it maybe you that helps turn the tide in his mind. That maybe a greater feat than dieing on the battlefield, because he may change his fellow agents minds.<br /><br />That&#039;s what has woken up a lot of these police and military, is that they&#039;ve started to get the same federalized training and know it not to be true. Just like the MIAC report says, the North American Union doesn&#039;t exist, the new world order doesn&#039;t exist, the federal reserve is good, any one who has a Ron Paul sticker, who voted for Bob Barr. They read this and thought it was ridiculous and leaked the report out to Alex Jones and in one week the story was global.<br /><br />In this video, Footage of a FEMA Instructor teaching police and firefighters that the &quot;Founding Fathers were terrorist,&quot; and demonizing Christians and patriots.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XC1fk_EO3c" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XC1fk_EO3c</a><br /><br />Also I wouldn&#039;t worry about fighting and dieing, if you coward and do nothing then you are already dead. I put my fate in God&#039;s hands, pray that I&#039;m able to carry this fight and my wife and children get spared but if something happens to them then it is the evil that has done it and it&#039;s God&#039;s will. But I will not compromise, I will not give in because to do so is almost guaranteeing that we all shall perish.<br /><br />Here are some links for DC Organic Act of February 21, 1871<br /><br /><a href="http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=63062.0" target="_blank">http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=63062.0</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.apfn.net/DOC-100_bankruptcy.htm" target="_blank">http://www.apfn.net/DOC-100_bankruptcy.htm</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.barefootsworld.net/usfraud.html" target="_blank">http://www.barefootsworld.net/usfraud.html</a><br /><br />This one has the link to the Congressional record, could someone that&#039;s a half a lawyer answer, is it true?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.afn.org/~govern/bankruptcy.html" target="_blank">http://www.afn.org/~govern/bankruptcy.html</a><br /><br /><b>LFS:</b>Beleive me when I tell you, I have a strong faith in God and I am being guided right now to do things I don&#039;t understand, nor care too. Death is irrelevant. We will all do it. I have been on deaths door and it is not a bad place. I have no fear. I am an above average shot with good range and moderate survival skills. If it comes down to it, if that is where I need to be, I will. But my skill set is intelligence, crisis management and leadership. I have had an IQ in the 140+ range since I was first tested in Kindergarden. I have always led anything I have participated in, even though I may have been the youngest and weakest in the bunch. And in crises, that is when I am best, the world stops and everything is clear and in slow motion. I was born to lead and will ultimately take a leadership role in this if/when it all happens.<br /><br />I only miss one peice of the puzzle, rallying point. Tactically, I have not found it yet. Staying in your homes and waiting on them will not work. People must be ready to leave with all necessary supplies and possesions necessary to survive in less than 1/2 day&#039;s time. They must know their destination. They must be partially packed. They must have a mental and physical checklist of what goes and what stays. But ultimately, they must be mentally prepared for it to happen. I just don&#039;t know where to go. I was thinking the South Texas area, close to the border. Due to the chaos in place, it provides great cover. But water is necessary. Cover is necessary.<br /><br />Additionally, work needs to be done on the national guard. They are our saviors. The individuals must know which side to choose when they are asked to turn their guns on their own. They will have to be the ones to defend our locations, not so much the deer hunters and first time gun owners. You can&#039;t fight Abrahms tanks with .243 rifles and 20 gage shotguns. Red Dawn isn&#039;t realistic. One night raid with a A-130 gunship and the &quot;Wolverines&quot; are dog meat.<br /><br /><b>ME:</b>They are demonizing the American public. But in doing that, they are now exposing themselves and that is what is making a lightbulb go off in people&#039;s heads, the people just need to be fed the correct information in order to turn this thing around before it&#039;s too late.<br /><br /><b>LFS:</b>You seemed to be better informed and have hope that it can be stopped. That is reassuring. I have been operating under the assumption of this being inevetable. Everyone I know already beleives something is going down. Even with the knowledge, how does that make anything different. How does that stop it? Turning on the lights doesn&#039;t make the cockroaches go away, it just makes them scurry. You still have cockroaches.<br /><br />Basically, what gives you hope that we can stop this peacefully?<br /><br /><b>ME:</b> We need to because the alternative is unthinkable</div>

It is important to recognize the ongoing nature of this event and the fact that public health guidance may change as this event transpires and more becomes known about this new virus. Public health officials advise that good health habits like covering your cough and sneezes with a tissue, and washing your hands often can help stop the spread of germs and prevent respiratory illnesses like the flu.<br /><br />Persons who develop influenza-like illness, may be ill for a week or longer, and should stay home and avoid contact with other persons, except to seek medical care. Consult your health care provider for specific questions. In general you should avoid contact with other people as much as possible to keep from spreading your illness to co-workers, friends and family members. The best source of the most up-to-date information and guidance can be found at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/</a><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Guidance for NOAA Employees<br /><br />The dynamic nature of a pandemic influenza requires that the scope of Federal government Continuity of Operations (COOP) planning takes a non-traditional approach to continuity planning and readiness.&nbsp; Planning and preparing for a catastrophic event that is not geographically or temporally bounded calls for a creative and dynamic approach.&nbsp; The Office of National Security Coordination which is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Interagency Pandemic Influenza Working Group, developed guidance to assist the Federal Executive Branch departments and agencies in identifying those considerations which may have a substantial impact on the continuity of their organizations during a pandemic.&nbsp; NOAA used this guidance to develop a NOAA Pandemic Influenza Annex to the NOAA Continuity of Operations Plan.&nbsp; This Annex serves to provide key policy, advice and specific activities to prepare and respond to the different phases of a Pandemic.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Additional NOAA and Federal Links<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Workforce Management - Support for NOAA Employees<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * NOAA Safety and Occupational Health Homepage<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Occupational Safety and Health Administration - Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for an Influenza Pandemic<br /><br />Most experts agree that there is a growing and significant threat of a flu pandemic. Right now no one knows when the next pandemic will occur or how severe it may be. However, we do know that many of the things the Federal Government is doing to plan and prepare for a pandemic will help the Nation be prepared for all hazards. While the current 2009 H1N1 Flu outbreak has been mild, there is concern that this strain could have an even greater impact during the fall and winter months. In the past, similiar events have happened.<br />For further information on pandemic flu; <a href="http://www.pandemicflu.gov" target="_blank">www.pandemicflu.gov</a> and <a href="http://1918.pandemicflu.gov/" target="_blank">http://1918.pandemicflu.gov/</a><br /><br />Additional Questions :&nbsp; If you additional questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Employee.status@noaa.gov">Employee.status@noaa.gov</a>.

For more information about COOP activities and how they affect you, the employee, please click here for a quick overview.<br /><br />NOAA COOP<br /><br />NOAA Homeland Security Program Office (HSPO) serves as the lead COOP planning agent for NOAA. HSPO, in coordination with the NOAA COOP Working Group, has developed a NOAA Headquarters COOP Plan. The NOAA COOP Plan documents the overarching strategy, policies and procedures with a focus on COOP elements such as alternate site criteria, testing and exercise objectives, annual COOP validations and interagency COOP efforts. Because COOP plans are living documents, HSPO continues to refine and improve the NOAA COOP plan to reflect lessons learned through both training exercises and real world events.<br /><br />The Federal Continuity Directive 1 (FCD 1) provides direction to the Federal executive branch for developing continuity plans and programs. Continuity planning facilitates the performance of executive branch essential functions during all-hazards emergencies or other situations that may disrupt normal operations. The ultimate goal of continuity in the executive branch is the continuation of National Essential Functions (NEFs). Please click here to view the document in PDF format.<br /><br />What does this mean for NOAA personnel?<br /><br />The NOAA COOP Plan is an all hazards plan, ensuring the performance of essential functions during any emergency or situation that may disrupt normal operations. NOAA&#039;s COOP Plan ensures that in the event the headquarters building is closed for a period of time, NOAA�s COOP would be activated, ensuring the continuance of mission essential functions at an alternate operating facility or &quot;COOP site&quot;.<br /><br />NOAA&#039;s COOP emergency relocation group (ERG) have been identified and trained for a COOP event. During COOP activation, the ERG would report to the COOP alternate facility. All other NOAA personnel would receive instructions and, in most scenarios, non-ERG members will be directed to proceed to their homes or to other NOAA facilities to await further guidance.<br /><br />To help facilitate our ability to account for NOAA personnel&#039;s safety and status during periods of emergency (natural or otherwise), all employees should use either the NOAA Check-In System (<a href="http://www.homelandsecurity.noaa.gov" target="_blank">http://www.homelandsecurity.noaa.gov</a>) or the Toll-Free Call-In Number (1-888-NOAA-911 or 1-888-662-2911) to contact us as soon as possible to advise us of your status and provide a means of contacting you.<br /><br />COOP Testing, Training and Exercises<br /><br />NOAA conducts annual COOP exercises to;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Exercise alert and notification of ERG members;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Exercise deployment to alternate facilities during normal duty hours;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Establish an operational capability at an alternate facility;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Implement succession plans and delegations of authority;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Demonstrate an interoperable and secure communications capability;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Implement the process of receiving, processing, analyzing, and disseminating information from internal and external entities.<br />______________________________________________________<br /><a href="http://www.cio.noaa.gov/CIO_Org/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.cio.noaa.gov/CIO_Org/index.html</a><br /><br />Office of the Chief Information Officer &amp;<br />High Performance Computing and Communications<br />CIO Functions<br /><br />The NOAA Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is responsible to ensure NOAA&#039;s programs make full and appropriate use of information technology. The NOAA OCIO oversees the expenditure of approximately $600 million each year in information technology (IT) spending alone - computer hardware, software, services, networking, and telecommunications. This is accomplished by the development of centralized policies and guidance, which are implemented across NOAA. The OCIO works closely with business partners throughout NOAA and the Department of Commerce (DOC) to ensure the use of leading edge technology that will better enable the NOAA mission. The NOAA OCIO implements the following services and program elements:<br /><br />IT Policy and Legislation<br />The NOAA OCIO supports the following legislation with policies and guidance:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Clinger-Cohen Act - defining extensive standards for IT governance processes, IT Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), Enterprise Architecture (EA), and Program Management<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Government Performance and Results Act - integrating guidance for performance with CPIC and EA standards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * E-Government Act - consolidating across governmental functions into common, shared &quot;Line of Business&quot; models<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Federal Information Security and Management Act - setting standard processes for IT Security<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Privacy Act<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Information Quality Act<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Federal Records Act<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Rehabilitation Act - Section 508<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Telecommunications Act<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Paperwork Reduction Act<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; * Government Paperwork Elimination Act<br /><br />High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)<br />The NOAA OCIO manages and integrates NOAA&#039;s HPCC infrastructure, including advanced networking and applications, and serves as the project management office for NOAA&#039;s R&amp;D High Performance Computing Systems. It seeks to modernize NOAA&#039;s computationally intensive services through the use of evolving HPCC technologies. Short-term weather warnings, seasonal forecasts, and regional and global climate predictions are heavily dependent on major advances in high-end computing power, advanced information technology, and the widespread availability of environmental data and information.<br /><br />Homeland Security Program<br />IT services and information delivery at NOAA must be resilient in the face of catastrophic failures, or natural/man-made disasters. NOAA&#039;s Homeland Security Program (HSP) ensures NOAA&#039;s continuity of operations to support the nation&#039;s mission essential functions, and coordinates all homeland security and response-related plans and policies to provide an integrated effort across NOAA. Plan development, testing, training and exercises ensure NOAA is ready to deliver vital services when disaster strikes. HSP leads NOAA&#039;s Incident Coordination Center to ensure a coordinated NOAA response to incidents and that products to internal and external partners are available in time of urgent need. HSP develops procedures to promote the safety and security of NOAA&#039;s mission, people and facilities.<br /><br />Policy, Planning and Analysis Office<br />The Policy, Planning and Analysis Office manages the development and review of policies, plans, and procedures for management and use of IT resources, including all computing, telecommunications, and associated resources. The Office administers NOAA&#039;s multi-year strategic information resources planning process, including developing and administering NOAA&#039;s Strategic IT Plan and Operational Plan.�&nbsp; The Office manages the capital planning and investment control process within NOAA and coordinates the selection, control, and evaluation reviews of IT initiatives and other proposals, including support to the NOAA IT Review Board. It manages the agenda, minutes, and action items of the NOAA CIO Council. The office oversees and coordinates activities regarding the E-Government Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, Federal Information Quality Act, and the accessibility provisions of the Rehabilitation Act.�&nbsp; The office is responsible for the development of NOAA-wide contractual arrangements that support acquisition of widely used computer and networking hardware, software, and services.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IT Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The NOAA Capital Planning and Investment Control program ensures NOAA uses IT to develop the best value, most useful, and most effective products and services to support its mission. This program ensures IT plans align with NOAA and the Department strategic visions and mission requirements, and that executives have accurate and meaningful information for IT decision-making. This includes critical information on a proposed IT investment&#039;s overall value to the organization, the return on the investment, measures of performance, and effective risk management plans. The NOAA IT Review Board, managed by the OCIO, serves as NOAA&#039;s authority to select, control, and evaluate IT capital investments through review of budget and IT investment authority requests, system/control reviews, and post-implementation reviews.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Review of Information Collection Requests under the Paperwork Reduction Act<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 requires that agencies obtain Office of Management and Budget approval before requesting most types of information from the public. &quot;Information collections&quot; include forms, interviews, and recordkeeping requirements. NOAA primarily collects information in support of Fisheries and National Ocean Service programs. The NOAA OCIO is responsible for coordination and review of information collection requests from all line and staff offices, and for their submission to DOC and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in a timely manner. Submissions include renewals and rule-related revisions of existing collections, as well as requests for new collections. Our role is to assist each program in submitting the best possible request for OMB approval, in terms of utility, quality and integrity of information.<br /><br />Enterprise Architecture<br />Enterprise Architecture (EA) is both a process and a living document providing a blueprint to guide the development and acquisition of efficient and secure IT solutions to meet NOAA&#039;s mission and objectives. The NOAA EA augments the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System (PPBES) function to enable analysis of IT alternatives to close performance gaps, identification of redundant IT investments and establishment of technical standards and architectural principles to maximize sharing of data across programs and applications.<br /><br />IT Security Program<br />Information is central to NOAA&#039;s mission; any amount of data loss, network failures, or malicious intrusions can result in far-reaching damage. Attacks on NOAA&#039;s systems are continuous and, given the sophistication of attack tools, the threat is constantly increasing. The IT Security program ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of NOAA&#039;s information resources is protected. The NOAA Computer Incident Response Term (N-CIRT) coordinates incident responses and acts as a source of expertise and information regarding vulnerabilities and responses as it pertains to the NOAA environment.<br /><br />Program Management<br />Effective program management of IT investments provides NOAA with the timely delivery of new and existing services maximizing the value of taxpayer dollars. The OCIO establishes guidelines, processes and procedures for individual project managers and coordinates a program of continuous process improvement in project execution through the use of project tracking, periodic management reviews and detailed project audits. The NOAA OCIO manages a project portfolio Website as a repository for project artifacts to expedite review and approval of project documentation. In addition to providing Project Management guidance, the OCIO supplies direct program management for major projects which are deemed critical to NOAA&#039;s enterprise infrastructure.<br /><br />Messaging Operations Center<br />The Messaging Operations Center (MOC) provides the management of NOAA&#039;s email, calendaring, Blackberry enterprise server and their supporting directory infrastructure. The MOC also provides common and customized services related to this infrastructure, as well as the helpdesk for the email, directory, and LAN administrators in the fields who support related services throughout NOAA.<br /><br />Network Operations Center<br />The Network Operations Center (NOC) provides secure, high-speed access to NOAA Headquarters&#039; internal networks and the Internet and Internet2, as well as management of NOAA&#039;s DC Metropolitan Area Network. The NOC provides a single point of contact to resolve network-related issues and manages network assets, cable utilization, Domain Name Services and IP address use through configuration management. The NOC produces and manages real-time statistics to address performance-related issues across the network.<br /><br />Web Operations Center<br />The Web Operations Center (WOC) is a unified web service used by all organizational units in NOAA. The WOC acts as a data repository for NOAA where public information can be posted to a secure and scalable content server. Aside from content management and delivery, the WOC supports protocols and applications for time server synchronization, network news, data archiving, archived video streaming and collaboration services.<br /><br />Administrative and Financial Systems Support<br />NOAA&#039;s administrative computing center provides IT oversight, systems analysis, design, and programming support for NOAA&#039;s financial and administrative applications. The full life-cycle management of these systems ensures the delivery of efficient, effective, and accessible solutions in compliance with procedures, policies and DOC and NOAA the enterprise architectures. This support serves the NOAA financial and administrative community, as well as users in the Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and Economic Development Administration (EDA).<br /><br />Helpdesk and Systems Support<br />Local area network and related computer hardware and software support are provided by the OCIO for NOAA&#039;s corporate offices in the Washington DC area and corporate field offices in Boulder, Kansas City, Norfolk and Seattle. The OCIO provides life-cycle replacement and helpdesk support for servers, desktops, laptops, PDAs, switches, routers, cabling, printers, remote connection capabilities and telecommunications.<br /><br />IT Workforce Management and Development<br />Having a highly-skilled IT workforce is crucial to NOAA&#039;s ability to meet mission goals. As NOAA continues to streamline IT resources, resulting in more enterprise-wide programs, we must also ensure the IT workforce is well versed in such areas as IT project and risk management. The OCIO works in partnership with NOAA&#039;s Workforce Management Office to develop, implement and communicate strategies to recruit, retain and manage a fully trained and qualified IT workforce, to meet current and future mission requirements.</div>

Terrorism prevention and border security were identified as priorities for the National Level Exercise 2009 (NLE 09). During the National Exercise Program Training and Exercise Plan Workshop, January 8, 2008, a consensus was reached that the NLE 09 exercise cycle should begin with a <i>terrorist event outside of the United States </i>and focus on preventing subsequent efforts by the adversary to enter the United States and carry out additional attacks. This approach would enable participating senior officials to focus on issues related to protecting U.S. assets abroad, preventing associated events domestically, and protecting of U.S. critical infrastructure. NEP ESC members stated a desire to exercise borderland maritime security along the southern border.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />EXERCISE OVERVIEW<br /><br />The proposed exercise construct includes a common scenario that transitions through a series of building block exercises, beginning in the discussion-based Principal-Level Exercise (PLE) 3-09 and culminating in the operations-based NLE 09. This series of exercises will focus exclusively on the prevention and protection mission areas, rather than incident response and recovery. Because there is no specific incident site, NLE 09 offers an opportunity for a broader geographic scope than previous Top Officials Exercise Series (TOPOFF), with regional exercise conduct allowing more State participants, but each with a smaller commitment than previous TOPOFF partners. An overseas terrorism incident will initiate PLE 3-09 and then lead into exercise conduct focused on incident prevention and distribution of intelligence and threat information. The PLE will address senior-level reaction to the international incident and the subsequent indications that the adversary is preparing to infiltrate U.S. borders and attack within the United States. The NLE 09 scenario will focus on intelligence and information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement communities, and across all levels of government. NLE 09 exercise conduct will concentrate on preventing the adversary�s entry to the United States through border security, maritime security, and the sharing of information and intelligence between Federal, State, and local participants. This will prompt further senior-level decisions regarding the protection of various infrastructure sectors and the public alert / notification and security advisories. NLE 09 will allow terrorism prevention efforts to proceed to a logical end (successful or not), with no requirement for response or recovery activities.<br /><br /><br /><br />EXERCISE THEMES AND OBJECTIVES<br /><br />Federal participants at the National Concept and Objectives (C&amp;O) Meeting, August 19, 2008, agreed to the following objectives and general themes:<br /><i><br />- Intelligence / Information Sharing and Dissemination<br /><br />- Counter-Terror Investigation and Law Enforcement<br /><br />- Air, Border, and Maritime Security<br /><br />- Critical Infrastructure Protection, with sector specific focus on:<br /><br />o Banking and Finance<br /><br />o Energy (Electricity, Oil, and Gas)<br /><br />o Transportation<br /><br />o Communications<br /><br />o Information Technology<br /><br />- Public and Private Sector Alert / Notification and Security Advisories<br /><br />- International Coordination<br /><br />- Attribution and Response Options</i><br /><br />Refinements are being made based on input to the National and Regional Initial Planning Conferences (IPC) held in early December.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />EXERCISE DATE AND DURATION<br /><br />Exercise Date: July 27-31, 2009<br /><br />Exercise Duration: 5 days, with limited precursor intelligence injects<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />EXERCISE LOCATIONS AND PARTICIPATION<br /><br />Potential Exercise Locations: National Capital Region (Federal headquarters elements); FEMA Region VI; with potential participation from other states based on exercise objectives. International Participation: DHS Assistant Secretary for International Affairs approved the National Exercise Division�s (NED) preliminary recommendations for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">international participation, which includes Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom</span>. NED will coordinate with the Department of State and other interagency partners to finalize the list of international participants.<br /><br /><br />This information is considered <i>FOUO</i>.</div></div>
