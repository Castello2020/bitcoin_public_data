							<div class="post">Feel free to add or / modify this list as neccessary.<br /><i>Initial source: <a href="http://www.apfn.org/apfn/camps1.htm" target="_blank">http://www.apfn.org/apfn/camps1.htm</a></i><br /><br /><b>FEMA CONCENTRATION CAMPS: Locations and Executive Orders </b> <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />There over 800 prison camps in the United States, all fully operational and <br />ready to receive prisoners. They are all staffed and even surrounded by <br />full-time guards, but they are all empty. These camps are to be operated by <br />FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) should Martial Law need to be <br />implemented in the United States and all it would take is a presidential <br />signature on a proclamation and the attorney general&#039;s signature on a <br />warrant to which a list of names is attached. Ask yourself if you really <br />want to be on Ashcroft&#039;s list. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The Rex 84 Program was established on the reasoning that if a &quot;mass <br />exodus&quot; of illegal aliens crossed the Mexican/US border, they would be <br />quickly rounded up and detained in detention centers by FEMA. Rex 84 <br />allowed many military bases to be closed down and to be turned into <br />prisons. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Operation Cable Splicer and Garden Plot are the two sub programs which will <br />be implemented once the Rex 84 program is initiated for its proper purpose. <br />Garden Plot is the program to control the population. Cable Splicer is the <br />program for an orderly takeover of the state and local governments by the <br />federal government. FEMA is the executive arm of the coming police state <br />and thus will head up all operations. The Presidential Executive Orders <br />already listed on the Federal Register also are part of the legal framework <br />for this operation. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The camps all have railroad facilities as well as roads leading to and from <br />the detention facilities. Many also have an airport nearby. The majority of <br />the camps can house a population of 20,000 prisoners. Currently, the <br />largest of these facilities is just outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. The <br />Alaskan facility is a massive mental health facility and can hold <br />approximately 2 million people. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Now let&#039;s review the justification for any actions taken... <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Executive Orders associated with FEMA that would suspend the Constitution <br />and the Bill of Rights. These Executive Orders have been on record for <br />nearly 30 years and could be enacted by the stroke of a Presidential <br />pen:... <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control <br />of highways and seaports. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the government to seize and control the communication media. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, <br />fuels and minerals. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the government to seize all means of transportation, including <br />personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control over all <br />highways, seaports, and waterways. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 10999 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the government to take over all food resources and farms. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under <br />government supervision. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare <br />functions. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all <br />persons. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and <br />aircraft, including commercial aircraft. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate <br />communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be <br />abandoned, and establish new locations for populations. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public <br />storage facilities. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives <br />authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased <br />international tensions and economic or financial crisis. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out <br />in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial <br />and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and <br />correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and <br />agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen <br />year period. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to <br />establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of <br />energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. <br />financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides <br />that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress <br />cannot review the action for six months. The Federal Emergency Management <br />Agency has broad powers in every aspect of the nation. General Frank <br />Salzedo, chief of FEMA&#039;s Civil Security Division stated in a 1983 <br />conference that he saw FEMA&#039;s role as a &quot;new frontier in the protection of <br />individual and governmental leaders from assassination, and of civil and <br />military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as well as prevention <br />of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S. opinion, or a global <br />audience in times of crisis.&quot; FEMA&#039;s powers were consolidated by President <br />Carter to incorporate the... <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />National Security Act of 1947 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />allows for the strategic relocation of industries, services, government and <br />other essential economic activities, and to rationalize the requirements <br />for manpower, resources and production facilities. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />1950 Defense Production Act <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />gives the President sweeping powers over all aspects of the economy. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Act of August 29, 1916 <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />authorizes the Secretary of the Army, in time of war, to take possession of <br />any transportation system for transporting troops, material, or any other <br />purpose related to the emergency. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />International Emergency Economic Powers Act <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />enables the President to seize the property of a foreign country or <br />national. These powers were transferred to FEMA in a sweeping consolidation <br />in 1979. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Where are these camps? <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />ALABAMA <br />Opelika - Military compound either in or very near town. <br />Aliceville - WWII German POW camp - capacity 15,000 <br />Ft.

Also fitting <br />this category are &quot;Regional Airports&quot; and &quot;International Airports&quot; which <br />also fall under federal jurisdiction and have limited-access areas. Mental <br />hospitals, closed hospitals &amp; nursing homes, closed military bases, <br />wildlife refuges, state prisons, toxic waste dumps, hotels and other areas <br />all have varying degrees of potential for being a detention camp area. The <br />likelihood of a site being suspect increases with transportation access to <br />the site, including airports/airstrips, railheads, navigable waterways &amp; <br />ports, interstate and US highways. Some facilities are &quot;disguised&quot; as <br />industrial or commercial properties, camouflaged or even wholly contained <br />inside large buildings (Indianapolis) or factories. Many inner-city <br />buildings left vacant during the de-industrialization of America have been <br />quietly acquired and held, sometimes retrofitted for their new uses. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />CANADA <br />Our Canadian friends tell us that virtually all Canadian military bases, <br />especially those north of the 50th Parallel, are all set up with <br />concentration camps.

Nelson - Northernmost point on the BC Railway line. <br />Ft. McPherson - Very cold territory ~ NW Territories. Ft. Providence - <br />Located on Great Slave Lake. Halifax - Nova Scotia. Dept. of National <br />Defense reserve.... And others. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />OVERSEAS LOCATIONS <br />Guayanabo, Puerto Rico - Federal prison camp facility.

Total capacity unknown. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />*** <br /><a href="http://www.sianews.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1062" target="_blank">http://www.sianews.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1062</a><br /><br />[If you found this article of interest, please consider perusing the <br />FriendsOfLiberty/SiaNews archives <br /></div>

It is so outside of my life experience. The USA has never been invaded. We don&#039;t have bombs going off daily in our hood. A base comfort level is maintained with food stamps and other public assistance to the populace.<br />What if that is all cut off in an emergency? The sheeple will be told to go here and there and be taken care of. I wonder what will happen to those of us who choose not to....<br />The breakdown of civilized society is nightmarish. I need to conquer that nightmare and take action to prepare.... It is all about personal responsibility.</div>

(just add &quot;prison&quot; to &quot;camp atterbury&quot; in the search to see the complex).<br /><br />You could be put on a train in atterbury and end up at beech grove.&nbsp; Just a point of interest.</div>

Of course under the hidden excuses they would use. I think Tex Marres did an excellent job of explaining the history of these camps, to the present day things that could be going on now. I want to look into the U.S. World news Report in 1995 about the tunnels he talked about , that they still have , and see why these are here. The nwo probably does have underground complexes, and we can do something to investigate these. oh and Godzilla , could you&nbsp; explain more about how all will be considered a terrorist? I did not catch this information in the video. Thnks</div>

							<div class="post">Another possible place in Ohio could be the Ravenna Arsenal&nbsp; located on Route 5 in Newton Falls about 20 minutes from my place.&nbsp; This is a HUGE place and along the road sides you cant see into the place cus its wooded, but in some areas that you can see in you can see alot of Hummve&#039;s and sometimes some Tanks.

(for what reason im not sure, just what I&#039;ve heard)&nbsp; but for the two years I&#039;ve lived here (2005-2007) and have drove past you can see its being used.. At the one entrance you can sometimes see military personnel walking around, plus the choppers and aircraft that fly in and out.<br /><br />I think the one article says during 98-99 they started expanding the base.

							<div class="post">POSTED February 16, 2008 at 10:07:36<br />by William John Cox <br /><br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR:<br />William John Cox authored the Policy Manual of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Role of the Police in America for a National Advisory Commission during the Nixon administration. As a public interest, pro bono, attorney, he filed a class action lawsuit in 1979 petitioning the Supreme Court to order a National Policy Referendum; he investigated and successfully sued a group of radical right-wing organizations in 1981 that denied the Holocaust; and he arranged in 1991 for the publication of the suppressed Dead Sea Scrolls. His recent book, You&#039;re Not Stupid! Get the Truth: A Brief on the Bush Presidency is reviewed at <a href="http://www.yourenotstupid.com" target="_blank">www.yourenotstupid.com</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_william__080216_concentration_camps_.htm" target="_blank">http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_william__080216_concentration_camps_.htm</a><br /><br />If you type the phrase &quot;concentration camps&quot; into your Internet search engine, you will find page after page of references to martial law and the construction of concentration camps in the United States on behalf of the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).<br /><br />A close examination reveals that many of these references lack sufficient facts to support their conclusions; however, taken as a whole, there is an abundance of factual information showing an alarming trend in the deployment of federal and military forces to restrain and detain American citizens.<br /><br /><br />Among the Internet sites are those listing between 600 and 800 locations in the United States where the government is establishing &quot;concentration camps.&quot; Many of these are former or active military bases; however, several provide detailed information about their location and improvements, including maps, utube videos, and satellite photographs:<br /><br />A former Amtrak facility located in Beech Grove, Indiana, is featured in a widely-viewed video on utube. From the audio description and video images, it is easy to imagine that the site could be used as a detention facility; however, a telephone call to the desk officer of the Beech Grove Police Department reveals that much of the evidence, including helicopter landing facilities and radio towers, actually belong to the police department that is located adjacent to the now largely abandoned facility. The desk officer, who also happens to be a local city councilman, was unaware of any federal involvement at the location. &quot;It�s a straight facility,&quot; he said.<br /><br />There are a number of photographs depicting a site in northern Michigan with a double row of chainlink fencing topped with barb wire and elevated guard towers. The area is part of Camp Grayling, the largest installation of the Michigan National Guard, which deploys several military police commands and trains more than 100 law enforcement agencies from Northern Michigan. The photographs clearly show an outdoor detention facility, and recent comments by an undercover observer confirm that it is currently maintained. However, there is an e-mail on the Internet dated January 20, 1999 from a base Deputy Public Affairs Officer who said: &quot;The �camps� you are referring to are used by our Military Police for training. One of their war-time missions is to process and care for prisoners of war (POWs). The photos you saw are of that training site.&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps the most disturbing images show a Department of Homeland facility known as Swift Luck Green located in Central Wyoming. The five satellite photographs are labeled as having been taken on January 23 and March 24, 2006 by DigitalGlobe and are annotated as &quot;DHS Facility (SLG).&quot; Labels include: prisoner housing, restaurant for DHS personnel; 3-story dormitory for prisoners; guard towers; and prison cells. Various blogs further identify the location as a closed coal mine near Hanna, Wyoming in Carbon County.<br /><br />There is nothing comparable to the photographs visible on GoogleEarth at the listed coordinates, and desk officers at the local sheriff�s office and the police department are unaware of any local DHS or FEMA facilities. An e-mail to DigitalGlobe�s media relations contact about the photographs received this reply: &quot;they were in a report called �the hidden gulag,� a report on secret nk [North Korean] prison camps.&quot; The report and original photographs can be viewed at the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea�s website, <a href="http://www.hrnk.org" target="_blank">www.hrnk.org</a>.<br /><br /><b>This is what fear has wrought. First, our own government has done everything in its power to make us fearful so we will support its illegal and unconstitutional activities, and then in our fear, we have come to distrust everything our government says and does � for good reason. These facts are undisputed:</b><br /><br />Commencing in the late Sixties, following urban riots in Los Angeles, Detroit, Newark, Cleveland, Seattle, Cincinnati and Milwaukee, and in response to a recommendation of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the U.S. military initiated plans to assist local and state civil authorities during urban unrest. Collectively, the response was known as &quot;Operation Garden Plot,&quot; and each military branch established its own plans, which have evolved over the years.<br /><br />In 1984, a military &quot;Disturbance Plan&quot; defined its targets as &quot;disruptive elements, extremists or dissidents perpetrating civil disorder,&quot; which in turn is defined as &quot;riot, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful obstructions or assemblages, or other disorders prejudicial to public law and order.&quot; It concludes, &quot;spontaneous civil disturbances which involve large numbers of persons and/or which continue for a considerable period of time, may exceed the capacity of local civil law enforcement agencies to suppress. Although this type of activity can arise without warning as a result of sudden, unanticipated popular unrest...it may result from more prolonged dissidence.... This would most likely be the outgrowth of serious social, political or economic issues which divide segments of the American population. Such factionalism could manifest itself through repeated demonstrations, protest marches and other forms of legitimate opposition but which would have the potential for erupting into spontaneous violence with little or no warning.&quot;<br /><br />Dated November 1985, a United States Army field manual entitled, &quot;Civil Disturbances,&quot; says &quot;if there are more detainees than civil detention facilities can handle, civil authorities may ask the [military] control forces to set up and operate temporary facilities.... These temporary facilities are set up on the nearest military installation or on suitable property under federal control...supervised and controlled by MP officers and NCOs trained and experienced in Army correctional operations.&quot;<br /><br />At the same time as these plans and manuals were being developed and issued, President Reagan authorized a secret program for the imposition of martial law and massive detentions. First revealed by Oliver North during his congressional testimony, the plan was known as Readiness Exercise 1984, or REX 84. The program was originally intended to confront a &quot;mass exodus&quot; of illegal aliens across the Mexican-U.S. border, and to provide confinement facilities where they could be locked up by FEMA.<br /><br />Otherwise known as a continuity of government plan, REX 84 involved an actual civil readiness exercise in April 1984 by FEMA in association with 34 other federal agencies. In a combined exercise with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Night Train 84 involved multi-emergency scenarios at play inside and outside the U.S. Confronted with civil disturbances, major demonstrations and labor strikes that would affect continuity of government and/or resource mobilization, and to fight subversive activities, the military was authorized to arrest as many as 400,000 people and to move them to military facilities for confinement.<br /><br />In 1985, FEMA�s director was Louis Giuffrida, who in 1970 had called for the imposition of martial law in case of a national uprising by black militants. He envisioned &quot;assembly centers or relocation camps&quot; for at least 21 million &quot;American Negroes.&quot; Regarding martial law, he later wrote, &quot;No constitution, no statute or ordinance can authorize Marital Rule.... The significance of Martial Rule in civil disorders is that it shifts control from civilians and to the military completely and without the necessity of a declaration, proclamation or other form of public manifestation.... Martial Rule is limited only by the principle of necessary force.&quot;<br /><br />As reported by the Miami Herald on July 5, 1987, &quot;These camps are to be operated by FEMA should martial law need to be implemented in the United States and all it would take is a presidential signature on a proclamation and the attorney general�s signature on a warrant to which a list of names is attached.&quot;<br /><br />The Defense Department has developed a &quot;Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support&quot; against terrorism that pledges to &quot;transform US military forces to execute homeland defense missions in the...US homeland.&quot; The Pentagon is presently collecting files on antiwar protesters and is prepared to maximize &quot;threat awareness&quot; and to seize &quot;the initiative from those who would harm us.&quot; The Pentagon�s National Counterterrorism Center�s central repository now includes the names of 325,000 &quot;terrorist&quot; suspects.<br /><br /><br />In October 2003, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld approved a secret &quot;Information Operations Roadmap&quot; calling for &quot;full spectrum&quot; information operations, including a strategy for seizing the Internet and controlling the flow of information. It views the world wide web as a potential military adversary and speaks of &quot;fighting the net.&quot;<br /><br />The U.S. Army Internet website displays information about the Pentagon�s &quot;Civilian Inmate Labor Program,&quot; including &quot;policy and guidance for establishing civilian inmate labor programs and civilian prison camps on Army installations.&quot; The program underwent a &quot;rapid action revision&quot; on January 14, 2005 to provide a &quot;template for developing agreements&quot; between the Army and corrections facilities for the use of civilian inmate labor on Army installations.<br /><br /><br />In yet another exercise in September 2005, the Pentagon�s U.S. Northern Command conducted a top secret operation known as Granite Shadow that involved emergency military operations within the continental United States without civilian supervision or control. Under the plan, military special forces units operating under unique rules of engagement involving deadly force were deployed to enforce &quot;unity of command.&quot;<br /><br />The original mission of FEMA was to assure the survival of the United States government in the case of nuclear attack, with a secondary responsibility to coordinate the federal response to natural disasters. However, FEMA has come to operate as a secret government in waiting, with powers far beyond that of any other federal agency.<br /><br />Specific and detailed executive orders now empower FEMA to: take over all transportation, highways and seaports; seize and operate all communications media; take over all electric, gas and petroleum power, fuels and minerals; take over all airports and aircraft; take over all railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities; take over all farms and food resources; register all persons and force civilians into work brigades; take over all health, education and welfare functions; and establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in all U.S. financial institutions.<br /><br />Executive Order 11921 provides that, once a state of emergency has been declared by the president, the action cannot be reviewed by Congress for six months.<br /><br />The John W. Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 contains a provision entitled &quot;Use of the Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies.&quot; One effect of the provision is to expand the president�s limited power to deploy the military within the United States only &quot;to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy&quot; to include &quot;natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident.&quot;<br /><br />The Act authorized the president to assume local authority &quot;if domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of maintaining public order.&quot; The president now has the power, without any advance notice to Congress, to declare marital law in any city experiencing a civil disturbance or riot similar to any of those experienced in the past 40 years and to deploy the military, irrespective of the wishes or consent of local and state authorities.<br /><br />On May 9, 2007, President Bush signed a &quot;National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive&quot; defining the &quot;Catastrophic Emergency&quot; leading to &quot;Continuity of Government coordinated efforts by the Executive Branch to ensure that National Essential Functions continue to be performed.&quot; Such emergencies include &quot;any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions.&quot; Continuity of Operations includes the continuation of mission-essential functions &quot;during a wide range of emergencies, including localized acts of nature, accidents, and technological or attack-related emergencies.&quot;<br /><br />In its definition of &quot;Enduring Constitutional Government,&quot; the Presidential Directive envisions a &quot;cooperative effort among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government;&quot; however, it (the effort) is to be &quot;coordinated by the President, as a matter of comity with respect to the legislative and judicial branches...&quot; Comity is defined by Black�s Law Dictionary as, &quot;Courtesy; complaisance; respect; a willingness to grant a privilege, not as a matter of right, but out of deference and good will.&quot; In other words, the &quot;Enduring Constitutional Government&quot; will be run by the president and any &quot;cooperative&quot; role played by Congress and the judiciary will be at his pleasure.<br /><br />Even though Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution provides that, &quot;All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States..., &quot; President Bush has, pursuant to his own directives, given himself the unrestrained power to declare whatever he imagines to be an emergency. Once he does so, he alone controls the entire apparatus of government. He will become responsible for arranging for the &quot;orderly succession&quot; and the &quot;appropriate transition of leadership&quot; of the other two branches of government, and he will do all of this with the able assistance of his Vice President, who has the primary job of coordinating things.<br /><br />Conceivably, at his or her sole discretion, existing and future presidents have the power to use any provocation, including the election of a successor president hostile to his or her existing policies, to declare a state of emergency and to seize and operate the government as a dictatorship for an indefinite period of time.<br /><br />More realistically, an increase in street and campus protests against the Iraq War, similar to those of the Sixties, could easily lead to the imposition of martial law in the Unites States as an extension of the War on Terrorism. Or, as the current recession deepens into a depression with wide-spread unemployment, hunger and civil unrest, martial law could be imposed and military work camps established. Irrespective of how it plays out, every scenario involves mass preventative detentions, without trial, by the military and requires federal confinement facilities.<br /><br />Accepting the fact that the president has the power to detain as many American citizens as he chooses, is the government actually building facilities to concentrate them?<br /><br /><b>In January 2006, the Department of Homeland Security awarded a $385 million contract to former Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR), to provide detention centers in the United States to deal with &quot;an emergency influx of immigrants into the US, or to support the rapid deployment of new programs.&quot; Unexplained were these &quot;new programs&quot; and why they require a major expansion of detention centers.<br /><br />A clue to the definition of &quot;new programs&quot; can be found in President Bush�s claim that &quot;the territory of the United States is part of the battlefield&quot; against terrorism and that he has the power as Commander-in-chief to detain indefinitely any American citizen he designates as an enemy combatant. He signed the Military Commissions Act in October 2006 that suspends habeas corpus rights for everyone he deems to be an enemy combatant and allows him to confine them indefinitely without trial or access to counsel. Once detained under the Act, &quot;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any claim or cause for action whatsoever....&quot;<br /><br /><br />The KBR contract is open-ended and authorizes a payment of up to $385 million per deployment. It is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which envisions the development of at least four detention centers, each detaining up to 5,000 single males and females, families with children, and the sick and criminal. Established at &quot;unused military sites or [leased] temporary structures,&quot; each facility will be able to accommodate the sick and criminals for extended detentions and to arrange for the &quot;rendition&quot; of potential terrorists to sites outside the continental United States.</b><br /><br />Cops have an old saying that you�re not paranoid if someone really is following you. We cannot forget that our president has already seized extraordinary dictatorial powers and that he really is spending millions of dollars for the construction of detention facilities to support the &quot;rapid development&quot; of his &quot;new programs.&quot; Nor, can we ignore that, contrary to international law, the United States government is in fact detaining hundreds of &quot;unlawful combatants&quot; in prison facilities in Guantanamo Bay and at other secret locations around the world. Finally, we have to accept: that our government is abusing and torturing these detainees to obtain information that will be used against them should they ever come to trial; that they have no access to the federal courts to appeal their detentions; that they cannot consult with counsel without the presence of military monitors, who also read their legal mail; that they cannot review or challenge the &quot;classified&quot; evidence against them; and that they cannot confront or cross examine the witnesses against them.<br /><br /><br /><b>There�s another old saying, &quot;If you snooze, you lose.&quot; We have a very narrow window of opportunity between the time we recognize a deadly threat and when we do something about it. Given the highly-advanced technological age we live in and the ready availability of overwhelming military force, once our freedoms are lost, they will be gone forever, whether or not every single one of us is &quot;bearing arms.&quot;<br /><br />Two weeks ago, Congress took an important first step in restricting the president�s power by repealing a largely unrecognized section of the 2007 Defense Appropriations Act that, last year, effectively transferred command of the National Guards from state governors to the president. With the unanimous support of the National Governors Association, the National Sheriffs� Association and other law enforcement agencies, Congress restricted the power of the president to order the National Guard of any state to be used within that state or in any other state without the consent of the appropriate state governors.<br /><br />We must immediately stop the deployment of National Guard troops to fight the illegal war in Iraq and bring them all home where they belong. Remaining under the control of state governors and given time to rest and the resources to re-equip, a well-trained and properly deployed National Guard, acting in support of local law enforcement, will be able to maintain order in most, if not all, domestic disturbances, natural disasters and terrorists attacks. If we survived the assassinations and riots of the Sixties, and 9-11, without martial law, we should be able to get by today without military intervention or the president�s help. <br /><br />There is no time to lose! Congress must immediately hold hearings on the power of the president to declare martial law, to deploy the military within the United States, and to detain American citizens, without trial or benefit of habeas corpus. Congress must establish the constitutional limits of presidential power by statute, rather than to allow the president to do so by his own executive orders.<br /><br />The incursions on civil liberties in the United States in the past 25 years, and particularly since 9-11, are mind boggling. It matters not whether you are a Democrat or Republican, rich or poor, conservative or liberal, you have been deprived of substantial freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, unnecessarily, in the War on Terrorism. Fear the loss, perceive the danger, and do something about it!<br /><br />The calendar may say 2008, but, increasingly, we�re living in 1984. America may not have concentration camps yet, but we�re sure enough working on �em.</b><br /><br />---------------------------------<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;">Great article.

							<div class="post">WILLIAM JOHN COX<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For over 40 years, William Cox has vigorously pursued a career in law enforcement, public policy and the law. As a police officer, he was a leader in the movement to professionalize law enforcement, writing the �Policy Manual� of the Los Angeles Police Department and the introductory chapters of the Police Task Force Report of the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, which defined the role of the police in America. As an attorney, he worked for the U.S. Department of Justice to implement national standards and goals, prosecuted for the Los Angeles County District Attorney, and operated an investigative law practice primarily dedicated to the defense of young people. Professionally, he volunteered pro bono services in two landmark cases. In 1981, he represented a Jewish survivor of Auschwitz and investigated and successfully sued a group of radical right-wing organizations who deny the Holocaust. The case was later the subject of the Turner Network Television motion picture, Never Forget. He also represented an �undisclosed client� and arranged the publication of almost 1,800 photographs of ancient manuscripts, which had been hidden from the public for over 40 years. A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls was published in November 1991. He is currently a Senior Deputy Trial Counsel for the State Bar of California, where he prosecutes attorneys who commit crimes and serious misconduct. <br /><br /><span style="color: blue;">Alex ever have him on as a guest?</span></div>

							<div class="post">More posts just today about FEMA Camps. <br /><br />About the Author:<br /><a href="http://spktruth2power.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://spktruth2power.wordpress.com</a><br /><br />Barbara H. Peterson is retired from the California Department of Corrections, where she worked as a Correctional Officer at Folsom Prison. She was one of the first females to work at the facility in this classification. After retirement, she went to college online to obtain a Bachelor&#039;s degree in Business, and graduated with honors. The most valuable thing she received from her time with UOP was a realization that her life&#039;s passion is writing. Now her business degree sits in her desk drawer, and she counts herself in the category of Writer/Activist. Someday she will make money writing, but that is not why she does it. &quot;I do it because I must. A driving force compels me to reach out to others with what I learn about the condition we the people are in, and that is what I devote my time to. After all, time is the most precious thing we have, and the older I get the more I want to use it wisely.&quot; One day Barbara would like to visit the land of Israel, where a tree was planted in memory of her grandmother. Of Hebrew heritage, she believes that Israel is the promised land. Her philosophy is this: You are on this earth for a reason - to fight for the light. Your words are swords that penetrate the darkness with truth and light. You have a purpose.<br /><br /><b>A FEMA Camp Called Home</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_barbara__080216_a_fema_camp_called_h.htm" target="_blank">http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_barbara__080216_a_fema_camp_called_h.htm</a><br /><br />February 16, 2008 at 13:30:41<br /><br /><b>Why would sane people willingly go to one of the numerous FEMA camps that exist across the U.S.? Answer: Because they are starving, have lost their homes, have no employment prospects, and literally have nowhere else to go. </b> <br /><br />The emphasis in the news of late on the Police State that is coming our way outlines the brutality that the �authorities� are using and are about to use on we the people, who are not of the �elite� class. Rounding people up to take them to FEMA camps is one scenario, and one that I believe is not unreasonable. However, I would like to step out of the box for a minute and take a look at the situation from another perspective.<br />&nbsp; <br />Let�s look at New Orleans. One of the main disasters in New Orleans was the water. Another was the herding of people who had literally no place to go into detention facilities; excuse me, places of refuge. When they got there, these people were treated like rabble, then dispersed. People are still looking for dispersed family members that are who knows where. The poorer people literally gave up their freedom because they did not know what else to do. They had no homes, they were on the verge of drowning, starvation was looming, and the water was not fit to drink. Prime candidates for a FEMA camp; excuse me, place of refuge, experiment.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />Now, let�s expand this picture to the coming depression. It is not over-the-top to look a bit into the future by looking into the past. It is 1929, and people are jumping out of windows. It is now 2008, or thereabouts, and people who have lost everything and do not know how to survive are running to the FEMA camps; excuse me, places of refuge, for food, shelter, and security. <br /><br />&nbsp; <br />The �authorities� do not even have to deploy force to a population that goes where it is supposed to willingly. With so many of us, which is the best method of operation? Yup, getting them to go willingly. By creating a situation that leads them to the right conclusions, you have your ready and waiting FEMA camps; excuse me, places of refuge, filled to the gills. The only thing required to start the process is a big enough catastrophe. Is a financial meltdown big enough? Just ask the poor people in New Orleans who were left with nothing when the water poured through town. They�ll tell you.<br /><br /></div>

Federal government assumed custody of the persons and arranged their release.<br />OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES<br />There are many other locations not listed above that are worthy of consideration as a possible detention camp site, but due to space limitations and the time needed to verify, could not be included here. Virtually all military reservations, posts, bases, stations, &amp; depots can be considered highly suspect (because it is &quot;federal&quot; land). Also fitting this category are &quot;Regional Airports&quot; and &quot;International Airports&quot; which also fall under federal jurisdiction and have limited-access areas. Mental hospitals, closed hospitals &amp; nursing homes, closed military bases, wildlife refuges, state prisons, toxic waste dumps, hotels and other areas all have varying degrees of potential for being a detention camp area. The likelihood of a site being suspect increases with transportation access to the site, including airports/airstrips, railheads, navigable waterways &amp; ports, interstate and US highways. Some facilities are &quot;disguised&quot; as industrial or commercial properties, camouflaged or even wholly contained inside large buildings (Indianapolis) or factories. Many inner-city buildings left vacant during the de-industrialization of America have been quietly acquired and held, sometimes retrofitted for their new uses.<br />CANADA<br />Our Canadian friends tell us that virtually all Canadian military bases, especially those north of the 50th Parallel, are all set up with concentration camps. Not even half of these can be listed, but here are a few sites with the massive land space to handle any population:<br />Suffield CFB - just north of Medicine Hat, less than 60 miles from the USA.<br />Primrose Lake Air Range - 70 miles northeast of Edmonton.<br />Wainwright CFB - halfway between Medicine Hat and Primrose Lake.<br />Ft. Nelson - Northernmost point on the BC Railway line.<br />Ft. McPherson - Very cold territory ~ NW Territories. Ft. Providence - Located on Great Slave Lake. Halifax - Nova Scotia. Dept. of National Defense reserve.... And others.<br />OVERSEAS LOCATIONS<br />Guayanabo, Puerto Rico - Federal prison camp facility. Capacity unknown.<br />Guantanamo Bay, Cuba - US Marine Corps Base - Presently home to 30,000 Marines Cubans and 40,000 Albanians, and how many from Afghanistan and Iraq?. Total capacity unknown.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The following video is of a FEMA &#039;railway repair facility&#039; - the only problem is that the barbed wire fences are designed not to keep people out, they face inwards.&nbsp; While there is no use or need for the facility, the government has been spending millions of dollars converting this facility into an ideal concentration camp along with gassing equipment.&nbsp; Most people by now know that George W. Bush&#039;s grand father funded Hitler See Bushes.&nbsp; Most are not aware that the primary share holders of &#039;our&#039; Federal Reserve Bank, the Rothschild&#039;s, also funded both Stalin and Hitler.&nbsp; Their goals and methodologies have not changed.&nbsp; Fascists Socialist Nations terrified by &quot;unseen terrorists&quot; make ideal breeding grounds for massive financial profit.&nbsp; It is also worth looking into the FBI&#039;s programs to prepare children for living in this U.S.S.A. Police State.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P-hvPJPTi4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P-hvPJPTi4</a><br /><br />It doesn&#039;t exist. <img src="http://forumimages.prisonplanet.com/Smileys/default/rolleyes.gif" alt="Roll Eyes" border="0" /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><img src="http://www.libertyforlife.com/images/concentration_camps_congress_knowledge.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br />Oops, whats that?

Critics of the camps protest at the outsourcing saying it is wrong for a private firm to seek profit from managing refugees. <br /><br />-- The cost to the government and taxpayer amounts to $53 per aslyum-seeker per day. <br /><br />-- Plans are afoot to allow for an increase in capacity for up to a further 3,000 illegal immigrants. <br /><br />-- The Australian government has increased the penalty for escaping from a detention center to five years jail from two and increased the term for helping escapees or inciting violence to ten years. <br /><br /><span style="color: limegreen;"><b>Timeline of camp violence</b></span><br /><br />June 8, 2000 -- 500 break out of Woomera. <br /><br />June 9 -- 150 break out of Curtin. <br /><br />November 29 -- Ten hospitalized after hunger strike at Woomera. <br /><br />January 21, 2001 -- 180 riot at Port Hedland. <br /><br />January 30 -- 300 riot at Curtin. <br /><br />March 27 -- 14 escape from Villawood. <br /><br />March 30 -- 60 riot at Port Hedland. <br /><br />April 4 -- 200 riot at Curtin. <br /><br />May 8 -- 100 riot at Port Hedland. <br /><br />May 26 -- 170 police raid Port Hedland camp, arrest 22 detainees and seize a cache of homemade weapons. <br /><br />June 2 -- 200 riot at Curtin. <br /><br />July 19 -- 23 escape from Villawood. <br /><br />July 23 -- 23 escape from Villawood. <br /><br />July 26 -- South African man commits suicide at Villawood. <br /><br />August 26 -- 39 detainees in hunger strike at Curtin. Five sew their lips together in protest. <br /><br />August 13 -- Six-year-old Iranian boy removed from a center is placed in foster care after refusing to eat, drink or speak. <br /><br /></div>

							<div class="post">I saw eight Halliburton trucks come into the Pilot Truck Stop in DuBois PA last week. I wonder if that had anything to do with the camp building by KBR/Halliburton.<br /><br />The drivers and workers on those trucks were some criminal, filthy looking MFers. They looked like the kind of workers normally associated with carnivals.<br />They also were very rude, parked anywhere they wanted, blocking access lanes, and generally acting like they owned the place.<br /><br />All the plates were Alberta Canada registrations. The elite certainly know that no American would build camps, but these criminal foreigners sure will.<br /><br />By the way I&#039;ve noticed the company color of Halliburton is all red. It&#039;s well known that red induces strong emotions like anger and rage. I wonder if that is done by design or they just like red.</div>

It looks like there&#039;s plenty of room for expansion.<br /><br />In the lower picture I enlarged and lightened to show detail, the area where the AGA tanks are. You can clearly see the piping going into the train houses on the left and into the larger building on the right.<br /><br /><img src="http://qimds.com/beechcamp.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br /><img src="http://qimds.com/tanks.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />This area is perfect for a Katrina II to happen. Large minority population, lots of crime. If some big event happened here and certain people had to be rounded up for &quot;safety&quot;, the rest of the country wouldn&#039;t care. FEMA will be praised for having a facility in place ahead of time, showing they learned their lesson after Katrina. 1,000&#039;s of so-called undesirables will be gassed, and just like Katrina they will be forgotten.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking they will house prisoners in the larger buildings. Then when the time comes they will use some excuse as to why they&#039;re being moved to another facility. The people will gladly march out to the tightly sealed train buildings and into Amtrak cars. Once loaded nice and securely they&#039;ll be gassed. When they pull out, they&#039;ll be loaded with dead bodies, presumably off to be cremated.<br />All the other refugees/prisoners won&#039;t have a clue the ones that left were dead before they even got off the property.<br /><br />&nbsp;People are gonna be slaughtered within sight of other people&#039;s houses in the neighborhood, and no one will be the wiser... except us.<br /><br />We gotta stop this insane crap.<br /><br /></div>
