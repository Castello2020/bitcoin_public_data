The only idea I have as of yet is that it might have come about from bit shifting another file (which it would be based upon). Can anyone confirm if another file is needed to complete this?

There are too many interesting avenues to pursue here. The histogram of the image shows a specific color with an unusual spike to it. I've manipulated that as best I can to try and view any hidden data, but to no avail. Then there are the multiple IDAT chunks. But, I've put together a similar image by defining random color values at each pixel location, and I too wound up with several of these. So far, I've also found very little inside them. Even more interesting, is the way that color values are repeated in the image. It seems, that the frequency of reused colors could hold some clue. But, I have yet to fully understand that relationship, if one exists. Additionally, there is only a single column and a single row of pixels that do not possess a full value of 255 on their alpha channel. I've even interpreted the X, Y, A, R, G, and B values of every pixel in the image as ASCII, but wound up with nothing too legible. This is all very interesting stuff, but so far, it leads me nowhere. Any hint at all?

This one is driving me nuts, too. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but I cannot find any lines or columns with nonzero alpha channel. However, I might found something but I am not sure if I am on the right track:Looking at the Image you see n***e. This made me look at if this n***e is white or has some outstanding properties. Analysis showed that in the n***e two outstanding things can be found. One of them might give you something like a bracket on where the hidden information is stored. The other one may be the key to the hidden information itself. However, the upcoming analysis of that portion has not brought up anything interesting so far. I know that so far only three people managed to completely solve this challenge, but maybe someone is at least a step further than me and can at least give a hint if my approach is heading in the right direction.

Does it have something to do with LSB?

However, I might found something but I am not sure if I am on the right track:You're probably more on the right track than I was when I made my first post on this thread. I was using a poorly constructed file parser when I loaded the image. I later rewrote my analysis code using a different one, and found the same. Another user pointed me in the direction of Chi Square analysis and LSB manipulation. I've got nothing else to go on for this one, so it seems like the most likely possibility right now.

Any help from the 6 who have completed it as to some direction?

I was trying to resume this challenge I started quite a long time ago but I just noticed the picture has changed, if it follows the same method the best hint was already given, just look at the dots you found and don't complicate it too much, think simple, you've done it for other challenges in this site.
