This post is dedicated to TheWhiteKid and his multi, JustGotH4ck3dHere's a link to his legendary first lulzy thread and the thread that followed, leading to his ban. After said ban, he made his multi and tried to redeem himself by laughing at himself. Notice the time between his last post as TheWhiteKid and the register date of his multi. Classic. Many lulz were had at his expense. What you cannot see in the threads are his CRUISE CONTROL rage posts containing all the common swear words.TheWhiteKid, I salute you for being the lulziest member of HTS I have seen in my time here. (thedotmaster excluded =P)
