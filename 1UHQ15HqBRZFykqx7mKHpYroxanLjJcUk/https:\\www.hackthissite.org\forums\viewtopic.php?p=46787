'Submit' button in HTML Post a reply

by RabbitH0le on Wed Sep 29, 2010 5:14 pm	([msg=46786]see 'Submit' button in HTML[/msg])
Quick question. I'm tinkering around with HTML forms on my test website. I'm trying to make a virtual guest book that includes Name and E-mail inputs and has a Submit button to submit the data. I don't quite understand where this data goes after it is submitted, and how I am supposed to retrieve it. Can I get it to flow to a text file of some sort?Here is the code I have now:<form name="input" action="" method="get">Username: <input type="text" name="user" />E-mail: <input type="text" name="email" /><input type="submit" value="Submit" /></form>
live together or die alone.

You can't make a guestbook entirely in HTML. Like you said, there needs to be something to handle the input. This "something" is probably wither ASP or PHP. Perl, Python, and just about any other language can handle it, but ASP and PHP are the two most commonly associated with server-side web code.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

Thanks Goatboy. I thought there was something I was missing. Looks like I just added PHP to my TO DO list.

Remember, HTML is client side - it won't have any impact on your server.

You might want to check out MySQL as well for storing information in a database: php mysql guestbook

Yes Sanddy I know but Im done html tutorials well to a degree. Im sure they are useful but they did not cover how the data is saved to a form and how to display saved data on an html doc so there is no point in using it for now. Im hoping php covers that however.

Do some googling; I'm sure you'll find more than enough information.
