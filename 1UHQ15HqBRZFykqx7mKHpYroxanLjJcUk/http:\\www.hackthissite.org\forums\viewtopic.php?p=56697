Errm... I don't mean to necro, but I am really looking forward to this type of mission... Wondering if it will be up soon and/or if I can help in any way with it? I'll be working on stuff on data recovery over the summer so it'll be an awesome help Bloodfire	New User

http://goatserv.doesntexist.org/First post. Enjoy. Any comments about the blatant lack of effort in both the mission and my "blog" will be met with a good hard dicking. And by that I mean I will probably just grunt and move on to the next post.

Perhaps I'm just a hopeless newfag, but when I tried to open each link it couldn't connect to server? (On FF)

Going to lock this down for the time being until either the links are restored or we decide to remove it entirely.
