There is a runaway train headed for a junction. The default path of the train has five people on it and the alternative has one. You have the power to change the path of the train and kill one person instead of five. Will you?Note: If so, you are considered responsible for the death, but if not, are you responsible for the death of the five people?

Well either way people are going to die. And either way, I am responsible. I would rather have one die than 5. But since you are asking a question that looks so simple on the outside, I am assuming there is a follow-up question.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

@Goatboy : You murderer...Here is another version:A runway train is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by dropping a heavy weight in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you and your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five.

This sounds like a scene from Zombieland or something. I would say it would be the right thing to do, although I don't know if I could build up the courage to do it, I'm usually passive. And I guess it depends if you would get caught, are we factoring in politics here? And are we assuming these people are equal, or could the fat guy be like a charity organizer and the 5 guys thugs?

They were meant to get a feel for most people's morals. IIRC, the majority of people felt the lever scenario was okay but the fat guy scenario wasn't (because in the first one person is indirectly dying, whereas in the second you're directly killing someone to save people).As for your weird question, obviously we're not factoring in politics and you don't know the people.

I would tell the 5 ppl to get off the rail... that shud be possible.. but if not, I dont think I have the capability to push the fat guy himself(i'm skinny and not muscular), coz if I can do that, obviously, I could throw myself down and be able to stop the train itself..So, I just added another choice, ie, risk ur own life for another 6 ppl... Hmm, difficult.. I dont think I will ever have to make the choice tho

I'd walk away doing nothing at all because this situation exceeds my judgement capacity. Or I might just pull someone else in to make the judgement on my behalf. Either ways, I'd do nothing directly in response for the situation.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive mefor.

Let the 5 die...Death is quite unfortunate but you can't arrest it. Maybe even get injured and get some compensation(under the pretense of attempting a rescue)*Goddamn. I assume that first page posts are recent and neglect to look at post dates*

A broken clock is right twice a day, however, I am neither up that early nor up that late...
