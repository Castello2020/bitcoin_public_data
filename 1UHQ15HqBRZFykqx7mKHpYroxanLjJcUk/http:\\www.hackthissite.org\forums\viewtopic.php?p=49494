Before we can test it, you need to prove that it is in fact your website. Post an HTML comment on the page saying "HackThisSite" and then link us to that page.

pinguin123 wrote:Ok, I added a GET-Parameter for proofing That's still done on the client.Goatboy's asking for some proof that it's your site. It is, right? If so it shouldn't be too hard to provide proof of it. Doesn't even need to be HTS stuff. Put up a comment with your username maybe. It won't be viewable to the public; i'd be shocked if you were contacted in doing so by some concerned citizen. "I'm going to get into your sister.

The smart thing would have been to leave it up until someone came by to confirm it. Just add a comment saying "GBIAFB" and wait until we say it's okay. I figure a random string of characters won't cause much alarm if anyone does see it.

I think it means:"Goat Boy Is A Fucking Beast"Please excuse my French.
