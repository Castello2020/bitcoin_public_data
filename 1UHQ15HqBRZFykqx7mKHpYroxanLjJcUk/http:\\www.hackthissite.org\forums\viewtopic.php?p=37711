I read a article on the internet that says humans are made from earth, and demons are made from smokeless fire, and angels from light. It also said that humans and demons are the only two being created by god that have free will, and that angels do not have free will and are bound by the will of god. Using this knowledge(assuming its true) and other things I have learned I think that Satan is just a angel, and that god told him to make a place called hell so that people who don't follow his commandments go. Since he had to make hell which made smokeless fire he himself became a demon and therefore had free will. And when god told Satan and his demons and all of gods angels to bow down to the humans(Adam and Eve) the demons refused because they thought they were better than humans and therefore should not bow down to the humans. So god banished Satan and all his demons to hell. I might be wrong here but if we become angels in heaven then we don't have any free will anymore. And if we stay human and go to hell then we have free will. So I think I would rather have free will than to be an angel and not have free will. So that led me to think what if god made the earth and everything else just to make angels to do his bidding. these are just my thoughts on the subject they may be wrong.

Honestly, why bother believing all that bullshit if you've decided you want to go to hell anyway?

After I die, I'll probably be buried, and worms eat me, and it'll all be poop. That's what happened to my forefathers I believe. Oh, uh do worms poop? Run.

There is a good movie on this topic, it's called the Prophecy... it has Christopher Walken in it as the Angel Gabriel.. and at the end.. Viggo Mortensen (Aragon from LOTR) makes one oh his earliest acting debuts as the Angel Lucifer (aka Satan). Might be an interesting watch if your into that kind of thing... I could care either way, I just like Christopher Walken movies.
