That's right! Euforia33 has designed a new stego mission that is next in line to become an official HTS Mission. We would like to give you all the opportunity to participate in the beta testing. Currently there are two versions of the challenge; a standard stego image, and an automated (timed) stego image.How to access:http://games.tech33.co.ukUsername: betademoPassword: betademoAfter logging in:Programming Challenges - 1 : Automated VersionStegano Challenges - 1 : Standard VersionGood luck! Please contact any member of the HTS Staff or Euforia33 himself with any questions/comments/concerns.

What no comments or questions? Common guys we're looking for some feedback here ^^Euforia33 went above and beyond the requirements for this stego and ended up creating a whole little site to make the missions system similar to our own. Show some love.(protip: the data in the picture is encrypted, you will need to crack that too)

It has just been brought to my attention that a couple of you may have experienced a few problems after the login, I have now resolved this so there shouldn't be any further issues. If you do come across any, please let me know.@mock13 - If you meant you're new to steganography, you might want to read up a little on it first. You should no doubt come across http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography, this is a good source of information on this subject. Once you understand it better, try a few of the easier stego challenges first. This challenge was not designed to be easy, the proof of which lies in the fact that it's been over a month and it is yet to be solved.If the challenge was live, no two users would have the same information. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.-- Sun Jan 20, 2013 1:47 pm --Just to let you all know, the challenge images have been reverted back to the original design. For anyone who may have managed to find something in the previous image(s), do not worry. You will NOT have to do it all again as the changes to the image will have no affect on the data that they hide, any data you do have (as long as it's correct) will still be valid.Out of curiosity, has anyone managed to get anything from either of the challenge images?

My host is migrating to a new server so the test site will be offline for a while. I'll update this post when they finish.-- Fri Feb 08, 2013 1:36 am --Website is back up, good luck all.

I may be doing something wrong. I spent hours trying to figure this out.

I passed it to a certain level but I've encountered a weird c*******xt from the datamatrix which stumbles me over. Could you look at the PM I sent you and verify I'm in the right direction?

@Euforia33: I'll try your challenge later. I was much more interested in seeing if I could force a .PNG file footer in your sig by editing the hex of my user-agent. Alas I was unsuccessful. You'll see a few messages from me in your logs though, lol.
