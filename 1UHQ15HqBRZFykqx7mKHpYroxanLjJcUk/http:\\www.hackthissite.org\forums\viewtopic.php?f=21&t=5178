I made an attempt to write my own Javascript Challenge... It's really more of an encryption challenege written in Javascript... In fact all the code used in it is from various freescript sites that I just sort of compiled and put together. Anyway, I didn't intend for this to be a brain basher so if you do it super fast... don't hate on me. http://mvel.org/TreMission1/Here ya go... plus this gave me a reason to actually put something on that domain...

I looked at this challenge, and it looks great and for me at least some what challenging I haven't looked at it very much but at first glance to read through all that javascript in the prompt is going to take a while. Damn good mission or whatever it is intended to be GarGleM0nster	New User

I just wanted to try my hand at writing a mission, thanks for taking a look. Let me know how it works out for you. My theory behind the mission was to.1. Build a mission using commonly available (cut and paste) javascript code. 2. Combine a few methods of security from the absurd 'no right click' to the rather clever encryption method from http://www.javascriptkit.com/epassword/index.htmWell that's it really, just have too much time on my hands I guess?

One thing to note is that the "no right-click" method is pretty weak. Really all you need to do is copy the URL of the pop-up, paste it in a new tab, and view source from the menu bar. That opens up the source. That's where I get stuck. I've read through the functions a few times and the math seems fairly solid. I only looked at it for a few minutes (before literally falling asleep at my desk; yay finals week) but it was pretty well-written for a free short script.ADD: And to get around the ctrl blocking, I think you might be able to remap a completely useless key (caps lock, anyone?) to have ctrl functionality. Copy+paste now available.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

As for the no right click i just pulled up firefox and fired up firebug to easily look at it, that part is more of a retard test. And I like when the retards and little script kiddies get thinned out. GarGleM0nster	New User

wheee.. exactly what I had intended.... The way I get around it is to view the source of the page that initializes the popup, locate the popup url and just paste that into the address bar which gives me the standard toolbars to work with. If I had been smarter I would have added a script to block direct access and force it into a popup.. woulda-coulda.
