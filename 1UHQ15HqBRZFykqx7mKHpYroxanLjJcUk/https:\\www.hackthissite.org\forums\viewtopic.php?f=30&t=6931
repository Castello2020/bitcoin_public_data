Oh, that's simple. All you need to do is dedicate many years of your life to studying security.

My favorite party trick is to jump on my roommate's (or my wife's, as the case is now) computer while they're gone and setup a remote desktop server. Then, I'll randomly take my laptop to an area where they aren't able to see the screen, connect to their PC, and move their mouse around. Granted, this takes physical access to their PC, but oh how much fun it is when they start yelling at you that there is a ghost in their computer moving the mouse around.

Granted, he set a password unfortunately he used his own name. Quite fun to move the mouse, add porn to his browser history etc. but damn tightvnc changes colour in the taskbar when someone is connected, giving me away I can't come to bed...Someone is WRONG on the internethttp://xkcd.com/386/
