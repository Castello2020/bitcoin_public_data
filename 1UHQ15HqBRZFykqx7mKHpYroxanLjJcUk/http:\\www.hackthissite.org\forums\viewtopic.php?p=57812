Yahoo stopped the geocities service . Just found out after reading your post. Well there are a lot of sites on tripod and wetpaint worth a laugh. And trust me they are not troll sites . The owners pretty much think they know what they are saying and insist that they are correct. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive mefor.
