by Nostalgiia on Tue Nov 16, 2010 5:56 pm	([msg=48979]see Brute Forcer In Python???[/msg])
i have in my possession, python code for a brute forcer, and after making a few corrections, it runs fine: but it only runs in idle. How would i go about executing said code to get in somewhere? Am i required to find an unicode or php exploit or something of the sort that would allow me to execute a file? I am puzzled as to how to execute this beautiful program btw code is :Code: Select allentry_len = 0choices = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789_$&#@ "entryArray = [ choices[0] ]choices_index = -1stop = Falsewhile stop == False: entry = "" for m in range( len(entryArray) ): entry += entryArray[m] print(entry) choices_index += 1 if choices_index == len(choices): choices_index = 0 array_index = 0 while array_index != None: if entryArray[array_index] == choices[-1]: entryArray[array_index] = choices[0] try: a = entryArray[array_index + 1] del a array_index += 1 except: entryArray.append( choices[0] ) array_index = None else: entryArray[array_index] = choices[ choices.index( entryArray[array_index] ) + 1 ] array_index = NoneRipped this baby off of Hell bound hackers forum and then fixed it.

Also, basically the definition of "Script Kiddie."Figure it out yourself.actually bro, i do know how it works, just not the implementation of the script, i couldn't have fixed it if i didn't know how it worked now, could i? but i really appreciate the constructive criticism prick. i'll tell you what, you go look at the code. it was all kinds of jacked up and then come back and tell me i have no idea how python works. I can code the shit, just don't know how to implement it effectively.

Sorry, I meant "you found something that you know how it works, you just don't know why the hell you wanted it in the first place. Sounds like a solid plan."Yet again, figure out what it does and what use it is to you. It won't magically hack into a site, Prick #2.

wow, your a complete moron. what is the title of this thread??? oh yea, BRUTE FORCER hmm... what does that do? idk, maybe i should learn what the fuck it does then i can figure out how to fix it and make it run properly. so, i'm assuming by your negative comments, that you have no clue how to implement it, you just have nothing better to do than to read threads that you have no clue about and then comment on them. just saying. once again its your turn, original prick...

For the love of god, will both of you calm down? @OP: Not sure what you mean...it's a python script, so run it on any machine that has python installed.By the way, I'm more inclined to side with Faz on this one, because if this guy doesn't even know how to run a program, chances are he didn't do much "fixing up".

@OP What you have there is 30+ lines of code that you could have written in 4 or 5 lines.Try this and let me know how long it lakes to output "I win".Code: Select allimport sysimport itertoolschoices = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789_$&#@ "for length in range(0,20): for entry in itertools.product(choices,repeat = length): password = ''.join(entry) print password if password == 'PassWord_5&': print 'I win' sys.exit(0)
Never stop learning.

Chya, right....I know what a brute-forcer is. I know how you use it. Obviously you don't and I didn't feel like telling you the answer because it let's you learn nothing.
