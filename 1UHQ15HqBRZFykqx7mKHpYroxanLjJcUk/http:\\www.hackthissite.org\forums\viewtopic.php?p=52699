I have spent hours on searching the web about port knowledge. I bought a second computer and for education reasons i wanted to see how i can access my other computer through an open port. I have ran a port scan and i saw that the port 80 is open in my other computer. Is there any link ( serious ) that you could suggest me to read so i obtain the basic knowledge or you can give me some tips ?Thanks in regards.

You need to find an exploit in an application or the operating itself. And port 80 is your default port for HTTP. Its open on most computers. If you don't know how to exploit something look up metasploit. Sorry for the crappy response, I'm on my iPod.
For those about to rock.

The only thing I would detract from mShred's post is that port 80 is not open by default on "most computers". It is open on most Web servers (I say most because they can change the port number) and it may be open for other reasons on a small number of computer.Also, I agree with dellex in that Virtual Machines are a good technology for this kind of experimentation. As long as your hardware can handle it, I'd suggest trying out VirtualBox.

Virtual machines are great because instead of buying more hardware each time you need another computer, you can just simulate the hardware in a VM. This saves time, money, and space. This is great for building a small test network.

I actually was in need of one so too late now but thanks for the info. Refering to the port accessing now is there anything you can suggest to start studying ?

mShred pretty much explained it. One does not simply walk into Mordor get into a computer through an open port. That computer needs to have a vulnerable service listening on that port, which you then need to exploit.
