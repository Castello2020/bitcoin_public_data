There is going to be a live lecture held this Friday at 8pm as an Intro to Linux. I'm sure you'll be have most of your questions answered there.

the only real way to get familiar with linux/bsd/whatever is to get it and use it. you can install nearly any linux distro in a vm pretty easily..

I will (hopefully) be handling the part of the lecture that deals with transitioning from Windows to a Linux distro.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

randyjones717 wrote:"Bash is similar to DOS or CMDYes and no. DOS is actually an operating system named, shockingly, Disk Operating System, so scratch that one. The command line in modern Windows systems (CMD) is similar to the old command.com in DOS-based installations. Bash, Bourne Again Shell, is one of the Linux command line shells and is far more powerful than the Windows command line.randyjones717 wrote:Emacs and Vi are like NotepadBasically. randyjones717 wrote:Shell scripting is like making a .Bat filePretty much, yes. Though bash scripts can be more robust than batch files, and more difficult to write in my opinion.randyjones717 wrote:.EXE files in Linux have no extentionI want to say that by convention, the answer is yes. You can make just about any file in Linux an executable one, though. You'll get a better answer at the lecture.randyjones717 wrote:ifconfig is like ipconfigYep.Check out the lecture... You'll learn a lot that will make your Linux experience a little more enjoyable.
