So what benefits does Blackbuntu have over BackTrack? Why should we use your distro?

Personally i think Gnome has a nicer feel to it than KDE. it also IMHO is a lot more organized of a system. but all that is configurable. it also comes with all the software to run it as your main system.Not to mention the Software support provided through ubuntu. and the thousands of packages out there with apt-get. that was a major point for me to, "why not use backtrack" until i realized that package support and software updates were huge if i wanted to run it as a main system. i think i read but i may be wrong that backtrack is based off debian or ubuntu, so it may use the apt-get for packages, but im not sure. either way software updates are a biggy.It also has a huge community behind it. not just the Blackbuntu community, but the ubuntu community since its so closely related to it, keeping a very familiar ubuntu feel to it.like all new systems it has bugs so we encourage you to try it out and let us know any problems you find. theres a spot on the forums for this. we will soon by trying to extend our reach to a 64 bit version as well.Kolton Kuhns

The software problem would essentially be fixed by adding the Ubuntu Repositories to your system, then you could "apt-get" anything you like, and receive Ubuntu's updates for it. People who don't know this, probably shouldn't be using a system designed for pen-testing.I'm always sceptical about new distributions. In my opinion there's tons too many out there as it is. Are you using a different kernel than Ubuntu? If so, how and why is it different? I don't mean to put you down, but if the distro is just Ubuntu with a bunch of Info-Sec tools installed, it doesn't seem like a good candidate for yet another derivative.

Sorry i have not gotten back to you, i forgot about this post as i have been busy with robotics.Im not to sure how the kernel is different. I do Documentation im not a developer. i do know we have more support for certain wireless cards.the main difference between us and backtrack is the fact that we use gnome and are more aimed at everyday use as a OS as well.EDIT: forgot to add, we are developing a 64 bit version which should be available in the next release.Thanks,Kolton Kuhns

Why I'm skeptical about this.1- A penetration OS should not be a day-to-day operating system. You shouldn't use it for word processing, facebooking, or tweeting.2- Backtrack is an Ubuntu derivative. It can already get new packages if you want it to.3- A 64 bit penetration os? I know that 64 bit cpus are very common now, but that doesn't mean that ALL systems are 64 bit. What if your target is on a 32 bit system and you boot up the live disk and ... Oops! It doesn't work because you're too clever.4- Your os is based on Ubuntu... 10.10? That is the new system, but it doesn't have as much support as 10.04. If you wanted to extend usability in the day to day life you should have gone with 10.04 LTSAnd on another note (not a really a point) but if your the documenter, shouldn't you know what the differences are? These are things that should be included in documentation.I'm sorry if I'm sounding condescending, but I believe it's important that these points be brought up.

personally i like it better then backtrack because of the gnome feel its great for beginners to learn linux as they go onto there hacking and pentesting stuff from windows and i personally hate setting up backtrack simply because its from scratch ubuntu is ready outta the box and automatically sets up a user account during installation thumbs up with blackbuntu and youll probably be hearing from me in the community or forums on the site as well lol good job with it though i thought i was gonna have to eventually make my own..

Backtrack from scratch? Where did you hear that? Backtrack is readily available for use. Of course you have to configure it according to your needs, which can take a few hours, but that's also the case with most of linuxes.You don't have to make anything from scratch.
