Websites? If you want to hack websites I recommend you learn HTML, Javascript, PhP, SQL and XSS (You can search google for tutorials on theses).If you want to hack into personal computer systems, I recommend you learn terminal commands for your operating system. Of course you don't need a terminal to hack into a computer, you can always write something like a trojan. If you want to create malware to access someone's computer, you need to learn how to program.

I'd love to tgoe, but HTS has gotten soft. We have to educate people instead of banning them. I miss the old days.

I think you'll find that it's often best to focus on one area at a time; there's no reason you can't study a variety, but if you try to learn everything at once you may get overwhelmed. If you pick one, study it until you achieve some level of mastery, and then move on to the next, you'll probably learn more in the long run. There's just an awful lot to learn under the broad heading of "hacking".
