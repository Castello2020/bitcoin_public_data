Other than proxy ans DNS servers. Are there any other tricks you guys have found for surfing the net anonymously? I do understand that the net has to send some address out that will track back to otherwise you would never be able to retrieve anything. But is there a service that you can go through that will third or fourth party your traffic. This might cause a bit of a lag, and you definatly wouldn't be streaming any video. Let me put it this way for better explanation .. I send from IP 1.11.123.0 to a service that continues my traffic as if it is originating the signal as 1.13.123.2 the site I am surfing sends back to 1.13.123.2 which then changes the destination IP back to 1.11.123.0 with out keeping a log of the IP change. Thus iany investigation of traffic ends at 1.13.123.2You would basically have to use the proxy as a physical buffer that you then surfed... I guess.Believe it or not I am in military comms and they do not train this stuff like the movies make it out we do. We are left to learn the movie tricks (which dont alawys really exist) by the same ways you guys do. Trial and error, and asking around.

I use stuff like IP Faker to browse anonymously. It makes me capable of changing my IP and makes it look like it's coming from a different country, sate and/or city.
