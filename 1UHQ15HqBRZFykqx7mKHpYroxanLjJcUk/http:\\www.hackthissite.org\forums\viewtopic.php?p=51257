by MVP027 on Tue Dec 28, 2010 12:11 am	([msg=51228]see Call Tracking[/msg])
Hello all, I am fairly new to this site, but I have been enjoying my time here. More on topic I have had someone calling my cell phone (iphone 3gs) for the last couple of days and the number has been blocked. Now I have tried to look up ways of tracking these said calls but have not found anything sufficient. Can anyone recommend some way of unmasking these calls?P.SSorry if I am using the forum wrong, this is my first time on the sites forum.

It won't be easy, and it might not work anymore, but there was a DefCon talk a while ago about using Asterisk and I think Google Voice or something to find out. It's complicated as hell, but you can look under Google Video for "defcon" and it's one of many. Sorry, can't remember which one it was.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

If they were just calling as "Private caller" IE using *67 or it's equivalent, all you have to do is log into your account and view your call history. I use an AT&T Gophone, so I would log in at www.paygomobile.com and then view my recent call history. Match up the times, and his actual number should be in the records.

So far, and I haven't worked on this too much because of work related issues.... I have found nothing on the Defcon method, but I am now moving on to the second suggested method. I'm sorry I can't produce more promising results, but work had been rough lately. If I find anything interesting I will be sure to share.

I think there is an app that will forward Blocked numbers to a 1(800) number and then shoot it back so you get the real number. Not sure if there is one for iPhone but my friend had it for his other cell.
The glass is neither half-full nor half-empty; it's merely twice as big as it needs to be. fashizzlepop	Developer

The easiest way is log in to your account and browse through your call history. Make sure to write down the exact time so you can check it along with the time stamps.
