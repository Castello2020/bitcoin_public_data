I remember brining up this idea before. Youtube is gonna support live streaming soon and Its in Beta testing right now. yes I know we only deal with audio but this could help generate a wider user audience to HTS and gather a bigger crowd for the lectures. Of course someone will have the burden of recording but what do you guys think?

We could use a vent recording and just stream it to youtube with a "HTS Lecture 3: Cool topic description here" picture for video. Hopefully not green letter on black background xD

We're looking into it. I had the idea for HTS Radio a while back, but that was dropped in favor of Lectures. I'd still like to see it happen though. I think a radio program would be great; we could stream Creative Commons/Public Domain music, then schedule talks and stuff throughout.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

@fashizzle you know you love my green on black. http://http://mrmasterful.ulmb.com/@goatboy. HTS radio you say? How would it work though? The streaming on youtube thing would mainly be to gather a bigger audiance. Can'e teach them if their not there right?

We can listen to music, interview the staff, roll out updates or news about technology and all that fun stuff. It needs a lot of dedication, though. Also also, we should think of ways to practice our newfound knowledge(after lectures). A game or test, maybe. Simple ones. Just to get the feel of it.

It would be really sweet if we could release a challenge for hts after each lecture that pertained to the topic...For example with that calculus lecture (even though it wasn't official) maybe toss up a calculusproblem and we need to solve for something. Maybe worth 2-5 points each and all thrown under a Lecture category in the challenges.

Yes! Now we just need the right marketing strategy to pull in an audience and we're golden baby!I got nothing at the moment though. Any ideas anyone? I still say youtube works wonders for online rants/lectures
