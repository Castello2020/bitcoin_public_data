Maybe put a sub-menu on the main page on the right, like the articles, to ensure that the most people will be informed about the lectures? It'll be great to have lectures on. Never actually attended one in my 2 years here.

Start submitting ideas here and now.3rd. I think that the bot should archive the logs and post to HTS under the lecture section for Previous Lectures.4th. +1 Sandy's ideas.I would also like to see advanced SQL Injection, Tor/Privacy, Perl Vs.Python (Un-prejudiced or maybe have two lecturers debate???), general good programming practice tips.There's a start.

Does the topics have to be about hacking and security, or anything can come up connected to computer science?

Well, okay... here are my suggestions:- Applied artifical intelligence (programming artificial neural networks, and virtual agent systems)- OpenCL (GPGPU programming)- Programming with functional languages (like haskell)- Programming microcontrollers (especially AVR)I know these are not hacking related, but I think there are many who will recommend those in my stead. Of course I'm interested in network security too.
