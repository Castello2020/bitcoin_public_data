There is no right and wrong only what we are told whether it be from religion ,parents, other authority figures media, friends and other influences. A example is in some cultures it is wrong to eat types of food others say differently. For instance some people believe that everything a hackers does is wrong because what they hear from the media but to a hacker some things they do is right to them because it is there way of making information free, right and wrong is just a state of mind.

What you are referring to, Orpheus, is the idea of Moral Relativism. The idea of moral relativity is gained in one of the later stages of moral development. That being said, the idea itself is not unique or groundbreaking - it's actually quite obvious, which is why this thread makes me meh a little bit. Instead of just stating the ideas of moral relativity, why not have an interesting discussion on it?I'd also probably be a bit more open to this thread if your entire post was not an explosion of grammatical failure.

That's not to say we don't have a natural, biological leaning to certain viewpoints - for example, we biologically feel compelled to take revenge when wronged, remove threats with no hesitation, etc. One example of this is reproduction - while we are biologically compelled to reproduce as much as possible, we are socially compelled to refrain from sex until your priest is hornymarriage.

So, if there is no such thing as 'moral', right or wrong. Just preprogrammed social imperatives. There is no reason why the more talented among us shouldn't hack into Money Bags Are Us Bank and take all their money!But then you come against that little inconvenience call the law! But if, like me, you believe that the law has been written by the owners of Money Bags Are Us Bank and their ilk in order to protect their interests, why would you bother worrying about the law?But where would that lead us? Sh!t creek, No paddle?

I wouldn't be surprised if morals evolved as a survival mechanism. Humans are social creatures and depend on each other for survival. If we did anything to hurt the chances of survival of the community (murder) or incur the anger of the community (stealing), then it would hurt our own chances of survival, either by hindering the survival of the community (which we depend on) or by the community shunning the individual (and the individual will lose a 'tool' of survival). Laws came about to as 'codified morals' that protect the community at the loss of the individual's freedom. People tend to obey the law because they think it benefits them more to obey the law than not to. With that said, if you think breaking the law is more beneficial to you, then there's nothing stopping you. The law only has as much power over the choices you make as you let it. The law may provide consequences for you choice, but it doesn't stop you from making that choice.
