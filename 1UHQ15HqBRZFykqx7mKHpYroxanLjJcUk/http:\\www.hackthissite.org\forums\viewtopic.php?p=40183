Got questions about HackThisSite? What about hacking? Want to introduce yourself? Want to tell a cool story? Need to ask for permission to take Goatboy's farm animals for a date? Do you want a person who will order you a medium pizza with any toppings for FREE? Yes, FREE!... Ok, probably not. But Goatboy, our very own moderator, is the man for you! Goatboy has been with HackThisSite for awhile, but wants to focus in NZone. He's definitely excited to assist you!
