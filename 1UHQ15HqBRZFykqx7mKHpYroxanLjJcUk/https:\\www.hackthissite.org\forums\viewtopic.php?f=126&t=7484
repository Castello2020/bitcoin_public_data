I have never approved of anything more in my life. Win.And it's funny you should have clips from a Scottish hammer toss, because I myself am a Scott, and I've been to several of these. Never competed, but I've thrown a few and gotten decent results.

Glad you like it.Ah another lucky coincidence! I like this tradition. Always been amazed by the looks of it. Never seen it up front or tried though. I figured the bloopers and the rotating hammer with the funny church music would make a "lulzy" ban video. I'm not good with video though. For now, it's the best I can do.Something irrelevant to this post: I have been on the forums for a few days in a go. I can see that it is not in the best of conditions (in terms of activity and some technical aspects). I'm working on a long post for the suggestions forum for reviving HTS. Do you think it would be possible to discuss certain aspects of this organization in private with the heads concerned? I am very eager on contributing to this organization ever since performing some deep research on it and estimating it's potential to reach for the stars.

Come on IRC and shoot me, Goatboy, or another moderator a PM. Activity and site features are topics we discuss regularly, although we often don't have the power to implement what we want to get done.

Activity and site features are topics we discuss regularly, although we often don't have the power to implement what we want to get done.That is exactly what I am afraid of. I believe your site was passed down to Kage for overall administration and making choices. I'd liked to have proposed major changes where I would not just provide suggestions, but financial backing and resource provision to some extent. This site had an impact on the world in the past and now its sadly becoming a tomb day by day. We have 46318 users as of the time of this post. With such "active" and "helpful" users, how would such a forum run? I'm sorry I just had to say that. I can go on all day stating problems with this site. What makes me any different from anyone else is that I am seriously interested in providing a helping hand in financial terms and resources. I have read through fashizzlepop's thread "HTS needs to stop sucking" and I was terribly disappointed to see conflict on such a level. HTS is just not any site. It was one of THE best training grounds. Anyways I got carried away. Around what time are you mostly available?

We're all on at different times. Most attempts to have a formal meeting have failed. Basically just get on IRC, ask for a mod/admin, and we'll contact you in due time.

I've not been here long, but the impression I'm getting is there are leadership issues. Maybe its time for a change put in Admins and Mods who have the time to devote time; move those can't devote the time to less involved roles. Its going to be hard to implement anything without a clear direction. But I'm glad to help in any capacity.

It was one of THE best training grounds. I won't maintain the illusion of being happy with the way the leadership system works, but I can assuredly tell you that I'm quite powerless to change it. Regardless, we do have some influence, and I'd at least like to hear your ideas. I'm on IRC now (and usually am most of the day).
