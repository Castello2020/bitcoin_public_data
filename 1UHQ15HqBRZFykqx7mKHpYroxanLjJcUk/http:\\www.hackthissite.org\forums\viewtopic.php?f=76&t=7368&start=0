I'm guessing you haven't browsed around the forums much, because if you had, you would have seen approximately eleventy billion threads identical to this one all receiving the same answer.But, to save you the trouble, I'll reiterate what people with exponentially higher post counts than myself have said time and time again. There is no "quick method", "tutorial", "magical 'hack this site for me' command" or "'pwn this site' button", in the same way that there's no quick approach or cheat sheet for becoming a doctor or a lawyer.It takes time. Lots of it. More than lots of it, in fact. It also takes a willingness to learn and develop yourself _of your own accord_, because surprisingly enough, most people are too busy too be holding your hand through something that they themselves had to take initiative and time (again, lots of it) to accomplish.This site provides you ample resources to get yourself started, and what you cannot learn from here, well... that's what the whole rest of the internet is for. Seriously, you should try this site http://www.google.com, it's incredible.Sorry if I seem to be being a tad harsh, but hopefully you'll get the message.If you don't know where to begin, read the mission description for Basic #1 again. Very carefully. There's a link on there that should get you started.[Edit]@Goatboy - I got half way through this before realising what you said in your first line -_-

I cannot imagine finding the boards helpful without having an average or better than average grasp of English. I can stumble my way through Spanish but wouldn't be able to learn anything useful about computers in that language.Are there not sites like HTS in most other languages?

Computers revolve around English. Seriously. If you are interested in computers you basically have to learn how to read English very well.
