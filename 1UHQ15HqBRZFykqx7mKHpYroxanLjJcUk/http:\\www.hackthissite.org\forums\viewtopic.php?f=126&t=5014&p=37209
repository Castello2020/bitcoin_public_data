Well, I'd love to see it, but since you linked us to your desktop that's going to be exceedingly difficult.

I lol'd.I think everyone goes through that stage where they don't understand that people can't see their local files. I honestly don't recall it myself though; then again.. I barely recall last week in complete clarity. However, I'm sure I was this way once long ago. 'Tis the road we all walk down in our journeys.@the OPTry getting a freewebs account or something and hosting it somewhere we can see it.

Well, that was kind of insulting.I am fully aware that you cannot view my desktop. I simply pasted the wrong link.The name of the file is named after my desktop, and with 20,000 files on this computer, it can get distracting.it should be fixed now.

I will keep donating for sure! ( I have actually donated in the past. I was DangerD205. But my account was inactive for to long.Anyway, I wish I could show you the actual page I made, I will upload it to a script on freewebs in a bit.The actual page is so cool, and I did like 9 Hackthissite.org pages, so it's like you're actually visiting the site.HTS can't be hacked again like in 2005...They are almost to good now.

That was what my original link looked like, but it would not post...As far as the comment YOU posted as me...Very nice. I hope the banana in my ass will help me grow up...Now if you could post it in my real profile as me, that would be something.
