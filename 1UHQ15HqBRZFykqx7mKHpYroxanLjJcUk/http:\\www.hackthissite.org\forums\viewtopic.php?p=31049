It is absolutely amazing for programming (language specific auto-indentation, syntax highlighting, etc) I used nano back when I first started using linux (5-6 years ago), but since I started using vim, I just couldn't go back. After learning how to use it properly, it has saved me tons of time.I have never once had to use regular expression search and replaces. I rarely ever use search and replace as it is.Syntax highlighting is annoying, as is the language specific auto-indentation.I know the reasons for using Vi/m but as I don't require the functionality, I don't see the need to use it.

Do you ever use python? Indentation, at lease, is an absolute necessity. Anyway, with vim you can customize things to be just how you want. Maybe your really not interested though.

Maybe your really not interested though.Of course I indent my code! However I don't like it when my text editor indents for me (I prefer it just to allow me to choose when to indent, and then keep that level of indentation as I add new lines, until I reduce it. That's possible in Nano, so I'm happy).Currently my text editor does everything that I want it to, if I need extra features in the future - I'll be sure to move to Vi.

I agree, auto indentation can get a bit annoying. I remember when it caused me to spend at least an hour reviewing my code, when all I had to do was unindent a single function. If autoindent was off, I never would have had to do that.

Well, you can, of course, make vim do this if you want. Though I suppose you aren't interested in vim in the slightest.

It even backs up the file while you are typing (which has saved me many times when power drops). It is simply an amazing, programmable, editor. But I guess you really don't care about its awesomeness.
