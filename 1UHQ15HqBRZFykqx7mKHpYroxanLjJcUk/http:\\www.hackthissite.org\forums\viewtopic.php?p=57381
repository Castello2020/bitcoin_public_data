by Kaleidoscope on Fri Mar 25, 2011 3:43 am	([msg=55529]see Network wars[/msg])
Me and some of my friends want to have "Battles' (In a sense) Over our local network, Like trying to get root in each others system and make his PC shutdown. Maybe setting up like different objectives, Like copying a file from each other or something. Is this possible over Local network, and if so, Where can we study some of this stuff? We want to study both Attacking and Defending against this stuff, So if you've got good info on both, That would be great, thanks.
The only limit is your imagination

This is a huge subject.When attacking your target, you are going to need to exploit a specific weakness. This can be in the form of insecure code, poor configuration, weak passwords, etc. If the target is not running a service (web, SSH, email, DNS, etc.) it is going to be significantly harder to attack.For defense, a properly-configured firewall as a main defense and an anti-virus as a secondary should be sufficient for your case.

The best available ARp deception, or 135 ports within the network to see him like that. High success rate I am a Chinese high school students. Forgive me my poor English qingtianxiaozhu	New User

I just want to point out that the best defence is to take out your wireless card. No connection the network means no attacks.
I study Gotafu.

So basically it is taking useless services off your port and doing "silent firewalling"/dropping packets unless necessary.The Firewall is your first line of defence, since it will avoid possible attack vectors.IDS, IPS, and AV software is your second line of defence because if a file is modified or somone starts sending commands you would notice and would be able to take action.The third line is to simply know your computer better than an attacker. Try to bust in and do all evil stuff to it before letting anybody connect and attack it. Donate bitcoins to me! [1DhRP3hHgmSLQdRTZyT8VPTmzAj7Z2rsGA]Dunno what bitcoins are? BitcoinMe

MITM using sslstrip or sslify to get around encryption. Viruses can spread over an SSL tunnel just as easily as they can over plain old HTTP. I can walk up to your computer and take the HD out. You might be running a vulnerable service or client. How is encrypting all your traffic making you 100% safe?

Ok I think now is the time where we tell the OP where he can start his hours of reading on network security. Goatboy if you please.
