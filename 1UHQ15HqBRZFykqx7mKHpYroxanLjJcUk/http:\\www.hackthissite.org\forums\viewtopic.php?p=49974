Hello, I am new here and have searched the forum...I have a home network (5 computers on it 1 is a mac) and need to monitor the mac. I want to know what emails are being sent and what her camera on the computer is viewing. btw she my kid! This is a computer that is being loaned to her by the charter school she goes too , if it was her computer I would simply install some software like netnanny to do this.I am using Windows 7 and have a Chater modem.. Not a router..any suggestionson how to accomplish this? Thanks

I can offer a suggestion or two if you can tell me why you'd need a camera feed.

This guy wants to control his underage daughter's webcam...Get on our IRC and talk to a guy named AR about this. He'll be glad to help.

You seem like you're probably a half decent to decent guy, assuming you are who you say you are, and not a pervy next-door neighbor.That being said, monitoring your kids with a camera is simply put: Messed up. We are all lovers of freedom here, and there is no reason to spy on your children. Coming down hard will make them fight back harder, I speak from personal experience: Nothing would piss me off more than when my parents would try to unjustly clamp down on me.Freedom helps you grow as a person; let her. It's totally possible that you have legitimate concerns, but more likely you're misinterpreting, and if she were to find out you're spying on her, it would only push her further away from you.We can't stop you from being overbearing, but acting in that manner almost always makes the situation go sour even more. There are plenty of free tools to sniff data on your local network, Wireshark being the de-facto standard. There are plenty of tutorials as to how to use it properly.But seriously, think about what you're doing.

First, I am her Mother. 2nd this suggestion came from a social worker. and the councilor . Believe me they want me to lock down this computer so EVERYTHING is monitored. However I need to start this email and the camera.I told her I was going to monitor her computers for a while, If I see nothing stupid I would stop. But she too felt "Invaded". I told her the same thing I will tell you guys that feel that way "I am responsible for my children till there 18" Legally ! She has had some issues that frankly are not any of your business! I don't like this idea any more then you do. However being a parent means sometimes we have to do what we really don't want to do because we love our children. When you have kids hopefully your understand..Now I did not come to a Hacking web site for a lecture in parenting, Her councilor and social worker are great for that .Can you help me or not?

I guarantee Msbachman asked about these "problems" because he wanted to offer you advice in good faith. These "issues" are important is that context. Unlike the media portrayal of hackers, we aren't a bunch of low-lives spying on teenage girls and stealing everyone's credit information-We have morals and things we stand for-stripping a teenage girl of freedom and privacy tends to go against that, which is exactly why we have asked for more information.Now, sniffing data on your network isn't particularly difficult, if everything is sent in plaintext, then a MitM attack would harvest pretty much everything. Hacking into her webcam would be more difficult, not to mention extremely unethical. Please don't be defensive, many of us have been in similar situations, and don't think it's the right move. You may be legally responsible for them, but stripping them of freedom in an extreme manner should be a last resort.

You think you have the right to watch every move of hers on a camera because you're her mother?If you don't like what she's doing on the computer (although I doubt her problems you won't mention have anything to do with computers), restrict her access. You're violating her right to privacy by trying to spy on her like some sick pervert.I fail to see what the camera would help you learn, anyway. It's not like seeing her on camera will teach you ANYTHING about what sites she's visiting.
