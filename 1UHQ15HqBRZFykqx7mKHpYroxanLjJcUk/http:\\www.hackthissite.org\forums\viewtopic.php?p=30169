Kage, you could try Bytelove. They do designs for ThePirateBay and a few other geeky website, plus some other geeky shirts etc. They're a little expensive but the shirts are very good quality - I've had my TPB ones for quite a while now and they're still in good condition.Not sure how you go about 'hiring' them though, but: http://www.bytelove.comAlso, they're based in Sweden so how that'd work with American customers I don't know.

When shopping for apparel online, I often enjoy seeing the merchandise being modeled. It gives you a pretty good idea of how it will actually fit. Perhaps we could get some of the moderators to throw themselves upon the sacrificial altar?I think Defience would look particularly fetching in this one.

I run a small T-Shirt printing business. If CafePress doesn't ship to the Philippines can I just take the designs and print them myself? =P

However, the designs currently in HTS Store were SO 2-years ago! I agree that we need new designs, and for a start - I created a NEW design for mousepad, as you can see below. Actual Mousepad:Close-Up:
