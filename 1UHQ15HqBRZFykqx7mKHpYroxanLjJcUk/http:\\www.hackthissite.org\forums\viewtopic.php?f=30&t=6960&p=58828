Executing Network Scan against a Virtual Machine What's the best way to setup a home network? Why should I care about BGP?

Hi. I have a Windows XP running inside a virtual machine (VMWare). How should I use NMAP to target the ports inside the virtualized XP ? Could someone suggest some ways to achieve this ? The host computer is a Debian 6. On linux terminal, it shows vmnet1 and vmnet8 in the ifconfig.

You should be able to see the IP information for the vmnet networks. Scan against those ranges.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

First, you have to get the ip address of the virtual xp. If you assume you can't get it, you should at least know the network address. Suppose that, your vnet1's ip is 192.168.32.1 and vnet8's ip is 192.168.38.1, you can scan 192.168.32.1/24 and 192.168.38.1/4. The virtual xp should be in the scan result.

Vmware default Network adapter is NAT is VMnet8. Just target on VMnet8. Nmap can detect all the port and ip adress torgether.I also try it before.

Or install nmap on the XP machine and do it locally aka 127.0.0.1It'd probably be much easier this way if you're having issues.

But I know how many hours of my life I've wasted just to get things done exactly how I wanted them to be instead of the more efficient way to accomplish the long-term goal. That post was more a reminder than a literal suggestion.The ports will be open locally or remotely if you configure the scan and OS correctly.
