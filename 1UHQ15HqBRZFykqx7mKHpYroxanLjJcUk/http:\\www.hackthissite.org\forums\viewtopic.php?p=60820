Alternatively if they use a proxy they could use a new email and get back in that way !So if they get back in they can do the same again, or maybe behave this time around, either way the perma-ban is circumvented.Just wondering your thoughts on this and have you got a way to stop them doing as I described above ?Great Post GoatboyIn my opinion, some ban by MAC address which is something like a indentification number, so normally unless one knows how to renew their MAC address they would stay banned on that particular site even if they are using a dynamic IP with AOL or using a proxy with a new email to get in.Please correct me if i'm wrong one this Thanks I do alot of different things on alot of diferent mmo type programs, I've found that Second Life, InWorldz, Perfect World, Blue Mars, and now sometimes Runscape, WoW, VSide, and IMVU ban using IP then MAC, and as im told another code, something like a secondary mac that links to the computer directly, (the ladder not experienced by me first hand so I do not know if it is true, [about the secondary MAC thing for those who dont follow]) and I've got a few varying programs and bots that slip by and/or change the 'bannage.' Second Life and InWorldz are espescially easy given a few necessary pieces of knowledge. p.s. I am far from considering myself a hacker and am not trying to brag, just addin my 2cts to confirm that yes MAC is another way to ban, and is waaaay better than IP banning if you're looking for a good quality permaburn. TL;DRYes, MAC Address is also a way, a better one at that, to ban people. The only way to protect yourself is to not build anything worth protecting. Isn't your true enemy obvious, sitexor???obtwV----Vbiteme ^---^

Learn html, javascript, jquery and php. You will also need to implement a database so you can also try checking into mysql or something similar.

I am from Asia and I don't have a problem with that and I don't see why you should. You are obviously retarded, speaking like a 6 year old. Cent was not being racist; he had a point. Whatever you wrote made no sense. It's easier for everyone if you learn to admit your mistakes and stop showing off your wannabe egotistic attitude by writing against older members of the forum. Thank you for telling everyone your zip code, I'm sure everyone will be impressed...@cent...I miss goatboy too ...looking at the ban hammer video now...
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive mefor.
