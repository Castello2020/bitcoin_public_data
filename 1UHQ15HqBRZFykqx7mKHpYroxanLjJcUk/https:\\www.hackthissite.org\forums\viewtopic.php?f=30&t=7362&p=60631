Is basically what I''m going to try and do, As I tried hacking it with Aircrack, and it took me two minutes, which is kinda sad.So I'm going to try and make it near unhackable as much as I can. So Far I've got a new key, switching to WPA2 of course, And using a randomly generated 64-char key. I also am setting up the modem to filter MAC's, Only allowing ones I personally add to the list. Anything else I should know about to bulk up defenses anymore?Modem is an Actiontec M1000, If you know anything about it personally.Thanks

Sounds like you have it pretty much covered. The only thing I can think of now is if someone finds a vulnerability in the firmware and exploits it.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

You probably already know this, but MAC address filtering is very easy to beat. An attacker can easily grab a computer's MAC address from sniffed traffic and spoof his own to be the same. The key however, will be fairly unbeatable.
