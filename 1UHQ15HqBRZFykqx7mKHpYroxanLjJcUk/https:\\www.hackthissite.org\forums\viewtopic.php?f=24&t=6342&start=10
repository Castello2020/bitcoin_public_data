Oh how the kids have erased all the science from computer science "If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise of programs!" - SICP“If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it” - Albert Einstein

Tgoe's post got me thinking of some more devious ideas:1) Open his case and add a totally blank hard drive.2) Go into his BIOS, change the boot order to boot into some f-ed up linux distro with scripts ran at startup to make the screen flicker, music to play repetitively, etc.3) Set bios password so even if he thinks to try to change the boot order back, he'll have to think about how to do it.

Having it flash "You've been pwned" while it's flickering would add to the lulz.

More then the people coming in here blatantly asking us to break into Facebook accounts. More than every idiot claiming to be a badass on the Internet. Why?Because I gave you a legit answer. I took a leap of faith and assumed that you really wanted to learn, and not just try to play Neo. I took it upon myself to steer you away from a road that would undoubtedly end in frustration and failure, and towards a road that will open your mind to new ideas. I did all this because I have been there, and I know what will come of it. And what do I get?"thank you this was some of the help i was looking for...instead of telling me to use Google ..."Had you bothered to understand my post, you would realize that I didn't just say "Google it" and move on. I gave you advice that I have given others before, and they have thanked me for it later. I could have flamed the hell out of you, but I decided to take the high road and help you out in the long run. And in return I get a snarky remark.So there you have it. You've gotten your answers here, now go do it.Agreed. Pandana, listen to the Goat. He has both flamed the hell out of me, and helped me every step of the way. The reason I do the things I do, is to shove it in his face and show him I'm not as big as a noob as he thinks I am (Sanddy helps with this also). But because he has, I've never been so interested in computers (also oddly enough trolling and grammer ). But anywho, don't pass him off as nothing, 'cause he gave you the best advice ever given. Everything else is on you.This is also a thank you to all the HTS staff and users who helped me get where I am today(a little bit less of a noob than I was when I came here, but a noob non-the-less )
Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. -Rick Cook
