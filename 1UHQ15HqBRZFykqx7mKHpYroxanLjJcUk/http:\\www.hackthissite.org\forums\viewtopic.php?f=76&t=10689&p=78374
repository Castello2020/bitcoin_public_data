I want you to be 100% honest with me right now, and don't bullshit because I will know if you're lying:Do you actually want to learn and do the hard work yourself, or would you prefer to be spoon-fed information?I see a lot of people come here asking for us to "teach" them hacking, and what they want is to be told exactly what magic set of programs to run in order to steal facebook accounts and take down governments.So I ask again: Do you really want to learn, or do you want someone to hold your hand and mentor you?
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

Don't make two posts about the same think.viewtopic.php?f=79&t=10688I have a feeling you'll have a hard time getting anyone to help you by doing that.
For those about to rock.
