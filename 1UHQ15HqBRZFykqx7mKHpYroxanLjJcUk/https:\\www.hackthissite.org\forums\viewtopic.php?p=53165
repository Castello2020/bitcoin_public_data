Just some metrics for you guys.. We'll do this with some simple proportions.* According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 760,840 software engineers in the U.S., 304,336 are qualified (2/5 of total).* In the past 60 days, there have been approximately 37,600 unique active user accounts on HTS. X are qualified.* Dilute the results by 1/8th to account for lack of skill, time, caring, etc.Code: Select all 304,336 X------------------------- = -----------------------760,840 + (1/8 * 760,840) 37,600 + (1/8 * 37,600)304,336 X------- = -----55,945 4,2301,287,341,280 = 55,945 * XX = 23,010 * 1/8X ~= 2876This means there could be upwards of 2,876 qualified software engineers on HTS active within the past 60 days, if we view this as a proportional comparison. If we severely skew this even further, past the 1/8th reduction we've already applied, we could say there are 100 qualified software engineers on HTS active within the past 60 days and likely be very correct.Now, the question is, why are people still bitching--if not on the forums, then on IRC or elsewhere--about how "Recode isn't progressing, no one is developing, blablabla..", if there's very likely at least 100 qualified recently active software engineers fully capable of helping out, yet no one has?If people want to help, apply @ hackthissite.org, list your experience and such. Or, post on the forums. Or, get on IRC and ping myself (Kage) or Brendan (bren2010). Or, just complain some more, because that's definitely working.Daily Mindfuck: I bet no one realizes they can use http://forums.hackthissite.org and that it's been usable like this for over 1.5 years.Edit: Fixed my math. And to be honest, even if the math isn't 100% absolutely perfect statistically, the point remains: There are likely a lot of exceptional and qualified developers on HTS, so why isn't anyone stepping forward? I guess it's easier to type a 5 page bitch-rant about how things suck than it is to type 5 pages of code.

Math fail. Better version:Code: Select allU.S. Total Population HTS Forum Population 307006550 43486# of Pop that are Devs # of Pop that are Devs 760,840 or ~.247% 107 or ~.247%# of Devs that are qual. # of Devs that are qual. 304,336 or 40% ~43 or 40%------------------------------------------U.S. Total Population HTS Active Site Population (Last 60 days) 307006550 37600# of Pop that are Devs # of Pop that are Devs 760,840 or ~.247% 93 or ~.247%# of Devs that are qual. # of Devs that are qual. 304,336 or 40% ~37 or 40%------------------------------------------U.S. Total Population HTS Active Site Population (Last 365 days) 307006550 179631# of Pop that are Devs # of Pop that are Devs 760,840 or ~.247% 444 or ~.247%# of Devs that are qual. # of Devs that are qual. 304,336 or 40% ~178 or 40%------------------------------------------U.S. Total Population HTS Total Site Population 307006550 802390# of Pop that are Devs # of Pop that are Devs 760,840 or ~.247% 1982 or ~.247%# of Devs that are qual. # of Devs that are qual. 304,336 or 40% ~793 or 40%This is all of course assuming that both populations are perfectly random (which they are not), are equal in terms of makeup (which they are not), and that all the members of HTS are active (which they are not).EDIT: I figured it would be better to present multiple data sets, instead of relying solely on forum data. Liberally, we are looking at almost 800 developers assuming the statistics are sound for our population. Conservatively, we are looking at less than 40. Clearly this is a large spread. I'll be updating this post as I crunch more numbers and try to find a more reasonable answer.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

I think ~43 is a much more reasonable number than ~1,500.Actually, the HTS total population is approximately 790,000, not 43,500.

760,840 + (1/8 * 760,840) > 55,945

apples wrote:760,840 + (1/8 * 760,840) > 55,945But we don't even know why he added the 1/8 in the first place.UPDATE: I think it's reasonable to take the Active In Last 60 Days group as the final count, which puts us at 40 (rounding up). Let's apply a 25% skew to that to account for the young people, one-timers, ass-hats, and morons. That puts us at 30 good, qualified developers roaming on this site somewhere. This includes, of course, our current staff. Just something to think about.

*sigh..*This thread went from something only partially productive to pissing contests, constant bitching, and doing whatever possible to complain and offer nothing of substance. It has totally lost its focus.If you guys want to help, you can code or write content. apply @ hackthissite.org, or PM myself (Kage) or Brenden (bren2010) on IRC.
