even if you do manage to tunnel your connection out, you will still be using bandwidth and your isp will still be charging you for it.you can try to set up a local web cache which will lower your usage some, Squid might help out. you can also try to set up tor with Squid, so your connection will look like:browser -> squid -> tor network -> internetwhich might help bandwidth usage and anonymity at the same time.for non-web traffic you can try tunneling through tor directly.however, maybe more people can help you if you try to explain your problem better, perhaps with better grammar and spelling.

I'm not entirely sure of what you're asking. Perhaps you should try contacting your ISP?If you're concerned about bandwidth, I suppose using the lynx web browser would use up less, because as it's entirely text-based.
