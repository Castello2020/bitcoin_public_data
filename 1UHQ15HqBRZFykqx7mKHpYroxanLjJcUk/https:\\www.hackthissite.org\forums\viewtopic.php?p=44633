Hacking is a art.What we do is to use this art to make ourselfs more secure.Don't use these techniques to harm others because hackers never harm others, crackers do. And we are Hackers not crackers.

And we are Hackers not crackers.Trolling is a art, too.Seriously, should this thread remain open? I think people are just using it to "prove" their good intentions as a sort of Get Out of Jail Free card later on.

And we are Hackers not crackers.I've never liked the whole hacker-cracker thing. The light side and the dark side is for Star Wars, not real life. I hate script kiddies as much as the next person, but this whole movement to try to separate the word "hacker" from the idea of breaking into systems is ridiculous.Most of the hacker-cracker difference supporters believe that "real" hackers are those that find clever solutions to problems (usually coding problems, but really anything). However, you simply can't write secure code if you don't know how to exploit insecure code. It's just not possible. How "hackers" completely ignore this fact is beyond me.My advice is to stick to the word "hackers" to describe those who find clever solutions to problems (or just solutions in general) - however, if your problem is that you don't have administrative access to a site, so be it. For any kind of hacking that involves running scripts or other tools designed by someone else to "hack" for you without understanding the code, the person using these tools is a script kiddie.
