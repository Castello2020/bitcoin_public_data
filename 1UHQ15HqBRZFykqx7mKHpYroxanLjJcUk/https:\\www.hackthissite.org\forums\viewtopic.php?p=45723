Yes, I know that. My point is chances are we're not going to make a professional design for free. Besides, I can't design for [censored].

You get what you pay for (except in the case of torrents, but I digress).If you ask someone to do something for free, you can't expect them to do it. They may, they may not. If they do, you may not like the quality. The bottom line here is that you want something for free, and don't understand what that means. In addition, you don't "need" a logo. You probably just want one to show off and tell people that you made it. You are not the first person I've seen ask this.Also, I don't see how "i know u guys are expert on it" applies here. This is primarily a hacking forum, not a design forum.

Holy [censored]! This guy is such a [censored] idiot! Not only does he not [censored] read the replies, he keeps on asking for a free [censored] logo. This has got to be one of the most annoying threads I've ever seen in my entire life. I know I'm being a total ass here and I may be waaay out of line (and I know he said he just now wants a guide and some info), but COME ON..for [censored]'s sake. At least, TRY to DO stuff yourself and LEARN, it's good for you. [censored][censored][censored].That's it. Thanks. I'll go away now. /rantPS. @tgoe, did you actually make that or did you use some online program to do it?
