okay, here's my problem, i doesn't need to be particularly efficient, as the desktop i'm using is fine, up until we hit the hard-drive, it's on ten gigs (a real piece of work, eh?)now, which of the many linux systems would be recommended for that, i'm predicting slackware is what will be recommended, as it's VERY stripped down, but i need something a bit more in the middle, as i'm touching on virgin land, i've never used any operating system outside of windows (in general, they are the same), but i don't want one of the microsofty ones, as i'm trying to learn about the system, not just have another computer sitting there...........
give me knowledge or give me death

Best thing about Linux is that because it is free, you can chop and change.Start with Ubuntu, then perhaps try Mandriva, Xandros etc. Just look around for the one you like the best.Most Linux distros are around 500mb-1gb.As for "Microsofty", all Linux systems have the same basis so whatever they look like - start menu etc - they are still Linux.Basically, you just want to learn UNIX.

a good resource for anything about linux is the linux wiki on wikia, http://linux.wikia.com/also, http://distrowatch.com/ is a good place to find distro descriptions and ratings.if you're completely new to linux you might consider trying a 'live' distro, which means that it runs off of some sort of media and doesn't modify your existing operating system unless you choose. that way, you can still experience linux and still keep your old data and OS.

I currently have two machines running, one with a Ubuntu/Kubuntu dual boot hardrive, and another with a Windows OS. I'd like to partition the Windows machine to run a linux distro, but I've had problems with it in the pass (had to do a full recovery after realizing mandriva wasn't going to be totally compatible).My problem is: I'm trying to find a distro that is compatible with an AMD-64 dual core processor chip set. Mandriva worked, but there were problems with the integrated sound card (sound feeding back into the built-in mic).I'm relunctant (after having a full system failure) to just download a distro and try it. I'm looking into openSUSE, but I'd like feedback from someone who knows more than me about it (which is probably any linux user on here ).Any suggestions, or is openSUSE probably the way to go?

you'd need to find out what the chipset of your sound card is and if there is a module for it and if openSUSE has it included or available as a package.

But they all have a Unix core, and are based off of Unix. For example, once you learn your way around the linux command line (ok, technically once you learn your way around BASH) you'll can easily go onto any other Unix based system, like Mac or BSD and use it just as well as almost any other Unix you are already used to.

Another bump for Ubuntu. It's a breeze to set up, nice to beginners, and relatively robust.

However, UNIX does not just define code but defines practices and standards.People say "Learn UNIX" to mean learn about how *nix systems work, learn the command line, etc.Unix, however, is not "basically Mac". Mac is built on the BSD kernel.
