Kill me dead for a typo monica? Yeah but now that its not on the top page nobody is gonna be hearing about it. If cobra didnt mention it I wouldn't of known we had it up already. (This is really just my sneaky way of advertising it)

at the moment it's a live beta/pilot. AR is actually one of our main DJs, i've been DJ'ing techno/dubstep and hip hop late nights (not tonight though), we've even already had a live DJ mixing songs together with a couple decks.Eventually were going to be airing lectures over radio (this will most likely replace ventrillo, though not certainly). Also, were looking for people that can run some talk show like sections every once in a while, maybe a couple interviews or just talk about the latest and greatest tech/hacker news.

I've talked with Monica about this, and she wants me on there 24/7While I can't promise that, I would like to do reviews, news, interviews, other things that end in "ews"
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

All lectures, shows, interviews, etc. need to be recorded. Just saying.
