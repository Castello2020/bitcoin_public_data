ARP Help? Data that travels over the air and how to protect (or decipher) it

Hey everyone.I've been learning a lot about hacking over the past few weeks, and I decided to give it a try. I downloaded Cain from Oxid, and I started messing around with the ARP and sniffer. I am able to run my sniffer and the ARP tool, and I can see that I am poisoning the connection between the router and my other computer, but I have 2 problems.First, when I start poisoning the connection, I end up DOS'ing my other computer, meaning I am unable to sniff any passwords since it isn't sending any. How can I set my computer up to route the packets from the router to the target computer so it maintains an internet connection?Second, I have a 1397 WLAN Mini-card. I'm not sure if this wireless card supports promiscuous mode, and google isn't answering my question. Does anyone know if my card supports promiscuous mode, and if it does, how can I configure it to accept packets sent to other MAC addresses rather than just packets sent to it?

The ARP problem seems more like C&A is only poisoning in one direction. This is weird, because I am pretty sure it is supposed to poison in both. It could be that your router or other comp has some anti-poisoning protection, but I doubt this.As for the wifi card, you can download Wireshark and use it to check. That or aircrack-ng if you have a linux box lying around.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

That's a generic Dell card. My Inspiron has one and Wireshark works just fine for packet sniffing. You should be in good shape.

I've never used cain but ettercap does 2-way ARP poisonings without causing DoS.
