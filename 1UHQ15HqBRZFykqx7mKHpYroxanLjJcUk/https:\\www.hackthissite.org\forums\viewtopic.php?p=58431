After a few 502 errors (I see this as a clear sign of the End of Times) I got the vid to load. Less than 10 minutes in, and I love it already. The hack by Richard Stallman really struck a chord with me for some reason. It's like watching the first life-form being "born".

I was actually thinking that about half way through. I mean I do a lot of my work on Linux, but I still use Windows because it's what I'm used to and I have it configured just the way I need it. Plus, Portal 2.

Wasn't planning on watching the whole thing but 5 minutes in and I see its well worth watching. I just typed Richard Stallman into the firefox search bar and the 2nd google suggestion that popped up was "Richard Stallman is an idiot". I wonder are there really that many people searching "Richard Stallman is an idiot" or did some people deliberately get that into googles suggestions for what ever reasons. The reason I highly suspect its the latter is because I can't imagine that many people consider the founding father of the open source movement to be an idiot.

It's pretty interesting.@thetan It's even based in your home, Silicon Valley I downloaded this documentary a few days ago and it's awesome. For beginners and experts alike. Definitely worth the one hour and twenty five minutes watch. Linux beats all other OSs in my opinion but the problem lies in hardware support which Linux lacks in due to incompetent hardware manufacturers. That's why I am stuck to Windows. Anyways nice video! Thank you for sharing!
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive mefor.

Watched it and found it very interesting.Thanks for sharing.I too am a bit guilty of using windows most of the time.But then there is not much I can do about it as I work with video post production, which requires very advanced graphics editing tools that unfortunatelly are only available on Windows and Mac .

Sorry for the necro post, but I thought it best to let you guys know"Revolution..." The YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated due to multiple third-party notifications of copyright infringement.However, I believe this may have been uploaded by someone else - at a guess is this it?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k84FMc1GF8M
