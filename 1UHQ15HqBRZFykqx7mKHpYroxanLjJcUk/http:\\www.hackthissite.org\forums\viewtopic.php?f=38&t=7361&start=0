by TheJjokerR on Fri May 20, 2011 1:27 am	([msg=57592]see [Javascript] Get iframe html[/msg])
Hey there,Basically on my site, people that are logged into it and visit "example.com/?dosomething=1", can do stuff to their account their.I've already posted successfully to that site, using the token I found in the hidden field of a form on that page(that was the easy part). Now I want to open the site in an iframe, get the html content of that site, get the token, post to that site with the token and do something to their account.The token is also stored in a meta tag on another page if there's an easier way to get that meta tag.Problem here is the javascript same domain policy.. I can't use PHP or another server-side scripting language because that would result in getting a forbidden page, as the server isn't logged into the targets account(obviously)How can I get the HTML contents of the iframe or the meta tag of the site in the iframe.Thanks

You can do this with Perl, Python, or anything with decent networking support. Look up cURL for how to interact with websites from within a program.

If this is anattack experiment you're trying then I would still strongly suggest Python or Perl. The only reasons I could think of you needing to do it in JS are if you are trying to perform some sort of XSS or if you want to do this quickly from any browser. However, these two links might help:http://roneiv.wordpress.com/2008/01/18/ ... d-firefox/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9269 ... javascriptStill a little unclear on what you want, but try that. As for actually posting the data:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1339 ... orm-submit

Alright, let me clarify,The url in the iFrame is on a remote website, I don't have access to it's source so I can't change anything on that website.The first 2 links you posted wont work, because of javascripts' limitations to it's own domain, e.g: if I were to try on of em on the iframe, as soon as I use .contentDocument or .document I will get a security warning and the script will stop running.The last link is what I am doing after this step, I want to post like that and that works fine, but I need a security token for it to get accepted by the server. I found this token manually, but now I need to automate it. So whenever someone goes to the website, it gains the security token and posts 'pretending to be them' in a hidden iframe to the site.Without the security token this wont work, so I need a way to get the source of the page so I can grab the token, and post with it.This could also be done by:- Load page we have here in an invisible iframe,- Fill the form automaticaly,- submit it.Yet I have no idea how to fill the form that is in the iframe :/

Why do you need to fill the form when you can make a form and point it to the same url?And as for grabbing the content, why not use a server-side language?I mean, you have all the information to make an iframe, why not just feed that information to your script? (And maybe get its result, AJAX?)TheJjokerR wrote:Goatboy wrote:You can do this with Perl, Python, or anything with decent networking support.

Problem is with server side scripting, the user wont be logged in. If I use javascript and open the website I need, the target will still be logged in (seeing how 9/10 select "Remember Me"). With that information I can get the security token from their account and post back using my own form.

That would be plainly impossibleBecause if that was possible, every user's account on every site would be hacked by just embbeding an iframe and steal the frame's information

The site I'm trying to exploit has a different way to retrieve the password, what I was trying to do should work to recover passwords without them being mine.Anyways, I might just do this in a simple program that loads the html source and reads it, yet I have no idea how to make sure that firefox and internet explorer's sessions remain active :/
