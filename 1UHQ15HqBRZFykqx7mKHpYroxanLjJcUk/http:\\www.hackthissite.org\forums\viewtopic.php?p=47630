Hi guys My name is Michael. I found this site 3 years ago, when I was in 6th grade, while looking for programming challenges. I decided I didn't know enough about HTMlL, PHP, and general problem solving skills to continue, so now that I have grown with experience, I have come back. I have a passion for computers, and want to have a job in the programming field in my future, hopefully getting accepted into a good school in Chicago or Boston (any suggestions?).I enjoy parkour, computers, free running, nature, video games, and history.By the way, sorry for the grave dig xP

Hi HTS members, I'm 25 and am close to finishing my bachelors in Computer Science. Do you think it's important to have hacking skills If I plan to be a software developer? If it's important to know, I'd rather not be ignorant about it but should I even know about this stuff in the first place? Thanks!

However, if you've got the mindset to only learn how to hack because it will be useful for your job, you definitely have the wrong mindset. It's about gaining an understanding of systems purely for the sake of understanding them.Anyway, since you seem set on the usefulness of it, I can guarantee an understanding of technology will be immensely helpful. We teach a lot more than hacking, you know.

Hello,I am 24 and a semester out from finishing an Information Systems degree. I have taken classes in web development, programming( java, VB, C#), database management and am currently working through some Cisco networking books. I have joined this site to learn more on hacking for a collegiate competition that my school is joining for the first time this year. Hopefully I can learn something that will be useful.
