I've been working on a robot and progress has been stopped because of a lack of any kind of computer to run a program to make the robot work. Being a cheep a$$, I thought it might be possible to re-program a simple calculator to be used as the "brain" of my bot so I got a Casio SL-300SV and did some google-ing. There were absolutely no helpful results.I think you see where this is going. Thanks in advanced for any information.

Moved to Hardware.This is a good question. People have certainly re-purposed hardware in the past, so I would assume it's at least plausible. Depending on how the firmware is stored (EEPROM, ROM, etc.) it may or may not be easy to do. If the calculator allows firmware upgrades (like the TI-83+ does) then it should be relatively easy to create your own firmware.Else, just get an arduino.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

Considering the kind of calculator this is, I highly doubt you'd be able to reprogram it to your needs.

I would suggest using Arduino since the processor on the calculator might not be enough to control a robot and all of its motors/sensors.http://www.arduino.cc/Other than that Goatboy's post is really good.
