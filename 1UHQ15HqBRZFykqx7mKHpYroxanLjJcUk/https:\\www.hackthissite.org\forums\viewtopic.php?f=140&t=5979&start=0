Friday's Lecture On 9/17... Was successful! Well, semi-successful, but we are almost at the end of the rainbow! We absolutely appreciate the time that you took to participate in the lecture, and I hope you did find the discussion on Computer Forensics interesting! However, we do apologize for the lack of organization since it was a trial run, a PRE-lecture. We did not want to focus on one particular subject, since we assumed there were going to be less than 6 people. Surprisingly, we were WRONG! At the same time, we were very grateful that many have showed up to the lecture! Because we definitely see that lectures have potential to remain on HackThisSite, we definitely owe you this - more detailed topics, more time for lectures, more organization, and even more entertainment! So join us NEXT THURSDAY, 9/23 at 7:00 PM EST for the lecture! The hot topic will be on Linux. We will break down to subtopics:a.) Introduction to Linuxb.) Linux distributionsc.) Installation of Linuxd.) Configuratione.) Commands-You-Need-To-KnowOf course, we will be utilizing IRC and Ventrilo, as MOST of you found it convenient, entertaining and fun to communicate and enjoy the lectures. IRC and Ventrilo information below:Ventrilo Server: vent.infinite-gaming.org, Port: 9765IRC Server: irc.hackthissite.orgIRC Channel: #lectureSEE YOU ALL THERE! hi am new so plz dont troll me or i report 2 the HTS mods ty

Monica exaggerates - we weren't very organized, but it was still a good lecture (and we all learned a lot, especially regarding computer forensics).EDIT: I'm uploading the recording now.

Well I still. We should introduce the staff again. But anyways I agree that there should be more entertainment.

Considering it was the first lecture, and it was mentioned beforehand that it was not going to be specific to one topic, I think it went rather well.A number pennies dropped for me this evening just listening to the guys who were doing most of the speaking, and after Goatboy's talk on forensics, my curiosity for the subject has been sparked - which I guess is kinda the point of these lectures in the first place.Looking forward to the next one if this one was anything to go on - and if it bombs, Bieber can always sing for us...

My opinions:Despite the initial disorganization, it went well overall. We had about 2.5x the turnout we thought we'd have, which is nothing short of amazing. You guys seemed to be very interested in what was covered, but I was surprised at how few questions you had. Speak up! You guys essentially run the lecture. There were a few times when I just kinda rambled on and on filling up space. Let's try to avoid that. Nobody wants to hear me talk that much (except maybe mRmasteRful).I was little disappointed in the high volume of trolling/spamming. Being our first run, I expected a little more cooperation and maturity. That's all I'm going to say on that matter; no sense dwelling on it.As Monica said, I promise the next lecture will be more structured. We might not have a word-for-word manuscript, but we will definitely have a more solid plan for what to speak on. I present best when speaking off the cuff (feels more natural and relaxed) but with a rough guideline.That said, I can't wait to do the next lecture. Let's hope for at least as many people, preferably more.-- Goatboy

Lecture was a success. People came and more importantly people learned. Heeck even though imcrafty didn't listen to a thing goatboy was saying she learned how to use vent. Only way to go from here is up. Good job HTS staff.Sweet we're doing linux next. Could you guys maybe talk about portal linux like on a flashdrive. How limiting this type of set up might be etc. Don't worry I'll be there with questions and please make sure goatboy is lecturing again I get off to his voice.
