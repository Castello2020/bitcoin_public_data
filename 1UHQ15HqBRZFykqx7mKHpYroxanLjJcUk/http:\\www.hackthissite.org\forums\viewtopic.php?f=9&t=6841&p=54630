you'll never be a "good" hacker.. At most, you may become decent in the subject. Nobody is a "good" hacker, because there is so much out there. Unless they're goats.. Anyways, in 5 years things will be updated, and what you learn could be obsolete.

Hacking is not a formula. You don't study X hours a day for Y days and become a good hacker. It takes a lot of dedication, studying, experimentation, failures, successes, and a fair amount of luck (in your genetic makeup; not everyone can do this stuff well). One person might get it right away, and another could study for years and still be lost. Furthermore, I think you have a pretty foggy idea of what hacking is. If you think hacking is learning HTML, then it should only take about 30 minutes, to be honest. If your goal is to break into websites, then I think you should look elsewhere.tl-dr; Don't try to quantify your skills, just learn.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk
