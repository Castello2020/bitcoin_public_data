The year is almost over, and we have seen much stupidity in the last 12 months. From TheWhiteKid's source code failure (which was technically this time last year) to the recent "How to view someone's IP address and connection speed" article submission, we have been steadily supplied with idiocy of all forms.But now, in the last few days before the year is out, we must vote for the Idiot of the Year!This year's 7 contestants are:Please touch me privatelyAllergic to criticismM4J0R H4L0 6LI1TCHHao 2 hax ne ASPTheWhiteMultielite-hackers.com is elitetracert is srs bznsYou have 'til the 31st.

I'm going to have to go with "Allergic to Criticism". The sheer amount of self-loathing narcissism in that thread is just pure gold.

How have we forgotten plx stroke my hard drive so quickly?He edited his first post, but the tldr of that thread is he's into computer bdsm and wants you to grab him by his computer-balls and talk sexy to him. Yes, he's for real, and no, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with him.

"Touch me privately" got my vote. Not only was the story something off of Jerry Springer, but the actual statement, please touch me privately to discuss particulars... had me rolling and still does whenever I think about lol. WTF!
