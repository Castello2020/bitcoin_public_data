Googles owns gmail and youtube so when I'm using the search engine I'm not surprised seeing myself logged in with those accounts at the top right corner of the screen but they're not the only accounts they log me in as. They log me in with my gmx account and they even log me in with my horsemail account. Theres no way google owns horsemail.com. How does google know when i log into these 2 sites? It doesn't log me in with hotmail or ymail accounts for some reason.

It's likely that those accounts use Google as their platform.. or they have an information / login sharing agreement with Google. See what happens if you disable cookies and/or javascript, see if the information is being picked up through your browser or your session.. or it it's being sent from server to server.

Because of Google-Analytics and Adservice that include a nasty tracking cookie. Search up TACo and NoScript for your protection.

I doubt it is the Analytics tracking cookie that does it. If anything, it would be a general Google cookie or as Tremor said.

It's extremely hypocritical that you tell sanddbox, myself, and the other mods to be professional, then you leave the site to play games and only come back to failtroll.

@op: if you are logged into any social networking site these days.. facebook, twitter, digg, stumble, google and more.. all of these sites have web developer applications that share information. This is the basis of the share/like/digg/buzz revolution... that if you are on xyz.com you can hit a button and have it broadcast to all of your accounts that you were on and liked xyz.com! How fun! NOW LETS PUT IT ALL TOGETHER ---- http://www.rockmelt.com/ Why not just give in and let the internet know everything... get rockmelt today!

Holy fucking shit... from some reason I decided to click on Google Reader, and it pulled up stuff from TheOatmeal.com, National Geographic, the iPhone App World Lens, and How the Japanese Multiply. I haven't put any of this out on the internet. Not my Facebook status, Twitter. I do go to TheOatmeal.com regularly and do find stuff like that interesting, but it's creepy as hell Google was able to pull all that up.Bren2010 when he saw this wrote:But... but... but... Facebook never told me Google requested access to my brain. Fuckers... surely there's something about this in the privacy agreement...
