A copy of Origin of the Species might though.

in my opinion...ethics have arisen from a collection of social constructs that enable us, and civilisations before us to exist, rather than destroy ourselves entirely, purely for stability.and because of evolution, and through nurture rather than nature, we inherit ethical views through our exposure to our environment, some could say ethics are unnatural and are imposed on us by external influences, and that man is essentially a primal beast, with higher order thinking capacity.Man is a continual struggle between the primal desires and natural drives of our ancestral DNA, and our civilised ideals of ethics, culture, and our outlook on the world.Thoughts?
