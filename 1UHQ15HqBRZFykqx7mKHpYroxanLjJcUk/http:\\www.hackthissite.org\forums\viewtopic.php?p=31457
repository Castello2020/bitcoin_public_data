Well I meant if we know something by seeing solid evidence, rather than by spiritual confirmation. If you have been confirmed something by the Spirit, and you know with certainty that its true, wouldn't you consider that knowledge?

You cannot have something "confirmed" by the Spirit any more than a delusional schizophrenic can have something "confirmed" by the voices in his or her head.See, this is what bothers me. People claim to have things revealed to them by a voice/image/dream/etc. and they take it as the absolute truth! People who are otherwise logical, intelligent individuals believe in fairy tales and superstitions.

And a delusional schizophrenic seems hardly comparable, as they have a condition that practically guarantees delusion. How do you know that they are fairy tales and that the Spirit are all so fake if you have never really tried to gain a spiritual confirmation? If you are so set against religion, how can you ever find out for yourself whether it is true (without bias)? I have come to know for myself that my beliefs are true.

I grew up Methodist. I was confirmed near the end of 10th grade, and baptized in the waters of George Lake in Spicer, Minnesota a month later during a week-long stay at Decision Hills camp. I went on a mission trip later that year to Atlanta, Georgia and helped repair an old church in a poor suburb. I have packaged food to be shipped to Uganda via Feed My Starving Children (And almost got to meet Johnny Long, but that's another story) several times.During this whole time, I never really felt like I fit in. I didn't feel this "Light" that everyone was talking about. I never got a personal message from God. I was worried. I prayed. I didn't hear a response. There was no "revealing moment" when my eyes were opened. Life just went on. I thought I was doing something wrong, so I prayed harder. I thanked God for every little thing, from getting a good grade on a paper to recovering from a sickness. Nothing came of it.It was about this time, in the middle of 11th grade, that I started to seriously doubt God. Why was I not getting a message? Why did it seem like random chance when things went well? Why did people die, get hurt, fall into debt, get tortured, and yet nothing was done about it? I had so many questions, yet no answers. That's when it hit me, when I finally got that "revealing moment" I had been waiting for: God probably does not exist.Everything from that point on was clear. People suffered because of chance, or because of oppression, not because God planned it for them. I got good grades because I studied, and when I got a C or a D, it's because I slacked off. Debt was not a test of faith, it was a test of budget planning. Once I took God out of the equation, logic took over and I stopped having questions; I had answers.So don't tell me I've never tried to gain a spiritual confirmation. Trying to do so was one of the worst times in my life, when I felt so alone, so abandoned by this "Loving God." That is why I am who I am today, and I do not regret it at all.

The godhead, Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, are 3 separate beings. The three form the godhead, but we have one God (our Heavenly Father). They are just united in purpose. I too don't understand how some find the godhead to be a single trinity. A single being with multiple personality disorder seems a bit unrealistic.
