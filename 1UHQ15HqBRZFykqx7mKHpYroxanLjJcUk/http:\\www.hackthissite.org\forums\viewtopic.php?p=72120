by Lestat84 on Wed Jan 02, 2013 11:07 pm	([msg=71979]see Connected but No Access[/msg])
Hi everyone. I am at a boarding school where access to the schools' network is blocked after 10:30 pm. I can connect to the network just fine, but i can't load pages or use skype or anything at all. VPNs used to be a workaround but now they have taken steps against that so there is flat out no way to load anything that I'm aware of. Is there a way around this? Also I have a windows 8 and Xubuntu 12.04 LTS computer. One is a laptop, the other a desktop and no, there is no ethernet access either. my main goal is skype access on my Xubuntu laptop, but even more useful solutions are appreciated assuming there are any. Thanks guys.

Thanks guys.I'm not sure what they are doing to prevent access, if you could tell me more about it?As of now I would suggest the obvious, get Tor and proxychains. With those, you should be able to run Skype via proxychains with Tor's Socks5. Do this in your *nix distro. You could also get dirty and try other things, but that's kinda too black hat for me to speak on.Message me back and let me know!

Thanks guys.Try doing some network debugging. Get a rough map of your network, ping everything, figure out what the default gateway is. After you have some idea of how the network is set up, try running a tracert command on, say, google.com when you have internet, and then run the same command when the internet is down. Compare results. I'm just guessing right now, but what they may have done is simply flip a switch at 10:30 which blocks the connection between the router and the modem, or just simply shut off the router. If that is the case, then you should still be able to connect on the local network, just not out to the internet (or should we say, inter-router-net). To test this, find the IP of a one of your own devices (make sure it is on at the time) and try pinging it with another device across the network, they should ping just fine, even with the internet down.

I despise the IT department at my school so I'll do anything to spite them lol.

My knowledge is very poor when it comes to changing how something effects services via internal IP's, and for that I am sorry I can't help.

Just out of curiosity I would try nmap and see what is able to be seen before you have access and after then possibly look into network traffic at both times. If they restrict your access out to the internet are you still able to ping other machines on the local network?

i am pretty sure that the access blocking is an internal protocol within the network. i am shown to be connected, but loading any webpages stalls and anything that requires internet does not connect. tor does not help nor do proxies. it's very frustrating.
