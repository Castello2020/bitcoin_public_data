I'm fairly certain it is. And if it's not, they have to take me down with you!Here's mine. I have no artistic ability; my focus is on writing. I haven't really submitted a lot that's good, in my opinion. Just a lot of stuff that helped me get through some rough patches. I am proud of my featured work, though.

@ Goatboy - I love the art. Is that the Hacker Emblem in the binary picture?

Thanks for the offer, but seeing as it was one I made on my computer, I would be somewhat surprised if it showed up online.
