Burning the Koran is the worst possible thing those rednecks could cook up as a way of 'justice' because of the mosque that was being built near the location of 9/11 (I don't even consider 2 blocks away near). They are basically telling Muslims to fuck off, and considering the fact that 93% of Muslims are moderates, don't you think letting some of the biggest bigots in the USA at the moment get the world's attention and burn the Koran make that number go down significantly?

As much as I loathe religion, I can't condone the burning of any literature. Islam has as much right to exist, and express themselves, as any other institution of faith or lack thereof.Seeking to destroy something that you disagree with, or don't understand, is a mark of individuals who are both unintelligent and insecure in their own beliefs. They should be crushed betwixt my cloven hooves.My source about Islam... My own copy of the Qur'an, multiple Muslims that I've met and worked with, and a fascination with 12th-century Ismaili Muslims.

However, doing so may also show that you are a closed-minded bigot. Just saying.I, too, own a Qur'an. Haven't read much of it, but the imagery is beautiful.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

It burns.As to my opinions on the matter, my position is similar to Goatboy's (as always). They are free to burn as many Qur'ans as they wish - that's their right. However, they're unintelligent, bigoted morons to do so. Showing America as a country of intolerant holy book burners isn't going to make the less-extremist Muslims (many of whom live in America) like us any more.TL;DR: It's their right, but they're still [censored]* for it.*In answer to the trolls, this is the only major part of my posting that I have changed since I have become mod. Blame Monica.

Language barrier aside, yes, I think I see the point that you're making. However, when learning about a religion, I feel that it's equally important to consider historical research just as much as, if not more than, religious doctrine. I won't blame a modern community for it's long past actions, but I like knowing where they came from and what they did to get to where they are now. A broader picture, instead of a narrower one, so to speak.Very off topic though, so I'll leave it at that.
