Alright so first off there is a comment on the home page that says <!-- Welcome HTS --> You may hack this site. However I would prefer that no one attempts anything on the feedback page because I would then have to manually delete all posts on the page. If you do find something please let me know! Thanks everyone.P.S.If you would like if you do manage to hack this sitelet me know and I can add something in the news section about it and mention your name or you can stay anonymous.

Naturally i went straight to the feedback page but noticed Code: Select allGreat job, man &lt;3 so I take it you took at least some measures to secure it.Also'All abusive posts (hacking attempts) have their I.P. addresses logged.'the request for http://lawofcode.com/admin was me. I'm not as crafty as i used to be haha Goatboy wrote:Oh, that's simple.

Hey I took a look at your site, I didn't bother trying to hack it because I'm no good at hacking but I did notice that your page is very static, width ways, I would recommend that you use percentages for your site so it re-sizes better for phones. Just a suggestion =D

Look for something like this:¼script¾alert(¢XSS¢)¼/script¾Well i can load the page. Host may have just gone down again. I have been trying to get some stuff in motion to get a better host. It goes down everyonce in a while. The php script strips html and also quotes.

True: "host is fgt", False: "Can't change those"create a .htacess file in the public_html directory.Inside the .htacess file add this:Code: Select all Options -IndexesYou could also create a custom 404 error message and add a redirect to it with something like:Code: Select allErrorDocument 404 /foo/bar.php
