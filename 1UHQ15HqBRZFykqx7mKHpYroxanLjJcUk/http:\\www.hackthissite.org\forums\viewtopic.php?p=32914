Social Engineering at its best. Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. While similar to a confidence trick or simple fraud, the term typically applies to trickery for information gathering or computer system access and in most cases the attacker never comes face-to-face with the victim.

The Reason this was such an epic scam is because the guy who initiated it was a well respected regular on the forums, just goes to show you that even after 2000 posts, a regular might still scam his fellow forum members.Basically Read first page,then skip to last,and you get the jest. http://forums.clantemplates.com/showthread.php?t=143478

The fact that he's been around awhile probably made everyone trust him to a good extent. Just goes to show that you really never know who's sitting behind that screen.

That just sucks. But still, what a great and public example of how no one can be trusted.

Lol, Monica Anyway, it's too bad, but you have to assume the worst and hope for the best with people these days. Especially on the internet.
