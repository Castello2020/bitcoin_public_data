Well I was at barnes and noble ad saw this book: steal this compute book 4.0I was generally interested so I bought it. Now I've been reading it and I'm pretty sure it's outdated. It came out in 2006, and am curious if anyone else has read it. Is the info useful? Thanks Fascination	New User

I read it a while ago. Can't remember how much of it was useful, but I remember it was an interesting read.
Assume that everything I say is or could be a lie.1UHQ15HqBRZFykqx7mKHpYroxanLjJcUk

All information on computers can be useful, even old Txtfiles that were floating around BBS systems make a great read.That being said...www.phrack.orgwww.textfiles.com
