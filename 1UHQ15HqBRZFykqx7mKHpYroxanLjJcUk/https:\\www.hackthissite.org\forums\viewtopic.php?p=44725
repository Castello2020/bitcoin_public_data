I voted for more missions because it is always great to have more options. Open-source: because the community might suprise you with what it can accomplish.Code database: because it would make it is always nice to have code to read through.

I'm pretty sure HTSv5 will be using a git repository, so anyone will be able to push their own version. In another words, this idea is going to be implemented.Regarding a code database: I like the idea, although obviously HTS challenge solutions (like the programming missions) should not be published.

Newbie filter, anything that can reduce the "How do U hack _____(fill in the blank)" posts is great.More challenges, the more you do the more you learn.Code database, great idea, HTS mission code should only be viewable after completing the mission. There's usually more than one way to solve a challenge, it would be great to see different approaches.
Never stop learning.

Noob Filtering: being new myself I can agree with this one...although on the flip side of this I would say that perhaps the new folks shouldn't be ridiculed and put down as much as they are. I know there are the actual idiots who come here asking for the dumbest of things. There are those who are genuinely here to learn something and may make a mistake and don't deserve to get slammed for it. It happens, no one here started knowing everything and a site that has a banner saying Training for the Hacker Underground should perhaps be a little more receptive to new folks. More realistic missions: Although I have a ton of missions to finish, I like them and think the more the merrier.Code database: There is a lot of info here...I'd like to see what people can come up with. Maybe in group projects similar. Perhaps working together on things rather than flame each other could be a more productive approach. Just my opinions as a new person.

I believe it would be cool if we could see the php files of hts(without the username and password and all that secret shit which shouldn't be viewed by us), and more realistic challenges are definitely a plus.
