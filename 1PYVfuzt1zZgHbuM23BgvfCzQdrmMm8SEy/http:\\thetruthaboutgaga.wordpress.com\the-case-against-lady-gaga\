				<div class="entry-content">
<p>Lady Gaga has been described as &#8220;a voice for our generation.&#8221; She is a woman on the verge of releasing <em>Born This Way,</em> a potentially world-changing record which one person has called &#8220;the greatest album of this decade.&#8221; The  lead single of the same name has been dubbed the &#8220;anthem for our  generation.&#8221; Her concerts have been deemed &#8220;youth churches,&#8221; and, as  someone once put it: &#8220;the bitch can sing.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>The Truth About Lady Gaga<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Lady Gaga&#8217;s favorite subject is Lady Gaga. She envisions herself as an enigmatic riddle wrapped inside a mysterious paradox. For my inability to understand this infinitely complex figure, I&#8217;m constantly being bashed over the head by her Monster Cult: I simply &#8220;don&#8217;t &#8216;get&#8217; her,&#8221; they say. Browse YouTube comments or Twitter flame wars: her detractors are told that they fail to understand Gaga&#8217;s deeper points about celebrity, fame, and art. If we understood what she was aiming at, we&#8217;re told, we&#8217;d stop aiming our bayonets at her and proclaim ourselves Little Monsters, too.</p>
<p>In this essay &#8212; which will be ever-growing &#8212; I intend to chronicle, in fairly comprehensive fashion, why I totally <em>do</em> &#8220;get&#8221; Lady Gaga &#8212; and why to understand her is not to embrace her.</p>
<p>2010 was a watershed year for her &#8212; but for all the wrong reasons. Having achieved fame, she has shed the arty, self-knowing persona of her early period and has come to embody all of the pop life&#8217;s worst attributes: egomania, pretension, and self-importance, topped off with a big, steaming pile of histrionics.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin by examining what exactly a &#8216;Little Monster&#8217; is.</p>
<p><strong>The Sociology of the Monster Cult</strong></p>
<p>The first notable point about the term &#8216;Little Monster&#8217; is that it did not evolve organically, as was the case with, say, Justin Bieber&#8217;s equivalent, the &#8216;Beliebers.&#8217; Lady Gaga herself decreed that her followers were her &#8216;Little Monsters,&#8217; and they obediently followed suit in adopting the terminology. It was not a creation of the fans: &#8216;Mother Monster&#8217; simply started calling them that during her concerts (or &#8216;youth churches,&#8217; as she has called them) and they adopted the moniker without protest.</p>
<p>No big deal. But why &#8216;monsters&#8217;? Let&#8217;s allow Gaga to explain herself. Here, in her own words: the full text of the &#8216;<a href="http://ladygaga.wikia.com/wiki/Manifesto_of_Little_Monsters">Manifesto of Little Monsters</a>.&#8217;</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s something heroic about the way my fans operate their cameras.  So precisely and intricately, so proudly, and so methodically. Like  Kings writing the history of their people. It&#8217;s their prolific nature  that both creates and procures what will later be perceived as the  &#8220;kingdom.&#8221; So, the real truth about Lady Gaga fans lies in this  sentiment: They are the kings. They are the queens. They write the  history of the kingdom, while I am something of a devoted Jester.</p>
<p>It is in the theory of perception that we have established our  bond. Or, the lie, I should say, for which we kill. We are nothing  without our image. Without our projection. Without the spiritual  hologram of who we perceive ourselves to be, or to become, in the  future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first thing that&#8217;s notable about this startlingly incoherent manifesto is that it&#8217;s actually <em>not</em> a manifesto. A manifesto is a body of work outlining the intentions and core components of an ideology or movement. Gaga&#8217;s two-paragraph brain-droppings can be described as many things, but &#8216;manifesto&#8217; is not a term that comes to mind.</p>
<p>Second, if the manifesto is <em>of</em> Little Monsters, then it ought properly to be written <em>by Little Monsters</em>, not Lady Gaga. (And the word &#8216;prolific&#8217;? I don&#8217;t think it means what she thinks it means.) A proper fan community should be allowed to grow organically. But from the naming of the community to the expression of its ideas, the Monster Cult seems to be a strictly top-down operation: Lady Gaga issues the decrees, and the Monsters follow suit.</p>
<p>Gaga&#8217;s inscrutable ramblings aside, the common explanation seems to be that &#8216;monster&#8217; is a tongue-in-cheek reference to what is allegedly the nature of the typical Lady Gaga fan: eccentric, a bit freakish, maybe a bit of a misfit. Mother Monster thus styles herself as the Queen of the Misfits; a public representation of the positive, artistic role of the outcast. She diligently thanks her Monsters in all of her public speeches and appearances, declaring them her reason for living and even the true writers of <em>Born This Way.</em> In October 2010, Lady Gaga even <a href="http://bumpshack.com/2010/10/31/lady-gaga-as-a-little-monster-for-halloween-twitter-photo/">took to her Twitter</a> to announce that, for Halloween, she was going to dress up as a Little Monster.</p>
<p>It takes a special kind of egomania to dress up as a fan of yourself for Halloween. But then, Lady Gaga&#8217;s arrogance &#8212; already thoroughly documented in the first paragraph &#8212; is pretty extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>Breathtaking Arrogance</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The funny thing is that some people have reduced freedom  to a brand.  They think that it&#8217;s trendy now to be free. They think  it&#8217;s trendy to be  excited about your identity. When in truth, there is  nothing trendy  about <em>Born This Way</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Gaga spoke <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1653141/20101129/lady_gaga.jhtml">those words</a> as November 2010 drew to a close; the statement was a seeming allusion  to a recent duo of #1 pop hits: Ke$ha&#8217;s &#8220;We R Who We R,&#8221; and Katy  Perry&#8217;s &#8220;Firework,&#8221; <em> </em>both of which emphasize self-expression and individuality.</p>
<p>Gaga&#8217;s statement is perplexing on a couple of levels. Somewhere along  the line, this woman seems to have convinced herself that her music is  about personal liberation, individuality, and self-expression. A cursory  glance at Gaga&#8217;s small catalog of music reveals that she has written a  grand total of <em>zero</em> songs emphasizing this theme. And her most  visible songs undercut the message on a grand scale: her major hits have  been about getting wasted at a party (&#8220;Just Dance&#8221;), having sex (&#8220;Poker  Face&#8221;), and ignoring your boyfriend while you&#8217;re clubbing  (&#8220;Telephone&#8221;). Who exactly, then, is Lady Gaga to be lecturing anyone  else about lyrical themes?</p>
<p>The point I&#8217;m making here is not that there is something wrong with  singing about booze, boys, and parties, but rather that if Lady Gaga is  going to parade herself around as an exemplar of personal liberation,  she really ought to write a song about something other than, well &#8212;  booze, boys, and parties. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the topic, really: but can we please try not to pass it off as high art?</p>
<p>Worse, still: if Lady Gaga is serious about encouraging young people  to embrace their identities, why on Earth would she be spitting upon  others&#8217; efforts in furthering this message? Ke$ha and Katy Perry are  high-profile pop singers, after all. One would think that Gaga would want to <em>thank</em> them for embracing a positive message. One would think that she would view them as <em>allies</em> in helping others. But alas, this  is not the way that Lady Gaga operates: the disgusting truth seems to be  that she simply wants the stage to herself. (Perhaps, one might venture,  she&#8217;d recognized that the music she&#8217;d released to that point had  absolutely nothing to do with individual expression &#8212; and was thus  angry that other artists beat her to the punch.)</p>
<p>The obvious retort here by the Monster Cult is that Lady Gaga has  been hard at work on an album full of songs about individual expression,  self-acceptance, and personal liberation. This is, at least, what I&#8217;ve  been breathlessly informed of by the Monsters: she&#8217;s using  mindless pop to get her foot in the door, or so goes the line &#8212; and <em>then</em> she&#8217;ll unleash her high art.</p>
<p>Fine. Maybe so. (Although, given the asinine inanity of the lyrics of  &#8220;Born This Way,&#8221; I highly doubt it.) <em>But right now, we&#8217;ve heard nothing  but talk</em>. It would be bad enough if she&#8217;d released a song or two about  individuality and then hit the road as a one-woman hype machine for her  own brilliance. That&#8217;s color-by-numbers, par-for-the-course industry arrogance, and it&#8217;s never  becoming. But Gaga&#8217;s arrogance is virtually unprecedented: it takes a special kind of audacity to take cheap shots at  others for putting out allegedly inferior versions of art <em>that you have yet to even produce!</em></p>
<p><strong>Strange Lies</strong><em> </em></p>
<p>MTV <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1654708/20101221/lady_gaga.jhtml">reported</a> that Lady Gaga made this strange remark during one of her London shows:<em><br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now, I don&#8217;t know if you know this, but for those of you  who don&#8217;t know, I write all my own music. Every single lyric, melody  and note was created by me. I am not manufactured. I&#8217;m a bad cat and  coming for you &#8217;cause I believe in you and I. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like  to be humble, it&#8217;s just that pop music has a pretty bad rap&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jacques of The Prophet Blog says <a href="http://www.theprophetblog.net/lady-gaga-now-says-she-writes-and-produces-everything-by-herself">all that needs to be said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder what RedOne, Darkchild, Fernando Garibay, Rob  Fusari, Akon, Martin Kierszenbaum, and about fifty other engineers,  backing vocalists, producers, writers, musicians, marketing assistants  and A&amp;R reps would have to say about that?</p></blockquote>
<p>In summary: <em>Gaga&#8217;s statement is objectively, provably false. This is not an opinion.</em></p>
<p>Some fans, mentally rejecting any negative information about Mother  Monster that arrives at their desks, have rationalized this bizarre  statement by claiming that Gaga comes up with all of the lyrics and  melodies to her songs, and that the producers just add the  instrumentals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to understand why this explanation is appealing to the Monster Cult: since  nobody has specifically claimed credit for individual sections of each  song, the melodies and lyrics can be chalked up to Gaga and her integrity, statement and all, remains roughly in tact. (To the Little  Monster, the alternative &#8212; to admit that she&#8217;s such an egomaniac that  she feels that she can openly take credit for others&#8217; work in front of the world &#8212; is  unthinkable.)</p>
<p>Alas, the contention is too far-fetched to hold water. First of all,  unless we are to dismiss the production as unimportant, irrelevant, or  otherwise not notable, this <em>still</em> doesn&#8217;t explain why Gaga  would claim credit for &#8220;every note&#8221; on the album. (The album kicks off  with &#8220;Just Dance,&#8221; for instance, which begins with a synthesized &#8220;E.&#8221;  That qualifies as a note, yes? That&#8217;s part of the production, yes? Which  is credited to &#8212; why, I believe it&#8217;s&#8230;RedOne.) But furthermore, there  is a marked quality difference between her work with marquee-name  producers and the B-listers she chose to play around with. &#8220;Summerboy&#8221; is a passable pop song, but it&#8217;s no &#8220;Boys Boys Boys.&#8221; Left  to her own devices, Gaga seems to prefer to write rock ballads, such as  &#8220;You and I&#8221; or &#8220;Speechless.&#8221; The intense, driving dance-pop sound that  has become Gaga&#8217;s signature is virtually all RedOne&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p><strong>Manufactured This Way</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget it, but there are several videos that exist of a  young woman named Stefani Germanotta performing soulful, smooth-jazz  ballads for eager New York audiences. Germanotta — the woman lurking  underneath the layers of “Lady Gaga” that have been applied to her —  never felt the need to adorn herself in bras made out of meat, collect  gay men as fashion accessories, or declare her concerts “youth churches”  for politically active students.</p>
<p>Rob Fusari, the man behind &#8220;Paparazzi,&#8221; has felt compelled to dish on  Gaga&#8217;s manufactured personality. Explaining that she&#8217;d initially been  discovered in a New York nightclub as a promising prospect for a  Strokes-style rock record, Fusari recounts his work with Gaga throughout  2006 on just such a project, but says that he felt like a fish out of  water working on anything but R&amp;B. After showing Stefani an article  about how Nelly Furtado was launched back to superstardom after ditching  folk-pop for pulsating dance music, he convinced her that club beats  and performance art might actually be the way to go to achieve stardom  &#8212; despite her preference for a more stripped-down sound. &#8220;Beautiful,  Dirty, Rich&#8221; was the first dance song they recorded together, and the  song caught the attention of Interscope. Sometime in 2007, she was  introduced to RedOne, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>What to make of this? The Monster Cult dismisses Fusari out of hand  as a bitter ex-boyfriend trying to steal Gaga&#8217;s money in a frivolous  lawsuit. He may very well be bitter, and his exorbitant lawsuit strikes  me as a bit quixotic. But the kind of scenario Fusari describes is par-for-the-course in  the business, and it&#8217;s not as if Gaga&#8217;s recent actions don&#8217;t confirm his version of events: as noted, when Gaga is set loose, she prefers to pen songs like &#8220;Speechless&#8221;  &#8212; songs that are fairly close to the kind of sound she&#8217;d originally  been going for.</p>
<p>There is certainly nothing shameful about adopting a new persona. But  the hypocrisy reeks to high heavens: Lady Gaga has cast herself as the  champion of misfits, eccentrics, and weirdos, telling them to embrace  their identity, no matter what the costs; no matter what others might  say to them. But she is particularly ill-equipped for such a role, given  that <em>she herself compromised her identity to win stardom!</em> Stars like Ke$ha and Britney Spears happily admit that they wear masks  on stage for the sake of performance. Lady Gaga, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.barkbiteblog.com/2010/05/lady-gaga-channels-madonna-in-new-interview-looks-exhausted.html">defiantly insists</a> that nothing about her is an act; that her stage persona is a pristine representation of who she really is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alexander Fury: What do you think is the biggest misconception about you?</p>
<p>Lady Gaga: That I&#8217;m a character. Or that Gaga is separate from Stefani. We are one and the same, there is no difference&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Puh-leez.</em> Go watch Stefani Germanotta perform. She&#8217;s fantastic at what  she does, and she loves doing it. “Lady Gaga” is nothing but a character  played by that woman.</p>
<p><strong>The Thinnest Skin In the Business<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Given that she&#8217;s not who she claims to be, it should probably not come as a surprise that she&#8217;s got such a massive chip on her shoulder. Indeed, I have never seen a pop star as concerned as Lady Gaga about what her critics are saying about her. Never have I seen someone with such thin skin; who felt so strongly that they had something to <em>prove</em>. In addition to the above-documented statements where she (falsely) claims to write all of her own music and whines that there&#8217;s actually nothing trendy about her music, consider <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0BGlkmxVQU">this obnoxious video</a>, where, in a grating tone, she yells &#8220;Surprise! A pop show &#8212; and the bitch can sing!&#8221; And when her mic cut out one night, she felt the need to <a href="http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2010/10/19/lady_gaga_i_told_you_i_dont_lip_sync">intone</a>: &#8220;I told you I don&#8217;t lip-sync! My fucking mic just went out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, and? Virtually nobody in the industry except Britney Spears blatantly lip-syncs their way through entire concerts. Even the weaker singers &#8212; Katy Perry and Rihanna, for instance &#8212; give it their all, even when it comes up a little bit short. That Gaga feels the need to announce the fact that her vocals are live on <a href="http://popdirt.com/lady-gaga-ill-never-lip-sync/71577/">such a</a> <a href="http://amygrindhouse.com/lady-gaga-promises-to-never-lip-synch.html">repeated</a> <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,7709013,00.html">basis</a> seems evidence to me that she&#8217;s &#8212; oh, let&#8217;s just put it politely: <em>very</em> insecure. It&#8217;s absolutely baffling: she&#8217;s on top of the world &#8212; what does she care whether some anonymous critic is accusing her of lip-syncing?</p>
<p>In this sense, Gaga&#8217;s public outbursts remind me of Sarah Palin. Both women are attractive divas; both of them think they&#8217;re far more important than they actually are; both of them let their critics get to them; both of them wrongly believe themselves to be voices for their generation &#8212; and while both of them are beloved by a base of hardcore fans, it&#8217;s hard to overlook the fact that they&#8217;re both just a lil&#8217; bit nuts.</p>
<p><strong>A Horrid Role Model</strong></p>
<p>The following episode was a defining moment in the evolution of my thoughts about Lady Gaga. If we are to believe her that her Monsters are comprised primarily of misfits and lonely hearts &#8212; she notes that she has received plenty of letters from gay kids who had been kicked out of their homes, for instance &#8212; then what can we call her except foolish, irresponsible, and destructive &#8212; when she <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebritynews/news/lady-gaga-reveals-she-does-cocaine-201028">admits</a> to dabbling in cocaine?</p>
<p>She did &#8220;bags and bags&#8221; of cocaine when she was younger, she confessed, and implores her fans to not go down that road. But, well, that being said, she still admits to &#8220;occasionally&#8221; dabbling in cocaine <em>since achieving superstardom!</em> (Please try to imagine what people&#8217;s reaction would be if Britney Spears told the world that she dabbled in cocaine.)</p>
<p>Cocaine isn&#8217;t like marijuana. It is <em>not</em> a falsely-stigmatized drug that does little more than send a person into a small high for a while. Cocaine is very dangerous, and Gaga, as a self-appointed spokeswoman for vulnerable young people, has a responsibility to transmit the right message. (And for the record: &#8220;Do as I say, not as I do&#8221; ain&#8217;t that message.)</p>
<p>She might be playing with fire, here: her fans absolutely worship her. At the very best, what we&#8217;re now dealing with are thousands of people who are, at the very least, <em>apologizing for or excusing</em> her cocaine use. This is totally unacceptable. We cannot just excuse this as &#8220;Gaga being Gaga.&#8221; Despite her <a href="http://www.theprophetblog.net/self-proclaimed-super-human-lady-gaga-plans-to-change-the-world-with-new-album">claims to the contrary</a>, she is a human being &#8212; one with immense influence over a lot of young people. Her breathtaking irresponsibility here is shameful. At the very least, she could have kept her damn mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>Queen of the Gays</strong></p>
<p>For  some reason, Gaga&#8217;s Monster Cult always seems to think it has me  trapped, here. &#8220;You love Britney Spears so much,&#8221; Little Monsters say to  me. &#8220;But when&#8217;s the last time Britney Spears did anything for the gay  community?&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all, I completely reject the notion that celebrities are somehow morally required to &#8220;speak out&#8221; on political and cultural  issues. That singers are public figures is a byproduct of the widespread appeal of  their craft, not their political aptitude. If Britney Spears just wants  to perform, let her perform in peace. We don&#8217;t demand that carpenters, teachers,  or even lawyers become public advocates for political positions. Why  should we expect the same of performers?</p>
<p>Moreover, even if they&#8217;re inclined  to speak out, I believe that they should always weigh their options  prudently: celebrity activism always serves as a double-edged sword. The  headlines surrounding Gaga&#8217;s Don&#8217;t Ask Don&#8217;t Tell activism were never, for instance, &#8220;Lady Gaga speaks out for gay  rights,&#8221; but rather &#8220;<em><strong>LADY GAGA!!!!!</strong> </em>speaks out  for gay rights.&#8221; The celebrity always ends up overtaking the issue,  rendering their efforts, intentionally or not, somewhat self-indulgent.</p>
<p>Second, how utterly patronizing is it to ask me such a question in the first place? Do  Lady Gaga fans look at me and see nothing but a homosexual? Might it  have occurred to the Monster Cult that I have other considerations in  mind than my sexual orientation; that my life doesn&#8217;t revolve around the  fact that I&#8217;m gay? When Lady Gaga thanks &#8220;the gays&#8221; in her speeches, I  wonder: would anyone thank &#8220;the blacks&#8221; for their support? Would any  other minority group ever be lumped into such an undifferentiated,  stereotypical mass? I have always maintained that Lady Gaga&#8217;s affection for gay men is little more than glorified fag-haggery. She simply strikes me as someone whose first reaction to a gay friend&#8217;s  coming-out would be &#8220;Oh my gosh! I love gays! Can we go shopping?&#8221; Gay  people, to Lady Gaga, are bunch of pink, glittery, fashion-obsessed  queens. There&#8217;s not a lot of difference between Christian conservatives&#8217;  stereotypical views of gays and Lady Gaga&#8217;s: the key distinction seems  only to be that she <em>likes</em> that stereotype. It&#8217;s incredibly condescending &#8212; and it&#8217;s really a shame, given that she could be using her platform to empower young gay people to be truly individualistic, trailblazing, and self-empowered. Instead, she sends them down the path of the same-old same-old political nonsense, with a liberal dosage of trite cliches about &#8220;loving yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth is that being gay doesn&#8217;t have to be &#8220;about&#8221; anything. I think I speak for most gay people when I say that our sexual orientation is not a central part of our identity. Lady Gaga is positively obsessed with our homosexuality &#8212; and it&#8217;s condescending, not liberating.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Bullshit</strong></p>
<p>Gaga is well-known for her living her act, but it&#8217;s no accident that her meat dress is the top suggested search result on Google when one types in &#8220;Lady Gaga.&#8221; Somewhat intriguingly, though, she appears strangely self-conscious about her sensationalist tactics. In a rambling, incoherent attempt to justify the artistic merits of her meat dress, she <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/music/840850-lady-gaga-defends-meat-dress-by-claiming-shes-no-piece-of-meat#ixzz19poPgo7O">fumbled around</a> awkwardly to Ellen DeGeneres, jumping from one piece of nonsense to another, none of them connected to the other in any discernible way:</p>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;However,  it has many interpretations, but for me this evening &#8230; If we don&#8217;t  stand up for what we believe in and if we don&#8217;t fight for our rights,  pretty soon we&#8217;re going to have as much rights as the meat on our own  bones.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;What?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And I am not a piece of meat,&#8221; she added.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;Yeah, that too!</p>
</div>
<div>And, infamously, Gaga <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/08/lady-gaga-vanity-fair-drugs-sex-fans.html">declared</a> to <em>Vanity Fair</em> that she feared sex with men, lest they rob her of her creativity through her vagina. (Imagine if Taylor Swift had said this.) How much absurdist bullshit does Gaga have to spout before we finally declare her nutty, rather than merely eccentric?</div>
</div>
<p><strong>We Arrive at the Real Problem</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to dislike Lady Gaga. The  heart of the problem is not what has truly made her a star: her music is intense and  driving, her fashion sense is interesting, and much of her showboating is  entertaining and part of a long tradition of pop divas, inherited from  the likes of Cher, Madonna, and Britney Spears. And it&#8217;s mostly <em>those </em>aspects that are appealing to the public.</p>
<p>The key problem is  the utter disconnect &#8212; even discord &#8212; between perception and reality amongst her and her fans. I can always enjoy Ke$ha&#8217;s music, for instance, mindless and carefree as it is, because she never  pretends to be anything other than what she is: a pop artist who makes  fun party music. There&#8217;s little substantive difference between the topical themes of Ke$ha and Lady Gaga&#8217;s  music, but <em>Ke$ha isn&#8217;t out there pushing her work as high art.</em> Gaga and her fans present her as an avant-garde, politically-conscious   revolutionary, single-handedly bringing art, style, and sensibility back to   the pop arena. She is not doing that. Since the release of <em>The Fame Monster</em>, she has been a cancer on the pop arena, epitomizing everything that people loathe about showbiz. She is a narcissistic egomaniac running amok on the world stage, unleashing havoc on the pop world, and talking down to anyone who gets in her way.</p>
<p>I wonder what the Lady Gaga of 2008 would have to say about the Lady Gaga of 2010. <em>That</em> was the Lady Gaga I once loved: the self-knowing, humble, fun-loving Lady Gaga who I requested at the clubs, rooted for at awards shows, introduced to my friends, inspired me to take fashion risks, and saw in concert. Wherever she is, I want her back. The pop music fans who once rooted for her but just couldn&#8217;t swallow the Monster Cult bullshit are still out there. And we are eagerly awaiting her return.</p>

<p>I completely agree with flavio.  Stefani Germanotta needs to go to Tibet and meditate for a year.  She is immature and silly.  </p>
<p>And her &#8220;little monsters&#8221; may just contain some nutjob who will do a lot more harm to any cause or even a person who does not buy the garbage &#8220;Mother Monster&#8221; sells.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of Lady Gaga because of her beautiful, creative, true music she has produced and because she is not afraid to be different and dress in a manic way. Her dress sense tells the world who she is  and her little monster(like me &lt;3) how much she loves them and what she wants and how she wants people to think. There are many immature people out there like you who dislike her. I am fine with that because we are all human and we all like different things and different artists. There are lots of people who don&#039;t like Justin Beiber, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, Eminem, Beyonce, Katy Perry and many others but we should not judge them because there like something you don&#039;t. Someone out there may write a essay against Justin Beiber but his fans will protest against it despite many people who say he a bad role model, terrible singer, drug addict, stupid child but if thats the thing there love let them love it. I love Lady Gaga and to all the haters out there go on hate her because there are many other Little Monsters in the world who love her like me. Stefani Germanotta is up there with the greats who have changed things such as Michael Jackson who have brought there own creativity in there songs, fashion and the outlandish things there have said. No hate comments because I was Born This Way!!</p>

<p>I Totally Agree with you. Let them hate, as long as the Little Monsters like us love her. It&#8217;s find. They&#8217;re just haters, let them be. She was Born This Way and She ain&#8217;t gonna change!!!</p>

<p>Ah you got it down pat.<br />
I hate pretentious artists anyway, and then I gave Gaga a chance, I even brought The Fame Monster deluxe edition, and then she touted Born This Way as some kind of second coming of pop and gave me vibes of out right ripping off stuff I&#8217;ve heard many times before (Oops I Did It Again is the ULTIMATE unpretentious Be Yourself record). That and her slow metamorphosis into becoming the sort of pretentious, over done, over malisma-ed, assuming they&#8217;ll be around forever, thinking they are a legend/icon, believing their own fan-hype kind of artist I hate. I just have this weird feeling like she&#8217;ll end up being a overly long fad (Going on three years now), opposed to a pop icon or even having an over five years career is ridiculous because her image is so false and her selling point is so gimmicky and forgettable(weird clothes basically). I mean how much clothes can she take off while walking to the shops to buy a can of coke can she do before people realize how false she is? How many songs does she have to totally write and yet seem to have no actual writing style before people think? How many times does she have to &#8220;Use&#8221; the gays or the misfits basically SOLELY for their money before people realize they are being used? </p>
<p>I mean I would believe her if she was really throwing money at the problem, or did it in a way which made her message more accepting to everybody. I would love to see her opening her message to be aimed at everybody who feels depressed or everybody who feels out of touch with reality, or even everybody with mental disorders.<br />
I mean even Kesha has worked in shelters for the homeless and spent alot of time working with people who&#8217;s lifes aren&#8217;t perfect. She was a poor child growing up and she takes the time to really work for her causes, Lady Gaga who lived this gifted life, went to one of the greatest colleges, and lived in New York ffs can&#8217;t spare a little money towards a cause she supports.<br />
It looks bad to me and it looked bad to me for a while.</p>

<p>The only thing that i disagree with here is the 2008 Gaga.  She was just as dillusional and manipulative then and she is now, she just didn&#8217;t have the power then.  Her being nice to everyone was a complete act and it worked.  As someone who was active in the underground NY club world, i&#8217;ll have you know that she was completely non-existent and she lied her way to the top.  I know I don&#8217;t need to go into the &#8216;who she ripped off&#8217; diatribe because its pretty well said, but she literally took Madonna&#8217;s story and imprinted on her own.  And the concept of &#8220;The Fame&#8221;.  Look to the 2 artists she was most blatantly ripping off image wise to start, David Bowie and Grace Jones.  Both had songs called &#8220;Fame&#8221;, and Jones&#8217; second album was titled &#8220;Fame&#8221;.  And lastly, and this is what disturbs me the most, is that her mantras of 2008, &#8220;tell a lie until it becomes truth&#8221; and &#8220;art is a lie&#8221;, is pretty self explanatory and transparent as to what her agenda is.  </p>
<p>Oh wait, one more thing.  On the subject of Freedom is a Brand and shooting down other artists, i think you should add one more pop star into the discussion who happened to launch this message.  MIA via &#8220;Born Free&#8221;.</p>

<p>@muffinhead &#8212; Fair enough on the &#8217;08 Gaga part. Very well could have been an act. I&#8217;ve been giving her the benefit of the doubt in assuming that the fame simply went to her head, but perhaps there was something more methodological to it. </p>
<p>I do remember the &#8220;art is a lie&#8221; nonsense but will admit that I swept it under the rug and brushed it off as a dopey-but-excusable comment made from time to time by pop stars. It was only later that I began to realize that the pretentious, contrived bullshit was going to be central to her image.</p>

<p>You make a valid arguement. I agree with many of your points. However there are parts of your essay which are problematic.<br />
You cannot pick and choose what drugs are harmless and vilified by society. You cannot say &#8220;cocaine is bad and those who engage in using it are bad role models&#8221; but say marijuana is harmless. It&#8217;s self-contradictory.<br />
You claim that Lady Gaga should not claim to be a role model, I would have to agree. Why she feels compelled to speak for the entire world of &#8220;misits&#8221; is beyond me, that the LGBT community is inclusive in that said group is also apparently over my head. Use of language such as fag-hag is a major problem, especially when presenting an arguement about celebrity self contradiction and decadence. Being that you are gay, but don&#8217;t identify with that label (I surmise by your statement). By making such a subjective statement you are devaluing those that do.<br />
Really I don&#8217;t disagree with your claims that Gaga is a megalomaniac, basking in her own decadent brand of narcissism. A brand of narcissism so many artists and celebrities have sold before; much like her music is plagerised, so is her persona and entire cultural relevance. She&#8217;s Madonna part 2; Madonna was Cher part 2, so on and so forth. Gaga however is blatant in her &#8220;borrowing.&#8221; All one needs to do is listen to &#8220;Born This Way&#8221; in that it is &#8220;express yourself&#8221; with new lyrics. People eat it up and Stefani (ironically even her given name recalls another singer) is laughing all the way to the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madonna was Cher part 2, so on and so forth&#8221;</p>
<p>They hardly have anything alike.  Very strange comparison.</p>

<p>omg this essay? is so crippy<br />
you think britney is bigger than lady gaga?<br />
Never and ever<br />
Can britney even sing live?? she can&#8217;t even dance now<br />
Can Britney write a song? No SHE CAN&#8217;T<br />
Britney can win nothing when she battles with gaga<br />
I don&#8217;t hate britney but your shit makes me hate britney<br />
She won 1 award from grammy while lady gaga won 2 award in 2years and she will get another awards in 2011grammy<br />
Album sales?? Britney&#8217;s company use the strategy to sell more albums. that&#8217;s why britney&#8217;s single sales are low.<br />
and now everyone downloads songs so lady gaga&#8217;s the fame which sold 13million means much more britney&#8217;s babyonemoretime which sold 25million.<br />
And now britney&#8217;s circus sold like what? 3million??<br />
hahaha<br />
Ladygaga&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;britney spears!!</p>

<p>Yes Britney is bigger than Gaga. Since 1998, she broke A LOT of records (just surf the Internet for a while and you&#8217;ll see).<br />
Britney CAN sing live (go on YouTube to see what I&#8217;m talking about).<br />
Britney can write a song (Dear Diary, Let Go, Little Me for example).<br />
You&#8217;re too stupid to realize that the Grammys are fake (oh just like Lady Caca btw), labels sign contracts with the Grammys FYI.<br />
&#8220;and now everyone downloads songs so lady gaga’s the fame which sold 13million means much more britney’s babyonemoretime which sold 25million.&#8221; You&#8217;re aware this sentence doesn&#8217;t make any sense right?<br />
Britney sold more than 100 million albums in 10 years (confirmed by the RIAA).<br />
Circus sold 3 million because of a lack of promo but she was recovering from a huge depression remember??</p>
<p>In a nutshell, all of your troll arguments are INVALID.</p>

<p>But did you know that when lady gaga worked at interscope records, she wrote the song circus? She also wrote songs for the pussy cat dolls and akon&#8230; So circus&#8230; Definitely not Britney. But gaga:)</p>

<p>So &#8230; basically, your taste in art and music is based off how successful someone is rather than the art or music itself? And let me guess, only one pop star can be successful at any given time, kinda like how only one person can lead and receive praise in a dictatorship (a la Hitler)? Oddly, I&#8217;m not a fan of either Britney or GaGa, but GaGa&#8217;s genuine talent does not justify her manipulative, totalitarian bullshit. Stop bashing people for thinking differently. Diversity is a good thing.</p>

<p>Jason C., let me answer your &#8220;freaking stupid reply.&#8221;  Britney can sing live.  Did you do as Karine suggested and go to YouTube to find the proof?  I&#8217;m sure you didn&#8217;t because you want to stay pressed and delusional.</p>
<p>Your lack of knowledge about anything Britney Spears related is quite obvious from your insistence that she performed &#8220;Everytime&#8221; on the X-Factor.  She never performed that song on that show.  She did, however, perform &#8220;Womanizer&#8221; and I believe it was only her 3rd stage performance since her breakdown.</p>
<p>You say &#8220;Everytime&#8221; was &#8220;hell terrible.&#8221;  From Wikipedia:<br />
&#8220;&#8221;Everytime&#8221; was <b>positively received by critics, who complimented its simple lyrics and the organic feel of the song in comparison with most of the tracks of In the Zone</b>. &#8220;Everytime&#8221; was a <b>big success, peaking inside the top five in most countries, while reaching the top of the charts in Australia, Hungary, Ireland and the United Kingdom.</b> Spears performed &#8220;Everytime&#8221; in a series of live appearances and in two of her concert tours: on piano in a flowered-themed setting at The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004) and while suspended on a giant umbrella at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009). &#8220;Everytime&#8221; has been covered by artists such as Glen Hansard and Jackie Evancho.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it was so &#8220;hell terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Circus&#8221; sales did suffer because of a lack of promo.  After initial performances in Europe and Good Morning America, she never appeared on another show.  Aside from her music videos and her tour (which was one of the top grossing tours that year), there was no promo.  Still, the album debuted at #1 (something 5 of Britney&#8217;s albums have done and thus far NONE of Gaga&#8217;s) and featured two Top 10 singles.  There is no other artist in pop music aside from an icon like Madonna who could release an album with such little promo and do so well.</p>
<p>The Grammy&#8217;s have awarded Britney.  However, winning a Grammy Award doesn&#8217;t necessarily signify some sort of artistic merit that non-winners just don&#8217;t have.  Milli Vanilli won a Grammy for a song they didn&#8217;t even sing the vocals on.  I&#8217;ll also mention that it took Madonna a lot of years to even win her first Grammy.</p>
<p>How stupid Gaga&#8217;s cult is&#8230;</p>

<p>Someone&#8217;s a complete dumbass, I see.</p>
<p>Using the &#8220;You&#8217;re just jealous!&#8221; argument makes you look like a half-brained twit with an IQ of -7.</p>

<p>Please exit the puberty library and return its overdue catchwords.  Boredom with someone and jealousy of them are not the same thing.</p>
<p>And the word I believe you were looking for is &#8220;envy&#8221;.  Google it sometime.  Your idol Gaga seethes with it.</p>

<p>Actually I think Britney can write her own songs but her label won&#8217;t release them, not because they aren&#8217;t good but because they want to control her image. There is nothing wrong with not writing your own songs anyway. Britney has taken Michael Jackson&#8217;s place in the fame game. I have a lot of respect for her. She has an enormous amount of pressure on her shoulders.<br />
And remember without a britney there could have been no gaga!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so glad that you took the time to express your feelings on Lady Gaga. I agree with you and have a few friends that do too. I love how you articulated everything and backed it up with facts. Thanks so much!</p>

<p>Some people look deeper than &#8220;not like a band&#8221;.  What&#8217;s going on here is on a different level.</p>
<p>People like you are like brainfarts, farting in the wind without looking at how it has affected, say, culture.</p>
<p>Brainfart on, I suppose</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but you really need to find an effective hobby.  You are, as clearly shown, a Britney Spears fan.  You criticize Gaga, yet your favorite artist neither writes her songs, plays an instrument nor sing live.  </p>
<p>You need a life.  Truly.  If Little Monsters look up to Gaga and enjoy her, so what?  How is that bothering you? </p>
<p>This is just unnecessary.</p>

<p>Actually Britney can play piano and has been seen doing so on many occasions even while yes on stage singing live, what Britney does and does not do is not even factor into his essay,  and you are clearly using a straw man argument. </p>
<p>Never once does he say &#8216;Britney writes her own music&#8217; His obvious problem is that Lady Gaga CLAIMS that she is the sole person writing and producing her music, something that if you would simply look through the album art that comes with your CD you would see is in fact false. It seems to me that he has no problem with performers who do not write and produce their own music. His problem stems from Lady Gaga LYING about it. Britney however makes no such claims to generate &#8216;artistic integrity&#8217; it reminds me of the scandal Beyonce had with &#8216;If I Were A Boy&#8217;, this is a problem in the music industry people CLAIMING to do more than they actually do.</p>
<p>And to close&#8230;honestly reading comprehension is your friend.</p>

<p>Exactly. I have no problem with artists who don&#8217;t write their own music. After all, what would songwriters who can&#8217;t sing do if there weren&#8217;t singers who can&#8217;t songwrite? My problem with Gaga, as you correctly stated, is that she&#8217;s a liar &#8212; and she&#8217;s shunning some very talented people&#8217;s work. Gaga ignoring RedOne&#8217;s role is so ridiculous &#8212; it&#8217;s as if Britney were to ignore Max Martin, or Bloodshy and Avant.</p>

<p>She does write her own songs but she is not a liar.. Gaga isn&#8217;t ignoring RedOne&#8217;s role, what do you think she&#8217;s a dj who produces her own music? Yes, she produces her own music but she produces it with the help of her producers.. You don&#8217;t watch her videos when she accepts her awards, she thanks her producers, and her inspirations..</p>

<p>The thing everybody is seein&#8217; now is that she&#8217;s fake, up until she got her contract she wasn&#8217;t Gaga.<br />
She was a normal soulful jazz chick, who had a normal life and wore pants to go the shops.<br />
Then she changed into this Gaga figment of her imagination, who is not who she really is and who she wasn&#8217;t Born to be.</p>

<p>Back in 2008 when i first saw the Poker Face video i thought to myself: &#8220;What a beautiful chick! Love her hair!&#8221; And a couple of months later I heard that she calls herself ugly and supports all kinds of misdfits. This is just so strange to me. In fact, Lady Gaga used to be a beautiful female and now she has created herself into a true monster. So she is nothing more than she makes of herself. And I don&#8217;t understand why a woman would like to look ugly (except, maybe, for sales?).</p>
<p>My problem with Gaga and her FANS,too, is that they constantly attack other artists for ripping her ideas. But in fact, many of those ideas existed way before Gaga. Soon they will say that breathing and eating were her ieas, too. Poor Christina and Britney have to take in so much stupid things. Gaga now starts attacking people for not being able to sing? Is she the greatest voice in this  generation of singers? HELL NO! I&#8217;ve never heard her hit difficult notes. And YES Britney can sing. Just look up her child records. I wish she used her voice more. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong though. I like most of Gaga&#8217;s songs and listen to them frequently. But what I hate about her is her arrogant ATTITUDE! So thanks for this site, because more people have to know who GAGA really is&#8230; or what she really is.</p>

<p>Wow. I&#8217;m shocked. I finally  found someone who agrees with me regarding Lady Gaga and that she indeed has changed since her debut. Shame. I miss the 2008-Gaga, and I can&#8217;t even call it the &#8220;old Gaga&#8221;.</p>

<p>Exactly. I have no problem with artists who don’t write their own music. After all, what would songwriters who can’t sing do if there weren’t singers who can’t songwrite? My problem with Gaga, as you correctly stated, is that she’s a liar — and she’s shunning some very talented people’s work. Gaga ignoring RedOne’s role is so ridiculous — it’s as if Britney were to ignore Max Martin, or Bloodshy and Avant.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_(Britney_Spears_album)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_(Britney_Spears_album)</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s because if Britney were to ignore them, all her songs essentially would have been produced by magic, with the exception of course with the horrid song entitled &#8220;My Baby&#8221;. Nice try little one.<br />
Clearly you don&#8217;t have much to do considering as you have created this entirely ridiculous essay about Lady Gaga. Oh please do go on stating how &#8220;Get a life&#8221; is so generic. Clearly you know it&#8217;s right. Do you even have a job? I highly doubt you do because you wouldn&#8217;t have all this time to spout off about your hatred towards an artist who clearly doesn&#8217;t give a crap about your existance. I truly grow so tired about Britney fans trying to bash GaGa while they successfully take down themselves.<br />
Let me see, you seem to bring up elections a lot so here&#8217;s one for size. In 2004 George W. Bush was running for reelection, his opponent John Kerry was a democrat, and was highly favored to win, according to polls (including exit polls). Low and behold, when all the votes were counted, who won? Oh yes, George W. Bush. Which shocked many new channels and individuals around the country. So what am I saying? Don&#8217;t always believe that who you think will do better is the clear victory according to hearsay, you may just find yourself up a stream without a paddle.</p>

<p>Ah !! Good Ol L&#8217;il Monsters! You have zeroed in on the least consequential part of this outstanding essay. He isn&#8217;t even defending Britney for god&#8217;s sake! He&#8217;s just creating an analogy between two artists.And the fact that you asked a vile and grossly impudent question whether he has a job just shows that you&#8217;re an ass who has been blinded and hypnotized by&#8221;Mother Monster&#8217;s&#8221; antics.<br />
How does it matter whether he has a job or not. You&#8217;re delusional and if you expect the blog writer to get into a nonsensical fight with you.<br />
Alex, this blog is amazing. Your articles are subtly vitriolic and deliciously fun to read.<br />
Keep writing and don&#8217;t reply to &#8216;meat heads&#8217;(Pun Intended) like these.</p>

<p>I might be late for this party but a lot of people have something called &#8220;free time&#8221; and using a fraction of that time to address something that has bothered you in an elaborated and resourceful way is not wasted at all.</p>

<p>Nice to see an article written about Gaga&#8217;s faults that doesn&#8217;t resort to bashing her. I quite liked Gaga to start with &amp; still enjoy her music, but the exhibitionism &amp; her deluded hateful fans are what has turned me off. You bring up some really great points here. Well done!</p>

<p>I also hate about her fans is how they make crazy jumps in logic like She Knows Piano = Her Singing Voice is Soulful&#8230;even when most of her work on The Fame was in the same key and sung in the same way and rather annoying after a long time.<br />
I mean I&#8217;m not saying she never sung in that voice and she does have her momants of beautiful soulfulness, but honestly, her voice isn&#8217;t that emotional and sweet or strong and powerful like Christina, her singing voice in her pop music isn&#8217;t that special or unique. It&#8217;s rather clumpy and flat and annoying to listen too. </p>
<p>and these bitchs tell me Britney can&#8217;t sing when she can turn any key into any emotion and really feel it and be soulful and be delicate and subtle with her vocal technique and style. She can also be fake vain and sexual and sensual and pissed off and many other emotions with her voice which Gaga simply can not do. </p>
<p>Elitist brands of monsters really really need to read Britneyology In Depth and get in touch with reality..or die trying.</p>

<p>Oh my&#8230;i love you for putting this out there because i too started out the same way. around the fame era i thought wow this is really cool club music that i can dance to. then the fame monster came and she completely changed. she started speaking very arrogant in her interviews, subtley insulting other artists besides her. she gets along with older artists obviously because those are the ones that influenced her in the beginning and she knows that if she were to talk down about them she would probably anger so many people. I&#8217;m so glad to have found this, I was beginning to feel strange somewhat. me being gay and not venerating her like the rest of the foolish gay community draws murderous stares from them. seriously, thank you.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think all this pitting pop stars up against one another is slightly more annoying than Lady Gaga hopping on the acceptance bandwagon. Some of this was actually making sense&#8230;.until a paragraph ends in a comparison between her and B-Spears or Ke$ha. I can&#8217;t see how people can put a vocalist against a musician/vocalist. It really don&#8217;t make much sense to me. Especially with so much digital work done to EVERYONE&#8217;s voices nowadays&#8230;especially artists like Spears and Kesha. All I HEAR is auto-tune&#8230;I&#8217;d like to hear an acoustic cover of one of THEIR songs. I have no problems with Gaga reiterating that she can and actually DOES sing.</p>
<p>However, this article is very interesting&#8230;I feel as if I&#8217;m not supposed to like Lady Gaga so much anymore, because I&#8217;m not gay? It&#8217;s as if I can&#8217;t enjoy her music to the extent of her other fans. Like I&#8217;m not&#8230;allowed. It&#8217;s a shame, because what I loved about Lady Gaga was her piano playing. When she was previewing &#8220;You and I&#8221; forever ago, I was way more excited for her new album, because it&#8217;s that old school rock ballad nitty-gritty ivory pounding that I wanted from her so much. Unfortunately, she got side-tracked on the quest for monster equality or whatever.</p>
<p>Lastly, you&#8217;re absolutely right. Lady Gaga is a series of contradictions. Nevertheless, I can excuse this. She&#8217;s an artist. A flaky musician that, at times, totally changes their direction. Isn&#8217;t that the way it works? One day you&#8217;re inspired by one concept, the next day, another. It&#8217;s just the way some people operate. Yes, it&#8217;s unintelligent. Yes, it&#8217;s hypocritical. But it&#8217;s also the way things are, especially in the world of creative arts. I&#8217;m not trying to justify the things she says, but it&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s the first musician to change her fundamentals a bit. Look at Bowie&#8230;.go from codpieces one day to thin white duke the next. Morals change. Look at Jonathan Davis of Korn. All I&#8217;m trying to say is that if we hung on other artists&#8217; words as much as we do Lady Gaga, who is the MOST over-analyzed person in the world right now (as displayed by this well-written but completely pointless essay), we&#8217;d find lots of contradictions. I just don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s the only artist in the world guilty of this. I think there have been worse, but it&#8217;s this immense spotlight on Gaga that makes us focus on her as if she&#8217;s the only one with her foot in her mouth.</p>

<p>Hold It Against Me has 2.5 seconds of auto tune.<br />
So yeah. Britney Spears = Auto Tune, try again!</p>
<p>Kesha owns the Vocoder though. She should make her own. I would so buy it! (and I love her)</p>

<p>also, on your point about how shes mad other people are promoting individuality, she said this in an interview:<br />
&#8220;Perhaps we can make women&#8217;s rights trendy. Make women&#8217;s rights, feminism, strength, security, the wisdom of the woman, let&#8217; make that trendy.&#8221;</p>
<p>f u lady gaga. I wasn&#8217;t aware laying ass-naked and spreading your legs to two men in the love game video was doing shit for they way women are percieved in the media/music.<br />
also, way to pick and choose whats trendy or not. funny how she always thinks shes like the pioneer/speaker for all these things, but she NEVER addresses them in music videos. she lieks to talk about them in a psuedo-intellectual manner but hardly does shit to make it seem she actually cares.</p>

<p>you&#8217;re a bad person. i don&#8217;t even like lady gaga, but what you&#8217;re doing here is cruel. i&#8217;d like to see how you&#8217;d react to having an entire wordpress bashing &amp; dissing you; don&#8217;t say you&#8217;d love it &amp; the attention.. &#8217;cause i know you&#8217;d be upset. &amp; don&#8217;t say that &#8220;when people put themselves out there, it is inevitable that people will diss them&#8230;, etc.&#8221; because you don&#8217;t have to. i don&#8217;t understand the ignorance &amp; desperation for self-validation your harbor. leave the poor girl alone. she&#8217;s not a bad person. she&#8217;s not creating negativity.. just like britney spears isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>rolls eyes at the comment above. Darling, are you familiar with the saying: if you can&#8217;t take the heat of the kitchen, then get out. I&#8217;m sure Caca is well aware of this, without your help.</p>
<p>I guess if you don&#8217;t like people saying negative things about certain topics, you should go to North Korea where self expression is prohibited. </p>
<p>And also, how is it right for you to say negative remarks about the author vis-a-vis the author saying negative remarks about Gaga? It&#8217;s the same thing.</p>
<p>Darling, if you can&#8217;t take writings like these, then don&#8217;t read it. You do have free will don&#8217;t you? Or maybe you do live in North Korea.</p>
<p>Whatever. Too much time wasted on you.</p>

<p>I have nothing against Lady Gaga, but I have no idea why she is seen by the media as the only true Artist out there, when there are lesser known Artists such as Emilie Autumn. The secret behind Gaga&#8217;s success is probably how simply HYPNOTIZING she is. Seriously, I&#8217;m not even joking. Even her haters are completely obsessed with her. Everything she says, everything she does, everything she wears, her Music, her speeches&#8230;it all just sucks you in. It&#8217;s like she has this ability to put people under some sort of spell. I was looking up her darker The Fame Monster photoshoots the other day and she&#8217;s&#8230;she&#8217;s CREEPY. She honestly looks like a demon in some of her pictures. There is seriously something so screwed up about that girl. Still, I guess that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s so thrilling to watch. She&#8217;s like a mirror into a disorted world. Everything about her is just so confusing. Even Monstrous at times.</p>

<p>Plague Rat is totally what I think.<br />
Emilie Autumn has a  message, a couple of message really and they show in her music, her stage show, her clothes, the way she is, what era she decided to dress from and her monologues.<br />
Lady Gaga is a poor mans Emilie Autumn</p>

<p>I originally came to this site thinking I&#8217;d get some interesting insight in to why people might have some legitimate gripes about Lady Gaga.  But really&#8230; this site is crap.  Her appearances on 60 minutes and Leno have blown all of your ridiculous claims to waste.  Her sincerity is a breath of fresh air compared to your silly ridicule.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to add something about calling her fans &#8220;little monsters&#8221;. What this woman is basically doing on a psychological, subconscious level is debasing her fans. She is referring to them as THINGS. A monster is an imaginary, mythological CREATURE. Something not human and that is INCAPABLE of thinking for itself. Monsters in stories are always depicted as mindless drones filled with rage and animal behavior. Take Frankenstein for example. Not only is she referring to them as something not human, but she adds the word little in front of it to debase them even more so. It is actually quite sickening on many levels. She also refers to herself as &#8220;Mother Monster&#8221; placing herself in a parental role to her &#8220;fans&#8221;. There are so many things wrong with this chick on so many levels it&#8217;s not even funny. From the mixed messages she sends, to her outright contradictory nature. She doesn&#8217;t know her ass from her elbow. And this person is supposed to be an advocate for Gay Rights? If I were a Gay person I would be so offended by this self professed &#8220;Queen of the Gays&#8221;. She has no right speaking on behalf of the LGBT Community at all. She is a spoiled little rich girl who grew up wearing Juicy Couture and carrying around Fendi purses who all of the sudden decided one day to play dress up like a freak and screw with people&#8217;s minds. It&#8217;s not funny! When people finally wise up and see past the veneer of this shallow, vapid Media Whore and her fame wanes and then she finally implodes&#8230;it is not going to be a pretty sight. When she falls she&#8217;s going to fall hard. Mark my words!</p>

<p>Why do Britney Spears/Katy Perry/Ke$ha fans/Gaga haters always complain about how creepy it is when Gaga&#8217;s fans call her Mother Monster, and yet they fail to realize that calling their idol &#8221;God-insert end of Artist&#8217;s name here-&#8221; is just as creepy? In my opinion, &#8221;Godney&#8221; or &#8221;Ke$hus Christ&#8221; sounds a lot more obsessive and religious-minded than Mother Monster.</p>

<p>She calls us that because it&#8217;s weird and different. But, either way we like it, so we allow her to call us that. It&#8217;s really our choice. Oh, and by the way, you&#8217;re the actual attention whore. You post these horrible comments to get attention. She doesn&#8217;t call herself &#8220;Queen of the Gays&#8221; they call her that. Learn you&#8217;re facts retard.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re the actual retard. You don&#8217;t realize who she really is, just like many other people. We &#8220;little monsters&#8221; see her in a different light, unlike you haters.

<p>What you say about Gaga is also true of rappers. They call themselves &#8220;hip hop artists,&#8221; but what kind of art is speaking in a monotone, in butchered grammar, (double and sometimes triple negatives) about sex, drugs, and violence? The black rappers love using the n-word, which is supposed to be a slur, but they are proud of using it! (Eminem swears, but he doesn&#8217;t use the word) Unfortunately children love them, and they even appear in children&#8217;s shows! Please save me from wicked rapperdom! On another note, I hope Britney didn&#8217;t create the horrible &#8220;Godney&#8221; phenomenon!</p>

<p>If you came from an urban community rampant with poverty, shootings, break-ins etc Rap would have a very different meaning to you. I am not saying alot of the Modern stuff isn&#8217;t crap. In fact Kanye is the Gaga of the Rap World and is just pop music wrapped in a rap flavored candy shell. Good rap though is either uplifiting or speaks to problems with the community. Ice-T&#8217;s cop killer for example it wasn&#8217;t promoting the death of cops it was meant as a warning about the climate within LA at the time. How the constant raids were causing more and more angst within the community. That it was no longer just the gangbangers that hated the cops but the regular community feared them as well. And surley enough shortly after that song you had the Rodney KIng riots. Why because people didn&#8217;t take the time to actually listen.</p>
<p>As for them appearing in Kids shows. So what a rapper who may or may not actually be a banger/former banger can&#8217;t make something his kids can enjoy/ be proud of? He has to be hard all the time? The butchered grammar originaly began because of a failing school system within low income neighborhoods. That doesn&#8217;t account again for people like Drake, Kanye etc using it as they were properly educated for them it is just a fad but people like Snoop (even though I haven&#8217;t dug his music for years) Cube, Easy-E and the likes actually had a very paltry education and quite honestly probaly didn&#8217;t even learn to read at a post sixth grade level until they were well in their 30&#8242;s (Easy-E probaly never even got the chance)</p>
<p>Not to mention quite a few rappers especialy the &#8220;hard&#8221; up ones spend lots of time helping their old communities without any need or want to publicize it.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s not manufactured or fake, and definetely not by her label. She has simply, like many Artists before her, created an alter ego, a character, which only comes out in her Music videos, songwriting, etc. Stefani Germanotta is, as you said, the jazz ballad singer, performing rock n&#8217; roll in clubs each night, the normal, down-to-earth Girl. Note I said Girl. Lady Gaga is the glamorous, expensive, wild, fierce *Woman* who is certainly not normal at all.<br />
If you&#8217;ve seen the film Black Swan yet, you might have seen some similarities between the main character, Nina, and Stefani Germanotta. Nina is very innocent and sheltered, while the Black Swan she turns into is sexual and very much like Lady Gaga. Stefani Germanotta is Nina, the little girl. Lady Gaga is the Black Swan.</p>

<p>I totally agree about the alter ego thing. What I&#8217;ve noticed is, if &#8221;Lady Gaga&#8221; is an alter ego created by Stefani Germanotta, she may be an Assassin or a psychotic avenger of some sort. Look at her Music videos. Paparazzi, Bad Romance and Telephone are all about murder. In Bad Romance she burns the Man who bought her as a slave, in Paparazzi she poisons her boyfriend who used her for Fame, and in Telephone she basically kills an entire group of people. That&#8217;s not the only evidence I have to back it up- look at her outfits. They are all completely different and unrecognizable from eachother. Most of them consist of heavily covering clothes and accessories like sunglasses, gloves, hats and masks. Lady Gaga looks like a completely different person in every one of them, with the heavy and equally varying makeup. And what is the purpose of all this stuff? To hide her identity.</p>

<p>Oooh how I can&#8217;t wait to use this knowledge around the Net from time to time!</p>
<p>And that thing about &#8220;fag-haggery&#8221; disguised as spreading pro-gay agenda; check some &#8220;Till the World Ends&#8221; vids. Astonishing what very little these LG fans understand.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m blown away by this essay. Apart from the fact that it&#8217;s well written and well structured, it helped me articulate some of the things I don&#8217;t like about Lady Gaga. It can be very difficult to put into words exactly what it is about her that annoys, unsettles or offends you, but I think you&#8217;ve done it pretty brilliantly here.</p>

<p>I hate how people say &#8220;I miss the old Lady Gaga!&#8221; and things like that.<br />
If she had the same persona, everyone would be bored with her and she wouldn’t have lasted this long. She didn’t change, she evolved, and she’s still the same from Just Dance to Born This Way.</p>

<p>lady gaga today makes me sad. she used to write heart breaking songs like Wonderful, Again and Second Time Around. Whatever happened to her, i do not like it. She is a pop star who actually have great pop tunes but just for the sake of being &#8220;different&#8221; drops big words like government, Judas and other politically and religiously inclined words and images. theye are shocking but as time goes by, its sickening because she sometimes deliver promises about her music that are not true.</p>
<p>Unlike Britney: she said she was releasing a dance album and she did. That&#8217;s it, a promise fulfilled and we are grateful;)</p>

<p>All artists have hardcore fans. Little monsters are just like fans of other very famous artists. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a cult. They just follow Gaga whatever she does, but like every fanbase they ususally have her own reasons for that. Some follow her mainly for her Music while others like her personality or views and look up to her.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if she can change the world. But everyone should embrace it if she can change things in a good way. If you just watch one episode of a reality TV show, you will see people hating on each other, people stabbing each other back, people playing games to take advantages and riping off each other, people bullying to harm each other, people overly showing their greed for materials and money. That reflects what really happens in today&#8217;s societies. It is getting worse generation after generation. People are not themselves anymore.</p>
<p>So far she is sending messages to people, mainly to the young generation, that ARE good for them. I have seen everywhere, on youtube, yahoo answers and in RL, that more, a LOT more people are attacking and hating on Gaga than Gaga or her fans hating on other people. May be her messages are working because it seems to me that her fans are trying to love themselves more and probably feel no need to hate or attack on other people anymore. They just defend Gaga when she is attacked. I think that videos like this, accusing Lady Gaga or the &#8220;Illuminati&#8221; brainwashing society just shows ignorance. To the outside world, outside your delusional picture box, you are the ones being brainwashed. Step back into Freedom and join the Humans again, instead of being the Church&#8217;s puppet.</p>

<p>BTW has been 6 weeks at number one and you cry&#8230;.maybe you can write another essay about that&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>in all seriousness, can you just be happy for Britney&#8217;s success. shes been 13 year in the business and i dont know how, because the only thing this girl had besides beauty was her dancing ability. its a miracle shes been in the music industry for so long. lets see how she fares with her wanning beauty, and her now inability to actually dance&#8230;</p>

<p>Hi Alex. I&#8217;m a huge Gaga fan. I just wanted to share my opinion:</p>
<p>I know her [short] career. And I can say one thing: she didn&#8217;t become arrogant. The only thing that changed since 2008, is her fame and her power. U said u like Gaga but u don&#8217;t like the fact she became arrogant. I&#8217;m sorry but even if Gaga claimed that she writes and co-produces all her music (which is true), she never DENY the members of the Haus. Ever. She thanked Red one (and not only him, that&#8217;s an example. watch the grammy&#8217;s acceptance speech). She thanks the Haus so often when it comes to fashion too. She&#8217;s very a very grateful woman. And I think it&#8217;s too bad that so many people don&#8217;t see that. She&#8217;s grateful when it comes to her friends (redone, fashion designers&#8230;), her inspirations, her fans. However, I&#8217;m gonna deny the fact she has more power than before. But I think she simply evolved. When ur visions of life, of the world change, does it make u feel like a liar? I don&#8217;t think so. I know that u get ur own opinion about her personality. But I&#8217;m pretty sure she&#8217;s not a liar. That&#8217;s not her fault if she&#8217;s being herself and people don&#8217;t believe her, that&#8217;s not her problem u know. but it&#8217;s not because the 2008 Lady Gaga has evolved, that she died. She still is the same girl, she evolved, as an artist and I think she also grow up. Yeah, she&#8217;s confident in her work and sometimes when people ask her to talk about herself, it can sound as arrogance. But when she talks about her work, about the fact she created her music on her piano, and writes her lyrics in her tour bus, it don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s arrogant. When she said she thinks she&#8217;s ONE of the best voice/song writer in the industry today, yeah it sounds arrogant, but that&#8217;s the truth. She&#8217;s telling the truth. She never thought she was better than anyone else, she&#8217;s always thankful for what her inspirations brought to her in the past (Madonna, Bowie, Britney and many other people). I&#8217;m sorry if I talk too much. But I think that u shouldn&#8217;t take that too seriously. Gaga is a nice person, she proved it so many times. She loves music, she loves art, she knows where she&#8217;s going, she&#8217;s confident and strong. But she gave/gives credit to her friends (producers..). She loves her fans, she&#8217;s thankful everyday for what she has. She&#8217;s passioned with art and music since she&#8217;s a little girl. and she&#8217;s extremely cultured. she knows what she talks about. yeah she became famous as Lady Gaga, a new female singer. she gained fans, she&#8217;s been recognized but so many wonderful and legendary people (I&#8217;m not gonna tell u who, u should know (:), needed to show what she got. the 2011 lady gaga is the same. now, she just has a powerful voice for people who see her as a model(without being blind, like me). that&#8217;s what u got when u get successful: fans. she&#8217;s trying to make people, who need it, feel better. she unconsciously helps people. She doesn&#8217;t want to be the Goddess, THE hero or whatever how her fans call her. She&#8217;s here for music and art, for what she stands for. For a vast majority of her fans, Gaga is their Queen. And there&#8217;s nothing wrong about that. But she never said: I&#8217;m the queen, I&#8217;m the best, I&#8217;m the number one, fuck u all&#8217;. When she says that she doesn&#8217;t want her fans to waste their money, watching a blond bitch lipsynching on stage. Who is she talking about? the answer is quite simple: herself. u know why? she&#8217;s defending herself, as a blond, as a bitch (yeah she calls herself a bitch), as a singer. By the past, people thought she didn&#8217;t deserve to be here because she wasn&#8217;t beautiful enough, because they thought she has any talent. She even defended other women in the industry: &#8216;I think people have learned to expect very little from us [female singers]&#8216;. and she&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m not saying she&#8217;s perfect. I love her deeply. But for me, it&#8217;s not arrogance. It&#8217;s self-confidence. And she does care about her fans, gay or not. Yeah she stands for gay rights, but all her life is not around it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to change ur mind, I&#8217;m just writing facts. Bye x</p>

<p>I always thought it was very strange that so many people put Gaga on a pedestal and bash Kesha when they&#8217;re basically the same talentwise. I feel like Gaga will be like Ja Rule-really big for a few years and then dissappear into oblivion.</p>

<p>So. A bland, shy little rich girl has piano and music lesson from the age of 4. She grows up painfully aware of her boringness.<br />
She then tries to break into the club circuit, singing covers of rock songs in her weak nasally voice, but doesn&#8217;t get very far, because she&#8217;s crap.<br />
She then meets/shags Rob Fusari who invests a year of his time working with her, and by her great fortune, she also meets RedOne. If it wasn&#8217;t for these last two facts I guarantee you she would still be living off her rich daddy wishing she was more interesting.<br />
And I&#8217;ve not even started on the drugs/stripper/bisexual lies.</p>

<p>Since you said she&#8217;s crap, you&#8217;re crap. And besides, I bet she went farther than you ever did. You&#8217;re just jealous. So, if you don&#8217;t have anything nice to say just shut up.</p>

<p>Gaga was a stripper. There were photos of her grinding on a pole with next to no clothes leaked a while back. And people around Gaga have comfirmed that she has a raging drugs problem.</p>

<p>If somebody says to me one more time that this bitch is the &#8220;new&#8221; fucking Madonna, I will go postal. She is not, nor will she EVER be on the same level as Madonna. She is not even the poor man&#8217;s Madonna. We&#8217;ll leave that title for Britney Spears. Even though I like Britney Spears she&#8217;s still no Madonna. </p>
<p>Stefani Germanotta is a second rate Cyndi Lauper at best. Actually, that&#8217;s even too good, and I don&#8217;t even like Cyndi Lauper. I am so over this gargoyle in a dress with weird shoes it&#8217;s not even funny. She is BORING, contrived and SOOOOOOOO OVERRATED it&#8217;s not even funny anymore. </p>
<p>I just heard that new song Judas unfortunately. It&#8217;s a train wreck! It is basically a rehash of Poker Face and Bad Romance all sped up. Everyone touts what a GENIUS this thing is and how talented she is. Really, because she can play the piano and look like a clown? Uh, people, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani can play the piano as well and Madonna plays the guitar WHILE DANCING, but nobody goes around calling them musical geniuses. I give Madonna a lot of credit for going outside of her comfort zone and learning to play the guitar at such a late age. It shows she&#8217;s willing to really evolve as an artist and take risks regarding what people knew her as. </p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s get back to the Stefani germanotta playing the piano thing. People say&#8230;Oh, she&#8217;s so creative and brilliant with her piano playing. Why, because she lights the damn thing on fire and jumps around like a fool? Jerry Lee Lewis was doing that shit eons a go. I can just imagine Stefani Germanotta sitting there as a kid watching Great Balls Of Fire and saying&#8230;I&#8217;m going to do that, because it&#8217;s edgy. There is nothing edgy or creative about this woman at all. She is nothing more than a dust bowl of all other pop stars who have come before her. She has ripped off Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, Gwen Stafani, Christina Aguilera, Pink, Grace Jones, Rosyn Murphy, Robyn, Gopldfrapp, Debbie Harry, Dale Bozio from Missing Persons, Madonna and even Jeffree fucking Star.</p>
<p>She is a hack! I can not wait until these &#8220;litle monsters&#8221; finally wakeup and see through the veneer and see what a fake this chick is.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even describe how much I despise this woman and her pandering to gays and lesbians. Calling herself the Queen Of The Gays? Are you fucking kidding me? I am not gay, but if I were, I would find it insulting that a 25 year old chick with no experience in the real world would have the audacity to speak on my behalf or my community that has suffered the injustices of the world just because of their sexual orientation. Here is a woman telling people it&#8217;s okay to be who you are. Really? Oh thank you Lady GaGa, girl with an internet millionaire for a father, and graduate of Tisch University for validating me and my homosexuality with your words of wisdom. Now FUCK YOU, BITCH!</p>
<p>A 25 year old woman who plays dress up and changed her name to Lady GaGa and wears wigs like a clown and outfits fit for a circus and more makeup than any drag performer I have ever seen is telling the world, specifically gays and lesbians, to be &#8220;themselves&#8221;? LMFAO! The absurdity of this is beyond measure! It is so ridiculous it could be a bad movie. </p>
<p>On a positive note, however, this is show business, and the girl is obviously giving some people what they want. There is obviously an audience for everything and everyone as she has proved. No matter how god awful or contrived it may be.</p>

<p>Are you retarded, or what? Britney Spears is the one biting off of her! She started copying her with the way she dresses! You obviously don&#8217;t look at what&#8217;s around you. You say she&#8217;s rips stuff off of other artists, but, isn&#8217;t that what other artists do? I mean, they get their inspiration from somewhere. And, besides, Lady Gaga, yes, she does make songs that are a little similar to other artists&#8217; songs, but, that doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s exactly the same! Also, most of her songs don&#8217;t even sound close to other artists&#8217; songs! And, if they do, it would be just a small part. And the way she dresses just shows her creativity. It means that she does not want to be the same as other artists. She wants to be different to make an image of herself that says &#8220;Look it&#8217;s the girl with the crazy outfits!&#8221; She is crazy, but, that doesn&#8217;t mean that she&#8217;s completely unoriginal. And about the whole gay thing, she wants to show that it&#8217;s okay to be who you are. You said that she has no experience with those kinds of things, but she does. Many people have said that she&#8217;s a man. It&#8217;s not true. It is also believed if she&#8217;s bisexual. Who knows if it&#8217;s true. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your gay, les, or bi. You&#8217;re still a himan being. That&#8217;s the message she&#8217;s trying to get across. You obviously didn&#8217;t see that.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s not the new Madonna, and she&#8217;ll ever be. They&#8217;re so different. But please, stop saying that Gaga ripped off &#8216;&#8230;&#8217; and &#8216;&#8230;&#8217; because every fucking artist is inspired by someone else, Madonna the first (Marylin Monroe, Dietrich, Kylie Minogue and so many others). People act like she&#8217;s a &#8216;fraud&#8217; because she&#8217;s first person ever to be inspired by her idols. What a shame! Like stop. I&#8217;m sorry but event the  biggest legends were inspired, that doesn&#8217;t mean they copied. Every artist is unique, they have their own work. What I&#8217;m saying is that: nobody is original. You can be born with talent, and never get inspired but someone or something and never become an artist. GGaga never claimed herself to be original, either to be the queen of the gays. It&#8217;s funny when It comes to Gaga, oh that bad bitch, she copied so many people. But you can&#8217;t even realize that, that&#8217;s what every artist did before.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s not even copying. She took some ideas from the past and did her own things. so no, that&#8217;s not new or original. But that&#8217;s unique because Gaga worked on it, that&#8217;s her work, with her creativity. And that is what happened/happens with every artist. Madonna did the same, Kylie did the same, Roisin Murphy did the same, Christina, Britney,  I&#8217;m sorry but this is the truth. Gaga does nothing wrong. So, okay u don&#8217;t like her style, her music. And I respect ur opinion, people don&#8217;t have to love her. But u can&#8217;t say that. She has the balls to say: I&#8217;m inspire by &#8216;..&#8217; and &#8216;..&#8217;. She&#8217;s honest about it, u can&#8217;t blame her for that. Because if u do so, then u should have the same opinion about practically every artist. I&#8217;m not denying she&#8217;s inspired. But there&#8217;s nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>And please, stop taking her and her thing too seriously. That&#8217;s entertainment okay?</p>

<p>This recent &#8220;Lady Gaga backlash&#8221; is interesting. It seems that many people consider humility, poise, and modesty to be signs of genuineness and virtue in a pop star, and they feel upset that Lady Gaga is not currently embodying these traits. </p>
<p>They evidently do not like the mega over-the-top hyperreal superstar performance art package which, nevertheless, to her fans, has a lot of heart, soul, and fun as well.</p>
<p>But then &#8230; it has always been thus. Critics historically never really appreciate anyone who toys with, or blatantly mocks, the cherished ways and paradigms they know. Just read critical responses to Elvis Presley in the &#8217;50s (&#8220;a burlesque of a hound dog growling&#8221;), the Rolling Stones in the &#8217;60s (&#8220;the singer looks like a girl, can&#8217;t sing and sounds too black&#8221;), and David Bowie in the &#8217;70s (&#8220;a shallow freak show&#8221;).</p>
<p>For that matter, check out the outraged condemnations of the Ballets Russes&#8217; debut of Stravinsky&#8217;s &#8220;Rite of Spring&#8221; in Paris (1913).</p>

<p>You know you&#8217;ve made it when people start up websites to basically bash you. To me it&#8217;s simple you like her or you don&#8217;t. I respect her because you may say she&#8217;s fake and manufactured, but you fail to see her true talent. From the begining of her career she said what she was and hasn&#8217;t been anything but theatrical and shocking. If she doesn&#8217;t write all her own music she at least co-writes it a talent that is non-existent with most pop stars . She can play a bit of piano and she may not be the best dancer, but she does it better than any of her peers(Katy, Rihanna, Kesha). Her tours are damn near perpetual sell outs and she&#8217;s going on almost 2 years of damn near non-stop touring. To me her work ethic can&#8217;t be matched because unlike those others she is her art, she is her music, and she is her career. She completely lives it. To me an artist is someone who can invoke strong feelings in people. She does this not only with her most loyal fans but also her biggest critics.</p>

<p>I think the 2011 Gaga is just letting out what she didn&#8217;t in 2008 and the 2 years after that.<br />
The horns, the religious controversy, criticism to other Aritsts, etc&#8230;I think it&#8217;s honestly just another sign of her rebellion against the pedestal her Just Dance and Poker Face image put her on. She&#8217;s trying to get rid of her old image and create a new kind of Music and Life. She reminds me of Miley Cyrus in that sense.<br />
The new Diva attitude, the Alejandro video, the Meat Dress&#8230;She was even doing it in mid-2009. Before going on stage at Glastonbury she put a Dildo in her pants and flashed it during the performance to fuel the controversy about her possibly being a Hermaphrodite. Even though it&#8217;s what some might call manipulative or obnoxious, it&#8217;s just her marketing choice. I see nothing wrong with it, at least she&#8217;s not restraining herself.</p>

<p>Nicki Minaj&#8217;s song Save Me reminds me so much of Gaga. Idk, but I think it kind of describes how she feels about her fans and how they feel about her.<br />
Especially this verse:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not your fault I&#8217;m a bitch, I&#8217;m a Monster. Yes, I&#8217;m a beast﻿ and I feast when I conquer. But I&#8217;m alone on my Throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blah Blah Blah.<br />
Save your time people, Gaga has nothing in the words that come out of her mouth anyway. In the end, she&#8217;s just an Actress for the old birds in the background.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s her talent that brought her up in the industry so much, but rather her ability to catch people&#8217;s attention and her attitude towards life.<br />
She has confidence that borders on arrogance, and the &#8220;I&#8217;m such a badass bitch, bow the fuck down to me&#8221; attitude. Although a lot of critics find this unappealing, 86% of the general public love it. She has a dominative, ballsy mindset and she&#8217;s extremely conceited about herself. I strongly believe that is why her fans love her so much, because if they idolise someone like that, it can make THEM feel confident and dominative.<br />
Humility and classiness in celebrities is fading in popularity. Just look at the newer Artists like Nicki Minaj. Her lyrics express the kind of attitude Gaga displays. &#8220;I&#8217;m a bitch, I&#8217;m a cunt, and I kick that hoe, punt. Forced trauma, blunt; you play the back, bitch. I&#8217;m in the front&#8221; and &#8220;So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been. Yeah, I said it: HAS-BEEN.&#8221;<br />
Nicki even said herself that she chose &#8220;Minaj&#8221; as the last part of her stage name to express her superior rapping skills to other female rappers.<br />
Speaking in terms of Gaga&#8217;s Music, her songs are very trippy and dissociative. People love that.</p>

<p>Have you even heard other songs besides Telephone Just Dance and Pokerface? A lot of some real meaning to them and are not just about whatever you say they&#8217;re about. Quit taking everything and trying to turn it into WW3&#8230;you and alllllllllllllllllllllllll the other Britney Fans are pissed because Born This Way is doing hella better than Femme Fatale as well as GaGa in general doing better. Maybe I&#8217;d respect Britney as an artists if she sang live and wrote her own music. And wasn&#8217;t the manufactured INSANE bitch she is. You have the never to call GaGa insane/crazy when Britney had a huge mental breakdown and shaved her head? You are seriously dilusional and try to make a giant essay to make something look true&#8230;</p>

<p>She has her flaws,<br />
But she knows how to use them.<br />
She floats down Manipulation Road without fear.</p>
<p>She gets respect,<br />
And she controls those around her.<br />
She can make every trouble of yours disappear.</p>
<p>That girl will get you.<br />
That girl will win.<br />
That girl will push you where the ice is thin.<br />
That girl is freedom.<br />
That girl will kill.<br />
That girl will define a thrill.</p>
<p>She can&#8217;t let go,<br />
But she&#8217;ll sure drag you with her.<br />
She will show you how special you are.</p>
<p>She knows your fears,<br />
And she uses them against you.<br />
She shines just as bright as the brightest star.</p>
<p>That girl will take you.<br />
That girl will succeed.<br />
That girl will show you she&#8217;s beyond your reach.<br />
That girl will save you.<br />
That girl means harm.<br />
That girl will shock you with her charm.</p>
<p>She sees you when you&#8217;re sleeping.<br />
She knows when you&#8217;re awake.<br />
She knows if you&#8217;ve been bad or good.<br />
And she pounces on it.</p>
<p>Beware of that girl.<br />
She makes life an art.<br />
You&#8217;ve been warned not to cross her.<br />
Keep an eye on your heart.</p>
<p>That girl will ruin you.<br />
That girl runs free.<br />
She speaks in the third person<br />
So she can forget she&#8217;s Me.</p>

<p>I worry for Gaga nowdays.<br />
This is what some of her close friends told MTV about her behaviour since she got famous:<br />
&#8220;Stefani used to be so happy and full of life but lately Im shocked by how much she has changed she has gone off the deep end. She has this crazy room in her house. She sits with drawing charcoal in there and just writes all over the walls. Then she&#8217;ll have people come in and repaint it and then she&#8217;ll start all over again. Also, the idea for her infamous meat costume was the result of a cocaine-fuelled binge. She thinks doing drugs helps her as an artist but it&#8217;s gone too far now.&#8221;<br />
Gaga really is going downwards, emotionally. I hope it won&#8217;t destroy her the way it destroyed Britney and MJ.</p>

<p>Wow finally a group of people who have the same thoughts as I do. Basically- loved the old Gaga, fell for her story; s a young girl raised in a good home but wanting to come out of her shell, daddy gets mad, she retracts, daddy helps her in her carreer, she gets it, was humble and now all hell has breaken loose.  Love her music, with some exceptions with BTW, but wow this carreer of hers has really grown a large chip on her shoulders.<br />
It&#8217;s sad to see old interviews of her with  recent ones, I swear at times I feel she&#8217;s  like Sybil with mutiple personalties. And at times you can really tell she is insecure while putting on the best act ever.  </p>
<p>I have been to two of her concerts the first was at a smaller venue for The Monster ball,  it was awesome. Then I went to the newer version of the Monster Ball, the one with all the NY act and the large Monster at the end. I left before the last song came out.  I was pissed with the monologues in between songs, I realized I had heard them before in other concerts around the world I had seen on Youtube.</p>
<p>Word for Word, WTF. Yelling &#8221; I don&#8217;t lip sinc&#8221;, I love my fans, you complete me, I live and breath you guys, I was tochered as a kid, I was abused, the stage light is my moon, blah , blah, blah, OMG get to singing already.  AND BTW I was puking at the amount of charity bullshit and marketing going on throughout the whole fucking concerts: Japan bracelets, Virgin Mobile and poor homeless kids, GLTB with aids, blah blah blah&#8230;&#8230;oh yeah and some Lupus foundation. </p>
<p>Now I am begining to think the Japan wristband lawsuit, might actually be the charity that calls it what it is, charity for LADY GAGA?????? HMMMMM. </p>
<p>Anywho, I really think her limelight is about to run out, I see a very nasty future for her. Sad, because if u get rid of the costumes, charity talk, politic crap and all her other baggage.. place her on a piano, in a dark nightclub and letting her sing improve, WOW that&#8217;s what I would like. </p>
<p>I wish her the best, but as for me I&#8217;m done paying for concerts, mags and full cd&#8217;s. </p>
<p>PS love the blog, keep it up!</p>
<p>Lisettica MIA</p>

<p>That essay that you wrote is a lie. You say that Gaga fans are &#8220;eccentric, a bit freakish, maybe a bit of a misfit&#8221;, which is not true. I am a &#8220;little monster&#8221; myself, and, yes, I am eccentric but that does not mean that i am freakish or that I am a misfit. Yes, I may act weird at times, but, my friends love me for that. I have plenty of friends, so, I am not a misfit. That is stereotyping. Just because someone is a &#8220;little monster&#8221; does not mean that they are what you say they are.</p>

<p>GodGa wore a Mermaid Tail to remind Monsters that, regard of any conscious perception of the world and events around them, their Mind, Emotions and Soul will always be like the Sea &#8211; flowing neutrally along the Path of their inner being. Be at Peace and embrace yourself.</p>

<p>The Sinners accused our Mother Monster of belittling/dissing Britney Spears about her lipsyncing. This is simple Blasphemy. GodGa appreciates Britney&#8217;s singing voice and we all know she sung many songs live at her FF Tour. Praise GodGa and Miss Darling Spears.</p>

<p>Information on the name &#8220;Lady Gaga&#8221;:</p>
<p>Meaning: &#8220;One who is something of a shamelessly public Love/Hate Paradox&#8221;</p>
<p>Origin: This unknown-nationality name shot up in the stakes in late 2008, when the first-born of the name become a public icon/figure.</p>
<p>Some more info: The first-born Lady Gaga herself has achieved the status of being one of the most successful female singers of the past few years, despite not having a particularly awe-inspiring voice and only being of less-than-average physical attraction.</p>
<p>Her success could be ascribed to ambition and &#8220;deep character&#8221;, but, paradoxically, she is an incredibly shallow, ignorant, arrogant person, known for changing her style and image daily in order to keep all eyes on her career.</p>
<p>Her latest fad is to take the IRL concept of poor, familyless kids from the wrecks of Japan to use as Money cheques and rubber wristbands. Since early 2010, she has been voicing her words with a peculiar, slightly squeaky accent in a highly pretentious (As usual) attempt to sound &#8220;cute&#8221; or &#8220;softspoken&#8221;. Has a reputation for being rudely &#8220;outspoken&#8221;, classless, Misandric, stereotypical and self-obsessed.</p>
<p>She has also dabbled in the Gay rights movement, at which she has proved to be a notable failure and laughing stock, as she doesn&#8217;t have any passion or depth within her character on which to draw true ambition from.<br />
Over the years, fans have created Caricatures of Lady Gaga. All of these have proved themselves to be a complete insult and shocking pisstake at the Lady herself, considering the fact that every single one of them has an incredibly vacant pair of eyes, an anorexic body, a jutting chin, an ugly fish-pout lips, and a nose the size and mass of Mount Everest.<br />
i.e: Lady Gaga is a Bitch!</p>

<p>Cheers to hating this Lady Gaga person. I live in a coutnry where she&#8217;s not very popular at all, so I have no idea what she&#8217;s really like, but so far she seems like a real self-obsessed Mary Sue whose stage persona reads like a self-insertion RPF fanfic.</p>

<p>When you are dodging Debris<br />
Just watch the Grammys<br />
When the BOMBS<br />
Are exploding like that<br />
Just put on<br />
My reissued DJ Slipmatt<br />
Or else&#8230;<br />
You know<br />
You&#8217;ll look like Non-Monster Poo<br />
When the Wind<br />
Is taking control<br />
Find a nice Butcher&#8217;s<br />
And jump into the beef casserole<br />
Wear that meat, gurl<br />
Or else&#8230;<br />
You&#8217;ll look like Non-Monster Poo</p>

<p>&#8220;There’s something heroic about the way my fans operate their cameras. So precisely and intricately, so proudly, and so methodically. Like Kings writing the history of their people. It’s their prolific nature that both creates and procures what will later be perceived as the “kingdom.” So, the real truth about Lady Gaga fans lies in this sentiment: They are the kings. They are the queens. They write the history of the kingdom, while I am something of a devoted Jester.</p>
<p>It is in the theory of perception that we have established our bond. Or, the lie, I should say, for which we kill. We are nothing without our image. Without our projection. Without the spiritual hologram of who we perceive ourselves to be, or to become, in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloody hell, just when I thought Stefani wasn&#8217;t fanatical enough. She gets worse. Although I have to give her points on the marketing scale, it&#8217;s brilliant. I feel sorry for the poor girl she used to be, she got was the one who got put through that. She&#8217;s dead though. Nothing left. All that&#8217;s left now is Gaga. Bloody Gaga.</p>

<p>This song describes the Showbiz Industry perfectly. Well, with a few tweaks.</p>

<p>Miss Gaga had some Monsters<br />
Her Monsters liked to suck<br />
And when they drank up all her creativity<br />
She didn&#8217;t give a<br />
Funny when Beyonce<br />
Had locked her in the Pussy Wagon cell<br />
Miss Gaga screamed all night that Madonna should go to Bloody<br />
Hello to Eminem<br />
With bandana old and tore<br />
He&#8217;ll tie you to the All-white table<br />
Then he&#8217;ll mutilate your<br />
Come, it&#8217;s nearly Tour-time<br />
The Korean fans arrive<br />
The Beatles bleed them all until there&#8217;s no one left A<br />
- Lively little Rappers<br />
Are eaten up by Hip-Hop&#8217;s biggest Cats<br />
We&#8217;re subject to experiments<br />
Like Labatory<br />
Rats, I&#8217;ve dropped a Piano<br />
How easily they break<br />
I&#8217;m on my hands and knees until<br />
I pay for my mis<br />
- Take off all your Hilton clothing<br />
Redone&#8217;s only just begun<br />
We have no Anesthesia<br />
It&#8217;s eighteen forty<br />
One thing MJ should tell you<br />
Before you try again<br />
The tests are all invented by a lot of filthy<br />
Mentally Hysteric<br />
She&#8217;s failed the exam<br />
Don&#8217;t bother telling Gaga<br />
For she doesn&#8217;t give a<br />
Damn that Conservatorship oxide<br />
For when you can&#8217;t escape<br />
They say the Producers oft commit a Murder of a<br />
Razor Mics are rusty<br />
And not a lot of fun<br />
So when they try to amputate your career<br />
You&#8217;d better run<br />
And fetch the Violinist<br />
Dear Britney&#8217;s feeling sad<br />
She&#8217;s been in the Cable room for ages<br />
And she isn&#8217;t even<br />
Madness is a nuiscance<br />
And no one is immune<br />
Your idol, fave or secret family member may become a raving<br />
Lunatics are dangerous<br />
And Classicals are obeyed<br />
They also go together just like Toast and Marma<br />
- Ladies are like Children<br />
With brains the size of Subwoofers<br />
Let&#8217;s give #1 hit singles<br />
To all the little SNSD<br />
Girls are helpless treasures<br />
That Celebrity Mothers must protect<br />
So lie upon the SoShi nameplate<br />
For the labels to in<br />
- Speculums are super<br />
And Disney all the Rage<br />
So spread Destiny Hope&#8217;s legs and put her back into her<br />
Cage of dancing crazies<br />
The Producer&#8217;s here to bleed<br />
The Label owners are all learned Men<br />
And some can&#8217;t even<br />
- Singing can be risky<br />
For BGT Women on the verge<br />
It only did Susan worlds of good<br />
To poison, leech and<br />
- Purging is a penance<br />
Public Anorexia&#8217;s a chore<br />
No need to sterilize the MV<br />
We never did<br />
Before the Show is over<br />
Before you go backstage<br />
Angie will take a Hammer and a Nail<br />
And Jam it in your<br />
Headstones in the Condo<br />
And statues on the catwalk<br />
Are not for the Musically insane<br />
Just leave them rotting in the D-A-R-K<br />
Dark<br />
Dark<br />
Dark<br />
Dark<br />
Dark</p>

<p>I think a more accurate statement is &#8220;Lady Gaga Is A Frau.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even if, for the sake of argument, she was truly a fraud, I&#8217;d have to say that her fraudulence is more interesting than many of the other pop stars&#8217; genuineness.</p>

<p>Marshall McLuhan said &#8220;art is whatever you can get away with&#8221;. That sounds much like Gaga&#8217;s &#8220;art is a lie&#8221;. But that is all post-modern art school 101 crap.  Gaga is all high art this, deconstruction that. But the sociopathic narcissism at the core Gaga makes her think she is the first one whoever thought that. And she reminds me of a family member who thinks that if anyone in the family does well, we do so just to make her look bad. So Katy Perry is only singing about freedom and personal liberation so she can make Gaga look bad, so Gaga has to attack Kerry. </p>
<p>Either that or she is a product of some CIA experiment, to see how they can use pop culture for mind control and brain washing. Her statement &#8220;tell a lie until becomes truth&#8221; is not that far off Nazi Goebbels line: &#8220;If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it&#8221;. But what is even more chilling is that what she represents is the far from freedom. She is all about corporate &#8216;hoing &#8211; being the ultimate taste-maker, and empty vessel that can be dressed up any way. Or as Goebbels said: It is the absolute right of the State to supervise the formation of public opinion. Her little monsters aren&#8217;t clamoring for revolution. Her empowerment of the misfits isn&#8217;t for radical change &#8211; it is simply to sell them misfit products and more scarily, make them subservient to her.</p>

<p>You were a Monster at one point? Well, then. Dude; I&#8217;ll tell you. I&#8217;ve had a dozen Sugar Mommy Artists like Gaga. They&#8217;re all tricks. Don&#8217;t let them sucker you. It lasts practically a few months or weeks of their career. They all act like you and your fellow fans are the people who make them feel happy and the ones they&#8217;ve been looking for, then they get bored with you and put you out, try and steal another Artist&#8217;s fans. That&#8217;s how it works. Enjoy it while it lasts.<br />
You know what your true problem is? In your Life, you were living in this, like, emotional vacuum, only you didn&#8217;t know it, right? But this bitch did. She knows you need affection as much as you need food and clothes and air. So she throws it into the package. You&#8217;re so hungry for somebody, anybody, to give a crap about you, pretty soon she&#8217;s got you hooked. We all need a little Love &#8211; and in the Hell most of us live in, we&#8217;ll take it any way it comes. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed, dude. It happens to everybody with Sugar Mommies. And these Celebrities get off on the Emotional Manipulation as much as the Fame and Worship. How else can you build up your self-esteem when you haven&#8217;t got the charm or the Sexiness? We&#8217;re stray cats they pick up in the street and pet for a little while. It&#8217;s a challenge to get us to relax and purr, but as soon as they win, they get bored or we crap once in the corner and they boot us. I thought you&#8217;d been through it before. I forgot how new you are at this. Don&#8217;t feel bad, though. The same thing happens to hostages. Sometimes they&#8217;re held captive so long they start to see things from the terrorists&#8217; point of view. People talk about it on TV.</p>

<p>Man this is the dumbest f***ing essay I&#8217;ve seen in a while. Why does it matter? Can&#8217;t you just listen to Britney and be respectful of others? I would recommend  just keeping these thoughts to yourself and your friends. It doesn&#8217;t do anyone any good.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what RedOne, Darkchild, Fernando Garibay, Rob Fusari, Akon, Martin Kierszenbaum, and about fifty other engineers, backing vocalists, producers, writers, musicians, marketing assistants and A&amp;R reps would have to say about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>RedOne, Fernando, and DJWS confirmed that Gaga writes all of her music and melodies&#8230;</p>

<p>Then please explain why Rob Fusari sued Gaga for writing credit on some of her biggest hits.  His name, after an undisclosed settlement, is now displayed as &#8220;writer&#8221;.</p>
<p>So much for credit where credit is due &#8211; the truth wouldn&#8217;t have made her look like such a musical &#8220;genius&#8221; to the general masses, now, would it?</p>
<p>FYI: The lawsuit was settled in September 2010 &#8211; you have no excuse to not have noticed Fusari&#8217;s name attached now.</p>
<p>As to Gaga&#8217;s countersuit?  Please.  I don&#8217;t know how someone can be &#8220;lured&#8221; when she was f***ing the guy, knowing full-well he had a fiancee.</p>

<p>Wow a whole essay on Lady Gaga, someone needs to get a life, its pop music, and most people aren&#8217;t stupid, they know how pop music works. But to feel the need to write something so long and so opinionated, it&#8217;s something you keep to yourself, because when your opinion and lack of evidence are simply attacking others, you need to go and take a long hard look at yourself, that you could be doing something more profound with your time then writing about just another person who has reached fame.<br />
And there are things I agree with, but a lot I disagree with. And I freely admit that I listen to her music, and I let my children listen to her music, but I wouldn&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m obsessed with her, if I was though it wouldn&#8217;t be a category of yes: obsessed or no: not obsessed; it would be on a continuum, where I would be at the lower end you would be at the higher, because this kind of thing can plainly be seen to be an obsession. Obsessed with the anti-gaga, which in itself you have become obsessed with her.<br />
And this article, though anti-gaga, it is still profoundly reminiscent of the fact that people become consumed by this world of fame, that even those who are supposedly against it have themselves become enveloped by it. And by doing so you yourself are manipulating people, encouraging hate, which the world already has too much of, and although Lady Gaga herself manipulated/s to get fame and continue being famous, never has hate been spread by the figure of Gaga.<br />
So buddy I&#8217;d have a look at yourself, in the mirror, not just because you are spreading hate, but because you are conforming to the basic structure of the media &#8220;to manipulate to spread an opinion, that will change others&#8221;, and by proclaiming yourself as against the figure that is Gaga, you yourself have been manipulated by the media machine.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, professional Psychological Media Analyst.</p>
<p>P.S. I agree with what you say that Britney Spears doesn&#8217;t have to get involved with politics if she doesn&#8217;t want to, but as a gay man I am so unimpressed with the fact that you slam Lady Gaga for doing it, I believe as any gay person believes, any help is good help for this constant debate, whether you are famous or not.</p>
<p>P.S.S. Also minor note, there is the section on whether she writes her own songs, with the support of what would appear to be evidence against this fact, if it were actual research you&#8217;d find all of these producers and writers confirm that she writes her own lyrics and melodies, and then if you had actually looked further into the pop music process you&#8217;d find that they work on top of this, which involves changing the lyrics now and again, that Lady Gaga must confirm any changes made, which are all but minor, and that the melodies in their simplest forms are all hers. You simply need to look at any other artist who has been noted to write their own songs, look at the bi-line and you&#8217;ll see more than their name, because there is a difference between raw lyrics and it actually sound like a song.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see if I have this Swarovski: You berate the essay writer for creating a long entry about something he has an opinion on, then you proceed to write a long-winded one yourself!  Hilarious, professional psychological media analyst&#8230; O.o</p>
<p>I said it above, and I&#8217;ll say it to you: Explain the settlement with Rob Fusari &amp; why he is suddenly getting writing credit for some of her earliest hits.</p>

<p>Dude,EXCUSE MEH.This is hella useless.You think you looks better than her obsessive fans who you&#8217;re continuously referring to as &#8216;Monster Cult&#8217;?WHO IS LADY GAGA?She&#8217;s just another popstar.Why do you have to analyse and interpret EVERY motherfucking thing a popstar has done/is doing?Why do you give so much shit about the words,actions and personality of a single person/character?This pretty much shows how important she is in your life.Like,do you have no hobbies?I don&#8217;t know as much as you do about her,so I can&#8217;t judge whether whatever you have said is valid or not,but I&#8217;d be the last one to believe all of this cause you&#8217;re clearly trying to slander her and are presenting everything in a manipulatively negative manner.Negative obsession is worse than positive and hence,you&#8217;re far worse than her fans.If you&#8217;re paid to slander her,you&#8217;re pathetic.And if this bullshit is a result of plain obsession,grow the fuck up.Anti monster cult&lt;Monster cult&lt;people who are still sane to not dedicate their life in observing and talking about some popstar.</p>

<p>You make the classic mistake of thinking about pop music only in terms of entertainment.</p>
<p>An advert (commercial) might well be &#8216;entertaining&#8217; (many adverts really are extremely entertaining) but an advert&#8217;s job is to sell a product. It&#8217;s job is to change your thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and ultimately behaviour to make you want to buy the product or service. We know advertising WORKS! The advertising industry is worth billions of dollars because it can generate even more money affecting our buying habits and even our lifestyles!</p>
<p>Now, do you think the people paid to be in the adverts know (or particularly care) much about the product they&#8217;re selling or what kind of subtle psychological techniques are being used to sell it? Of course not, they just want the money.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the difference between an advert and a mainstream pop music video? Both are made by corporations who only care about money. Both are aimed at consumers. Both employ celebs / good looking/ young people to make the product more appealing. Both are designed to make you feel a certain way and both contain strictly controlled information which the corporations paying for it all have final say over!</p>
<p>There are differences &#8211; sure &#8211; but they are not THAT different from each other.</p>
<p>Also we know that the Pentagon has a special department for working with Hollywood movie scripts to make sure movies promote war and the military. They even admit this fact. This is the literal definition of propaganda! And it is also why most movies make war and the military look glamorous.</p>
<p>So do you REALLY think no one has ever thought to use pop music to influence people (especially young people) in the same way as movies (or adverts)????</p>
<p>Are you really that naive?</p>
<p>Why do you think all (mainstream) pop music videos look the same and have the same basic message? Why do all A-list pop star / rap stars promote corporatism, money, trashy sex, being a dumbed down consumer, violence, war etc?</p>
<p>And why don&#8217;t they ever make music which criticizes governments or corruption or corporatism or the banks or promote a lifestyle which doesn&#8217;t involve selling your soul to have money and cars and big houses and stuff? These all used to be common subjects in popular music.</p>
<p>The message promoted by all the big name mainstream acts today is: &#8220;be a dumbed down idiot, be obsessed with money and bling and consumerism, because acting like a vacuous celeb who has sold out to the industry is really cool&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe it is you who needs to grow up?</p>

<p>As gay myself I completely agree with this essay.</p>
<p>I find Lady Gaga&#8217;s comments on being gay is super-fucking-awesome (When most gays know that it is the exact opposite of this) incredibly condescending. I just wanna be recognized as a human being AND NOT RECOGNIZED FOR MY SEXUALITY.<br />
- What makes that so hard for people to understand is beyond my imagination. Have you ever stopped to wonder why gays are being discriminated.. Because people are so busy pointing the differences instead of point at the similarities.. We are all intelligent flesh and blood humans.</p>
<p>I find it further condescending that she promotes the fucking queers of my minority, making the rest of society think that every gay in this (Excuse this, but there really isn&#8217;t a better term for it) God forsaken World is a queer.<br />
- When I finally dare to go to a straight club people are actually SURPRISED that I&#8217;m gay. Why? Because I don&#8217;t act like a fucking queer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have artists like Christina Aguilera who promotes anti hate-crimes through her videos instead of publicly stating how super awesome gays are. That&#8217;s the message to send instead of the fucked up message Lady Gaga sends which does nothing but worsen the gay cause.</p>
<p>Obviously there are people on this blog (some comments) whom does not get the point of this essay. It wasn&#8217;t written overnight, more likely it was written over a long period of time. It wasn&#8217;t written because of an obsession but to prove all you Tard Monsters that you&#8217;re idolizing a persona that is utterly fake to the core.<br />
It is -very- well-written which underlines the fact that we&#8217;re dealing with an educated person who hardly has the time to obsess over such a pathetic persona as is the case with Lady Gaga.<br />
It is well documented and it would surely go as an essay at my University where I study English. It&#8217;s even shorter than what I write about artists such as Shakespeare, English pop culture phenomenas and I could keep on going.</p>

<p>I know this comment is a billion years old, but this &#8220;I don&#8217;t act like a fucking queer&#8221; stuff is harmful to all of us. I can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t excuse the term, not when it&#8217;s used in the exact same way straight people have used it &#8212; to hurt gay and alienate gay people for specific behaviors (or often enough, gay people, full stop). As a reclaimed identity I can stomach it, although even then, I cringe a little, flashing back to growing up and hearing people talk about &#8220;them _queers_.&#8221; </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve internalized hate for gay people who don&#8217;t &#8220;act straight,&#8221; if you&#8217;re proud that you &#8220;don&#8217;t act like a fucking queer,&#8221; you are a part of the problem. Yes, it&#8217;s endlessly tiring when straight people have a monolithic view of what it is to be gay, but it&#8217;s also a punch in the gut for a so called &#8220;queer&#8221; to have their identity and personality put down because of something straight people do. Gaga shouldn&#8217;t be stereotyping  gay people, but the community shouldn&#8217;t be turning on itself either in response. Granted, she&#8217;s actually bisexual (an often erased identity, and I will fight anyone who tries), but I know where you&#8217;re coming from. I&#8217;m not fond of the way she represents the community at all, nor the way she co-opts gay men specifically as if she intimately understands their experiences, while playing mostly on stereotypes.</p>

<p>And I don&#8217;t like Britney Spears, nor do I like Ke$ha and I&#8217;m seriously disappointed in Christina Aguilera for bother to copy Lady Gaga.</p>
<p>So no, I&#8217;m not a fan of either.</p>
<p>I like the music to some extend. It is good party music, no doubt about it.</p>

<p>Haha. Y&#8217;all haters really have nothing else to do in your life. Truth is, nobody can stop the Lady Gaga phenomenon, so stop bitching about it already. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m a &#8220;little monster&#8221; or whatever, I just don&#8217;t see the point of trying to bring down a person you can&#8217;t. Accept it. She&#8217;s here to stay.</p>

<p>Anyone who puts an album out for 99cents does not believe in their own work or strength, Lady GaGa&#8217;s time is over&#8230; deal with it, her singles sales are on their way down and her second album of the decade as she put it is anything BUT that, how many copies has it sold? 8 million? Madonna&#8217;s Like A Virgin had sold 20 million in 1 year WITHOUT the internet, mobile phones, MTV, Mp3&#8242;s&#8230; Lady GaGa was the brightest star in the sky for like 2 seconds, based on everybody elses ideas too! In the UK the worlds third largest music market, NONE of her recent singles made the top 3 and her album only managed to reach number 2. The same is true of many other European countries. The world has called time on her ass and honestly, i think many people are glad. She is a fraud, a fake, a corporate puppet for money makers and managers who use her to line their own pockets, they pushed her down the Madonna route for their own gain. She is as manufactured as any star of Pop Idol or Xfactor. Madonna? She is the only star alive today who has total control over her career&#8230; and she has been in control of that career since 1982. Deal with it.</p>

<p>I dont think I&#8217;d accept her back if she changed to the old lady gaga, not with all she&#8217;s done, I mean I think she a fucking confused fucking weirdo now. All the stupid songs shes made since bad romance, especially judas. I don&#8217;t like her anymore, she made her bed now she has to lay in it. I wonder what crazy shit she&#8217;ll pull off once she isn&#8217;t popular anymore.</p>

<p>I think you all have nothing better to do but to hate on her. Everytime there is a new artist wanting to be different then most musicians all of you start to hate. Lady gaga has her own art of music. and people who dislike her just dont care, quit complaing.</p>

<p>Yeah, it is a bit sad.  In a couple of years there will  be another pop artist, and this joke, and others, will just be waiting with their convoluted and asinine reasoning as to why there is something wrong with them.  Advice: Move on with your life, and deal with more important things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady gaga has her own art of music&#8221;</p>
<p>How is rehashing old music her &#8220;own art of music&#8221;  ?   It&#8217;s as if you people have no music education.</p>

<p>Wow, stretching a bit, aren&#8217;t we?  I think you might need to find something better to do with your time rather than ripping a part pop artists.  Sorry to say this, she is human, and is going to have insecurities.  It happens to the best of us.  I know some of the most confident people in the world, and they still struggle with insecurities, and surprise, they sometimes are concerned about what people say about them.  Also, she is a pop artist.  Most of them are pretty outlandish. Is there not anything more important for you to write about?</p>

<p>Anybody who has to put an album out for 99cents in my humble opinion despite ALL of their own claims, is desperate and not truthfuly confident in their own work or artist. Go back in time to 1983 and Madonna&#8217;s debut album sold around 9 million copies&#8230; This was based soley on record sales&#8230; CD&#8217;s hadnt even taken off back then. There was NO internet, no mobile phones and certainly no mp3&#8242;s to ripp off either. Madonna did a round of mini-gigs and promo&#8217;s in North America, Europe and Asia, that was it, no meat dresses, no gay rights activism, no stupid statements no nothing! Even the pop video was in its crudest of form, MTV didnt even exist! Madonna&#8217;s aura and talent sold those 9 million albums and put her on her way to TRUE legendary status. Even her second album which has now sold over 25 million copies sold only on its merit and NOT plagiaristic iconography&#8230; Shift forward and True Blue her third opus would eventually sell more than 30 million copies&#8230; Again there was no internet, no facebook, no twitter, CD&#8217;s were still not the most popular format even in 1986! Madonna sold 61 million albums with her first 3 combined&#8230; the first 2 were sleepers spending years on the Hot 200, all of this without the net and without a lot of fanfare&#8230; The only controversy was her raw outspoken sexuality and discussions of topics such as teen pregnancy (Pap Dont Preach), sexuality (Like A Virgin) and homosexuality (including gay characters in her Open Your Heart video). But compared to Lady GaGa&#8217;s awful media onslaught Madonna appeared quite lazy&#8230; or was she? Without all the technology back then Madonna worked her ass off with what that period in time gave her&#8230; and yet with all of her efforts and ridiculous fakery and controversy, Lady GaGa still can never match the success Madonna had with her first 3 albums. GaGa&#8217;s singles may have done well but not nearly as well as Madonna&#8217;s given the time. Lady GaGa may be doing ok(ish) by today&#8217;s standards, but put her up against a legend and she she simply diminishes away. I actually think her days may be numbered, i dont think she will go away (shame), but her legacy is built on others formulas and success, and people are already seeing through that blatant fakery and narcissism. Once the gay community turns on her (which they are doing), she will slide&#8230; it has already begun.</p>

<p>you don&#8217;t make sense! Im not gay and i am a monster! Studies show that 30% of Lady Gaga&#8217;s little monster is mad up of the LGBT community wile 70% is made up of the straight community! Lady Gaga has never done well as Madonna, I agree! But she has only been at this for 4 yrs while Madonna has been at it for years and years! Lady Gaga made the world&#8217;s most powerful woman in just 4 years bashing Oprah who by the way has been out longer than Lady Gaga! Madonna never appeared on this list. The fact being that Lady Gaga just doesn&#8217;t sit about and write and sell songs, she goes out there and makes a difference (she created the Born This Way Foundation), and before she she created the foundation and before the idea even came to her she appeared on the list for the Worlds Most Influential Person. Madonna again did not make it here. Lady Gaga was named new Queen of Pop in 4 years and it took Madonna 10 or so to achieve this title. On the other hand, you are saying Lady Gaga doesn&#8217;t work her head off like Madonna? At a concert Lady Gaga collapsed after too much rehearsal and well a lot of work! Here is what she tweeted: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GagaloosPanda/status/152936851420880896/photo/1" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/#!/GagaloosPanda/status/152936851420880896/photo/1</a>  -Read from the bottom- According to my sources Madonna had fallen sick and cancelled ALL concerts for that month (of which she had fallen ill) I do not know where you got that information with Lady Gaga putting her album out for 99c but it is false! Lady Gaga&#8217;s FIRST single (Just Dance) made it to Billboard 1 and stayed there for weeks and weeks worldwide! It was one of the biggest songs ever in pop, and she made a record for that song! The Monster Ball Tour  broke 3 records! Lady Gaga has done all of this and possibly more in 4 YEARS! While it took Madonna to get where she is at about 12 years! Doesn&#8217;t 4 years proved how hard Lady Gaga worked?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m younger than Lady Gaga, but honestly I don&#8217;t see her as a Madonna for young people AT ALL. Never!<br />
People should stop spreading that concept&#8230; The older you are, the less you like Gaga? lmao<br />
Madonna is Madonna for all ages. Madonna is the new Madonna. And Lady Gaga is just&#8230; there.</p>

<p>I find it kind of insulting how she goes around calling herself pansexual/bisexual, when all of her friends say she dates men in suits.</p>

<p>Again, I know this comment is a billion years old, but. I find the constant erasure of pan/bi people, especially women, far more than a little insulting. You do realize that pan/bi women are, uh, usually capable of liking men, right? That it&#8217;s part of the identity? You realize that you don&#8217;t stop being pan/bi if you date a guy, or several guys, or if other people don&#8217;t outwardly perceive your identity, right?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no quota required before you get to have your Not Straight wings. The way bi/pan folk get treated is fucking toxic. Having to &#8220;prove&#8221; your identity at every turn to monosexual straight and gay people alike (when you&#8217;re not flat out being told you&#8217;re doing it for attention or don&#8217;t exist) gets reeeeal old. I don&#8217;t even like Gaga, and I don&#8217;t like the way she interfaces with the LGBTQ community, but I hate this crap far more.</p>

<p>Also&#8230; she had her &#8216;Fame Monster&#8217; album which talks about her MONSTERS. The songs are about things that have made her life difficult and at times, painful. She calls herself &#8216;Mother MONSTER&#8217;, and that&#8217;s fine. You can slam yourself all you want, but then she goes ahead and calls her FANS &#8216;monsters&#8217;. So is she referring to them as something as bad as the stuff she wrote about in her album? Is she really comparing them?</p>
<p>Then again, the term &#8216;Little Monster&#8217; has been around for a very long time, typically meaning &#8216;a child who is rude and misbehaves&#8217;. I just think that&#8217;s rude to call of her fans.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not meaning to be rude.<br />
Listen to her song bad kids.<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be insecure if if your heart is pure, you&#8217;re still good to me if your a bad kid, baby.&#8221;<br />
She&#8217;s not the usual goody-goody pop artist with the goody-goody fans.<br />
She has fans that are gay, bi, rebels, emos, and much more.<br />
but instead of calling themselves that, they call themselves &#8220;Little Monsters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mostly spot on, but one correction. Christian conservatives (such as myself) do not see all gays as the stereotype you mentioned. By stating that, you just indulged in some stereotyping of your own.</p>
<p>Your assertion that Lady GaGa and Sarah Palin think they&#8217;re more important than they are is bullshit. Both are still pretty influential in their respective spheres whether you like it or not. In fact, at the recent CPAC, Occupy protesters tried to mic-check her speech, but were shouted down by those knuckle-dragging, inbred bigoted conservatives. That, and her endorsement is highly prized by those evil, gay killing men running for the Republican nomination.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;re just fringe fanatics, right? Like the Little Monsters?</p>

<p>Lady Gaga is generic. Her music is generic. Her &#8220;art&#8221; is generic, a taking what others invented and &#8220;dumbing down&#8221; for the masses. Her fans are generic. Her ideas rehashed and made lukewarm, so the generic can &#8220;understand&#8221; &#8220;deep art&#8221;. There is nothing &#8220;new&#8221; about &#8220;Lady Gaga&#8221;. She is bland commercial and it&#8217;s interesting who has hopped onto her bandwagon, aswell. </p>
<p>She&#8217;s the &#8220;crazy&#8221; for the bland mass mainstream.</p>

<p>First thing: Have you ever saved lives? Lady Gaga&#8217;s entire Born This Way album inspired teenagers who were about to commit suicide to stay alive. Can you do that?<br />
Second Thing: Lady Gaga does like to speak about herself a lot I agree! Do you know the reason? she said &#8220;don&#8217;t idolize me, idolize yourself&#8221; shes trying to tell her fans to idolize themselves just like how she idolized her self. Can you teach people that?<br />
Third: Lady Gaga&#8217;s Youth Churches are not to preach religion but to preach INDIVIDUALITY! Her quotes and what she says are to inspire.<br />

<p>Lady Gaga is actually mildly mentally retarded. I think I&#8217;ve read an article on it.</p>

<p>Omg what a lot of Scheiße !!! You just don&#8217;t have the intellegence to understand her &#8230; Her lyrics , her outfits,her videos and everything she says this is just so twisted and I had to laugh at how pathetic this was. Get a life and stop writin essays spreading negativity! Gaga is an amazing woman and she has changed the lives of millions of people around the world and has gave hope and bravery to so many !! Just for the record I am a little monster guys and I am proud of it ! She gave me confidence and I just hope you people see that life is too short to sit and be negative like this &#8230; Leave Gaga to do her job cause she is fucking good at it AND the bitch really can sing</p>

<p>It seems to always be the case: that the philosophers of resistance, marginal poets &amp; the enemies of hegemony one day find that their rule-breaking has turned into just the thing they despise: the rules.<br />
Christianity went from the hopeful street faith of prostitutes &amp; the poor to being the primary oppressive force in Western culture.<br />
The American Revolution turned into the American Empire.Focault flipped modern academia on it&#8217;s head; but what came next was a PC academia even more intolerant than the one it replaced.<br />
And that leads us to now.<br />
The strategies that pop&#8217;s iconic iconoclasts (Bowie, Grace Jones, Madonna) once employed to challenge the mainstream (roleplaying, performance, theatrics, genderbending, hypersexuality, chameleonic masks) are no longer effective; stripped of their raisons d&#8217;etre, they have been repurposed as moneymakers for the mainstream itself.<br />
Put simply, the rebellion&#8217;s weapons have become the bouncing tits of the establishment in a forced, cash-raking lapdance called GAGA.<br />
“What I’ve discovered is that in art, as in music, there’s a lot of truth—and then there’s a lie. The artist is essentially creating his work to make this lie a truth, but he slides it in amongst all the others. The tiny little lie is the moment I live for, my moment. It’s the moment that the audience falls in love.”-Lady Gaga<br />
Truer words were never spoken by Lady Gaga: her audience has fallen in love with a lie.<br />
Stefani Germanotta&#8217;s Lady Gaga IS a performance, but it is not performance ART; it is an ACT.<br />
The truth is that Stefani Germanotta was not a &#8220;loser in high school&#8221;. She was not bullied. She was rich, popular and well-liked, an it-girl in the in-crowd; a daddy&#8217;s girl who never had to pay her own rent; her biography REEKS of privilege.<br />
Why don&#8217;t people see through it?<br />
Lady Gaga is no outcast; she is a SIMULATION of outcast; Jean Genet as portrayed by Gallagher, complete with wacky props; at worst, worse than fake: a cynical, Republican parody of marginality.</p>

<p>Of course Lady Gaga is a lie. Thank goodness. Can you imagine an artist who simply gets up there and dutifully reports true facts? That would be rather boring, wouldn&#8217;t it? Being an artist is a creative endeavor, after all. Lies are fiction, truths are non-fiction.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s funny how Lady Gaga&#8217;s detractors feel that their puritan ethics of pop stardom have been torn asunder by her.</p>
<p>Artists like Bowie are totally safe and mainstream today. Their work is in the museum of acceptable history. While Bowie was controversial (about as reviled as he was admired) in the &#8217;70s, almost no one today is repulsed or shocked by his old images and statements. As for Madonna, she was a corporate hustler from day one &#8230;</p>

<p>You&#8217;re a moron who knows nothing about Art.<br />
Have you ever heard the phrase &#8220;Art is a lie that leads us closer to the truth&#8221;?<br />
Gaga&#8217;s lies are simply that: LIES.<br />
As for saying that what Bowie did is &#8216;safe&#8217; now and that what Gaga does isn&#8217;t, I have to laugh heartily.<br />
What exactly has she done which is so controversial?<br />
What boundaries is she pushing?</p>

<p>Frankly&#8230;<br />
I LOVE that Lady Gaga uses style/devices from other artists. She is called Lady GAGA, therefore, she uses recognizable &#8216;crazy&#8217; things from Gaga singers we know and love. It’s a compilation. It’s like all things crazy had a crazy orgy and, yes, this was the crazy result. Don’t knock &#8216;er for paying tribute. And personally, I think if she were “ripping it off”, Gaga wouldn’t be so blatant. She&#8217;s proven time and time again that she likes to showcase her favorites and has fun giving them a salute.</p>

<p>never in the history of pop has any artist so cunningly created an army of hateful awful people as The Little Monsters. She should be ashamed of herself for preying on very disturbed young people to do her dirty deeds..like when they swarmed Adele&#8217;s videos and called her names because she won a few Grammys, or banded together to insult Kelly Osbourne (telling her to die??) and now go to any Madonna video and you will see the hatred&#8230; it&#8217;s really awful. But all this aside, gaga&#8217;s biggest issue is that&#8230; without all of these little monsters, she is completely banal and unoriginal</p>

<p>I think Lady Gaga is just in it for fame, she’s selling out to every kid that thinks that they are a ‘troubled individual’, come on now just because you don’t have a million friends doesn’t make you a ‘freak’ or anything.</p>

<p>I agree with you on so many points, but I have to say that I went to her Ball last night and had fun. I enjoyed myself. Regardless of that hypocrisy, that disconnect, I appreciate her music and her performances. </p>
<p>You said that &#8220;she is particularly ill-equipped for such a role, given that she herself compromised her identity to win stardom!&#8221; &#8211; but really, who is truly &#8220;equipped&#8221; to do such a thing? Have we not all sacrificed &#8220;ourselves&#8221; (if there is such a thing), have we not all sold out in some form? As far as I&#8217;m concerned, we&#8217;re all guilty of everything you touched upon. Perhaps not to the same extent, or in regards to sexuality, but I have no doubt each and every one of us do the same thing (just in other forms) &#8211; stereotyping a group of people, and treating them accordingly. Sure, that doesn&#8217;t mean we should ignore it all, but I would rather have someone &#8211; anyone &#8211; with such influence encourage their audience away from hatred, bitterness, conformity and all that rot than just ignore it. Even if it incredibly hypocritical to do so.</p>
<p>I am not a &#8216;Little Monster&#8217; myself, but honestly I feel that this essay &#8211; and so many of the responses &#8211; looses sight of a bigger picture. Attacking someone, even if it is in response to cult-like following and attacks on your person, for &#8216;flaws&#8217; we all share is pointless. I could right an essay like this on every single person I know, or don&#8217;t really know but have just seen in the media.</p>
<p>Having said all that, the same goes for &#8216;Little Monsters&#8217; all too often they loose sight of the fact that Gaga is human, and not necessarily what they see and perceive her to be.</p>

<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m not going to go back and forth with a disturbed child molester over someone I don&#8217;t know and don&#8217;t give two fucks about. so this is the first and last time I&#8217;ll address you.Grow a brain? How about you grow a life and stop obsessively hating on and debating about pop stars? You&#8217;re pathetic. Don&#8217;t even reply because you&#8217;re wasting your time.</p>

<p>LOL. Lady Gaga has been a work in progress since &#8217;05. Paparazzi is NOT the brainchild of Fusari. Sorry. I can&#8217;t go into detail, but It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s 100% LG&#8217;s. I would know, I was there when she thought of it, at a restaurant, I was waiting on her, a friend and her little sis. LOL. And sure, you can find contradictions in anything if you look hard enough. Haven&#8217;t you ever been hypocritical or contradictory? Just cos some are on a pedestal as a star doesn&#8217;t make them exempt from lack of perfection. I applaud your efforts in writing this short essay for your psych class, or whatever. But when you are able to move the world, empower the &#8216;self&#8217;, and spread joy (music), then maybe your criticisms will hold some validity. Are you aware of the suicide rate in gay teens? LG, in her own way, seems to shed light on some of our social dysfunctions with song. We&#8217;ve come to far in our existence to let others define who we are instead of defining it ourselves. Hats off to LG for having the proverbial balls to keep on keeping on, despite such criticisms.</p>

<p>hmm.. What, exactly, has lady Gaga done for gay suicide teens? Come on.. I see it the other way around.. she is CAPITALIZING on young people who feel weak (gays and others) so that they can buy her music. It&#8217;s very transparent. At least Madonna had great pop songs to go along with the pro-gay thing (in the 80&#8242;s no less &#8211; can&#8217;t think of a worse time to be gay in the 20th century.. and she was there with us) and Madonna wasn&#8217;t so terribly obvious about it &#8211; Lady Gaga makes her fans call themselves Little Monsters who need her. Please. She is disgusting</p>

<p>Its particularly sad that we have these IDIOTS around. FIRSTLY WE HAVE LADY GAGA WHOS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED SHE HAS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND HOW TOTALLY UNSUITABLE SHE WOULD BE TO LEAD SOMEANY KIND OF MOVEMENT. Then worst of all we have vile raddled rich bitches from ark music freeloading on pop works doing no useful purpose. totally destroying pop music</p>

<p>that&#8217;s right. she probably doesn&#8217;t care. but that doesn&#8217;t take away the fact that she is the worst representation of pop culture today&#8230; boring, cheap, unoriginal and way too safe..</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pop music is currently at worst possible state. Competition for the top is at the highest rate and only the best out of the best survive. Some of the things that are said here are also true &#8211; in a way. The media expect so much from celebrities that they HAVE to get into the top charts or else, they are regarded as a failure. This creates a stress and enoumous pressure that are very difficult for a person to live with. Money is also another issue as rising stars might not have the money to support their dream. Violence, alcoholic problem, abuse between family or self abuse is also another issue that are sometimes brought up. It&#8217;s very difficult situation for a person to be in.</p>
<p>Furthermore, like Alex has said, there are so many ways that you can become famous in a country or internationally but if you slip up, bad credit will zoom round in a blink of an eye and in the end, there&#8217;s no choice except to just hide away or in some cases, give up (suicide) .</p>
<p>The Pop industry is also very into physical appearance and is highly critical of plastic surgery, lack or talent, etc. I really hate to say all this because I work in media myself, but they are rarely encouraging. Celebrities obviously read these comments. Britney Spears was a victim of this.</p>
<p>Britney appeared in the show Mickey Mouse Club (a barney-type disney show that was pretty popular a while back) and gained extreme popularity. Many people were critical about her because, especially in mid-career, she looked quite fake and plastic &#8212; and she was a great dancer but not much of a singer. And there&#8217;s nothing that Media netizens hate more, pretty girls with little or no talent (which is sadly true with many Pop artists, but netizens just go waaaay over the top). Britney couldn&#8217;t handle the stress she received, because it has been revealed that she has a very sensitive and quiet personality which she often hid from the public due to her &#8216;sexy&#8217; star image.</p>
<p>Christina Aguilera.. where to start with her. There are some bad rumors about her childhood and family relationships&#8211; apparently, her father was quite physically abusive towards her mother, which caused her stress from an early age. There is also a rumor that her record label made her work too much ever since she started making music but no one really knows for sure&#8230; But when she first came out she quickly gained popularity; she had a marketable face and could really sing. However, she suffered from depression and insomnia which basically worsened after she made Bionic, and received quite harsh criticism.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga.. she became almost instantly popular, almost since her debut. Almost all of the songs she made became extremely popular, but that started to drift off a little. In fact, there was a space between her second and third albums when she hardly did any work because no one seemed to be bothered about her. She suffered from depression, most likely because she felt like she gave up on the expectations that the general public had of her. But I remember, since I was a big fan of her, I went to her concerts a lot, and she said quite a few depressing things onstage sometimes. Some other factors could have contributed to her disorder but nothing has been confirmed.</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s what&#8217;s funny&#8230; her character in the public eye and in her music is tough, strong-willed, bubbly, and highly optimistic. Because she is portrayed that way so many times, the public perceives her to actually be like that in real life which is totally NOT true.</p>

<p>I love Lady Gaga, as you all should. She spreads love, acceptance, and bravery &#8211; a smart move that I say sells her music. Although, marketing technique or not, she was the one smart enough to do so. And while we &#8220;argue&#8221; about Lady Gaga, her music and motives, we should praise the advocacy work she has done to help the kids who are insecure. Haters hate.</p>

<p>You can admire someone fine but don&#8217;t worship them. And if love, acceptance and bravery are important to you and then you do things to be loving, accepting and brave and it takes more effort than simply following a celebrity. You be an advocate. You help kids who are insecure. Lots of people can be the hero not just the person standing on the stage.</p>

<p>Her entire scheme has been, &#8220;Target, stalk and harass the more popular kids into hitting me back, then accuse them of bullying ME&#8221;.  Whomever she fears and envies, and wishes she could be as famous as, she targets, stalks, mimics and harasses relentlessly, until they finally respond in exasperation and attack back, and she takes the acknowledgment, trumpets it, waves it around, and goes, &#8220;See?  I am now equal to Celebrity XYZ.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a game of this sick bitch.</p>
<p>Target # 1: Madonna<br />
Current target: The Royal Family<br />
Next likely target: The Estate of Michael Jackson</p>
<p>She will not stop until in her eyes she is the fairest and most famous of them all.  And the fact she has Adam Lambert&#8217;s former fans as her Fat, Naive And Retarded Kiss Army doing Black PR for her on every website on the world where her name appears seems to be inching her closer and closer daily to her goal.</p>

<p>People who allow themselves to be called &#8216;Little Monsters&#8217; by a celebrity are behaving like followers who do not have an identity of their own. Nobody has the right to tell you who you are, not &#8216;even&#8217; a singer.  You should define yourself. Fanatical fans remind me of the zombies in &#8220;The Mummy&#8221; chanting &#8216;Imhotep&#8217;. You can like a singer without losing your own identity. Where is your self-respect? Don&#8217;t put anybody above you. Nobody stands over you unless you like being a Renfield, &#8220;master, master or in this case mother monster, mother monster&#8217;.</p>

<p>For crying out loud. Lady Gaga is a music industry creation. She is a fake, a phoney, a fraud and a culture vulture. The public is so easily manipulated it&#8217;s not funny. She&#8217;s an average singer who writes terrible mainstream commercially viable ORDINARY pop songs that aren&#8217;t dissimilar to Frank Stallone, Starship or Europe&#8217;s cheesy &#8220;final countdown.<br />
Her songs are always me, myself, I. All the lyrics are her trying to convince herself that she matters but at the end of the day she is disposable just like all pop culture.<br />
She isn&#8217;t &#8220;real&#8221;, she&#8217;s a fixation of what people want her to be. Her body image issues are a terrible example to young girls. If the video producers and photographers use thinning cameras and photoshop to enhance her like she says they do then where is her courage to stand up and say NO, I don&#8217;t want this. She is not being honest and not being real.<br />
Honestly, she is not original, she is simply doing what thousands of young people do when they experiment and test =boundaries or rebel.</p>
<p>I doubt any of her bullying stories are true, simply manifested to make her victimisation more appealing to her gullible fans, make her seem more human. It&#8217;s an act.<br />
She has no moral compass or she would not blatantly support the animal cruelty trade by wearing fur and meat as &#8220;fashion, as &#8220;art:. In fact i&#8217;m quite sure she is doing this to support her celebrity friends and their fashion enterprises.<br />
Glamourising animal cruelty is abhorrent. </p>
<p>The only reason she advocates for gay rights is because she needs their pink dollar. Madonna, Kylie and others already know this. Lady GaGa is a practicing catholic so why doesn&#8217;t she advocate for abortion rights or welfare rights. Why isn&#8217;t she outspoken about child molesters in the church? Why? Because there&#8217;s no money to be made.<br />
At the end of the day, the pathetic tragedy that is GaGa is all about MONEY! Making money, it&#8217;s all she and the industry she is part of is about, the bottom line.<br />
It&#8217;s not freaken talent that got her where she is, it&#8217;s her middle class upbringing, her education at an elitist/exclusive school, her rich daddy&#8217;s money, the connections and the confidence she has gained from PRIVILEGE. I can tell you now, i have heard far more talented singers and songwriters than gaga but they either lack the funds, support, confidence or security to focus on their passions. They don&#8217;t have time to hone in on their craft because they&#8217;re working some shit dead end job to pay the rent. </p>
<p>Why buy her boring music when you could save yer money instead and help people in need, start your own band, write your own songs (it&#8217;s easy, really it is), get a crappy guitar, change the World, make a difference, be a part of your own community. THINK FOR YOURSELF!<br />
Personally I don&#8217;t give a damn about gaga, we look up to these idols but by focusing on a few &#8220;stars&#8221; we are missing out on the rest of the constellation.<br />
Seriously, live YOUR dreams and don&#8217;t live in the shadows of others.</p>
<p>Just OVER IT already!</p>

<p>Great post, but she didn&#8217;t have a middle class upbringing, her parents are multi-millionaires, she went to an exclusive private school where the Kennedy children went.</p>

<p>Okay so you wrote this on what you think you know about this person who we all call Lady Gaga!  You need to look at this again and not from who you think she is but who she thinks she is!  It&#8217;s called a persona&#8230;umm I think some might call it an alter ego.  Oh, just one thing to research&#8230;.Andy Warhol.   If you know anything about Pop Culture go look at anything to do with Warhol, he created the idea of  Pop Culture and Lady Gaga has picked almost everything from him and his idea&#8217;s.    You&#8217;ve given her way to much credit&#8230;.yes she is briliant and talented but it&#8217;s all been done before Gaga has just pushed Warhols idea of fame a little farther.</p>

<p>Thought about this for a second and you&#8217;ve missed one enormous thing in this article!!!  Check this video out&#8230;.sound board breaks in the middle of her performance and she continues on performing accapella.  Listen to what she says when they try to get her off the stage.  &#8220;I promised them a 30 min set and I&#8217;m not stopping until my song is finished&#8221;  <a href="http://youtu.be/j3pUItwVxyc" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/j3pUItwVxyc</a> This is why her &#8216;monsters&#8217; like her.  You have made this all too difficult. She&#8217;s a true artist and has real talent.  That is Lady Gaga.  People see this, why haven&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>Are u for real? Ok. It is obvious that you are Britney Fan all the way. I dont judge you for that cause I like most of her music. Trashing Gaga is a stupid thing to do. Do you actually know her? Have you met her? Do you know what goes to her mind? Or what she does or how she does it? If you do then start criticizing. First of all Everyone knows that Gaga is a Persona she made up! You can see it in the evolution of her albums. She took acting and theather classes, she lives for that. Have you been to any of her concerts? She Puts on a Show! She makes a Play with her Concert. She has a theme and everything. Now&#8230; How do you know that Stefanni wasnt like Gaga? Or that she felt the need to be how she is right Now? I personally want to dress differently and do things I&#8217;ve always wanted to do but you know why i dnt do them? Cuz i dnt have the money to do so. What if Stefani wanted to put on a meat dress to make a statement but didnt have the money to have it made or the popularity to make anyone care? What if she really did call herself ugly and wanted everyone to know that is Ok to be a little insecure and that they&#8217;re are not alone and they have her support? Can you answer me all of those questions? But thats the Thing You only Know Half of Her. Becuz u only see Half of it!</p>

<p>I just read the public letter this woman wrote to Kelly Osbourne. Not only is Gaga a joke that&#8217;s gone on for too long and a bad Madonna Karaoke act, but she is dangerous too. She has this cult like hold over millions of rejected souls and encourages them to attack other celebrities that may be a threat or may have commented on her.. She is a new breed of superstar.. she needs to go away</p>

<p>Wow Gaga´s vagina is more wiser than you. She made everything clear in her letter for Kelly and she had a perfectly good reason sending it to her. GAGA IS AGAINST BULLYING you dumb fuck. It´s true that some of the Monsters don´t get that and bully on other singers but hey every fanbase has it´s own crazes and not just us. I´d call those Monsters ˝fake Monsters˝ because they even bashed on Gaga when she gained few pounds. Oh and you must have been living under a rock because Gaga is vocally a 374382748938247 better singer than Madonna is, will ever be, ever was. Just ask Elton, Cher, Sting, Brian May or Mick who she performed with last year with. <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span> At least Gaga got on scene fair she didn´t sucked a shitloads of dicks to get a record deal unlike Madge.</p>

<p>Sorry little mons-turd but you need to shut the fuck up and sit your ass down. Caca is a talentless fraud and little mons-turds are bullying losers. Caca are little mons-turds are a disgrace to the human race.</p>

<p>I am a HUGE fan of Gaga and defend her usually. I don&#8217;t care much for your ramblings in the beginning but that last bit: </p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what the Lady Gaga of 2008 would have to say about the Lady Gaga of 2010. That was the Lady Gaga I once loved: the self-knowing, humble, fun-loving Lady Gaga who I requested at the clubs, rooted for at awards shows, introduced to my friends, inspired me to take fashion risks, and saw in concert. Wherever she is, I want her back. The pop music fans who once rooted for her but just couldn’t swallow the Monster Cult bullshit are still out there. And we are eagerly awaiting her return.&#8221; </p>
<p>I agree 100% I have never liked this whole little monster and mother thing. It&#8217;s weird and a lot of them are calling her mommy/mom/mama &#8211; odd. She was a disco pop dance babe who dressed funky and had she sweetest little personality (pre The Fame and The Fame Era). If you watch the making of pokerface and then bad romance you will see the difference, Pokerface she sweetly tells us about her new video but for bad romance you dont see her talking about it once (suddenly too good to talk to fans?) I&#8217;ll always support her and listen to her music but&#8230;</p>
<p>MONSTER Gaga needs to go, I want LADY Gaga back..</p>
<p>isappointed Fan</p>

<p>This person is ridiculous. The fact that they say that they do understand her is a lie because they also said that if more people understood her, they would embrace her. You need to grow with gaga and get your facts right.</p>

<p>Re-search lmao? Seriously? I´d rather call it a ˝I don´t have a life and im jaleous of Gaga who has succeed in life so now im gonna run a hate blog about how much I hate her˝ blah blah whatever! That´s just pathetic. People who don´t know shit about her life go bashing her without knowing her life story. She didn´t get famous for having a famous dad or for being rich, she didn´t get famous because she sucked a bunch of dicks to get on top like Madonna did at the beginning of her career. Love Madge but that´s the truth. Gaga succeed in life because she is actually TALENTED!!! Ya´ll can say what the fuck you want but just the fact that she got to sing with the legend himself Mick Jegger and your fave didn´t proves that she has TALENT. Now stay pressed hon. <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>

<p>Sorry to leave a second post, but I heard a little while ago something about her which really grated on me. A small home business who makes crazy outfits apparently got in touch with Gaga&#8217;s PA, requesting to send a certain outfit to her for her to wear for free, only to say who made it if asked (so the home company could get some publicity) it was worth a try, anyway.<br />
Anywhoo, after no response from Gaga or her PA, the company were all like&#8217; oh okay then nevermind&#8217;. UNTIL a photo emerged of Gaga wearing the EXACT same outfit only not made by the company themself! The PA or Gaga, for some reason, had someone copy the photo of the outfit EXACTLY. Gaga&#8217;s more than known for her copying of stuff, but I mean, howay. The outfit in question isn&#8217;t something you could accidentally replicate without knowing someone else had made it either. I wish I could remember the name of the designer! When I do I&#8217;ll be sure to post on here with a link to the designers&#8217; picture and the picture of Gaga wearing the stolen-idea ripoff.</p>
<p>Gaga supporting creativity, ey?</p>

<p>I think this article is amazing! You really have summed up everything the people outside of the &#8220;monster cult&#8221; think and feel about Lady Gaga. She used to be a humble, fun, dedicated, pop artist, that didn&#8217;t take herself too seriously. Nowadays, she thinks the world still cares about what she does next but in reality she lost us at the meat dress. She attempts to convince the world that she is not like everyone else. She has no idea that separating herself with what makes her human results in losing the general publics interest. She can&#8217;t go anywhere but down because she became too outrageous to the point where it is so predictable its kind of annoying. I want her to succeed but she is just&#8230; boring.</p>

<p>I am typing this on my phone. It will be difficult to type it all out, much less edit it in full. Please excuse what grammar and spelling errors may exist. Sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, she has an ego. She has people behind her. The Gaga persona is manufactured. She admits this though. &#8220;Bad Romance&#8221; is partly about this. She address the artificial prefomance art of the Gaga persona while in her Calderone persona. These aspects of her are no secret to the intelligent fan.<br />
I was hoping I wouldn&#8217;t have to say this, especially since you addressed it early in your essay, but you missed it you didn&#8217;t understand. This isn&#8217;t a mindless fallback. I am specifically addressing your essay as far as I could read it before realizing how uninformed this particular piece is.<br />
 I stopped reading at your description of &#8220;Telephone&#8221;, &#8220;Just Dance&#8221;, and &#8220;Poker Face&#8221;. This is the part where you don&#8217;t get it. All of these songs are about self expression, feminism, and queer empowerment.<br />
This is what she does. Almost all of her songs apear to be lyrically superficial, while in reality  they are allegories for social justice and political discourse. She is an intelectuall hiding behind a fake manufactured persona. Envision the way Batman uses Bruce Wayne. Gaga is her Bruce Wayne. Gaga is the party going distraction. If her message were obvious, would she have been able to sell it to so many? I doubt it. Humans (especially Americans) are shallow consumers. This engeious marketing of social progress is why many of us love her.<br />
Let me give one slightly more specific example: &#8220;Poker Face&#8221;. You said this was about sex. You are not incorrect, however, to say so is a vast oversimplification of a very emotional song. This song is about sexuality. It is about the oppression of queers in a heteronative society. This song is about the pains of being traped in the infamous, proverbial closet. It is about the abuse LGBTQIA people face in everyday life. It is about being with a person you can not love because the culture will not allow it. I find your statement regarding this song to be, at the vet least, distasteful. It undermines queer culture and all she has done for us. I will atempt to read the rest when I am calm but for now this article has come off as less than an intelectual critique and more as a vast misunderstanding of her work and ideologies.</p>

<p>Just the fact that you are a fan of someone who 90% of the times uses play back explains it all so im not gonna waste many of my words on you cause I pitty you actually. :*) The main problem in this whole story is that you think that Gaga is FAKE which she totally isn´t. She just knows what´s selling this days and it´s SEX and being an entertainer as well as a great singer. You´ve done a shitloads of so called ˝re-search˝ and yet you haven´t watched any of her interviews where she explains that Gaga and Stefani are two completely different people. She created the image of Gaga way back when she was having shows with her friend Lady Starlight. Gaga is all about fame, fashion, amazing dance music, being fierce sometimes people would describe her as ˝vulgar˝ but she´s just acting like a strong female that she is. Stefani on the other hand is still that same brown heared daddy´s girl, who loves wearing dresses, eating pasta and singing ballads while playing her piano. But both Gaga and Stefani have 3 things in common and those are TALENT, LOVE and PASSION. I already said this many many times to a bunch of haters that even if you took Gaga´s ˝Gaga˝ image, all of her crazy outfits, wigs, badass songs, dancers and theatricality in general you´d be left with a beautiful Italian hazel eyed girl with bangs, a piano, talent and a passion. And just imagine what would happen if you would just take away Madonna´s and Britney´s theatricality? <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-lol' title='XD'>XD</span> Just imagine? What would you have left? I can´t imagine Madonna nor Brit singing breathtaking ballads while playing the piano because there´s one problem&#8230;.they SUCK AT SINGING!!! Let´s face it we live in a fucked up world when in music industry it´s more interesting to see what will the hit singer wear next instead of what song will he/she get out. And Gaga knows that. That´s why she become ˝Gaga˝. If you knew more about her which you oh so fucking clearly don´t you´d know that Gaga started her career playing in bars and at festivals just by sitting in front of her piano and singing beautiful ballads. But people as fucked up as they are couldn´t appreaciate that so she had to do something to get their attention and so the Lady Gaga was born. Can´t you see that all of this is just a facade? She´s just a fucking entertainer and yet you are here acting like she plans on starting world war 3. She makes a lot of people happy with her music and fun personality, she saved so many young lifes! So why don´t you write about that instead? So my plan to you is just to sit your hating dumb ass down. Plus not all of us are bitchy and hatefull to other singers. 88% of us are good, we just feel overprotective when it comes to her which is perfectly normal since she is our Queen. You really need to get a life honey.</p>

<p>Look kid, the fact that you call her your Queen is one of the things the author finds troubling.  And the fact that you refer to the collective group of of Monsters the way people in cults refer to themselves is a bit troubling.  You love Lady Gaga, her image, her message, her music. That&#8217;s great.  But as you imply by calling her &#8220;just a fucking entertainer&#8221;, she&#8217;s just another human being with talent and passion, who happens to have found success. (You can&#8217;t seriously think their aren&#8217;t more creative &amp; talented musician in the world who just haven&#8217;t found success, can you?).  Just remember that before you blindly jump to defend her bad behavior. </p>
<p>By the way, the author&#8217;s point seems to be that the Lady Gaga person is no longer the person you initially grew to admire. She&#8217;s let the fame and power go to her head. It&#8217;s a perfectly human reaction, but it will always create backlash. And in case of many historical figures, their death.  In Lady Gaga&#8217;s case, diminishing record and concert ticket sales &#8211; and kiddo, you can&#8217;t argue with those numbers.  It happened to Madonna after she went off the rails with her overinflated ego. We&#8217;ll all have to wait and see if she recovers the way Madonna did.</p>

<p>Disagree.. some of the arguments here are pretty solid. This is a woman who hasn&#8217;t done anything original since she started. While claiming to be a visionary to her legion of uneducated impressionable very young kids. I really can&#8217;t recall anyone who has come out of the gate with such disregard for the intellectual property of others as gaga has &#8211; this is lead by her obsession with Madonna but beyond it to Warhol, Queen Ace of Base and many others&#8230; even her name is a &#8220;borrowed&#8221; item.</p>

<p>You are just like every other fucking person out there that started hating her when Born This Way came out. OH NO, THE ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC IS GONE. MUSIC WITH MEANING IS HERE, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO??! If you really liked LG, you would like all of her music, more so of Born This Way since it has meaning behind it and it&#8217;s also fun and poppy. So, go fuck yourself.</p>

<p>great&#8230;fan wars. the ppl that agree with this post think using &#8220;intelligent&#8221; such as envy instead of jealousy makes them top notch cut of meat. they like to degrade others on thier simple vocabulary instead od using factual come backs. then you have the little monsters that just like to curse at people when angry. when it comes down to it they are pop stars..why do we give a fuck? no britney doesnt sing live, dont even argue it because she has been caught wwaayyy too many times but guess what?? that didnt stop me from buying every fucking album she puts out or ever will put out. i mean come on i even bought blackout n like it lol. as for Mother Monster you truly do have to understand her. she admits that she is cocky about her musical abilities because its all she has. she truly does write every note n melody of every song. ahe creates every song on her piano so all her songs initially start acoustically 100% then she runs to her producers and works with them to turn that acoustic into a dance anthem so yes her producers recieve the credit for that instrumental. Gaga leads by example. she doesnt put her finger in ppls face n tell them what she thinks, she reinacts what she dislikes so when ppl say &#8220;wtf Gaga&#8221; she just kinda looks at them and says &#8220;if you dont like the way i acted then let that be a note to yourself to not act that way.&#8221; n if u research her charity work u will see she does a shit ton of it. guys stars are like normal people, they have thier amazing traits, then they have iffy ones, then they have thie  shitty ones. just embrace each other and the artist. i kinda think making money n being a celeb for no reason like kim kardashian is kind of an art form in itself. u just gotta find the right person to appreciate it. who cares who we all prefer as an artist. an artist is only on top until the next bitch comes along and clock in on thier 15 minutes of fame.</p>

<p>hey there and thank you for your info – I have definitely picked up anything new from right here.<br />
I did however expertise some technical issues using this web site, since I experienced to reload the site lots of times<br />
previous to I could get it to load properly. I had been wondering if your web host is OK?<br />
Not that I&#8217;m complaining, but slow loading instances times will very frequently affect your placement in google and could damage your quality score if ads and marketing with Adwords. Well I&#8217;m adding this RSS to my email and<br />
could look out for much more of your respective intriguing content.<br />
Ensure that you update this again soon.</p>

<p>Lady Gaga has been lying to her fans for ages, and steadily eroding her fanbase. Her recent tour was cancelled with a lame excuse, but in reality simply because it wasn&#8217;t selling tickets. Her album was sold off on week one for £0.99 (!!!!) and there were even plans to release it for free. It ended up making a loss for her company. Artpop, silly title, as it&#8217;s already been dubbed Artpoop, has been recorded at least twice so far (thus shelved), but the title must be kept because, stupidly, she had it tattooed on her arm some 15 months ago&#8230;</p>

<p>I honestly dont mean to patronize anyone and im not going to tell you what to like but this is the what I think.</p>
<p>My time is reserved for people with REAL talent. Not people who act like the weirdest thing you&#8217;ve ever seen, COPY OTHER PEOPLES SONGS and try to pass it off as talent and their own.<br />
Im not one of these &#8216;haters&#8217; that people with this kindve opinion seem to be branded as because i love every single form of music from :<br />
Michael Jackson to The Red Hot chillipeppers to Frank Sinatra to James Brown to Dr Dre, Snoop, Eminem, to The Clash to Elvis Presley to Daft Punk to Example To Korn to The Beatles, to Led Zeppelin to Dubstep. ( To those who don&#8217;t know what genre&#8217;s these are this includes Pop, Electro, Rock, Rock &amp; Roll, Hard Rock, Heavy Metal, Jazz, Swing, Hip Hop and R&amp;B,  basically very very different types of music) </p>
<p>My opinion, How the hell does GAGA, BIEBER, MINAJ even compare???? </p>
<p>My time is reserved for people who ARE GOOD. Not just LOOK GOOD.</p>
<p>I am 22 so dont be thinking im some grumpy old man.</p>
<p>Im just upset with whats being classed as talent now.</p>

<p>Lady Gaga is pretty scary. She preys on the very young and impressionable. Using gay people to sell records so blatantly is wrong. Offering psychiatric help to her fans at her concerts is wrong. Copying Madonna multiple times is wrong. Equating herself to Warhol (haus of Gaga = Warhol Factory.. same idea) is wrong. Taking your name from a queen song is wrong. She really needs to go away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pop music fans who once rooted for her but just couldn’t swallow the Monster Cult bullshit are still out there. And we are eagerly awaiting her return.&#8221;</p>
<p>yes,Yes,YES. But sadly, that lady gaga has long disappeared and is now possessed by a delusional egocentric and narcissist who feels that she is &#8220;revolutionary.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agree with most of this. Some of it is a little overanalyzed and frankly a little too butt smoochy to other artists who I dont believe are super talents just relatively entertaining. Im getting a little sick of everyone trying to be freddy mercury and alice cooper. its so tired. I dont think lg has any talent and I sleep through the videos. i cant stand miley cyrus but I like the new video its weird in a good way, minus the friggin twerking, please remove this word from our language now.  The reason lady gaga is so egomaniacal is because she is so insecure. every lover who dumps her is jealous. and she claims her bfs dont want her to be bi because theyre intimidated by that. Oh lord. Please, no threesome with LG and a much better looking chick. And I felt nauseated when she gave her gay marriage speech like slavery had just been abolished.  She supports all the countries that treat gays awfully. Theyll string em up in palestine, tehy have parades in Israel. Same with all the other celebrities and their utterly monolithic politics.</p>

<p>Start with your budget &#8211; how much can you afford to spend, and stick to<br />
it strictly. Planning for a home renovation project should be done in advance.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am about to start a job that the customer&#8217;s home is located in a beautiful historical district in the city.</p>

<p>Regardless to all this analysis, Lady Gaga is a gifted artist, talented singer, and performer. This is exactly what she likes, controversy. Most talented artist that are gifted do, remember Prince. He had haters and worshipers! Controversy was the constant theme. Made him rich and famous and it&#8217;s done the same for Gaga. Gaga&#8217;s video visuals are amazing. Who cares that she&#8217;s way out there. Most ultra creatives are. Weird has always been in fashion when it comes to music. IMHO she&#8217;s simply ahead of the curve, and ain&#8217;t nothin wrong with that.</p>

<p>Lady Gaga is a fraud and a rip off artist and the world is over her now. It&#8217;s nice to see justice done.</p>

<p>Just love them and stop hating . everyone has there path&#8230;. What is yours? Art is art it&#8217;s subjective . grow up please it&#8217;s not a war&#8230; It&#8217;s just art and creativity. If it was you then support would be your advocate &#8230;.. Just buy what you like and stop bashing. What you do is a reflection of your integrity  and you . Don&#8217;t be a back stabber . Especially when you don&#8217;t know personally any of these artists.</p>

<p>Always interested to hear the all side&#8217;s of a story, I decided to read this article to see what non fans think of Gaga. I myself still am a pretty dedicated fan, and disagree with the points that the author makes. None the less, this essay is still on his opinion so I have no right to tell him he is wrong. There&#8217;s really only two problems I have with this article that mostly have to do with the comment section.</p>
<p>1) The argument that her fan base consists of only deluded youth who will follow everything she says, and will attack anyone who thinks different. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m disproof of that aren&#8217;t I? For a few years I have been a huge fan of Gaga, standing up for her whenever I can, but not snapping off the neck of anyone who disagrees. From what I have seen, most of the other Lady Gaga fans that have commented on this essay only prove that stereotype by making fallacious arguments such as &#8220;You&#8217;re only jealous of Gaga&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8217;re just not smart enough to understand her&#8221;. There is very little logic behind your argument, and you worsen the image of Little Monsters than what people already perceive it to be.  </p>
<p>2) The argument of an artist being &#8220;unoriginal&#8221; can be used for about any musician, painter, or average Jane, don&#8217;t you think? </p>
<p>As an aspiring musician myself, I sample other people&#8217;s songs all the time, and make them into my own original music. That makes me unoriginal correct? I use the same instruments, vocal scale, and words as they do, but so far no one has labeled me as an unoriginal music producer. It&#8217;s a bit different since I&#8217;m not famous but take a look at this YouTube video explaining how 36 songs made by 36 completely different, and well known artists, share the same 4 chords. </p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/oOlDewpCfZQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Along with other artists like Usher, Maroon 5, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lady Gaga is featured in the video. My point is not that Gaga&#8217;s originality isn&#8217;t subjective, but if you question one person&#8217;s authenticity don&#8217;t you have to question everyone&#8217;s? </p>
<p>Alright well my thoughts are voiced, I&#8217;m done.</p>

<p>You have it all wrong. It&#8217;s not that Lady Gaga is so insecure as to be like that, it&#8217;s that she thinks that&#8217;s what her Little Monsters want to hear. It&#8217;s the fans that are incredibly petty, arrogant, moral-less, and insecure. Read all of the comments online of late by whiny teenagers. That&#8217;s EXACTLY what they are all like. So Steffanni appeals to this. She is appealing to the lowest common denominator in order to gain attention, fame, and money. It IS a generational thing actually because I don&#8217;t remember us being quite so freaking insecure and mean as teens. We had internet but never used it like they do now. Liking Lady Gaga&#8217;s music is nothing more than an immature excuse for snobbery so that the sad youths in our high schools and middle schools can look down their noses at everybody else and feel they are better. They live through Gaga and her phoney art pop that&#8217;s why they follow her to such lengths(like posting nude photos of themselves on her Twitter). Even Steffanni herself has somewhat admitted this by saying that she was a huge &#8220;study&#8221; of fame and the process of fame. Steffanni was turned down by many many record labels who didn&#8217;t think she was good enough. She had the same problem that Katy Perry and Ke$ha did. Steffanni STUDIED famous pop acts like Madonna to see what it was about a singer that made her famous and came to the conclusion that most people who study music do; it&#8217;s not about the music at all but about how accessable the artist makes herself the the dreams of the fans. That&#8217;s why there is such a blurred line between dream and reality in what Steffanni does. Because it&#8217;s not about reality but about allowing fans to live their dreams of popularity and power through her. This is why she makes such a big deal to appear different than anybody else. Because, as the professed Little Monster will tell you, Lady Gaga is REAL, she makes art, and is a huge fashion statement, and she doesn&#8217;t lip synch at her concerts, and truly cares about her Little Monsters. Thus allowing the Little Monsters to look down their noses at every other singer in the genre. This works because the average teenager is threatened by Britney Spears&#8217; beauty, or Katy Perry&#8217;s popularity. They don&#8217;t feel special inside and don&#8217;t want to listen to the music of anybody that society might deem special. So in a way, the invention that is Lady Gaga truly has turned the tables around and made a place where misfits can feel better than the average it girl who has long perfect hair might like to listen to Ke$ha. And I think that is why Steffanni always has to find a way to keep herself in the spotlight at all times. Because keeping those tables turned is a hard thing to do in an age where there exists things like &#8220;Slut Shaming.&#8221; This doesn&#8217;t bother me. It was a long time coming that our youth would tire of constantly feeling stepped on by pristine pop princesses and society&#8217;s outlook on what people should be. No, what bothers me is that I think Steffanni is using this, and consequently, the peoples she professes to stand up for. I don&#8217;t believe a word of what she says in interviews, or on stage. It&#8217;s all performance and obviously so and yes, much of that performance may just be in order to keep those tables turned. What I don&#8217;t like are the articles where it&#8217;s been reported that she has stolen from a charity she herself set up. Or that she has allowed viscious cyber bullying attacks from her fans to continue on her site.Or the complaints from former personal assistants who have quite because they were horribly mistreated by Steffanni. Or the fact that she is still using copious amounts of illegal drugs. Or the fact that she wears Nazi-like costumes at her concerts. Or that she refused to take down the underaged porn photos from fans that showed up on her Twitter account and so many many things like that. No, in all accounts, Steffanni is not a very nice person and she seems to be able to slip under the radar quite nicely because of this Lady Gaga gig she has going. What gets me the most is how much of a user she is and how many people there are in the world who are fragile enough to fall for her charade and be used. It is painful to me watch young ones get taken advantage of by somebody, who for all accounts, is nothing more than a needy, drug addicted, ex stripper.</p>

<p>So true she copies Madonna Cher and anyone else who is talented, she was a no body who even her teachers said she was a no one. You can she by the way she dressed before she got her fan base that this is not who she is she craves attention but does not like anyone else getting any that is why is targeted an audience that she knew with a little I love you meaning the lgbt and misfits that they would gravitate to her and think she really cares. I never here of her giving back to the community or donating time or money to these groups she just wants them there. By the way who would want to be known as a monster that sounds like a creepy person. Everything she does has been done before so she will have to get over it most of the time she looks like an idiot. But they paved her way to financial freedom real quick. She sure is a homely looking girl and she only makes it worst with the ugly so called style of hers. She needs to go crawl under a rock she will never be pretty like Brittney.</p>

<p>That last paragraph is perfect. I used to love Lady Gaga, went to the monster ball AND the btw ball. Then I previewed Artpop on iTunes the day before it&#8217;s official release. I&#8217;ve never been so disappointed in my life. This woman went on and on and on about how good artpop was going to be. And it is pure garbage. I couldn&#8217;t wait for each song to come to an end, hoping it would get better on the next song. Nope. It kept getting worse. And that very day, I become completely detached from any positive thoughts I had of her and something strange happened &#8211; I could now only see her in the same way that the &#8220;haters&#8221; do. I never considered myself a &#8220;monster&#8221; because that&#8217;s just fucking lame. But now, her stupid antics and lies and overhype and now the overwhelming hypocrisy, she&#8217;s a joke. And I can honestly I absolutely hate her and I&#8217;m embarrassed for ever having liked her in the first place. I totally let the bitch dupe me. And she&#8217;s duping all of you who worship her. It&#8217;s pathetic.</p>

<p>Who wrote this bitter, pretentious, pompous, self-important &#8216;essay&#8217;? Madonna?</p>
<p>You are scraping around for reasons to knock Gaga, which are all built on next to nothing except your own wishy-washy opinion mostly. There are so many hypocrisies here, it is unbelievable, and hard to know where to start. Are the name she gives her fans and the fact she tells the world she doesn&#8217;t lip synch REALLY an issue?</p>
<p>As for the &#8216;what star does lip synch?&#8217; claim, well I will name one for a start, and it is a HUGE one&#8230;.MADONNA.</p>
<p>If you are going to get on your high horse about that subject, then get on it about that woman and how &#8216;fraudulent&#8217; she is.</p>
<p>I saw her &#8216;Who&#8217;s that girl?&#8217; tour back in 1987 at Wembley Stadium in London. She lip synched throughout the entire &#8216;live&#8217; performance, and that was early in here career when you would think her &#8216;vocal talents&#8217; had far more to offer!</p>
<p>To claim that nobody lip sychs, and everyone gives it a shot regardless of their vocal talents is a lie, and I take a lot of exception to that statement when a global star like Madonna has done it for years, and has held a much more long term influence and standing than Gaga has (so far)</p>
<p>Rant about her.</p>
<p>As for the statement&#8217; our sexual orientation is not a central part of our identity&#8217; then what the hell are the worldwide &#8216;gay pride&#8217; parades and days all about?</p>
<p>If your sexual persuasion is not an issue, no big deal, etc. etc., then why feel the need to dance up and down on a podium and tell the world about it? I am not a homophobe or have any issue whatsoever about anybody&#8217;s sexual proclivity (to be honest, is someone finds sheep attractive, I couldn&#8217;t care less) but what annoys me intensely is when gay people rant that they don&#8217;t want to be patronised or their sexual orientation to be made an issue, but then make a big song and dance about it all the time, banner-brandishing,  telling the world they are out and proud?</p>
<p>Frankly, who cares? I am hetero. Does anyone care? Umm no.</p>
<p>This is why I take issue with YOU taking issue with Gaga for vocally supporting gay rights. So it is not ok for her to &#8216;patronise&#8217; you by supporting and talking about gay rights, but it is ok for you to make a big deal about it yourselves?</p>
<p>Hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I am sad to say that in my opinion, this whole essay really just comes across as a bitchy put down to somebody who is very talented and deserves to be where she is now. </p>
<p>It smacks of pure nit-picking, nothing more.</p>

<p>In the beginning of her career i didn&#8217;t really think much of her, but i was drawn to artpop and from there just started listening to most of her songs. I feel that this article is a bit bias, but i think that its important to understand the her fans. Being one of her fans, I chose to continue to be loyal because of what i have seen on her live performances, interviews, etc. And this loyalty that i feel, and that many other little monsters feel, towards her can be compared to what other passionate, mature, madonna fans might have.<br />
I think that a lot of us are in it for the &#8220;FEELS&#8221; and lets face it we liked being entertained. Even if it were a lie, it would be a pretty sweet lie because in the end she made this whole musical adventure very positive, unique, and probably just as wild as back in the days. As for the fake charity aid that you mentioned,I would like to see where you found that article.<br />
 p.s. its really late so excuse my grammer mistakes- if i have any.</p>

<p>THANK YOU! Lady Gaga as the &#8216; voice of the gay community&#8217; as a member of the gay community, I&#8217;m offended by that. If you want respect act respectful. Period. She epitomizes the negative stereotype that we strive to break free of. Her cult is just angry as the large words in the first few sentences lost them. They only understand stuttering. Hahahaha</p>
