This Non-Religious Life
Play Every Thurs at 8pm Eastern is 'This Non-Religious Life' hosted by Ken, Bob and Jason.'This Non-Religious Life' is a weekly one hour show with new episodes debuting every Thursday at 8 pm ET. The show, hosted by me, Ken, alongside my co-hosts Jason and Bob, seeks to highlight particular aspects of religious faith and the irreligious movement. The show will contain interviews with apologists/secularists, discussions about recent events, reviews of books/documentaries and all things free-thought related. Starting with the most common religion in the US, Christianity, this show will explore the key values, texts, and claims made by various denominations. Over time the show will move on to explore a variety of world religions including the claims of Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, New Age/Wicca, and Hindu beliefs. All aspects of the religious claims will be examined from a secular perspective to highlight their issues, canons, and of course, the many absurdities contained within. If you have any questions, comments or outbursts please feel free to contact us by email ( NonReligious{at}Zombie-Popcorn.com ) or on the Zombie Popcorn Hotline: 757-337-2195

The New Architects
Play http://zombie-popcorn.comThe New Architects is a project of a new structure to give a new light on an old subject -- Anarchy.Over the years, the teachings and actions of those who believe have been removed from the mainstream thought and covered with misinformation and/or labeled as 'punk'.The many levels of Anarchy reach further than one culture or lifestyle. There is a rich, deep history that is being lost along with the works of individuals and groups, from around the world, who strive to improve their lives and the lives of the people (and animals) around them.It is the goal of 'The New Architects' to seek out individuals and groups who work, in their everyday lives, to bring forth the ideas of what is defined as Anarchy and open up a dialogue between people in hope to inspire others.As the definition of what anarchy is will differ from person to person, it is not our goal to give a definition but to give strength and inspiration to those who work to improve a system that is broken.The New Architects are individuals and communities that make a difference in the way we view the world.The people behind the idea of this site are; * Thomas Barnett is an American singer-songwriter born in Richmond, Virginia. He is best known for being the singer for the melodic hardcore band Strike Anywhere. Barnett has been the vocalist for the band since its formation in 1999. He was also the vocalist for the band Inquisition until its disbanding in 1996.Thomas is a strong supporter for animal rights and is vegan. * Jason Bayless is the founder of Zombie Popcorn, Zombie Popcorn Radio and several other Zombie Popcorn related projects. He has a long history of activist work, including but not limited to, animal rights, human rights, earth rights. To read more you can visit Jason's profile at Zombie-Popcorn.com Jason is vegan and a strong supporter of anyone who is working for a better world.
