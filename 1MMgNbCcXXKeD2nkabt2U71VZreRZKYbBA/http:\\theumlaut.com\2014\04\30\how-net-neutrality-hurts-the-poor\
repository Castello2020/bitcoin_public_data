								<span class="dropcap">W</span>ho would ever drink Walmart-brand Scotch? It sounded disgusting to me when my micro professor first used the prospect of this &#8220;beverage&#8221; as an illustration of a more general proposition: &#8220;Low-quality X is part of the optimal stock of X.&#8221;</p>
<p>This principle is easy for the relatively well-off to forget. I have no interest in drinking low-quality Scotch, but many people in the world may be able to afford nothing better. Rules that remove low-quality Scotch from the marketplace make those people worse off. It&#8217;s true, the rules may protect those who want only high-quality Scotch: Go to the store and buy any bottle—if mediocre Scotch is banned, then any bottle you pick will be a good one. But this protection for the rich is provided at the expense of the poor. Before we ban low-quality products from the marketplace, we might, as they say, check our privilege.</p>
<p>Low-quality Scotch is part of the optimal stock of Scotch. Not everyone can afford a Mercedes: Low-quality cars are part of the optimal stock of cars. Sometimes all you need is really basic medical advice: Low-quality doctors (and non-doctors!) are part of the optimal stock of doctors. Maybe <a href="https://www.ij.org/utah-hairbraiding">you just need to get your hair braided</a>, and you don&#8217;t need your stylist to know how to do other things: Low-quality stylists are part of the optimal stock of stylists.</p>
<p>I recalled this early economics lesson when I attended <a href="http://netmundial.org/">NETmundial</a>, the global Internet governance meeting that took place last week in Brazil. A large contingent of civil society participants was deeply upset that the meeting&#8217;s final output document did not include the global net neutrality mandate it had been pushing for. It was concerning that nobody seemed to realize that this measure would reduce access to the Internet for the world&#8217;s poorest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/523736/around-the-world-net-neutrality-is-not-a-reality/">In much of the world, the net is not neutral</a>, thanks to companies like Facebook and Google. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/fast-and-free-facebook-mobile-access-with-0facebookcom/391295167130">Facebook Zero</a> is an initiative launched in 2010 to give customers of 50 carriers, mostly in the developing world, access to a lightweight version of Facebook on their WAP-enabled feature phones at no charge. Users can post, like, poke, and comment to their hearts&#8217; content, but if they want to view photos or access non-Facebook sites, they incur the usual data charge. The model has been so successful at <a href="http://qz.com/5180/facebooks-plan-to-find-its-next-billion-users-convince-them-the-internet-and-facebook-are-the-same/">growing Facebook adoption in Africa</a> that Google followed suit with a competing offering, <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/mobile/landing/freezone/">Google Free Zone</a> in 2012. Lest anyone think that this is a cruel ploy by evil, for-profit corporations to trap the poor inside their walled gardens, the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation also copied Facebook&#8217;s idea with <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero">Wikipedia Zero</a>, to great effect.</p>
<p>You may think that walled-garden access to Facebook or Google is inferior to neutral Internet access—and you&#8217;d be right. But if the neutralistas got their way, people in developing countries wouldn&#8217;t have better Internet access; many of them would have nothing. Wikimedia <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero">notes</a> that in Kenya, mobile service costs can exceed 25 percent of monthly income. &#8220;Additionally, nearly 1 in 5 have reported that they will forgo a usual expenditure (such as food) in order to reload phone credit.&#8221; Low-quality (free) Internet access, therefore, is part of the optimal stock of Internet access.</p>
<p>As if it weren&#8217;t enough to connect the world&#8217;s poorest for the first time, non-neutrality can also help to fund necessary network buildouts on an ongoing basis. By giving access to Facebook, Google, and Wikipedia away as a loss-leader, carriers are serving with their basic tier of service those who can&#8217;t afford more, and habituating those who <em>can</em> afford to click beyond the walled garden to using the mobile web. This price discrimination not only increases access but also raises more revenue than a neutral strategy would. Developing-world carriers <em>need</em> that revenue if they ever intend to build the kinds of networks that will support widespread Internet use. Net neutrality, in other words, would not only keep the poorest offline, it would keep investment in poor-country telecom infrastructure down for longer.</p>
<p>A similar, but less stark, dynamic is playing out in rich countries. Anyone who has ever used their Kindle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-3G-Ereader/dp/B00BTI6HBS/?tag=theumlaut-20">included 3G service</a> has benefited from network non-neutrality; after all, you can&#8217;t use it to access non-Amazon services. Absent Amazon&#8217;s non-neutral arrangement with wireless carriers, you&#8217;d have to pay a nontrivial monthly fee to access books via the cellular network, which would mean that most people would forgo cellular and stick to Wi-Fi. Again, we observe a non-neutral arrangement expanding access and saving people money.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at NETmundial, harder heads (and deeper pockets) prevailed, and the net neutrality mandate was stripped from the <a href="http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf">outcome document</a>, not without much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Despite their setback, stakeholders have vowed to continue pressing the issue in other international fora. While I am saddened by their <em>I-want-a-pony</em> understanding of economic tradeoffs, one has to admire their determination. Perhaps at the next gathering I will have to buy them a round of Walmart Scotch.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot less interest in regulating Kindle&#8217;s whispernet because not using it at all is a perfectly sensible response. If you don&#8217;t like your local cable company&#8217;s policies, you&#8217;re often out of choices.</p>

<p>I suspect, from your question to @achatham:disqus, that Africa doesn&#8217;t have better carrier competition than the US. (By the way, if your research for this post has given you the answer, please don&#8217;t leave us in suspense.)</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be level-headed about this. None of us are interested in the outcome of a race-to-the-bottom strategy. We know how that ends.</p>
<p>The citizens of the 50+ countries in Africa would certainly like a competitive situation in their voice and data carrier markets, and a robust and intercoupled framework of laws, regulations, and court decisions that establish and defend such an economically valuable state of affairs. </p>
<p>That they don&#8217;t yet have it in even their largest countries (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt), let alone their smallest ones (Seychelles, Sao Tome, Cape Verde), is no reason for us to praise this condition and seek to model our efforts on theirs.</p>

<p>Many without a technical understanding of the Internet may not know how many different actual networks their information will pass through. All of the examples of XXX Zero are of companies contracting directly with the company that provides service directly to the customer. </p>
<p>While the systems are designed to be as efficient as possible, your request for something around the corner could go around the world. Passing through many different networks. Each of these networks, for the most part, treat your data the same as the president&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Should each of these networks start setting up toll booths, your access could be slow because Facebook didn&#8217;t pay off a company in France, even if you live in the US.</p>
<p>Part of the price for allowing all these different networks to work together so successfully is that up to this point most have allowed their networks to be neutral.</p>

<p>Net neutrality has *nothing whatsoever* to do with access. Especially access for poor users.  It has to do with service providers being treated equally and fairly on the *infrastructure* that allows users access to those services. </p>
<p>Is low quality electricity part of the optimal stock of electricity? Is low quality water in a municipal system part of the optimal stock of water? </p>
<p>How about low quality roads? Net neutrality means that the speed limit applies equally, to everybody using the roads. Non-net neutrality means that Fed-Ex, UPS, and DHL can pay a lot of money to always get to drive 100mph and use the HOV lanes. Can an upstart delivery service compete with that if they can afford the tolls?</p>
<p>Your analogy does not fit and appears to be telecom industry astroturfing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not too sure I understand the road analogy. Fed-Ex, UPS, etc. already exploit their scale to reduce costs. They have massive distribution networks, expensive algorithms, etc. that are already make it very difficult for a new delivery service to compete. I don&#8217;t think you would suggest that, for example, Fed-Ex should not be allowed to use expensive algorithms that optimize shipping routes because a new company would not be able to afford the development cost of those algorithms.</p>

But the *roads themselves* are an even playing field. Net neutrality is about prioritizing traffic on the roads of the internet, and allowing people to pay more so that their cars (traffic) has a higher priority.  And its not just that the people paying will get better priority, the converse is that the people who are *not* paying will get *lower* priority, because bandwidth is not an unlimited resource.  In this case Poor people will certainly be able to access expensive services, but poor *services* will get screwed, and the internet will look less and less like a place where everybody has a voice, and more and more like a few limited, controlled channels of information.</p>
<p>Take wikipedia for example. They currently have to beg for money just to stay in operation, yet its in the top 10 most visited sites on the internet.  Will access to wikipedia be worse if they need to pay to allow their customers to access their site?</p>
<p>In any case, the internet has functioned perfectly well for the last 40 years with totally neutral traffic priorities. Now, companies like Comcast would like to make their customers pay them to access netflix, and want netflix to pay them to allow their customers to have an acceptable experience.   There is *nothing* going on here except a craven cash grab by some ISPs.</p>

<p>Also, Eli&#8217;s example holds, because, under net neutrality as usually understood, you wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to charge $0 for some data (e.g. the Facebook, Google, and Wiki products) charge &gt;$0 for others.  That would be non-neutral pipes, so to speak.  Exceptions for this traditional definition of neutrality are often made for mobile networks, as you likely know, because, unsurprisingly, companies like to be able to charge for massively capital intensive and forward-looking investments.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia example is interesting, because people usually only trot out Netflix. I suspect Wikipedia will do just fine, it has a loyal user base that would be quite unhappy if any paywalls were to be erected.  (It is also not nearly as destitute as you think!)</p>
<p>Lastly, Netflix is what % of internet data traffic in the U.S?  20% 30% 30%+  Does Netflix bear 20% of internet data traffic costs?  30%?  30% * (1 &#8211; discount)?   Nowhere close.  If you are a Comcast customer and not a Netflix customer&#8230;.you&#8217;re still paying for it.</p>

<p>Google and Facebook in these examples are doing the subsidizing, because their business model is to *sell* access to the people that use their services. They sell advertising. That is their mission. Their consumers are the product.  It fits their mission to get as many people on their service as they can, so they sell more ads. In that particular case, the people using those services are the product that google and Facebook are selling.  </p>
<p>The author, in a disingenuous attempt to make it seem like &#8220;wikipedia is doing the same thing&#8221; is creating a nonsense argument that because a noble organization is giving away content for free, it follows that all organizations giving away content for free are noble. Wikipedia says &#8220;The objective of the program is to reduce barriers to accessing free knowledge—one of the largest barriers being cost of data usage&#8221; So while both of them are doing the same thing their motivations in doing so are wildly different.</p>
<p>Finally, netflix accounts for 33% of the internet traffic on an average night in the US.  And no, netflix isnt paying for 1/3 of the internet traffic.  That would only be fair if everybody had free access to the internet and the only people who had to pay were the service providers. But that isnt how it works. 1/3 of the US *has* paid for their bandwidth, they&#8217;ve paid comcast already, and are choosing to use it to access netflix&#8217;s servers.  Comcast simply wants to charge their customers to get access to netflix *and simultaneously* charge netflix to get access to those same customers.  So yes that 1/3 of the internet *is* paid for by netflix.  Its a big part of why people are paying comcast for high speed service in the first place.</p>

This is data discrimination as packets aren&#8217;t being &#8220;treated&#8221; equally by the ISP as far as I see it.  If users were paying $20 for internet access, then Facebook can choose to put a price on its own product of course.  Newspapers can choose to erect paywalls and make users pay for their &#8220;data.&#8221;  It is not the ISP that is distinguishing between packets in this case, and you have already paid the ISP.  In Eli&#8217;s example, it is the ISP that is charging $0 and positive $, and so how would this not run afoul of most net neutrality agreements?  Could Comcast (who is still legally bound by net neutrality) come up with a plan where all data was charged at $XYZ/GB except for Facebook and Google usage?  Would this have flown under the old net neutrality rules?  Can Comcast say NBC-related data packets are free but ABC-related packets incur a charge?  </p>
<p>On the Netflix point, let me rephrase this.  Does the Netflix community (Netflix + its viewers) incur 1/3 of the costs associated with transporting U.S. data?  Of course not.  Yes they have paid for internet access&#8230;.but can you say they have paid for that &#8220;bandwidth.&#8221;?  Most have paid for a speed with a variable amount of bandwidth.  They can throw their computer in the garbage and still pay $40/month, consuming 0 data or watch Netflix 14 hours a day and pay $40/month consuming huge amounts of data.  It is as if you and I pay $100 in taxes/year for access to highways and you own a trucking fleet with 15 vehicles and all I do is commute 5 days a week in a sedan.  You say, look, I paid for this bandwidth!  Yet we paid the same&#8230;.and whoever maintains the highway is going to have to charge somebody&#8230;.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1672" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Facebook and Google are subsidizing their &#8216;zero&#8217; products, because facebook&#8217;s product is not a social network and google&#8217;s product is not a search engine. Their products are adversiting platforms. Thats how they get paid. But the packets going into and out of those networks are being treated equally. Whether the user is paying, or using a free service like the zero products, that packet has the same speed, reliability and priority.  </p>
<p>&#8220;but can you say they have paid for that &#8220;bandwidth.&#8221; &#8211; Yes absolutely. Your internet access plan is measured in bits per second. if you have a 10Mbs plan, you are entitled to use 10Mbs for the whole month you have that plan which would be about 3.2 Terabytes of data per month. ISP&#8217;s bank on the fact that you&#8217;re never going to use that much data and therefore oversell their circuits well beyond what anybody is actually entitled to.  Once services emerged that people wanted to use, like Netflix and YouTube, the ISP&#8217;s had to adjust how much they can oversell their networks because people started to actually use what they were sold, eating into their profits. So in an attempt to get back to the good old days of printing money, they are trying to claw it back from the service providers.  That and they put data caps on their customers, which generally causes customer revolt. But since they have an infrastructure monopoly, they dont very much have to care if their customers revolt, because they dont have any other choices.</p>
<p>So this is a direct result of their pricing model, which is their own hole that they dug. Instead of metered bandwidth where you pay for what you use (back in the ol&#8217; 600 minutes of AOL days), now they have &#8220;unlimited&#8221; which is really actually limited, they just guess at what your limits are and price accordingly.  The mobile carriers figured this out *really* fast and dropped their &#8216;unlimited data&#8217; plans. (Im still clinging to my grandfathered plan from my first iphone).</p>

<p>But on the Facebook / Google topic.. those packets are treated the same at the infrastructure level, I get that.  And I am well aware of these companies business models.   But, in Eli&#8217;s example, it is the ISP that is doing the pricing.  So, I maintain, can Comcast announce on Monday that all Facebook data is free (with or w/o Facebook subsidizing)?  Can Comcast say all NBC data is free (they&#8217;d be subsidizing) but all competitors data is not.  Or would this run afoul of the FCC&#8217;s net neutrality rules they are bound by.  If this runs afoul then Eli&#8217;s example holds 100% because the generally understood net neutrality agreements that are being lobbied for in his article have many angles, one of which would outlaw these types of agreements, right?  It&#8217;s not slower/faster pipes here, that&#8217;s correct, it&#8217;s effectively data packet price discrimination based on function.</p>

Consumer choice would no longer be &#8220;which site do I want to use&#8221; it would be &#8220;netflix sucks, amazon sucks, and upstart video content producer X is absolutely terrible, I guess I&#8217;ll just watch NBC.</p>
<p>This is as if we allowed Walmart to buy roads and deliberately put potholes in the ones that lead to Cosco.  We dont allow that, just like we should not allow network prioritization to prevent us from choosing what services we want to consume.</p>

<p>Wikipedia already pays a lot for customers to access their site by paying developers, server costs, etc.. Allowing ISPs to charge Wikipedia would undoubtedly be bad for Wikipedia. But If your support for net neutrality stems from a desire to make &#8220;poor&#8221; services more financially feasible, would you also support a policy like government subsidies for servers, that would have the same financial effect on these firms?</p>
<p>Also, would you support a policy on server companies that only allows them to sell one level of server (not faster/slower servers for higher/lower prices)? Right now Facebook can purchase better servers than a start up. If we want to ban them from purchasing &#8220;better&#8221; bandwidth, should we also prevent them from purchasing better hardware?</p>
<p>Thanks again for taking the time to respond. I&#8217;m not trying to be antagonistic &#8212; just trying to understand this position.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1662" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The difference here is a fundamental miscategorization of what network bandwidth really is. It is being treated and compared as if it were a product, when in fact, it is a resource, and really ought to be public in the first place.</p>
<p>Would you support a policy that allowed people to buy up priority on roads? with subsidies for poor people so that they can at least get to work?</p>
<p>Right now, the last, final, ultimate place that we have that is not completely owned by wealthy oligarchs is the network. Even that is being consolidated and merged into too few hands (ie. the comcast/time warner merger). We have a policy that recently changed here the states that said &#8220;money is speech&#8221;, and the corporations have free speech rights.  So we have a policy where they can buy up politicians, and the poor no longer have any representation.  We have seen how if you spend enough money on lawyers, you get the fast lane in the justice system. No money? You&#8217;re gonna rot in jail.</p>
<p>So now, if you allow the corporations to sell access to their customers to the highest bidder, I can guarantee that the information available to their customers (who are paying them for access) will become limited by what the service providers have been willing to pay.</p>

For example, Google would approach TimeWarner and say &#8220;I won&#8217;t work with you if you allow Facebook through your pipes?&#8221;  Our antitrust laws might be suitable to prevent these types of exclusive dealings &#8211; but maybe not.</p>
<p>Or, moreover, is the issue that ComCast would not host any TimeWarner websites (or that ComCast would force TimeWarner websites to use the slower pipe)?</p>
<p>I agree that there could be an issue if Google became a provider and controlled the content that flowed through their pipes.  There would be a plausible antitrust claim that Google would be using its monopoly in search to acquire a monopoly in an adjacent market.</p>

Because they have so many trucks going in and out of that road all the time, it always needs to be repaired. Net neutrality would prevent UPS from being charged for that repair, and instead distribute the cost to everyone, meaning that people who order from UPS receive a disproportionate amount of road repair funding. The problem is that if UPS can be charged for the road repair, who&#8217;s to say that won&#8217;t quickly lead to extortion? It is a difficult question to answer, but Net Neutrality is definitely not as cut and dried as people try to make it.</p>

<p>Net neutrality would not at all prevent UPS from being charged for that repair.  Because in this situation, UPS = netflix, and the roads = their upstream network provider.</p>
<p>It would prevent UPS from being charged to use the roads that *lead to their customers homes* when the customers have paid for their half of the roads.</p>
<p>It is cut and dried. Last mile internet service providers failed to anticipate that their users would want to use what they were sold, their profits arent as large as they were predicting, and they want Netflix to pay for access to those customers. If customers were watching the same amount of video content, but it just so happened to come from 500 different video providers (instead of just netflix/amazon/youtube), The last mile providers would *still* have to beef up their side of the bargain. But they dont want to. They want to resell content (netflix) to their customers, and they want to sell their customers to netflix.   This is what they do *now* with their television rights, and they want to extend that to the internet.</p>
<p>Viacom had to pay DirectTV for access to their customers, and thats the model that the last mile providers want to keep maintaining. Unfortunately the last mile providers only own the delivery infrastructure, not the whole internet, so their archaic, consumer hating business model needs to go.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-1741" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;m trying to understand your point of view, but you often make a point of net neutrality doing something without explaining how. For example, </p>
<p>&#8220;You may think that walled-garden access to Facebook or Google is inferior to neutral Internet access—and you’d be right. But if the neutralistas got their way, people in developing countries wouldn’t have better Internet access; many of them would have nothing.&#8221; </p>
<p>Can you explain how neutalists would stop people from getting access to the internet?</p>
<p>I think you mean to say that if an international ISP can charge Facebook for access, than that ISP can use the extra funding for growth. But, in your linked article, &#8220;Around the World, Net Neutrality Is Not a Reality&#8221;, the free usage leads to increased data usage and data revenue. </p>
<p>With the major issue in those countries being that the poor cannot afford internet, free lightweight versions of Facebook and Google have shown to promote internet usage and data revenue. Wouldn&#8217;t free lightweight Facebook be the &#8220;Cheap Scotch&#8221;? </p>
<p>I do understand that Facebook and Google providing these lightweight versions definately hurts competing social or search function websites, but I don&#8217;t understand how they can hurt ISPs. </p>
<p>The walled-garden is the &#8220;Cheap Scotch&#8221; right? But, from my understanding, if an international ISP charges Facebook for access to poor people, wouldn&#8217;t that make it harder for Facebook, Google, and Wiki to provide a free version? </p>
<p>Either these ISPs will charge websites for access, and it will generate extra revenue for the ISP, Facebook, Wiki, and google may or may not still provide free versions. Or ISPs won&#8217;t charge websites for access and they will continue to offer free lightwieght versions, and drive usage and data revenue. </p>
<p>I read the other articles you linked, &#8220;Around the World, Net Neutrality Is Not a Reality&#8221; is about international consumers not being able to afford internet, and so net neutrality is a moot point. The other &#8220;Facebook and Google Create Walled Gardens for web newcomers overseas&#8221;, is about free &#8220;Cheap Scotch&#8221; versions of the internet. Neither article supports your view. </p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
