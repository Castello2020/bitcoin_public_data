								<span class="dropcap">N</span>obel laureate, Princeton economics professor, and <em>New York Times</em> columnist Paul Krugman is a brilliant man. I am not so brilliant. So when Krugman makes strident claims about macroeconomics, a complex subject on which he has significantly more expertise than I do, should I just accept them? How should we evaluate the claims of people much smarter than ourselves?</p>
<p>A starting point for thinking about this question is the work of another Nobelist, Robert Aumann. In 1976, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2958591">Aumann showed</a> that under certain strong assumptions, disagreement on questions of fact is irrational. Suppose that Krugman and I have read all the same papers about macroeconomics, and we have access to all the same macroeconomic data. Suppose further that we agree that Krugman is smarter than I am. All it should take, according to Aumann, for our beliefs to converge is for us to exchange our views. If we have common &#8220;priors&#8221; and we are mutually aware of each others&#8217; views, then if we do not agree <em>ex post</em>, at least one of us is being irrational.</p>
<p>It seems natural to conclude, given these facts, that if Krugman and I disagree, the fault lies with me. After all, he is much smarter than I am, so shouldn&#8217;t I converge much more to his view than he does to mine?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. One problem is that if I change my belief to match Krugman&#8217;s, I would still disagree with a lot of really smart people, including many people as smart as or possibly even smarter than Krugman. These people have read the same macroeconomics literature that Krugman and I have, and they have access to the same data. So the fact that they <em>all</em> disagree with each other on some margin suggests that very few of them behave according to the theory of disagreement. There must be some <em>systematic</em> problem with the beliefs of macroeconomists.</p>
<p>In their <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">paper on disagreement</a>, Tyler Cowen and Robin Hanson grapple with the problem of self-deception. Self-favoring priors, they note, can help to serve other functions besides arriving at the truth. People who &#8220;irrationally&#8221; believe in themselves are often more successful than those who do not. Because pursuit of the truth is often irrelevant in evolutionary competition, humans have an evolved tendency to hold self-favoring priors and self-deceive about the existence of these priors in ourselves, even though we frequently observe them in others.</p>
<p>Self-deception is in some ways a more serious problem than mere lack of intelligence. It is embarrassing to be caught in a logical contradiction, as a stupid person might be, because it is often impossible to deny. But when accused of disagreeing due to a self-favoring prior, such as having an inflated opinion of one&#8217;s own judgment, people can and do simply deny the accusation.</p>
<p>How can we best cope with the problem of self-deception? Cowen and Hanson argue that we should be on the lookout for people who are &#8220;meta-rational,&#8221; honest truth-seekers who choose opinions as if they understand the problem of disagreement and self-deception. According to the theory of disagreement, meta-rational people will not have disagreements among themselves caused by faith in their own superior knowledge or reasoning ability. The fact that disagreement remains widespread suggests that most people are not meta-rational, or&#8212;what seems less likely&#8212;that meta-rational people cannot distinguish one another.</p>
<p>We can try to identify meta-rational people through their cognitive and conversational styles. Someone who is really seeking the truth should be eager to collect new information through listening rather than speaking, construe opposing perspectives in their most favorable light, and offer information of which the other parties are not aware, instead of simply repeating arguments the other side has already heard.</p>
<p>Contemporary macroeconomic debates are a case where it is clear that a number of participants on both sides possess less than average levels of meta-rationality. It seems clear, for instance, that the &#8220;<a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=12111">Internet Austrians</a>&#8221; are not meta-rational. It seems equally obvious that Krugman is not meta-rational.</p>
<p>For example, when Jeff Sachs put forth a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/professor-krugman-and-cru_b_2845773.html">long, reasoned argument</a> that Krugman&#8217;s crude Keynesianism was inadequate and dangerous, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/crude/">Krugman responded</a> by saying that his model was not crude but sophisticated, pointing to published research that Sachs has no doubt already read. He did not respond to Sachs&#8217;s factual assertion, for instance, that profits are soaring, or to his claim that this conflicts with Krugman&#8217;s argument that our economic problems are purely demand-related.</p>
<p>Another recent example comes from Krugman&#8217;s hasty dismissal of Miles Kimball, who <a href="http://qz.com/57082/what-paul-krugman-got-wrong-about-italys-economy/">argued more narrowly</a> that Krugman&#8217;s advice to Italy in particular to spend more was misguided. <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/another-attack-of-the-90-percent-zombie/">Krugman&#8217;s response</a>, in full, was that the paper that Kimball cited, by <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18015">Reinhart, Reinhart, and Rogoff</a>, did not constitute conclusive proof that high debt levels were bad for growth. I happen to agree in general about that paper, but, <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/stimulus-tools-policy-vs-politics.html">as Noah Smith pointed out</a>, Krugman himself had <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/debt-spreads-and-mysterious-omissions/">argued a mere three days earlier</a> that Eurozone countries, because they do not control their own currencies, do need to be concerned about their levels of debt. In case you need reminding, Italy is a Eurozone country.</p>
<p>And to take a non-recent example, who can forget Krugman&#8217;s <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/other-stuff-i-read/">blanket dismissal</a> of the &#8220;conservative&#8221; blogosphere: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know of any economics or politics sites on that side that regularly provide analysis or information I need to take seriously.&#8221; As if this were not already a caricature of self-deception, recall that Krugman frequently and irritatingly refers to libertarian economists as conservatives.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the rationality of disagreement with Krugman? To quote Cowen and Hanson (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>For a truth-seeker, the key question must be how sure you can be that you, at the moment, are substantially more likely to have a truth-seeking, in-control, rational core than the people you now disagree with. This is because <strong>if either of you have some substantial degree of meta-rationality, then your relative intelligence and information are largely irrelevant</strong> except as they may indicate which of you is more likely to be self-deceived about being meta-rational.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our intellects may be inferior to Krugman&#8217;s, but if we cultivate our own meta-rationality, we are more likely to be right than he is. Meta-rationality trumps intelligence. We would be fools to dismiss Krugman out-of-hand, because, after all, that would not be very meta-rational of us. But, having given due weight to his and other arguments, if we continue to disagree, we may do so with the strong suspicion that our disagreement is warranted.</p>

<p>If the above story is true (open to debate), then believing that awareness of self-deception improves an individual&#8217;s probability of accuracy may just be another form of self-deception. They may be no better off than people who buy into specific priors wholeheartedly and without question; in both cases it&#8217;s the larger system that takes their points of view as inputs that matters.</p>
<p>I believe there&#8217;s a Boettke paper along these lines, but having trouble finding it.</p>

<p>Edgar Cayce also received widespread acceptance in society, yet over time the ideas of Feynman were contradicted less than those of Cayce, so today Feynman&#8217;s contributions are accepted and believed by far more than those of Cayce.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-128" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I wanted to make the argument that self-reflection can&#8217;t lead to accuracy, only trusting stories that are time-tested by good feedback mechanisms can. But I see now that that&#8217;s orthogonal to this discussion&#8211;you could simply argue that, if true, then a self-reflecting person would figure it out and start trusting said time-tested stories.</p>
<p>I guess my real claim is that cognitive biases are inescapable. Even if you are aware of them, you&#8217;re still human. I don&#8217;t know anyone who has ended up changing their priors on, say, economics issues, because they became aware of their own cognitive biases. But again&#8211;that may just be my own confirmation bias, since I believed in the weakness of human reason long before I learned about cognitive biases.</p>
<p>And when people do change their mind, it seems to have more in common mechanistically with a religious conversion than with a socratic dialogue. In other words, it happens for internal, emotional reasons, rather than because of some new evidence or a logical argument.</p>
<p>Anyway, food for thought. I don&#8217;t know that people that you would describe as meta-rational _aren&#8217;t_ more likely to be accurate, but I&#8217;m constrained by my priors and am unaware of the empirical evidence on the matter.</p>

Most interesting questions in economics are identification questions, which cannot truly be answered by data but rather must rely on some set of assumptions to interpret data. What is our criteria for selecting those assumptions, as individuals? I&#8217;m not sure there _is_ a rational criteria. If there is, I would be grateful to have it pointed out!</p>

There are ALWAYS more priors to work through. That&#8217;s the nature of epistemology. That being said, understanding exactly where in the belief hierarchy you disagree with your opponent is the first step to understanding him. Most of the time we fight over issues at a level that disguises the real, higher level disagreements. In the end you get an entire country separated into red and blue states because the fundamental priors have bifurcated and we end up talking past each other. No one is really being &#8220;irrational&#8221; &#8230;most of the time.</p>

<p>Krugman does the opposite. Like a lot of very smart people, he&#8217;s pretty good at post hoc justifying positions he arrives at emotionally. At least, he&#8217;s &#8220;pretty good&#8221; if you only read his columns one at a time and don&#8217;t compare them to each other, or reality. But in a vacuum, it sounds convincing.

<p>And although I haven&#8217;t read their paper in detail, I&#8217;m not convinced that Cowen and Hanson aren&#8217;t also implicitly assuming common knowledge of some kind of rationality (or perhaps honesty).  How does exchanging my views with you help if I&#8217;m not sure that you&#8217;re honest?  Or if I&#8217;m not sure that you believe that I&#8217;m honest, I won&#8217;t conclude that you&#8217;re updating your beliefs based on what I tell you.  Or if I&#8217;m not sure that you believe that I&#8217;m completely convinced of your honesty &#8230;</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m wrong, but the result seems to require quite strong assumptions.  And therefore, taking the contrapositive, a failure to agree leads us to a very weak conclusion: that common knowledge of honesty or rationality doesn&#8217;t hold, not that honesty or rationality themselves must be absent on at least one side.</p>

<p>macro policy is about getting us to a good place &#8230; the economic &#8216;promised land&#8217; of 2 percent inflation, 6 percent unemployment rate, a rising standard of living for all and sustainable long-term public debt. there is no global solution to that complex objective. there is state of the world in which each of our respected (and even some kooky) macro bloggers would be right. what the policy maker needs to do is find the local solutions that apply broadly or that seem most in line with current conditions. there are no guarantees that the truth does not morph into the untruth, so the focus is results and the contest is who can bring the most attention and strength to their argument. </p>
<p>but this is good&#8230;a robust, heated exchange of ideas is important. my beef is that this exchange often veers off from ideas and turns into a personality pro wrestling match. I don&#8217;t need meta-rational, self-effacing economists, I need intelligent, creative economists who are willing to push their ideas and push others in their ideas.</p>

The assumption behind these discussions is that all that matters is data + intellectual power, with an implication that everyone is a sort of computer and if fed the same inputs, equally intelligent people should spit out the same results.  </p>
<p>Wisdom is neither data nor intelligence; it&#8217;s a sort of negative knowledge rooted in history and life experience, with far more wisdom gained from carefully examined failure than by success.  This is why, frankly, people who&#8217;ve done nothing but succeed (either by skill or because they carefully avoided failure) are often extremely unwise, and often find ways to fail spectacularly when they finally do so.</p>
<p>The modern world dramatically undervalues wisdom, probably because of the rather mechanical approach to how people &#8220;think about thinking&#8221;. </p>

You just get walked right over because your words lack a certain punch behind them. Countering dogmatism with dogmatism creates a contrived sense of balance where bystanders at least realize both sides make a claim to being right at the expense of the credibility of the other. Although I don&#8217;t agree with him on everything, I see Krugman as someone engaging in this fire against fire strategy.</p>

<p>And note how Krugman&#8217;s partisanship increased dramatically over the 2000s. If you look at his stuff in the &#8217;90s or early &#8217;00s, his writings sound like a completely different person wrote them.</p>

The inability of dogmatics to accept truth doesn&#8217;t make it false. Being right is sometimes bad for the individual, but it doesn&#8217;t change the nature of the truth. Ignaz Semmelweis is an excellent example of truth being trumped by convention. Only history has vindicated the poor fellow, but that&#8217;s not a credible reason to abandon or ignore meta-rationality.</p>

<p>Truth-seekers base their opinions on their own assessments of the facts as they see them. The opinions of others may influence them to look again at the facts, but that&#8217;s all they should do.  Attempts to provide a partial ordering of intelligence are futile at best and normally harmful; an analytical framework that starts by assuming that such a thing exists and is relevant is poetry, not science.</p>
<p>A heuristic that I employ if if do not have the time to study contested problems in detail for myself is to look for the thinkers who emphasise the partiality and contingency of their understanding and solutions. </p>
<p>To take some of your points: no more sophisticated macro-economic model has had better predictive or prescriptive success than crude Keynesianism in situations such as the one that developed in 2007 and 2008.  Jeff Sachs may very well have argued at length, but he argued wrongly. Krugman has never said, for instance, that multipliers are stable.  By applying his &#8220;crude Keynesianism&#8221; description to Krugman Sachs merely betrays that either he has not read what Krugman wrote, or he does not understand simple English.</p>
<p>Sachs has a track record of creative misconstrual and caricature: ask Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, or consult their blog for &#8220;Why Nations Fail.&#8221; There, too, Sachs betrays that his reading was at best superficial.  I can attest to this, having read the book.</p>
<p>Turning to Krugman&#8217;s dismissal of the libertarian and conservative blogosphere: an adequate criticism of his position would include examples of knowledge that Krugman should have had: predictions made that were more accurate than his own.  You provided nothing along these lines&#8211;no warrant at all, in fact&#8211;so your complaint amounts to saying that Krugman does not accept arguments from the authority of those blogs. We already knew that.</p>
<p>I take it back. This is not merely sophistry: it is juvenile sophistry.  Try to learn the difference between sophistry and rational argument; it will serve you well.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-171" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>An interesting perspective. Still, while I think you are correct in theory, there is an additional practicality that you must take into account: </p>
<p>Time is finite and the number of diverging opinions on internet is &#8211; for all practical purposes &#8211; infinite. While truly meta-rational actors would &#8211; in theory &#8211; carefully and honestly reconsider their perspectives and priors in light of every opposition, in practice this is completely impractical.</p>
<p>So what is a meta-rational actor to do?! The only reasonable course of action &#8211; to my mind &#8211; is to employ honest heuristics to prioritize whose diverging opinions you will devote some fraction of your limited time to honestly consider, and whose you will cursorily dismiss as a likely crack-pot. I propose that a reasonable such heuristic would be to triage the opinions of those who disagree with you based on the soundness of the arguments they&#8217;ve put forth in the past. (Even that is not sufficient, however, as no one has time to give everyone out there a chance to make a first impression &#8211; so we end up having to use proxies such as credentials and recommendations from known parties to further prioritize).</p>
<p>In any event, I agree that any reasonable person should consider Jeffery Sachs as one whose opposition should not be dismissed lightly. At the same time, I don&#8217;t blame Krugman from writing-off a large portion of the blogosphere off-hand.</p>

Specifically, the proof of Bayesian coherence requires that all propositions are subject to resolution through betting. </p>
<p>However, consider the law of the excluded middle. It is a purely logical axiom, and so evidence of the excluded middle (used to settle the bet) must be a deductive proof. (Since it is a theorem of classical logic, the axioms of probability theory imply it should have probability 1.) But there is no proof of it that does not already assume it (or something stronger) as an axiom! As a result, a constructive mathematician can reject the excluded middle, but you will still not be able to construct a Dutch book against her. Any proof of the excluded middle you offer her necessarily uses axioms she does not accept, and so you cannot offer mutually-acceptable evidence that the constructivist is wrong &#8212; the two of you will simply disagree about whether or not P or not-P holds for all P.</p>
<p>Ergo, persistent disagreement is in fact both possible and rational. (And meta-rational!)</p>

<p>After all, Krugman was arguing that high debt levels were not bad, when only three days earlier, he had been arguing that high debt levels were not bad!  And if consistency in argument were not bad enough, he engages in &#8220;blanket dismissals&#8221;, and one time Eli didn&#8217;t like the way he answered Jeff Sachs!

<p>Example: Person A and Person B disagree about the truth of statement X.  Person A believes X is false.  Person B believes X is true.  Person A and B have the exact same intelligence and information.  However, this disagreement is different from the examples above in that A and B share the same biases in support of X.  Person A could then conclude that she is more likely to be correct because she&#8217;s meta-rational.  She&#8217;s not being humble about her faults and admitting that her argument is possibly flawed because of her biases.  It fact, she might be bragging about how she&#8217;s so smart for accounting for her biases with made her come around to believe X to be false.</p>
<p>These arguments almost never occur though.  Even in cases of pre-apostates, it&#8217;s hard to argue that they come to the table with the same set of biases as non-pre-apostates.  No one probably shares the exact same set of relevant biases as someone else.  Perhaps there is a clearer distinction between humility and meta-rationality in the context of disagreements.  </p>
<p>Still, meta-rationality doesn&#8217;t appear to have to be about humility.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality might fall into the domain of common sense, but common sense is much broader.  Reminding someone &#8220;to have common sense&#8221; probably won&#8217;t inform the individual&#8217;s argumentation at that moment, even if they know of the meta-rationality flaw, because the term is too broad.  Therefore the &#8220;meta-rationality&#8221; serves a purpose.</p>

<p>Or was it up to Sachs (3/9) to respond to Krugman (2/8, 2/9, 2/10)?</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve had a mild-mannered dispute with Joe Stiglitz over whether individual income inequality is retarding recovery right now; let me say, however, that I think there’s a very good case that the redistribution of income away from labor to corporate profits is very likely a big factor. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s really out of line with previous experience is the level of corporate profits, which is arguably serving as a kind of sinkhole for purchasing power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Riedl and Cochrane, [Cowen] concedes that there might be some problem if corporations literally piled up stacks of green paper; but he argues that it’s completely different if they put the money in a bank, which will lend it out, or use it to buy securities, which can be used to finance someone else’s spending. But of course there isn’t any difference. If you put money in a bank, the bank might just accumulate excess reserves. If you buy securities from someone else, the seller might put the cash in his mattress, or put it in a bank that just adds it to its reserves, etc., etc.. The point is that buying goods and services is one thing, adding directly to aggregate demand; buying assets isn’t at all the same thing, especially when we’re at the zero lower bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>How do I know he&#8217;s right? Because I have read his book &#8220;End This Depression Now&#8221; and I can see that he is. Krugman is not a narrow-minded guy who thinks in cliches. He obviously has a sharp mind that penetrates problems deeply and shrewdly. His opponents? &#8211; Shallow-minded people who can&#8217;t think out of the box. </p>
<p>If all you do is juggle with hollow concepts and never try to see through the fog of &#8220;common sense&#8221; you won&#8217;t understand Krugman. And this is not so much about intelligence. What Krugman says isn&#8217;t really complex. It is in fact simple and obvious. To understand him you need attitude, not fast processing brain cells.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-207" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hume argued this same point in the 18th century.  In the past two or three years Jonathan Haidt and Drew Westen wrote popular psychology and political books that had evidence and examples that supported Hume&#8217;s point, and would also support this author.  Hume&#8217;s viewpoint is also supported by neuroanatomy, because the most recently evolved portion of the brain, the neocortex, is plastic, repetitively structured, and processes information; while the more ancient structures in the base of the brain next to the skull seem to provide emotion and the ability to make decisions.  These ancient structures are what motivate us, and the ability to reason evolved in order to support them.  For more information about what the different structures in the brain do read &#8220;The Archaeology of Mind&#8221; by Jaak Panksepp.  From Stanford&#8217;s online Encyclopedia of Philosophy: &#8220;Hume famously sets himself in opposition to most moral philosophers, ancient and modern, who talk of the combat of passion and reason, and who urge human beings to regulate their actions by reason and to grant it dominion over their contrary passions. He claims to prove that “reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will,” and that reason alone “can never oppose passion in the direction of the will” (T 413). His view is not, of course, that reason plays no role in the generation of action; he grants that reason provides information, in particular about means to our ends, which makes a difference to the direction of the will. His thesis is that reason alone cannot move us to action; the impulse to act itself must come from passion. The doctrine that reason alone is merely the “slave of the passions,” i.e., that reason pursues knowledge of abstract and causal relations solely in order to achieve passions&#8217; goals and provides no impulse of its own, is defended in the Treatise, but not in the second Enquiry, although in the latter he briefly asserts the doctrine without support. Hume gives three arguments in the Treatise for the motivational “inertia” of reason alone.&#8221;</p>

In fact in the total sum of accepted human knowledge a significant percentage is wrong.  It is the intelligence of large groups that requires hardened priors.  I am a mega rational and often finding myself fighting priors in established groups.  This causes discord and dysfunction which can be more damaging than the potential misinformation.  The half life of hardened priors is 50 years, so there are macro reasons for krugman to be using his influence to harden new priors rather than seeking truth</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-218" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It could be that someone who is hyper meta rational became less so over time on a given topic because he has considered all possibilities and have eliminated the veracity of most of them through careful analysis; and therefore have arrived at the conclusion that only hypothesis 1 or 2 may be correct.  Now, it would seem that according to you, he is less meta rational than someone who is considering all 10 possibilities because the latter is more, self-doubting, humble and open-minded on the subject matter.  Or perhaps&#8230; he is just more self-doubting because he doesn&#8217;t know much about the subject matter.  So I can be meta rational on the topic of economics than Krugman?  That sounds comical because it leaves no room for progression of thought and the development of expertise over time.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t 100% agree with what Krugman writes just because I think economics is highly subjective and different situations call for different economic models.  I am also wary of people who have such strong politcal leanings because to me, they are idealogues.  And idealogues always have an agenda, which may taint their truth seeking abilities.  But I do hold the opinion of Krugman and other &#8220;experts&#8221; in high regard because he has obviously spent years studying economics more than I have.  </p>
<p>As for the whole line of reasoning that it&#8217;s better to make mistakes because you learn from them as opposed to people who succeed from the get go &#8212; I find this argument to be a bit bizarre.  Perhaps someone never made a mistake because he was highly self-doubting so he was more critical about different options; therefore, he made better judgments and became successful without making mistakes.  As a highly skeptical person, not just of other people but of myself as well and any data or philosophy, I may make less mistakes than people who aren&#8217;t self-doubting at all.  A meta rational person can learn through the mistakes of others rather than one&#8217;s own.</p>
