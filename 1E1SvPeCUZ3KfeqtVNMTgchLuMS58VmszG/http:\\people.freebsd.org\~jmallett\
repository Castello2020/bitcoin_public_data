  <h2>FreeBSD</h2>
  <p>
   I am doing work related to FreeBSD on MIPS, specifically Cavium Octeon, in
   -CURRENT.  I also like to send people patches privately for various
   networking-related things, and occasionally contribute to discussion on
   -net@.
  </p>
  <p>
   Feel free to thank me for my work on FreeBSD by complicating my income
   tax filings!  You can send BTC to this address:
   <tt>1E1SvPeCUZ3KfeqtVNMTgchLuMS58VmszG</tt>.

  <h2>Life</h2>
  <p>
   I...
   <ul>
    <li>...live in Olympia, Washington (state) in the United States.</li>
    <li>...am entirely lousy at keeping a personal webpage.</li>
    <li>...took part in the 2007 Mongol Rally (and made it to Mongolia.)</li>
    <li>...am attending the Episcopal Divinity School.</li>
    <li>...have an unhealthy obsession with <a href="chili-paneer.html">chili paneer</a>.</li>
    <li>...am experimenting with keeping a <a href="http://caladri.ca">personal website</a>.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
   I currently work full-time as a consultant.  I am studying for a graduate
   degree.  I have regular volunteer commitments.  My ability to work on open
   source projects is pretty constrained these days, and mostly either coincides
   with work, or coincides with a period of taking some time away from work.
   My apologies if you attempt to contact me and I do not respond.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <h2>Non-Projects</h2>
  <p>
   Sometimes I throw together little tools or modify others' tools to suit my
   own needs.  You're probably interested in them.  (At least, I can't imagine
   why else you might actually be reading this.)
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li><a href="blindvnc">blindvnc</a>, a modified version of TightVNC's
       <tt>vncviewer</tt> that is stripped down to support only input.</li>
   <li><a href="diff-filter.c">diff-filter</a>, a program to select individual
       files to extract or remove from a diff based on a regex applied to their
       file names.</li>
   <li><a href="buildomat">buildomat</a>, a job-controlling, web-displaying
       front-end to the FreeBSD build process.</li>
   <li><a href="sboxes-1.txt">sboxes-1</a>, some randomly-generated 8-bit
       s-boxes with useful properties.  (And some without many useful
       properties.)  I really wish there were an s-box database like the OEIS
       where people could annotate them with useful properties like "no fixed
       points" "has fixed points when used in a substitution-rotation cipher" or
       even "has fixed points when used in a 16-bit substitution-rotation
       ciphers along with [some other s-box]."  I will, of course, be glad to
       add annotations to this list of s-boxes if anyone has any interesting
       observations that they decide to share with me.</li>
   <li><a href="octeon-dmesg">Octeon <tt>dmesg(8)</tt>s</a>, a collection of
       boot output logs from various Octeon systems running FreeBSD/MIPS.</li>
   <li><a href="pharaoh.html">Pharaoh's Shuffle</a>, a listing of results from a
       Pharaoh's Shuffle done on decks of cards with various sizes,
       demonstrating the incorrectness of assertions that 8 shuffles will
       preserve the order of a deck of any size.  Results are also shown for
       doing <a href="pharaoh-inshuffle.html">in-shuffles</a> rather than the
       standard out-shuffles, as well as for
       <a href="pharaoh-inout.html">alternating between doing in- and
       out-shuffles</a>.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/caladri/bsdplus">BSD+</a>, a set of libraries
       and utilities meant to be useful on BSD systems, or to add new
       functionality in the BSD tradition.  At the time of writing here it is
       still fairly trivial, including <tt>diff-filter</tt> mentioned above and
       tools for getting the device name associated with a (possibly-renamed)
       network interface.</li>
   <li><a href="key-flop.html">Key flopping</a>, a proposal to increase
       robustness of cryptosystems which use public keys to identify a
       host.</li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
   I have released a WAN optimization proxy which does dictionary compression
   (also called "deduplication" in the storage industry) under the name
   <a href="http://wanproxy.org">WANProxy</a>.  It is available under a BSD
   license.  It is relatively stable and supports a number of platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
   I do love to tinker, and used to maintain a list of little projects I'd worked
   on recently here, and longer-term research interests, but it's difficult to
   keep up with it, and it didn't seem to interest anyone much other than me.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <h2>Resume</h2>
  <p>
   I enjoy and am very experienced with building out software platforms from the
   ground up.  I prefer to take broad direction or a big-picture idea and go
   from there to developing a solution that provides a foundation and
   infrastructure for future big ideas.  This has taken the form of things like
   event systems, build systems, board support packages, lots of new network
   protocols, highly-scriptable proxy software, etc.  I find it more useful to
   say that than to point to a resume when at this point I've spent several
   years working as a consultant and originated more new projects than I can
   begin to enumerate.  I love to guide and enable innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
   That said, I do make a version of my resume available
   <a href="resume.html">here</a>.  It is never as clear, relevant or up-to-date
   as I would like; it's probably best to talk to me about what you're looking
   for if you think you might need my skills.  I am always happy to refer to
   more appropriate candidates when personally-approached.
  </p>

 <div>
  <h2>Impossible Algorithms</h2>
  <p>
   I'm interested in collecting a list of algorithms which can't exist, but
   might sound like they could.  Algorithms which would make you rich beyond
   reason if you could discover them, but which you know violate basic axioms.
   You know, the kind of things Hollywood might presume to exist.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Proof-of-deletion</strong>; a cryptographic algorithm which can
       be used to prove to another party that all copies of a piece of
       information can be deleted.  (NB: That sounds even more narrow than it
       is; proving that any copy of a piece of information has been deleted
       can be extended to proving that all copies of a piece of information
       have been deleted.  You can model it as a refcount, so the number of
       readers doesn't matter while it's over 1; verifying the number of copies
       in existence is the same as verifying that there are 0 copies.)  The
       hard part is to do this without relying on any <em>service</em>, i.e.
       some kind of information escrow which uses DRM or the like to resist
       copying.  Cryptographic proof of non-copying and of deletion is the hard
       part.  Might be feasible with quantum computing, since you can determine
       whether quantum information has been observed or erased, right?  (I'm no
       expert on that.)  You can prove that it's impossible just by virtue of
       the fact that a determined human can remember anything, whatever demands
       you might impose on a computer.  Still, think of the possibilities!
       Great for blackmail, all kinds of privacy issues, Bitcoin escrow, etc.
       Too bad it's impossible.  But what interesting subsets aren't?</li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div>
  <h2>Various Affinities and Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
   I enjoy spending time with my goats, ducks, chickens and peacocks.  I am of
   rather more mixed feelings about spending time with my bees, but they're
   great all the same.  I like planting fruit and nut trees.
  </p>
  <p>
   I enjoy living in the Pacific Northwest, but miss living in Polynesia.  I'll
   take the Pacific Rim over total disconnection from the Pacific Ocean.
  </p>
  <p>
   Keeping with locale for the moment: I have spent a small amount of time in
   Siberia and Mongolia and would greatly love to return to both for a more
   extended period some time.  I've been studying Mongolian with varying degrees
   of dedication and focus for a few years now.
  </p>
  <p>
   I like languages and writing systems, but it's hard to learn them without
   immersion, at least for me.  I spent weeks trying fruitlessly to learn
   Cyrillic before taking part in the Mongol Rally, and then months later when
   I was in Ukraine it was something I picked up within a few days.  I adore
   Hangul and wish I had the opportunity to learn it better.  In studying
   Mongolian, I've learned some to read Mongol Bichig (the Mongolian vertical
   script; contemporary not classical, where possible), but without a period of
   immersion or regular practice, I don't keep up my skills.
  </p>
  <p>
   I like dessert wines, Indian-Chinese food, Italo Disco, the Episcopal Church,
   Orthodox sacramental theology, Aikido and Jungian psychoanalysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   I have tattoos and piercings and have often dyed my hair unnatural colors.
  </p>
  <p>
   When I make the time for it, I enjoy doing many things: kayaking, cooking,
   glasswork, hiking, film photography, making electronic music, motorcycling,
   etc.  I am a little bit of a Pacific Northwest stereotype.  "Which one?" is
   an interesting question, though.

  <h2>Remembering</h2>
  <p>
   I wish to remember Alan Eldridge, who died in 2003.  He and I had been
   talking about the dire job situation just before his death, and I got a great
   job very shortly after.  I wanted so badly to tell him how much better the
   market was getting, and that there was still hope, and I couldn't.  Many have
   mentioned his love of Warren Zevon, and when I (however infrequently) hear a
   Warren Zevon song, I still think of him.
  </p>
  <p>
   I wish also to remember Cameron Grant, who died in 2005.  He was a great
   friend, and I still miss him acutely.  In 2007, I had the pleasure of meeting
   his father, and my partner and I bought a car that had been his to do the
   Mongol Rally.  The trip was in many ways a chance to reflect on Cameron's
   passing, and to try to do some good things in his memory, and to have fun in
   his spirit.  His impact on my life was major; in the short time we knew
   eachother, he greatly helped me in coming to terms with myself and the
   difficulties of life and other people.  He was a truly charming man.
  </p>
  <p>
   I wish also to remember Andy Purshottam, who died in 2007.  His presence was
   always strange and awkward, delightful and unexpected.  He regularly shared
   his thoughts with friends via email, and I was always pleased to find a new
   one greeting me in my inbox, with far-flung links and thoughts on technology.
   He moved with a gentle self-assuredness and had a fierce inability to deal
   with people who were there to waste his time.  He despised fools and
   corruption, and was always glad to explain himself.  His emails stopped, and
   I was informed that he had died, unexpectedly and sadly.  I find myself
   wanting to share thoughts and links with him, and struggle to remind myself
   that he is no longer there.
  </p>
  <p>
   I remember also Robert Mallett, my grandfather, who died in 2013.  He was an
   engineer and an avid Unix fan, and had no small influence on my own passion
   about computers and technology, and the shape of my career.  There is too
   much to say about him personally, but in this list in particular it seems
   like I must say that he was always curious, and encouraged me to be as well;
   he imbued me with a love of science, math and experimentation.  As my great
   engagement with Unix really flourished, he gave me use of piles and piles of
   old Sun and SGI equipment, and would remind me how to get out of
   <tt>vi(1)</tt> when I got stuck.  He was so much more than that to me, of
   course; I grew up very close to him.  I've always hoped to please and impress
   him with my career and my work, and I think it important to say to those who
   value my technical output that I could not possibly have done any of it
   without him.
  </p>
  <p>
   I wish to remember Alex Botero-Lowry, who died in 2012.  We had been friends
   since the late 1990s, but never quite managed to meet up, always barely
   passing each other in space.  We met and bonded around a shared obsession and
   fascination with computers of a certain era, the hopeful and expansive
   aesthetic that permeated the late '80s and early '90s, an era which was
   clearly formative for us both.  Being able to share that imagination and
   enthusiasm for technology with someone was very important to me.  As we grew
   up, we shared our struggles and the many changes in our lives with each
   other.  He was always bright, energetic, sweet and reflective.  It pains me
   to know that we will not manage to meet up some day in San Francisco or
   Portland after all, and the future seems a little bleaker for its lack of
   him.
