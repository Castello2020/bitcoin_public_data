      The MagusNet Anonymous Public Proxy a.k.a (Torduckin) 
      =====-
      We are actively seeking financial Donations, Grants, and Philanthropic sources to pay for
      bandwidth and servers to continuously build out as a fully free globally distributed service.
      Donations of any kind ( especially hardware ) are always welcome.
      If you have a working 64bit X86 Server you are willing to donate, get in touch with me :)
      -=====-

      Why do I do it?

      I created and ran the original MagusNet Anonymous Public Proxy (based on DeleGate) starting in 1997 and 
      decided to come back with a new MagusNet Anonymous Public Proxy (Torduckin) in 2011 to do something better
      based on my experience in Information Security and development of innovative ways of deploying Information 
      and Communications Technology (ICT).

      I want to be able to give globally by promoting the following:

      - Freedom of Opinion and Expression beyond National Borders
      - Anonymity and Privacy to Communicate Freely 

      The Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
      http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml

      The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights:
      http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm

      "Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority...It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the
      Bill of Rights, and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation
      and their ideas from suppression at the hand of an intolerant society."  - Justice Stevens, U.S. Supreme Court

The MagusNet Anonymous Public Proxy Servers (Torduckin) run 100% diskless in Virtual Machines!<BR>
The MagusNet Anonymous Public Proxy Servers (Torduckin) are currently configured to support 10,000 concurrent global users per node which allows us to scale to any size based on demand.<BR>
The MagusNet Anonymous Public Proxy Servers (Torduckin) communication path looks like this:<BR>
<CENTER>
<H3>INTERNET DATA PATH (ALL USERS)<BR>
<B>YOU===OpenVPN Tunnel===VDE Encrypted Tunnel===MagusNet Public Proxy===Tor/SSH===Web Site</B>
<BR><H3>
9/2013 - Due to the latest information about Intelligence gathering, I now push SSH through Tor instead of Tor through SSH.
<BR></H3>
</H3>
</CENTER>
<BR>For security and maintenance purposes all Torduckin Virtual Machines are regularly deleted and reloaded into RAM from Read-Only media.<BR>
Take a look at the <A HREF="faq.html">MagusNet Public Proxy FAQ</A> for more details and updates.<BR>

	PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE PAGE BEFORE USING THE PROXY.<br>
	IT'S LONG BUT THERE IS A LOT OF IMPORTANT <br> INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS PAGE.<br>
      <center>USE POLICY LAST UPDATED: May 1, 2011 08:00 EST </center>
    </center></STRONG><BR><BR>
    Use of the service implies acceptance of this:
    <a href="magusnet-policy.txt"> MagusNet LLC. Acceptable Use Policy.</a> 
    <br>
    In some cases you may want to go to a WWW site and have it appear that 
    you are coming from somewhere else.<br>
    The OpenVPN Software used is set up for encrypting the session with
    2048 bit SSL for even more security between you <BR>and this site while you browse
    the WWW anonymously and safely.<br>
    This is also a good way to thwart attempts to filter WWW content by 
    geographic location, hosts, domains, or software packages.<BR>
    As with any product which claims to make you anonymous, the user must 
    rely on the operator. In this case MagusNet, LLC.<br>
    I ask for donations and sell accounts because my budget for bandwidth is not infinite <BR>
    and this is on an internal testing system so I have to raise funds to keep this going.<br>
    <P>
    <BR><B>Can The MagusNet Anonymous Public Proxy (Torduckin) be trusted?</B><BR>
    All proxy servers are designed to maintain logs of activities and transactions.<br>
    There is not a 100% guarantee of privacy since MagusNet, LLC. has access to these logs.<BR>
    Until such time as a reason for having to produce or store the proxy logs arises, <BR>
    the logs for the MagusNet Anonymous Public Proxy are automatically purged at minimum on an hourly basis <BR> and at maximum every 24 hours.<br>
    There is no use for any system logs except to examine usage statistics and bandwidth abuses. <BR>
    Logging of source and/or destination IP addresses is never done in any of our servers for any reason<BR>
    and that policy is in place to preserve and protect privacy and anonymity.<br>
    <B>Should that policy ever change, the proxy will be shut down and a note made
    of it here before determining the feasibility of resuming service.<br></B>
