I entered a buy order last night for QRK at Cryptsy. The order has never showed up on the Open Orders table, yet my BTC balance was already reduced. I already opened a ticket with Cryptsy, I'm just curious if others have had similar issues with Cryptsy.This is my 2nd Buy. The first one worked perfect, so I'm a little leary as to what is up.

I realize that there was a bit of a crash yesterday and last night. I think Cryptsy can't handle the activity plain and simple.I'm over on the Cryptsy support board and I'm not the only one. There are hundreds of pissed off people that their orders are lost, and their coins.Trader beware.I will not trade with Cryptsy again until this BS is resolved. Fortunately for me it was only about $50 worth of BTC, but others lost orders worth thousands. QRK: QhqJK6hfBq8kVJfVJuDAFP2rkQgdEFPwyA

I guess they're having a lot more problems than just deposits. My order is still not showing, and it was placed 16 hours ago. In the mean time, I don't have access to some of my BTC. That is the frustrating part.These growing pains are to be somewhat expected. In a way, it's good news for Crypto Currency. It means the exchange has more activity than it can handle. Bad news in the short term, hopefully good news in the long run.

I removed all my Quark from Cryptsy way to unstable for my liking. They were quick to respond and fix all the issues but this should not happen. I really wanted to get behind them also, I'm afraid when the huge influx comes over the next few weeks its just going to get worse. : (

YOu had quick response? I've had NO response and it's over 24 hours now. My BTC has been returned to my balance, but my order is still showing in the buy orders window. The sight is screwed. I'm with you, I'm going to do what I can to get my coins outta there. Is there another exchange where you can trade BTC for QRK? QRK: QhqJK6hfBq8kVJfVJuDAFP2rkQgdEFPwyA
