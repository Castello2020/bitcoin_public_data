All of the examples in the article say the same thing: nobody is actually *buying* anything with Bitcoin at these businesses, but saying that you accept Bitcoin is (or was, at least) a way to generate press. Essentially, a very cheap method of advertising. With the Chicago Sun-Times only having 7 Bitcoin sales in their first week of acceptance, however, you have to wonder how long the &amp;quot;accepting Bitcoin = free press&amp;quot; formula will continue to work, if it&#39;s even continuing to work at all.</description></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22v6af/banks_admit_to_ripping_people_off_secret/cgqr3ff</guid><title>BLEAOURGH on Banks admit to ripping people off (secret recordings)</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22v6af/banks_admit_to_ripping_people_off_secret/cgqr3ff</link><dc:date>2014-04-12T12:24:37.106284-07:00</dc:date><description>Down with these damn big banks!!

Not sure about Tiger Direct. &amp;quot;Well, if you look at merchants accepting bitcoin most of them immediately sells off their bitcoin, AKA converts them to fiat. AFAIK what this does is reduce the price of bitcoins because of some mechanism i haven&#39;t quite groked yet(enlighten me?).&amp;quot; I have a Bitcoin, I buy something from Tiger Direct via Coinbase. Coinbase takes my Bitcoin and gives Tiger Direct the equivalent value in USD. In order to minimize risk, Coinbase immediately sells (most of, if not all) of the bitcoin I just used on an exchange. Effectively, buying something with Bitcoin is the same as selling it on an exchange. 2) For other, smaller companies, it&#39;s not worth the hassle. Virtually every merchant who &amp;quot;accepts Bitcoin&amp;quot; really just accepts fiat through Bitpay or Coinbase. Given the recent IRS ruling, a smaller shop would never want to accept and store Bitcoin, since it&#39;s an accounting nightmare. Also, it&#39;s a pretty tough sell: &amp;quot;Hey, the price of Bitcoin has been falling too much, so could you stop selling some and instead risk your business&#39; profits on a high volatility asset?&amp;quot; 3) &amp;quot;Getting business to understand this and somehow getting them under the bitcoin umbrella and ethos isn&#39;t that stupid is it?&amp;quot; Honestly: yes, it is pretty stupid. In general, businesses exist to be profitable, they don&#39;t exist to promote the Bitcoin agenda. Most businesses that are accepting Bitcoin don&#39;t even give a shit about it, they just wanted the publicity that came out of it.</description></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/21s2ot/the_big_picture/cgg02v1</guid><title>BLEAOURGH on The Big Picture</title><link>http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/21s2ot/the_big_picture/cgg02v1</link><dc:date>2014-03-30T23:23:59.241940+00:00</dc:date><description>Helpful hint: when something looks linear on a log chart, it means either exponential growth or exponential decay.

Either 1) you guys will take the Bitcoin, convert it to fiat, then give it to someone (who you have yet to specify), making it completely pointless; or 2) you will give someone Bitcoin which is completely worthless until they find an exchange to convert it into hryvnia, which make be difficult or impossible to do during an **armed revolution**.
