&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hiddencash&quot;&gt;Hidden Cash&lt;/a&gt; treasure hunt phenomenon has gone digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/hiddencash-millionaire-identified-2014-6/#.U78AL41dUSE&quot;&gt;In May, someone started hiding envelopes of cash all over San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and now someone is leaving bitcoin wallets around the city, sending people on a digital scavenger hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt is appropriately called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sfhiddenbitcoin&quot;&gt;@SFHiddenBitcoin&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wallets are aluminum cards, with a bitcoin address and corresponding private key that can be imported to the wallet of the person who finds the card. &lt;a href=&quot;http://coinbrief.net/sf-hidden-bitcoin-san-francisco/&quot;&gt;Each card is worth around $20&lt;/a&gt;, according to Coinbrief. But there's no telling whether the prizes will remain consistent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt will continue around the city &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sfhiddenbitcoin/status/481968831569485824&quot;&gt;at least for the entire month of July&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the original, Hidden Bitcoin leaves clues through its Twitter account. Once a wallet is found, it's announced on Twitter and people have to wait till another clue is given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the bitcoin wallets are hidden all over the city &amp;mdash; including, it appears, at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's house:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't pay $10m for a house without making a few enemies &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/WSN2snj3XQ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/WSN2snj3XQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't the only scavenger hunt going on in the Bay Area right now, either. This weekend people with a valid medical marijuana card can participate in Quest Hunt, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2014/07/someone_stashed_weed_in_oaklan.php#more&quot;&gt;a cannabis scavenger hunt&lt;/a&gt; where the prize is, you guessed it, marijuana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-6-back-shell-2014-7&quot; &gt;The iPhone 6 could come in a new dark gray color&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float_right&quot; src=&quot;http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/53bf3129eab8ead63dab770e-480-/friends-happy-laughing-jumping-twenty-somethings-13.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;friends happy laughing jumping, twenty-somethings&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the day after a long night out, and your first thought upon regaining consciousness is: What did I do on social media last night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sobrr.me/&quot;&gt;Sobrr&lt;/a&gt;, the app that wants to facilitate your ephemeral friendships. It's basically a Snapchat for the relationships you make while you're out on the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sobrr allows you to make &quot;24-hour friendships&quot; that erase themselves in that amount of time unless both parties agree to continue the friendship. You can send messages, photos, and private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it&amp;rsquo;s a good fit, you can both become a permanent part of the other&amp;rsquo;s crew,&quot; says Sobrr's blog. &quot;If not, that&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;okay.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sobrr wants you to &quot;live in the moment,&quot; a line aimed at millennials if we've ever seen one. The app's creators are betting that if you know that anything you say or do on the app will be erased in 24 hours, you'll be more outgoing and ultimately, happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The app is only available on iOS for now, though you can send messages to someone who doesn't have the app and they'll receive a link via SMS and be redirected to a web browser.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;span&gt;Sobrr freely and don&amp;rsquo;t worry about tomorrow,&quot; says the Sobrr blog. &quot;Not everything needs to last.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/this-app-wants-you-to-forget-your-friends-after-you-make-them-2014-7#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float_right&quot; src=&quot;http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/53bf420069bedd1b3da6d855-480-/iwatch-concept-23.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;iWatch Concept&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what's been reported lately, analyst&amp;nbsp;Ming-Chi Kuo says &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2014/07/10/analyst-ming-chi-kuo-apples-sapphire-covered-iwatch-to-enter-mass-production-in-november/&quot;&gt;Apple's iWatch will go into production in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac has Kuo's research note in which Kuo says,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have pushed back our estimated time of iWatch mass production from late-September to mid-/late- November ... We also lower our forecast of iWatch 2014 shipments by 40% to 3mn units.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Kuo has a track record of producing &quot;relatively accurate&quot; Apple insights, but even Gurman says Kuo's predictions around timing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/487409581111271426&quot;&gt;aren't great&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo's strength is on what the product looks like/is made out of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuo says the iWatch will have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-video-of-the-iphone-6s-flexible-sapphire-screen-cover-2014-7&quot;&gt;Apple's sapphire glass&lt;/a&gt;, which has been getting press this week for its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-6-screen-torture-test-2014-7&quot;&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;The iWatch is also expected to have a flexible AMOLED display and be at least water-resistant if not water proof, says Kuo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Water resistance seems important since the iWatch is supposed to be used for working out, which leads to sweat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous reports have said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iwatch-launch-2014-6&quot;&gt;the iWatch will be out in October&lt;/a&gt;. We're still inclined to believe that will happen, but it's possible Apple is having a hard time manufacturing the iWatch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/apples-iwatch-will-go-into-production-this-novemeber-2014-7#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>

&lt;p&gt;But before Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and a host of other major tech companies set up shop there, the Santa Clara Valley was the center of a different industry altogether.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than office buildings and parking lots, the Valley was covered in orchards and farmland. It was one of the largest suppliers of produce in the United States, and continues to be an agricultural hub today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historysanjose.org/&quot;&gt;History San Jos&amp;eacute;&lt;/a&gt;, a Silicon Valley-based historical organization, shared some photos from their archives that show how much the region has changed since its beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Before it was Silicon Valley, the Santa Clara Valley was a land of orchards and farmland. This photo, taken from the top of Mount Hamilton in 1914, shows the wide expanse of the valley. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/53bdb316ecad04367eb61b1a-400-300/before-it-was-silicon-valley-the-santa-clara-valley-was-a-land-of-orchards-and-farmland-this-photo-taken-from-the-top-of-mount-hamilton-in-1914-shows-the-wide-expanse-of-the-valley.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Known by many as the &quot;Valley of Heart's Delight,&quot; early 20th-century farms in the Santa Clara Valley supplied one-third of the world's prunes, in addition to huge quantities of tomatoes, grains, onions, carrots, cherries, and walnuts. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/53bdb315eab8ea0e677c8078-400-300/known-by-many-as-the-valley-of-hearts-delight-early-20th-century-farms-in-the-santa-clara-valley-supplied-one-third-of-the-worlds-prunes-in-addition-to-huge-quantities-of-tomatoes-grains-onions-carrots-cherries-and-walnuts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A group of men posed with a trenching machine made by the Knapp Plow Company. The manufacturers were an important part of the region's development into an agricultural hub, as the plows they created made it possible to farm the valley's hillsides.  &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We've created a slideshow highlighting the retail categories where e-commerce is having the most impact, and where there is still opportunity for disruption.

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/52b1b9a96bb3f77459b3cc26-845-451/caesar dawn of the planet of the apes.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;caesar dawn of the planet of the apes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2103281/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot;&gt;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&lt;/a&gt;&quot; swings into theaters this Friday along with some of the most state of the art &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-motion-capture-2014-5&quot;&gt;motion capture visual effects.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the film's technology allowed actors like Andy Serkis to bring the planet of the apes to life, it also allowed director (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/matt-reeves-fan-of-franchise-before-directing-dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-2014-7&quot;&gt;avid &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; fanboy&lt;/a&gt;) Matt Reeves to tinker with the film's ending via Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slashfilm.com/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-scenes-directed-skype/&quot;&gt;/Film&lt;/a&gt;, Reeves was able to redo the end of the film by directing Serkis over the message service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;&quot;This is the first movie where I&amp;rsquo;ve ever directed scenes over Skype. And mo-cap enables you to do that. And actually that last shot, when I realized that that was not the right ending, I went to [visual effects studio] Weta and I said, okay, so we gotta do something different. And they&amp;rsquo;re like, well you&amp;rsquo;re gonna need a performance. So we did a thing where Andy was in London and he was at [his performance capture studio] the Imaginarium. And we hooked up via Skype and I looked at a big plasma and I talked him through what was going on in that last sequence as he&amp;rsquo;s coming down those steps. And we basically did it over Skype.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Reeves used Skype to make last minute changes to other scenes as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;For example, Reeves was able to direct actor Jason Clarke and Serkis simultaneously while Clarke was in his hotel room shooting another film in Rome and Serkis was in London.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Reeves, Skype allowed him to put together these minor reshoots with only six weeks until the premiere and with his cast and crew scattered around the world. It also allowed him to be one of the first to put a film together using the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if we&amp;rsquo;re the only one, or if we&amp;rsquo;re the first movie to have done a scene on Skype,&quot; Reeves added. &quot;But it&amp;rsquo;s certainly the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve done it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-final-trailer-2014-6&quot; &gt;New 'Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes' Trailer Will Make You Jump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-asks-faa-to-let-it-ramp-up-drone-developments/&quot;&gt;The FAA has six designated drone-testing sites across the country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but Amazon wants to run its tests near Seattle, where its private R&amp;amp;D center is located, according to CNET.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Amazon Prime Air&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/12/forget-amazons-two-day-shipping-soon-you-can-select-drone-delivery/&quot;&gt;was announced in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; special&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on CBS last December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;With the exemption, Amazon hopes to speed up the development of its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-faa-just-shot-down-amazons-drone-delivery-service-2014-6&quot;&gt;Amazon Prime Air service&lt;/a&gt;. But the FAA allows exemptions only if the entity proves the testing is beneficial to the public and does not affect public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regulations.gov/#!searchResults;rpp=25;so=DESC;sb=postedDate;po=0;s=amazon;dct=O%252BPS;a=FAA&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Granting Amazon an exemption to allow R&amp;amp;D testing outdoors in the United States is in the public interest because it advances Congress&amp;rsquo;s goal of getting commercial sUAS (small unmanned aircraft systems) flying in the United States safely and soon. It is a necessary step towards realizing the consumer benefits of Amazon Prime Air and, at this point, Amazon&amp;rsquo;s continuing innovation in the United States requires the requested exemption for outdoor testing in support of our R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it more simply, Paul Misener, Amazon&amp;rsquo;s VP of Global Public Policy, told CNET, &amp;ldquo;We want to do more R&amp;amp;D (research and development) close to home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;The letter also outlines Amazon&amp;rsquo;s progress in drone development so far. It says they are working on eighth- and ninth-generation drones that travel over 50 miles per hour and can carry 5-pound packages, which cover 86% of all products sold on Amazon. Amazon's request will go open to the public if it's processed by the FAA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;One day, seeing Amazon Prime Air will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;road&amp;nbsp;today,&amp;nbsp;resulting&amp;nbsp;in enormous benefits for consumers across the nation,&quot; it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-wants-to-test-drones-outside-the-faas-testing-sites-2014-7#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float_right&quot; src=&quot;http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/533c59356da811834cfa19aa-1029-771/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-10.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Satya Nadella Microsoft CEO&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixed into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/microsofts-ceo-email-2014-7&quot;&gt;long memo sent by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to his employees&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was new information about changes to its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, he wants to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/microsofts-ceo-email-2014-7&quot;&gt;measure everything and everyone by a new standard: data. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella is creating something he calls &quot;Data and Applied Science&quot; for every product team. The purpose is &quot;measurable outcomes for our products and predictive analysis of market trends.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn't clarify, but it sounds a lot like what companies like Facebook and Amazon do. They don't guess at new projects and features. They test them, gather data, and make decisions from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sounds as if he's working on a new employee review processes. Former CEO Steve Ballmer ended Microsoft's controversial stack-rank system late last year, a system that pitted employees against each other. Now employees are waiting to hear how their new CEO will judge them in the coming year and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, no details but definite hints that something is in the works. He wrote, &quot;You will see fewer people get involved in decisions and more emphasis on accountability. ... We will increase the fluidity of information and ideas by taking actions to flatten the organization and develop leaner business processes.&lt;strong&gt; Culture change means we will do things differently. Often people think that means everyone other than them.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Nadella is new to the CEO role, remember that he's a longtime Microsoft executive who's been with the company since 1992. Internally, he's known as the guy who gets rid of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/satya-nadella-cuts-drama-management-2014-2&quot;&gt;middle management from the units that he's run.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underneath it all, employees are waiting on information about layoffs from the acquisition of Nokia. There was some subtle language in the memo that news would come soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote, &quot;On July 22, we'll announce our earnings results for the past quarter and I'll say more then on what we are doing in FY15 to focus on our core. &lt;strong&gt;Over the course of July, the Senior Leadership Team and I will share more on the engineering and organization changes we believe are needed.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees won't be surprised to hear about layoffs if they do happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new fiscal year just began on July 1 and a few months earlier, at the end of April, Microsoft closed its mega $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia, adding about 25,000 employees to the roster. Large deals like that almost always involve employee cuts, and there have been a variety of hints since the merger was first announced that Microsoft would be making cuts with this one, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia's handset business in September, it said it would find &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-nokia-powerpoint-2013-9#-21&quot;&gt;$600 million in annual cost savings&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;within 18 months after the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources just told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-10/microsoft-ceo-nadella-outlines-vision-with-more-overhauls.html&quot;&gt;Bloomberg's &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Dina Bass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that trimming $600 million will likely involve trimming jobs in areas where the two companies overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when Ballmer announced the deal, he identified a number of job roles at the company that would need to &quot;integrate.&quot; These included finance, legal, HR, PR, customer support, business development, purchasing, and IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So changes are definitely coming, and everyone is waiting to hear details, hopefully later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to Microsoft to request comment. Microsoft has previously declined comment on upcoming changes to its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoftnokia-employees-fear-layoffs-2014-6&quot; &gt;As Microsoft swallows Nokia, employees are still waiting for news of layoffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The electronics company &lt;a href=&quot;http://phandroid.com/2014/07/09/lg-rollable-display/&quot;&gt;says it's already made an 18-inch screen that rolls up&lt;/a&gt; smaller than a paper towel roll, yet still packs almost a million pixels, Phandroid reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 18 inches is just the beginning. LG says it's &quot;confident that by 2017, we will successfully develop an Ultra HD flexible and transparent OLED panel of more than 60 inches,&quot; Phandroid says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultrathin TV would likely be pretty pricey. LG sells a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-55EA9800-oled-tv&quot;&gt;55-inch OLED TV it bills as &quot;pencil thin&quot;&lt;/a&gt; for $9,000. The transition from pencil thin to paper thin probably won't drive the price down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still with a &lt;span&gt;working and rolling&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;version already existing at 18 inches, LG's super-slim screen could weasel its way into phones, tablets, and phablets before it hits the living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/lg-g3-features-and-photos-2014-5&quot; &gt;LG's new Android phone has the sharpest screen ever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges come from a contract between the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Bell Helicopter Textron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ridiculous markup was over 18 times what the military should have paid for the gears, with DLA overpaying to the tune of $9 million, the IG claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the current contract, the Pentagon would overpay another $2.6 million this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspector General recommended pursuing voluntary recovery for the overpayments, but for now, Bell isn't going along.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell Helicopter&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-08/pentagon-found-to-pay-textron-unit-8-124-for-a-445-gear.html&quot;&gt;&quot;does not agree with the findings or recommendations,&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Andy Woodward, a spokesman for Textron, told Bloomberg in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more waste where to be found, of course. The Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction has uncovered much more, like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/boats-afghanistan-2014-6&quot;&gt;$3 million worth of boats&lt;/a&gt; that were bought and never used sitting idle in a Virginia warehouse and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/ahead-of-2014-pullout-afghanistan-fraud-corruption-money-lost-2013-1&quot;&gt;$6.3 million on vehicles that don't exist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Defense Department also recently settled a case where Boeing overcharged to the alleged tune of $13.7 million. The charges included a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-08/pentagon-found-to-pay-textron-unit-8-124-for-a-445-gear.html&quot;&gt;$10 aluminum pin, which the Pentagon paid $2,286&lt;/a&gt;, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/boats-afghanistan-2014-6&quot; &gt;US Wasted Millions On Boats For Land-Locked Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, the city &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-banned-monkey-parking-app-2014-6&quot;&gt;issued a cease and desist letter to the company&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;which lets users auction off the parking spaces their cars occupy to others looking for spots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now MonkeyParking says it's taking time to evaluate its service and clarify its value proposition to &quot;avoid any future misunderstandings,&quot; the blog post says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Street parking is currently not a first-come-first-served process, but still a random-served one:&amp;nbsp;you can go in circles for hours while a&amp;nbsp;lucky driver can find a spot in a minute, right in front of you,&quot; the blog, which was addressed to all &quot;MonkeyParkers,&quot; said. The city, however, doesn't think it's fair to auction off public property for private profit. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/monkey-parking-ignores-san-francisco-2014-6&quot;&gt;MonkeyParking insists that the app simply helps users auction off information&lt;/a&gt;, though clearly the city isn't buying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every parking app is going, however. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carmanation.com/&quot;&gt;CARMAnation&lt;/a&gt; relies on private driveways, and thus is unaffected by the city's policy on public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You cannot monetize public assets for individual company gain. Just because an app can be built, doesn't mean it should be,&quot; CEO and cofounder of CARMAnation told Business Insider in an email. &quot;Our users share their PRIVATE available spots with one another. We aren't looking to make a profit by taking advantage of the city or its residents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MonkeyParking, too, assures that not only is it working for the good of the people of San Francisco, but also that it will be back soon, it said on its blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/madrids-new-smart-parking-meters-2014-7&quot; &gt;Madrid's news smart parking meter knows what you drive and punishes gas guzzlers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything is centered around our sense of humor,&quot; Matt Rutledge, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mediocre.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mediocre Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;, and thus Meh.com, told Business Insider.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the idea: Every day, for exactly 24 hours starting at midnight EST, Meh will sell exactly one product. That's it. Once the day is over, a new product will get its chance in the 24-hour spotlight. Meh has no automatic emails or social media presence &amp;mdash; it's&amp;nbsp;just the site, the product (hilariously described &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;today's deal revolved around the idea o&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/zack-brown-potato-salad-kickstarter-2014-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;f the potato salad of Kickstarter infamy&lt;/a&gt;), a poll, and a video.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meh has only been live since July 9. Today, you can buy a Speck iPad Mini case for $5. On Day One, the site sold&amp;nbsp;Roomba 560 vacuums, described on the site as &quot;the hottest floor-cleaning robots of 2007.&quot; Not overly impressed by the selection? Well, &quot;meh&quot; is the mantra of the site, after all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float_right&quot; src=&quot;http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53bf17ef69bedd8b14a6d855-444-349/screen shot 2014-07-10 at 6.46.30 pm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Meh.com&quot; /&gt;Meh also lists each day's live stats. At right are the stats so far from the Speck sale. Previously,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meh.com/deals/irobot-roomba-560&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meh sold 315 Roombas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(220,200 people visited the site total), netting $58,238.16, counting shipping and tax.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutledge is an e-commerce veteran. He&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/dear-woot-employees-heres-why-we-just-sold-to-amazon-2010-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sold his daily-deals company Woot&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to Amazon for $110 million in 2010. He stayed at Amazon until June 2012, leaving a year before he was supposed to according to his deal with Amazon. At that point, Woot looked a lot different: The site had become more complicated and had lost a lot of the quirky humor that had originally enticed fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meh is Rutledge's version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://meh.com/forum/topics/faq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;turning back time&lt;/a&gt;. Woot lost its original vision because of the pressure to grow. At Meh, there's no pressure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://meh.com/forum/topics/faq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Its FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; puts it plainly: &quot;Oh,&amp;nbsp;we have no idea if this&amp;rsquo;ll work. See, that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s an experiment.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The underlying premise is that we're building a store that you don't need to buy anything from to have fun,&quot; Ruttledge told Business Insider. &quot;We're proud of testing that.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meh is only one of several experiments that Mediocre Laboratories is working on. Several others are code-named on the site, including Wohler, which asks if the community can create a &quot;crap distribution network,&quot; and Jensen, which explores different price scenarios around the idea that humans are the only animals that can feel spite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It wouldn't be fair to say all those ideas are good ideas and that we'll do them,&quot; Rutledge says. &quot;But it's an in-progress list of things that show how we think. Those are the ideas that we have fun introducing to each other.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Mediocre teams rolls about 35 people deep. They may not know exactly which e-commerce experiment they'll tackle next, but Rutledge is excited for the journey regardless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The community is really the most important part,&quot; he says. &quot;The sense of loss when you sell a business when it has a community is immense, and if you let that community down, that's your fault. So having a chance to become reacquainted with old friends and see that community come back alive means everything to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check out the video included with the Speck case sale today. It&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;features something called &quot;Mad Ape Den&quot; Karaoke, where you have to sing a popular song only using words with three letters or fewer. Rutledge says that he and some members of the Mediocre team have been &quot;doing stupid things on the internet since the '90s,&quot; and Mad Ape Den is an example of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's Mediocre 's Dennis performing the Mad Ape Den version of Tubthumping:&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float_right&quot; src=&quot;http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53bf1a4d6da811236af4c835-480-/uber-travis-kalanick.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;uber travis kalanick&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uber is hiring &lt;span&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and not just in San Francisco where the car-sharing service has become ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uber.com/jobs/list&quot;&gt;job listings&lt;/a&gt; show just how ambitious its plans are.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Novosobirsk, Russia? What about Ahmedabad, India? Uber has a job for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the positions are pretty nebulous. Just what does someone in &quot;Asia Expansion&quot; do?&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Set up shop wherever it's needed, it seems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At base, this job entails being dropped into a city or country where Uber has zero brand and physical presence, quickly figuring out who and what make that city run, and then building a new business from scratch &amp;mdash; in a matter of weeks &amp;mdash; which sets Uber up for long-term success,&quot; says the job description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like Uber is looking for Marines with MBAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides a &quot;unique, ground floor opportunity,&quot; Uber offers free rides as a perk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's job listings are so numerous, it's easier to figure out where they're&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;not&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plurality of job are in either San Francisco or spread across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe isn't out of the picture, though. Uber is looking for employees in far-flung cities like Prague, St. Petersburg and Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handful of jobs are &quot;multi-city,&quot; meaning those employees will likely hop from place to place and help Uber get set up across a broader region like Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uber.com/jobs/list&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can check out the full listing of jobs at Uber's site &amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-job-listings-2014-7#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float_right&quot; src=&quot;http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/53bf19bcecad04bd7aee5531-480-/barack-obama-491.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Barack Obama&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House on Thursday reacted to House Speaker John Boehner &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/boehner-lawsuit-obama-2014-7&quot;&gt;officially releasing&lt;/a&gt; details of his lawsuit against Barack Obama by reiterating the president's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-calls-boehners-lawsuit-a-stunt-2014-6&quot;&gt;earlier claim&lt;/a&gt; the suit was nothing but a &quot;stunt&quot; that wastes taxpayer dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is disappointing that Speaker Boehner and Congressional Republicans have decided to waste time and taxpayer dollars on a political stunt. At a time when Washington should be working to expand economic opportunities for the middle class, Republican leaders in Congress are playing Washington politics rather than working with the President on behalf of hardworking Americans,&quot; the White House press secretary said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehner's lawsuit, which was outlined earlier in the day with a draft resolution set to be filed in the House of Representatives, focuses on Obama's 2013 decision to unilaterally delay the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In 2013, the president changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it. That&amp;rsquo;s not the way our system of government was designed to work. No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own,&quot; Boehner said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the White House argued Boehner's lawsuit was a sign that Congress simply isn't doing its job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As the President said today, he is doing his job &amp;ndash; lawsuit or not &amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s time Republicans in Congress did theirs,&quot; the press secretary added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-slams-boehners-disappointing-lawsuit-2014-7#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>

This has led some Republicans to wonder whether the foundation funds political operations for Clinton, who is considered the Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election. However, a source close to Clinton told Business Insider she &quot;personally&quot; pays for her staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Secretary's personal staff is paid for by her personally,&quot; the source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source also noted Clinton draws no salary from the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the conservative America Rising PAC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americarisingpac.org/5-burning-questions-hillary-clintons-university-paydays-clinton-foundation/&quot;&gt;published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; featuring five &quot;burning questions&quot; about the finances of the&amp;nbsp;Bill, Hillary &amp;amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation. One of the group's questions was about Clinton's staff, which includes spokespeople and other aides.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is the Foundation paying for Clinton&amp;rsquo;s political staff or being used as a holding ground for future Clinton Presidential staff?&quot; the group asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican National Committee Press Secretary Kirsten Kukowski also questioned the Foundation's finances in an email sent Wednesday in response to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/us/politics/chelsea-clinton-follows-parents-lead-as-a-paid-speaker.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;a New York Times article published earlier that day&lt;/a&gt;. The newspaper article&amp;nbsp;noted Chelsea Clinton gives all of her income from speaking fees to the Bill, Hillary &amp;amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Kukowski's email noted &quot;there aren&amp;rsquo;t any documents to prove&quot; Hillary Clinton gives speaking fees to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Might be time for some&amp;nbsp;transparency&amp;nbsp;from the Clinton Foundation,&quot; she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-personally-pays-for-her-own-staff-2014-7#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>

&lt;p&gt;Boehner's office released a draft &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.house.gov/meetings/RU/RU00/20140716/102507/BILLS-113pih-HRes___.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday of the resolution set to be filed in the House of Representatives, which would authorize the chamber to take legal action against the president.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Today we&amp;rsquo;re releasing a draft resolution that will authorize the House to file suit over the way President Obama unilaterally changed the employer mandate,&quot; Boehner said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;In 2013, the president changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it. That&amp;rsquo;s not the way our system of government was designed to work. No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The House Rules Committee will consider the draft resolution next Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehner has hinted at the lawsuit for weeks, arguing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/boehner-suing-obama-lawsuit-2014-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Obama has continually overstepped his constitutional authority&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Boehner sent a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/boehner-obama-sue-lawsuit-impeachment-executive-actions-2014-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memo to the House Republican conference late last month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;, informing them of his plans to file legislation in July that would allow the House of Representatives to file suit to compel Obama to &quot;faithfully execute the laws of our country.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;He wrote in a CNN.com op-ed on Sunday that the House could target a number of specific executive actions as fodder for its lawsuit, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obama's actions with regard to the Affordable Care Act, energy regulations, foreign policy, and education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph10&quot;&gt;The White House and the president himself have jokingly dismissed the lawsuit. On Thursday, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-slams-boehners-disappointing-lawsuit-2014-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;White House press secretary Josh Earnest called the plans&lt;/a&gt; for a suit a &quot;political stunt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is disappointing that Speaker Boehner and Congressional Republicans have decided to waste time and taxpayer dollars on a political stunt,&quot; Earnest said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At a time when Washington should be working to expand economic opportunities for the middle class, Republican leaders in Congress are playing Washington politics rather than working with the President on behalf of hardworking Americans. As the President said today, he is doing his job &amp;ndash; lawsuit or not &amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s time Republicans in Congress did theirs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph10&quot;&gt;Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, also blasted Boehner's plan in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph10&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Time and again, House Republicans&amp;rsquo; total abdication of responsibility has forced the President to act,&quot; Hammill said. &quot;They&amp;rsquo;ve wasted billions of taxpayer dollars forcing a downgrade of the U.S. economy and a shutdown of the federal government, and now, after wasting millions defending discrimination in the federal courts, the resolution unveiled tonight would authorize hiring more partisan lawyers for yet another legal boondoggle doomed to fail.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph10&quot;&gt;The Obama administration &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/obamacare-employer-mandate-delayed-year-2013-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first delayed a year ago the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;, which&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;requires most businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to provide health insurance meeting certain minimum criteria &amp;mdash; or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph10&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In February, the administration announced it&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;will&amp;nbsp;delay the mandate's penalty another year for small businesses with 50-99 workers. It said it would also adjust some of the requirements for larger employers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new Treasury Department rules, businesses&amp;nbsp;with 100 employees or more must offer coverage to at least 70% of full-time workers in 2015 and 95% in 2016, or face a penalty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/boehner-lawsuit-obama-2014-7#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>

                        &lt;p&gt;There's only one true way to compare military strength, and thankfully we haven't had the opportunity to compare powerful countries in recent decades &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; though with&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-south-china-sea-graphic-2014-7&quot;&gt; a powder keg in the South China Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/r-more-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-france-germany-press-putin-2014-10&quot;&gt;standoffs in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-middle-east-will-be-on-fire-for-a-while-2014-6&quot;&gt; proxy wars throughout the Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, we are alarmingly close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a simpler evaluation of military power, we turn to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Firepower Index&lt;/a&gt;, a ranking of 106 nations based on&amp;nbsp;more than 50 factors including overall military budget, available manpower, and the amount of equipment each country has in their respective arsenals, as well as access to resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index focuses on quantity, ignoring significant quantitative differences (North Korea's 78 submarines, for instance, aren't exactly state of the art). It also does not factor in&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/map-all-of-the-worlds-nukes-2014-7&quot;&gt; nuclear stockpiles&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; still the ultimate trump card in geopolitics. It also does not&amp;nbsp;penalize land-locked nations for lack of a standing navy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've created a chart to compare the top 35 militaries according to the Global Firepower Index. The ranking, released in April 2014, involves a complex set of data that is subject to ongoing adjustments and corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot; class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;clear-both&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;KonaBody post-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53be9f7eecad048131d9baa1-2500-4869/bi_graphics_globalfirepowerindex.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Global Firepower Index Graphic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are key findings from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp&quot;&gt;the index&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;America's Investment In Being The World's Police Force&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States clearly leads the world in military spending at more than $600 billion. China is the closest nation to follow the US at nearly $130 billion &amp;mdash; which is still less than a third of America's overall spending.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a report from t&lt;span&gt;he&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&amp;nbsp;(SIPRI)&lt;/a&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;US has reduced its defense budget by 7.8% chiefly due to America's gradual withdrawal in overseas military operations, like Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Russia has increased its arms spending by $88 billion and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42006.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plans to 'modernize'&lt;/a&gt; its current weapons arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Role Of Aircraft Carriers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aircraft carriers contribute greatly to a country's overall military strength. These massive vessels allow nations to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/uss-eisenhower-persian-gulf-imcmex-2012-2014-2&quot;&gt;project their force&lt;/a&gt; far beyond their borders and across the entire face of the globe by functioning as essentially a mobile naval and air force base. Aircraft carriers can also carry drones, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/drone-carrier-capability-changes-game-military-2013-5&quot;&gt;significantly changing&lt;/a&gt; the global surveillance game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S.'s absolute monopoly on these vessels significantly boosts the country's forward operating power. The U.S. has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/14/aircraft-carrier-iraq-isis-strike-persian-gulf&quot;&gt;deployed&lt;/a&gt; an aircraft carrier towards the Persian Gulf to bolster its sea and air power before possible strikes against ISIS in Iraq. Russia has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-deploys-admiral-kuznetsov-carrier-2013-6&quot;&gt;previously deployed&lt;/a&gt; an aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean to display its seriousness in propping up Assad in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;North Korea's Submarines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anomaly in the Global Firepower index is North Korea's ranking as a world leader for submarines. North Korea's submarine lead is due to the fact that the country, in terms of pure numbers, has more submarines than any country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these submarine are almost entirely unusable. A third of North Korea's subs are noisy diesel powered Romeos, which have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/kim-jong-un-mans-a-soviet-submarine-thats-been-obsolete-since-1961-photos-2014-6&quot;&gt;obsolete since 1961&lt;/a&gt;. These submarines have a weapon's range of only four miles, whereas a modern U.S. submarine has a weapon's range of 150 miles. By and large, this fleet is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.defense.gov/pubs/North_Korea_Military_Power_Report_2013-2014.pdf&quot;&gt;unsophisticated but durable&lt;/a&gt;, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #222222; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/map-all-of-the-worlds-nukes-2014-7&quot; &gt;MAP: All 17,000 Of The World's Nukes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        <description>
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float_right&quot; src=&quot;http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53bf104969bedd0c71a6d858-480-/steve-stockman-4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Steve Stockman&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congressman Steve Stockman (R-Texas) took the IRS tax scandal to the next level Thursday by calling for the House to actually arrest Lois Lerner, the former IRS official &lt;a href=&quot;contemnor&quot;&gt;who is accused&lt;/a&gt; of selectively targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny while applying for tax-exempt status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;How much longer will the House allow itself to be mocked?&quot; Stockman asked. &quot;It is up to this House to uphold the rule of law and hold accountable those who illegally targeted American citizens for simply having different ideas than the President.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Stockman is the pol to call for Lerner's arrest won't come as a surprise to observers of his recent political career. The outgoing congressman ran what reporters widely described as a bizarre campaign when he unsuccessfully primaried Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) this year. During that race, among other things, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2014/01/rep-steve-stockman-emerges-online-says-hes-been-in-russia-israel-and-egypt-on-official-business.html/&quot;&gt;disappeared from the campaign trail&lt;/a&gt;. Stockman was also &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/steve-stockman-twitter-texas-congressman.html&quot;&gt;once praised&lt;/a&gt; by New York magazine for being one of Congress' greatest trolls &amp;mdash; an internet term for someone who deliberately goes out of his way to provoke an angry response from his opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Stockman's press release justified his call for Lerner's arrest by recalling the time House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi claimed the House &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/nancy-pelosi-contempt-darrell-issa_n_1613086.html?1340218706&quot;&gt;could have done the same&lt;/a&gt; to Republican strategist Karl Rove. Stockman asserted his position was actually more moderate because he wanted to send Lerner to the Washington DC prison system instead imprisoning her in the Capitol building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Democrats have openly stated the House has the powers to arrest those in contempt of Congress and imprison them in the Capitol. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go as far as Democrats in exercising the House&amp;rsquo;s powers to arrest.&amp;nbsp; Ms. Lerner will be held in the D.C. jail,&quot; said Stockman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also claimed it's expected for Democrats to cheer criminal behavior and asked if the House Republican leadership would join them by dismissing his resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Asking the Justice Department to prosecute Lois Lerner for admittedly illegal activity is a joke. The Obama administration will not prosecute the Obama administration,&quot; he said. &quot;It&amp;rsquo;s time to for House to stop tacitly endorsing this administration&amp;rsquo;s illegal activity by refusing to hold him accountable. I expect Democrats to defend and even praise criminal activity. The question is whether Republican leadership will join them in mocking the House and breaking the law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View Stockman's resolution below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;RESOLUTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Providing for the arrest of Lois G. Lerner to answer the charge of contempt of Congress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Whereas Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt Organizations, Internal Revenue Service, has been found to be in contempt of Congress for willfully and intentionally refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, thereby obstructing the Congress in the lawful exercise of its constitutionally mandated legislative powers; and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Whereas such behavior is an insult to the dignity of the House of Representatives, an attack upon the integrity of its proceedings, works violence upon the rights of the House collectively, and therefore implicates the long-recognized inherent power of the House to punish and commit for contempt, privileged under the Constitution; and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Whereas recent history with similarly contumacious and insolent witnesses such as Eric Himpton Holder, Junior, strongly suggests that the present statutory judicial rubric set up to punish and reform such insubordinate and obstructionist witnesses would be ineffective in this case, as it is likely that the US Attorney for the District of Columbia would refuse to perform his lawful duty to bring the offending contemnor Lerner before a Grand Jury and prosecute the same for her misconduct pursuant to section 104 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (2 U.S.C. 194) and section 102 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (2 U.S.C. 192); and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Whereas the executive and judicial branches&amp;rsquo; prolonged and dawdling failure to prosecute Attorney General Holder&amp;rsquo;s insolent contempt of the 112th Congress strongly suggests that a like proceeding against contemnor Lerner would be similarly futile, and the threat of such prosecution has clearly been insufficient to encourage contemnor Lerner to be honest and candid with the Congress regarding the heinous actions of the Internal Revenue Service;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Now, therefore, be it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;Resolved, That the Speaker issue his warrant, directed to the Sergeant-at-Arms, or his deputy, commanding him to arrest and take into custody forthwith, wherever to be found, the body of Lois G. Lerner, and bring her to the bar of the House without delay to answer to the charge of contempt of its authority, breach of its privileges, and gross and wanton insult to the integrity of its proceedings, and in the meantime keep the body of Lerner in his custody in the common jail of the District of Columbia, subject to the further order of the House. While in custody, Lerner shall enjoy no special privileges beyond those extended to her fellow inmates, shall not access any computer or telephone, and shall not be visited by anyone other than her counsel, clergy, physician, or family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/congressman-wants-ex-irs-official-lois-lerner-arrested-2014-7#comments&quot;&gt;Join the conversation about this story &amp;#187;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    </description>

                                        <description>
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;float_right&quot; src=&quot;http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/53befe0feab8ea057740fa12-480-/bezos-final-0404web-2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;bezos final 0404_web&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon launched on Wednesday a challenger to Box and Dropbox: an &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/zocalo/&quot;&gt;enterprise cloud file storage service called Zocalo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Zocalo allows you to access and share files on any type of device, Amazon says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;The service costs just $5 per user per month and comes with 200GB of storage and no other software requirements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Companies that use Amazon WorkSpaces &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;get free storage up to 50GB, or can elect to pay $2 a month per user for the entire 200GB. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Amazon WorkSpaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gives employees access to Windows 7 in the cloud, which can be accessed on any device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;While Amazon is already popular with enterprises for its cloud-computing storage offerings, those are used mostly by IT professionals. Amazon hasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly been a major player when it comes to enterprise apps used by&amp;nbsp; ordinary workers. But Zocalo is a move in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;As Janakiram MSV, &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.gigaom.com/2014/07/amazon-zocalo-disrupting-cloud-storage-collaboration-and-desktop-as-a-service/?utm_source=cloud&amp;amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;amp;utm_campaign=intext&amp;amp;utm_term=856653+yup-aws-dives-into-mobile-services-but-watch-out-box-collaboration-and-doc-sharing-too&amp;amp;utm_content=gigabarb&quot;&gt;principal analyst at Janakiram &amp;amp; Associates, says,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Zocalo is an indication of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s ambitious plan to become the one-stop shop for enterprise IT.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;In response to his newest big competitor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geekwire.com/2014/amazon-jumps-enterprise-collaboration-zocalo/&quot;&gt;Box CEO Aaron Levie said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, according to Geekwire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot; style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's an incredibly exciting time for the cloud content category, and Amazon&amp;rsquo;s entry underscores the scale of the market opportunity. Amazon Zocalo looks like a useful service for file storage and sharing. At Box, we&amp;rsquo;re laser focused on offering the security, scalability, collaboration and cross-platform support that enterprises require to be more productive and competitive across workforces of hundreds of thousands of employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;Amazon Zocalo is currently available only for limited preview. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to get on the waiting list, you can sign up &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/zocalo/limited-preview/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Here are some screenshots of Zocalo:&lt;/p&gt;
