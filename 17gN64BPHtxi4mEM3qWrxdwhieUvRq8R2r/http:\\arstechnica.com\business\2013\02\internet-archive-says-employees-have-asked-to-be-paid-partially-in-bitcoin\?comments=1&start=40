Internet Archive says some employees have asked to be paid partially in Bitcoin
Group is asking for your donations in the Internet's "local currency."

It seems like every week or so Bitcoin moves further into the mainstream.
Most recently, it was online gambling. In November, even WordPress started taking payment in the digital currency. Last year, a Bitcoin bank was launched.
And on Thursday, the Internet Archive announced that it wants to collect donations, in Bitcoin, so that it can pay some employees, at their request—part of their salary, if they so choose—in Bitcoin. The online archive's mission is to store digital documents, including, most notably, previous versions of webpages.
If all goes well, wrote Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle, the move will start in April 2013. “We hope to make it a continuing option," he added.
The group's address is: 17gN64BPHtxi4mEM3qWrxdwhieUvRq8R2r.
Kahle wrote the day before that Bitcoin is the “local currency” of the Internet.
“There are local currencies like Ithaca Hours or Bernal Bucks that facilitate trading within a community. Bitcoins are kind of like that. It is for those of the Internet,” he wrote. “I found getting it going was an adventure which ended in my figuring out how to donate to the Internet Archive, which was fun. People have donated over $5,000 worth of bitcoins in the last 2 years to the Internet Archive.”
Disclosure: Cyrus Farivar and Ars contributor Tim Lee both own some bitcoins.

The reason for this is that with rapid fluctuation of rates and occasional drops, we do not want to be left holding a worthless bag if the rate drops for some reason. We update prices on a daily basis to reflect this 50Cent rule."There's a lot of faith there in value of a bitcoin.

Every currency acts like a stock, its just a matter of to what degree/at what scope. Otherwise there wouldn't be a Forex market. Bitcoin's volatility will decrease as adoption and usage increases. More players in the market will drive down the margins and create a common base-line for pricing.It's also important to realize that a bitcoin is the largest denomination, and will not remain the primary unit. A likely choice is the mircobit, because then it imitates major fiscal currencies and lets the satoishi be worth 1 cent of a mircobit. a bitcoin would then be a million ubits. Some may argue for leaving the bitcoin as the primary value but then the denominations would be a descending scale where as all other traditional currencies are ascending in nature. Adding excessive amount of decimals and powers of ten will just confuse people. The primary unit needs to be '1' for all basic level transactions. Tech wise this is just a simple moving of the decimal place. Socially though, this means people have to think about money in dynamic terms until the system as a whole has stabilized and the value of 1 unit can be established. This is why people see it as a stock or commodity currently. To everyday people, the value of a dollar is static, when in reality its not. Its just that its value fluctuates so little that base unit value is unaffected.

Do journalists for financial papers, when writing about fluctuations in American currency write "Disclosure: My salary and retirement fund are both in US dollars." Seems a bit odd..It's a good-faith attempt at transparency. Financial writers typically disclose if they have a financial stake in companies/funds/securities/other instruments they're writing about.Yes, but not currencies.Bitcoin is very much not a currency. It is a speculative instrument, backed by absolutely no state, whose value has fluctuated wildly.I am also having difficulty recalling an Ars Technica articles about the US dollar, or any other major currency.

If this is successful we hope to make it a continuing option.What is the problem here?/grumble I swear Bitcoin articles bring out the worst commenters.Grumble all you want but it would get you docked in your Journalism class. It is a "head bust." The headline is stating that the fact the employees that has already happened. The story posits a possibility but never states anything about the employees having already asked for it. The online/copy editor should know better when writing the article and a Senior editor should not let it stand without correction.Usually such an option appears when people ask. Bitcoin is not yet something that is routinely used for payment by mainstream companies. The Archive is not a company that you would expect to be offering to pay wages in Bitcoin. They state that they are making it available to those that choose the option and need donations to cover the expected payments.Employees asked for the optionThe option is made available as requested,Employees must now file a formal request per company procedure to choose to avail the option...Nothing difficult to understand unless you work at it.

Of course there is certainly a real risk: another currency collapse.Those are the sneaky employees attempting to claw back their expired Bush Tax Cuts by reducing their taxable income an equivalent amount.Actually they are taking a risk on exchange rates. They are getting paid based on the exchange rate the day the paycheck is calculated ... at the end of the year the IRS requires all non-USD currencies to be reported as their US dollar value based on the exchange rate current at the time the tax return is filled out. This instruction is clearly stated in the free Pubs available on the irs.gov website.

Anytime the payee and payor use different currencies expect an exchange fee. The pizza parlor is simply tacking on a US$0.50 currency exchange fee though they choose not to call it that.

How often do Ars writers tackle stories about currency that is not bitcoin?2. It should probably be assumed that a person that exists in the state that mandates a particular currency would possess amounts of that currency. Bitcoin is not (as far as I know) an official currency in the US, or elsewhere, and there could be a real concern for people with an interest in the currency to encourage speculation in it to drive up their own value.Sadly, I haven't yet needed to mention the fact that I hold Z$50,000,000,000 (http://bit.ly/VARTIQ). :-)Are all tech journalists multimillionaires like you? More like multibillionaires.Pfft, lightweights. I have Z$600,000,000,000,000.
