Internet Archive says some employees have asked to be paid partially in Bitcoin
Group is asking for your donations in the Internet's "local currency."
by Cyrus Farivar

It seems like every week or so Bitcoin moves further into the mainstream.
Most recently, it was online gambling. In November, even WordPress started taking payment in the digital currency. Last year, a Bitcoin bank was launched.
And on Thursday, the Internet Archive announced that it wants to collect donations, in Bitcoin, so that it can pay some employees, at their request—part of their salary, if they so choose—in Bitcoin. The online archive's mission is to store digital documents, including, most notably, previous versions of webpages.
If all goes well, wrote Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle, the move will start in April 2013. “We hope to make it a continuing option," he added.
The group's address is: 17gN64BPHtxi4mEM3qWrxdwhieUvRq8R2r.
Kahle wrote the day before that Bitcoin is the “local currency” of the Internet.
“There are local currencies like Ithaca Hours or Bernal Bucks that facilitate trading within a community. Bitcoins are kind of like that. It is for those of the Internet,” he wrote. “I found getting it going was an adventure which ended in my figuring out how to donate to the Internet Archive, which was fun. People have donated over $5,000 worth of bitcoins in the last 2 years to the Internet Archive.”
Disclosure: Cyrus Farivar and Ars contributor Tim Lee both own some bitcoins.

What's the benefit of being paid in bitcoins? Tax evasion? Of course there is certainly a real risk: another currency collapse.

Not to be a douche, but the article title says 'some employee's have asked' and the article content says nothing about employees, just that they're accepting it as a donation..

As long as Bitcoins remain stable, you stand to save a lot more that normally would be wasted on overhead.Edit: Revised processing fee for VISA to lowest rate available.

Seems a bit odd..The reason we disclose our bitcoin holdings is because it's still a relatively small thing that's still fluctuating quite a bit, price-wise. (We've also previously covered its rise and fall, see: http://ars.to/Yrdyjs.) We would do the same thing if we held stocks in companies that we were writing about. For what it's worth, bitcoin's value has been rapidly rising, and has breached $30 per BTC, according to MtGox.com.

Out of all of the Google, Microsoft and Apple articles I don't recall disclosures for owning stock in those companies. I assume Ars or Conde do not prohibit investing in particular companies, so I assume then the disclosures are not a company policy?Though I could be wrong and maybe it is corporate policy not to own stock in companies that you report on?

I appreciate the disclosure. As long as bitcoin continues to act as a commodity price wise (something I'd bet real money on) it should be treated like a stock or investment opportunity (with the proviso that any commodity that does $30 to $5 to $30 in a few years doesn't seem like a great long term investment).

Internet Archive post: "Some Internet Archive employees have elected to receive some of their pay in Bitcoin in April. If this is successful we hope to make it a continuing option."Ars post: "And on Thursday, the Internet Archive announced that it wants to collect donations, in Bitcoin, so that it can pay its employees—some of their salary, if they so choose—in Bitcoin. "At this point I'd say it's a semantic argument between elected vs asked.

Which of course is not the case, and it would be dishonest to pretend otherwise.

It would help draw some donations if there were a page listing donations along with some unique indication to identify the transaction to the donor (probably the temporary bitcoin address used to send that contribution). Feedback via email works for non-anonymous donations, but an anonymous bitcoin donation should not require compromise of anonymity.Feedback is needed to keep confidence at a high level that none of the funds disappear into someone's pocket, rather than supporting the intended purpose. People at Internet Archive are themselves making a valuable contribution by their efforts, and are probably unusually well-intentioned. The reason for the feedback would be to avoid even the slightest doubt about anything that would reduce support for the project.Of course, they also need to consider how much effort this would require, vs. what else they could accomplish by not redirecting that effort.

It is interesting to note that among the many organizations now accepting bitcoin donations besides the Internet Archive is the Students for Liberty campus organization.I'd love to be paid in bitcoins if my stodgy old 20th Century employer would agree to such an arrangement, but I'm afraid hell will freeze over before that can happen.

However, I may be willing to risk a small part of it...

Of course there is certainly a real risk: another currency collapse.The Internet Archive would not want to risk their non-profit status, so they will likely report it properly to the IRS. How to deal with "payment in kind" (anything other than dollars) is well understood by them.Aside from the geek value of having a screen popup that says "You've got money", if you work in a different country than the employer, or you want to send funds to relatives, it's easier because bitcoin is transnational, and you don't have to mess with bank wires (expensive), western union, or PayPal (doesn't go everywhere) to cross borders.International transactions, and micro-transactions are the two places bitcoin is better than the alternatives. For example, some topics on reddit.com have enabled bitcoin tips in the comments. Imagine that, getting money from other people for good comments!Also, you can order pizza with it: http://pizzaforcoins.com/

Small nations, but still nations. Considering it was below last place two years ago, that is pretty impressive growth.As for number in circulation, it's 1.08 quadrillion Satoshi (the smallest bitcoin unit). It's just the value of 1 BTC isn't large enough for many transactions in that unit. Currently people talk in terms of full coins, or milli-coins (worth 3 US cents), but a Satoshi is 0.01 micro-coins, which is another 100,000 times smaller.If you open up http://blockchain.info/ you can watch some 8 decimal values go past.You are correct that at the present time bitcoin behaves like a stock with similar market capitalization. It's really only been in use for two years, and a lot of the software and apps for it are still in development. I think of it like a tech start-up. Eventually people will figure out what uses it is good for, and word about it will get past the tech and finance community, and the distribution of new coins will settle down (in 4 years it will reduce to 4% new coins a year). If you want stability, wait till then.
