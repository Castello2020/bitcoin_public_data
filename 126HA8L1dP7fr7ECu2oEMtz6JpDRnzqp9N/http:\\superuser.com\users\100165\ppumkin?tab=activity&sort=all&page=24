System Slows when i switch between windows based Applications and Linux based Applications in Ubuntu 10.04
why dont you try running ubuntu VM on Windows instead... since you are using windows apps mostly and then ubuntu... for whatever other reason

Windows Live Mail doesn't respond to clicking Allow Sender
Almost like a COM object.. Obviously Windows and Office developers have access to kernel level functions and objects.. which is all written in C/C++ ... which makes debugging (or hacking) more complicated.

you might find it hard to believe but most Office products use the IE component. The process name will be the actual program but whatever is used inside is most likely an IE window.. but it does not use .NET.. instead Office directly interfaces with the correct DLL's and can hide/masquerade components anyway they like. But it is strange that a new install gives you this issue.

seems strange- something is blocking the click.. you might also want to try lower intranet settings.. or if you have antivirus with internet security.. check those settings.. it is todo with with popup blockin.. or running local scripts.. because that is an IE window

close outlook and any other office app.. go to control panel -> internet settings. Reset everything. Restart-- should work

Virtual Printer to POST web form
sounds like you need a freelancer to develop some code for you... what you are asking sound pretty specific

word 2010 spell checker chokes on Camel Case
yea - the complaining is correct.. because it is grammatically correct. not technically correct. Unfortunately for this purpose you need to get a technical dictionary or some other kind of checker.. or mark technical terms to be ignored..

Sharing VPN access between two computers on the LAN
installing a VPN router on your side should help you get all computers to access the VPN'ed network.. but i think both sided needs it.. hence comment only not answer

Permanently delete files from a flash drive It was requested by the government on those basis you mentioned to be implemented into each intel based computer so that data can be disposed off in a safe way to re use hardware on low level security.(eg public health sector-which is always under paid) Any high level security hardware.. gets Nuked from orbit or smashed to dust.. not banged with a hammer.. or melted into a door stop.

Permanently delete files from a flash drive Nuking from space (+1) and smashing to dust- yes.. destroys everything.. but bashing a few times with a hammer.... not really- that all i am saying.. INCINERATE IT :)

Permanently delete files from a flash drive Strange... Because i tested that on platter drives and ssd's - using a few nice tools winhex forensics, mhdd, pc3k... seems that the bios erase works pretty well- and yes- it is still used to fix bad sectors-especially after p-listing...

Possible to rotate video (.MOV/H.264/AVC) losslessly?
Yea something like that- you have to save(export) it but the Mac version of iLife uses the full capabilities of quicktime to quickly "re-encode" it.. Quicktime on Windows is limited. I borrowed a buddues mac to do it, resonably quick. But i realised i made a mistake, and re-encoded a 1 and half hour movie on windows..... 2 days...

Permanently delete files from a flash drive @ScottPack If you do a LLF on a SSF, the clustering(the wear leveing) gets reset and can never be reconstructed again - because the the clusters have been overwritten with new wear -leveling data, hence the data is gone. The same applies to HDD- if you take the PCB away from the HDD.. The rom contains the data clusters- with out that its just a pile of random bits.Just on an HDD there is no need to implement the wear-level method. Even the best forensics detectives will cringe when they have to recover data with out the cluster data

HI - using iMovie export.. will export it rotated.. on windows.. it does not re flag it.. So 1- Import into iMovie(on a mac) 2-Export to HD-HQ 3-Play on windows(will be rotated to proper aspect) Quicktime on Mac supports proper on the fly transcoding with minimum quality loss) Thats what i meant.

Permanently delete files from a flash drive The goverment does not use hammers to destroy data- this answer is misleading and does not deserve upvotes. Using BIOS IMPLEMENTED LOW LEVEL FORMAT GUARANTEES TO WIPE DATA TO GOVERMENT STANDARDS! Then you can incinerate it if you want.. but even a cracked SMD can be recovered!! You can use HDD LLF Low Level Format Tool

Two network connections are available to Windows 7 — which will it use?
This is an interesting subject as i have wondered it myself.. it does seem to like wireless more than LAN.. and find it annoying when i disconnect WIFI during copy with LAN plugged it... it fails.. This does not happen on LINUX though.. thanks winblows...
