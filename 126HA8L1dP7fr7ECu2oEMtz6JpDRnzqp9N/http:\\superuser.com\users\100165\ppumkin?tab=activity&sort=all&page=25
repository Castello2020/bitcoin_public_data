Is USB Data + wire supposed to have grounding?
I cannot see why the same wire would be better than the other. There obviously is a problem(or the red wires are another size) than the ground.. a wire is a wire and is constrained by amp and its thickness.

What does length, height and depth refer to on a PCI card?
If you are using this as a refence to desingin something.. it is a rally really reallllly bad sketch to use.. it is missing the front plate, missing the mini sized sizes.. i dont know my self if 106.8 is what is that? the front plate or the card.. find another source.. or get your own card.. Usually the PCB it self can be different heights. PS i dont long PCI card are in use anymore... Unless in servers

Just want to send emails from my Ubuntu Server. What simple SMTP server solution to use?
using postfix or sendmail is fine to send- by default it wont recieve emails but allow you too if you want in the future. Also easy to implement form webpage using php send mail features.

Not all ram usable?
You cannot trick the OS into thinking it has more ram- it would cause serious issues, and even if you could it would make it slow as heck. Usually the program you are trying to install has some sort of install.ini file with setting,like minimum ram, windows os, defautl directories etc- try to search for that.

Does any know fix/cause of USB drives that lose connection
Windows is just an operating system, the BIOS is the layer that allows any OS like, linux, bsd, windows to communicate with the hardware layer. So yes. Setting the BIOS properly will most likely solve the hardware related issues.

try turning off pwoer saving in BIOS/ or USB realted power settings or compatibilit, each BIOS has different names so you will need to consult your manual what each feature does..

How does one troubleshoot Windows hanging copying large files from external HDDs?
If possible- do you have another USB3.0 Drive/Enclose that is a different make? Does it also do that. I have only seen this slowdown on older machines that have a IDE/SATA driver mismatch.. otherwise this is quite weird problem.

With that kind of spec of machine, there should be NO problem like freezing up. yea it is fast.. but that machine should handle 10times that amount.. Either you have a driver mismatch or hardware fault.. cant really say.(because it seems to be running at full spec.. so its difficult to find the problem)

What kind of hard drive is inside the computer? SATA or IDE? Did it take 1 minute to copy 8GB file?

Changing the FROM email address in Outlook 2007 AD HOC i.e. spoofing the FROM address
"Spoofing" is done at server level, not client level. So you will either need a proxy SMTP server/script to do this. Outlook is dumb and for general public, imagine each john doe having the ability to "spoof" emails.. bladdy nightmare.. Whatever it is you want to do it should be done via some SMTP (postfix/sendmail) or winblows based email senders... Soz..
