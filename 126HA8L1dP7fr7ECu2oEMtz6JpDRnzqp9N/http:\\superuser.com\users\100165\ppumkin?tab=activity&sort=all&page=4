How to recover data from damaged hard drive?
@Iserni - You are wrong. Two disks cannot be absolutely identical- How can 2 things be the same 1 thing! Each PCB builds its own "area mapping" on the pcb eprom - even the same PCB if it factory reset will rebuild the "area mapping" - completely different than first time. It is dynamic and nothing to do with PCB- It is the firmware. Then these dynamic areas are stored in the service area (a hidden part of the hard drive to store data for the PCB) - PCB Swap used to work 100% on drives smaller than 80GB. To swap PCB today you need to swap eprom too!(not easy)

How to recover data from damaged hard drive?
PS -1 million for adviaizng to open the hard drive! And - 1 million for suggestion to move the platters. No human in the world can realign the platters if moved separately. Not even a machine can do it. Moving platters - professionals can do it but it costs about 50,000USD because its more complicated than brain surgery.

How to recover data from damaged hard drive?
Just trying to replace the PCB without actually knowing if it is the PCB is very very very bad! Sometimes putting an identical PCB will wipe the Service Area data and all the data will be lost . forever and ever. You should play the lottery cause you are one lucky sun of a gun that you had luck with that. Anyway. Bad advice! -1

Never ever run chkdsk on a drive that has symptoms of HDD crash. chkdsk cannot repair physical repair. Most modern file system cope very well with bad sectors and chkdsk mostly tries to fix errors relating to OS rather than HDD. SO its useless here.

How to get customizable right click menu for Windows 7 desktop?
I like your idea. But I don't think its possible :( I have never seen it done on un-hacked Windows. The same boring square box for the last 16 years of my life...

watch techsnap show 101 and fast forward to user feedback near the end. They explain how firewalls are useless in this case and how pfsense is the answer.

What is the best way to restrict network access for one machine on a home LAN?
The only way is if a user on Machine C accesses the 2nd router and changes all the settings so he is on the same IP range as the 1st router. But neither side can scan other ranges without proper hacking or changing settings in the routers. Take a look at pfsense. It might seem daunting and complciated. But it gives you SOOOO much flexibilty in how you want to exactly setup networks. Plus there are so many security things you can do to help prevent malicious activity. It is a router and firewall tightly combined to give you maximum security and configuration.

Using the 2 routers - the second one needs to be one like a internet router. You the cable into 2nd router WAN port and into 1st router LAN. Because they are on different IP's neither network will be able to cross talk. There is no special configuration! 1st router will see 2nd router as a "PC" but all the PC's on router 1 cannot see the other network because you have to set it up to use another IP address. It is a bit strange but it does work! I have done it many times- especially when there are 2 or more Internet connection.

Look- End of the day firewalls is not the correct answer for long term and security reliability. Like I said already several times the OP will need another device- Did I not? I did, I did... face palm

I withdraw my -1 just because I misread the answer. Really @11k rep you would have thought you knew how to format an answer nicely. You deserve -1 just for that.

Is that not what I said in my answer? You need another router/swithc that will translate network traffic to the gateway! Besides I re read this terribly unformatted and cluttered answer and that is the same thing Rich is saying. What are you even on about cpast? Firewalls IS NOT THE WAY TO GO.
