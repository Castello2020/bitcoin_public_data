How to make Outlook show the unread count of a folder, including its sub-folders?
Ahh really nice solution :) +1 and +beer! Even today using Outlook 2010 this still is the only way to do it.

How the switch decides destination is also on the same interface similar to that of source?
Well I realised that diagram is using HUB's - HUB's suck and I dont really remember how they work. Switches will just "flood" as you say

It doesn't know. It just pushes the packets to the whole range for everybody to know.

Free CCTV software using webcam running on Windows
It is not that difficult to start recording BEFORE movement actually happens. Not its not magic and not psychic! It called time shifting and you use it on your smart TV or set top box everyday. Basically the stream is buffered with 5, 10 30 seconds and if you want to save a recording seconds before it happens this is possible with time shifting - The simplest things are the most difficult to imagine :)

Can I shrink an NTFS partition running Windows 7 from the 'left' / 'start' side?
You can. It reboots the PC and does it in offline mode :) Then boots back when its done. Its the freakiest thing to see...

It is capable of doing it. And you are confusing Operating Systems with applications. Neither Linux nor Windows can do anything but host application like GParted or EaseUS. In this case EaseUS is much better because it solves all the boot sector problems that GParted can't.

PCIe SSD as main (boot) hard drive on AsRock X97 Extreme M4
I am gonna buy an OCZ Vertex 450 soon for gaming - Load times are blasted away. No prob. Sorry for rough start.

You will notice a massive difference on SSD SATA and then PCIe will blow you away. The largest project we have to compile is Kentico. Over an hour... I wonder how much faster that would be on a setup like yours (but we don't need to compile every day cause it uses uncompiled source - runtime compiling for pages)

Yea- We don't really know what he needs it for. A RAM Drive is great for large Photoshop Files.. compiling software in .NET is mostly read with CPU and some small out files (unless its a gigantic project)

It is realistic but as you already know it is difficult in some cases. Keep It Simple - ANd use a good SATA Drive as your OS and if you r REALLY need that 1GB/s then use a PCIe drive as a scratch drive or application container.

Umm. You can view the source of the video tag, copy it and paste it into VLC? But you can't speed something up if you have not go the data to do it. Weird question? (Ale co ty chcesz zrobic tak naprwade?)

What are you doing that get the HDD to 100% usage? I mean you said the HDD is a bottleneck. During what activity is this happening?

How- What can you be possibly doing that you are getting bottleneck problems with a modern hard drive?

So what is the question? We cant give you advice on hardware shopping here! And seconds your HDD should not be doing 100% you have some serious issues there. Ask a proper localised question not some essay.

Why use LINUX to do Windows operations. It really annoys me when people suggest to use Linux software to Windows users. You don't see me going on Linux forums and telling a-patch-me users to use IIS 8. You get a -1
