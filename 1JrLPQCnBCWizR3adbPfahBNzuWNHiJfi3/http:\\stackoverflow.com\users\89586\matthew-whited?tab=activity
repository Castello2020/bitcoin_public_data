I mainly work as a .Net developer these days but I enjoy pretty much any code. And I really like playing with bits down at the hardware level :)

Connect node.js and signalr via sockets
the signalr protocol is pretty light weight. probably lighter than the hassle of yet another layer with configuration, support and all the related fun.

Why this method is slow?
You might want to check with and without using unsafe. I have seen instances where unsafe causes code to run slower. The bigger speed boost is probably the fact you are using "numBytes" instead of calling ".Length" on every loop.

Simulating Polymorphic/Generic Enumerations - C#
If we are being overly technical they don't define a constructor at all. Yes you could call "new" on an enum but it would be uninitialized and would be better to explicitly choose the value you want from your enumeration.
