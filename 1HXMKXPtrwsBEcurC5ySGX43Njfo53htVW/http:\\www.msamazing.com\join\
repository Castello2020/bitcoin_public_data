    <strong>Use of IP Addresses</strong><br>
    An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. MsAmazing.com may collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to audit the use of our site. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.

    <br>

You will notify MsAmazing.com of any unauthorized use or other breaches in security of your Account immediately after you learn of the same.<br>
    Security of Stored Data and Files<br>
    MsAmazing.com will endeavor to restrict access to the files you store or retrieve from your Account to persons accessing such files through use of your Account or Password. However, no password-protected system of data storage and retrieval can be made entirely impenetrable. Accordingly, you hereby acknowledge that it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to access, view, copy, modify and distribute the files you store in your Account. For maximum privacy and security, we recommend that you not share your password with anyone.<br>
    <br>
	<strong>Multiple Accounts</strong><br>

MsAmazing.com may comply with these subpoenas or court orders with or without notice to the subscriber. MsAmazing.com reserves the right to refuse, remove or disable access to any data or files stored on MsAmazing.com's servers with immediate effect that MsAmazing.com learns may be illegal, may violate the terms of paragraph 2 above, may violate the rights of any third party or otherwise may be reasonably objectionable.<br>
