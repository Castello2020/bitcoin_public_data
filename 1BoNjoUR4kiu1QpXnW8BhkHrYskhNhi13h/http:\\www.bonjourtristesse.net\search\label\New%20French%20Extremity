IMDB
Amazon
Directorial team, Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury's "Inside" is the pinnacle of the New French Extremity. It starts off slow and rapidly escalates into one of the most tense, gory, disgusting, and shocking films you will ever see. Béatrice Dalle (Trouble Every Day, Le temps du loup), steals the show here as "The Woman", an absolutely terrifying, menacing, relentless, and psychotic villain. Happy Halloween! Share:
