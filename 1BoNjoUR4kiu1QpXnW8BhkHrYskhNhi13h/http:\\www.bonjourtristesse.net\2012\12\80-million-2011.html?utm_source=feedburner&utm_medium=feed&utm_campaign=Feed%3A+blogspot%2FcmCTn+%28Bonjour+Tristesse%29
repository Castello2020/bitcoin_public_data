80 Million (2011)
80 Million • 80 Milionów (2011) Genre: Drama
Director: Waldemar Krzystek
Starring: Filip Bobek, Marcin Bosak, Wojciech Solarz, Piotr Glowacki, Sonia Bohosiewicz
Language: Polish
Duration: 102 min.
Rating: 6.6 Summary:
1981 Poland, in the days before martial law was imposed, Solidarity activists stage a daring plan to withdraw 80 million and squirrel it away under the watchful eyes of the security services.
80 Million is a film directed by Waldemar Krzystek, co-written with Krzysztof Konopka, and based on real events that took place during December 1981. It premiered internationally in competition at the 2012 (34th) Moscow International Film Festival, and it is Poland's official entry to the 85th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.
This one's a cross between a political thriller and a heist film, that tells of an interesting event in the fight against Communism in Poland by the Solidarity union. A small group of activists get information that martial law will soon be imposed, allowing the government to freeze everyone's money, so they make a plan to withdraw all of the union's cash, 80 million zlotys (about $25M), not an easy task to get away with while under heavy surveillance by the government security services.
The film is presented in a rather generic political/spy movie style, filled mostly with stock characters, predictable developments, and a simplification of the history and politics in exchange for entertainment and universal appeal. This however, actually makes for a bit of a refreshing watch, as it's not at all like the grim and miserable depictions of the era that we are used to seeing from this part of the world.
Seen from that perspective, it is an enjoyable picture, with decent period detail, a good bit of tension and intrigue, the requisite sex and violence, and even a touch of comedy. The problem is, it does take a while for the plot to actually start moving; and despite what the trailer tries to sell, the overall production values are not impressive enough for it to attract a worldwide audience. Not bad, but it's safe to say, Poland will not be repeating last year's success of a nomination.

A pity as it sounded good.

I'd pass this one up, even. I mean the soundtrack was a huge turnoff for me, at least in that trailer.. and it looks a bit generic and.. meh?
