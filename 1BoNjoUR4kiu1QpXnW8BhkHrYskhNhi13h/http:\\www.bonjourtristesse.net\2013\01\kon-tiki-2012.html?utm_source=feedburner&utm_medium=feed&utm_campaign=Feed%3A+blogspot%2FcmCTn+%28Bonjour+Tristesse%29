Kon-Tiki (2012)
Kon-Tiki (2012)
Genre: Adventure
Director: Joachim Rønning, Espen Sandberg
Starring: Pål Sverre Valheim Hagen, Anders Baasmo Christiansen, Odd-Magnus Williamson, Agnes Kittelsen
Language: Norwegian, English
Duration: 118 min.
Rating: 6.3 Summary:
The legendary explorer Thor Heyerdal's epic 4,300 miles crossing of the Pacific on a balsa wood raft in 1947.
Kon-Tiki is a film by the Norwegian directing duo Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg. It is a dramatization based on the true story of Thor Heyerdahl, a Norwegian explorer who in 1947, crossed the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Polynesia on a balsa wood raft. It is Norway's official submission to the 85th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and is on the nine film shortlist. It has also been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards.
This is no doubt a fascinating tale about an even more fascinating individual (his self made documentary filmed during the original expedition, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1951); and directors Rønning and Sandberg have managed to create an entertaining effects filled adventure out of the true story.
However, just like the majority of these types of films, the result feels too much like a simplified cartoon version of the events. Even kicking things off with a cliched traumatic childhood flashback prologue.
Along the way, Heyerdahl (Pål Sverre Valheim Hagen) and crew, encounter a string of deadly obstacles and dangers in the form of sharks and storms. All of which are visually impressive and skillfully executed sequences that are exciting in the moment, but overall offer nothing that a modern viewer hasn't seen many times before. The characterizations are also very flimsy. Aside from Watzinger (Anders Baasmo Christiansen), the divorced engineer, and Thor's wife Liv (Agnes Kittelsen who starred in last year's Happy Happy), the rest of the cast and crew members are never developed beyond a name and a face.
In the lead role, Hagen never truly impresses either. He's likeable and seems to have mastered the art of the dead stare, but lacks the fiery intensity and undeniable charisma of someone who could convince you to drop everything and sail across the ocean with. Having said all that, it's not a terrible film. Just a very conventional average one that will soon be forgotten, and really has no place in awards discussions.

I guess it might be easy to come across now, but I won't be looking for it otherwise.

I'm sad to hear this wasn't as good that I was hopeing for. I've read a couple of books by Heyerdahl about his expeditions and they've been very good reads.

Damn I was just checking out the trailers for this and they looked very cool. Sad to hear this does not rise to the level of greatness. :-(

I just expected a little more depth and creativity, considering some of the recent stuff coming from Norway. This one is just too conventional and I don't know, easily digestible. It does make me want to track down the original 1951 documentary though, Heyerdahl seems like a really fascinating figure.

It seems to be getting lots of love from the awards people, so who knows, you might enjoy it more than I.
