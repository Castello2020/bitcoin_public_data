<p>I'm an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_period">early modern</a> historian, <a href="https://github.com/sbp">software developer</a>, and chiffchaff detector.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:As_of">As of</a> 2014, I'm working on improving computing at every level, especially through learning the lessons of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine">lisp machines</a>.

<p>I'm a resident of the <em>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</em>, though that might change with the 2014 Scottish Independence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014">referendum</a>. If it does, then who knows what I'll be a resident of.

<p>On the web, I'm known either for being friends with anti-securocracy people, or for the abandoned shovelware <a href="http://inamidst.com/phenny/">irc bot</a> that I'm still inordinately fond of. I'm trying to replace that with a new python3 bot.

<p>Sometimes I take photographs of the moon. Here is one that I took in 2010 of the craters Clavius and Tycho, through my 6" Newtonian reflector:

<p>I was in the first round of YC startups, 2005, with Aaron Swartz and Simon Carstensen. I will be taking care of Aaron's sites and data, so email me with queries about that. Please note that I cannot currently perform administrative actions, but I can give give advice and answer questions.

<p>I'm in love with Tabitha St Germain, but don't tell her that.
