Winklevii say they own one percent of all Bitcoins
Twins who got wealthy suing Facebook now own $11 million of virtual currency.

Cameron Winklevoss at 2008 Beijing Olympics.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are most famous for their courtroom clash with Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg. That lawsuit ultimately earned the twins $20 million, as well as Facebook stock that was worth $45 million at the time (but now may be worth $200 million). Their high-stakes tech litigation was immortalized in the movie The Social Network, in which the Zuckerberg character refers to the twins as the "Winklevii."
Today, the Winklevoss twins disclosed what they're doing with part of their fortunes—investing in Bitcoin. In fact, they just disclosed to The New York Times that they own about $11 million worth of Bitcoin. That puts their holdings at about one percent of the world supply, since there is an estimated $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin currently in circulation. The codes for the Winklevoss' Bitcoins are stored on flash drives, which they keep in safe deposit boxes in three different cities.
“We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error,” Tyler Winklevoss said.
It's not their only project. Through their company Winklevoss Capital, they've also invested in a shopping site called Hukkster and SumZero, "an online community for professional money managers."
The virtual currency has been incredibly volatile lately, but it's clear anyone who bought in early, like the Winklevosses did, has made a pretty penny at this point. In February it hit an all-time high of $33; by last week it had tripled in value from that to more $100. Then it soared to $260 before crashing down, losing more than half its value in six hours.
The Winklevosses expressed confidence that their bet is a good one. They bought in when Bitcoins cost less than $10 each, so it's probably one of their most high-margin investments. They believe there are at least a few other "early adopters" who have holdings as large as theirs, but it's hard to know for sure.
“People really don’t want to take it seriously," said Cameron Winklevoss. "At some point that narrative will shift to ‘virtual currencies are here to stay.’ We’re in the early days.”
The Winklevosses were involved in years of appeals after their Facebook settlement, saying they were cheated and didn't get enough money. They accused their lawyers of malpractice, then hired new lawyers to spark a long array of appeals, all of which failed. They finally gave up their legal fight in 2011.

It is a race as to which will drop faster: Facebook stock or bitcoins.

Zuckerberg: "LOL, that's cute." He immediately buys all bitcoins at devalued rate, deletes them from existence.

$11 million on Tuesday? Or yesterday after the crash? Or today after another crash?Why don't they just say how many bitcoins they have? Even they are converting the BTC to USD and then reporting those numbers, because they know one of these things is valuable and the other is just numbers.

"free from human error" does not pass the laugh test. Bitcoins may be free from certain kinds of human error, but their history has shown that there's still plenty of human error to go around.

The bubble that burst, at this point, technically only started 3 weeks ago.

These suckers are asking to be defrauded. Bitcoins is a manipulated market where both prices and activity are artificially inflated through collusion. If the twins try to liquidate they will quickly learn the true value of their holdings. I wonder whether some of the shady online poker guys are behind bitcoins.

Until then, it's just bits on a hard drive.

and when did everyone suddenly start believeing zuckerbergs account of f..kbooks origins ?i always tended to believe the twins, out of a trio of mealy mouthed lying b..tards who may or may not had the dull idea and or wrote the code.the legal game/case always looked as dodgy as so many usa cases do, about as straight as a $9 note.like all assets, bitcoin are only worth what you can get when you NEED to sell them in a hurry, look at the gold exchange rate that refugees get when trying to buy access to safer areas.how much would b gates etc get if they HAD to cash in their book worth into hard cash in a week, they would probably get 20% of book value, as someone else noted, the hunt brothers had a bit of a problem before.

Quote:Still, you have to love the fact that there are people using the "crash" to scoff, while in reality it means that people only made 1000% on their money in 3 months instead of 2000%. So it is exactly what the scoffers said it is, a commodity with no intrinsic value and not a currency.Quote: I wouldn't be calling them idiots at this point just yet. The only way for those people to have made money off of bitcoin is to have sold it to someone else for more actual currency than they bought it for. So yes at any given point there are more idiots in the BTC market than smart people. It's a pyramid scheme, as has been pointed out from the get-go.

Sorry, off topic, but pet peeve:The plural 'Winklevii' makes no sense. I'm assuming that the Zuckerberg character was jokingly using the Roman plural 'Winklevi', as if their name was 'Winklevus', rather than 'Winklevoss'. It sounds almost the same, so it's a somewhat cute joke. Using 'Winklevii' would only make sense if their name was 'Winklevioss', which could be pronounced as 'Winklevius', which would have a Roman plural -ii. Ok, pet peeve silenced and kicked into a corner. Carry on.

When exchanges regularly shut down, deflation is a feature rather than a bug, and small groups control a large volume of said currency and treat it as an investment which means volatility and liquidity will only get worse, you're not talking about a reasonable currency. You're talking about a currency backed by an economy in danger of imminent collapse.

So this is what Bitcoins are for: a form of gambling for the idle rich that, unlike stock markets and real currency trading, does not result in the destruction of real, productive industries. Great idea! Phase two will surely be to convince the owners of large Bitcoin hordes to trade them in for places on a "B" ark leaving the solar system.
