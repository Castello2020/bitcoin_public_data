				<description>42coin comes with 8 digits after the dot.
To me it actually 4.2 billion coins out there for the dumbasses to waste their electricity and hardwares in it. Another sucker crypto game.</description>

				<description>omg why do people not understand this stuff by now....it's like trading gift cards..

Say I have a $100 gift card to store A; I will sell it for $90 cash or trade it for a $120 gift card to a less desirable store to me (Store B); or I'll even take a $50 gift card at a very desirable store I really want to buy something from...now other people will have different stores they value so the price of what I can sell it for is always moving depending on what people will pay for it. But my value of a $100 gift card at store A is still $100</description>

				<description>The whole world runs and consists of bubble's and cryptocurrency isn't anymore of a bubble then real currency is.
They put on the presses the people put on their computers. At least with a decent cryptocoin we don't get fucked over by our own governments.</description>

				<description>I did some research on this coin and it really stands out over all the other coins that are currently created.
Sure more will come with clones of this design again but as anyone knows first to market wins.
A few points that make it a very interesting coin to buy and hold it a while.

- In about 1.5 years al 42 coins will be mined.

- It's a people's coin more than a corporate coin like bitcoin. Bitcoin is being mined almost soley by big cooperations (Chinese) with milions invested in ASIC mining equipment.

- This coin is scrypt instead of SHA256 like bitcoin is. Scrypt designed coins can be mined by everyone that has a decent videocard in his computer. Because so many people will mine this there's no big corps fucking with the price selling coins cheap, cause panic and buy back cheaper.

- There are already webshops trying to get this coin accepted as payment. This is insanely fast.

- Due to the construction of this coin it's value will fluctuate a bit at first but as more coins are mined it will start going higher and higher. It could be a very wise choise to buy for a few bucks and sit this one out. People who missed the bitcointrain could be looking at a second chance here.

- It's speculation but i think one 42 coin could be worth over 50.000 BTC before half of the 42's is mined.</description>

				<description>I'm sorry BI, but this is a stupid post. 42Coin is another coin that doesn't actually change anything meaningful from Bitcoin. Bitcoin already adjusts difficulty depending on how many active miners there are. The only difference is how many there are, which is an arbitrary number. I could make a coin called 1Coin, and only one will ever be mined, and 1Coin would be worth millions, if I found anyone to take some. Just because you lower the number of *coins, doesn't mean that its instantly super cool for being &quot;pricey&quot;. Price isn't what matters. Bitcoin could be worth $0.05 and still be super useful. Its the users and feature set of a network that makes it &quot;valuable&quot;.</description>

				<description>It's like a dream within a dream! Come one, we can go one more tier here. 1 Inceptcoin is worth 1000 - 42coins... This is just madness.</description>

				<description>I'm not sure where this coin is going, but Bitcoin's worth has proven its worth over and over to the haters.

If you want some 42coin. The best way would be to get Bitcoin and trade on an exchange. Here is a way to get Bitcoin with little investment.

				<description>It's going to have problems with denominations if it ever becomes popular. The amount of zeros for a small transaction would be insane. People will need to expand their client just to see the .0000.......001 coin.
