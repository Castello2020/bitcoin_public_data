				<description>One paragraph? okay. Go to Bitaddress.org. Click on &quot;Paper Wallet&quot;. Print them. Go to your Bitcoin wallet. Send your coins to the address on the paper wallet. 

Oh damn ... i didn't even need a paragraph. See ... all you have to do is actually learn something about a topic, before you speak on it. Then amazing things happen!

As for the second item, you would keep a small spendable amount on your phone, and simply .. uhhh ... pay for your sammich at the deli. Assuming they accept bitcoin. Takes about a split second, and costs zero. Oh, and the deli owner loves you because he didn't have to pay a 3% visa transaction fee. 

Next question?</description>

				<description>Why are you still whining about Bitcoin? Are you unable to see that *EVERY*SINGLE*PREDICTION* you've made has been 1,000% dead wrong so far? How long can one guy live in denial before he wakes up and realizes whats happening around him? You're a funny funny little man Alpha. Keep trying ... its pure entertainment the nonsense that comes out of your mouth about Bitcoin. You've been at it since June 2013 and been dead wrong every single time.</description>

				<description>@alpha directed : Glad to see you're still commenting on Bitcoin articles. I am specifically going to keep looking for you when every ignorant comment you've made in the past, ends up being systematically proven wrong, one by one. Please don't disappear. Or at least keep an eye on the comments section where I'll be specifically asking where you are, and why you're so quiet. As a side note, I highly recommend you get some Bitcoin before it hits $10,000 this year.</description>

				<description>There are already banks/insurers taking out insurance policies on Bitcoin in the event that theft does occur. Like with EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD, Bitcoins can be stolen electronically. That being said if you have your cash under your bed it cannot be stolen electronically(but in person yes). If you have multiple copies of your Bitcoin wallet encrypted in 256 SHA in a USB under your bed that cannot be stolen electronically, but can be in person(you won't be cracking it for 100 years for one wallet, or possibly ever).

Or you can do a simple Google search. Allow me to create a link for you to show you how much of an effing idiot you are that I even have to do this. Let me Google that for you is about people like yourself who are too fucking lazy to search.

				<description>Well you're right, without power and a known trading price it would be difficult to tell what a Bitcoin was worth.. but that would probably be the least of your worries because the stock market wouldn't work, your bank account wouldn't work, and the whole world would be melting down.... 

As far as how to turn bitcoin into paper wallets, it's quite easy... I'm pretty sure coinbase.com lets you just print your wallet off onto a piece of paper. You need access to the internet (a cellphone will do) to verify how much money is on the wallet). Here is a step-by-step: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/wallet/paper-tutorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; &gt;https://blockchain.info/wallet/paper-tutorial&lt;/a&gt;</description>

				<description>As of now 1 bitcoin equals 855 usd
Now i get the argument that the fed is devaluing the dollar. 
Bitcoin is not about getting rich, its about an alternative currency.
But, this seems like the same casino Wall Street is running.</description>

				<description>So a bunch of World Of Warcraft geeks get together and create a algorithm that creates money with no transparency. I'm suppose to trust this. Sounds exactly likes whats going with currency your trying to avoid.</description>

				<description>Bitcoin is here to stay and Dogecoin is growing a lot too. Virtual currency is the future of borderless global transactions. Government currencies are in competitive devaluation mode and very cumbersome to use cross borders. Not a good recipe for acceptance and that is precisely what give a currency it's value.

				<description>Just to clarify, Bitcoin can be stored in a safe. I have several hundred Bitcoin stored on paper wallets and then put in safety deposit boxes spread amongst 3 different banks (I'm paranoid about security). So yes, Bitcoin can and often does go in a safe.</description>
