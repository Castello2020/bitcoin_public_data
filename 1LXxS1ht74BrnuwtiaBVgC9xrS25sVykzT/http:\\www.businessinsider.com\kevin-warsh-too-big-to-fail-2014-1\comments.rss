				<description>Do prostitutes generally have nice things to say about their former and potentially future pimps? Not certain, but at least you can understand how someone down on their luck turns to the sex trade. When someone continues to support and promote a predatory and parasitic industry out of greed it is both inexcusable and indefensible.</description>

				<description>Eventually, to protect the economy, these banks will have to be broken up to a size that doesn't threaten the whole system if an individual one fails. Putting off the inevitable will only make it more painful, but it WILL happen.</description>

				<description>Let them fail as they are now and see the economy freeze up and then go really badly.
So no it's not an illusion. The big banks know they hold the economy in their hands and will use that power to get all they want and more. 
That is what Too Big To Fail means.</description>

				<description>Most *new money* is created through the private banking system as required and continuously. The current Big Banks are the central asset in the system as the Federal Reserve simply augments private money creation. As such the big money center banks will NOT be broken up in any time scale relevant to you. You will be dust for many years before the important banks are ever broken up.
One may replace another at some point likely by takeover ordered by regulatory authorities but the system itself will continue.</description>

				<description>The Roman Empire wasn't too big to fail. The Soviet Union wasn't too big to fail. Enron wasn't too big to fail. WorldCom wasn't too big to fail.

&quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; is an illusion which only benefits the banks in question. They know as long as everybody believes they are TBTF, then they will be... and they can continue making bad decisions, and giving themselves fat bonus checks at taypayer expense forever. Who's going to complain? Not their shareholders. Not their customers. This will go on for as long as the voting and investing public puts up with it.</description>

				<description>Unfortunately the republic has been destroyed. We were so concerned about communism that we failed to see capitalism take over our country. Now we have mini kingdoms or monarchy's... if you will.</description>

				<description>Too Big To Fail means Too Big To Exist. They need to be broken up. 
The world cannot have socialism for the ultra rich and social Darwinism for the rest.</description>
