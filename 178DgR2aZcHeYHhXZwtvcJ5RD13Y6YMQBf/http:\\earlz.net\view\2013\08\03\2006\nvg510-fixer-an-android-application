<h2><a href="/view/2013/08/03/2006/nvg510-fixer-an-android-application">NVG510 Fixer -- An Android Application</a></h2>
<div><p><strong>App was pulled from Google Play</strong>. The app violated Google's ToS out right, so there's nothing I can really do to appeal it and get it listed again. So, I'm making it free for everyone to download and side-load on their android device. </p>

<p>Download it here: <a href="http://earlz.net/static/com.earlz.nvg510fixer.v2.2.apk">http://earlz.net/static/com.earlz.nvg510fixer.v2.2.apk</a>  Eventually I intend to release the source code under an open source license, but I must first clean it up some. </p>

<p>I was selling it for $3 on Google Play, so if this app helps you, consider donating. My paypal address is earlz -at- earlz dot net. My Bitcoin address is <code>178DgR2aZcHeYHhXZwtvcJ5RD13Y6YMQBf</code>, or my Dogecoin address is <code>DLY7Vh8oDYLRxQLFAg2PruA15zFMRqoXGu</code>. </p>

<p>I get a lot of people coming to this site every day for fixing problems with the AT&amp;T U-Verse NVG510 modem. I found <a href="http://earlz.net/view/2012/06/07/0026/rooting-the-nvg510-from-the-webui">the information</a> to fix the common problems and root it. However, the procedure for fixing this is a bit technical. So, I made the Android application <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.earlz.nvg510fixer">NVG510 Fixer</a>. An Android application makes it a lot easier for you, but I also get to make a tiny bit of money along the way (have I mentioned there is a baby on the way!?) </p>

<p>First off, make sure the IP address of your modem is correct. If you don't know what an "IP Address" is, don't worry about it. This should only be different if you explicitly set it differently (which there is no reason to do)</p>

<p>Second, you'll need to enter in the password to the device. This should be written on a sticker on the modem labeled "Device Access Code". It should be a 10 digit number. Type that in. </p>

<h2>What these buttons do</h2>

<p>Now, you have a few different options: </p>

<ol>
<li>Enable Telnet -- If you know what this is, you may be interested in it (It'll be on port 23)</li>
<li>Disable Telnet -- Everything here will enable telnet. It shouldn't be terribly dangerous to turn on since it's password protected, but if you're paranoid about security, you can disable it afterwards</li>
<li>Fix Redirect -- This is the infamous <strong>"Potential Connection Issue"</strong> or <code>/cgi-bin/redirect.ha</code> problem that hijacks other websites and is extremely annoying. Click this button and you'll never see that page again(note: you may have to restart your computer/browser if you are currently seeing it) </li>
<li>Enable UPnP -- If you're a gamer, this option is useful to you. This enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">Universal Plug And Play</a>, which is a long way of saying that you can have an Open NAT type without having to do anything else</li>
<li>Reboot -- Finally, you can restart the modem remotely if you're feeling lazy</li>
</ol>

<h2>Potential Problems</h2>

<p>There are a few different issues that could happen with this. I'll try to point you in the right direction</p>

<ul>
<li>I keep getting  "login appears to have been unsuccessful" -- Make sure you're using the <strong>"device access code"</strong>, not the "wireless network key". Also, make sure that when you go to <a href="http://192.168.1.254">http://192.168.1.254</a> in your browser that you get the AT&amp;T modem page. </li>
<li>I get "no route to host" -- Make sure your devices's wifi is connected to your NVG510 access point</li>
<li>I get "operation timed out" -- You might have to try pushing that button once more</li>
<li>I get "connection refused" -- sometimes it takes a few seconds to enable telnet(which every other button relies on). Wait a few seconds and try again</li>
<li>Your application force closes! -- That's not good :( Send me an email at earlz -at- (this website name) or post below in the comments and I'll try and fix it</li>
</ul>

<h2>After Factory Reset</h2>

<p>If you (or AT&amp;T) does a factory reset of your modem, you will have to do this again. However, if your modem loses power and resets, you shouldn't have to run this again</p>

<h2>It didn't work!</h2>

<p>If you were seeing the "potential connection issue" page, and afterwards your browser gives an error like "server timed out" or "host not reachable", then you may actually not have internet. In that case, call AT&amp;T and hope for the best :) This application will not solve issues with your phone line! </p>

<p>If it didn't do what you wanted, request a refund!</p>

<h2>Where is a free version?</h2>

<p>I know it's a bit tacky to charge for such a simple application, but I think it's justified in this case. I've spent plenty of time getting to know the NVG510 and helping other people with it, as well as preparing all of the information for publication here. So, I think it's fair. If you don't like it, I will always provide the slightly more technical version for free. See <a href="http://earlz.net/view/2012/06/07/0026/rooting-the-nvg510-from-the-webui">this blog post</a> for details on how to do that. </p>

<h2>What's next</h2>

<p>I'm not sure. I want to add DNS server fixing, but I don't think I'll be able to fit it in. I'm using <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin Android</a> Starter Edition. As such, I have limitations on how complex and big I can make my application. If you want to donate $300 for me to obtain a full license, I'd love you forever :)</p>

<p><a id="factoryreset"></a></p>

<h2>Factory Reset</h2>

<p>This will completely reset your modem as if AT&amp;T just shipped it to you. It will undo all configuration settings</p>

<p><a id="bridgemode"></a></p>

<h2>Bridge Mode</h2>

					<pre>Hi
I tried both manual (according to a Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_O6rus8Yqw&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) and your app. I didn&#39;t solve the redirect problem. Although I haven&#39;t cleared my cache. Do you think it could be related that? My email is flyerwolf@gmail.com   </pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator.

					<pre>Hi!  I just purchased your fixer app.  When I use your app to put the NVG510 into &quot;true&quot; bridge mode...is it really bridge mode?  Now its just a modem?  I&#39;ve got to hang a Sonicwall onto an NVG510 tomorrow.  In the past I&#39;ve had such terrible experiences with this router and AT&amp;T...if its a true bridge mode I just might live through this experience.
Thanks.</pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator. Otherwise puts out tabs and extra linefeeds -->

					<pre>Earlz,  I do have a question I&#39;d like to ask you:  Using your NVG510 Fixer app I set the router to bridge mode and for some reason find that I want to undo the bridge mode, so I set it back, will the settings that the NVG510 had prior to entering bridge mode still be
in the router or will they be erased or scrambled?  Also, a suggestion for a new feature for your fixer app would be a save settings feature.  Thank you,  KJ</pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator. Otherwise puts out tabs and extra linefeeds -->

					<pre>@KJ Bridge mode should not affect other settings. You should be able to enable and disable it and have no side effects. However, I can&#39;t guarantee that, so always write down what settings you&#39;ve applied in case a factory reset is required</pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator.

					<pre>You might want to do a factory reset and then only do the &quot;Fix Redirect Annoyance&quot; and not do anything else. Also, the redirect annoyance (potential connection error) usually occurs when you line to AT&amp;T is fairly weak. I can&#39;t fix that with an app. I just make it so that when you connection drops out momentarily, the modem doesn&#39;t block you from using the internet before pushing some &quot;continue&quot; button. </pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator.

If you&#39;re impatient though, you can use the instructions here: http://earlz.net/view/2012/06/07/0026/rooting-the-nvg510-from-the-webui
Skip to connecting to the telnet root shell/nsh, and from there you can use this command:

					<pre>Well, we put the app on a HTC Incredible (I think that might be 2.3 or 2.4), and pointed it at an NVG that was running 9.0.6h2d30, and it fails to install the backdoor, telling us:

&quot;Enabling telnet backdoor did not seem to work.&quot;

So far as we can tell, we typed in the access code correctly, but it would be easier to tell if your app didn&#39;t treat that as a password and obscure it.

					<pre>@Baylink, possible things to ensure is that the access code is correct, and that the IP address of the modem is inputted correctly. You may also try to factory reset the modem and then run the application. I&#39;ve got reports of this problem but have yet to reproduce it on my own hardware. I think it may have something to do with DNAT-DMZ</pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator. Otherwise puts out tabs and extra linefeeds -->

					<pre>I did in fact have her reset it and try again this morning; same result, I&#39;m told.

Factory Reset from the app didn&#39;t work with the same error, so I had her long-press the reset button.  I&#39;ll go back and double check all the things, though.

It has occurred to me to wonder: there aren&#39;t any problems that could be due to the fact that *we&#39;re using the NVG&#39;s wifi* to do this, are there?  :-}</pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator. Otherwise puts out tabs and extra linefeeds -->

					<pre>Well, a *really* hard reset, and making sure the phone hadn&#39;t skipped to the neighbor&#39;s wifi, seems to have made it talk to the modem.  But the Cisco RV042 behind it, set to its known IP/gate/mask seems not to talk, nor be accessible at the Remote Management port I had her set it to.  I wonder what&#39;s next.  :-}

					<pre>Sorry; that last was me.

Well, a powercycle on all 3 devices leaves us with working-to-internet wifi on the modem again.  If I&#39;m following correctly, that suggests that the Enable Bridge didn&#39;t stick over a reboot; is that supposed to require a Save action in the app?

I can&#39;t telnet to 28 from the net, either.  Having her retry Enable Backdoor...

...and it says it&#39;s already installed.  Strange things are afoot at the Circle K...

					<pre>I might be able to help you with the iOS app.  Only catch is that I have no clue how to develop apps for iOS.  I have developed a few but used an online engine that was a simple drag and drop.  I have downloaded xamarin free version and compiled an app using their sample code and that was easy so if I had the code build I could compile it with my developer account.  I do have a mac, iPhone, and apple developer license.  And if the free version of Xamarin does not work I believe I can get a license for it.  I am sure there are a few other issues that would need to be worked out but if interested please email me.  jakumpe@justinkumpe.net</pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator.

					<pre>@Tech that&#39;s odd. If you have the Developer Options enabled on your phone, you should ensure that you are using the Dalvik runtime, not the ART runtime. The development tool I used for my app will not work when ART is enabled. It&#39;s not enabled by default though so if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, then it must be some other issue.

					<pre>Thank you for creating this! I can hardly believe what a POS RG ATT chooses to use for their vaunted &#39;UVerse&#39;. Can this app be used to enable Port Forwarding through a static, public IP to our privale LAN without having to use an additional router behind it? On our old DSL this was cake, just poked pinholes, but talking with an ATT tech he said it cannot be done with the new unit. But then he said the DHCP can&#39;t be turned off, either. For the moment, as a workaround, I am using the upstream address that the device lists as its Broadband address even after enabling the Public IP option. But the Tech told me that that IP address is dynamic so we cannot rely upon it. I know it isn&#39;t a big deal but it is the principle of them demanding I use a crippled piece of equipment. They are so arrogant.</pre> <!--workaround for a bug in my view generator. Otherwise puts out tabs and extra linefeeds -->
