Attached to: Ask Slashdot: Communication With Locked-in Syndrome Patient?
I'm truly sorry for what has happened.Many people are addressing how to communicate, but few are addressing what to communicate. At this time, your sister-in-law is tired, afraid, and a new mom. Her mental stamina is low and she is trying to heal. Making it harder, her potential to heal won't be apparent immediately, and can take several weeks or months to show.Let her spend time with the baby. If things go badly this may be her crowning achievement, and if things go well, this may be her greatest mental uplift giving her the energy to heal.Spend time listening as well as talking with her. Always give her comments to you priority over your comments to her. If her time is limited, there's much she will want to say - you have to let her get it out.Just take things day by day. There will be good days and bad days. Bad days can actually be good news - healing is tiring, and while her brain swelling goes down and she recovers she will be extra tired. As parts of her brain switch back on and fumble to find their mental feet, she will sometimes seem off-balance.Finally, given the affected area, modify your expectations of touch. Contact is important, but it should be somewhere she is connected to. If she can't move or feel her hands (which are two quite separate things) but she can move her eyelids, contact with her face might work better. Give her a say in that - she will guide you. Touch and intimacy are vital to her wellbeing.I hope she makes a full recovery. She may well not. Take what you can get, listen to her, and do the best you can as a family to work with what you now have.Congratulations on the new baby. I hope they will grow to know and enjoy their mother.

Bitcoin Inventor Satoshi Nakamoto Could Actually Be Group From Europe

from the we-are-legion dept.
An anonymous reader writes "Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto could be a group from Europe which has a strong footing in the financial sector. From the article: 'Josh Zerlan, the Chief Operating Officer of Butterfly Labs and a person familiar with the Bitcoin network, has said it is highly likely that Nakamoto could be a group of people working the financial sector. Speaking to IBTimes UK on the sidelines of a Global Bitcoin Conference in Bangalore, India, Zerlan said: "One of the prevailing theories, I think has credibility, is that it was some group of people from financial sector that created this. They released it and stepped back and let it go. So, Satoshi Nakamoto is a group of people, I think, is a reasonable possibility."'"

This is exactly what BitPay does. They calculate the BTC price of your $ item, collect the BTC, convert that immediately at a known rate to $ and put it in your account.

That report has been thoroughly debunked. It contained statistics which were wrong, made up, and even statistics that were right! Also, the statistic was calculated 30 years ago, and the number of people who understand statistics have halved since then!

Given that fracking is a permanent change to the environment that can't be undone, EVER, I'd want to see some pretty compelling evidence that it absolutely can't cause harm, EVER, before being used widely across a bunch of different geologies.

What is to stop the NSA doing a form of DoS attack on these types of services by demanding keys, and giving the services little option but to shut down?The effect of this is to remove secure competitors from the market and force users onto pre-compromised services.

I wrote a tasteful missive about the dangers of politicians of all creeds, stripes, colors. When it came time to click "submit" I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Modern politics is brought to us by the Seventh Circle of Hell. I laugh so that I do not cry.The first steps of progress in making things better would be if one party gained some competence, and the other turned off their Petty Hate Machine(tm). You, humble reader, can decide which party is which. Choose the one that makes you happiest and upmod accordingly ;)

A few bitcoin donations helped me make my mortgage payment last month, and I have a little left over. Things are picking up but it's still really tight. I had to have emergency dental surgery (blessed wisdom teeth) too... There is a point that you reach when you're desperate that you still feel the shame of begging, but the need overwhelms it.I'll just leave this here: 17S6drtGpJXer6qA5V6XhP3snasGWANBjc

Attached to: Hollywood Studios Fuming Over Indie Studio Deal With BitTorrent
As an indie filmmaker, I understand the dilemma. Granted, I'm at the low end, and don't get to work with name actors, but the problems stay the same until you have to start worrying about territories and distribution - and this is a dispute about controlling distribution.If I invest, say, $20,000 of my own money in a project, I need to be reasonably confident about making at least some of that money back or I don't get to make another movie. I don't have a patron or rich lover to fund what I do, so... I have to not make consistent losses.Facing this reality, the main way I make money is through private showings in indie theaters, selling disks direct, and then when the economic potential of the production seems tapped out, sticking it somewhere accessible so at least it is seen by *people*.That doesn't really work. I don't know what else to do. I have a couple of really fun hard sci-fi ideas I'd love to develop, but the audience is hard to reach and still get paid enough to just cover my costs... Or I can participate in the conventional distribution system and be SURE of making no money.Unless there's some rich benefactor or wealthy single lady out there *grins* my really very specialist movies have no chance of being made or seen by a wide audience.Bittorrent breaks the distribution problem, but doesn't help the money problem.
