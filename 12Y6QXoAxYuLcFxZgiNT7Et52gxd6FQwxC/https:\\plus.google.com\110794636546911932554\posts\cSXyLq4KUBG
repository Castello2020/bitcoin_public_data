Dear Nuvola Player users,
It's almost two months since development of Nuvola…Search Images Maps Play YouTube News Gmail Drive More »Send Feedback | Web History | Help | Sign inHomeHomeProfilePeoplePhotosCommunitiesEventsHangoutsPagesLocalSettingsFeedbackHelp · RegionPrivacy & Terms · Maps Terms Nuvola PlayerNuvola PlayerShared publicly - 2013-11-09 Dear Nuvola Player users,It's almost two months since development of Nuvola Player was discontinued and I've been considering resumption of the project many times since then. Unfortunately, I still cannot invest my time in Nuvola Player without any financial gain. I have to pay bills as everyone else :-(Therefore, I've decided to try the crowd-funding via Gittip once again and it's the last time I bother you with it. The funding goal is set to 59 USD/week and that would allow me to reserve reasonable long time blocks for Nuvola Player. If you are happy with Nuvola Player and appreciate all the work that has been done, please consider setting up a small recurrent donation to support resumption of further maintenance and development of Nuvola Player. If you cannot donate, please spread the word about this last crowd-funding attempt. Thank you.At the time of writing, the project is supported by six people who donate 4.60 USD/week in total (7.8 % of the goal). Will you join them? https://www.gittip.com/NuvolaPlayer/Also, I would like to change a few things in the project:- Focus on tickets with the highest score in a votebox (the votebox is in progress https://db.tt/tjcix7ao), i. e. let the community decide what features I will spend my funded time on.- Shorter release cycle (two months) to deliver new features and services faster.- Automatic installation of service update packages.- More news from the kitchen to seek feedback from community.- Improved documentation and support.- Promoting of HTML5 based streaming services.- Adoption of unmaintained services.Feel free to post any ideas and comments :-)+Jiří JanoušekP. S. Bitcoin donations from hi-tech users are also gratefully accepted: 12Y6QXoAxYuLcFxZgiNT7Et52gxd6FQwxCEdit 1: The deadline is end of November for 50 % of the goal and end of December for 100 % of the goal.﻿NuvolaPlayer receives $4.60/wk on Gittipgittip.com301419 commentsWilliam Thieme+010 Reply Do you have a flattr? That's my preferred micro donation service﻿Jiří Janoušek+121 Reply Hi +William Thieme. Yes, I have Flattr too. See http://nuvolaplayer.fenryxo.cz/contribute/donate.html﻿Richard Stews+121 Reply I've tracked other people using similar services. If you want to build up that kind of revenue. You'll need to mention your gittip, flattr, and whatever else every time you post anything. If you're not willing to do that it seems unlikely that you'll be able to hit that goal.﻿Nuvola Player+010 Reply +Richard Stews Thanks for your suggestion.﻿Oussama El-Rawas+010 Reply Is there a deadline to reach this funding goal? ﻿Nuvola Player+010 Reply +Oussama El-Rawas The deadline is end of November for 50 % of the goal and end of December for 100 % of the goal.﻿Kyle Miller+454 Reply Would it help to put an ad banner at the bottom of the player? And then, maybe offer a small fee to remove it for the "premium" version of the app. Throw in a couple of extra features for premium to spice it up. Those already gittipping get a free premium version of course.﻿Nuvola Player+121 Reply +Kyle Miller I really don't want to go this way. Nuvola Player is a free (libre) and open source software. Everybody should be allowed to use it without any restrictions. Not everyone can afford to donate money, I totally understand it and don't want to discriminate these users. However, I hope there is enough users that can afford to and are willing to support the development. Maybe I'm too naive and the project will just die. Let's see :-)Side note: Gittip donations are anonymous. The whole idea behind Gittip is that patrons tip developers/artists/etc. because they appreciate the work, not because they expect a benefit for the donation.﻿Richard Stews+232 Reply +Kyle Miller That might be a way to drive people to donations. It's kinda like what Wikipedia will occasionally do, only worse as it consumes more space than Wiki's banner ad.What would probably be best is to emulate Eclipse, Ubuntu, Adblock, Carbot Animations, or any other entity that operates on optional donations. That is to say, request donations prominently but in a polite, unobtrusive, and attractive way. Eclipse after downloading sends you to a thank you screen that features a slider that tells you about what a given donation can help them get, but offers the user nothing. Ubuntu as part of the download process has a screen to vote for features with your dollar. Adblock as part of the setup process has a donation screen with a slider that can net the generous folk various amounts of thanks, including songs of gratitude written to the donor. Carbot Animations at the end of their videos and in the description have links to their patreon account where they offer monthly hangouts on google or early preview material for upcoming videos as a reward for those who donate x or more.I'd suspect that many users don't know that Nuvola is looking for donations. Since they just use and enjoy the software, but don't actively follow it.Eclispe did a blog post about effectively asking for donations.http://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/how-to-increase-donations-to-an-open-source-project/﻿Kyle Miller+010 Reply +Nuvola Player I figured you could be open source and still serve ads. But if the current way is working, press on!﻿Nuvola Player+010 Reply +Richard Stews Thanks for you suggestions :-)I'd suspect that many users don't know that Nuvola is looking for donations. Since they just use and enjoy the software, but don't actively follow it.Good point! I could add an info bar about the current crowd-funding campaign. https://db.tt/csRl1J23 Maybe with better wording. What do you think about it?Eclispe did a blog post about effectively asking for donations.I might create a welcome screen shown at the first run of a new feature release.+Kyle Miller People hate ads. This move might be counterproductive.﻿Kyle Miller+010 Reply +Nuvola Player I hate ads too. I know how to use adblock. But for your player, I wouldn't mind seeing some ads.Here's another possible revenue generator. Be an Amazon affiliate. Show the user a Buy Now option which performs a search on Amazon with your affiliate ID. Don't know if Google Music does the same, but partner with them.Clicking Buy Now will search for either the track being listened to or the album.﻿Richard Stews+010 Reply +Nuvola Player The banner is quick and dirty, but functional. It feels like it could be worded better, unfortunately I'm drawing a blank on how to do so. Maybe parse your gittip so you can say you're at x of y goal, please donate to help keep Nuvola going.I think the welcome screen would be best if done well. Maybe offer up perks (they don't even have to be Nuvola related) for donating over x amount (monthly/weekly), like what subbable, patreon, adblock, or mozilla offer.﻿Nuvola Player+010 Reply +Richard Stews I've created three more iterations of donation bar for your feedback :-) https://db.tt/kDJ57het https://db.tt/IS1OSnaw https://db.tt/JiQULVDV﻿Oussama El-Rawas+010 Reply I like the first one of that list of three the best﻿Richard Stews+010 Reply +Nuvola Player I like the title from bar_2. I think dollar amounts are better than percents in this case. Percents are a great way to compress data, but they are a relative measure and mean less to people. Kickstarter and IndieGoGo tend to feature $ amounts, and will use % where they are short on space.I like the subtext from bar_4. It more effectively communicates that if the services Nuvola supports change that its hooks might break and Nuvola will cease to work anymore. That Nuvola will in effect die. Only it does it in fewer words well still being polite about it. The other subtext seems more to suggest that Nuvola won't get any new features and will eventually fall into obsolescence. Not so dire a message, and not so accurate either. Also the subtext from bar_4 seems more personable and less businessy. However this could just be the effect of this being close to my original suggestion, and thus my being preferential toward it.﻿Dan Caseley+121 Reply Love the new request for the donation. I was wondering how you'd draw in the users who weren't reading the site / this page.﻿Oussama El-Rawas+010 Reply I like the banner in the recent update. Looks like it might be working pretty well so far! How're you doing on other donation fronts? (bitcoin/Flatter/...)﻿Nuvola Player+010 Reply +Oussama El-Rawas I will hopefully post a summary tomorrow. I'm currently working on the votebox to finish an alpha version before today's Small Linux Party.﻿Add a comment...
