Paul --- The security community (above anyone else) should embrace and accept bitcoin. I have created a wallet for 
you, have all your donations (or sales for stickers, tshirts, etc) sent to 129xLuS3XUgmwrfxcdfAF1sy5e7wDSUsEV 

You are welcome!

Just watch out what carrier you use for shipping. Wife bought me a T-shirt from US for $20, when UPS delivered it 
they demanded Â£20 at the door in taxes and &quot;handing fees&quot; whatever they were.

You can, but I can also send you a new one (or get one from me at a conference this year).

New stickers are awesome, will be ordering them this week, hope to have them for RSA...

Hi All:

Just an administrative note, as many of you know we are re-branding! Basics go like this:

PaulDotCom Security Weekly -&gt; Paul&apos;s Security Weekly

PaulDotCom -&gt; Security Weekly

Hence, the mailing list (thanks to Rob) has been cut over, please use &quot;security weekly () mail securityweekly 
com&quot; as the new address. You&apos;ve all been migrated on the back end.

Enough of that, back to talking about security and hacking.

Carry on...

Cheers,
Paul

PS. Yes, we are working on new gear, t-shirts, patches and stickers will be showing up soon.
