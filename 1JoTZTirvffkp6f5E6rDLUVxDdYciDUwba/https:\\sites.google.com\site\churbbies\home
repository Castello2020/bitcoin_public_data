The Churbbies collectable s tuff toys could use your help, if you are willing. They're still in the process of development. But
you
can help by donating any amount you see fit...a penny, a dime, a dollar
or 2...and if you are rich and want to help in the process of turning a
dream into reality,
you can donate 1 million dollars
* Any amount will help *
The
people who donate will get to reserve a Churbbicorn. The amount you
donate will go towards the price of your Churbbicorn (shipping and
handling will be separate).
You will also be getting stickers if you
donate over 5 dollars. For everyone who donates, your name will
automatically be put on the
'honorable peoples' list, linked below:
**** LIST OF SPONSORS AND DONATORS ****
Here's my Paypal. Any donation or sponsorship will be appreciated. I will also be posting this on Kickstarter.com. My
main
plan is to have these little churbbicorns available for $14.99 ($19.99
at most. Shipping price not yet included) and available soon. Any help
will go a long way.
