Bolivia is one of the world&rsquo;s smallest contributors to the emissions 
which cause climate change. It is responsible for 0.04% of global carbon
emissions compared to the UK&rsquo;s 1.87%. Yet the effects of climate change
are already a reality in Bolivia. This has led Bolivia to play an 
increasingly forceful and prominent role in international climate change
negotiations.<br />
<br />
<strong>The impacts of climate change in Bolivia<br />
</strong><br />
There are environmental and social impacts of climate change across 
Bolivia&rsquo;s diverse regions from the Andean highlands to the Amazonian 
lowlands. It is the communities that are already in situations of 
poverty and vulnerability that are feeling the effects hardest. Five of 
the main impacts of climate change are: food insecurity; glacial retreat
and water availability; natural disasters; diseases and forest fires.<br />
<br />
Rises in near-surface temperatures have tripled since the mid 1970s. 
This has led to rapid glacial melt in the Bolivian Andes. In the 
Cordillera Real, the country&rsquo;s main mountain chain, glaciers have 
decreased by 40% of their total volume from 1975 to 2006. This has 
significant effects on water supply as well as electricity produced by 
hydropower. The Tuni Condoriri glacier, which provides the water supply 
for Bolivia&rsquo;s administrative capital La Paz and the neighbouring city of
El Alto (together accounting for around 2 million people), is expected 
to disappear partly by 2025 and fully by 2045.<br />
<br />
Climate change is affecting the frequency and severity of extreme natural events such as flooding and forest fires. In the Amazonian lowlands flooding has become
more frequent and its effects increasingly widespread. Flooding between
2006 and 2008 affected over 1 million people in a region where 32% of 
people live in poverty and are particularly vulnerable to natural 
hazards. Meanwhile forest fires - caused by drought - have also become 
more severe. In the Amazonian departments in 2010 fires affected 1.5 
million hectares of land.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Increases in temperatures have had health implications. Certain types of
mosquitoes have adapted to living at altitudes above 2,600m, leading to
increased risk of contracting diseases. Cases of malaria have been 
identified for the first time in the highland city of Oruro.<br />
<br />
In the longer-term one of the main concerns is food insecurity. Changing
temperatures, increasing irregularity of seasons and overall 
unpredictability of weather have significant implications for food 
production. Whilst the changes vary according to region and climate, 
small producers and subsistence farmers are worst affected. In 2010 
sudden drops in temperature and drought resulted in the death of 
livestock and reduction of crops which affected 21,000 families in the 
Amazon departments. In 2011 climatic instability caused Bolivian quinoa 
yields to drop 50% compared with the previous year.
</p>
<p>
Livelihood insecurity will also affect migration patterns. Migration has
always been a way of sourcing alternative incomes in the Andes where 
agricultural cycles are dictated by dry and rainy seasons. It&rsquo;s hard to 
identify climate change as the cause of migration as decisions to move 
are often complex, however, the effect of environmental instability on 
livelihoods is likely to be a strong factor. In Norte Potosi, a region 
in which 71% of the land is affected by desertification, recent research
indicates that migration is becoming more widespread. On average 15% of
communities&rsquo; populations in the area migrate each year, though in some 
communities the rate is as high as 50%. 
</p>
<p>
In the face of environmental and socio-economic adversity Bolivian 
people are responding and adapting to climate change constructively.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bolivian Climate Change Platform</strong><br />
<br />
The Bolivian Climate Change Platform is led by the Secretaries of 
Natural Resources of the five main Bolivian social movements who 
collectively represent over three million people. They receive technical
support and funding from Bolivian and international non-governmental 
organisations. The Platform was founded in 2009 as it was recognised the
country was being increasingly affected by the impacts of climate 
change. The aim of the Platform is to develop proposals to combat 
climate change through national policies in Bolivia and proposals for 
international action. <br />
<br />
At the national level, the Platform has been active in promoting the Law
of Mother Earth. The law is based on a proposal drafted with grassroots
participation from Bolivia&#39;s five main social movements. The overall 
aim of the law is to transition towards a model of living in harmony 
with nature by shifting to renewable technologies and applying 
indigenous ancestral knowledge in sustainable management of the 
environment. The Law establishes mechanisms such as a Ministry of Mother
Earth and an environmental ombudsman to protect environmental rights. <br />
<br />
The Secretaries of Natural Resources regularly participate in the UN 
climate change negotiations promoting international policies grounded in
indigenous values including the Rights of Mother Earth and based on the
conclusions of the World People&rsquo;s Conference on Climate Change (see 
below).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.cambioclimatico.org.bo/">http://www.cambioclimatico.org.bo/ </a>  <br />
<br />
<strong>The World People&rsquo;s Conference on Climate Change (WPCCC) - Bolivia, April 2010</strong><br />
<br />
Called in response to the perceived inadequacy of the 2009 UN Conference
in Copenhagen, the World People&rsquo;s Conference took place in the Bolivian
city of Cochabamba and coincided with Mother Earth Day on 22 April 
2010. The indigenous concept of <a href="news-detail.asp?id=99"><em>vivir bien</em></a>  &ndash; living well and in harmony 
with one another and nature (as opposed to living better than and in competition with others) - was prominent within the ethos and approach of the conference.
</p>
<p>
The conference brought together 35,000 people (of which 9,000 were from 
outside Bolivia) from social movements, governments, scientists and 
academics. Discussions went beyond the impacts and effects of climate 
change to identifying its structural causes.<br />
<br />
The results of the conference were presented and collated into a 
document entitled the &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Agreement&rdquo;. The Agreement calls for 
emissions to be reduced so that the world&rsquo;s average temperature is only 
increased by a maximum of 1 degree Celsius. To account for developed 
countries&rsquo; historical responsibility and the climate debt they have 
accrued it suggests that they should give 6% of their respective GDPs to
climate adaptation funds. These would be managed by national 
governments at the UN, not the World Bank. There were more detailed 
proposals for specific areas such as sustainable agriculture and 
forestry; technology transfer; supporting those who are forced to 
migrate due to climate change; the need for an International Climate and
Environmental Justice Tribunal and a Universal Declaration of Mother 
Earth&rsquo;s Rights.<br />
<br />
<strong>UN negotiations</strong><br />
<br />
The Bolivian government has taken a strongly principled position in the 
UN climate change negotiations, taking its policy line from the 
conclusions of the WPCCC. The Bolivians have pushed for a binding, 
ambitious and justice-based agreement from the discussions, often 
putting it at odds with industrialised countries which have proposed 
more pragmatic, less ambitious outcomes.<br />
<br />
The Bolivian government has been successful in gaining recognition for 
access to water as a human right at the United Nations and is also 
pushing for the approval of the Universal Declaration of Mother Earth&rsquo;s 
Rights.
