(Posted on 4/12/13 at 5:44 pm to WikiTiger)FWIW, just to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations with respect to price, according to Wikipedia, about 171,300 metric tons (~5.5 billion troy ounces, at 32150 oz/ton) of gold have been mined in human history, with about 2500 metric tons (~80.4 million troy oz., or ~1.5% of the historical total) being extracted per year in recent years. Only about 40% of gold is used for investment purposes, but assuming easy convertibility of other gold for investment purposes, the total amount of gold wealth in the world is at about $1600 x 5.5 billion = $9 trillion. So if bitcoins were to achieve the same level of currency demand as gold bullion, given a supply of 21 million, that would work out to about $400,000 per bitcoin. I don't think bitcoins will ever achieve the same level of demand that gold does (and I also think that gold price is currently somewhere between 2-3 times more expensive than where it usually is in historical terms), but it's an interesting comparison to make just to show how arbitrary the demand for a non-legal-tender currency can be. One of the problems with bitcoin value is that it will necessarily fluctuate up and down relative to the amount of government financial repression out there, and is not tied down to any intrinsic worth with redemption value or legal tender status. Thus, it's use for storing wealth will probably never be very good. It's value for clandestinely transporting wealth, however, is what makes it interesting.Back to topDoc Fenton LSU FanHouston, TXMember since Feb 200750726 postsre: Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme—the Internet’s favorite currency will collapse. (Posted on 4/12/13 at 5:57 pm to Doc Fenton)What also makes this particularly interesting to me is that it could stand as a model for how a government might control supply of a future legal tender currency. This is where we get into all the theoretical talk about the proper course of monetary policy, the "Taylor Rule," the classical monetarist policy recommendations of Milton Friedman on the proper growth rate for a currency (even though he was not in favor of having a central bank), etc. In a sense, that gets back to the point that Felix guy was making in the original post. If I were to start a country and create a monetary system from scratch, I think having some bitcoin-like system where the currency automatically increased at a rate near the economic growth level would be a good idea. I would certainly prefer this to having money created by a central bank via reserve ratio and interest rate policy decisions. Just random stuff to think about I guess...Back to topjoshnorris14 Florida FanFloridaMember since Jan 200921049 postsre: Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme—the Internet’s favorite currency will collapse.

For an individual currency itself that is just one of many within the wider economy, however, a stable supply is actually beneficial to its value. This is why American colonists loved the thaler and the Spanish pieces of eight so much. By Gresham's Law, the stable currency will tend to be more for storage and transport, while currencies with higher supply growth rates will tend to be stored only sparingly and used more frequently for common transactions, but this does not make one currency more "successful" than the other. It simply means that the currencies tend to be utilized in different ways. Solid post.

(Posted on 4/12/13 at 7:09 pm to Vols&Shaft83)I wonder when Paul Krugman is going to weigh in on bitcoins? He can hypothesize about a single bitcoin being worth $1 trillion and the Satoshis worth $10,000 and further fractional units worth lesser amounts. All the U.S. government needs to do is buy a few hundred bitcoins and hold them until they are worth $1 trillion each, and we can pay off our national debt. Meanwhile Congress can deficit spend to its heart's content.Back to topWikiTiger LSU FanMember since Sep 200740721 postsre: Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme—the Internet’s favorite currency will collapse.
