				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Company collaborates with Near Earth LLC and Cornell University</i></b></p>
<p>HOUSTON, Texas – June 19 – NASA today awarded two contracts to Deep Space Industries Inc. to accelerate the agency’s plans to partner with private industry on asteroid prospecting and harvesting.  One will analyze commercial approaches to NASA’s asteroid goals and how an industry-led asteroid economy can make crewed Mars missions safer, sooner, and less expensive.  The second will examine several small asteroid-prospecting payloads that can be launched as hitchhikers on NASA missions.</p>
<p>Participating with Deep Space on both successful proposals will be Near Earth LLC, which has been raising capital for satellite and space companies since 2002 (and over $15 billion since 1993 at prior investment banks).  It also frequently provides financial and strategic advisory services to major aerospace companies, satellite operators, private equity firms, and hedge funds.</p>
<p>Dr. Mason Peck of Cornell University, a former Chief Technologist for NASA, will collaborate with Deep Space on the small ride-along payloads contract with research into tiny “Sprites” that could be released by the dozens or hundreds during asteroid encounters to gather wide-area data.</p>
<p>“Deep Space brings commercial insight to NASA’s asteroid planning, because our business is based on supplying what commercial customers in Earth orbit need to operate, as well as serving NASA’s needs for its Moon and Mars exploration,” said CEO Daniel Faber. “The fuel, water, and metals that we will harvest and process will be sold into both markets, making available industrial quantities of material for expanding space applications and services.”</p>
<p>“The space industry is transforming with new lower-cost launch options and inexpensive small satellites, trends that Deep Space intends to exploit for its prospecting missions,” said Hoyt Davidson, Managing Member at Near Earth LLC.  “These missions should position Deep Space for the next major growth opportunity in Space &#8212; supplying space enterprises and governments with resources found and processed in space.”</p>
<p>The first study will analyze the economic fundamentals of a commercially oriented Asteroid Initiative, and document the expanded exploration resources that industry could supply to NASA if this course were followed.  NASA would receive greatly improved sampling/surveying technologies for the crew inspecting the captured asteroid at no cost to the agency.  NASA also would gain use of potentially crucial resources harvested from the asteroid without needing to pay for the research and development costs required to unlock them.</p>
<p>Deep Space has several spacecraft types under development for its asteroid mineral surveys, all based on the same core subsystems. In the second study, the company will assess each of these spacecraft for compatibility with NASA’s launch vehicle for its asteroid mission plus the initial launch of NASA’s Space Launch System.  The missions will be designed to further commercial and academic goals through innovations like Cornell’s Sprites.</p>
<p>“Each Sprite is a functional spacecraft weighing less than a penny,” said Dr. Mason Peck.  “Sprites on Deep Space missions will be revolutionary new tools for gathering data across wide areas of interest, both on and around asteroids.”</p>
<p>“A profitable asteroid industry is upon us,” said David Gump, Vice Chair and Director of Marketing for Deep Space.  “During the current prospecting phase, Deep Space revenue sources include providing data to scientists and NASA, and enabling corporate marketers to activate their customers through direct  participation in the asteroid adventure.”</p>
<p>The two system concept studies start next month and will be completed in six months in support of the agency’s Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM).  The full NASA announcement of the contract awards is at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-selects-studies-for-the-asteroid-redirect-mission/" target="_blank">www.nasa.gov/asteroidinitiative.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #ffffff;"><em>Daniel Faber To Lead Space Resources Company</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">HOUSTON, Texas – June 5, 2014 – Deep Space Industries announced today that Daniel Faber has been promoted to <del cite="mailto:mac%20user" datetime="2014-06-04T17:27"> </del>Chief Executive Officer of the space resources company.  Meanwhile, former CEO  and company co-founder David Gump is moving into the role of Vice Chair and Director of Marketing and Communications.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">“Daniel is a team builder who combines both technology expertise and entrepreneurial experience in the space field,” said Gump.  “He is perfect for the steps we are taking in the next months and years, as we roll out our first spacecraft and missions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Faber represents a new generation of space leaders, and has worked on a number of Micro- and Nano-Satellites, including the asteroid-hunting Near Earth Object Surveillance Satellite, the MOST and BRITE space telescopes, and the Triton-1 ship-tracking CubeSat.  Prior to Deep Space, Faber ran several start-up companies, performed project management, systems engineering, software development, integration, testing and flight control for several companies including Innovative Solutions in Space BV (ISIS), Heliocentric Technologies, SpaceQuest Canada, and Dynacon Inc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">“Deep Space Industries represents the future of commercial space beyond LEO, and Faber represents the sort of young, can-do leaders who can get us there,” said Deep Space Chair Rick Tumlinson. “He is already putting together a five-star team of innovative young engineers to work with our founders – the world’s top experts in space resources, engineering and science.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Faber steps up from Chief Operating Officer at Deep Space, where he managed planning and development for the company’s commercial satellite and asteroid prospecting spacecraft.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">He takes the helm of Deep Space at a time of accelerated development and expansion of the company, as it secures its position in the new space resources industry. Since its public debut in early 2013, Deep Space has taken a leading role in providing NASA with input to its Asteroid Redirect Mission, has secured its initial commercial customers and begun work on its first spacecraft for an as-yet unannounced project.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">“I am honored to be given this job and will work hard to stay ahead of such an amazing team,” said Faber. “I’ve been on many space projects, but being chosen to lead Deep Space beats them all. These are some of the most talented and knowledgeable people on the planet, with the best plan, best ideas and most well thought out approach to opening the solar system I know of. Just watch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In his new role, Gump will be in charge of all marketing and outward facing communications for Deep Space, including government customers and the development of commercial sponsorships and media campaigns.  Gump, best known for creating the  first television commercial to be shot on the International Space Station (ISS), a Father’s Day spot for RadioShack that was produced in 2001, was the founder of LunaCorp and co-founded the spacecraft firm t/Space to become a finalist in the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition to carry payloads to the ISS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">“The right team for the right job is critical. Deep Space is about creating a future that is grand and amazing, yet built on a solid reality of step by step progress upwards,” said Tumlinson. “This new leadership structure shows we are always moving forward, always innovating and always adapting as we continue our work to find, harvest and develop the resources of space for humanity.”</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><em>BitSat Design Study Announced</em></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GA. – April 23, 2014 – Bitcoins took one small step towards space today with the announcement of a preliminary design contract between Jeff Garzik’s Dunvegan Space Systems and Deep Space Industries Inc. as part of a drive to develop an orbital system for the not-for-profit BitSat project. The BitSats will comprise an orbital node for the bitcoin network now on Earth with a constellation of tiny BitSats continuously broadcasting the latest bitcoin block from orbit, enhancing the resiliency of bitcoin in the event of disruptions or outages to the terrestrial bitcoin P2P mesh network.</p>
<p>“Private spaceflight is breaking big, driving down costs so that great ideas like BitSats are within reach of even volunteer nonprofits,” said Garzik, who is organizing a donation-supported campaign to build and fly the system. “We want to keep bitcoin healthy and free by finding alternative ways to distribute block chain data.”</p>
<p>Bitcoin transactions become official once a group of them are encoded – or “solved” by independent computing efforts &#8212; into a block and added to the blockchain, a record of every bitcoin transfer ever made. BitSats broadcasting the most recently solved blocks will provide a cross-check to verify that the blocks available on the terrestrial network haven’t been spoofed, as well as providing the latest blocks to locations off the terrestrial grid.</p>
<p>“Deep Space has always said we are about using space resources – this includes space itself,” said Rick Tumlinson, the company’s Chairman. “While this announcement may surprise some people, it is actually very much in line with our spacecraft development plans, including another private spacecraft system we will be announcing in a few months that will use many of the same components and systems. This means much lower costs &#8211; very important for the donation-based BitSat effort.”</p>
<p>BitSats may employ the CubeSat standard of individual cubes 10 cm (4 inches) on a side, with one to three such cubes potentially making up each BitSat. They will be sent into orbit as hitchhikers on the launch of much larger satellites, lowering the cost of placing them in orbit.</p>
<p>“I believe space holds the promise of our future, and also offers a lot of utility right now,” said Garzik. “I chose DSI for this project based on depth of their proposal, the expertise they have internally and within their network and the fact that they are pushing the cutting edge – just as we are at Dunvegan.”</p>
<p>Deep Space Industries will develop detailed requirements for the space and ground segments of a BitSat constellation, and preliminary plans for the architecture, operations concept, and spacecraft design. The resulting blueprint for next steps will be published in August for open community evaluation at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitsat-project. Dunvegan Space Systems is collecting donations for the BitSat project via the bitcoin address 1M9MyyPsAak7zRjW4D96pTxDaAEpDDZLR7 processing through payment processor BitPay.</p>
<p>“The goal is to design a downlink system from the satellites to the public that is as open and inexpensive as possible,” said Daniel Faber, the chief operating officer for Deep Space. “While most people will buy their downlink setups from a vendor, ideally a smart hobbyist should be able to download a design and build their own receiver from much less than $10,000.”</p>
<h4>ABOUT DUNVEGAN SPACE SYSTEMS</h4>
<p>Dunvegan Space Systems is an early stage spaceflight micro-company. DSS operates the non-profit BitSat project. A strong proponent of private spaceflight and open source, DSS believes the private spaceflight industry is best incentivized through small, cost effective, attainable missions based on open designs. The BitSat project fits within that larger vision. Dunvegan Space Systems is exploring technologies and business models whose goal is a solar system wired for networking, with data centers on Luna and Mars. These missions and business models are made possible through expanded competition and lower costs in the launch and spacecraft manufacturing industries. Through the design and eventual deployment of the BitSat constellation, Dunvegan Space seeks to demonstrate that a functional space-based network may be developed at low cost.</p>
<h4>ABOUT DEEP SPACE INDUSTRIES:</h4>
<p>Deep Space Industries is a space operations, exploration and resources company. With several billionaires and nations competing to reduce the cost of launching into orbit and announcing plans for facilities and voyages into the Solar System, Deep Space is moving into position to supply the materials and propellant needed to cut the cost of staying and operating beyond the Earth. Deep Space is tapping “local” in-space resources such as near Earth asteroids, starting with a prospecting campaign to find the richest targets, and then developing cost-effective ways to process asteroid materials into products for the in-space markets. Steps now underway include developing space capabilities, a knowledge base and top level expertise in all aspects of space related to the discovery and production of space resources and enhancing low-cost space commerce, from spacecraft systems design, operations, astrodynamics, science and resource utilization as well as user and broad customer/community development.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA SELECTS DEEP SPACE INDUSTRIES<br />
FOR MULTIPLE ASTEROID PRESENTATIONS</p>
<p>HOUSTON, TEXAS – Sept. 4, 2013 – After evaluating more than 400 proposals submitted by industry and academic experts, NASA has selected Deep Space Industries to make three presentations during its three-day Asteroid Initiative Idea Synthesis Workshop later this month.</p>
<p>The 400 proposals were responses to a NASA Request for Information (RFI) about the best way to detect, characterize and utilize near Earth asteroids (NEAs).  More than two million NEAs orbit the Sun in roughly the same path taken by Earth, and thus represent potential collision threats as well as potential sources of propellant and building materials to make in-space operations less expensive.</p>
<p>According to the NASA notice posted at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/asteroid-initiative-idea-synthesis-workshop/">http://www.nasa.gov/content/asteroid-initiative-idea-synthesis-workshop/</a>, the Deep Space submissions were selected based on their “relevance to the RFI objectives, innovativeness of the idea, maturity of the development approach, and potential to improve mission affordability.”  </p>
<p>The workshop runs Sept. 30-Oct. 2 at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.</p>
<p>The presentations by Deep Space Industries (DSI) Chairman Rick Tumlinson and CEO David Gump propose several improvements to NASA’s asteroid initiative:</p>
<p>&#8211; The first step in the Asteroid Initiative should be sending out low-cost robotic scouts to photograph and collect data about potential asteroid targets.  No images have ever been taken of NEAs smaller than 500 meters, a knowledge gap with consequences for planetary defense and resource development. (For example a 100 meter asteroid can potentially destroy an entire city/region).</p>
<p>&#8211; Rather than attempt to find and deliver to Earth orbit a tiny, complete 8-10 meter asteroid, the goal should be to collect material from the surface of an easier-to-find larger asteroid.  In addition, the collected bags of asteroid material will pose no threat to Earth’s surface should control be lost over their trajectory.</p>
<p>&#8211; Delivering large quantities of asteroid material to Earth orbit should be done on a commercial basis with NASA as one of the customers, alongside industrial users.  NASA’s asteroid delivery plan is to have crew in its Orion capsule visit the returned material in 2021 at a beyond-the-Moon rendezvous point and bring back only 100 kg out of the 100 to 500 tonnes available there.  A commercial approach would plan for industrial use of the remainder from the very start of the mission.  A commercial approach also would enable greater public involvement through the use of corporate sponsorships that NASA is barred from employing.</p>
<p>DSI is developing systems and technologies to prospect, harvest and transform raw asteroid ore into commercial products for in-space markets, where users such as communications satellite operators now pay $17 million per ton to get propellant and components launched from Earth.  Propellant also is needed to sustain the orbits of space stations and other facilities now in development.  Asteroid metals will be fabricated into components that expand the capabilities of in-space infrastructure, such as larger communications satellites and arrays. The ability to harvest space resources and carry out industrial processes in space will be the cornerstone of our future in space.</p>

<strong>Asteroid Mining Company Announces Retail Site<br />
<a href="http://www.deepspacebydesign.com">Deep Space by Design</a> Profits to Support Space Projects</strong></p>
<p>HOUSTON, Texas (August 26, 2013) – While you may not be able to get there yet, Deep Space Industries is offering you the chance to participate in the opening of space while showing the world you are in the know, be it on your wall, on your desk or even on your body. </p>
<p>Deep Space, known for its goal of mining asteroids, today announced its retail division “Deep Space by Design”. Much more than a swag site or company store, <a href="http://www.deepspacebydesign.com">Deep Space by Design</a> offers high quality and sometimes edgy space related products including: clothing, art, jewelry, and exclusive products such as rare one of a kind meteorites through a partnership with “Meteorite Man” Geoff Notkin’s Aerolite Meteorites. And in a unique twist for online retailing, a portion of every sale will go to fund actual space projects.</p>
<p>“The concept of Deep Space by Design is something new. We aren’t just selling swag, we are offering people a chance to participate in space exploration and development while making a statement,” said Deep Space Chairman Rick Tumlinson. “While buying a T-shirt or coffee cup anywhere else may help a company’s bottom line, when you buy from DSbD we guarantee that a portion of the profit will help a real space engineer to work on a real space project.”</p>
<p>DSbD’s store ranges from “Kiss My Asteroid” T-shirts to an exotic Siberian meteorite that blasted in from space with a glow that outshone the Sun.  (Asteroids become meteorites when they enter the atmosphere.)   The site features a blend of humorous and visionary text with contemporary design and real science based products. </p>
<p>“DSbD will be constantly expanding and growing our product line, always with an eye towards what is cool and chic,” said Jasmine Johns, DSbD Marketing Director. “Sure, we have the basics; T-shirts and baseball caps, yet even these aren’t the usual low-end internet products, but high quality name brands such as Port Authority and Fruit of the Loom. From there we go straight up to signed art pieces, and soon we will roll out unique fashion and couture items available nowhere else.”</p>
<p>In coming months, Deep Space by Design will add products from not-for-profit organizations, an exclusive to DSbD high-fashion space-inspired clothing line, baby and kids clothes, bomber jackets, and even more irreverent T-shirts and items like the “Kiss my Asteroid!” line.</p>
<p>“The goal is to offer high end, edgy and unique products that start conversations and open people’s minds to the opening of space,” said DSbD’s Paul Fuller. “We want to share the wonder, the fun and the attitude of the frontier, all while helping pay to open it for everyone.”</p>
