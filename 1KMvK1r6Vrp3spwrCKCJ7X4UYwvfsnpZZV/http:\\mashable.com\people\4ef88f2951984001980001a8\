In 2011, the Foundation committed $30 million over three years to non-profit organizations dedicated to improving the homes and lives of economically disadvantaged veterans.\n\nAprons in Action will tap Home Depot's 250,000+ Facebook fans to help place that money in worthy hands. Each month, the Facebook competition will feature four community improvement projects to be completed by company volunteers and a local non-profit. Users can then vote between those projects to determine which gets a $25,000 Home Depot gift card. All featured projects will at least receive $5,000 in gift cards.\n\nThose monthly winners (11 in total) will then be put into another competition for a larger grant of $250,000. There will also be runner up grants worth $150,000 and $100,000. By the end of the program, Aprons in Action will have donated $1 million. It's no small number, and adds to the $270 million the Foundation has already donated to non-profits since its formation in 2002. \n\n\u201cSocial media and philanthropy are a natural fit,\u201d said Kelly Caffarelli, president of the Foundation, in a release.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing that\u2019s a little different here is getting people to support a cause they feel good about, letting them use our money to do it and giving our associates a chance to amplify their impact in their hometowns.\u201d\n\nCrowdsourced philanthropy has become a trend in social good, but its effects are still unclear. Opening up competitions to the public is a great way to increase reach and turn your audience into evangelists. By canvassing for votes, your fans not only share your brand by also promote a good cause close to their heart. Crowdsourced voting, however, can sometimes overtake the cause at hand as organizations push for more votes in order to \"win\" rather than to \"help.\"\n\nTo be sure, this isn't always the case. Home Depot is helping to alleviate this possibility by providing benefits and financial support to all its featured projects. \n\nWhat do you make of using crowdsourcing as a tool for social good and online giving? What is Home Depot doing right? What could it do better?

He's also under fire from hacktivist group Anonymous, who leaked hundreds of his office's emails on Monday.\n\nWhile Anonymous is infamous for its hacking know-how, it doesn't take a genius computer programmer to guess one of the passwords commonly used by Assad's office accounts: 12345. The string of consecutive numbers is the second-weakest password according to a 2011 study. \n\nAnonymous broke into the mail server of the Syrian Ministry of Presidential Affairs, accessing some 78 inboxes of Assad's staffers, according a report from Israeli daily Haaretz. The password 12345 was associated with several of the accounts. \n\nMansour Fadlallah Azzam, the minister of presidential affairs and Bouthaina Shaaban, Assad's media adviser, were among the victims of the inbox hacks.\n\nHaaretz obtained and published one email that included documents intended to prepare the Syrian leader for his December 2011 interview with Barbara Walters. In the interview, Assad claimed the Syrian government was not killing its people.  \n\n\"We don't kill our people,\" Assad told ABC \"No government in the world kills its people, unless it's led by a crazy person.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: 25 Worst Passwords of 2011 [STUDY]\n\nIn the leaked email, Syrian spokesperson at the U.N. Sheherazad Jaafari advised Shabaan and Luna Chebel, a former Al Jazeera reporter and current Assad staffer, on what the Syrian president should say to manipulate Americans:\n\n \"It is hugely important and worth mentioning that 'mistakes' have been done in the beginning of the crises because we did not have a well-organized 'police force.' American psyche can be easily manipulated when they hear that there are 'mistakes' done and now we are 'fixing it.' It's worth mentioning also what is happening now in Wall Street and the way the demonstrations are been suppressed by policemen, police dogs and beatings.\n\n\"The major points and dimensions that have been mentioned a lot in the American media are: The idea of violence has been one of the major subjects brought up in every article. They use the phrases 'The Syrian government is killing its own people,' 'Tanks have been used in many cities,' 'Airplanes have been used to suppress the peaceful demonstrations,' and 'Security forces are criminals and bloody.'\"\n\nJaafari's email also advised that Assad should emphasize the openness of Facebook and YouTube to show the true situation in Syria. Press entry restrictions should be spun as a proactive measure not to have foreign journalists misrepresent the country.\n\nWhat do you think of Anonymous's vigilante role in international affairs?

Targets are selected because of a perceived injustice: police brutality, Internet censorship or the rich oppressing the poor. \n\nOnce perceived as a minor nuisance, Anonymous is getting some serious attention: According to the Wall Street Journal, the Director of the National Security Agency, or NSA, has cautioned that Anonymous could have the capability to knock out power in the U.S. through cyberattacks within the next one to two years.\n\nNSA director Gen. Keith Alexander issued his warning in private government meetings, and Anonymous hasn't yet been added to any public \"threat list.\" However Alexander, and other government officials, have expressed growing concern about America's vulnerability to cyberattack. President Obama's proposed 2013 budget, for example, considers cyberattacks to be among the \u201cemerging threats for which the United States must be prepared,\" alongside nuclear war and terrorism.\n\nSEE ALSO: Anonymous Hacks Syrian President\u2019s Email. The Password: 12345\n\nAnonymous' attacks have typically come in the form of a \"Distributed Denial of Service,\" or DDoS, where a target website's server is overloaded with fake traffic and rendered useless, but a power grid knockout is a much more complex operation. There is some doubt over whether or not Anonymous could (or would) pull off such an attack. However, Internet security experts acknowledge that cyberwarfare is a growing problem and are ramping up defenses to prevent digital catastrophe.\n\n\"The industry is engaged and stepping up widely to respond to emerging cyber threats,\" an electric-industry official told The Wall Street Journal. \"There is a recognition that there are groups out there like Anonymous, and we are concerned, as are other sectors.\"\n\nOther countries, such as China and Russia, are believed by some to be developing cyberwarfare plans against the U.S. alongside regular warfare if conflict ever breaks out. Plus, America's current enemies could be interested in attacking the digital infrastructure of the U.S. as well. If Anonymous or other similar groups were \"hired\" by these countries or organizations, the hackers could more quickly become a threat to the U.S.\n\nAn Anonymous-affiliated blog called the NSA director's concerns \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Why should Anonymous shut off power grid?,\" said the post. \"Makes no sense! They just want you to feel afraid.\"\n\nDo you think Anonymous could or would attack U.S. power grids? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nWhat is Anonymous?

The site, which billed itself as \"the leading online storage and file delivery service,\" is now offline.\n\nIn the indictment, Megaupload and a company associated with it are accused of making $175 million while simultaneously causing approximately half a billion dollars in copyright infringement. Among the indicted are the site's founder, Kim Dotcom (a.k.a. Kim Schmitz), who holds residency in New Zealand and Hong Kong. Employees Bram van der Kolk, aka Bramos, 29, Julius Bencko, Finn Batato, Sven Echternach, Mathias Ortmann, and Andrus Nomm were also indicted.\n\nNew Zealand authorities arrested Dotcom, Batato, Ortmann and van der Kolk. Officials said they have not yet captured Bencko, Echternach and Nomm.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the accused are part of \"the Mega Conspiracy, a worldwide criminal organization whose members engaged in criminal copyright infringement and money laundering on a massive scale.\" They are being charged with participating in a racketeering conspiracy, conspiring to commit copyright infringement, conspiring to commit money laundering and two substantive counts of criminal copyright infringement. \n\nShould they be found guilty, the seven accused could find themselves behind bars for a maximum of 20 years.\n\nThe indictment and subsequent arrests come only a day after major websites blacked out and rallies were held to protest SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (PROTECT IP Act), two Internet piracy bills currently under debate in the U.S. Congress.\n\nSome 15 minutes after the indictment, the online hacker group Anonymous tweeted from a Sweden-based account that it had retaliated against the DOJ:\n\n#OpPayBack Target: DOWN justice.gov - 15 minutes after feds announce arrest of Megaupload 7, #Anonymous strikes #svpol\u2014 Anonymous Sweden (@AnonOpsSweden) January 19, 2012\n\nSoon afterwards, justice.gov was inaccessible -- and it remains down at time of writing:\n\nThe websites of the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) and Universal Music Group were also experiencing either intense slowdowns or complete failure.

The company will offer its members 12 months of global identity protection for free.\n\nStratfor, based out of Texas, offers information on geopolitics, terrorism, and industry and country forecasts for businesses and government agencies who subscribe to the site. This information is summarized in a daily newsletter with updates and analysis. Some of their clients include the Department of Defense, Bank of America and Apple.\n\nTheir website launch is being delayed due to the hacking incident, as concerns grow over the content of the data the group stole.\n\nHacker collective Anonymous claimed responsibility for the operation known as \"Antisec.\" Hackers stole 3.3 million emails from the website as well as assorted credit card information.\n\nStratfor has issued a statement saying the hacker group exaggerated the extent of information obtained. The company denies that Anonymous was able to successfully uncover a list of private clients.\n\n\"Contrary to this assertion the disclosure was merely a list of some of the members that have purchased our publications and does not comprise a list of individuals or entities that have a relationship with Stratfor beyond their purchase of our subscription-based publications,\" the firm said in an email to its members on Dec. 25.\n\nStratfor recommended that clients whose information was compromised alert their credit card companies to watch for suspicious activity. So far, Anonymous has leaked credit card data, but threatened to release all stolen documents causing \"mayhem.\"\n\nWe reached out to the Anonymous spokesperson via Twitter who explained that operation Antisec, like most ops, did not have all \"anons\" behind it. They would not give details about the data stolen or how many hackers were involved. Anonymous frames themselves as a group seeking complete online freedom and demanding transparency with government and business information.\n\nThe Stratfor hack was just the latest incident in a year full of security mishaps. Sony's PlayStation Network was hacked earlier this spring. Also this spring, hacking group LulzSec gained attention for for successfully hacking into parts of websites owned by Sony Pictures, the CIA and the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe nature of these attacks underscores the need for robust security audits at firms and corporations of all sizes. \n\nWhat do you think of this latest attack?

As more of the physical encampments are evicted across the U.S., digital meeting places will be of increased importance, explains a November RoarMag blog post.\n\n\"In addition to the local squares, we now need a global square where people of all nations can come together as equals to participate in the coordination of collective actions and the formulation of common goals and aspirations. For this reason, we call upon the revolutionary whizkids of the world to unite and assist in the development of a new online platform \u2013 The Global Square \u2013 that combines the communicative functions of the existing social networks with the political functions of the assemblies to provide crucial new tools for the development of our global movement.\"\n\nThe Global Square will include an interactive map of uprisings around the world, an easy search option to find movements near you, a Facebook-style news feed, calendars, debate forums, collaboration space, messaging and more. Unlike Twitter and Facebook, Wired reports that to become a member, you will need a sponsor to ensure you are trustworthy. The site is expected to launch in January.\n\nSEE ALSO: 9 Social Media Uprisings That Sought to Change the World in 2011\n\nThis is not the first tech innovation we've seen spurred by the Occupy movement. OWS broadcaster Tim Pool is creating new reporting techniques, hackathons have united programmers and the Free Network Foundation brought free Wi-Fi to Zuccotti Park. \n\nEstablished social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, are considered to have been at the center of revolutions across the world this year. However, members of the Occupy movement fear these networks would turn over private messages, when confronted by authorities.\n\nIn January, ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak shut off the country's Internet in fear of the power of social networks. Last week, a Massachusetts district attorney subpoenaed Twitter for private messages from the @OccupyBoston Twitter account. \n\nDo you think The Global Square is filling a void for activists, or are the existing mainstream networks sufficient?

The first Anonymous hack resulted in stolen emails and credit card data from Stratfor, an Austin-based think tank that concentrates on security issues.\n\nOne alleged conspirator said the goal was to use that credit card data to steal a million dollars, and give the money away as Christmas donations, the AP reports. Online images, posted to Twitter, show receipts from the donations. \n\nTwitter account @YourAnonNews, which is supposedly linked to the group, tweeted Sunday that the reason it was able to steal the credit card data was because it had not been encrypted by Stratfor -- an embarrassing mistake for a company specializing in security.\n\nHappy LulzXmas @STRATFOR | Thanks for storing your customers' CC/CCV #s in cleartext, w/corresponding addresses. Y u no bother encrypting?\u2014 Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) December 25, 2011\n\nAmong the private clients on Stratfor's tightly-guarded list -- whose information Anonymous accessed -- are the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force and the Miami Police Department. The list also includes banks, law enforcement agencies, defense contractors, and technology firms such as Apple and Microsoft, the AP reports. \n\n~4000 credit cards, md5 pws, and home addys to the [A] section of Stratfor's \"private client list\" |pastebin.com/bQ2YHDdw | Happy #LulzXmas\u2014 Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) December 25, 2011\n\nAnonymous also posted images showing receipts of charitable donations made to non-profits. One theft victim, Alan Barr of Austin, did not know his credit card data had been stolen until an AP reporter called him for comment. \n\n\"It was all charities, the Red Cross, CARE, Save the Children. So when the credit card company called my wife she wasn't sure whether I was just donating,\" Barr said. \n\n@YourAnonNews tweeted that Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift were among the next targets. \n\nWhat do you think of Anonymous' ironic first target of the week? Who's next?\n\nUPDATE: A press release is circulating, saying that the Stratfor hack is not the work of Anonymous. However, it is difficult to tell who is correct. \n\nBONUS: What Is Anonymous?"},"shares":{"linked_in":469,"digg":3,"facebook":238,"twitter":2017,"google_plus":75,"stumble_upon":2615,"total":5417},"comments_count":19,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ1L2Fub255bW91c2hhLmRSWC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/9ee17cdf/fc6/anonymous-hacks-company-that-specializes-in-security-d21e15e4d1.jpg","responsive_images":null,"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/rQvJI8","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"brightcove":[{"id":1331714623001,"data-video":1331714623001,"class":"content-brightcove"}]},"excerpt":"Hacker group Anonymous began its promised week of Christmas hacks, assaulting a long list of targets.
