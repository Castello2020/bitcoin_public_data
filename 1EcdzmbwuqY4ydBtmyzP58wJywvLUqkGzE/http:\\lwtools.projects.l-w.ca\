<h3>About LWTOOLS</h3>

<p>LWTOOLS is a set of cross-development tools for the Motorola 6809 and Hitachi 6309
microprocessors. It supports assembling to raw binaries, CoCo LOADM
binaries, and a proprietary object file format for later linking. It
also supports macros and file inclusion among other things.</p>

<p>LWTOOLS was born in 2006 when William Astle decided that none of the
crossassemblers available at the time supported all the features he wanted
to use. After over two years of intermittent development, and three separate releases
of LWASM and one separate release of LWLINK, LWTOOLS had it's initial
release on January 29, 2009.</p>

<p>You can read the manual for LWTOOLS version 4.0 online
as a <a href="manual/manual.html">single HTML page</a>, <a
href="manual/">multiple HTML pages</a>, or as a <a
href="manual/manual.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone wishes to support further development of LWTOOLS, I accept
bitcoin donations at the following address:
1EcdzmbwuqY4ydBtmyzP58wJywvLUqkGzE. I also accept USD and CAD by post.
Contact me for details. If you have a pet feature you want added to the
tools, you might be able to motivate me to implement it for a sufficient
bribe.</p>

<h3>Building from Source</h3>

<p>On a reasonable system, lwtools should build from the source by simply
running &quot;make&quot; at the top level of the source directory.  The
various binaries will be in the lwasm, lwlink, and lwar directories when
done.  &quot;make install&quot; will install the binaries to
/usr/local/bin/.</p>

<p>It is possible to build Windows binaries using the <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/">mingw</a> system. Install the complete
development system in addition to the C compiler and the basic MSYS system.
Then, running under the mingw shell, the same procedure as for reasonable
systems above will work. The exe files will be in the directories mentioned
above. Note that you can access your &quot;C&quot; drive at /c in mingw
which should allow you to find your downloaded lwtools tar archive.</p> 

<h3>Third Party Contributions</h3>

<p>Various third party contributions are presented <a
href="contrib/">here</a>. Third party contributions are provided as is. Any
problems with any third party contribution should be directed to the
originator of the contributions. For obvious reasons, I cannot provide any
support for anything provided by third parties.</p>

<p>Of particular interest to those of you running on Windows are Tormod's
windows binaries in <a href="contrib/tormod/">contrib/tormod</a>. Again,
these are provided for your convenience but are not officially
supported.</p>

<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p>The following released versions are available. Please do not report bugs
in older releases unless they are present in the latest release. Old
releases are provided for archaeological purposes only.</p>

<ul>

<li><b><i>2014-04-11</i>:</b> <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.10.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.10</a>. This version
has some minor updates for source code compatibility. It also has an
important bug fix for the downward growing section support added to lwlink
in the previous release. The most notable addition to this release is
support for Motorola SREC and Intel Hex output formats.</li>

<li><b><i>2014-01-10</i>:</b> <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.9.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.9</a>.  This version
has various bug fixes that may affect code that seemed to be correct before. 
It now checks for byte overflows for forced 8 bit offset modes relative to
index registers or PC.  It also has some added linker functionality (notably
placing sections from high memory downward).

</li>

<li><b><i>2013-06-13</i>:</b> <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.8.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.8</a>.  This version
contains various improvements to the build system and some various
corrections to some source file formatting and other errors which were
causing problems or warnings on some platforms.  It also fixes a crash
related to noexpand macros.  It also forces binary mode when opening files
to avoid issues on certain platforms with non-transparent ascii file
handling. Also, notably prevents crashing on division by zero in source
code. Various other fixes for crash bugs and other fairly specialized
problems are also included, including several specific to the os9 target.</li>


<li><b><i>2013-01-23</i>:</b> <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.7.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.7</a>. This version
comes with the usual collection of minor fixes including fixing a problem
with [,u] in 6809 only mode. It also has several new features which may be
of interest to some.</li>

<li><b><i>2012-06-10</i>:</b> <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.6.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.6</a>. This version
comes with the usual collection of minor fixes. It also fixes an inversion
that swapped the meanings of the --6809 and --6309 switches to lwasm. Also
of note is that the autobranchlength pragma in lwasm now works much more
usefully on forward references.</li>

<li><a href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.5.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.5</a>. This
version comes with a raft of minor fixes including a major speedup in
resolving forward references which will be most noticeable on large source
files. Download the <a href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.5.tar.gz">source
code</a>.</li>

<li><a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.4.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.4</a>.
This version fixes a critical code generation bug with 16 bit relative
branch instructions which was introduced in version 4.3.
Download the <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.4.tar.gz">source
code</a>.
</li>

<li><a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.3.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.3</a>.
<em>*** Don't use this release--See 4.4 above***</em>
This release fixes several bugs, notably related to building OS9 modules. It
also contains a new pragma, autobranchlength, which allows the assembler to
decide whether to use a long or short branch as needed for any branch
instruction. It also comes with a --define command line switch to allow
specifying symbol values on the command line.

I do not have a properly
functional build environment for Windows so no binaries at this time. If
anyone is willing to contribute such, let me know. Download the <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.3.tar.gz">source
code</a>.
</li>

<li><a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.2.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.2</a>.
This version fixes a number of memory leaks, an incorrect malloc() size,
problems with *pragma and ifdef, and adds a &quot;nolist&quot; pramga to
suppress portions of the listing when using --list. It also corrects errors
handling &amp;-prefixed decimal constants and %-prefixed binary constants.
This version may or may not compile and work properly under Windows. I am
informed that some of the fixes have helped. I do not have a properly
functional build environment for Windows so no binaries at this time. If
anyone is willing to contribute such, let me know. Download the <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.2.tar.gz">source
code</a>.
</li>


<li><a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.1.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.1</a>.
This version fixes a couple of code generation errors, one of which affects
a relatively uncommon indexed mode. It also has a few functional regressions
against the 3.x versions fixed so it should now work as a backend for
gcc6809. See the extras/ folder for more information.
Download the <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.1.tar.gz">source
code</a>. Sorry, no Windows binaries at this time. I don't have Windows so I
can't test Windows builds and given the problems that have occurred with
them in the past, I feel it would be a disservice to provide binaries that
may or may not work. If anyone with a function Windows build environment (32
or 64 bit) is willing to compile, I'll post the resulting binaries here.
</li>


<li><a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.0.tar.gz">LWTOOLS 4.0</a>.
A new version of lwtools is out, now freshly freed from autotools hell. This
is the first release after a major reorganization and retooling of the code
to remove dependence on autotools for portability. As such, there may be
bugs. It is, however, capable of assembling Color Basic and Extended Color
Basic correctly. Download the <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.0.tar.gz">source
code</a> or the <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.0-win.zip">win32/win64
binaries</a>. Note that there have been reports of problems with the windows
builds on some systems, notably Windows 7. If someone is willing to take on
the task of maintaining a Windows port of lwtools, please contact me.<br>
Aaron Wolfe has kindly provided <a
href="releases/lwtools/lwtools-4.0-win64.zip">these win64
binaries</a> which may work better than the ones in the windows binaries
package above.

<p>The source code is also available from the project's mercurial
repository which can be found at <a

<p>Note that the project originally used subversion. However, on March 18,
2010, it was switched over to mercurial.</p>
<p>Note also that as of January 19, 2011, the old repository was
decommissioned in favour of a new, clean repository. The old repository is
available at <a
href="hg-old/">http://lwtools.projects.l-w.ca/hg-old/</a>
in case anyone wishes to inspect it.</p>
