<h3>&nbsp;What are Bitcoins?</h3>
<div class="well intro-inner">
<p>
Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital monetary system, and "bitcoins" are the currency unit used by this system. The system has existed since January 3rd, 2009 and is used in every country in the world. Bitcoins are created and controlled by advanced mathematics and cryptography, instead of by governments or banks (no government, bank, or corporation owns or controls Bitcoin). Bitcoins as a currency unit are created over time at a diminishing rate, and there will never be more than 21 million of them in existence (though they are highly divisible).</p>
<p><b>Bitcoin is different from systems like Paypal because:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It is decentralized (no group has monopoly control over it)</li>
<li>It is not tied to US dollars or other government fiat currencies</li>
<li>It is impossible to suffer chargebacks or frozen accounts</li>
<li>It is (relatively) anonymous</li>
<li>Fees are optional (you may pay to make your transactions process slightly faster)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, anyone in the world, of any age, in any country, for any purpose, may start accepting and spending Bitcoins immediately. It is a purely free-market currency which every human on the planet has the option of using. It returns the power of money to "the people" and away from "the banks" and "the government."
The supply of bitcoins is mathematically controlled at a pre-determined rate, and cannot be inflated beyond this rate. There is no sign-up or approval process. If you wanted, you could have a Bitcoin account less than three seconds from now... Click here and you will have a Bitcoin account, instantly.</p>

Coinbase provides a means to rapidly transfer funds into, out of and between bitcoin exchanges far faster than the usual methods through automating the entire process. Traditionally, bitcoin exchanges handle deposits and withdrawals using several methods, some of which can be annoyingly slow with delays of up to a week before funds are available for use. During this waiting period, as with any currency, exchange rates can fluctuate and you may not get the same amount you would have been able to at the time you begun your deposit. If you cannot purchase any at this moment, you can start your journey into the bitcoin world by building up your collection of bitcoins gradually.
