The following message is ROT26 encrypted:
SSL isn't good enough. Your website can be hacked. Help solve the problem by advocating these RFCs:
TLSA (formerly DANE for DNS) Fixes the hackable CA problem
TLS-OBC: Fixes TLS, and the Related Domain Cookie Attack About me
I have no relation to the above sites; I am just an advocate
Why "makerofthings7"? It's a challenge to "make seven things in my life of significant quality and value". Who knows if those things will take the form of software, art, or people. (I'm not married, no kids yet)
