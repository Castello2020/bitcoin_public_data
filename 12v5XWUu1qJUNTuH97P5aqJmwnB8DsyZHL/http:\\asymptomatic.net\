	<p>Hello internet.</p><p>I hope you have come here because you've seen my pleas on social media and want to know what I'm raving about.&nbsp; I will explain my concept to you simply:</p><h2><b><span style="color: #f79646;">I want you to send me a photo of you drinking something.</span></b></h2><p>You may have some questions.&nbsp; I will attempt to answer a few:</p><h3>Why?</h3><p>When I was working in Australia, I got a photo of my friend and co-worker, Donal, drinking a Coke Zero.&nbsp; For reasons I can't remember anymore, but probably having to do with returning home to work alone all the time, I printed the photo and tacked it to the wall above my monitor.</p><p><img src="http://ss.owenw.com/2014-05-18_19.22.21.png" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default;"></p><p>Every day I look up at the photo and see Donal there, drinking his Coke Zero, and it gives me a sense of...&nbsp; I dunno, it's just frikkin crazy.</p><p>However, one day I thought about all the people I knew online, who I was connected with one way or another, and how it would be cool to have photos of all of them, and how it would be especially neat if we could all have a drink together.</p><h3>What are you planning to do with these photos?</h3><p>I'm planning to print them out in as high quality wallet size as I can, then put them in a frame that I will construct specifically for that purpose.&nbsp; I will hang the frame on the wall in my office.&nbsp; Hopefully Donal will send me a new photo of himself, so I can replace the curling laser-printed paper.</p><p>It will look something like these, but in a much wider and taller grid of wallet-sized photos:</p><p><img src="http://ss.owenw.com/2014-05-18_19.34.14.png" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default;"></p><h3>Will there be an electronic edition of the photos?</h3><p>I currently have no plan to produce a sheet of photos of people drinking that just happen to know me, no.&nbsp; But we'll see.</p><h3>What is the composition of this photo?</h3><p>There are two essential elements:&nbsp; You.&nbsp; Your drink.</p><p>Your drink does not have to be an adult beverage (and for some of you, it probably shouldn't). It would be nice if you included a note saying what your beverage was along with your photo so that I know what you're drinking if it's not otherwise identifiable.&nbsp; Like, if you're drinking beer from a tumbler, you should mention what the beer is.</p><p>You can be drinking the beverage, or just holding it.&nbsp; I prefer the photo not to be completely staged, if possible, but I'll take what I can get.&nbsp; Ideally, the photo should "have interest" -- pose interesting questions about you, where you're drinking, what you're drinking, and why people would like to hang out with you.&nbsp; If you need me to tell you why I'd like to hang out with you for inspiration, I will.</p><p>As for other criteria, it should probably be a decent photo (well lighted, in focus, etc.), and include only you as the centerpiece.&nbsp; I'm not opposed to, for example, you drinking a Shirley Temple next to Mickey Mouse, or you with a beer and an arm around Lucy Lawless, just as long as it's clear that you're the person the photo is about.&nbsp; Remember, it's going to be printed wallet-size, so a photo of you on a Californian cliff with the sun setting over the Pacific in the background while you drink a 50-year-old scotch is very cool, but I'll have to crop all that cool stuff out.</p><p>Beyond that, creativity is yours to command.&nbsp; </p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Oh.&nbsp; No nudes.&nbsp; You're all quite lovely enough with your clothes on, thanks.&nbsp; (Yes, I'm talking to you, Randy Walker.)</span><br></p><h3><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Can I send more than one?</span></h3><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Sure, but I'm only going to pick one for the frame.&nbsp; Pick one or two, maybe three if you're really indecisive, and send them and that'll be fine.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">If you feel like you should be doing more than just sending the one photo, you should convince/help the people that you know who know me to take a photo and send it.&nbsp; Go out with them for a drink, take the photo for them, and then send it!&nbsp; Easy!</span></p><h3>Who can play?</h3><p>Anyone can play, although if I get thousands of photos, I'm probably only going to make a frame to hold so many of them.&nbsp; In that case, the people I <i>actually know</i> are going to get first placement.&nbsp; See, this is about the people I could be drinking with, but can't.&nbsp; Get it?</p><p>This is not to say you shouldn't send a photo.&nbsp; Send a photo.</p><h3>How do we do this thing?</h3><p>You send me a photo.&nbsp; I receive it by <b>June 4th, 2014</b>.&nbsp; If the <i>sheer fun</i> of this project wasn't enough to convince you, then you should know that June 4th is when I celebrate <b>my 40th birthday</b>.&nbsp; Didn't get me a gift?&nbsp; No problem, send me your photo having a drink and we're square.&nbsp; You can get me a gift, too, that's still cool.</p><p>I know it's only 17 days, but <b>my goal is 100 photos</b>.&nbsp; If I got one photo from every person I follow on Twitter, that'd put me over, and I'd have a photo from Tatiana Maslany, which would be, like, Keanu-whoa.</p><p>Here's how you do it:&nbsp; Send your photo file to <b>drinkingbuddy<!-- 
<br><b>stop looking at me!</b>
-->@<!--
you are all evil <i>spammers</i> and I will@ have your hides!&nbsp; -->midnightcircus.com&nbsp;</b></p><p>Easy.</p><p>I'll let you know how it goes.&nbsp; I probably won't start on the frame until I know how many photos will be going in it, but I'll surely post to let you all know how it goes.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your photo!</p>	</div>

	<p>I read a piece by Cory Doctorow called&nbsp;<a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/05/02/standardized-testing-and-schoo.html">Standardized testing and schools as factories: Louis CK versus Common Core</a>&nbsp;which talks about a comedian who dislikes the application of Common Core.</p><p>I'm not writing to defend Common Core, at least not fully.&nbsp; People around our district that talk about it seem to have a limited understanding or a skewed perspective on what it is.&nbsp; I think the problems with Common Core are often not what people most frequently surface.</p><p><img alt="8ef7c930-b44a-11e3-84f5-9547b2943d40_commoncorephoto.png" src="http://asymptomatic.net/user/files/./8ef7c930-b44a-11e3-84f5-9547b2943d40_commoncorephoto.png" width="400" height="538" style=" cursor: default; width: 215.00742115027828px; height: 289px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" unselectable="on">Consider&nbsp;<a href="https://shine.yahoo.com/healthy-living/common-core-parent-facebook-post-indiana-school-181841158.html">this critique</a> of Common Core math homework.&nbsp; It complains that the problem solved with Common Core techniques is significantly more complex than traditional methods.&nbsp; But the traditional method of solving this seemingly simple subtraction problem (427-316) has some problems of its own.</p><p>First, using the "line up the numbers and subtract the bottom from the top" method for the solution is just as much a contrived procedure as the Common Core way.&nbsp; There is no intuitive leap that a child can take that puts these numbers in this layout to ease the subsequent artificial process of subtracting the bottom number from the top.</p><p>Second, if the problem required "borrowing", such as the problem 427-336 might, the traditional method gets much more complicated.&nbsp; In contrast, the Common Core method of solving the problem is <i>exactly the same</i>.</p><p>Third, the Common Core method of solving the problem gives a more complete and fundamental intuitive explanation of <i>why</i>&nbsp;a person can solve the problem in this way.&nbsp; The traditional method doesn't provide any explanation of - when you subtract the 3 from the 4 you get a 1 - what has actually happened to the quantities involved.&nbsp; Having this intrinsic understanding of the number is <i>incredibly important</i>&nbsp;to build on for subsequent math.&nbsp; It's my opinion that lack of emphasis on this understanding when using a traditional approach to teaching math is the reason why our country is lagging so far behind the rest of the world in mathematics concepts!</p><p>I would ask parents who don't understand the Common Core concepts to consider whether they're willing to prepare their children with the appropriate tools for the future.&nbsp; Using the old ways is like giving your child a chunk of clay and only ever showing them that it can make ash trays, when a better understanding of clay's properties and capabilities would be more likely to lead them to great artistry or utility.</p><p>Many complaints I hear about Common Core are from parents that simply don't understand how their kids are being taught a subject.&nbsp; Rather than complain that you can't help them, why don't you try to learn what they're learning at school and participate?</p><p>Now, that said...</p><p>Common Core <i>utterly fails</i>&nbsp;when it comes to evaluation.&nbsp; It presents these concepts in good, new ways, but then insists that everyone learn to produce the results in exactly the same way.&nbsp; This is <i>completely contrary</i>&nbsp;to the advantages that Common Core can deliver!</p><p>Moreover, the standardized testing that Common Core encourages is so extremely gamed by the teachers that it's almost worthless.</p><p>I love (the majority of) our school district's teachers.&nbsp; They're excellent at their jobs, and work in a bad market.&nbsp; And I don't blame them for wanting to do their best to get the best for our kids.&nbsp; Still, once a year for a whole week prior to actually taking them, the teachers focus on how to best take the assessment tests.&nbsp; Not just strategies, but practice tests for the types of problems that will be on the test.</p><p>This isn't the kind of test that you'd want to do well on to get into college.&nbsp; This is an assessment of how well the school is able to convey the Common Core topics to its students.&nbsp; You can see that if you teach to the test, at least in the way I've seen our kids being taught, you're <i>defeating the purpose of the test entirely</i>.</p><p>There is also the case of kids learning at different rates and in different ways.&nbsp; Sometimes, the students don't take tests well, or can't concentrate for the test, but yet be totally competent at the subject matter in a different environment.&nbsp; Some students excel at the work, and are held back by having to study concepts that are well-known to them just so that their classmates can pass a portion of a state-mandated test.&nbsp; Some students need help, and need to be coached through things they don't understand yet, which is not allowed on the test.&nbsp; These are real, common problems that these all too common assessments don't seem to address well.</p><p>The quantity of these tests is astounding, and the importance that our school district lays on them is mind-numbing.&nbsp; If we didn't spend as much time testing constantly, the kids might actually learn twice as much!<span id="pastemarkerend">&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>I don't know what the answer is to these assessments, because clearly, we need to make sure that the students are learning what they need to learn at each level, and that the school is doing what it needs to do to achieve it.&nbsp; But what assessment consists of in a perfect world? I don't know.&nbsp; All I know is that the current situation is not the best case.</p><p>Worse, I believe our schools are suffering by focusing <i>entirely</i>&nbsp;on STEM education, at a detriment to the arts or a more well-rounded and integrated program.&nbsp; Not all of our kids are going to be the scientists of the future.&nbsp; And even those scientists will need a lens through which to interpret the influence, utility, and beauty of their work.</p>	</div>

The Penguin might go fast in the water, but it certainly doesn't through the air of a rocket derby. The Turtle is well known for its slow movement. October's rocket derby featured Riley's Skunk, which took first place.&nbsp; This year's theme?&nbsp; <i>The Squid.</i></p><p>We looked online for some squid designs for inspiration, and found a few good ones.&nbsp; We settled on one and I drew up some mock-ups.&nbsp; Riley liked what we came up with, so we pressed forward.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13412784243" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="http://asymptomatic.net.owenw.com/user/files/flickr.static.fdc04b7437a948ea578d63815e2a542b.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"></a>I'm both surprised and not surprised that nobody asked about the process we used to paint the car.&nbsp; All of the cars were styled differently, and Riley's was certainly done with a different technique from the rest.</p><p>After the car was sealed and primed (which Riley helped with), I transferred the squid design using tracing paper onto the primer coat.&nbsp; I then painted the "water" area with frisket, which is a rubber cement-like substance that covers an area that you don't want to paint, then peels off later.&nbsp; With the frisket dry, Riley used an <i>air brush</i>&nbsp;to paint the squid.&nbsp; The use of the airbrush gave the car a fantastic flat paint quality that a regular brush couldn't come close to.&nbsp; There were some other cars that obviously used spraypaint, but didn't include the frisket for detail.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm happy with how that turned out.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13413052084" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="http://asymptomatic.net.owenw.com/user/files/flickr.static.e8a55f6d72b3a157802dd2d853e877fd.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"></a>I intended to use the frisket again to cover the squid parts and allow Riley to airbrush the water blue, but I was afraid the frisket would take off the squid-colored paint, since we didn't have a lot of time to let it cure to the primer.&nbsp; So instead, I hand-painted the water with some dry-brushed black "seaweed" at the front of the car.&nbsp; This even had the effect of making the blue water look watery, which was a cool side-effect.&nbsp; Overall, I think the car looked great.</p><h2>The Engineering</h2><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13413022674" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="http://asymptomatic.net.owenw.com/user/files/flickr.static.d888448dd2d5d1ab374559032ff690d7.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"></a>The pinewood derby is a hot contest among some scout dads who go into the race for the competition.&nbsp; Some people complain that it becomes a contest between dads, rather than a fun activity for the scouts.&nbsp; I wanted it to be as much of a learning experience for Riley as possible, but it's simply impractical for him to use a band saw at age 9.&nbsp; So I involved him as much as I could, and made sure he understood the science behind the things I was doing to the car, even if he wasn't doing those things directly.</p><p>There were many things we did to make the car go fast.&nbsp; I cut the wood block thinly, with a narrow, "aerodynamic" front, and space in the back for weights.&nbsp; We drilled the axle holes with a tool that guaranteed straight axles, and lifted one wheel entirely from the track to reduce friction.&nbsp; I drilled out holes for the weights in the back of the car, so that the weight could stay on the down-slope for as long as possible to give the car that extra "push".&nbsp; We put&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13412821803" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="http://asymptomatic.net.owenw.com/user/files/flickr.static.6ba948a86e3ccb98edaf1012588ef5e8.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"></a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">slightly more than the allowed 5 ounces of weight in the car with weighted putty, so that we could slowly remove the extra weight and hit the 5 ounce limit from above, rather than trying to raise the weight from below.&nbsp; The wheels were selected for consistent spin and balance from a large set, then the bores were polished.&nbsp; The axles were polished with increasingly finer sandpaper until they were absent of visible scratches under a magnifying glass.&nbsp; The axles were ever-so-slightly bent to allow them to be aligned in a particular way.&nbsp; The alignment of the car was tested and re-tested to go not completely straight, but to allow the three-wheeled car to effectively track the rail while racing.</span></p><p>And that's just the stuff off the top of my head.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13413017304" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="http://asymptomatic.net.owenw.com/user/files/flickr.static.b2e76839bdde5e567b789ebbd2f3a7e6.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"></a>Riley helped with many of these things, and watched the things that were not safe for him to do (or he was too nervous about to handle himself).&nbsp; I was particularly proud of him polishing the axles after I told him it was one of the most important parts.&nbsp; He took to the tedious process and did a great job.</p><p>Overall, I think you can ask Riley about any aspect of the car, and he'll at least know why we did it, if not having had a hand in it himself.&nbsp; I think this combined with having the chance for us to work on a project together are the most important parts of the derby, and I think we did alright.</p><h2>The Race</h2><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13412989704" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2845/13412989704_c987f5b775_c.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default; width: 100%;margin:0px;"></a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I volunteered to chair the race committee in 2015, so I wanted to be involved in the race this year to know how everything was set up.&nbsp; Our pack has a good track record of smooth events, so I feel getting knowledge passed on from a predecessor is an important part of keeping things running smoothly.&nbsp; As such, I showed up early on the day of registration to help set up the race area, the track and electronics, and registration itself.</span></p><p>Our track races four cars at once and uses an electronic timer to detect race starts and finishing places.&nbsp; This is all hooked to a computer with software to schedule races, monitor the race outcomes, and produce the result reports.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13413003474" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="http://asymptomatic.net.owenw.com/user/files/flickr.static.435d9302b03700be28ef024c9f5960ed.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"></a>On the day of the race, I volunteered to place the cars on the track and release the gate to start the race.&nbsp; This was a lot of fun, but also a bit nerve-wracking, since setting a car on the track at the wrong angle could cause it to lose, and many cars were balanced very weirdly, making them harder to place on the track than you might think.&nbsp; Really, it's a complex job!</p><p>The downside of this position is that I could not easily watch the races.&nbsp; There is a mechanism in the release that resets the timer in the electronics, and it was too much of a temptation to reset the release right after the cars crossed the finish line, rather than waiting the appropriate amount of time so that the results could be seen and recorded.&nbsp; The end result is that I didn't actually watch many of the races.&nbsp; In fact, I <i>did</i>&nbsp;watch the very first race (which had Riley's car in it), and I screwed it up, which led me not to watch any of the other races.</p><p>That said, from what I heard and what little I did see myself, Riley's car did very well.&nbsp; His average speed on our track was around 233.7 MPH, scaled to the size of real cars.&nbsp; As far as I know, this average speed was faster than anything else on the track.&nbsp; In many of Riley's races, his car seemed to pull away from the other cars on the flat, which seems to defy a car's capabilities.&nbsp; Really, this is all about weight placement and center of gravity, something that Riley and I spent a lot of time talking about and working on.</p><p>The races were broken into 3 sets of heats.&nbsp; The first set was all 33 cars racing against each other.&nbsp; These races determined winners within each den.&nbsp; The second set was a semi-final, racing the top 16 cars to obtain the top 4 finishers for the pack results.&nbsp; We ended up with some ties in that second set, so our final set of races had 6 racers.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13412623075" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="http://asymptomatic.net.owenw.com/user/files/flickr.static.7a00ce0875be98f699c146b1d9ac59b3.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: default; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"></a>Riley took first place in his den during the initial heats, which earned him a medal.&nbsp; My dad took&nbsp;<a href="https://flic.kr/p/mrnMQ8">video of some of these races</a>.&nbsp; His car placed&nbsp;first in the semi-final, moving on to the final race.&nbsp; In the final set of races, he won the first race, but came in second place for the next two.&nbsp; This was fairly disappointing, considering his consistent first place finishes in all the other races.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Later, we found that the axle locks (small hex screws we used on the bottom of the car to hold the axles in and at a specific position) on three of the wheels had been ripped out of the bottom of the car.&nbsp; The end of the track has some rubber ramps to keep the cars from shooting off the end, and these probably caused the damage.&nbsp; When we handled the wheels, at least one of the axles was very loose, sliding in and out with very little effort.&nbsp; It's surprising that the car did as well as it did in this condition, and I can only assume that had the axle locks held up, Riley would have passed the first place car, just as it had on every prior race in which they had been matched.</span><br></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Still, second place is a great showing, and the races at the end were all very, very close.&nbsp; In fact, the race data shows that Riley's car and the winning car had the exact same average speed in the final set of races, down to the tenths of a MPH.&nbsp; It just nosed out the Squid in those last two races, putting him ahead.&nbsp; Good job, Christopher.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94632485@N00/13412642905" style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img alt="" src="http://asymptomatic.net.owenw.com/user/files/flickr.static.bbba20c9d3ccc1e7ff9cb1874086b114.jpg" unselectable="on" style="cursor: nw-resize; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"></a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">There was also a people's choice award, where the scouts vote for their favorite car design.&nbsp; In previous years, only the top car would receive an award.&nbsp; This year, we did first through third place medals, which I think is a great idea, considering how much time scouts and their parents spend on these cars.&nbsp; Riley's friend, Colin, won second place with his classic Batmobile-like car, which was shaped out of the wood block with a Dremel tool.&nbsp; Pretty cool.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Placing in the top three in our pack means that we get to advance to the district race.&nbsp; This year, the Horseshoe Trail District pinewood derby race will be May 10th at the Exton Mall.&nbsp; I'm excited to see Riley's car compete in this cool public venue, and to actually be able to <i>watch the race!</i>&nbsp; We should have adequate time between now and then to repair the damaged axle locks, and to re-tune the wheels to run perfectly again.&nbsp; There are even some small things that we didn't have time for that I think will make a difference in this race against the best cars in the district.&nbsp; It's exciting to get a chance to race again against Christopher's first place car.</span></p><h2><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Next Year</span></h2><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I have some subtle ideas for improving the race next year.&nbsp; Nothing too fancy, but it could make the experience better for the boys.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Next year, I think I will allow each scout three votes for people's choice instead of just one.&nbsp; It may make tallying a little more complex, but I think it'll even out the distribution.&nbsp; The car that won people's choice this year was another (this is a running theme since we've been in scouts) Minecraft-themed car.&nbsp; It was admittedly a very nicely done car, and in my opinion, deserved first place.&nbsp; But it would be nice to see some leveling-out of the votes.&nbsp; If a kid's first vote goes to the one his friends voted for, then the other two might go to cars based on their actual design.&nbsp; Just a thought.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Also, I'm thinking to make some upgrades and repairs to the track components.&nbsp; The rubber stoppers at the end of the track need replaced.&nbsp; They're very worn and don't always work.&nbsp; We had to put a blanket at the end of the track to catch many of the cars that shot right past the rubber.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I want to do some work on the gate mechanism, so that the gate works the way I've seen on other systems.&nbsp; Our gate is held up by rubber bands.&nbsp; To release the gate, you twist the board that holds the pegs that hold back the cars, and have to <i>hold it down</i> until the race is recorded.&nbsp; What should happen is the gate should be locked in place.&nbsp; When a chuck is pulled, a spring or rubber band should pull the gate open, and it should remain open without holding it until someone lifts it back into place and re-locks it with the chuck.&nbsp; Ideally, the chuck would be controlled by the same computer that records race results.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">That's probably enough change, though I'd love to add that&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.raisinggeeks.com/blog/2012/01/pinewood-derby-instant-replay-system/">instant-replay capability</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;I've seen to our track so that the&nbsp;end of each race can be played in slow-motion on the projector.&nbsp; That would be pretty slick.</span></p>	</div>

	<div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">
	<p>There's a handful of good programs on "TV" these days.&nbsp; Berta and I have been enjoying <i>House of Cards</i>, <i>True Detectives</i>, and <i>The Walking Dead</i>, for example.&nbsp; <i>Game of Thrones</i> is soon to return to the screen, and we watched the first episode of <i>Black Sails</i> last night, which wasn't bad.&nbsp; But none of these shows are appropriate for our kids, aged 9 and 12.</p><p>Well, that's not completely true.&nbsp; There are shows that are designed for 9 or 12-year-olds.&nbsp; But those shows are of no interest to Berta or me.&nbsp; They're all trite and lack complexity.&nbsp; And I'm not against cartoons, but it would be nice to watch something together that's not a cartoon.</p><p>The last thing we really enjoyed watching together <i>was</i>&nbsp;a cartoon, <i>Avatar the Last Airbender</i>. The sequel, <i>Korra</i>, isn't bad, but it's not quite as good.&nbsp; And since there's only that show, we've been turning to other cartoons - recently <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i> - to get that fix of complex theme with kid-approachable topic.</p><p>My conclusion: There is no great family TV.</p><p>I don't want to return to ABC Family Nights and Disney movies.&nbsp; Sure, they're fine, but I think they've drifted and so has their audience.&nbsp; Disney family movies get weirdly preachy while demonstrating child behavior that looks ok but really isn't.&nbsp; For example, they'll show kids sneaking out of bedroom windows like it's a normal thing.&nbsp; Simultaneously, they're ridiculously trite and kid-relationship-heavy.&nbsp; What used to be something the family could enjoy watching together without having heavy-handed lessons has become something I can't stand watching for more than a few minutes.</p><p>At the same time, I would love for these shows to be even more gritty.&nbsp; Our world isn't always the clean, sterile set of <i>7th Heaven</i>.&nbsp; It's why <i>Almost Human</i> is on the edge of attractive to me as a family show.&nbsp; It has complex future themes and nice character banter.&nbsp; It makes you think without forcing the issue.&nbsp; And yet, it's occasionally a bit on the wrong side of discretion for the kids -- A little heavy on the sex, a little heavy on the violence.</p><p><i>Elementary</i> is a favorite show of mine.&nbsp; I would like to watch it with the kids, because it's interesting and complex.&nbsp; Sure, it's not as nuanced as other shows, but it's a good evening's entertainment.&nbsp; That said, it's hit-or-miss with the kids due to its occasional foray into adult themes.&nbsp; Every so often Sherlock comes out of his bedroom with three women, implying things I'd rather not need to explain to 9-year-old Riley.&nbsp; While it's a good show, I'd rather watch a show once with everyone than screen it once with Berta before deciding if it's kid-appropriate and watching it again.</p><p>As a typical American, I'm more ok with violence than sex. We watch <i>Bones</i>, which isn't so much about the violence but the aftermath of the violence.&nbsp; I'm ok with some violence for the kids, since they're unavoidably exposed to it elsewhere in our culture.&nbsp; As long as it's not explicit, gratuitous, or excessive, that's not too bad.&nbsp; The theme of a show can't be violence alone, though.</p><p>I've been re-watching <i>Veronica Mars</i> prior to the upcoming movie release.&nbsp; It's a great show, and just the kind of complex story I'd want the kids to get into.&nbsp; Except for the rape that colors the entire first season.&nbsp; And third season.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; It's not that they shouldn't eventually be exposed to these realities, but that it feels too casual to introduce via a TV program.</p><p>Mind you, I'm not looking to teach any lessons with TV.&nbsp; TV, as far as I'm concerned, is lesson-free mindless recreation.&nbsp; Sure, you can take topics out of TV to discuss, but I don't set out watching a show with the intent to talk to the kids about it afterward.&nbsp; We watch TV with them all too little to bother.&nbsp; I'm really just looking for a show that we can all enjoy, so that we're not forced to wait until after their bed time to turn on a program.</p><p>I'm looking for something squarely between <i>Game of Thrones</i> and <i>Wizards of Waverly Place</i>. No vampires.&nbsp; Ideally, <i>Veronica Mars</i>&nbsp;without going into the sexual themes.&nbsp; Something with some real conflict/intrigue, and that doesn't focus on tween puppy love.</p><p>Got any ideas?</p>	</div>
