	<p>Last weekend, before the storm, I installed Windows 8 on my primary desktop computer.&nbsp; The last and only prior time I installed Windows 8 was in a virtual machine from a developer preview ISO.&nbsp; I was hoping to see some improvements since that initial installation.&nbsp; Here we go...</p><h2>The Good Stuff</h2><p><b>Windows 8 installed without a hitch.</b>&nbsp; Actually, this isn't entirely true, but it's my fault.&nbsp; There was an old instance of Agnitum Outpost firewall that had some lingering bits remaining and was nearly impossible to remove.&nbsp; Until I did, Windows 8's installation would not continue.&nbsp; I think it's fair for Windows to refuse to install until it has the computer in a condition that it thinks would be ideal, and it pays off.</p><p><b>All of my programs that were compatible run just fine.</b>&nbsp; During installation, Windows either made me remove programs that were incompatible or warned me that they would need to be reinstalled to work correctly.&nbsp; Anything that was left, which was most of my applications, worked without any problems.</p><p><b>My Aero problems are gone.&nbsp; And so is Aero.</b>&nbsp; I kind of liked Aero, but anytime I tried to do something intense video-wise, the system would kick me out of Aero mode and everything would move so much slower.&nbsp; Windows 8's default desktop rendering works great -- so much better than Windows 7, in fact.&nbsp; I can run full-screen video on all four monitors and Windows 8 doesn't even cough.&nbsp; Windows 7 would sputter and choke.&nbsp; Mind you, running 15+ videos across three monitors was something I could do on this system in Vista without a hiccup either, so it's nice to see this functionality restored.</p><p><b>Devices just work.</b>&nbsp; I'll give this one to Microsoft.&nbsp; It's hard (there's an understatement) to write an operating system that can handle any 3rd-party hardware thrown at it and simultaneously launch it worldwide in who-knows-how-many languages.&nbsp; When I powered on Windows 8 for the first time, all of my attached peripherals worked.&nbsp; No glitches, period.&nbsp; Flawless execution.&nbsp; It's things like this that people tend to overlook as they move into the next section...</p><h2>The Bad Stuff</h2><p>It's hard to classify Windows 8's "bad stuff" into discrete categories, because my brain categorizes the majority of the complaints I have into a single large group:</p><p><b>My desktop is not a tablet.</b></p><p>And apparently, Microsoft thinks this is my fault.&nbsp; All of the UI decisions that drive me crazy about Windows 8 stem from the fact that it's easier to use Windows 8 on a tablet than a desktop PC.&nbsp; I'll provide a couple of specific examples.</p><p>While re-installing some of the software I mentioned above that needed updates, I was told that I would need to restart my system.&nbsp; I'm used to this, and that's ok.&nbsp; But I wanted to install/configure a bunch of stuff before restarting so that I could minimize the number of restarts I would need to experience.&nbsp; So when the installer for those programs asked me to restart, I said "no".&nbsp; When I was done with my configuration, I looked for the restart option in the Windows 8 UI...&nbsp; and couldn't find it.</p><p>I've been using Windows PCs for, well, a long time.&nbsp; I had to open the help application to learn how to turn the computer off.&nbsp; To me, this seems wrong.&nbsp; Granted, with Windows 8, I shouldn't have to do this very often.&nbsp; And maybe my power button can do it.&nbsp; But having been trained for years to use the UI to perform resets and not being able to find it, that seems like a UX failure to me.&nbsp; And that's just one of many.</p><p>The reset functionality is tucked into these new "Charms".&nbsp; Charms easily display when you have a tablet by "swiping" in from the right edge of the screen.&nbsp; You can't do this on a desktop with no touchscreen.&nbsp; Instead, you can put your mouse in a little hotspot in the bottom right corner of the monitor.&nbsp; And wait.</p><p>So, I have four monitors.&nbsp; Where do I put my mouse?&nbsp; As it turns out, I can do it on any monitor, and the charms appear on <i>that</i>&nbsp;monitor.&nbsp; This is weird to me.&nbsp; It's also strange that if I start a metro-style app that runs full-screen, it runs only on that monitor, and <i>closes</i>&nbsp;any other monitor that has a full-screen app on it.&nbsp; For example, I can't run the mail app on one screen and the photos app on another at the same time.</p><p>Also, in many of these corner-idling gestures (the Charms are not the only one), the mouse sticks to the corner.&nbsp; As a result, I can no longer push the mouse up from the top left corner of my center screen into the monitor above it.&nbsp; Likewise, I can't pull the mouse down through the bottom left corner of the top monitor.&nbsp; It's trapped my mouse, which is a nitpick, but something that affects me more often than you might expect.</p><p>There are keyboard shortcuts for all of the tablet gestures that feel really klunky.&nbsp; The swipe gesture seems pretty natural if you're using a tablet.&nbsp; But the Win+C keypress is an unnatural substitute, and I feel like the idling of the mouse in the corner is a UX cop-out.</p><p><b>I have some video issues.</b>&nbsp; As with any initial release, there are bound to be some little annoyances that will likely be fixed eventually.&nbsp; My primary problem of concern at the moment is with my top monitor.&nbsp; I used to have Catalyst Control Center available to correct the underscan of my video card to this monitor.&nbsp; The program would allow me to remove the inch of black border from that monitor due to an inexplicable/inexcusable default setting on ATI's part.&nbsp; But I can no longer run Catalyst Control Center on Windows 8.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the reason is, but the existing software (which was not marked as incompatible) will no longer run.&nbsp; Instead, it shows an error message about having no settings to control.&nbsp; Without this software, I can't remove the underscan, and my top monitor's video is fuzzy.&nbsp; </p><p>I have tried all of the registry settings I've seen online, rebooted ad nauseum (after I learned how), tried re-installing Catalyst to no avail.&nbsp; And I'm reluctant to mess around too much with it because otherwise my video is <i>so</i>&nbsp;much better than it was under Windows 7, I'm almost willing to live with the issue.&nbsp; Almost.</p><p>Suffice to say that I don't think this is a Windows 8 issue per se, but rather a problem of the ATI software which is generally crap and has caused me limitless frustration in the past.&nbsp; ATI/AMD can accept the blame for this, for sure.</p><p><b>The mouse wheel doesn't work on the scrollbars in full-screen apps or certain elements of Windows 8 itself, like t</b><b>he charms flyout.</b>&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; No idea.&nbsp; It's stupid.</p><p><b>Smartglass is a big tease.</b>&nbsp; Every time the kids have turned on the XBox this week, I've seen a notice telling me to join their experience.&nbsp; I keep thinking it would be great if I could pull down a monitor-full of Minecraft being run on the console and play along with them.&nbsp; Alas, I can't do that.&nbsp; I've seen some of the stuff online for what Smartglass can do with the XBox, but I can't imagine any of that would be useful on my desktop, which is nowhere near the Xbox in the family room.&nbsp; Maybe some of the video/audio features will be useful in the future.&nbsp; I'll have to look into it some more.</p><p><b>The app store is kind of "meh".</b>&nbsp; It's nice that Microsoft has integrated a store into their OS.&nbsp; It makes app discovery and acquisition easier and central.&nbsp; I hope that they're able to work out the problem with Valve over Steam and get some real games into the app store.&nbsp; The experience in the Windows 8 store is visually cleaner than Steam with all its stats cruft.&nbsp; That said, sifting through the app store for an app seems like a pointless endeavor.&nbsp; There are so many apps, each described only with an icon and a name, it's impossible to tell which does what usefully without going into each.&nbsp; This kind of defeats the purpose, I think.&nbsp; I expect they'll do something to improve this experience, but I've been let down before.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I haven't fully explored the OS and all of the features.&nbsp; For example, there are sharing features that I haven't even touched, primarily because I can't figure out what apps might use them and what they'll do.&nbsp; The social features are interesting, but not (yet?) as good as the apps I already use, though I'll keep an eye on them.</p><p>The bottom line for me is that the system is running more smoothly.&nbsp; It feels more lithe.&nbsp; The UI "quirks" are a serious problem, and I'm hoping to correct them with some hardware.&nbsp; (Am I the only one who is <b>utterly shocked</b> at the lack of 3rd-party touchscreen addons for Windows 8 desktops?)</p><p>For the money, I think Windows 8 has a fair price for the improvements I've seen.&nbsp; As the kinks are smoothed out with updates and new apps start to take advantage of Windows 8's new features, I think the benefits of the upgrade will become more apparent.</p>	</div>
