Computer nerd, and occasionally very intense dabbler.
Used computers since 1985, so LOTS and LOTS of background.
Sometimes I favorite horrible things, because like zombies, they're funny to look at and make fun of.

What Windows-related files are valueless to *nix users?

What Windows-related files are valueless to *nix users?
Do you have a recommended find command for doing this? What I've found that seems to maybe be a good start is find . -type f -mtime +572w -exec ls -l {} \; looking through the output and possibly dialing-in the target cutoff time, and then using -delete instead of the -exec to mass delete the unwanteds. Followed up with a find . -empty -delete to rub out empty directories and files. Then using selective filename/extension scrubbing. Any better ideas?

pagefile was one of the first targets. The windows directory is often a good target, unless users used it to hide files in... which is sometimes a case, and can't be discounted. Fonts are a good target for saving, but might be license-encumbered.

This seems to be the base of a good idea. Most of the OS files retain their modify/creation date from when they were first stored to CD or packed into an upgrade archive.

Why can an unpriviliged user execute the `sync` command?
@jippie Additionally: Microsoft skipping the inclusion of a necessary function is... nothing new, and not surprising.

@jippie I think you're missing the point. All sync ever does is commit (immediately) to disk things that were going to have to be committed anyway. When I go to remove a flash drive, I want to make sure that everything I wrote to it actually got written. And, while umount is supposed to guarantee this, I'm not assured, so I want (as a user) to make sure before I yank it. There is NO HARM WHATSOEVER in forcing the system to flush buffers to disk. At worst, some things are lagged for a second while the system actively flushes the buffers. The hazard would be in denying users this function.

FreeNAS versus a regular (CentOS/Ubuntu) linux server?
FreeNAS8 is a commercial project designed for the purpose of selling hardware. They abandoned a lot of the good design decisions of FreeNAS7 series. That with the inflated system "requirements" (because they're trying to sell more or more expensive hardware) makes FreeNAS8 very suspect.

With the introduction of NAS4Free (the true heir of FreeNAS), the increase in FreeBSD version have pulled in the v28 pool format, with all the toys/tools. NAS4Free makes a great OS, be it for a "simple" NAS or scaled up to a server.

@MichaelMrozek I appreciate the asking. Would they be upset if I cross-posted it anyway? Or would that just upset things? Or would it (possibly additionally) get flagged/closed as not-on-topic and/or not-a-good-fit?

Is it possible some intrepid person (or plural) has sat down and created published versions of vmlist for Win95 to current (maybe able to stop at WinXP, not sure...)?

filesystem for archiving
The use of deduplication is both memory expensive (with probability of bad side-effects if memory ends up running out, which happens more often then you might imagine), but also is only really helpful in certain (probably corporate) use cases. Use of ZFS snapshots would work though.

What Windows-related files are valueless to *nix users?
While this shows good finesse in "removing windows from archives", it would be impractical (at best) in this case, since some of these are more than a decade old, and the version of windows used would be difficult to determine, if available at all. Finesse would be nice, if it were possible, but I think that as I go through these, it will be brute force that ends up ruling the day(s).

Having not used windows in quite some time, I'm not up on knowing what directories are valueless, and further, having used non-standard directories for storing things, like putting files in Program Files, or hidden in the Windows directory, I don't discount those as places where gems may be hiding. I know some files generally have more innate value than others, which is why I'm trying to approach this from the "long way around".
