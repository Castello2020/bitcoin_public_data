<p style="color: #000000;">“Gaping holes exist in the scientific understanding of existence, which the sciences answer chiefly be ignoring them. They do not mention purpose (there is none), the possibility of an afterlife (there is none), free will or determinism (we have freely determined that there is no free will), or Good and Evil (evolutionary traits evolved to further cohesion within the pack). Minor omissions, these.” Fred Reed, “<a href="http://fredoneverything.net/PondScum.shtml" target="_blank">Pond Scum</a>”</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Reed, like all secular humanists, is appalled that he cannot inject meaning unto creation.  Since it has become second nature with Fred to view the world as if he is the determiner Fred ends in despair.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Yes, the universe has its appeal. I have never lived in a place more eerily beautiful and complexly implausible. Perhaps we really are just pond scum on a minor planet in the middle of everywhere. Or maybe something is going on that is way above our pay grade. But between the sciences that describe much and explain nothing, and religious faiths that seem exercises in wish fulfillment…” Fred Reed, “<a href="http://fredoneverything.net/PondScum.shtml" target="_blank">Pond Scum</a>”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Being the “determiner” is an untenable position.  Determiners attempt to understand the universe from God’s perspective.  It cannot be done.  Man was created in God’s image but the creature cannot become the creator; that is the original sin, man attempting to be like God.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">No human being can unravel the complex implausibility of our existence in this universe because we did not create it.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Rousas Rushdoony is singularly remarkable because he read, understood, remembered and refuted the “determiner” philosophies of not one but all of the significant popular secular philosophers. His grasp of the nuances of scores of different thinkers and writers is astounding.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Rushdoony writes, “For man to define God would mean that man would then classify God in relationship to himself and would understand and judge God, as well as to name Him, in terms of man’s infallible word.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Fred Reed often mentions the role of high intellect in society.  He is a thinker who often strays from politically correct maxims.  His columns contain interesting and esoteric words that I regularly look up in the dictionary. He is accomplished in the fields of mathematics and science and uses examples in his writing.  His columns evoke a high respect for intellectual brilliance – his and others.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A photographic memory coupled with a brilliant mind can produce an outstanding individual in both the secular and Christian world.  Rushdoony had both.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The problem that afflicts our world is not a lack of brilliant minds but a lack of the humility that makes a brilliant mind useful. Reed recognizes this arrogance when he writes, “To me the most tedious thing about atheists is how proud they are of themselves..”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Before beginning to reason on the human plight the thinker must consider how his mind and his person relate to his environment.  His I.Q. may be at the apogee of the Mensa club and his reasoning may be crystal clear but if he starts from the wrong premise all of his work will be faulty.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He must acknowledge that there is a larger universe beyond the range of our most powerful telescopes.  We know it is there and that what we know of it dwarfs not only us as human beings but also our planet and solar system.  To further complicate our quest for verity there is an infinitesimal universe so tiny our telescopes cannot make it visible.  We, ourselves, live in a milieu, in some ways similar to an ant hill.  We are one in millions of others all made from the same last and all functioning in a similar manner.  To think realistically the thinker must consider his plight.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The next logical consideration should be the world in which we live.  As we have already concluded, there is much we cannot understand.  However, we can discern that the multeity is sometimes chaotic and sometimes orderly.  It is sometimes beautiful and sometimes ugly, it challenges our mind, resists our physique, but quenches our hunger and thirst.  It is reasonable and much of it is understandable.  It is, however, a creation that is beyond the comprehension of the human mind.  Man could never create such an array and the stubborn stupidity that lies behind the ridiculous assumption that in millions of years a system of evolution could defy the <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-thermodynamics.html" target="_blank">Second Law of Thermodynamics</a> and bring about this brilliant complexity should strain the logic of any  clear thinking seeker.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As insignificant as we are we can easily understand that the order and design of the world is compatible with our understanding. We are creatures of the creation and we are intrinsically related to it.  Attempts to understand the environment and find meaning and direction must begin by seeking to know the Creator.  We are created beings.  Theories that deny creation are not plausible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">We are prisoners in a physical body and in a created world.  Life itself requires restrictions to provide us with food and water.  Freedom is a quantitative concept and the Creator has provided us with Law designed to provide us with justice and peace without which freedom is impossible</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">We can yell and scream and protest with the intellects of our most brilliant counterparts but it is all for naught.  When we succumb to the disastrous conclusion that we are sovereign and the arbiters of our behavior we always end in murder and mayhem.  We were not created to govern ourselves and our efforts to do so are and have been disastrous.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Fred writes, “Of course if you want to be convinced earnestly enough, you can believe anything.”  Humans are gullible and as we watch our nation sink into the mire we are witnessing first-hand the depth of our gullibility.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The God of the Bible, the One True God, selects His servants.  The desire to understand comes into the heart of a seeker through the Holy Spirit.  Contrary to the current pop-theology of our churches, we do not do the “inviting”.  God is sovereign, He does the inviting.  When we are invited He gives us the humility to seek Him as servants and when we seek Him from that perspective He rescues us and makes us His own.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Humanists have a penchant for discussing “most religions”. They choke by trying to swallow the entire box of chocolates in one bit.  We live in a nation that is primarily populated by people who consider themselves Christian.  But because the One True God and His Word, the Bible, have been badly distorted and the distortion has been accepted by gullible Christians the nation does not reflect the pristine society God desires.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">We worship a God Who champions life.  His original creation was designed to support life but His intent was disrupted when His created beings challenged His rule.  Adam was not created as a god and when he was seduced into acting like a god, murder, mayhem, death and disease came into the world.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Rushdoony writes, “But man is a creature, and his freedom is a creaturely and limited freedom.  Man does not choose his own nature, time and place of birth, sex, aptitudes, or anything else in this direction.  Because he is a creature, not God, and not the first cause, man’s freedom is limited, derivative, and secondary freedom.  Man’s freedom is the freedom to be the man God created him to be, not the freedom to be a god” Pg. 75 “Systematic Theology”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Eleventh Chapter of the Book of Isaiah describes God’s desire for His creation “Also righteousness will be the belt about His loins, And faithfulness the belt about His waist. And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will lie down with the young goat, And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; And a little boy will lead them. Also the cow and the bear will graze, Their young will lie down together, And the lion will eat straw like the ox.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He has given us His Law and instructed us to obey.  In return He will give us life more abundantly.  When we disobey we create discord; when we obey we create justice and peace.  It is the assigned duty of every Christian to work at bringing the creation under the control of God’s Law.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Human beings are created in the image of God.  They are not gods but created beings.  They are unable to penetrate the mind of God.  His creation is far beyond the capability of their thought and logic.   We are made to obey our Creator and the sickness, suffering, murder, and mayhem that are both antediluvian and current are a result of our refusal to do so</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">If Fred is to make progress in understanding the world he must begin as a creature with a willingness to seek the Creator.  God has granted us dominion over the creation but not over Himself.  Our dominion over His creation is to be governed by His Law and His Law is immutable.</p>

<p>&#8220;An ecosystem, you can always intervene and change something in it, but there&#8217;s no way of knowing what all the downstream effects will be or how it might affect the environment. We have such a miserably poor understanding of how the organism develops from its DNA that I would be surprised if we don&#8217;t get one rude shock after another.&#8221; Professor Richard Lewontin, Professor of Genetics, Harvard University</p>
<p>Specific plants evolve with DNA to withstand drought, rainforest conditions, severe temperatures and different soils.  A cactus thrives in the desert, but would die in a rainforest.  A tropical fern expands in the rainforest, but dies in a desert. Each plant’s DNA evolved to allow it to grow within a specific eco-system.</p>
<p>When GMO plants grow within a specific eco-system, their DNA bastardizes the normal DNA of native plants.  Specific genes mutate and become “Frankensteinized” by the genetically manipulated plants.   Thus, we human alter the Natural World via the planet.  We change the way bees operate or cannot operate with a GMO plant.  Whereby a ladybug thrived, it now dies.  What proliferated on ladybugs dies without their specific food source—and on down the line.</p>
<p>Carey Biron at Inter Press Service said, “A third of U.S. organic farmers have experienced problems in their fields due to the nearby use of genetically modified crops, and over half of those growers have had loads of grain rejected because of unwitting GMO contamination.</p>
<p>“Of U.S. farmers that took part in a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodandwaterwatch.org%2Fbriefs%2Forganic-farmers-pay-the-price-for-contamination%2F&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNGSfQ_dn9ptoVDFF8FSQL2zxf8c5w">new survey</a>, the results of which were released on Monday, more than 80 percent reported being concerned over the impact of genetically modified (GM) crops on their farms, with some 60 percent saying they’re “very concerned.””</p>
<p>&#8220;USDA has been extremely lax and, in our opinion, that’s due to the excessive influence of the biotech industry in political circles.” &#8212; Organic farmer Oren Holle</p>
<p>Again, we see ground level folks pointing fingers at our Congressional critters in Washington, DC.  Money flat-out buys their votes to stop any GMO labeling or discussion.</p>
<p> “The USDA said they didn’t have this data, but all they had to do was ask,” Oren Holle, a farmer in the Midwestern state of Kansas and president of the Organic Farmers’ Agency for Relationship Marketing (OFARM), which assisted in the new study’s production.   “Our very strong feeling is that the introduction and propagation of the genetically modified products that are coming out under patent at this point have not had the regulatory oversight that they should have, and need to involve a far broader section of stakeholders. USDA has been extremely lax and, in our opinion, that’s due to the excessive influence of the biotech industry in political circles.”</p>
<p><strong>Misplaced Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>While just one percent of corn and seven percent of soybeans grown in the U.S. came from GM seeds during the mid-1990s, by last year both of those numbers had risen to above 90 percent.</p>
<p>Biron said, “In the new study, nearly half of the farmers polled said they did not believe that GM and non-GM crops could ever “coexist”, while more than two-thirds said that “good stewardship” is insufficient to address contamination.”</p>
<p>“The USDA’s focus on coexistence and crop insurance is misplaced,” Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food &#038; Water Watch, said Monday, referring to an AC21 recommendation that GM contamination problems be dealt with through a federal insurance scheme set up to lessen the impact of natural disasters.</p>
<p>“The department must recognize the harm that is already being done to organic and non-GMO farmers and put the responsibility squarely where it belongs – with the biotech companies … Now USDA can no longer claim ignorance about this problem.”</p>
<p><strong>Old Playbook</strong></p>
<p>“There’s been a lot of new technology introduced in agriculture over the past 50 years. But there’s always been a point of law that, whatever happens on my side of the fence, I’m still responsible for how it might affect my neighbor,” Holle notes. “GMOs take away that neighbor-to-neighbor relationship, however, as the ways in which unintended presence occurs is a completely different set of concerns from other new technologies. For that reason, they need a completely different set of rules.”</p>
<p>Enormous money to be made by biotech companies at our expense</p>
<p>“At least 35 other species of genetically engineered fish are currently under development,” Friends of the Earth, an advocacy group, stated Monday. The “decision on this genetically engineered salmon application will set a precedent for other genetically engineered fish and animals … to enter the global food market.”</p>

<p>“The introduction of genetically modified foods (GMO) tampers with the essence of life in an experiment with an unknown outcome and no real way to undue the damage. The FDA purposely does not require labeling of GMO food, since no one who understands the issue would ever purchase it. This makes it all the more difficult to locate healthful food.”  Byron J. Richards, <em>The Leptin Diet: How Fit Is Your Fat?</em></p>
<p>This series exposes the outright fraud against peoples’ lives and the contempt for American citizens (and citizens of the world who eat our grains) with the injection of Genetically Modified Organism foods by the highest representatives in our U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Call it a “financial cartel” that allows GMOs to be fed to our citizenry, but worse, for the love of money, those power elites accelerate the destruction of our Natural World.</p>
<p>We humans grow too clever and too arrogant to understand the long-term penalties we heap on Mother Nature until she finds no other answers but to claw back at us, i.e., cancers, disease and more aberrant environmental disasters to come.</p>
<p>Every crop in America, Canada, Australia and much of the third world where GMO advocates like ADM and Monsanto can force their “Frankensteinization” on farmers—they push it.</p>
<p>Even with all the evidence piling up, those same elites hammer any opposition into the ground.  They “bribe” the FDA officials to not label any GMO foods so you don’t know what you’re eating.</p>
<p>We destroy our own bodies by our actions, but we also obliterate the Natural World and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Today around the world, trillions of bees suffer “colony collapse” via GMO crops.  Nature cannot figure out how to deal with plants that suffer genetic modification or DNA change-ups.</p>
<p>GMO foods represent a pitcher throwing an orange to the catcher in a Major League Baseball game.  Within several pitches, the orange wouldn’t hold its form from the violent treatment.  If the batter connected with the orange, it would splatter all over the field.  Result: the game couldn’t continue.  The players could not play and the spectators would go home.</p>
<p>But in GMO production, the consequences cannot be seen as quickly, however those “errors” against Mother Nature will surface well into the future.</p>
<p>Ethan Huff, science writer for Natural News said,  “A pair of studies recently published in the journal <em>Science</em> raises dire warnings about the continued decline of crop-pollinating insects all over the world, and what this means for the future of the world&#8217;s food supply. Both studies highlight the fact that wild pollinators like bumblebees, butterflies, and beetles are basically disappearing, and that industrial agriculture, which includes genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), are a major factor causing this insect genocide.</p>
<p>“At least half a dozen other studies published in the last couple of years have arrived at similarly disturbing findings. They do, however, shed further light on how the situation has progressed throughout the decades, pointing to corporate monoculture practices, shrinking forests and wild lands, and general changes in physical landscapes as some of the primary culprits in promoting this ruinous trend.”</p>
<p>We not only change the DNA of our fellow planetary travelers, but we destroy their habitat.  We seem to think no consequences will befall us.</p>
<p>“The earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.”<br />

<p>Last week, I interviewed with Ross Kaminsky at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.KOA.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEz2i_chUh63_gvBb066sf_KFNXUw">www.KOA.com</a> in Denver, Colorado. Mind you, this young man, about 30, sounded brilliant and highly articulate.  I liked him.   I spoke about America adding 100 million immigrants and a total of 138 million people by 2050—a scant 36 years from now.  I brought facts and compelling information to the show.  I attempted to show him and the public the ramifications of adding 138 million people—and that, we could not sustain such numbers and our environment.</p>
<p>He sat across from me saying, “We don’t have a population problem. We have plenty of water and oil.  The oceans can absorb all our carbon footprint.”</p>
<p>I said, “You’re speaking with assumptions as if they were facts.  You make statements based on belief where I make them based on facts from my research.”</p>
<p>He dumbfounded me with his arrogance that we can keep adding endless people with no consequences. He wanted everyone to live a free life.  I countered with the fact that as our population numbers rise, our freedoms decline along with balance in our Natural World.  That fact cannot be disputed.</p>
<p>I explained how our oceans suffer acidification and that reefs die with carbon footprint and how marine life cannot endure the onslaught.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t hear of it.  Mind you, this young man, traveled on six continents like I have traveled.  He lives in denial and defends it. Along with him, the majority of the American public feels the same.</p>
<p>We see the same denial with our leaders who advocate for GMOs in plants and fish—in the face of facts.</p>
<p>“In one of the studies, researchers from <em>Montana State University</em> (MSU) compared insect data collected in the late 1800s to similar data collected in the same test location in the 1970s,” said Huff. “They then compiled current data from the same area to compare to both of these other two data sets, upon which they discovered that the number of unique wild bee species had dropped by nearly half.</p>
<p>“What is perhaps more disturbing, however, is the fact that researchers observed modern bees to be generally interacting less with plants than they used to in previous generations. According to the data, the overall number of interactions between bees and plants has also dropped by roughly half, indicating a serious problem as far as the general <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2Ffood_supply.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4mPP83RjMBjk_230oZRJFYnflhA">food supply</a> is concerned, as about 75 percent of global food crops rely on pollination by animals.”</p>
<p><strong>Managed honeybees do not pollinate crops as well as wild honeybees</strong></p>
<p>The second study troubles me further:  having found that pollinating insects in general, which include a wide range of insects and other animals, continue vanishing from their normal habitats and foraging areas.</p>
<p>“Based on field trials conducted in 20 different countries, wild insects are clearly on the decline everywhere, and managed honeybee colonies established to replace them in many areas are failing to pick up where the wild honeybees left off,” said Huff.</p>
<p>&#8220;In landscapes with lower diversity and lower abundance of wild insects, the crops had less fruits,&#8221; explains Lucas Garibaldi, author of the second study. &#8220;Wild insects pollinated way more efficiently: Flowers produced twice as many fruits after being visited by wild insects and were more consistent in their production than when visited by honeybees.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Some “leaders” blame climate destabilization and other outside factors for this mysterious decline in crop <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2Fpollinators.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7QB9M6W9HC4ENdn_Etrj6rXCH5Q">pollinators</a>,” said Huff. “But the major elephant in the room, and the one that <strong>the mainstream media</strong> is desperately trying to avoid, <strong>is GMOs</strong> and the chemical-based technologies used to grow them. As we have covered time and time again, neonicotinoids and other pesticide and herbicide products are responsible for weakening and killing off bees and other crop pollinators, particularly in North America where <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2FGMOs.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJczbJwcmhfHBCICAjt77fXGwRqQ">GMOs</a> are most widely cultivated.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The proof is obvious that one of the major reasons of the bees&#8217; decline is by the ingestion of GMO proteins,&#8221; explains a report by Brit Amos from <em>Global Research</em> about the decline of bee colonies. &#8220;The truth is that organic farming is relatively untouched as the bee crisis is concerned. Organic farming maintains the diversity of the eco-system and preserves the quality of the foods produced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more I research into what we and our children face with our “disfiguring” the Natural World with our poisons and GMO assault, the more sickened I am in my mind and heart.  Since I lack any power or influence, someone like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet needs to fund campaigns to stop GMO production.  After all, it’s their kids, too, who must live in this world.</p>
<p>All of this GMO nightmare stems from too many people needing food for survival with too many elites willing to sacrifice the Natural World in order to make endless billions of dollars to live in big homes, drive expensive cars and fly Lear Jets.<br />

<p style="color: #222222;">So, what do we have here? In Libya, in Syria, and elsewhere the United States has been on the same side as the al-Qaeda types. But not in Ukraine. That’s the good news. The bad news is that in Ukraine the United States is on the same side as the neo-Nazi types, who – taking time off from parading around with their swastika-like symbols and calling for the death of Jews, Russians and Communists – on May 2 burned down a trade-union building in Odessa, killing scores of people and sending hundreds to hospital; many of the victims were beaten or shot when they tried to flee the flames and smoke; ambulances were blocked from reaching the wounded. Try and find an American mainstream media entity that has made a serious attempt to capture the horror.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And how did this latest example of American foreign-policy exceptionalism come to be? One starting point that can be considered is what former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Robert Gates says in his recently published memoir: “When the Soviet Union was collapsing in late 1991, [Defense Secretary Dick Cheney] wanted to see the dismemberment not only of the Soviet Union and the Russian empire but of Russia itself, so it could never again be a threat to the rest of the world.” That can serve as an early marker for the new cold war while the corpse of the old one was still warm. Soon thereafter, NATO began to surround Russia with military bases, missile sites, and NATO members, while yearning for perhaps the most important part needed to complete the circle – Ukraine.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In February of this year, US State Department officials, undiplomatically, joined anti-government protesters in the capital city of Kiev, handing out encouragement and food, from which emanated the infamous leaked audio tape between the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, and the State Department’s Victoria Nuland, former US ambassador to NATO and former State Department spokesperson for Hillary Clinton. Their conversation dealt with who should be running the new Ukraine government after the government of Viktor Yanukovich was overthrown; their most favored for this position being one Arseniy Yatsenuk.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">My dear, and recently departed, Washington friend, John Judge, liked to say that if you want to call him a “conspiracy theorist” you have to call others “coincidence theorists”. Thus it was by the most remarkable of coincidences that Arseniy Yatsenuk did indeed become the new prime minister. He could very soon be found in private meetings and public press conferences with the president of the United States and the Secretary-General of NATO, as well as meeting with the soon-to-be new owners of Ukraine, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, preparing to impose their standard financial shock therapy. The current protestors in Ukraine don’t need PHDs in economics to know what this portends. They know about the impoverishment of Greece, Spain, <em>et al</em>. They also despise the new regime for its overthrow of their democratically-elected government, whatever its shortcomings. But the American media obscures these motivations by almost always referring to them simply as “pro-Russian”.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">An exception, albeit rather unemphasized, was the April 17 <em>Washington Post</em> which reported from Donetsk that many of the eastern Ukrainians whom the author interviewed said the unrest in their region was driven by fear of “economic hardship” and the IMF austerity plan that will make their lives even harder: “At a most dangerous and delicate time, just as it battles Moscow for hearts and minds across the east, the pro-Western government is set to initiate a shock therapy of economic measures to meet the demands of an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Arseniy Yatsenuk, it should be noted, has something called the Arseniy Yatsenuk Foundation. If you go to the <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #02588d;" href="http://openukraine.org/en/about/partners" target="_blank">foundation’s website</a> you will see the logos of the foundation’s “partners”.  Among these partners we find NATO, the National Endowment for Democracy, the US State Department, Chatham House (Royal Institute of International Affairs in the UK), the German Marshall Fund (a think tank founded by the German government in honor of the US Marshall Plan), as well as a couple of international banks. Is any comment needed?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Getting away with supporting al-Qaeda and Nazi types may be giving US officials the idea that they can say or do anything they want in their foreign policy. In a May 2 press conference, President Obama, referring to Ukraine and the NATO Treaty, said: “We’re united in our unwavering Article 5 commitment to the security of our NATO allies”. (Article 5 states: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all.”) Did the president forget that Ukraine is not (yet) a member of NATO? And in the same press conference, the president referred to the “duly elected government in Kyiv (Kiev)”, when in fact it had come to power via a coup and then proceeded to establish a new regime in which the vice-premier, minister of defense, minister of agriculture, and minister of environment, all belonged to far-right neo-Nazi parties.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The pure awfulness of the Ukrainian right-wingers can scarcely be exaggerated. In early March, the leader of Pravy Sektor (Right Sector) called upon his comrades, the infamous Chechnyan terrorists, to carry out further terrorist actions in Russia.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">There may be one important difference between the old Cold War and the new one. The American people, as well as the world, can not be as easily brainwashed as they were during the earlier period.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Over the course of a decade, in doing the research for my first books and articles on US foreign policy, one of the oddities to me of the Cold War was how often the Soviet Union seemed to know what the United States was really up to, even if the American people didn’t. Every once in a while in the 1950s to 70s a careful reader would notice a two- or three-inch story in the <em>New York Times</em> on the bottom of some distant inside page, reporting that <em>Pravda</em> or <em>Izvestia</em> had claimed that a recent coup or political assassination in Africa or Asia or Latin America had been the work of the CIA; the<em>Times</em> might add that a US State Department official had labeled the story as “absurd”. And that was that; no further details were provided; and none were needed, for how many American readers gave it a second thought? It was just more commie propaganda. Who did they think they were fooling? This ignorance/complicity on the part of the mainstream media allowed the United States to get away with all manner of international crimes and mischief.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It was only in the 1980s when I began to do the serious research that resulted in my first book, which later became <em>Killing Hope</em>, that I was able to fill in the details and realize that the United States had indeed masterminded that particular coup or assassination, and many other coups and assassinations, not to mention countless bombings, chemical and biological warfare, perversion of elections, drug dealings, kidnapings, and much more that had not appeared in the American mainstream media or schoolbooks. (And a significant portion of which was apparently unknown to the Soviets as well.)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But there have been countless revelations about US crimes in the past two decades. Many Americans and much of the rest of the planet have become educated. They’re much more skeptical of American proclamations and the fawning media.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">President Obama recently declared: “The strong condemnation that it’s received from around the world indicates the degree to which Russia is on the wrong side of history on this.”  Marvelous … coming from the man who partners with jihadists and Nazis and has waged war against seven nations. In the past half century is there any country whose foreign policy has received more bitter condemnation than the United States? If the United States is not on the wrong side of history, it may be only in the history books published by the United States.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Barack Obama, like virtually all Americans, likely believes that the Soviet Union, with perhaps the sole exception of the Second World War, was consistently on the wrong side of history in its foreign policy as well as at home. Yet, in a survey conducted by an independent Russian polling center this past January, and reported in the <em>Washington Post</em> in April, 86 percent of respondents older than 55 expressed regret for the Soviet Union’s collapse; 37 percent of those aged 25 to 39 did so. (Similar poll results have been reported regularly since the demise of the Soviet Union. This is from<em>USA Today</em> in 1999: “When the Berlin Wall crumbled, East Germans imagined a life of freedom where consumer goods were abundant and hardships would fade. Ten years later, a remarkable 51% say they were happier with communism.”)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Or as the new Russian proverb put it: “Everything the Communists said about Communism was a lie, but everything they said about capitalism turned out to be the truth.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">A week before the above <em>Post</em> report in April the newspaper printed an article about happiness around the world, which contains the following charming lines: “Worldwide polls show that life seems better to older people – except in Russia.” … “Essentially, life under President Vladimir Putin is one continuous downward spiral into despair.” … “What’s going on in Russia is deep unhappiness.” … “In Russia, the only thing to look forward to is death’s sweet embrace.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">No, I don’t think it was meant to be any kind of satire. It appears to be a scientific study, complete with graphs, but it reads like something straight out of the 1950s.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The views Americans hold of themselves and other societies are not necessarily more distorted than the views found amongst people elsewhere in the world, but the Americans’ distortion can lead to much more harm. Most Americans and members of Congress have convinced themselves that the US/NATO encirclement of Russia is benign – we are, after all, the Good Guys – and they don’t understand why Russia can’t see this.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The first Cold War, from Washington’s point of view, was often designated as one of “containment”, referring to the US policy of preventing the spread of communism around the world, trying to block<em>the very idea</em> of communism or socialism. There’s still some leftover from that – see Venezuela and Cuba, for example – but the new Cold War can be seen more in terms of a military strategy. Washington thinks in terms of who could pose a barrier to the ever-expanding empire adding to its bases and other military necessities.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Whatever the rationale, it’s imperative that the United States suppress any lingering desire to bring Ukraine (and Georgia) into the NATO alliance. Nothing is more likely to bring large numbers of Russian boots onto the Ukrainian ground than the idea that Washington wants to have NATO troops right on the Russian border and in spitting distance of the country’s historic Black Sea naval base in Crimea.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">The myth of Soviet expansionism</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">One still comes across references in the mainstream media to Russian “expansionism” and “the Soviet empire”, in addition to that old favorite “the evil empire”. These terms stem largely from erstwhile Soviet control of Eastern European states. But was the creation of these satellites following World War II an act of imperialism or expansionism? Or did the decisive impetus lie elsewhere?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Within the space of less than 25 years, Western powers had invaded Russia three times – the two world wars and the “Intervention” of 1918-20 – inflicting some 40 million casualties in the two wars alone. To carry out these invasions, the West had used Eastern Europe as a highway. Should it be any cause for wonder that after World War II the Soviets wanted to close this highway down? In almost any other context, Americans would have no problem in seeing this as an act of self defense. But in the context of the Cold War such thinking could not find a home in mainstream discourse.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The Baltic states of the Soviet Union – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – were not part of the highway and were frequently in the news because of their demands for more autonomy from Moscow, a story “natural” for the American media. These articles invariably reminded the reader that the “once independent” Baltic states were invaded in 1939 by the Soviet Union, incorporated as republics of the USSR, and had been “occupied” ever since. Another case of brutal Russian imperialism. Period. History etched in stone.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The three countries, it happens, were part of the Russian empire from 1721 up to the Russian Revolution of 1917, in the midst of World War I. When the war ended in November 1918, and the Germans had been defeated, the victorious Allied nations (US, Great Britain, France, <em>et al.</em>) permitted/encouraged the German forces to remain in the Baltics for a full year to crush the spread of Bolshevism there; this, with ample military assistance from the Allied nations. In each of the three republics, the Germans installed collaborators in power who declared their independence from the new Bolshevik state which, by this time, was so devastated by the World War, the revolution, and the civil war prolonged by the Allies’ intervention, that it had no choice but to accept the <em>fait accompli</em>. The rest of the fledgling Soviet Union had to be saved.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">To at least win some propaganda points from this unfortunate state of affairs, the Soviets announced that they were relinquishing the Baltic republics “voluntarily” in line with their principles of anti-imperialism and self-determination. But is should not be surprising that the Soviets continued to regard the Baltics as a rightful part of their nation or that they waited until they were powerful enough to reclaim the territory.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Then we had Afghanistan. Surely this was an imperialist grab. But the Soviet Union had lived next door to Afghanistan for more than 60 years without gobbling it up. And when the Russians invaded in 1979, the key motivation was the United States involvement in a movement, largely Islamic, to topple the Afghan government, which was friendly to Moscow. The Soviets could not have been expected to tolerate a pro-US, anti-communist government on its border any more than the United States could have been expected to tolerate a pro-Soviet, communist government in Mexico.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, if the rebel movement took power it likely would have set up a fundamentalist Islamic government, which would have been in a position to proselytize the numerous Muslims in the Soviet border republics.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<em>The attack on biblical creation in UK schools continues</em>,&#8221; Phil Robinson reports that in the dechristianized U.K. unrelenting attacks against special creation (Genesis account) display a level of aggressive intolerance that is hard to stomach, coming as they do from self-proclaimed scientifically-enlightened ‘voices of reason.’  Some schools have already banned the teaching of special creation in favor of evolutionary science.   (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>, Mar. 9, 2014)</p>
<p>Other shrill &#8216;voices of reason&#8217; go so far as to connect special creation to mental illness and child abuse. During a radio interview in Australia famous physicist and atheist propagandist Lawrence Krauss said that while in the United States recently, he stated that &#8220;<em>teaching creationism is child abuse and I think it is.&#8221; </em>(Prayer News, a publication of Creation Ministries, Apr. 2014)</p>
<p>Throughout the West and here in America a slash-and-burn operation conducted against the Genesis account, particularly its&#8217; literal and historical elements, is justified by the false idea that evolution is science, thus intolerance of special creation is often presented as a ‘science versus religion’ or ‘faith versus reason’ issue.   So successful has this war of attrition been that younger generations of Westerners and Americans have been disconnected from both Western history and its’ founding Christian-based worldview, thus like seedlings recently popped up from the soil are unconcerned that special creation, where the ultimate source of life, being and unalienable rights are found, has nearly been displaced by anti-human pagan conceptions positing billions of years of evolutionary transformism from lower kinds of things to higher and higher kinds of things&#8212; even non-human kinds of things:</p>
<p><em>“For us, the best way to create new (‘artificial’) life forms and intelligence is to allow them to emerge through evolution, as nature does, only in much shorter timeframes and with much greater efficiency and variety.”</em></p>
<p><em><br />
“For conscious evolution to be successful, we need to observe and understand the actual workings of nature, in all its dynamism, to the point of profound reverence, or ‘worship.’ This is what I call extreme nature-worshipping… From the perspective of extreme nature-worshipping, the real significance of Darwin’s evolutionary theory is not that humans descended from lower species, but that we can continue to evolve.”</em>(Cosmic Beings: Transhumanist Deism in Ted Chu’s Cosmic View, Institute for Ethics &amp; Emerging Technology, Giulio Prisco)</p>
<p>The vicious name-calling, seething resentment toward and censorship of the six day creation account and of all who profess and teach it should raise the eyebrows of any rational thinking person.  If evolution really is a fact of science then why the irrational name-calling, ridicule, scorn, shunning, resentment, intolerance and demonization?</p>
<p>The answer is that the zealous worshipper of evolution is the Spirit of our age that emerged out of the Renaissance whose answer to the Lord Jesus Christ is the Cross (crucify Him) and whose fulfillment will be the Wicked One. (2 Thess. 2:1-8)</p>
<p>From the Renaissance to our own time the Spirit has been transgressing, blaspheming, and departing that it need not obey His voice.   Like a dog returning to its own vomit, the Spirit has returned to its first love: the cult of demons in the Godless universe of matter, psychic energy, and animated forces where time is changed, past history rendered meaningless, and the liberated Spirit imbibes the cup of wrath, an intoxicating mixture of Babylonian Mysteries, incantations, spiritism, Gnosticism, sorcery, witchcraft, Hermetic magic, Kabbalah, reincarnation, astrology, and other devilish occult traditions.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation pinpoints Babylon as the post-flood center of an occult pagan Mystery religion based on advaitic monism, science of magic transformism, exalted priesthood, gnosis, secret initiations, psychic-powers, familiar spirits, androgyny, sexual perversions, and other evils.</p>
<p>Babylon embraced the Great Lie. Its inhabitants claimed the title, &#8220;I AM.&#8221; The root source of this evil religion and its occult power was the Great Dragon himself&#8230;.Lucifer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. <em>the Great Lie </em>(is) <em>the foundation stone of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, Sikhism, Taoism, the Kabala, the Greek Hermetic, Eleusinian and Gnostic beliefs, Neo-Platonism, all the occult creeds from Theosophy and the Masonic orders to the Rosicrucian&#8217;s (and) the New Age movement. The Great Lie is&#8230;the belief that man is God, that his true identity is the immortal self&#8230;that as God, he will never die </em>(and) <em>Sin and depravity are&#8230;illusions since this inner divinity is at man&#8217;s core.&#8221;</em> (The Great Lie, Tal Brooke, SCP Journal, Vol. 29:2-29:3, 2005)</p>
<p>Though the Spirit of our age claims the title “I AM” it nevertheless follows after and falls down before other fascinating men: theoreticians of evolutionary science, nature philosophy and evolutionary pagan theology. These charismatic Pied Pipers are possessed of surpassing powers of persuasion and inflexible determination of will to which the Spirit assigns more honor than to anything else.</p>
<p>The Spirit has usurped the throne of the Word Incarnate (John 1:1) because He is not good, not just or benevolent but a devil, an evil Tyrant Who, with His infliction of suffering in this life and eternal punishment in the next must be deposed. (Psalm 2:2-3)</p>
<p>Blaming our Lord for their own sins the proud, self-righteous Spirit of rebellion, hypocrisy and negation says to Him, “…<em>you are not my father</em>.”  My father is the god of forces, therefore:<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;I am I, I come out of myself, and in choice and action I make myself.&#8221;</em> (Daniel Bell, quoted by Herbert Schlossberg in &#8220;Idols for Destruction,&#8221; p. 43)</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the Spirit of our age is the “<em>striving human will</em>” seeking desperately to launch itself,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;into minor godhood in an evolving cosmos through the mechanisms of directed spiritual evolution, spiritualized science and spirit contact</em>.&#8221; The &#8216;new&#8217; spirituality now presents itself as the <em>&#8220;rightful replacement for the Revealed Word </em>(and)<em> proclaims its spiritual liberation from the worldview that informs Christianity and its freedom from </em>(the)<em> personal and wholly other God.  But this new way of self-salvation</em> (is)<em> little more than the refurbishing of an ancient spiritual mistake</em>.&#8221;  (The Making of the New Spirituality: the Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 279)</p>
<p><strong>“As it was in the days of Noah…” </strong></p>
<p>The ominous signs of this age are obvious, said the English theologian G.H. Pember (1837-1910) in his book, &#8220;<em>The Antichrist Babylon and the Coming Kingdom</em>.&#8221;  Just as it was during the pre-flood generations, open intercourse with demons (spiritism) is now common throughout Christendom and even in Russia.   In France it is the national pastime.   The apostles of the powers of darkness are everywhere proclaiming their scientific and evolutionary theories demonstrating that the world created itself and had no need of a Creator (p. 60) while the miseries which have resulted from sin,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>are blasphemously charged upon the Almighty, Who so loved the world as to give His son for it </em>(but is now)<em> impiously forbidden to curb and discipline the rebels who owe their existence to the breath of His mouth.  And when we see such men as John Stuart Mill </em>(and) <em>John Morley, the late Chief Secretary for Ireland&#8230;guiding their fellows to defiant insubordination, we can scarcely wonder that Bradlaugh&#8230;said, ‘This world might have been happy, had not the shadow of God fallen upon it.</em>” (pp. 35-36, 1888)</p>
<p><strong>Rise of Occult Evolutionary Science </strong></p>
<p>In the impeccably researched, &#8220;<em>The Making of the New Spirituality</em>,&#8221; James Herrick observes that the scientific tradition in Renaissance Europe developed around three basic approaches: the organic, the mechanical and the magical.   It was magical and/or occult science that provided the greatest impetus for scientific exploration. (p. 45)</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis underscores this point in “<em>The Abolition of Man</em>:”</p>
<p>“<em>You will even find people who write about the sixteenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know better. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse. I allow that some (certainly not all) of the early scientists were actuated by a pure love of knowledge. But if we consider the temper of that age as a whole we can discern the impulse of which I speak.”</em></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>God and the Knowledge of Reality</em>,&#8221; the Catholic philosopher and historian, Thomas Molnar (1921–2010), reveals the &#8216;temper of that age&#8217; as a spirit of rebellion against the Christian God, and this is why occult science and evolutionary thinking provided the greatest impetus. During the Renaissance, certain Christian theologians, mystics and scholars such as Emanuel Swedenborg had discovered Hermetic magic and occult Jewish Kabbalah texts which they studied and translated resulting in Hermetic Kabbalah. Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science – the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures (spiritual evolution) is the best proof of the divinity of Christ. In other words said Molnar,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;..by the time of the Renaissance the esoteric texts of the first centuries A.D. had acquired in scholarly and humanist circles an unparalleled prestige, confronting as equals the texts held sacred by the church. In Pico&#8217;s estimation, &#8216;nulla est scientia que nos magis certificet de divinitate Christ quam magia et Cabala&#8217; (there is no science that would prove for us Christ&#8217;s divinity better than magic and the Cabala.)&#8221; </em>(pp. 78-79)</p>
<p>Hermetic magic and Jewish Kabbalah are ancient Mystery Religion traditions, as affirmed by G. H. Pember in his classic work, &#8220;<em>Earth&#8217;s Earliest Ages.&#8221;   </em>Pember thoroughly examines the role of fallen angels in connection with the magic (occult transformism) they taught to pre-flood generations and compares them to the explosion of spiritism (open intercourse with evil spirits), astrology, the Mysteries and other occult traditions sweeping over Christendom.</p>
<p>Pember writes that the Mysteries are no longer veiled in mystery but boldly presented by the powerful occult brotherhood that emerged out of the Renaissance as the fruit of modern science, especially evolutionary philosophy, which the brotherhood assert was included in the instructions given,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>to the initiates of the Hermetic, Orphic, Eleusinian, and Cabbalistic mysteries, and were familiar to Chaldean Magi, Egyptian Priests, Hindu Occultists, Essenes, Therapeutae Gnostics, and Theurgic Neo-Platonists</em>.&#8221; (Pember, pp.243-244)</p>
<p><strong>Hermetic Magic<br />
</strong><br />
Hermeticism is an ancient Egyptian secret magic tradition based on a set of fourteen books known</p>
<p>collectively as the Corpus Hermeticum attributed to a mysterious figure known as Hermes Trismegistus. Implied in Hermeticism is an evolutionary process of magical transformism (spiritual evolution) moving from one kind of lower thing to another kind of higher thing:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Human beings are themselves the product of a long spiritual evolutionary process that moves from &#8216;creeping things&#8217; to fish, mammals, birds and then people.  Humans can&#8212;through occult knowledge and extraordinary ability&#8212;continue this evolutionary process and become daemons, then gods, and finally planets or stars</em>.&#8221; (The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 40)</p>
<p>With respect to Hermes identity, researchers of antiquity are divided.  Some believe Hermes was a mythical figure.  Others argue he was Ham or his son Cush.  The historian Samuel Shuckford argues that Hermes was Pathrusim, king of Thebais, the son of Mizraim, the son of Ham.   His Egyptian name was Tyoth or Thoth.  (The Sacred and Profane History of the World Connected, 1808)</p>
<p>In any case, it was Thoth-Hermes who instructed his brothers in the arts and science magic of alchemy or transmutation of a lower kind of thing into a higher kind of thing. For example, after a lengthy transformative process out of the eternally existing divine abyss (primordial matter), the self-created Sun-God Ra boasted that he “<em>came into being from primordial matter.”  </em>He made all the forms under which he<em> “appeared by means of the god-soul” </em>which he raised up out of Nu, primordial matter. (The Long War Against God, Dr. Henry Morris, p. 243)</p>
<p><strong>Occult Kabalah</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Kabalah is the key to the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists</em>.” (Occult Mason Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 626)</p>
<p>Like its’ Hermetic counterpart, Kabala implies a process of evolutionary transformism:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;the older Enoch book </em>(gives) <em>a fuller insight into the &#8220;Merkabah&#8221; and &#8220;Bereshit&#8221; lore of the ancients than the &#8220;Hekalot,&#8221; which present but fragments, while the central figure of the Cabala, Meṭaṭron-Enoch, is seen in ch. lxx.-lxxi. in a process of transformation</em>.” (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Helena Blavatsky, one of the key architects of Luciferian New Age pantheism, Kabalah derived,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em> from the older secret doctrines concerning divine things and cosmogony, which were combined into a theology after the time of the captivity of the Jews in Babylon. All the works that fall under the esoteric category are termed Kabalistic.” </em>(Blavatsky, Theosophical Glossary, p. 168)</p>
<p>The godless cosmogony of Kabala teaches the gradual condensation or evolutionary progression of a primal substance into visible matter.  This is a fundamental,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em> doctrine of the Cabala </em>(and<em>) is the ancient Semitic conception of the ‘primal ocean,’ known to the Babylonians as ‘Apsu’ and called by the Gnostics βύθος =</em>  (Anz, ‘Die Frage nach dem Ursprung des Gnostizismus,’ p. 98).</p>
<p>The Chaldean occult science and pagan Mystery Religion was embraced by apostate Jews during their captivity in Babylon and delivered to subsequent generations of initiates by word of mouth. According to Blavatsky, these initiates of the Chaldean tradition in the centuries before Christ were known as Tanaim:<br />
<em>“The kabalist is a student of ‘secret science’, one who interprets the hidden meaning of the</em></p>
<p><em>Scriptures with the help of the symbolical Kabala… The Tanaim were the first kabalists among the Jews; they appeared at Jerusalem about the beginning of the third century before the Christian era… This secret doctrine is identical with the Persian wisdom, or ‘magic’</em>.” (Ibid. p.167)</p>
<p>The Essenes were also associated with the Kabala. The Jewish Encyclopedia describes the cabalistic practices of the Essenes, which were Judaized elements of Eastern mystical traditions:</p>
<p>“<em>So, too, were the Essenes familiar with the idea of the journey to heaven…and they were also masters of angelology. The practice of magic and incantation, the angelology and demonology, were borrowed from Babylonia, Persia, and Egypt; but these foreign elements were Judaized in the process, and took the form of the mystical adoration of the name of God and of speculations regarding the mysterious power of the Hebrew alphabet …, ‘the name of God creates and destroys worlds’, to become, finally, foundations of the philosophy of the ‘Sefer Yetzirah</em>.&#8221;  (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Blavatsky the Essenes were pagan priests of the Greek goddess, Diana of Ephesus, where the Tanaim had established a college for instruction in the Chaldean mystery religion:</p>
<p>“<em>Essenes&#8230; had many Buddhistic ideas and practices; and it is noteworthy that the priests of the Great Mother at Ephesus, Diana-Bhavani with many breasts, were also denominated&#8230; It was at Ephesus where was the great College of the Essenes and all the lore the Tanaim had brought from the Chaldees&#8230; Essenes, believed in reincarnation</em>.” (Theosophical Glossary, pp. 113-14; The Secret Doctrine, Vol. II, p. 111n)</p>
<p>Eventually Alexandria, Egypt became the epicenter of cosmological and pagan religious ideas as well as the intellectual meeting point between Greek Mystery Religion/Hermetic magic initiates and nature sages and guardians of Kabala.  After the fall of Jerusalem, Alexandria was the center from which occult pagan Jews would disguise their mystery tradition in Christian terminology and attempt to penetrate the fledgling Church with heresy.</p>
<p>One of the primary tactics employed by Cabbalist pagan Jews for this purpose is the same one employed by their modern evolutionary Gnostic pagan counterparts.   It involves the reduction of the Genesis account, particularly the first three books, to allegory and myth, a ploy that eliminates the physical Adam from which all people descended and the sin that he transferred to the rest of the human race. This strikes directly at the heart of the Gospel: the need for the ‘last Adam’ to provide for us an escape from the wrath of God against sin incurred by the first Adam.  In this way, not only is the work of Christ on the cross rendered superfluous, meaning the heart of the faith is ripped out, but God is made responsible for sin and evil. (1 Peter 3:18-22; 1 John 2:22)</p>
<p>Long ago, the teachings of some of the early Church Fathers regarding the apostasy toward the end of the church age predicted the reappearance of this evil tactic. The fathers categorized it a Gnostic pagan heresy.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Heresies 6.10&#8243;</em> Hippolytus writes that the Gnostic pagan Simon Magus feigned faith and allegorized much of Scripture, especially Genesis, to support his evolutionary Hermetic and Gnostic occult pantheist teachings.   Church Fathers Ireneaus, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria reveal that Gnostic cult leader Marcion rejected the Old Testament, taught that the God of the Old Testament and his prophets are evil, made God the author of sin and removed all references that Christ was Creator (John 1:1)   (Ireneaus, &#8220;Against Heresies 1.26, 5.1,&#8221; Tertullian &#8220;Against Marcion 2.17,&#8221; Clement of Alexandria, &#8220;Against Heresies 4.29)</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Babylonian Mystery Religion is the mother of evolutionary Cabala, Gnosticism and all other occult pagan traditions:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;.especially does Gnosticism testify to the antiquity of the Cabala. Of Chaldean origin&#8230; Gnosticism was Jewish in character long before it became Christian&#8230; Gnosticism—that is, the cabalistic ‘Hokmah’ (wisdom)—seems to have been the first attempt on the part of the Jewish sages to give the empirical mystic lore, with the help of Platonic and Pythagorean or Stoic ideas, a speculative turn; hence the danger of heresy…of which the systems of Philo, an adept in Cabala&#8230;show many pitfalls&#8230;Jewish gnosticism unquestionably antedates Christianity, for Biblical exegesis had already reached an age of five hundred years by the first century C.E.  Judaism had been in close contact with Babylonian-Persian ideas for at least that length of time, and for nearly as long a period with Hellenistic ideas. Magic, also, which,&#8230;was a not unimportant part of the doctrines and manifestations of gnosticism, largely occupied Jewish thinkers. There is, in general, no circle of ideas to which elements of gnosticism have been traced, and with which the Jews were not acquainted.”  </em>(Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p><strong>Building  the New Tower of Babylon</strong></p>
<p>In the essay,<em> “The Paganization of Biblical Studies</em>,” Dr. Peter Jones, director of truthxchange and adjunct professor of Westminster Seminary CA., writes that the books of the evolutionary Gnostic pagan Presbyterian heretic Lloyd Geering, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University, are promoted by the most powerful element of the Spirit of our age—the international occult New Age Luciferian elite-pagans&#8212;as programmatic templates for the future utopian pagan community from the point of view of Christian apostasy and socialism undergirded by evolutionary pantheist orthodoxy.</p>
<p>According to Geering, the world&#8217;s future culture will be post-Christian, global, religiously pagan and evolutionary.  This agenda is remarkably similar to that of Teilhard de Chardins’ disciple, the ex-Roman Catholic Thomas Berry in his book, <em>&#8220;The Great Work</em>&#8221; which is also being implemented through texts of the UN&#8217;s global programs.</p>
<p>The rising New World Order will be post-Christian because evolution proves that human beings, as they evolved out of primordial matter, created language, then symbols, then religious explanations and God Himself.  Therefore tomorrow&#8217;s culture will be pluralistic, syncretistic, relativistic and poly-gendered because evolution integrates all scientific, cultural, religious, economic and human gender into one worldwide anthill thus when the global society emerges from the evolutionary process,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…it will require humanity to develop a new consciousness and a new form of spirituality</em>&#8221; because <em>&#8220;the new story which has become basic to the global world begins with a new word or idea&#8230;evolution.” </em>(ibid, Jones)</p>
<p>Like its’ mother, Mystery Babylon, the scientifically-enlightened ‘new&#8217; global religion of evolutionary transformism is occult pantheist advaita monism, which means that as an ancient impersonal god-force is within the cosmos, earth, human beings, rats, weeds, tumble bugs, cancer and everything else then all things are essentially &#8216;one.&#8217;  Since the god-force is within all things it is within the demonically &#8216;illumined&#8217; consciousness of every spiritually evolved initiate and adept.</p>
<p>This being the case, by means of trance states, brain-altering drugs, transcendental meditation, visualization, channeling, Zen Buddhism, Kundalini yoga, tantra, and other occult ways, the initiate can channel the god-force within thereby becoming a little god who controls matter because he controls mind. The physical world then, is an illusion because reality is inside the divine mind of the god-man.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is captured by Orwell in his book, “<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>” in which negation of the physical world is an integral part of the social and political philosophy of Big Brother and his despotic Party. At one stage in the book, Winston stumbles upon the shocking realization that in the end the Party would announce that two plus two made five because the logic of Big Brothers’ position required it since the existence of external reality was denied by his philosophy.  Thus when the Thought Police agent O’Brien tortures Winston for politically incorrect “wrong thought” he states,</p>
<p><em>“We control matter because we control the mind.  Reality is inside the skull.  You will learn by degrees, Winston.  There is nothing that we could not do.  Invisibility, levitation&#8212;anything.  I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to….You must get rid of these nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature.  We make the laws of Nature.” </em>(Orwell, “The New Spirituality and its Hallmarks, Alan Morrison, SCP Journal, Vol. 30:4-31:1, 2007, p. 19)</p>
<p><strong>Evolving Toward Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>The Aquarian Conspiracy</em>,&#8221; a book that has been called &#8216;the New Age Bible,&#8217; Marilyn Ferguson (1938-2008) admits that the ‘new age’ evolutionary pantheism and occult technologies being employed throughout America were at one time the private domain of ancient initiates.   In fact, as Constance Cumbey reveals in her thoroughly researched book, <em>&#8220;The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow,&#8221;</em> many New Age historians claim their occult religion and techniques originated in Atlantis and afterward were preserved in the ancient land of Babylon,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;and surrounding Plains of Shinar and from there disseminated throughout the earth, including Taoist doctrines of China, Mayan-Aztec teachings of Mexico and Central/South America; Great Spirit teachings of the American Indians, Hindu/Buddhist teachings of Asia, etc.&#8221; </em>(pp. 250-251)</p>
<p>After the Flood, said Shuckford, while the faithful Noah remained in the East and established the worship of the true God, eighty years after the Flood his rebellious son Ham and his sons together with other family members departed and eventually settled in the plains of Shinar where they resolved to build a tower, a monument to their own pride, vanity, ambition and rebellion against God. (ibid, p.94)</p>
<p>It was Noah’s son Ham, according to ancient Church Father Clement, who  ‘preserved’ and revived the Mystery Religion of ‘Atlantis’ and its attendant evils:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Fallen angels taught men the use of magical incantations that would force demons to obey man. After the flood Ham the son of Noah&#8230;discovered this and taught it to his sons.  This became ingrained into the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians.  Ham died shortly after the fall of the Tower of Babel.  Nimrod, called Ninus by the Greeks, was handed this knowledge and by it caused men to go away from the worship of God and go into diverse and erratic superstitions and they began to be governed by the signs in the stars and motions of the planets</em>.&#8221; (Recognitions of Clement 4.26-29)</p>
<p>In his well-researched book, &#8220;<em>Ancient Post-Flood History</em>,&#8221; Ken Johnson, Th.D., reports that the sons of Ham persuaded the people to accept that the true God was merely an impersonal creative force within all of nature, making man the highest form of life/god.  Through the power of persuasion, Ham and his sons revived magical evolutionary transformism, pantheism and idolatry. (pp. 47-48)</p>
<p>Eventually Ham was deified and worshipped by later pagans as the gods Cronus and Jupiter:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ham is represented by many writers as a very wicked, immodest, and profligate creature: Berosus (i) makes him a magician, and to be the same with Zoroast or Zoroastres, and speaks of him as the public corrupter of mankind; and says that he taught men to live as before the flood, to lie with mothers, sisters, daughters, males and brutes, and creatures of all sorts; and that he actually did so himself, and therefore was cast out by his father Janus, or Noah, and got the name of &#8220;Chem&#8221;, the infamous and immodest&#8230;&#8221; Upon seeing his father&#8217;s nakedness Ham,  &#8220;told his two brethren without; he went out of the tent after he had pleased himself with the sight&#8230; and in a wanton, ludicrous, and scoffing manner, related what he had seen: some of the Jewish Rabbins (k), as Jarchi relates, say that Canaan first saw it, and told his father of it; and some say (l), that he or Ham committed an unnatural crime with him; and others (m), that he castrated him; and hence, it is supposed, came the stories of Jupiter castrating his father Saturn, and Chronus his father Uranus.&#8221; </em>   Genesis 9:22 Gill&#8217;s Exposition</p>
<p>History did not begin after billions of years of evolution when primitive hominids swung down from the trees and discovered how to scratch crude symbols onto rocks.    Nor did it begin after the Flood.  At least 2,000 years of human existence preceded the Flood, meaning that when Noah and his family entered the ark they carried at least one hundred years of pre-flood memories, traditions, technology, and superior knowledge. Their world view was shaped by the historical Adam and Eve and the generations of their offspring.   Thus Noah and his family brought with them not only the knowledge of the personal God, Special Creation, fall of man, the Deluge, sacrifice to God for the propitiation of sin, the arts of weapon-making and warfare, knowledge of letters, symbols, math, architecture, science, cosmetics, and agriculture  but knowledge of  first-hand encounters with Watchers, their occult teachings, the Nephilim, and primeval pantheism tied to magic, spiritism, herbal abortifacients, human and animal sacrifice, drinking of blood, males marrying males and even beasts, and many other evils.</p>
<p>In affirmation, the eminent researcher of antiquity James Bailey said:</p>
<p>“…<em>human history can now be hesitantly traced back as an unbroken narrative to 4000 B.C….the picture emerging…is one of the Fall of Man in historic terms as well as his rise; it is a picture…more of degradation than of success; it is a picture of monotheism breaking down into polytheism and of the struggle to return to monotheism.  The establishment view of the history of religion gradually progressing from animism to polytheism </em>(then)<em> to monotheism is the reverse of facts</em>.” (“The God-Kings and the Titans: The New World Ascendancy in Ancient Times 1973, p. 296)</p>
<p>Four thousand years before Christ were the antediluvian generations and the Watchers in the post-flood world, making the billions of years of evolutionary transformism a fabulous fable.  It is neither ‘new’ (Ecclesiastes 1: 9-11) nor scientific except in the sense of pre-flood and post-flood occult science and attendant traditions revised and revamped for our own time, as Geering unhappily discovered.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones writes that Geering was surprised when he found out that the<em> ‘New Spirituality’ </em>has <em>&#8220;links with pre-monotheistic&#8230;nature religions,</em>&#8221; leading Jones to wryly comment that in an odd turn of events,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;.contemporary spiritual&#8217; evolution goes backwards!  Biblical theism disturbed evolutionary progress.  The clocks have to be put back </em>(for we are in the presence of)<em> a powerful pagan/Gnostic theological agenda, claiming to be spanking new, objective and scientific, but as old as the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>Clocks have to be turned back, all the way back to the days of Noah in the pre-flood world where evolution is closely connected to the devil’s lie that man is a being who though presently limited in time and space is nevertheless capable of achieving a great leap of being and magically evolving into a much more powerful god-like being in the future.</p>
<p>As the scientifically endarkened Gnostic pagan Spirit of our age simultaneously worships on the altar of ‘self’ as it self-righteously peers down its’ long, pointy nose and contemptuously sniffs and sneers at the remnant of backwards, unscientific, anti-evolution  faithful, in reality it is the entirely deluded pagan Spirit that is on a collision course with a modern version of the pre-flood world catastrophe&#8212;-and we know how badly that ended.</p>

			<p><strong>Part 1:  Changing the DNA structure of the Mother Nature&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/belgianblue3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>In the 20st century, the human mob re-arranged rivers, deserts, rainforests and the oceans to suit its voracious appetite for dominance over the Natural World.  Stemming from that 100-year epic onslaught, we humans created communities around the globe featuring 10 million, 20 million to 36 million people piled up in mega-cities around the world.</p>
<p>We contaminated rivers with our poisons, the air with our fossil fuel exhaust and clear cut rainforests by the millions of acres.  Our onslaught of the Natural World continues with 80 to 100 species of our fellow travelers losing their existence 24/7 to our encroachment upon their habitat. (Source: Norman Myers, Oxford University)</p>
<p>One of our most prolific acts continues on the bees and other pollinators around the world.  In the past 50 years, we poisoned every crop with hundreds of chemical herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers, which, in turn, caused trillions of bees to suffer “Colony Collapse” throughout the world.  Without the bees, which I wrote about earlier this year, our species cannot feed itself.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, in the 21st century, in order to feed our 7.2 billion in numbers, we began tinkering with the structural DNA of plants and animals. </p>
<p>Today, our scientists change the DNA patterns of fish and plants in order to make them bigger, grow faster and yield more harvest: genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p>But we forgot to ask Mother Nature if our meddling in her business would cause any harm.  Amazingly, we allow governments, scientists on the payroll of companies like ADM and Monsanto, to tell us that such activities work to make our lives better with no harm to the natural world.</p>
<p>With my research on GMOs connecting their horrific harm to the Natural World and ultimately to we humans, this series will show you the “GMO Frankenstein” being foisted upon us by ugly businessmen in high places to could care less about you, your family or the rest of the species sharing this planet with us.</p>
<p>My intention in writing this series: to educate you to the incredible damage GMO foods cause you along with your family and more important: the horrific destruction to the Natural World.</p>
<p>If you look at human cancers spreading like wildfire across America and the world and every physical ailment we face in America, along the accelerating damage to bees, other pollinators and to the fish in our oceans—you will become appalled at this onslaught and its final consequences.</p>
<p>Investigative reporter Jeremy Siefert said, “When people first hear about just the basic facts concerning Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs or Genetically Engineered Foods) – the DNA of seeds altered with genes from other organisms like bacteria so food crops can withstand herbicides that will kill all other plants, patented by giant chemical companies and found in 80% of processed foods – the standard response is “Oh, my God.” For some, it’s just an exclamation, but for others, it’s the beginnings of a prayer. There’s a mixture of horror and disbelief, as if finding out we’re living inside a very strange sci-fi novel. Beyond that, it’s the sting of humiliation from being ignorant about something so big, mixed with the anger that comes from feeling like you’ve been duped.</p>
<p>“Even without understanding what a GMO is or why it matters, most of us believe as citizens of a supposedly free and democratic society that we have the right to know if GMOs are in the food we eat. The fact we don’t know, and that our right to know has been taken away by corporate greed and government collusion, should upset and mobilize people. When all the food and seed and water and air is owned and patented by giant multinational corporations, will we even protest? Do we have the wakefulness and willpower to take that first step and stand up for this basic right?” (Source: <a href="http://www.fairworldproject.org">www.fairworldproject.org</a>)</p>
<p>What I discovered in my research: ADM and Monsanto do not want you to know, along with high government officials, the deleterious effects on the Natural World that GMO food production causes in the long run.  These mega-giant corporations “own” regulatory agencies, government officials (bribes or dandy trips to anywhere in the world), and other complicit chemical companies around the world.</p>
<p>Be warned, you will not like the kind of treachery being foisted upon you by your U.S. Congress and officials who should present a moral and ethical stance against GMOs, but fail us because of one item: money.</p>
<p>Thus, as we move through this series, you may choose to save yourself and your family by buying “Certified Organic Foods” along with “Certified Non-Genetically Modified Organism” foods that give you the nutrients of Mother Nature without the “Frankenization” of your food supply and of the planet’s natural systems.  Additionally, Monsanto and other HUGE corporations work every angle to stop any “GMO” labeling of their poisonous foods.  Why do you think the do that?</p>
<p>If this information educates you enough, you may take action provided in the organizations and leaders trying to rid the world of GMOs.  Help them and ultimately, you will help your family.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if these “monsters” of Monsanto and ADM get their way, they will cripple this world, all living creatures and the structural systems that allow all life on Earth to remain in balance and allow us all to thrive.</p>

<p>When defending Western Civilization, some confuse that secular humanism, practiced as the current dominate popular culture, represents that lineage. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The decadence and decline in the West is undeniable. Yet the heritage upon which European civilization is based, owes a profound debt of gratitude to the societies that developed out of the brute force of empire and adopted principles of natural law and individual dignity. A direct correlation to the gospel of Christ becomes the centerpiece of this glorious tradition of universal brotherhood, that keeps man’s inhumanity to man in check.</p>
<p>The well-documented failures of institutions and regimes would have been far worse if left to the devices of pagan appetites or atheist’s hubris. However, the memory of the eternal struggle is short lived in the minds of most people. Confusion reigns because of a lack of knowledge, perspective and especially will, to admit that the New World Order is the invention of satanic factions that lust for control of the entire planet and beyond.</p>
<p>Therefore, the extraordinary essay by Pat Buchanan, <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/putin-vs-cultural-marxism-whose-side-is-god-on-now">Putin vs. Cultural Marxism: Whose Side Is God on Now?</a>, is a required penance for all those who have sinned.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In his Kremlin defense of <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-return-of-ethnic-nationalism-is-europe-cracking-up">Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea</a>, Russia is a Christian country, Putin was saying.This speech recalls last December&#8217;s address where the former KGB chief spoke of Russia as standing against a <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/news/6007/print">decadent West</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values. Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With Marxism-Leninism a dead faith, Putin is saying the new ideological struggle is between a debauched West led by the United States and a traditionalist world Russia would be proud to lead.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Before dismissing Putin as just a KGB thug, read <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/061012.html">Vladimir Putin Nemesis of the New World Order</a>. Then do your own research on <a href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Karl_Marx.html">Marx</a> and <a href="http://www.jewwatch.com/jew-leaders-lenin.html">Lenin</a>’s clan of <a href="http://www.analysis-news.com/AnUnderstanding/Understanding-X.htm">Khazar Bolsheviks</a>. Finally, transcend the issue just about the motives of Putin and focus on the Christian roots of the Russian population.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfaturiortodoxe.ro/orthodox/orthodox_advices_seraphim_rose_american_orthodoxy.htm">The Orthodox Revival in Russia</a> by Fr. Seraphim Rose cites the experiences and significance of <a href="http://batr.org/view_/052902.html">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> and Father Dimitry Dudko.Solzhenitsyn spoke of Gulag—a secular term; Fr. Dimitry speaks of Golgotha—the Christian understanding of the Soviet experience. The central part of Fr. Dimitry&#8217;s—and contemporary Russia&#8217;s—message to us is that all the sufferings inflicted by atheism have a meaning—we can find Christ in them… Here are a few passages of Fr. Dimitry&#8217;s teaching:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In our land has occurred Golgotha; the torments of all the martyrs begin gradually to cleanse the air… The present crucifixion of Christ in Russia, the persecutions and mockings only lead to the resurrection of faith in men… This gives us strength, firmness, makes us better than we are now… Let us imagine the state of our martyrs. Did the thought of sinning occur to them at this moment? No matter what kind of sinners they may have been in this minute they become saints… And those who suffer for those condemned to death also become better. How many martyrs there have been in Russia—and therefore, how many holy feelings! Will these holy feelings really give no fruit? And perhaps we live and will live only by the feelings of the holy martyrs, being supported by them… In our country now is Golgotha. Christ is crucified. Golgotha is not merely sufferings, but such sufferings as lead to resurrection and enlighten men… Our time can be compared only with the first three centuries of Christianity, and perhaps then it was even easier; then they did not yet know all the refinements of subtle torture… If one compares the religious state here and in the West, the balance is on our side. Why? Because here we have Golgotha, and there they don&#8217;t. Does an abundance of material goods give a religious rebirth? … Here we have nothing, but if people believe they are ready to die for their faith.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fr. Rose provides his assessment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His truthfulness and fiery faith have made many enemies—sadly enough, even among Orthodox Christians. Some have found him too emotional, too apocalyptic, too messianic—and it is true that such a fiery, urgent, Orthodox preaching hasn&#8217;t been heard in Russia and probably the whole Orthodox world since the days of St. John of Kronstadt; many Orthodox people have become self-satisfied with their &#8220;correct and proper&#8221; Orthodoxy and are somehow offended when Orthodoxy is preached and communicated so warmly to everyone who will listen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you just imagine such a discussion in the western media or even among Dispensationalist Christians, who are preoccupied in taking up the sword to champion Zionism? Any comparison between the West and Mother Russia would be incomplete without the insight of the audacious Brother Nathanael Kapner, <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=205">Putin’s Purge Of The Rothschild Money Changers</a>.In a televised Christmas message on January 7 2008 Putin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Russian Orthodox Church contributes to the promotion of moral values in society. One should not completely draw a line between the culture and the church. Of course by law in our country the church is separate from the state. But in the soul and the history of our people it’s all together. It always has been and always will be.&#8221; — <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/138/story_13827_1.html">Here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brother Nathanael leaves nothing unsaid in <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=84">PUTIN VS JEWS OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2006 <a href="http://www.twq.com/08spring/docs/08spring_gaddy.pdf">Putin had paid off Russia’s debt to the Rothschilds</a>. Russia’s financial dependence on the Jewish financiers was now over. Putin could then establish what became his <em>Russian Unity Party’s</em> 2007 <a href="http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2007/84/01.html">campaign slogan</a>: Putin’s Plan Means Victory For Russia! This slogan continues to make the<em> New World Order</em> Jews very nervous…<a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=198">Here</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While these sentiments are several years old, make no mistake about it, they are even truer today, with the efforts of the <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/040313.html">BRICS Development Bank to replace the IMF</a>.</p>
<p>For a more current description, look to Pastor Scott Lively in <a href="http://www.scottlively.net/2013/10/18/report-from-moscow/">Report from Moscow</a>, and a summary of a reversal of roles, read on.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Russia is today experiencing a Christian revival and is decidedly NOT communist. Some 30,000 churches have been built in the last year, and the ones in Moscow are reportedly overflowing with worshippers on Sundays. Most of the church is Orthodox, which is steeped in tradition, but at the same time relevant to the modern society.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;How incredibly ironic it is that Russia is now our best hope for stopping the conquest of the world by the &#8220;progressives.&#8221; On <a href="https://02varvara.wordpress.com/tag/fr-dmitri-smirnov/">Father Dimitri’s</a> television show, I made the point that the Americans and the Soviets both won and both lost the Cold War. The Americans broke the Soviet system through economic strategies and tactics. But before they collapsed, the Soviets poisoned the United States with Cultural Marxism, promoting moral degeneracy and family breakdown through so-called &#8220;progressive&#8221; ideology. Today, post-Soviet Russia is re-emerging as a Christian nation, while the United States is becoming a &#8220;Gay Soviet Union.&#8221; What a strange turn of events.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qzqnhj8W9Ac" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Echoing this conclusion is the report <a href="http://www.spc.rs/eng/russia_religious_revival_brings_new_life_orthodox_media">In Russia, a religious revival brings new life to Orthodox media</a>. &#8220;After 70 years of state-imposed atheism and 20 years that have run the gamut from glasnost to post-Soviet chaos to a revival of Russian pride, Russians have increasingly embraced their Orthodox roots.&#8221; The video <a href="http://youtu.be/qzqnhj8W9Ac">Christianity Grows in Russia &amp; Declines in the West</a> is to the point.The Latin Papacy has lost its spiritual way often over the millenniums and the Scofield Christian-Zionist apostate bible thumpers betray the Gospel of Christ with their devotion to the Talmud perversion of the Old Testament. Both need to seek repentance. Once the enemy of Christianity, when Russia was Rothschild’s USSR, today a revival of Christianity has started.</p>
<p>Western Secularism, which encapsulates the immoral ethos that underpins the globalist economic model, based upon a rejection of authentic Christian teaching, is the downfall of humanity.</p>
<p>If Russia can salvage their society from atheist communism, surely the West has the ability to humble themselves and repent for their depraved chutzpah and wicked ways. The <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/index.html">Totalitarian Collectivism</a> that has destroyed the Christian culture on both sides of the Atlantic must return to their traditional roots.</p>
<p>Michael Hoffman on ‘<a href="http://realcurrencies.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/meet-the-real-deal-michael-hoffman-on-usury-in-christendom/">Usury in Christendom</a>’ is essential, <em>‘…freedom from interest on money, is essentially the battle for freedom from the Money Power</em>’. The West has become the &#8220;Money Changers&#8221;, because the temple has subverted commerce by heretical destruction of faith and separation from God. By destroying traditional Christian religious belief, the secular body is defenseless. Such a message is radical to most, because it is reactionary to the spiritual non-believer.</p>
<p>Former Russian President <a href="http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2011/11/president-dmitry-medvedev-speaks-on.html">Dmitry Medvedev</a> has spoken of the &#8220;fruitfulness of cooperation between the Russian Orthodox Church and government and public institutions and called the revival of Orthodox Christianity in Russian in the past two decades a miracle.&#8221; The West needs a spiritual revival of its own conception. If the Russia Bear can be tamed, what prevents the American eagle from souring once again?</p>

			<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/racist.jpg" alt="" />For the last half century, the American population, subjected to the greatest dumbing down experiment of psychological manipulation in all of history, has resulted in the adoption of a cultural separation from realty and true self-interest. With all the glorious aspirations, that celebrate a diverse society, the fact that humankind shares the same planet usually is not enough to resolve disparities. While DNA <a href="http://batr.org/archives/part2.html">similarities</a> are the basis of the specie, the genetic differences among races, put aside and banished from polite conversation, still are true and significant. Yet the civilizations that make up this world function as if the tribal differences are often paramount in the social order.The intentional indoctrination that all races are equal rests upon a specious supposition that the goals, objectives and ambitions assign a uniform desire. Once upon a time immigration to the New World came from a European heritage. That influx of settlers provided a similar experience if not an identical cultural attitude. With the introduction of the slave trade economy, the forced transplanting of African captives, initiated a road to social dissolution as demonstrated in today’s racial conflicts.</p>
<p>The notion that this country is a harmonious society fails because of a very basic element that few people will admit. Blacks, Caucasians, Oriental, Native Americans and any combination of mixed races all have an opportunity to interact and grow in moral character and intellectual honesty as the sins of the past are put to rest, in the reciprocal objective of creating a mature society based upon mutual respect.</p>
<p>However, respect needs to be earned and is not an intrinsic ingredient automatically granted to every cultural social mind-set.</p>
<p>Individuals have the ability to make choices. Choosing civilization over barbarianism is within the grasps of any sincere and ethically committed person.</p>
<p>This object of civilized unity builds a future for the greatest numbers. Recognizing that deliberate induced racial animosity has a profound political purpose is essential to understand the motives behind distorted news reporting and the progressive policy agenda that seeks to conquer by dividing the different factions, which populate the country.</p>
<p>Reformist activism, usually portrayed as shaping government programs that provide for &#8220;so called&#8221; well-intentioned coercive laws and regulations, is the media narrative that insults the intelligence of any thinking person.</p>

No better example of this televised psychosomatic pollution that inflicts a national disease of artificial guilt is MSNBC. The notorious medicine-man dispenser of this kind of poison is <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1816884/posts">Al Sharpton</a>. The Reverend has a long record of demeaning his own brothers and sisters by bring new meaning to the term, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffir_(racial_term)">Kaffir</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/07/report-sharpton-invokes-race-215-times-on-his-show-in-2013/">The Daily Caller</a>, political reporter Caroline May cites Sharpton’s consistent race baiting tirades.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;MSNBC host Reverend Al Sharpton invoked race over 200 times last year, <a href="http://www.mrc.org/articles/racy-rev-msnbcs-sharpton-mentions-race-215-times-13">according to a new tally</a> by the conservative Media Research Center.</p>
<p>According to the analysis by Katie Yoder the liberal host said &#8220;race,&#8221; &#8220;racism,&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221; 215 times in 2013 during his MSNBC show PoliticsNation.</p>
<p>&#8220;From opposition to the Obama agenda to guns and even into fashion and food, Sharpton’s finely tuned nose for racism rarely took a day off last year,&#8221; Yoder wrote.</p>
<p>In an example the MRC notes that Sharpton was able to invoke race five times in a single paragraph about Republican attacks on Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in January, John Daly on <a href="http://www.bernardgoldberg.com/">bernardgoldberg.com</a>, publishes the account, <a href="http://www.bernardgoldberg.com/msnbc-twitterer-fired/">MSNBC Twitterer Fired for Race Baiting</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On Wednesday night, conservatives honed in on offensive tweet that appeared on MSNBC’s official Twitter feed. The full tweet read, &#8220;Maybe the rightwing will hate it, but everyone else will go awww: the adorable new #Cheerios ad w/biracial family.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The comment was in reference a new television commercial for Cheerios entitled &#8220;Gracie&#8221; that features a biracial family enjoying a breakfast conversation at their kitchen table. The implication by the MSNBC employee behind the tweet, of course, was that the rightwing in this country is racist, and therefore they would surely be disgusted by the visual scene of a family with one white parent and one black parent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of the story included that other mainstay of race politics and self-reproach apologist, Chris Mathews. The Hardball <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/18/chris_matthews_to_black_msnbc_employee_on_race_im_speaking_now_for_all_white_people_im_sorry.html/looid=NlZTRmZDrkzdU7qFfooL0uqE2HK8UJn-">video</a>, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/18/chris_matthews_to_black_msnbc_employee_on_race_im_speaking_now_for_all_white_people_im_sorry.html">Matthews To Black Guest On Race</a>: &#8220;I&#8217;m Speaking Now For All White People&#8230; I&#8217;m Sorry&#8221;, is a pitiful testimony.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We got to continue this conversation, gentlemen, privately and on television. I mean a lot of people out there &#8212; I&#8217;ll just tell you one thing. And I&#8217;m speaking now for all white people, but especially people who have had to try to change the last 50 or 60 years. And they &#8212; a lot of them have really tried to change, and I&#8217;m sorry for this stuff. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="chrismatthews.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/chrismatthews.jpg" align="Left" /><br />
Tom Borelli, writes in the Liberty Alliance - <a href="http://libertyalliance.com/2013/11/msnbc-chris-matthews-wild-race-card-attack-conservatives/">MSNBC Chris Matthews Wild Race Card Attack Against Conservatives</a>, more from this self-anointed supporter and barker for liberal delusional bigotry.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In his foaming rant, Matthews claims voter I.D. laws are like poll taxes with the goal to suppress black voters and he adds Obama’s political opposition are the enemy that gain from hate:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Obama’s true enemies are those who back the three dozen states now pushing voter suppression laws to make damn sure the country doesn’t go and elect another black president, or a progressive white president. You know this generation’s equivalent of poll taxes and those discredited literacy tests anything to keep minorities from their voting rights. And to this crowd the Obama haters add to them those who gnaw on the president’s health care bill with the hunger of starving rats but offer nothing in its place except their crazed notions about bringing down the government and destroying the county’s economic stature even as they deny even a penny of credit to the president for the zooming American stock market right now. These are the enemies those who stand and benefit from all the anger and hatred and indecency of the nasty right…&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Matthews is once again proving MSNBC is not a news organization but a cable outlet for political operatives whose goal is to spread progressive propaganda.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So does this party line programming, emphasizing a racially slanted mantra, which drives wedges among the viewing public, actually help ratings? The <a href="https://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/nov-2013-ratings-chris-matthews-is-tops-for-msnbc_b205172">TVNewser</a> lists that MSNBC was down across the board compared to Nov. 2012. However, MSNBC ranked #1 among African-American viewers in both A25-54 and total viewers in all key dayparts and MSNBC ranked #1 among Hispanic viewers A25-54 in M-F primetime and M-Su primetime.<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/monday-cable-news-ratings-sharpton-1-in-demo-on-msnbc/">Mediaite</a> lists Sharpton #1 in Demo on MSNBC. Especially review the chart TV NEWS RATINGS: 25-54 DEMOGRAPHIC comparing with the other cable news networks.</p>
<blockquote><p>PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton was the highest-rated show in the 25-54 demo across MSNBC’s evening schedule Monday with 214K viewers. Sharpton beat fellow MSNBC hosts Chris Matthews, who had 209K viewers and Ed Schultz, who had 170K.</p>
<p>Matthews was #1 in total viewers on MSNBC with 844K, followed by Rachel Maddow with 729K and Schultz with 717K.</p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/03/18/pew-study-finds-msnbc-the-most-opinionated-cable-news-channel-by-far/">Pew Study Finds MSNBC the Most Opinionated Cable News Channel By Far</a>, &#8220;A full 85% of the Comcast-owned network’s coverage can be classified as opinion or commentary rather than straight news, according to the authors of the Pew Research Center’s annual State of the News Media report.&#8221;</p>
<p>The significance of this data is that the gap between minority identified and 25-54 viewers and all America is increasing even wider. With the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/02/2013-cable-news-ratings-msnbc-cnn_n_4532020.html">2013 Cable News Ratings</a>: Fox News Sees Sharp Demo Decline, CNN Suffers In Primetime. The race baiters at MSNBC seems to have consolidated their niche among targeted minorities and the products of the more recent government school educated and MTV generation.Decades of liberalizing news distortion and manufactured false re-invention of history has produced a total disconnect from reality. MSNBC is used as a poster boy network for shutting out serious journalism from the medium, but it is almost impossible to find any mainstream broadcasts that are worthy of viewership.</p>
<p>There is a profound reason why the stuck on stupid culture is all around us. Open and rational political debate and discourse is slated for complete removal from television. Anyone who can seriously admit being a MSNBC viewer has deep seeded issues of reckoning sane behavior.</p>
<p>Those limousine liberals love to champion abortion as a well-tested solution of reducing population. Minorities, particularly targeted for marginalization, need to rebel against the democratic politicians and liberal class perversion, whereby <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/nyc-more-black-babies-killed-abortion-born">NYC: More Black Babies Killed by Abortion Than Born</a>. For those who gain a foothold on life, the media brainwashing of the likes of Rev. Al await.Fools who drink from the cup of their own racial genocide are their own worst enemy. The national interest demands that exploitation of race as a substitute for intelligent co-existence end. Compulsory Integration or miscegenation leveling has proven a massive failure. Is it not time that all tribes start a respectful dialogue and abandon the shackles of blaming race discrimination for the general failure of society? Separation by race is natural. This fact is a news topic that serious media and journalists need to address.</p>

<p>These are an extremely pivotal few days from the standpoint of international political economy and the Ukrainian crisis.</p>
<p>Last minute diplomatic talks in London between Russia and the USSA over the Ukrainian crisis <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/14/russia-west-collision-course-ukraine-talks-fail-london" target="_blank">failed on Friday</a>, and USSA Secretary of State, John Kerry,<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/mar/13/john-kerry-us-will-step-in-crimea-referendum-video" target="_blank">has delivered an ultimatum to Russia</a> — if the outcome of the Crimean referendum on Sunday is not to the liking of the USSA government then Washington, DC and its European allies will take a series of further, serious, unspecified, retaliatory measures on Monday.</p>
<p>These threatened measures are widely expected to include a range of financial sanctions. The whiff of a possible NATO/ USSA war with Russia is also in the air. The negative consequences of a NATO/ USSA military clash with Russia include the very real threat of a nuclear conflict, since both sides are very heavily armed with a full array of nuclear ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, torpedoes and bombs.</p>
<p>China has viewed the rapidly developing crisis with a thoroughly jaundiced eye and has warned against sanctions by the USSA against Russia due to the “<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/the-tiger-awakens-china-warns-of-retaliatory-action-and-unforeseeable-consequences-over-u-s-monday-deadline_03142014" target="_blank">unforeseeable consequences</a>” and “<a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/the-tiger-awakens-china-warns-of-retaliatory-action-and-unforeseeable-consequences-over-u-s-monday-deadline_03142014" target="_blank">retaliatory action</a>” that such sanctions might engender.</p>
<p>Given that China holds $1.3 trillion of the USSA’s government debt, which it could willy-nilly dump, with disastrous effects on the American economy, and also has a full brace of nuclear missiles that can reach the USSA mainland and its numerous military bases in the Pacific region, the warning is not an empty threat. Here is a photo of a <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Aar9BmR-K_w/Ue8YidOsU2I/AAAAAAAAbPU/o1INkc9TA2M/s1600/Type+094+Jin+Class+Nuclear-Powered+Ballistic+Missile+Submarines+%28SSBN%29launched+test+fired+fully+operational+next+year+with+their+JL-2+submarine-launched+ballistic+missiles+%28SLBMs%29096097095092a+%282%29.jpg" target="_blank">Chinese “boomer”</a>laden with nuclear missiles headed out to sea.</p>
<p>Indeed, in anticipation of probable anti-Russian sanctions Russian financial institutions have already begun pulling vast sums of money out of the West, including some <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/14/russia-us-treasury-bill-bonds-ukraine-sanctions" target="_blank">$105 billion out of the USSA this week alone</a>.</p>
<p>This takes place in the context of <a href="http://wakeupfromyourslumber.com/news/russian-jets-stage-exercises-over-mediterranean" target="_blank">Russian carrier-based jets staging war exercises</a> in the eastern Mediterranean, flying from the deck of the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, near Cyprus. This is also near Israel, off the coast of Syria. The message could not be clearer that Russia intends to stand by its long-time ally Syria, at the same time that it sends a cautionary message to Israel. It is fair to assume that the Kuznetsov battle group is carrying nuclear weapons, as do USSA aircraft carrier battle groups.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the Pentagon has announced that the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/14/us-ukraine-crisis-pentagon-idUSBREA2D1D820140314" target="_blank">aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush will be remaining in the Mediterranean a few more days</a> due to the crisis in Ukraine. Also today, Russian self-defense forces in Crimea announced the capture of an American military drone that was surveiling the peninsula.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Crimeans will most likely vote to join the Russian Federation. If they do, the following day the USSA government will announce punitive measures against Russia. After that, the Russians and Chinese will take whatever steps they feel are appropriate, and then the USSA government and its allies will take further steps in response.</p>
<p>This entire scenario is fraught with profound peril for the whole world. I don’t know what is going to happen, but a hard shock to the global financial system, in the coming days and weeks, appears highly possible.</p>
<p>The more so as financial astrologers are unanimously pointing to April 2014 (next month) as being a period of <a href="http://www.zentrader.ca/blog/?p=22150" target="_blank">financial crisis for the USSA economy and its so-called “Federal Reserve Bank.”</a> I am not a financial astrologer, but I have to say that their prognostications are right on the money. April is shaping up to be a period of intense crisis for the USSA and its financial system.</p>
<p>I do not presume that in a war with Russia and China, be it a nuclear exchange or a financial showdown, that the USSA and its European allies will necessarily prevail. J.P. Morgan, the early-20th century Robber Baron, famously said that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/02/20/can-planets-affect-your-portfolio/" target="_blank">millionaires do not have astrologers, but billionaires do</a>. For millennia, kings, queens, emperors, and now presidents, premiers and prime ministers, have been consulting astrologers. I would be very surprised if the Chinese and Russians do not take full advantage of the propitious astrology of April 2014 to take the USSA government and the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank down a peg.</p>
<p>Though I am not a financial adviser, it does seem prudent to me for people who are aware of the confusion that is coming to use the period of time right now to prepare for future contingencies that may arrive within mere weeks. If the USSA financial system crashes hard, and that possibility realistically exists, then the American dollar is going to lose value, perhaps a great deal of value, and most of the world will feel the effects.</p>
<p>Paper currency, any paper currency, becomes just paper when enough people lose confidence in its value. Historically, silver and gold have held their value across thousands of years. I do not have any gold and silver, or platinum, palladium or rhodium, either. <a href="http://libertygoldandsilver.com/" target="_blank">But if I were financially able I would certainly obtain some and take physical possession of it</a>. I would do it this very day. We are entering a period of high uncertainty right now and no one knows how long it will last, or how severe the crisis may become. One thing is certain: those who are least prepared, physically, psychologically, emotionally, spiritually, financially, socially, etc. will fare the worst.</p>
<p>So get ready.</p>

</div>
<p>There Is A Great Risk of WWIII Over Ukraine / Crimea. But it could be avoided if Russia and China act fast, dumping their dollar reserves, breaking the US dollar, thereby breaking the US economy.They don&#8217;t need all of the BRICS for that.</p>
<p>Mr. Putin knows it, Mr. Xi knows it and Mr. Obama knows it &#8211; that Washington is holding the shorter stick.</p>
<p>What do the gentlemen Putin and Xi wait for? </p>
<p>For more brazen actions by Washington and its European lackeys and puppets?</p>
<p>It’s already widely known that the<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article37929.htm"> snipers in Kiev</a> who killed almost 100 people were mercenaries paid for and were following US orders – straight from the US embassy in Kiev.</p>
<p>Blackwater and other US mercenaries – proxy armies &#8211; are roaming the streets of Kiev and other Ukrainian western cities who have indicated their desire to stay allied with Russia.</p>
<p>Mr. Putin knows it. </p>
<p>What else is needed to show the empire and its marionettes that they are naked? That they will be severely hurt if they follow Obama&#8217;s and the Pentagon’s unconscious war cries? – If they continue to allow the presstitute media to numb their brains?</p>
<p>Why doesn’t Russia start ‘sampling’ what it could do? Like cutting of gas supplies to Europe – for starters? That seems to be easy enough.</p>
<p>Of course, Washington needs wars not only to reach global hegemony, but also for its mickey-mouse economy to survive; this hell-bound military / security industrial economy that produces about 60% of the US GDP – plus the endless production of unbacked dollars not worth the paper they are printed on – debt that is bought the world over in the form of Treasury Bonds as reserve currency – which is the driver of the American economy’s (sic) senseless consumerism – accounting for almost the reminder of US economic output.</p>
<p>What would be easier than to cut the world lose from this strangling chain – and send Washington and its stooges down the drain of national bankruptcy? </p>
<p>And starting a new segment of civilization, a new currency, a basket of moneys from sound and healthy economies? </p>
<p>There are plenty of countries who would like to participate in such a new beginning, even if the BRICS cannot get their act together fast enough &#8212; Vietnam, Malaysia, Iran, Venezuela with the planet’s largest known hydrocarbon reserves – as well as Central Asian and other hydrocarbon producers.</p>
<p>The world populations may have to go through some dry stretches and trying periods – but would come out of it as winners – happy winners of a fairer global economy, where long-lost national sovereignties would be reinstated, with new partnerships and with of a new sense of human and societal solidarity.</p>
<p>Very likely, the presstitute, the propaganda whores of today’s linchpins would want to switch seats to side with the ‘winners’, as they imagine it’s with them that new lucre is waiting.</p>
<p>Wrong. These media criminals, who have millions of lives – or deaths &#8211; on their spineless backs, would be shed, floored, ignored annihilated. </p>
<p>New and truth journalism would flourish, instead.</p>
<p>Why is it so difficult to imagine such a new-born and healthy world? – And act on it fast? &#8211; Before our hapless humanity allows to be self-destroyed by a nuclear WWIII?</p>

<blockquote><p>“The crimes of the United States have been systematic, constant, vicious, remorseless, but very few people have actually talked about them. You have to hand it to America. It has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good.” - <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article11239.htm">Harold Pinter, Nobel Acceptance Speech</a></p>
<p>“Obama is just a willing executioner. From the ruling class’s point of view, he’s the perfect figurehead because his mere appearance confuses and disarms so many. He seems to have spent his whole life trying to get chosen to play Judas. And that’s all there is in his resume.” -bevin, Comments line, Moon of Alabama</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a newly-released <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304250204579433533118580224?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll</a>, Barack Obama’s job-approval ratings have dipped to a new low of 41 percent with a full 54 percent of respondents saying they “disapproved” of the job he’s doing. Obama’s handling of the economy, health care and foreign policy were particular areas of concern for most respondents. On health care, Obama is seen as having strengthened the for-profit insurance industry with little benefit for ordinary working people. The survey also showed “the lowest-ever approval” for the president’s handling of foreign policy. And, on the economy, the results were even more shocking; a full 57% of the people polled “believe the U.S. is still in a recession” while “65 percent think the country is on the wrong track”. Widespread disappointment in Obama’s performance has weakened his support among blacks, Hispanics and women, traditionally, the most loyal groups in the Party’s base.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that Obama has been hurt by the anemic recovery or by focusing on deficit reduction instead of job creation. High unemployment, flat wages and shrinking incomes have weighed heavily on expectations, which has put a damper on consumption and growth. Gallup’s Economic Confidence index now shows a “sharp decline in the outlook for the future” …”with some 57 percent of the respondents saying things are getting worse, not better.”</p>
<p>Indeed, things have gotten worse under Obama, much worse, which is why many of his most ardent supporters are falling off the bandwagon. And the disappointment is not limited to economic policy either. Recent surveys confirm what most people already know, that the public is tired of the interventions, the provocations, the meddling and the endless wars. The American people are increasingly isolationist and want the government to disengage from foreign conflicts. Here’s an excerpt from a recent survey by PEW that sums up the mood of the country:</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the first time since 1964, more than half (52%) agree that the U.S. should “mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own;” 38% disagree, according to a survey conducted Oct.-Nov. 2013. Similarly, 80% agree with the statement, “We should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems and building up our strength and prosperity here at home.” (<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/key-data-points/u-s-foreign-policy-key-data-points/" target="_blank">U.S. Foreign Policy: Key Data Points from Pew Research</a>, PEW Research Center)</p></blockquote>
<p>The PEW poll merely expands on the findings in other surveys like this from the LA Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Two thirds of Americans questioned in a recent poll said the 12-year war fought in Afghanistan…hasn’t been worth the price paid in lives and dollars…</p>
<p>The survey conducted for the media by Langer Research Associates of New York found that disillusionment with the U.S.-led war was expressed by a majority of all political leanings. Overall, 66% of respondents said the war hasn’t been worth it. Those who identified themselves as liberals were most unhappy with the military investment: 78% said the war was a mistake.” (<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/20/world/la-fg-wn-afghanistan-war-support-poll-20131220" target="_blank">Poll: Two thirds of Americans say Afghan war not worth fighting</a>, LA Times)</p></blockquote>
<p>The same is true of Iraq. The war wasn’t worth fighting. Check this out on ABC News:</p>
<p>“Ten years after U.S. airstrikes on Baghdad punctuated the start of the Iraq war, nearly six in 10 Americans say the war was not worth fighting – a judgment shared by majorities steadily since initial success gave way to years of continued conflict.</p>
<p>Nearly as many in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll say the same about the war in Afghanistan. And while criticisms of both wars are down from their peaks, the intensity of sentiment remains high, with strong critics far outweighing strong supporters.” (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/03/a-decade-on-most-are-critical-of-the-u-s-led-war-in-iraq/" target="_blank">A Decade on, Most are Critical of the U.S.-Led War in Iraq</a>, ABC News)</p>
<p>And that brings us to today and the looming prospect of a war with Russia over developments in the Crimea. Here’s what people are thinking according to a survey in the Washington Post:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A new poll suggests Americans have very little appetite for any real involvement in the crisis in Ukraine. Only 29 percent of Americans would like for the Obama administration to take a ‘firm stand’ against Russia’s incursion into its neighbor, according to the Pew Research Center poll, while nearly twice as many — 56 percent — prefer the United States not to get too involved in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The poll reflects a war-weary American public that is still very reticent to get involved in international conflicts. The American people were similarly opposed to military intervention in Syria last year, despite President Obama calling for the use of force and seeking congressional approval for action.” (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/03/11/few-americans-want-firm-stand-against-russia-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">Few Americans want ‘firm stand’ against Russia in Ukraine</a>, Washington Post)</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Obama doesn’t care the American people want. He’s going to do what he signed-on to do; crack down on civil liberties, strangle the economy, and spread war across the planet. As far as the warmongering goes–he’s doing an even better job than Bush. Don’t believe me? Just check out this clip from the International Business Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In their annual End of Year poll, researchers for WIN and Gallup International surveyed more than 66,000 people across 65 nations and found that 24 percent of all respondents answered that the United States “is the greatest threat to peace in the world today.” Pakistan and China fell significantly behind the United States on the poll, with 8 and 6 percent, respectively.” (<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/gallup-poll-biggest-threat-world-peace-america-1525008" target="_blank">In Gallup Poll, The Biggest Threat To World Peace Is… America?</a>, IBT)</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it, the Obama presidency in a nutshell: “The United States is the greatest threat to peace in the world today.” Keep in mind, this survey wasn’t taken during the Bush years. Oh no. This is all Obama’s doing, every bit of it.</p>
<p>Let’s summarize: The majority of Americans think Obama is doing a lousy job. They think the economy stinks, and they think their financial situation is getting worse. They also think the country is on the wrong track, that America is a threat to world peace, and that they don’t want anymore goddamned wars.</p>
<p>Check, check, check, check and check.</p>
<p>So, what do you think the Obama administration’s reaction to this public outpouring has been?</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what it’s been. They’re happy. That’s right, they’re happy. Despite the plunging poll numbers and dwindling public support, the Obama team feels vindicated by the fact that they’re not as widely reviled as the Bush administration. That’s their benchmark: Bush. And they could be on to something too, after all, who would have thought that a president could repeal habeas corpus, destroy the economy, launch wars and coups like they’re going out of style, vaporize hundreds of innocent people in drone attacks, intensify surveillance on every man, woman and child in the United States, and claim the right to assassinate US citizens without due process, without inciting millions of enraged Americans to grab their pitchforks and head to Washington?</p>
<p>That’s what would have happened if Bush was still in office, right? But Obama gets a “pass”. Why? Because he’s an articulate, charismatic black man who the vast majority of Dems still admire. Can you believe it?</p>
<p>Obama represents everything these people profess to hate–war, drone attacks, Gitmo, austerity, Wall Street (no prosecutions), indefinite detention, executive privilege (to assassinate) etc–and yet they still put the man on a pedestal. Which is why we think that Obama is the greatest public relations invention of all-time; a beaming, exuberant, galvanic paragon who embodies all the laudatory characteristics of leadership and who–at the same time– is able to carry out the most despicable, inhuman acts without the slightest hesitation or remorse. He is man who feels nothing towards his fellow human beings, neither empathy, compassion, or mercy. What matters to Obama is that he faithfully follow the script that’s been written for him by his miscreant handlers, that odious amalgam of cutthroat corporatists, bank mandarins and loafing ivy league silver-spooners who make up America’s iniquitous Kleptocracy. The best description of Obama I’ve ever read was in the comments section of a foreign policy blogsite called Moon of Alabama by a blogger named “bevin”. Here’s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think that Obama is completely empty of scruples…just a willing executioner. From the ruling class’s point of view he is the perfect figurehead because his mere appearance confuses and disarms so many. He seems to have spent his whole life trying to get chosen to play Judas. And that is all there is in his resume…</p>
<p>They present him as negligent, never responsible, never intentionally connected to an evil act, never drawn into the acts of duplicity by a conscious intent. This is the false image, the disinformation projected about who he is…</p>
<p>It strikes me that Obama is all those things. And that this is the core of the evil in him- that he is without conscience or principle, just an ordinary butcher going about his business, fulfilling the terms of his employment, doing what he was asked to do…</p>
<p>You see him as focused and intentional.</p>
<p>I see him as someone who will sign a stack of death warrants without reading them, or thinking about them again. Remember just after November 2008, waiting to take office, how the Israelis attacked Gaza, obviously to show him who is boss? Didn’t you sense that even they were surprised at the insouciance with which he watched those extraordinary massacres pass before his eyes?</p>
<p>He didn’t care. And he was, at last, relieved of the chore of pretending that he did care about such things.</p>
<p>That’s really what he likes about being President: he can relax while the killing goes on, he doesn’t need to pretend it bothers him, he doesn’t need to pass any kind of moral judgment.</p>
<p>Remember when he asked his step-father “Have you ever killed men?”</p>
<p>The reply he got was “Only men who were weak.”</p>
<p>He has adhered to that moral standard ever since.” (bevin, Moon of Alabama)</p></blockquote>
<p>That perfectly summarizes the man; an empty gourd who never had any intention of fulfilling his promises, who has utter disdain for the fools that voted for him, and who finds it as easy to kill a man, his family and his kids, as to swat a fly on his forearm. As bevin notes Obama “is a pure confidence man and a sociopath.”</p>
<p>And now the sociopath has focused his attention on Ukraine where he’s determined to draw Russia into a conflict over the Crimea even though Moscow has assisted the US in the War on Terror, removed its heavy weapons from the Western part of Russia, reduced its conventional military by 300,000 troops, and fulfilled all its obligations under the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces Treaty in Europe (ACAF).</p>
<p>Moscow has done everything that was asked of it. And what has Washington done in return. Here’s how Valentin Mândrăşescu, Editor of The Voice of Russia’s Reality Check, sums it up on the Testosterone Pit website:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Washington has defaulted on all of its key agreements made with USSR/Russia during the last 30 years. Gorbachev was promised that Eastern Europe would not be taken into NATO. Country by country became part of NATO and Yugoslavia was dismantled despite Russia’s objections. The US acted as the winner of the Cold War and guided its policies by the famous principle of “Vae victis!” Woe to the vanquished!” (Valentin Mândrăşescu, Editor of The Voice of Russia’s Reality Check, <a href="http://www.testosteronepit.com/home/2014/3/10/from-now-on-no-compromises-are-possible-for-russia.html" target="_blank">From now on, No compromises are possible with Russia</a>, Testosterone Pit)</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the US has surrounded Russia with military bases, trained troops in Georgia that were eventually used to fight Russia in South Ossetia, instigated numerous color-coded revolutions in former Soviet states, and started to deploy a missile defense system in Eastern Europe that will give Washington first-strike nuclear weapons capability that will destroy “the strategic equilibrium in the world” and force Putin to resume the arms race.</p>
<p>That’s how Washington makes friends; by stomping their face into the pavement every chance it gets. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Obama met with Ukraine’s imposter prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, at the White House in a attempt to lend credibility to the coup leader’s Nazi-strew government. Obama used the White House event to applaud the putsch and to promise support for the aggressively anti-Kremlin government. Shortly after Obama finished his statement, blogsites released copies of a resolution that was issued by the European Parliament just 15 months earlier condemning the groups which are now part of the US-backed Ukrainian government. Here’s a blurb from the text of that resolution:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The European Parliament…Is concerned about the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine, expressed in support for the Svoboda Party, which, as a result, is one of the two new parties to enter the Verkhovna Rada; recalls that racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic views go against the EU’s fundamental values and principles and therefore appeals to pro-democratic parties in the Verkhovna Rada not to associate with, endorse or form coalitions with this party.” (<a href="http://www.moonofalabama.org/2014/03/ukraine-eu-parliament-warns-of-association-with-svoboda.html#comments" target="_blank">Moon of Alabama</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>How do you like that? So the European Parliament saw the danger of these groups and denounced them before they had a change of heart and realized that these died-in-the-wool, neo-Nazi, jackboot-thugs might be able to help them advance their foreign policy objectives. Now the EU nations are lining up behind Obama who’s doing his level-best to provoke Putin so he can push NATO to Russia’s borders, take control of critical pipeline corridors and vital resources, and install weapons systems on Russia’s perimeter. These are the administration’s goals despite the threat they pose to democracy, security, and regional stability, not to mention the possibility of a third world war.</p>
<p>Bottom line: You don’t get to be “the greatest threat to world peace” without really applying yourself.</p>
<p>Obama wants to prove he’s up to the task. Regrettably, we think he is.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We are witnessing a huge geopolitical game in which the aim is the destruction of Russia as a geopolitical opponent of the US or of the global financial oligarchy…..The realization of this project is in line with the concept of global domination that is being carried out by the US.”</p>
<p>- Vladimir Yakunin, former Russian senior diplomat</p>
<p>“History shows that wherever the U.S. meddles; chaos and misery are soon to follow.”</p>
<p>- Kalithea, comments line, Moon of Alabama</p></blockquote>
<p>Following a 13 year rampage that has reduced large swathes of Central Asia and the Middle East to anarchy and ruin, the US military juggernaut has finally met its match on a small peninsula in southeastern Ukraine that serves as the primary operating base for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Crimea is the door through which Washington must pass if it intends to extend its forward-operating bases throughout Eurasia, seize control of vital pipeline corridors and resources, and establish itself as the dominant military/economic power-player in the new century. Unfortunately, for Washington, Moscow has no intention of withdrawing from the Crimea or relinquishing control of its critical military outpost in Sevastopol. That means that the Crimea–which has been invaded by the Cimmerians, Bulgars, Greeks, Scythians, Goths, Huns, Khazars, Ottomans, Turks, Mongols, and Germans–could see another conflagration in the months ahead, perhaps, triggering a Third World War, the collapse of the existing global security structure, and a new world order, albeit quite different from the one imagined by the fantasists at the Council on Foreign Relations and the other far-right think tanks that guide US foreign policy and who are responsible for the present crisis.</p>
<p>How Washington conducts itself in this new conflict will tell us whether the authors of the War on Terror–that public relations hoax that concealed the goals of eviscerated civil liberties and one world government–were really serious about actualizing their NWO vision or if it was merely the collective pipedream of corporate CEOs and bored bankers with too much time on their hands. In the Crimea, the empire faces a real adversary, not a disparate group of Kalashinov-waving jihadis in flip-flops. This is the Russian Army; they know how to defend themselves and they are prepared to do so. That puts the ball in Obama’s court. It’s up to him and his crackpot “Grand Chessboard” advisors to decide how far they want to push this. Do they want to intensify the rhetoric and ratchet up the sanctions until blows are exchanged, or pick up their chips and walk away before things get out of hand? Do they want to risk it all on one daredevil roll of the dice or move on to Plan B? That’s the question. Whatever US policymakers decide, one thing is certain, Moscow is not going to budge. Their back is already against the wall. Besides, they know that a lunatic with a knife is on the loose, and they’re ready to do whatever is required to protect their people. If Washington decides to cross that line and provoke a fight, then there’s going to trouble. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Perma-hawk, John McCain thinks that Obama should take off the gloves and show Putin who’s boss. In an interview with TIME magazine McCain said “This is a chess match reminiscent of the Cold War and we need to realize that and act accordingly…We need to take certain measures that would convince Putin that there is a very high cost to actions that he is taking now.”</p>
<p>“High cost” says McCain, but high cost for who?</p>
<p>What McCain fails to realize is that this is not Afghanistan and Obama is not in a spitting match with puppet Karzai. Leveling sanctions against Moscow will have significant consequences, the likes of which could cause real harm to US interests. Did we mention that “ExxonMobil’s biggest non-US oil project is a collaboration with Russia’s Rosneft in the Arctic, where it has billions of dollars of investments at stake.” What if Putin decides that it’s no longer in Moscow’s interest to honor contracts that were made with US corporations? What do you think the reaction of shareholders will be to that news? And that’s just one example. There are many more.</p>
<p>Any confrontation with Russia will result in asymmetrical attacks on the dollar, the bond market, and oil supplies. Maybe the US could defeat Russian forces in the Crimea. Maybe they could sink the fleet and rout the troops, but there’ll be a heavy price to pay and no one will be happy with the outcome. Here’s a clip from an article at Testosterone Pit that sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sergei Glazyev, the most hardline of Putin’s advisors, sketched the retaliation strategy: Drop the dollar, sell US Treasuries, encourage Russian companies to default on their dollar-denominated debts, and create an alternative currency system with the BRICS and hydrocarbon producers like Venezuela and Iran…</p>
<p>Putin’s ally and trusted friend, Rosneft president Igor Sechin…suggested that it was “advisable to create an international stock-exchange for the participating countries, where transactions could be registered with the use of regional currencies.” (<a href="http://www.testosteronepit.com/home/2014/3/10/from-now-on-no-compromises-are-possible-for-russia.html">From Now On, No Compromises Are Possible For Russia</a>, Testosterone Pit)</p></blockquote>
<p>As the US continues to abuse its power, these changes become more and more necessary. Foreign governments must form new alliances in order to abandon the present system–the “dollar system”–and establish greater parity between nation-states, the very nation-states that Washington is destroying one-by-one to establish its ghoulish vision of global corporate utopia. The only way to derail that project is by exposing the glaring weakness in the system itself, which is the use of an international currency that is backed by $15 trillion in government debt, $4 trillion in Federal Reserve debt, and trillions more in unpaid and unpayable federal obligations. Whatever steps Moscow takes to abort the current system and replace the world’s reserve currency with money that represents a fair store of value, should be applauded. Washington’s reckless and homicidal behavior around the world make it particularly unsuitable as the de facto steward of the global financial system or to enjoy seigniorage, which allows the US to play banker to the rest of the world. The dollar is the foundation upon which rests the three pillars of imperial strength; political, economic and military. Remove that foundation and the entire edifice comes crashing to earth. Having abused that power, by killing and maiming millions of people across the planet; the world needs to transition to another, more benign way of consummating its business transactions, preferably a currency that is not backed by the blood and misery of innocent victims. Paul Volcker summed up the feelings of many dollar-critics in 2010 when he had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The growing sense around much of the world is that we have lost both relative economic strength and more important, we have lost a coherent successful governing model to be emulated by the rest of the world. Instead, we’re faced with broken financial markets, underperformance of our economy and a fractious political climate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>America is irreparably broken and Washington is a moral swamp. The world needs regime change; new leaders, new direction and a different system.</p>
<p>In our last article, we tried to draw attention to the role of big oil in the present crisis. Author Nafeez Ahmed expands on that theme in a “must read” article in Monday’s Guardian. Check out this brief excerpt from Ahmed’s piece titled “Ukraine crisis is about Great Power oil, gas pipeline rivalry”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ukraine is increasingly perceived to be critically situated in the emerging battle to dominate energy transport corridors linking the oil and natural gas reserves of the Caspian basin to European markets… Considerable competition has already emerged over the construction of pipelines. Whether Ukraine will provide alternative routes helping to diversify access, as the West would prefer, or ‘find itself forced to play the role of a Russian subsidiary,’ remains to be seen.” (Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>The western oil giants have been playing “catch up” for more than a decade with Putin checkmating them at every turn. As it happens, the wily KGB alum has turned out to be a better businessman than any of his competitors, essentially whooping them at their own game, using the free market to extend his network of pipelines across Central Asia and into Europe. That’s what the current crisis is all about. Big Oil came up “losers” in the resource war so now they want Uncle Sam to apply some muscle to put them back in the game. It’s called “sour grapes”, which refers to the whining that people do when they got beat fair and square. Here’s more from Ahmed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To be sure, the violent rioting was triggered by frustration with (Ukrainian President) Yanukovych’s rejection of the EU deal, (in favor of Putin’s sudden offer of a 30% cheaper gas bill and a $15 billion aid package) along with rocketing energy, food and other consumer bills, linked to Ukraine’s domestic gas woes ….. Police brutality to suppress what began as peaceful demonstrations was the last straw…” (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/06/ukraine-crisis-great-power-oil-gas-rivals-pipelines">Ukraine crisis is about Great Power oil, gas pipeline rivalry</a>, Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Yanukovych rejected an offer from Chevron that the EU and Washington were pushing, and went with the sweeter deal from Russia. According to Ahmed, that pissed off the bigwigs who decided to incite the rioting. (“Putin’s sudden offer of a 30% cheaper gas bill and a $15 billion aid package provoked the protests…”)</p>
<p>Like we said before; it’s just a case of sour grapes.</p>
<p>So, tell me, dear reader: Is this the first time you’ve heard a respected analyst say that oil was behind the rioting, the coup, and the confrontation with Moscow?</p>
<p>I’ll bet it is. Whatever tentacles Wall Street may have wrapped around the White House, Capital Hill, and the US judiciary; Big Oil still rules the roost. The Apostles of the Fossil are the oldest and most powerful club in Washington, and “What they say, goes”. As Ahmed so articulately points out:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Resource scarcity, competition to dominate Eurasian energy corridors, are behind Russian militarism and US interference…Ukraine is caught hapless in the midst of this accelerating struggle to dominate Eurasia’s energy corridors in the last decades of the age of fossil fuels.” (“Ukraine crisis is about Great Power oil, gas pipeline rivalry”, Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I hear someone say “Resource War”?</p>
<p>As we noted in an earlier article, NWO mastermind Zbigniew Brzezinski characterized the conflict with Russia in terms of cutting off “Western access to the Caspian Sea and Central Asia”. For some unknown reason, America’s behemoth oil corporations think the resources that lie beneath Russian soil belong to them. The question is whether their agents will push Obama to put American troops at risk to assert that claim. If they do, there’s going to be a war.</p>

<p>Flag waving Americans want to believe that their government is on the right side of history. Especially in the realm of foreign policy, the myth that the United States saved the world from despotic tyrants, popularly reflected in the victor’s account of post World War II, is the accepted viewpoint. Hidden from public education is that the <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/121202.html">New World Order</a> was the actual winner. The specific inception of the globalist forces that originated the <em>sub rosa</em> directions behind formable institutions and governments dates well back over centuries. However, the modern technocratic era allows for the dramatic acceleration of a one-world system imposition, which was never possible in previous times.</p>
<p>Loyal citizens of the old republic want to trust that the State Department, commissioned to serve as the guardian and protector of the country, is conducting foreign policy in the best interests of the nation. There is a reason why the Secretary of State is third in line to succeed the President. That purpose, intended to defend diplomatically and promote the public safety and benefit, has served a very different master for a very long time.</p>
<p>Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg’s notorious adage, &#8220;politics stops at the water&#8217;s edge&#8221;, by no means ever really practiced by the political class a true national defense of the country because it was never the primary goal of the establishment.</p>
<p>The international corporate conglomerate of economic dominance sets the agenda for the imperium empire that deploys the worldwide military hegemony, which feeds upon endless manufactured conflicts and false flag operations. The State Department is the keeper of the keys that formulate policies, which serves only the globalist patrons that control the puppets who make up the federal bureaucracies.</p>
<p>The successors of the sinister cabal that planned World War I and II and created Hitler, Stalin and Mao Zedong are the same prodigy that dictates the constant regional conflicts, which engulfs the United States into destructive involvements that bleed unnecessary blood and squander national treasure.</p>
<p>It is this New World Order that is in charge. State Department lackeys; duped into thinking they serve the cause of freedom, implement tactics and objectives that cause profound hatred towards America by much of the world. Those who know the real score and direct the actual formulation of policy, seek to join the ranks of world dominators, who have no allegiance to country, principles or moral values.</p>
<p>Examine the pattern of State Department betrayal. What a great result from the liberation of <a href="http://batr.org/wrack/080805.html">Iraq</a> to rid all those weapons of mass destruction. Expanding the opium trade in <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/030412.html">Afghanistan</a> surely deserves praise. Then there is the killing <a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/030611.html">Gaddafi</a> that resulted in that Benghazi success. Next was the Egyptian coup d&#8217;état of <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/020611.html">Mubarak</a> and the subsequent removal of the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood government. Finally, leading up to the current campaign against <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/090213.html">Syria</a>, that is proving more difficult than usual, demonstrates that keeping the orthodox mission in the protection of <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/013006.html">Israel</a> does not always go smoothly.Yes, that New World Order playbook needs to produce a continuous crop of villains. How else can a permanent and undeviating condition of controlled chaos exist? Managing fashioned circumstances for the benefit of the crown elites is the prescribed procedure of the State Department.</p>
<p>Enter the bona fide &#8220;Big Dog&#8221;, <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/061012.html">Vladimir Putin Nemesis of the New World Order</a>. Establishment reports by the Zionist owned mass media is a massive cover-up. The State Department conceived operation to expand the NWO and engulfing Ukraine into the European Union sphere of control goes unreported. The enforcement military machine of the New World Order is <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/021203.html">NATO</a>. This pathetic attempt to reconstitute the cold war to save a dying economic banksters system is just the latest political propaganda to deceive the public.</p>
<p>The &#8220;so called&#8221; liberation thugs that engaged in street warfare are part of a western inspired scheme that used <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/111303.html">George Soros</a> operative fronts as cover. When the <a href="http://www.hangthebankers.com/us-spent-5-billion-to-destabilize-ukraine/">US spent $5 billion to destabilize Ukraine</a>, such illegal intervention undermines self-determination at its core. The correct conclusion to draw from such efforts follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The protests in the western Ukraine are organized by the CIA, the US State Department, and by Washington-and EU-financed Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) that work in conjunction with the CIA and State Department. The purpose of the protests is to overturn the decision by the independent government of Ukraine not to join the EU.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nuland &#8220;was expressing in shortened form the frustration with the inability of the EU to come up with any kind of sugar to make the medicine go down,&#8221; said Gati. &#8220;What she is saying is we’ve got a crisis here, we’ve got to move, we can’t go by EU business as usual.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The New World Order is build upon factions of elites that pivot around crux interests, while guiding their own governments into accepting the long-term outlook. One such foundational precept requires that the central banksters manage countries that are already in arrears in their debt payments. With the selection of <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/central-banker-pm-says-ukraine-ready-for-imf-auction-block">Arseniy Yatseniuk</a>, the central banker politico as PM for the post-coup Ukraine, the real purpose behind the upheaval becomes clear.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yats is also ready to impose IMF austerity on Ukraine, already one of the poorest nations in Europe. &#8220;Yatsenyuk is the kind of technocrat you want if you want austerity, with the veneer of professionalism,&#8221; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2014/02/27/washingtons-man-yatsenyuk-setting-ukraine-up-for-ruin/">Vladimir Signorelli</a>, president of boutique investment research firm Bretton Woods Research LLC in New Jersey, told Forbes last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;He’s the type of guy who can hobnob with the European elite. A Mario Monti type: unelected and willing to do the IMFs bidding.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The announced <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/03/05/eu-to-provide-ukraine-15-billion-aid-package-in-loans-and-grants/">EU $15B aid package</a> to provide much needed cash to Ukraine accelerates the intrusion of NWO dominance into the heartland of the former Soviet empire. As the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/state-department-preparing-sanctions-against-russia-n43276">State Department Is Preparing Sanctions Against Russia</a>, the NeoCons and International Libs in <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/us-congress-rushing-toward-russia-sanctions-131851765.html">Congress</a> eagerly want to ratchet up the appearance of a new cold war to divert away from domestic woes and a collapsing war on the terror hoax.Yet the internal motivations out of the United States government carry little weight, when viewed within the context of the long-term master plans, for extending the current New World Order into a non-compete global dominion. Pushing Russia into the arms of an already hostile China certainly does not serve the security of America. However, that is exactly the probable outcome from getting involved, (like this designed covert regime change) in the internal affairs of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Lest one forgets, that Communism was the invention of the international banksters, recognize that authoritarianism is the normal condition of human governments. The totalitarian collectivism that the phony western democracies practice produces corporate fascism. This is the preferred version of global rule that the New World Order seeks.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the non-elected pawns of the transitional Ukrainian NWO protectorate states, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/06/world/europe/ukraine-russia-tensions/">Crimea &#8216;was, is and will be an integral part of Ukraine&#8217;</a>, you get the Yats effect of a CNN reported illusion. For the reality, the RT coverage that <a href="http://rt.com/news/crimea-referendum-status-ukraine-154/">Sevastopol and Crimean parliament vote to join Russia, referendum to be held</a>, describes the actual circumstances.</p>
<p>The pathetic hypocrisy when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/ukraine-crisis-russia-crimea-eu-un-live">Obama says Crimea referendum would &#8216;violate international law&#8217;</a>, fails to account for the capricious attitude and deadly methods employed to oust the Viktor Yanukovych government. What legitimate international law standard did the <a href="http://rt.com/news/ashton-maidan-snipers-estonia-946/">snipers</a> use to kill both police and protestors in Kiev?Playing king maker is a very dangerous game that the State Department undertakes at its own risk. Applying these same tactics, what will be the response when the liberation dissenters surround the capital and start a national demonstration to oust the DC criminal class from power? Surely, calling out the tanks to restore the homeland order will be the official response.</p>
<p>With every assault orchestrated to establish a government regime change favorable to the New World Order, the prospects of meaningful resistance diminishes. When the State Department leads the parade to dump defiant state leaders, the actual legitimacy of our own government’s authority evaporates.</p>
<p>Calling on the world community for moral permission to eliminate opposition states is like applying for a loan from the World Bank. Strings are attached that only benefit the shylock.</p>
<p>One needs to distinguish the genuineness of Western Civilization from the immorality of US/EU/NATO interventionism. Permanent war is the lifeblood of the New World Order. The last thing this planet needs is a global empire, which removes any country that rejects and resists the NWO feudalist model. The essence of true liberty demands that ethnic populations organize around and among their own kind.</p>

</div>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an industrial combine in Nazi Germany called <strong>IG Farben</strong>. It was the largest chemical/pharmaceutical octopus in the world. It owned companies, and it had favorable business agreements with companies from England to Central America to Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/nixon-rockefeller-ig-farben-and-global-control/" target="_blank">As I mentioned in a recent article</a>, the author of The <em>Devil’s Chemists</em>, Josiah DuBois, traveled to Guatemala in the early days of World War 2, and returned with the comment that, as far as he could tell, Guatemala was “a wholly owned subsidiary of Farben.”</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical empire was and is one of the major forces behind the European Union (EU). It is no accident that these drug corporations wield such power. They aren’t only involved in controlling the medical cartel; they are political planners.</p>
<p>This is how and why Big Pharma fits so closely with what is loosely referred to as the New World Order. The aim of enrolling every human in a cradle-to-grave system of disease diagnosis and toxic drug treatment has a larger purpose: to debilitate, to weaken populations.</p>
<p>This is a political goal. It facilitates control.</p>
<p>IG Farben’s component companies, at the outbreak of World War 2, were <strong>Bayer</strong>, <strong>BASF</strong>, and <strong>Hoechst</strong>. They were chemical and drug companies. Farben put Hitler over the top in Germany, and the war was designed to lead to a united Europe that would be dominated by the Farben nexus.</p>
<p>The loss of the war didn’t derail that plan. It was shifted into an economic blueprint, which became, eventually, the European Union.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s first president was <strong>Walter Hallstein</strong>, the Nazi lawyer who, during the war, had been in charge of post-war legal planning for the new Europe.</p>
<p>As the Rath Foundation reports: In 1939, on the brink of the war, Hallstein had stated, “The creation of the New Law [of the Nazis] is ONLY the task of the law-makers!”</p>
<p>In 1957, with his reputation sanitized, Hallstein spoke the words in this manner: “The European Commission has full and unlimited power for all decisions related to the architecture of this European community.”</p>
<p>Post-war, IG Farben was broken up into separate companies, but those companies were following a common agenda. If, for example, you want to know why the endless debate over labeling GMO food rivals the real issue—banning GMO crops altogether—you can look to these Farben allies: Bayer, BASF, and <strong>Sanofi</strong>, among others.</p>
<p>They are among the leaders in GMO research and production. BASF cooperates with<strong>Monsanto</strong> on research projects. Sanofi is a leader in GM vaccine research.</p>
<p>The original IG Farben had a dream. Its executives and scientists believed they could eventually produce, synthetically, any compound in a laboratory. They could dominate world industry in this fashion.</p>
<p>The dream never died. Today, they see gene-manipulation as the route to that goal.</p>
<p>I refer you to the explosive book, <em>The Nazi Roots of the Brussels EU</em>, by Paul Anthony Taylor, Aleksandra Niedzwiecki, Dr. Matthias Rath, and August Kowalczyk. You can read it at <em>relay-of-life.com</em>. It is a dagger in the heart of the EU.</p>
<p>At the Rath Foundation, you can also read Joseph Borkin’s classic, “The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben.”</p>
<p>In 1992, I was deeply engaged in researching the specific devastating effects of medical drugs. Eventually, I concluded that, at the highest levels of power, these drugs weren’t destructive by accident. They were intended to cause harm. This was covert chemical warfare against the population of the planet. The <strong>Rockefeller-Standard Oil-Farben</strong>connection was a primary piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>It was, of course, Rockefeller (and <strong>Carnegie</strong>) power that forced the birth of pharmaceutical medicine in America, with the publication of the 1910 Flexner Report. The Report was used to excoriate and marginalize Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and other forms of traditional natural practice, in favor of what would become the modern juggernaut of drug-based treatment.</p>
<p>In an article about the FDA, “Medical Murder in the Matrix,” I point out the fact that this federal agency has permitted at least 100,000 deaths of Americans, per year, from the direct effects of drugs it, the FDA, has certified as safe.</p>
<p>The FDA knows these death figures. “Unintended” and “accidental” can no longer be applied to this ongoing holocaust.</p>
<p>The same can be held true for the pharmaceutical industry itself.</p>
<p>People are exceedingly reluctant to come to this obvious conclusion. They prefer to hem and haw and invent excuses or deny the facts.</p>
<p>To understand the dimensions and history of the ongoing chemical warfare against the population, in the form of medical drugs (and of course pesticides), one must factor in the original octopus, IG Farben.</p>
<p>World War 2 never ended. It simply shifted its strategies.</p>
<p>And just as one can trace extensive collaboration between major American corporations and the Nazi war machine, during the military phase of the war, today you see American corporations wreaking destructive havoc on the American people, as Dow, DuPont, Monsanto and others “work their magic for a better life.”</p>
<p>In any fascist system, the bulk of the people working inside the system, including scientists, refuse to believe the evidence of what is happening before their own eyes. They insist they are doing good. They believe they are on the right side. They see greater top-down control as necessary and correct. They adduce reasonable explanations for inflicted harm and death.</p>
<p>This is how and why conspiracies can exist. Only a few people, at the very top, need to know the true motives.</p>
<p>Everyone else tells themselves fairy tales. This deep-seated obsession is an integral part of mind control, and ultimately it is self-inflicted.</p>
<p>The self-created victim calculates: “I would rather stay in my dream than wake up to a nightmare.”</p>
<p>Yes, but acknowledging the nightmare is a step on the road to liberation.</p>
<p>In centuries past, empires conquered foreign lands and made colonies out of them. When that era ended, a less overt style of military and economic conquest was initiated. But there is something most people don’t realize.</p>
<p>When richer nations now go into poorer nations, the so-called incidental goal of bringing “life-saving” medical care with them is a front and a pose.</p>
<p>One of the chief goals of the conquerors is, in fact, pharmaceutical. Changing the habits of populations, so they come to rely on these drugs is high on the to-do list. It rings up profit, of course, for the pharmaceutical empire, and it also poisons the poor into even greater desolation than they are already experiencing. They become even easier to control.</p>
<p>On top of that, the actual untreated causes of the routine desolation—starvation, generation-to-generation malnutrition, contaminated water supplies, lack of general sanitation, overcrowding, and previously stolen agricultural land—are shoved on the back burner of the global media.</p>
<p>Suddenly, we learn that various germ-caused diseases are the real scourges of these countries, and help is coming (slowly), in the form of drugs that kill the germs, along with the medical heroes who will deliver these drugs.</p>
<p>This is a cover story. It’s a preposterous lie. In the conditions of desolation mentioned above, it doesn’t matter what germs are present, and trying to attack them is futile and absurd.</p>
<p>The general desolation weakens and destroys immune systems. At that point, what would normally be completely harmless germs, any germs, can sweep through an area and cause death and severe illness, because the routine processes of the immune system, which would immediately neutralize the germs, are disabled.</p>
<p>The “medical intervention” is meant to defer, for yet another day, the remedying of the actual problems that keep causing disease—and the medical drugs create new and lethal toxicity, leading to more deaths.</p>
<p>This is the standard op of the modern pharmaceutical empire. To know it is proceeding apace, all you have to do is see foreign doctors getting off planes in Third World countries, or read about some drug giant that is undertaking a humanitarian program of supplying medicines and vaccines to “people in desperate need of them.”</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“From the moment the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States has relentlessly pursued a strategy of encircling Russia, just as it has with other perceived enemies like China and Iran. It has brought 12 countries in central Europe, all of them formerly allied with Moscow, into the NATO alliance. US military power is now directly on Russia’s borders…This crisis is in part the result of a zero-sum calculation that has shaped US policy toward Moscow since the Cold War: Any loss for Russia is an American victory, and anything positive that happens to, for, or in Russia is bad for the United States. This is an approach that intensifies confrontation, rather than soothing it.”</em></p>

<p><em>“We have removed all of our heavy weapons from the European part of Russia and put them behind the Urals” and “reduced our Armed Forces by 300,000. We have taken several other steps required by the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces Treaty in Europe (ACAF). But what have we seen in response? Eastern Europe is receiving new weapons, two new military bases are being set up in Romania and in Bulgaria, and there are two new missile launch areas — a radar in Czech republic and missile systems in Poland. And we are asking ourselves the question: what is going on? Russia is disarming unilaterally. But if we disarm unilaterally then we would like to see our partners be willing to do the same thing in Europe. On the contrary, Europe is being pumped full of new weapons systems. And of course we cannot help but be concerned.”</em></p>

<p>The Obama administration’s rationale for supporting the fascist-led coup in Ukraine collapsed on Wednesday when a “hacked” phone call between EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Estonian foreign minister Urmas Paet revealed that the snipers who fired on protestors in Maidan Square in Kiev were not aligned with President Viktor Yanukovych, but with the protest leaders themselves. The significance of the discovery cannot be overstated since the Obama team has used the killing of protestors to justify its support for the new imposter government. Now it appears that members of the new government may be implicated in the killing of innocent civilians. This new information could force Obama to withdraw his support for the coup plotters in Kiev, which would derail the administration’s plan to remove Russia from the Crimea and expand NATO into Ukraine. Here’s a short recap of the details from an article in Russia Today:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Estonian foreign ministry has confirmed the recording of his conversation with EU foreign policy chief is authentic. Urmas Paet said that snipers who shot at protesters and police in Kiev were hired by Maidan leaders.</p>
<p>During the conversation, Paet stressed that “there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition.”….</p>
<p>The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement on its website, saying that the recording of the leaked telephone conversation between Paet and Ashton is “authentic.” (“<a href="http://rt.com/news/estonia-confirm-leaked-tape-970/" target="_blank">Estonian Foreign Ministry confirms authenticity of leaked call on Kiev snipers</a>“, Russia Today)</p></blockquote>
<p>To its credit, the UK Guardian published an article reporting the basic facts, but there’s been no coverage by the New York Times, the Washington Post or any of the major TV News networks. America’s elite media are engaged in a coordinated news blackout to keep people from seeing that the Obama administration and their EU collaborators are supporting a group of far-right extremists who were directly involved in the killing of civilians in order to topple a democratically-elected government. Here’s more from the same article:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…there is a stronger and stronger understanding that behind snipers it was not Yanukovych, it was somebody from the new coalition,” Paet says…the same handwriting, the same type of bullets, and it’s really disturbing that now the new coalition, that they don’t want to investigate what exactly happened.” (“<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-bugged-call-catherine-ashton-urmas-paet" target="_blank">Ukraine crisis: bugged call reveals conspiracy theory about Kiev snipers</a>“, Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>There won’t be an investigation because an investigation would reveal the truth, and the truth would undermine Obama’s plan to install a puppet regime in Kiev. The new government has already shown that it is more than willing to do Washington’s bidding, that is, to impose austerity measures on the working people of Ukraine, to pay off fatcat bondholders in Berlin and Brussels via more extortionist IMF loans, to extend NATO to Russia’s border in contravention of agreements made with Bush the Elder following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and to pursue the crackpot dreams of global hegemony laid out in “The Grand Chessboard” by New World Order fantasist Zbigniew Brzezinski. These are the primary objectives of the present policy which could be upended by the allegations of foul play.</p>
<p>The smoking gun revelations of the hacked phone call came just hours before US officials indicated they were planning to increase their military footprint in Eastern Europe. According to the World Socialist Web Site:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Pentagon will boost joint training of NATO forces in Poland and step up NATO air patrols in the Baltics…US military officials said they were deploying six F-15 fighter jets and KC-135 transport planes. ….One guided-missile frigate, the USS Taylor, is still in a Black Sea port in Turkey after patrolling the region during the Sochi Olympics…</p>
<p>Turkish officials confirmed that they had given a US Navy warship permission to pass through the Bosphorus straits into the Black Sea, which borders Ukraine.” (“Amid Ukraine crisis, US launches military escalation in Eastern Europe”, World Socialist Web Site)</p></blockquote>
<p>Also Russia Today reports that: “The guided missile destroyer, the USS Truxton, is heading to the Black Sea, for what the US military said is a “routine” deployment…The ship has a crew of about 300 and is part of an aircraft carrier strike group that left the US in mid-February.” (“US navy confirms missile destroyer USS Truxton approaching the Black Sea”, RT)</p>
<p>“Routine deployment”? So provoking a war with Russia is “routine”? Talk about understatement.</p>
<p>The military escalation occurs in an atmosphere of heightened tension between the two nuclear-armed powers and will certainly add to their mutual distrust. Hagel’s deployment is consistent with a plan for antagonizing Moscow that was proposed just days earlier in the Washington Post by the Obama administration’s ideological godfather, Zbigniew Brzezinski. Here’s a bit of what Brzezinski had to say in the article titled “What is to be done? Putin’s aggression in Ukraine needs a response”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…the West should promptly recognize the current government of Ukraine as legitimate. Uncertainty regarding its legal status could tempt Putin to repeat his Crimean charade…</p>
<p>“…the West should convey.. that the Ukrainian army can count on immediate and direct Western aid so as to enhance its defensive capabilities. There should be no doubt left in Putin’s mind that an attack on Ukraine would precipitate a prolonged and costly engagement, and Ukrainians should not fear that they would be left in the lurch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NATO forces, consistent with the organization’s contingency planning, should be put on alert. High readiness for some immediate airlift to Europe of U.S. airborne units would be politically and militarily meaningful. If the West wants to avoid a conflict, there should be no ambiguity in the Kremlin as to what might be precipitated by further adventurist use of force in the middle of Europe.” (“What is to be done? Putin’s aggression in Ukraine needs a response”, Washington Post)</p></blockquote>
<p>“Adventurist”? Dr. Strangelove is calling the Kremlin adventurist when his recommendations would put NATO, the US and Moscow on hairtrigger alert increasing the chances of an error in judgment that could lead to thermonuclear war. Isn’t that the pot calling the kettle black?</p>
<p>But listen to the tone of Brzezinski’s op-ed. In just a few short paragraphs, the author–who many respect as a restrained and brilliant global strategist–refers to Putin as a thug, a Mafia gangster, Mussolini, and Hitler. I imagine if he had another paragraph to work with, he would have added Beelzebub Satan to the list.</p>
<p>This isn’t politics; it’s hysterics. It’s incendiary, jingoistic mumbo-jumbo intended to rouse the public and fan the flames of nationalism. It’s the same kind of self-righteous raving that precipitated the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>And what is Brzezinski saying?</p>
<p>Is he saying that events in the Crimea are a threat to US national security? Is he saying that the US should now feel free to apply the Monroe Doctrine everywhere across the planet, sticking our big nose wherever the president sees fit?</p>
<p>The trouble in the Crimea has nothing to do with the United States. We have no dog in this fight. This is about military expansion into Eurasia, this is about pipeline corridors and oil fields, this is about dismantling the Russian Federation and positioning multinational corporations and Wall Street investment banks in Asia for the new century. And, finally, this is an ego-driven crusade by an old man who wants to see his looneybin NWO global hegemony vision enacted before they cart him off on a marble slab. That’s what this is really about; the glorious new world disorder, the dystopian wetdream of thinktank patricians everywhere whose only purpose in life is to initiate wars that other-peoples-sons will have to fight.</p>
<p>Entering Ukraine into the corporate-western alliance is a critical part of Brzezinski’s masterplan. The basic strategy has been underway since the fall of the Berlin Wall when neoliberal carpetbaggers from the US assisted in the looting of the former Soviet state leaving Russia politically broken and economically destitute. Since then, US policy towards Russia has been overtly hostile, making every effort to encircle the oil-rich nation while positioning nuclear missile installations on its perimeter. Now Washington is using its fascist-backed coup in Ukraine to force Moscow to relinquish its grip on a region that is vital to its national security.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief excerpt from an interview with Stephen Cohen, professor of Russian studies and history emeritus at New York University on Monday on PBS Newshour. Cohen helps to clarify what is really going on viv a vis the US and Russia:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What we’re watching today is the worst kind of history being made, the descent of a new Cold War divide between West and East in Europe, this time not in faraway Berlin, but right on Russia’s borders through Ukraine. That will be instability and the prospect of war for decades to come for our kids and our grandchildren. The official version is that Putin is to blame; he did this. But it simply isn’t true. This began 20 years ago when Clinton began the movement of NATO toward Russia, a movement that’s continued.</p>
<p>…the fundamental issue here is that, three or four years ago, Putin made absolutely clear he had two red lines…One was in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. (Putin would not allow NATO in Georgia) The other was in Ukraine. We crossed both. You got a war in Georgia in 2008, and you have got today in Ukraine because we, the United States and Europe, crossed Putin’s red line.” (PBS News Hour)</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s no doubt who is to blame for the present conflict in Cohen’s mind. It’s Washington.</p>
<p>So, here we are, between a rock and a hard place: Putin cannot back down on an issue that’s crucial to national security, and Washington is more determined than ever to pull Ukraine into –what Henry Kissinger calls–”a cooperative international system.” (aka–global capitalist rule) That means there’s going to be a war.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Crimea MPs voted unanimously to hold a referendum on whether the region should become a part of Russia or not. The balloting will take place in 10 days although Obama has already said that he will not honor the results. Apparently, other countries need to get the green-light from Washington before they conduct their elections now. This is how ridiculous things have gotten.</p>
<p>In 2008, Brzezinski revealed the real motives behind US aggression in Central Asia in an article that appeared in the Huffington Post that dealt primarily with the dust up in Georgia. (where Putin deployed Russian troops to defend Russian speaking civilians in South Ossetia.) Here’s what Brzezinski had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The question the international community now confronts is how to respond to a Russia that engages in the blatant use of force with larger imperial designs in mind: to reintegrate the former Soviet space under the Kremlin’s control and to cut Western access to the Caspian Sea and Central Asia by gaining control over the Baku/Ceyhan pipeline that runs through Georgia.</p>
<p>In brief, the stakes are very significant. At stake is access to oil as that resource grows ever more scarce and expensive and how a major power conducts itself in our newly interdependent world, conduct that should be based on accommodation and consensus, not on brute force.</p>
<p>If Georgia is subverted, not only will the West be cut off from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia. We can logically anticipate that Putin, if not resisted, will use the same tactics toward the Ukraine. Putin has already made public threats against Ukraine.” (“Brzezinski: Russia’s invasion of Georgia is Reminiscent of Stalin’s attack on Finland”; Huffington Post)</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? It sounds a lot like Brzezinski thinks that oil should be his. Or maybe he thinks it belongs to the western oil giants; is that it?</p>
<p>So we’re not dealing with national security, sovereignty or spheres of influence here. What we’re really talking about is “access to oil.” Not only that, but Brzezinski is being quite blunt in his assertion that “the West” –as he calls it–has a legitimate claim to the resources on other people’s land. Where’d he come up with that one?</p>
<p>In another interview on Kavkacenter.com, in 2008, Brzezinski sounded the same alarm with a slightly different twist. Here’s an excerpt from the article titled ”Russia tends to destabilize Georgia”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Brzezinski said the United States witnessed “cases of possible threats by Russia… motivated not by some territorial disputes….but caused by intention to take control over the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline”.</p>
<p>“If Georgia government is destabilized, western access to Baku, Caspian Sea and further will be limited”, said Brzezinski …. he stated that Russia will try to consolidate its monopoly on these markets and will use all existing political and economic levers, including “politically motivated cessation of energy supplies” in Europe and Baltic states.</p>
<p>“Russia actively tends to isolate the Central Asian region from direct access to world economy, especially to energy supplies”, considers the political scientist.” (“Zbigniew Brzezinski: ”Russia tends to destabilize Georgia” <a href="http://www.kavkacenter.com/" target="_blank">kavkacenter.com</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Putin is not isolating anyone and he’s certainly not taking over anyone’s damned pipeline. He’s the president of Russia. He sells oil and makes money, that’s how the system works. It’s called capitalism. But the oil is theirs. The natural gas is theirs. The pipelines are theirs. Not ours. Get over it!</p>
<p>Don’t kid yourself, it’s all about oil. Oil and power. The United States imperial ambitions are thoroughly marinated in oil, access to oil, and control of oil. Without oil, there’s no empire, no dollar hegemony, no overbloated, bullyboy military throwing weaker countries against the wall and extorting tribute. Oil is the coin of the realm, the path to global domination.</p>
<p>Putin has audacity to think that the oil beneath Russian soil belongs to Russia. Washington wants to change his mind about that. And that’s why the situation in Ukraine is so dangerous, because the voracious thirst for oil is pushing us all towards another world war.</p>

<p>Their <i>al Qaeda</i> terrorists soundly defeated by Hezbollah forces in Syria, the City of London Illuminati banksters have turned their sights on resource-rich Ukraine. They knew Russian President Vladimir Putin would be distracted by the Sochi Olympics, along with the barrage of threats and propaganda being hurled his way by these demonic Zio-fascists and their Western media lapdogs.</p>
<p>With unlimited time and money at their disposal, this is the bankster <i>modus operandi</i>. They attack where they see opportunity, retreat when defeated, then attack another sector of the planet within days based on vulnerability and resources.</p>
<p>Ukraine declared independence from the old Soviet Union in 1990. In 2004-2005 Western NGOs worked with CIA/Mossad/MI6 assets to stage the phony Orange Revolution. Victor Yuschenko became Prime Minister but was poisoned during the campaign. Western media blamed it on the Russians, but it was likely a Mossad operation since he was succeeded by more bankster-friendly right-wing billionaire Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko had co-led the Orange Revolution and is one of Ukraine’s richest people. In 2005 <i>Forbes</i> named her the third most powerful woman in the world. In 2007 she traveled to the US to meet with Vice-President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor Condaleeza Rice to talk energy. Tymoshenko became rich as an executive at a natural gas company.</p>
<p>Ukraine was being plugged into Cheney’s crooked Energy Policy Task Force, which opened the planet to unregulated oil &amp; gas exploration, including fracking. Tymoshenko privatized over 300 state industries during her reign,</p>
<p>But the Ukrainian people smelled a rat.</p>
<p>In 2010 they voted in Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych with 48% of the vote. His Party of Regions again defeated Tymoshenko’s Fatherland Party in parliamentary elections of 2012.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko was convicted of embezzlement of state funds and abuse of power. She was given a seven year prison sentence and fined $188 million. The crimes occurred in the natural gas sector.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Tymoshenko was released from prison as part of a deal hatched at a secret meeting between Yanukovych, EU, NATO and Russian officials first reported by William Engdahl in an article for <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/02/27/the-rape-of-ukraine-phase-two-begins/">Veterans Today</a>. Soon after her release all hell broke loose.</p>
<p><b>Mossad’s Fascist Friends</b></p>
<p>On February 22nd snipers opened fire from rooftops on Kiev’s square. Engdahl says these snipers were members of a far-right fascist terror cell known as Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People’s Self Defense (UNA-UNSO).</p>
<p>Led by Andriy Shkil, the group has ties to the neo-Nazi German National Democratic Party. According the Engdahl’s intelligence sources UNA-UNSO is part of a secret NATO Gladio cell and was involved in conflicts ranging from Georgia to Kosovo to Chechnya as part of a strategy of tension aimed at Russia.</p>
<p>Shkil also has direct ties to Tymoshenko, as does newly installed Prime Minster Oleksandr Turchynov, a Baptist preacher and former Tymoshenko advisor who took over after Yanukovych fled under threat to his life to Russia.</p>
<p>In 2006 state prosecutors opened a criminal case against Turchynov, who was accused of destroying files which showed Tymoshenko’s ties to organized crime boss Semion Mogilevich. With Turchynov as Prime Minister Ukraine is now under the thumb of fascist organized criminals known collectively as Right Sector.</p>
<p>It came as no surprise then, when <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/03/01/352724/israeli-army-vet-led-kiev-militia-unit/">Press TV</a> reported that both <i>Haaretz</i> and the <i>Times of Israel</i> openly bragged of how a group of “former” Israeli soldiers known as the Blue Helmets of the Maidan had led the “protesters” in Kiev’s square under the leadership of a man code-named Delta. According to <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/02/17/us-eu-paying-ukrainian-rioters-protesters-paul-craig-roberts/">Paul Craig Roberts</a>, these “protestors” were also being paid by the EU and US.</p>
<p>A Mossad coup brought Right Sector to power, pushing aside more moderate voices being funded and backed by the US, as revealed in the now-infamous YouTube video showing Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland discussing with US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt (both Israeli assets within the State Department) who they would want to install as Ukrainian Prime Minster once they got rid of Yanukovych.</p>
<p><b>A Resource Grab</b></p>
<p>As usual this Rothschild-led bankster <i>putsch</i> is all about resources. Ukraine lies in a highly strategic geographic location, fronting both the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Ukraine is the bread basket of the Eastern Hemisphere. In 2011 it was the world’s 3rd largest grain exporter. It ranks in the top 10 countries in the world for sought-after farmland.</p>
<p>Ukraine has the 2nd largest military in Europe after Russia and the NATO Rothschild tool would love nothing better than to run out the<a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/analysts-black-sea-port-in-ukraine-still-key-to-russia-s-naval-interests-1.270904">Russian Black Sea Fleet</a> at Sevastopol – a symbol of Russian naval power since the 18th century.</p>
<p>Ukraine has vast natural gas deposits, an advanced industrial base and is a highly strategic crossroads for oil &amp; gas pipelines connecting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Their-Bankers-Persian-Gulf/dp/1453757732">Four Horsemen</a> Caspian Sea energy fields with European consumers. In 2009 a dispute between Putin and Tymoshenko over Russia’s trans-Ukrainian gas supplies caused a huge spike in gas prices in Europe.</p>
<p>In October 2013 the IMF met with Ukrainian officials to discuss the country’s alleged “budget crisis”. The bankster enforcer arm demanded that Ukraine double consumer prices for natural gas and electricity, devalue its currency, slash state funding for schools and the elderly, and lift a ban on the sale of its rich farmland to foreigners. In return for this Ukraine was promised a measly $4 billion.</p>
<p>Yanukovych told the IMF to take a hike and Russia soon stepped in promising <i>cheaper</i> energy and stating it would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian bonds. Yanukovych was now on the bankster hit list, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Russia has responded to the Ukrainian coup by sending troops into the Crimea to protect its mostly Russian-speaking population and the Black Sea Fleet. It was here 160 years ago where Catherine the Great launched a major campaign to seize the Crimea from Ottoman sultans.</p>
<p>During WWII ethnic Tatars in Crimea collaborated with Hitler in seizing the region briefly, before Stalin routed them and expelled the Tatar separatists. Many have since returned.</p>
<p>As this drama unfolds, look for the banksters’ Western media tool to make up some “humanitarian crisis” involving the Tatars. There will be more trouble in Crimea.</p>
<p>But the Russians have responded swiftly, as has the alternative media. It ain’t like the good old days, where bankster coups went unquestioned and unnoticed. The Ukrainian people will not stand for these fascists for long either. They saw the empty promises brought forth by the last bankster “event”- the Orange Revolution.
