<p>A mass exodus from ignorance and organized opposition to tyranny is the dream of every freedom loving person within the Liberty Movement today.  We would like nothing better than to put an end to the expanding establishment police state in the most peaceful manner possible.  We dream of a day when a transition back to the Constitutional values that once made America brilliantly unique in the world is possible, and can be accomplished without incredible pain or terrible bloodshed.  We long for that once-in-a-century uprising, that great march, that spontaneous eruption of the citizenry demanding a more truthful government.  At the same time, though, we realize that such events are rare, and few if any great changes in the history of man are made without sacrifice, and without direct confrontation.</p>
<p>The reason why peaceful and popular activism almost never occurs successfully, the reason why good people are made to stand and suffer, falls not only to the establishment elites who seek out and abuse power; there are others who share in the blame.  Regardless of the age, the culture, or the social conditions, there is ALWAYS a percentage of the general populace that embraces the totalitarian dynamic.  There is always someone in our neighborhood, in our workplace, and within our family that finds vindication or advantage in supporting the state, even if the state has turned viciously criminal.  They are not only useful idiots; they are conscious participants in the process of pacification and enslavement of their own society.  They understand their role perfectly, and they enjoy what they do.</p>
<p>The psychologist Carl Jung in his examination of the rise of violent fascism in Germany as well as the collectivist surveillance state in communist Russia theorized that there is in fact a certain percentage of people in any given epoch that carry within them a latent ability to abandon conscience.  That is to say, there is always hidden within a portion of the multitude an inborn potential for sociopathic and psychopathic tendencies.  These tendencies remain dormant for many under most circumstances, but every once in a while a society falters to the point where such diseases of the soul are encouraged, and the monsters in millions are allowed to come out and play.</p>
<p>Is it possible that some men are more apt towards truth and freedom while others take more naturally to dominance and deceit?  Perhaps.  I find that under certain circumstances even the best human beings can make catastrophic errors in judgment.  However, there is a difference between those who misstep in life, and those who savor destruction.  For these people I reserve the label of the “statist thug”; a ghoul in common man’s drag just waiting for the opportunity to scrape out a spoonful of petty authority and assert his will over others.  These folks are the day’s damned.  And what’s worse; though they may have been born with a predisposition towards despotism, they still had a choice, and they chose villainy.  They deserve no special treatment and no quarter from us.</p>
<p>As America faces down wave after wave of fiscal difficulties, a government gone rogue with false left/right politics, and policies that disregard civil liberties for the sake of centralized authority, I believe the statist thugs of our time will soon flow out of the dark recesses and rotten sputtering gutters of our society like a river of septic putrescence.  We all know them when we see them, but do we really understand what makes them tick?  Here are some common psychological attributes of the overzealous statist; the failings and inadequacies that make him what he is…</p>
<p><strong>Statist Thugs Thrive During Immoral Times</strong></p>
<p>The worst statists are utter screw-ups and failures in normal or semi-normal environments.  They barely have the ability to function without constant surrounding chaos and desperation which they use to camouflage their spastic and childish characters.  They are often seen as the dregs of a culture during peaceful years, and only climb to prominence when crisis overtakes the nation.  When a social environment turns tenuous or explosive, the statist excels.  Corrupt governments require the aid of questionable individuals in order to tighten control at the local level, and so anyone willing to set aside morality and principle automatically becomes a highly valued commodity.  Statists will flock to government employment during national “emergencies” or unjust wars, and use the inbred system to their advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Statist Thugs Want Respect, Even If They Don’t Deserve It</strong></p>
<p>Statists demand respect, and they will pursue authoritative positions just so they can remind people of the respect they are supposedly owed.  Some of them do realize that legitimate respect is earned through valuable works, knowledge, experience, and generous creativity.  They know it cannot be bought, and that it cannot be conned through clever talk, boastful discussion, and theatrical chest beating.  And so, instead of attempting real achievement, or taking the risk of falsely playing a part and being exposed, they look for a title and a uniform to fill the void.  They eventually attain respect derived by force through institutions within the system.  This title will likely be a miniscule part of the overall government conglomerate, but the statist will act as if he is the emperor of Earth once you wander into his narrow jurisdiction.  The slightest hint of defiance will send him into fits of rage.</p>
<p><strong>Statist Thugs Only Understand Violence</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that not every person in a uniform is a statist, and identifying them is more a matter of behavior than outward appearance.  There is no such thing as reason, logic, or even law in the realm of the statist thug.  You cannot discuss a matter of conflict with him.  You cannot point out that the legal structure he claims to represent does not support his views.  You cannot calm him using words and solid philosophy.  The only thing he understands is power, and the only thing that he regards is strength.  When faced with overwhelming reason, the statist will attack rather than think.  This attack, unfortunately, will only be silenced by an equal or greater display of force…</p>
<p><strong>Statist Thugs Savor Weakness In Others</strong></p>
<p>Show any signs of fear or weakness and you have given the statist exactly what he has always wanted.  He does not desire an equal fight.  In truth, he avoids situations in which his opponents are fairly matched.  This is because, deep down, all statists and power monger are cowards.  Anyone who is so desperate to control every aspect of his environment even to the point of hurting and enslaving others is obviously afraid of a great many things.  Attempting to be quietly diplomatic or grasping for mercy only encourages them to take their maliciousness to the next level.  Statists seek easy prey to satiate their thirst for dominance.  They will abuse women, children, the elderly and disabled, anyone that cannot defend themselves.  As soon as the goon encounters a person willing and able to fight back, however, his smug façade disappears and the hidden coward emerges.<br />
<strong><br />
Statist Thugs Love Law For The Law’s Sake</strong></p>
<p>Statists revel in bureaucracy and red tape.  They love laws and regulations regardless of application.  They feel safe within a highly structured and contained system because most of them are followers, not leaders.  The idea that they may one day have to blaze their own path without the aid of a vast government machine cradling them like lost infants is terrifying to them.  Statists are not able to survive without someone telling them what to do and when to do it.  On the other side of the coin, they also enjoy the manner in which the modern legal framework can be twisted to fit whatever disturbed logic happens to strike them.  The more a society is cluttered with overt legalities, the easier it is to misinterpret and exploit the distraction and confusion they create.<br />
<strong><br />
Statists Believe Government Should Parent Society</strong></p>
<p>The goal of a statist is to impress his will upon others by any means necessary.  Government simply offers the most expedient and convenient tool for them to do the job.  Of course, in their minds many of them will try to rationalize the abuse of government power by asserting that it is ultimately for the good of everyone.  It is not enough for them to live life the way they see fit for themselves; all people must be “shown the light” for the betterment of the group as a whole.  When confronted with someone who dissents against their oppressive world view, they usually respond by accusing the activist of “not caring about other people’s well being, or the well being of the country”.   You will almost always hear the Statist talk about the group, or the collective, over the individual, because the easiest way to dominate the citizenry is to erase the concept of unique individualism and condition them towards herd behavior.  Individuals with strong characters infuriate statists.<br />
<strong><br />
Anyone Can Be A Statist</strong></p>
<p>Many people (myself included) have never found much solace in the establishment and its parade of self-importance.  For me, most methodologies of government have always been a sick kind of joke.  Elaborate buildings and ceremonies, nice suits and uniforms, the money and the celebrity, the news shows and talking heads; it’s all costume.  It’s a parade of drunken clowns and carneys dipped in glamour and glitter and pomp.</p>
<p>The very concept of government is in itself an abstraction.  It is an artificial social edifice that seems to give weaker men a sense of security (or false security), even when it is at bottom a threat to them.  The assumption is that the establishment (meaning the power elite) must exist at all costs.  The statist cannot imagine otherwise.  He is at once a fan of the totalitarian game and an avid bouncing giggling cheerleader.  His greatest dream is to be a part of the beast; to share in the “glory” of the empire and live vicariously through its conquests.</p>
<p>A statist thug can be anyone, from the overweight and overzealous TSA agent at the airport to the brutally nosy and vicious old lady next door.  Some participate in tyranny directly by wearing the uniform and wielding the baton, while others participate behind closed doors and curtains by informing on their neighbors.  Regardless of their demeanor, each statist has one thing in common; an obsession with the continuance of the system to the point of madness.  There is absolutely nothing the state can do to make them second guess their love affair.  No crime too shocking,no attack too unjust.  During the blackest moments of mankind, they are the willing tools of oppression.  They make revolution &#8211; physical revolution, necessary.  With them, oligarchs take root.  Without them, oligarchs take shelter, or disappear altogether.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/PetraeusAffair2.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/PetraeusAffair2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a><em>The headline stories claim that CIA Director General David Petraeus resigned as head of the CIA because of an adulterous relation with his young biographer and that General John Allen, Supreme Commander of US troops in Afghanistan, was under investigation and his promotion to top commander of US troops in Europe was on hold, because, we are told, of his ‘inappropriate’ comments in the exchange of e-mails with a civilian female friend.  We are told that a ‘hard-charging’ local FBI agent, Frederick Humphries, Jr., had uncovered amorous e-mails sent by General Petraeus to his girlfriend-biographer in the course of investigating a complaint of ‘cyber-stalking’.  Out of concern that the General’s ‘adulterous behavior’ posed a risk to US national security, Florida-based FBI Agent Humphries handed the evidence over to one of Washington, DC’s most powerful Republican, Congressman Eric Cantor, who in turn passed them on to the Director of the FBI… leading to Petraeus resignation.</em></p>
<p>In other words, we are asked to believe that a single, low-ranking, zealous FBI agent has toppled the careers of two top US Generals: one in charge of the principle global intelligence agency, the CIA, and the other in command of the US and allied combat forces in the principle theater of military engagement – on the basis of infidelity and flirtatious banter!</p>
<p>Nothing could be more far-fetched simply on prima facie evidence.</p>
<p>In the sphere of tight hierarchical organizations, like the military or the CIA, where the activity and behavior of subordinate functionaries is centrally directed and any investigation is subject to authorization by senior officials (most especially regarding prying into the private correspondences of the heads of the CIA and of strategic military operations), the idea that a lone agent might operate free-lance is preposterous.  A ‘cowboy’ agent could not simply initiate investigation into such ‘sensitive’ targets as the head of the CIA and a General in an active combat zone without the highest level authorization or a network of political operatives with a much bigger agenda.   This has much deeper political implications than uncovering a banal sexual affair between two consenting security-cleared adults despite the agent’s claim that fornication constitutes a threat to the United States .</p>
<p>Clearly we are in deep waters here:  This involves political intrigue at the highest level and has profound national security implications, involving the directorship of the CIA and clandestine operations, intelligence reports, multi-billion dollar expenditures and US efforts to stabilize client regimes and destabilize target regimes.  CIA intelligence reports identifying allies and enemies are critical to shaping global US foreign policy.  Any shift at the top of the US empire’s operational command can and does have strategic importance.</p>
<p>The ‘outing’ of General Allen, the military commander in charge of Afghanistan, the US main zone of military operations occurs at a crucial time, with the scheduled forced withdrawal of US combat troops and when the Afghan ‘sepoys’, the soldiers and officers of the puppet Karzai regime, are showing major signs of disaffection, is clearly a political move of the highest order.</p>
<p>What are the political issues behind the beheading of these two generals?  Who benefits and who loses?</p>
<p>At the global level, both Generals have been unflinching supporters of the US Empire, most especially the military-driven components of empire building.  Both continue to carry out and support the serial wars launched by Presidents Bush and Obama against Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as, the numerous proxy wars against Libya , Syria , Yemen , Somalia , etc.  But both Generals were known to have publicly taken positions unpopular with certain key factions of the US power elite.</p>
<p>CIA Director, General Petraeus has been a major supporter of the proxy wars in Libya and Syria .  In those efforts he has promoted a policy of collaboration with rightwing Islamist regimes and Islamist opposition movements, including training and arming Islamist fundamentalists in order to topple targeted, mostly secular, regimes in the Middle East .  In pursuit of this policy – Petraeus has had the backing of nearly the entire US political spectrum.  However, Petraeus was well aware that this ‘grand alliance’ between the US and the rightwing Islamist regimes and movements to secure imperial hegemony, would require re-calibrating US relations with Israel .  Petraeus viewed Netanyahu’s proposed war with Iran, his bloody land grabs in the Occupied Territories of Palestine and the bombing, dispossession and assassination of scores of Palestinians each month, were a liability as Washington sought support from the Islamist regimes in Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Gulf States, Iraq and Yemen.</p>
<p>Petraeus implied this in public statements and behind closed doors he advocated the withdrawal of US support for Israel ’s violent settler expansion into Palestine , even urging the Obama regime to pressure Netanyahu to reach some settlement with the pliable US client Abbas leadership.  Above all, Petraeus backed the violent jihadists in Libya and Syria while opposing an Israel-initiated war against Iran, which he implied, would polarize the entire Moslem world against the Washington-Tel Aviv alliance and ‘provoke the US-proxy supplied Islamist fundamentalists to turn their arms against their CIA patrons.  The imperial policy, according to General Petraeus world view, was in conflict with Israel ’s strategy of fomenting hostility among Islamist regimes and movements against the US and, especially, the Jewish state’s promotion of regional conflicts in order to mask and intensify its ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians.  Central to Israeli strategy and what posed the most immediate threat to the implementation of a Petraeus’ doctrine was the influence of the Zionist power configuration (ZPC) in and out of the US government.</p>
<p>As soon as General Petraeus’ report naming Israel as a ‘strategic liability’ became known, the ZPC sprang into action and forced Petraeus to retract his statements – at least publicly.  But once, he became head of the CIA, Petraeus continued the policy of working with rightwing Islamist regimes and arming and providing intelligence to jihadi fundamentalists in order to topple independent secular regimes, first in Libya, then on to Syria.  This policy was placed under the spotlight in Benghazi with the killing of the US ambassador to Libya and several CIA/Special Forces operatives by CIA-backed terrorists leading to a domestic political crisis, as key Republican Congress people sought to exploit the Obama administration’s diplomatic failure.  They especially targeted the US Ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, whose maladroit efforts to obscure the real source of the attacks in Benghazi , have undermined her nomination to replace Hilary Clinton as Secretary of State.</p>
<p>General Petraeus, faced with mounting pressure from all sides: from the ZPC over his criticism of Israel and overtures to Islamist regimes, from the Republicans over the Benghazi debacle and from the FBI, over the personal investigation into his girlfriend and hyped up media smear, gave in.  He ‘fessed up’ to a ‘sexual affair’, saluted and resigned.  In so doing, he ‘sacrificed’ himself in order to ‘save the CIA’ and his strategy of long-term alliance-building with ‘moderate’ Islamist regimes while forming short-term tactical alliances with the jihadists to overthrow secular Arab regimes.</p>
<p>The key political operative behind the high-level FBI operation against Petraeus has been House Majority leader Eric Cantor, who cynically claims that the General’s romantic epistles represent a national security threat.  We are told that Congressman Cantor gravely passed the e-mails and reports he had received from the ‘Lone Ranger’ FBI agent Humphries to FBI Director Mueller ordering Mueller to act on the investigation or else face his own Congressional inquiry.</p>
<p>Washington-based Representative Cantor is a zealous lifetime Israel-firster and has been hostile to the Petraeus report and the General’s assessment of the Middle East .  Florida-based, Agent Humphries was not just any old conscientious gum-shoe:  He was a notorious Islamaphobe engaged in finding terrorists under every bed.  His claim to fame (or infamy) was that he had arrested two Muslims, one of whom, he claimed, was preparing to bomb the Los Angeles airport while the other allegedly planned a separate bombing.  In a judicial twist, unusual in this era of FBI sting operations, both men were acquitted of the plots for lack of evidence, although one was convicted for publishing an account of how to detonate a bomb with a child’s toy!  Agent Humphries was transferred from Washington State to Tampa , Florida – home of the US military’s Central Command (CENTCOM).</p>
<p>Despite their clear differences in station and location, there are ideological affinities between House Majority Whip Cantor and Agent Humphries – and possibly a common dislike of General Petraeus.  Concerns over his Islamophobic and ideological zealotry may explain why the FBI quickly yanked Agent Humphries out from his mission of ‘obsessive’ prying into CIA Director Petraeus and General Allan’s e-mails.  Undeterred by orders from his superiors in the FBI, Agent Humphries went directly to fellow zealot Congressman Cantor.</p>
<p>Who would have benefited from Petraeus ouster?  One of the top three candidates to replace him as head of the CIA is Jane Harmon, former California Congresswomen and Zionist uber-zealot.  In another twist of justice, in 2005 the Congresswoman had been captured on tape by the National Security Agency telling Israeli Embassy personnel that she would use her influence to aid two AIPAC officials who had confessed to handing classified US documents to the Israeli Mossad, if the AIPAC could round up enough Congressional votes to make her Chairwoman of the US House Committee on Intelligence, an act bordering on treason, for which she was never held to account.  If she were to take his position, the ousting of CIA Director Petraeus could represent to the greatest ‘constitutional coup’ in US history: the appointment of a foreign agent to control the world’s biggest, deadliest and richest spy agency.  Who would benefit from the fall of Petraeus? – first and foremost – the State of Israel.</p>
<p>The innuendos, smears and leaked investigation into the private e-mails of General Allen revolve around his raising questions over the US policy of prolonged military presence in Afghanistan .  From his own practical experience General Allen has recognized that the puppet Afghan army is unreliable: hundreds of US and other NATO troops have been killed or wounded by their Afghan counterparts, from lowest foot soldiers to the highest Afghan security officials, ‘native’ troops and officers that the US had supposedly trained for a much ballyhooed ‘transfer of command’ in 2014.  General Allen’s change of heart over the Afghan occupation was in response to the growing influence of the Taliban and other Islamist resistance supporters who had infiltrated the Afghan armed forces and now had near total control of the countryside and urban districts right up to the US and NATO bases.  Allen did not believe that a ‘residual force’ of US military trainers could survive, once the bulk of US troops pulled out.  In a word, he favored, after over a decade of a losing war, a policy of cutting the US ’ losses, declaring ‘victory’ and leaving to regroup on more favorable terrain.</p>
<p>Civilian militarists and neo-conservatives in the Executive and Congress refuse to acknowledge their shameful defeat with a full US retreat and a likely surrender to a Taliban regime.  On the other hand, they cannot openly reject the painfully realistic assessment of General Allen, and they certainly cannot dismiss the experience of the supreme commander of US ground forces in Afghanistan .</p>
<p>When, in this charged political context, the rabidly Islamaphobic FBI agent Humphries ‘stumbled upon’ the affectionate personal correspondences between General Allen and ‘socialite’ femme fatale Jill Kelly, the Neocons and civilian militarists whipped up a smear campaign through the yellow journalists at the Washington Post, New York Times and Wall Street Journal implying another ‘sex’ scandal – this time involving General Allen. The neo-con– militarist-mass media clamor forced the spineless President Obama and the military high command to announce an investigation of General Allen and postpone Congressional hearings on his appointment to head the US forces in Europe .  While the General quietly retains his supreme command of US forces in Afghanistan , he has become a defeated and disgraced officer and his expertise and professional views regarding the future of US operations in Afghanistan will no longer be taken seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Key Unanswered Questions Surrounding Elite Intrigues and Military Purges</strong></p>
<p>Given that the public version of a lone-wolf, low ranking, zealously Islamophobic and incompetent FBI agent who just happened to ‘discover’ a sex scandal leading to the discrediting or resignation of two of the US highest military and intelligence officials is absurd to any thinking American, several key political questions with profound implications for the US political system need to be addressed.  These include:</p>
<p>1.       What political officials, if any, authorized the FBI, a domestic security agency to investigate and force the resignation of the Director of the CIA?</p>
<p>2.       Have the current police state structures, with their procedures for widespread and arbitrary spying led to our spy agencies spying on each other in order to purge each other’s top personnel?  Is this like the sow devouring her own offspring?</p>
<p>3.      What were the real priorities of the political power-brokers who protected the insubordinate FBI agent Humphries after he defied top FBI officials’ orders to stop meddling in the investigation of the CIA Director?</p>
<p>4.      What were FBI Agent Humphries ties, if any, to the neo-con, Zionist or Islamophobic politicians and other intelligence operatives, including the Israeli Mossad?</p>
<p>5.      Despite Obama’s effusive praise of his brilliant ‘warrior-scholar’ General Petraeus in the past, why did he immediately ‘accept’ (aka ‘force’) the CIA Director’s resignation after the revelation of something as banal in civilian life as adultery?  What are the deeper political issues that led to the pre-emptive purge?</p>
<p>6.      Why are critical political issues and policy disputes resolved under the guise of blackmail, smears and character assassination, rather than through open debates and discussions, especially on matters pertaining to the nation’s choice of strategic and tactical ‘allies’ and the conduct of overseas wars?</p>
<p>7.      Has the purge and public humiliation of top US military officers become an acceptable form of “punishment by example”, a signal from civilian militarists that when it comes to dealing with politics toward the Middle East, the role of the military is not to question but to follow their (and Israel’s) directives?</p>
<p>8.      How could a proven collaborator with the Israeli-Mossad and Zionist zealot like Jane Harmon emerge as a ‘leading candidate’ to replace General Petraeus, as Director of the CIA, within days of his resignation?  What are the political links, past and present between Congressman Eric Cantor, (the fanatical leader of the pro-Israel power bloc in the US Congress, who handed Agent Humphries’ unauthorized files on Petraeus over to the FBI Director Muellar) and Zionist power broker Jane Harmon, a prominent candidate to replace Petraeus?</p>
<p>9.       How will the ouster of Director Petraeus and Jane Harman’s possible appointment to head the CIA deepen Israeli influence and control of US Middle East policy and the US overtures to Islamist countries?</p>
<p>10.  How will the humiliation of General Allen affect the US ‘withdrawal’ from the disaster in Afghanistan ?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The purge of top-level generals and officials from powerful US foreign policy and military posts reflects a further decay of our constitutional rights and residual democratic procedures: it is powerful proof of the inability of leadership at the highest level to resolve internecine conflicts without drawing out the ‘long knives’.  The advance of the police state, where spy agencies have vastly expanded their political power over the citizens, has now evolved into the policing and purging of each other’s leadership:  the FBI, CIA , Homeland Security, the NSA and the military all reach out and build alliances with the mass media, civilian executive and congressional officials as well as powerful foreign interest ‘lobbies’ to gain power and leverage in pursuit of their own visions of empire building.</p>
<p>The purge of General Petraeus and humiliation of General Allen is a victory for the civilian militarists who are unconditional supporters of Israel and therefore oppose any opening to ‘moderate’ Islamist regimes. They want a long-term and expanded US military presence in Afghanistan and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The real precipitating factor for this ugly ‘fight at the top’ is the crumbling of the US empire and how to deal with its new challenges.  Signs of decay are everywhere:  Military immorality is rampant; the be-medaled generals sodomize their subordinates and amass wealth via pillage of the public treasury and military contracts; politicians are bought and sold by millionaire financial donors, including agents of foreign powers, and foreign interests determine critical US foreign policy.</p>
<p>The disrepute of the US Congress is almost universal – over 87% of US citizen condemn ‘the House and Senate’ as harmful to public welfare, servants of their own self-enrichment and slaves of corruption.  The economic elites are repeatedly involved in massive swindles of retail investors, mortgage holders and each other.  Multi-national corporations and the fabulously wealthy engage in capital flight, fattening their overseas accounts.  The Executive himself (the ever-smiling President Obama) sends clandestine death squads and mercenary-terrorists to assassinate adversaries in an effort to compensate for his incapacity to defend the empire with diplomacy or traditional military ground forces or to prop-up new client-states.  Cronyism is rife: there is a revolving door between Wall Street and US Treasury and Pentagon officials.  Public apathy and cynicism is rife; nearly 50% of the electorate doesn’t even vote in Presidential elections and, among those who do vote, over 80% don’t expect their elected officials to honor  their promises.</p>
<p>Aggressive civilian militarists have gained control of key posts and are increasingly free of any constitutional constraints.  Meanwhile the costs of military failures and burgeoning spy, security and military budgets soar while the fiscal and trade deficit grows.  Faction fights among rival imperial cliques intensify; purges, blackmail, sex scandals and immorality in high places have become the norm.  Democratic discourses are hollowed out:  democratic state ideology has lost credibility.  No sensible American believes in it anymore.</p>
<p>Is there a broom large enough to clean this filthy Augean stable?  Will a ‘collective Hercules’ emerge from all this intrigue and corruption with the strength of character and commitment to lead the revolutionary charge?  Surely the sell-out and crude humiliation of American military officials on behalf of the ‘chicken-hawk’ civilian militarists and their foreign interests should make many an officer re-think his own career, loyalty and commitment to the Constitution.</p>

<p>The rule of law is an empty memory of the past. The powers that rule are globalists that control governments and use their media outlets to write the first version of history. They pull the strings of the intelligence agencies that function as over throwers of non-compliant regimes. Constitutional restrictions that limit impulsive or capricious dictates once protected citizens. With the utter eradication of separations of power and the &#8220;<em>Federalist</em>&#8220;, form of distinct roles and authority of independent States, the core legitimacy of the United States vanished.</p>
<p>As central ascendancy consolidates, the tyranny of the majority becomes obvious to even the most vocal statist proponent. The reason for this development is well defined. The most wicked and corrupt criminals have hijacked the system and dismantled the checks and balances, placed into the constitutional framework.</p>
<p>However, let us be crystal -clear. The original formation of a supreme central government doomed the infant republic to the same fate of all other countries. Most Americans are so deep in denial that they are unable to confront the truth of this conclusion. The legislative, legal and judicial systems are all complicit in the destruction of the independence of individual states. States’ Rights are essential, and are the original jurisdiction authority, that formed a purported limited role for the federal government.</p>
<p>The hedonistic hordes that extend their consent to the dictatorial governance keep voting for more oppression. A nation of free people endowed in Liberty has become a cesspool of cretins begging for more social welfare benefits and cradle to grave guarantees.</p>
<p>The reliance of executive orders to circumvent, &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People's_House"><em>The People’s House</em></a>&#8220;, has relegated Congress to a homeless child in a globalist orphanage. The internationalists, who unremittingly sought the dismantling of the principles and goals of the American Revolution, have commandeered the compromised institutions of power. Their handpicked candidates and administrators are mere tools for the banksters and corporatists in their long quest to subjugate the public under fiat edicts that only benefit the oligarchy elites. With the passage of the <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/patriot/">Patriot Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf">NDAA</a>, you have two dreadful examples of the extent of the authoritarianism that rules this country.</p>
<p>Where is the national outrage? What happened to the spirit of the populace that once fought tyranny, but now accepts the boot of a despot on the genitals of a neutered stud? Macho-man, now relegated to video games, act as wimps and yes-men to threats from the federal government stooges.</p>
<p>The military-industrial-security complex wages uninterrupted warfare without any declaration of war or real national threat. The homeland is euphuism for the police state. The domestic drone deployment sheds the Bill of Rights that presupposes the criminalization of ordinary citizens. Who really cares, when the public continues to accept the dictates of the ruling class?</p>
<p>Preppers, labeled as internal terrorists, are slated for FEMA re-education camps. While bleeding heart collectivists point to the recent east coast storm as justification for more big government. Soon the call for more federal powers will be posted all over the sick social networks by the halfwits that solicit an upgrade to the newest Obamaphone.</p>
<p>The causes for the disintegration of commonly shared traditional culture are part of a master plan to destroy our country. Unless people overcome their fear of ostracization by establishment apologists and discover a backbone, the obligatory pattern of propaganda indoctrination, will remain.</p>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/christieobama.jpg" />As the country is coerced into greater compliance, resistance to illegitimate orders is the crucial element needed to foster a needed confrontation with federal thugs. The visual images and verbal sucking up by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to the dictator in chief, Barack Hussein Obama is symptomatic of the national malaise that worships at the throne of the &#8220;Dear Leader&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those confused that Christie disrespected the GOP campaign, fail to appreciate that loyalty to the political system requires homage to the dictatorship, before your next gratuitous photo op. A toady in find standing is a necessary requirement to get your own party’s nomination in the next presidential cycle.</p>
<p>Even at a time of national distress and regional emergency, Washington bureaucrats should not decide the tasks of rebuilding. Yet, the strings attached for federal aid, always requires a pound of flesh to be paid. Could compliance with Agenda 21 be in the fine print for FEMA claims?</p>
<p>Such edicts poison the good will from constructive relief. However, the largesse out of the deficit coffers of the federal treasury necessitates states succumb to political blackmail. This is not a new trend, only the acceleration, frequency and audaciousness as the intimidation increases. Conditions for assistance are dandy opportunities to keep the heel on the throat of the petitioning states.</p>
<p>The constitution is used as wrapping paper, when it comes to the prescription plan used by agencies like FEMA. Carving up the remnants of the prophetic wisdom from separations of power is now the new national anthem.</p>
<p>Allowing federal power grabs has left a legacy of tyranny that touches every level of government. Yet, the apathetic public refuses to fight this absolutism. The globalists have succeeded in their scheme to brainwash the servile populace into accepting that there is no way to alter the supremacy of the beast. Since most voters reflect that conclusion in their balloting practices, the technocrats keep skimming off local home rule with every regulation or decree.</p>
<p>Community ordinances best serve the populist interest. For this very reason, globalists are relentless in their hatred of individual independence. Arbitrary decisions are a way of life for the enablers of the potentates. The elites that write legislative policy also dominate the selection and composition of the administrative bureaus that control much of the political process.</p>
<p>However, accepting that the political process is relegated to feeble attempts to elect new representatives misses the practical reality. The imbalance in the Federalistmodel of government is a root cause that allows elites to destroy society.</p>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/Edicts.jpg" /><br />
What is lacking in the hearts and spirit of our fellow neighbors is the courage to accept Patrick Henry’s proclamation: &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/view_/110701.html">Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death!</a>&#8221; This country was born by revolution, but is dying under the fright that the federal government may target you as a dissenter. A national revolt is imperative, fought not with weapons, but with the bravery of trusting in the salvation of your immortal soul.Your own self-respect demands action. Indifference is no longer an option. Without political involvement and vocal pressure, the forces of dictatorial edicts will intensify. The constitutional <a href="http://theoldspeakjournal.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/1st-amendment-rights-to-petition-assemble-to-be-suspended-u-s-congress-passes-trespass-bill-making-protest-illegal/">right to assemble and petition</a> your government is now criminalized.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The US House of Representatives voted 388-to-3 in favor of ‘The Federal Restricted Buildings And Grounds Improvement Act of 2011&#8242;. The bill will allow the government to bring charges against Americans exercising their rights as protesters, demonstrators and activists at political events and other outings across America. So not only can you be subjected to the indignity of being labeled a low-level terrorist for daring to petition your government for grievances, but protest itself, and other ‘disruptive activity’ in the presence or vicinity of government officials, buildings, &amp; ‘official functions’ is being deemed illegal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Political officials fear the public because the enforcement arm of the evil empire is disposable. The goons that obey orders are beginning an awareness of their expendability. How long will they protect the mad emperor or another tyrannical successor, when the outpour of the masses, finally realizes that the police state is designed to prey on your own person?</p>
<p>Careerist political sycophants and big government lackeys enable the globalists. They are the adversary of the public. The deception of a beneficial federal government is manifestly absurd. Discretionary crony favoritism is a result of this corrupt political culture. The beltway disease infects even the sturdiest of public servants.</p>
<p>The depravity virus is more acute in the federal syndrome because the central government perfects deficit spending as a high art form. Wasting money is rewarded in its extreme. Issuing favors or buying votes qualifies for a vested pension. Pursuing foes with harsh regulations, stipulates your allegiance for advancement.</p>
<p>The bludgeon club used to impose federal dictates grows longer and weighs heavier with each year. Wishful thinking that elections will place honest representatives into seats of power is often pointless. However, for those so inclined to register disapproval in the upcoming presidential election, you might want to consider some alternative candidates.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://american3rdposition.com/">AMERICAN THIRD POSITION PARTY</a> (A3P) - <a href="http://merlinmiller2012.com/?page_id=7">Merlin Miller</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.constitution-party.net/party_platform.php">CONSTITUTION PARTY</a> - <a href="http://www.goodeforpresident2012.com/biography.html">Virgil Goode</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lp.org/">LIBERTARIAN PARTY</a> - <a href="http://www.garyjohnson2012.com/front">Gary Johnson</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Read their stand on the issues. The power elites will not quietly relinquish their stranglehold of their perverted and repressive government. The fundamental failure of citizens rests with their reluctance to confront evil. The federal government is despotism on steroids. Until the public accepts this assessment and commits themselves to replace the tyrannical monster with a limited constitutional republic, the fate of the nation will continue to deteriorate. A fiat presidency is pure treason. Woefully, how many folks are willing to manifest the moral fiber of Patrick Henry?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/death-panels3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/death-panels2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>The Southeast Asian country of Laos in the late 1950s and early 60s was a complex and confusing patchwork of civil conflicts, changes of government and switching loyalties. The CIA and the State Department alone could take credit for engineering coups at least once in each of the years 1958, 1959 and 1960. No study of Laos of this period appears to have had notable success in untangling the muddle of who exactly replaced whom, and when, and how, and why. After returning from Laos in 1961, American writer Norman Cousins stated that &#8220;if you want to get a sense of the universe unraveling, come to Laos. Complexity such as this has to be respected.&#8221; <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Syria 2012 has produced its own tangled complexity. In the past 18 months it appears that at one time or another virtually every nation in the Middle East and North Africa as well as members of NATO and the European Union has been reported as aiding those seeking to overthrow the regime of Bashar al-Assad, while Russia, China, and several other countries are reported as aiding Assad. The Syrian leader, for his part, has consistently referred to those in combat against him as &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, citing the repeated use of car bombs and suicide bombers. The West has treated this accusation with scorn, or has simply ignored it. But the evidence that Assad has had good reason for his stance has been accumulating for some time now, particularly of late. Here is a small sample from recent months:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;It is the sort of image that has become a staple of the Syrian revolution, a video of masked men calling themselves the Free Syrian Army and brandishing AK-47s — with one unsettling difference. In the background hang two flags of Al Qaeda, white Arabic writing on a black field &#8230; The video, posted on YouTube, is one more bit of evidence that Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremists are doing their best to hijack the Syrian revolution.&#8221; (<em>New York Times</em>, July 24, 2012)</li>
<li>A leading German newspaper reported that the German intelligence service, BND, had concluded that 95% of the Syrian rebels come from abroad and are likely to be members of al Qaeda. (<em>Die Welt</em>, September 30, 2012)</li>
<li>&#8220;A network of French Islamists behind a grenade attack on a kosher market outside Paris last month also planned to join jihadists fighting in Syria &#8230; Two suspects were responsible for recruiting and dispatching people &#8216;to carry out jihad in some countries – notably Syria&#8217;,&#8221; a state prosecutor said. (<em>Associated Press</em>, October 11, 2012)</li>
<li>&#8220;Fighters from a shadowy militant group [Jabhat al-Nusra] with suspected links to al-Qaida joined Syrian rebels in seizing a government missile defense base in northern Syria on Friday, according to activists and amateur video. &#8230;The videos show dozens of fighters inside the base near a radar tower, along with rows of large missiles, some on the backs of trucks.&#8221; (<em>Associated Press</em>, October 12, 2012)</li>
<li>&#8220;In a videotape posted this week on militant forums, the Egyptian-born jihadist Ayman al-Zawahiri &#8230; urged support for Syria&#8217;s uprisings.&#8221; (<em>Associated Press</em>, October 28, 2012)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to your favorite news source or commentator, President Assad is either a brutal murderer of his own people, amongst whom he has had very little support; or he&#8217;s a hero who&#8217;s long had the backing of the majority of the Syrian population and who is standing up to Western imperialists and their terrorist comrades-in-arms, whom the US is providing military aid, intelligence, and propaganda services.</p>
<p>Washington and its freedom fighters <em>de jour</em> would like to establish Libya II. And we all know how well Libya I has turned out.</p>
<h2>Of backward nations and modern nations</h2>
<p>Page one of the October 24 <em>Washington Post</em> contained a prominent photo of a man chained to a concrete wall at a shrine in Afghanistan. The accompanying story told us that the man was mentally ill and that &#8220;legend has it that those with mental disorders will be healed after spending 40 days in one of the shrine&#8217;s 16 tiny concrete cells&#8221;, living &#8220;on a subsistence diet of bread, water and black pepper.&#8221; Every year hundreds of Afghans bring mentally ill relatives to the shrine for this &#8220;cure&#8221;.</p>
<p>Immediately to the right of this story, constituting the paper&#8217;s lead story of the day, we learn that the United States is planning to continue its policy of assassinating individuals, via drone attacks, for the foreseeable future. This is Washington&#8217;s &#8220;cure&#8221; for the mental illness of not believing that America is the savior of mankind, bringing democracy, freedom and happiness to all. (The article adds that the number of &#8220;militants and civilians&#8221; killed in the drone campaign over the past 10 years will soon exceed 3,000 by some estimates, surpassing the number of people killed on September 11.)</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there are many people in Afghanistan, high and low, who know that their ancient cure is nonsense, but the chainings have continued for centuries. Just as certain, there are American officials who know the same about their own cure. Here&#8217;s a senior American official: &#8220;We can&#8217;t possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us. &#8230; We&#8217;re not going to wind up in 10 years in a world of everybody holding hands and saying, &#8216;We love America&#8217;.&#8221; Yet , we are told, &#8220;Among senior Obama administration officials, there is a broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade. Given the way al-Qaeda continues to metastasize, some officials said no clear end is in sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>We can also be confident that there have been people chained to the wall in Afghanistan who were not particularly mentally ill to begin with but became so because of the cure. And just as certain, there have been numerous people in several countries who were not anti-American until a drone devastated their village, family or neighbors.</p>
<p>The <em>Post</em> article also reported that Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned from Pakistan a while ago and recounted a heated confrontation with his counterpart, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. &#8220;Mullen told White House and counterterrorism officials that the Pakistani military chief had demanded an answer to a seemingly reasonable question: After hundreds of drone strikes, how could the United States possibly still be working its way through a &#8216;top 20&#8242; list?&#8221;</p>
<p>American officials defended the arrangement even while acknowledging an erosion in the caliber of operatives placed in the drones&#8217; cross hairs. &#8220;Is the person currently Number 4 as good as the Number 4 seven years ago? Probably not,&#8221; said a former senior U.S. counterterrorism official. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s not dangerous.&#8221; The <em>Post</em> added this comment: &#8220;Internal doubts about the effectiveness of the drone campaign are almost nonexistent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day we could read in the <em>Post</em>: &#8220;There is ample evidence in Pakistan that the more than 300 [drone] strikes launched under Obama have helped turn the vast majority of the population vehemently against the United States.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Wake up and smell the bullshit. Then go vote.</h2>
<p>After the second presidential debate in early October, Luke Rudkowski of the media group <em>We Are Change</em> asked Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, about President Obama&#8217;s widely reported &#8220;kill list&#8221; of Americans and foreigners who can be assassinated without charge or trial.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Luke Rudkowski:</strong> &#8220;If President Romney becomes president, he&#8217;s going to inherit President Barack Obama&#8217;s secret &#8216;kill list&#8217;? This is going to be debated. How do you think Romney will handle this &#8216;kill list,&#8217; and are you comfortable with him having a &#8216;kill list&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Wasserman Schultz:</strong> &#8220;I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Luke Rudkowski:</strong> &#8220;Obama has a secret &#8216;kill list&#8217; which he has used to assassinate different people all over the world.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Wasserman Schultz:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m happy to answer any serious questions you have.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Luke Rudkowski:</strong> &#8220;Why is that not serious?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Wasserman Schultz</strong>: &#8220;Because I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Luke Rudkowski:</strong> &#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The existence of the U.S. &#8216;kill list&#8217; has been publicly known for nearly two years and was the subject of a 6,000-word exposé in the <em>New York Times</em> in May.</p>
<p>At the same event, Sierra Adamson of <em>We Are Change</em> asked former White House Press Secretary and current Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs about the U.S. killing of Abdulrahman Awlaki, the teenage son of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Sierra Adamson:</strong> &#8220;Do you think that the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki&#8217;s 16-year-old son, who was an American citizen, is justifiable?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robert Gibbs:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get into Anwar al-Awlaki&#8217;s son. I know that Anwar al-Awlaki renounced his citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sierra Adamson:</strong> &#8220;His son was still an American citizen.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robert Gibbs:</strong> &#8220;Did great harm to people in this country and was a regional al-Qaeda commander hoping to inflict harm and destruction on people that share his religion and others in this country. And&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sierra Adamson:</strong> &#8220;That&#8217;s an American citizen that&#8217;s being targeted without due process of law, without trial. And he&#8217;s underage. He&#8217;s a minor.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robert Gibbs:</strong> &#8220;I would suggest that you should have a far more responsible father. If they&#8217;re truly concerned about the well-being of their children, I don&#8217;t think becoming an al-Qaeda jihadist terrorist is the best way to go about doing your business.&#8221; <sup>2</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>To demonstrate that the bullshit is bipartisan, we now present Mr. Mitt Romney, speaking during the presidential foreign policy debate: &#8220;Syria is Iran&#8217;s only ally in the Arab world. It&#8217;s their route to the sea. It&#8217;s the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, a look at a map reveals firstly that Iran does not share a border with Syria; there&#8217;s something called Iraq in between; and secondly that Iran already has access to the sea on both its north and south; actually about 1100 miles of coastline. Romney has made this particular blunder repeatedly, and the <em>Washington Post</em> has pointed it out on several occasions. Post columnist Al Kamen recently wrote: &#8220;We tried so hard back in February to get Romney to stop saying that.&#8221; <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Of course, neither Obama nor the debate moderator pointed out Romney&#8217;s errors.</p>
<h2>The sanctity of life</h2>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as pro-life as a person gets,&#8221; Congressman Paul Ryan, the Republican candidate for vice-president, told the conservative <em>Weekly Standard</em> in 2010. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>How nice. Yet the man supports all of America&#8217;s wars, each of which takes the lives of large numbers of people, both American and foreign; and he&#8217;s opposed to national health insurance, which would save countless more lives. The good congressman is also an avid hunter and supporter of gun-owners&#8217; rights, so he apparently is not too pro-life concerning other creatures of God&#8217;s Kingdom. Of course, what Ryan actually means by &#8220;life&#8221; is an embryo or fetus, perhaps even a zygote. Oh wait, that&#8217;s not all of it – corporations are also people whose lives Ryan cherishes.</p>
<h2>The fate of those who do not love the empire</h2>
<p>On October 7 Hugo Chávez won his fourth term in office as president of Venezuela. The feeling of frustration that must have descended upon the Venezuelan and American power elite is likely reminiscent of Chile, March 1973, when the party of another socialist and American <em>bête noire</em>, Salvador Allende — despite the best intentions and dollars without end of the CIA — won about 44 percent of the vote in congressional elections, compared to some 36 percent in 1970. It was said to be the largest increase an incumbent party had ever received in Chile after being in power more than two years. The opposition parties had publicly expressed their optimism about capturing two-thirds of the congressional seats and thus being able to impeach Allende. Now they faced three more years under him, with the prospect of being unable, despite their most underhanded efforts, to prevent his popularity from increasing even further.</p>
<p>During the spring and summer the Agency&#8217;s destabilization process escalated. There was a whole series of demonstrations and strikes, with a particularly long one by the truckers. <em>Time</em> magazine reported: &#8220;While most of the country survived on short rations, the truckers seemed unusually well equipped for a lengthy holdout.&#8221; A reporter asked a group of truckers who were camping and dining on &#8220;a lavish communal meal of steak, vegetables, wine and empanadas&#8221; where the money for it came from. &#8220;From the CIA,&#8221; they answered laughingly. <sup>5</sup></p>
<p>There was as well daily sabotage and violence, including assassination. In June, an abortive attack upon the Presidential Palace was carried out by the military and the ultra-right <em>Patria y Libertad</em>.</p>
<p>In September the military prevailed. &#8220;It is clear,&#8221; said the later US Senate investigating committee, &#8220;the CIA received intelligence reports on the coup planning of the group which carried out the successful September 11 coup throughout the months of July, August, and September 1973.&#8221; <sup>6</sup> The United States had also prepared the way for the military action through its economic intervention and support of the anti-Allende media.</p>
<p>Chávez has already been overthrown once in a coup that the United States choreographed, in 2002, but a combination of some loyal military officers and Chávez&#8217;s followers in the streets combined for a remarkable reversal of the coup after but two days. The Venezuelan opposition will not again make the mistake of not finishing Chávez off when they have him in their custody.</p>
<p>Both Hugo Chávez and Salvador Allende had sinned by creating &#8220;nationalistic&#8221; regimes that served the wrong &#8220;national interest&#8221;. The hatred felt by the power elite for such men is intense. The day after the legally and democratically elected Venezuelan leader was ousted, but before being restored to power, the <em>New York Times</em>(April 13, 2002) was moved to pen the following editorial:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With yesterday&#8217;s resignation [what the coup leaders called it] of President Hugo Chávez, Venezuelan democracy is no longer threatened by a would-be dictator. Mr. Chávez, a ruinous demagogue, stepped down after the military intervened and handed power to a respected business leader.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that the &#8220;respected business leader&#8221;, Pedro Carmona, quickly dissolved the National Assembly and the Supreme Court, and annulled the Venezuelan constitution.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that in the United States the <em>New York Times</em> is widely regarded as a &#8220;liberal&#8221; newspaper; most conservatives would say &#8220;very liberal&#8221;, if not &#8220;socialist&#8221;.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/American-Style-Fascism3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/American-Style-Fascism2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>On October 16, Hofstra University (Hempstead, NY) hosted the second Obama/Romney charade. Demagogic blather again took center stage. Ritualistic theater was featured. Grade F spectacle defines it.</p>
<p>Bombast substituted for substance. Vital facts about the state of the nation and world were excluded. Viewers wasted two hours watching. What they most need to know wasn&#8217;t covered. Instead they were bombarded by duplicity and indifference toward growing human needs.</p>
<p>Duopoly fascism in America excludes alternative voices. Third party candidates are virtually shut out. Getting ballot access alone presents enormous challenges. Major media coverage is denied or too little to matter.</p>
<p>How many American know about other parties, let alone who represents them? Major ones include the Libertarian Party, Constitution Party, Justice Party, and Green Party.</p>
<p>Libertarian Party candidates Gary Johnson/Jim Gray were denied Michigan and Oklahoma ballot access. Constitution Party candidates Virgil Goode/Jim Clymer got on only 26 of 50 state ballots. Justice Party candidates Rocky Anderson/Luis Rodriguez managed only 19.</p>
<p>Green Party candidates Jill Stein/Cheri Honkala were denied access on 12 state ballots. There&#8217;s more. Alternate party candidates are excluded from presidential &#8220;debates.&#8221; Just showing up to watch is hazardous.</p>
<p>Ralph Nader learned the hard way. In 2000, he was accosted and threatened with arrest for trying. Having a valid auxiliary viewing room ticket didn&#8217;t matter. Nader sued and won partial vindication.</p>
<p>Doing so didn&#8217;t erase the stain of America&#8217;s farcical democracy. It exists in name only. USA-style fascism comes wrapped in an American flag. It&#8217;s harsh like other versions but isn&#8217;t discussed.</p>
<p>Only targeted victims feel its sting. Step out of line and become one of them. On October 16, Green Party candidates learned firsthand.</p>
<p>Stein/Honkala&#8217;s web site explained. It headlined &#8220;Jill Stein and Cheri Honkala arrested, call tonight&#8217;s debate a mockumentary,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>Iron-fisted fascism showed up in Hempstead. Stein and Honkala were &#8220;forcibly prevented from entering the grounds of tonight&#8217;s presidential debate&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Corporate/party boss-run Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) members exclude alternative voices. Money power operates secretly with no public oversight. A sham process repeats each electoral cycle.</p>
<p>Real democracy is mocked. Discussion of major issues is excluded. Hardball crackdowns target challengers.</p>
<p>Stein and Honkala &#8220;were arrested by local police when they tried to enter the grounds of Hofstra University&#8230;&#8221; They remained in police custody for hours.</p>
<p>At 2PM Tuesday, they &#8220;walked with supporters&#8221; toward Hofstra&#8217;s &#8220;town hall&#8221; venue.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they were met by three ranks of police officers in uniform and plainclothes. At this point, the Green Party candidates held an impromptu press conference in which Dr. Stein called the CPD debate a &#8216;mockumentary,&#8217; saying that, &#8216;We are here to bring the courage of those excluded from our politics to this mock debate, this mockery of democracy.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>Both candidates &#8220;turned and began walking&#8221; towards the debate venue. Police &#8220;physically stopped them and pushed them back.&#8221; They sat down and were arrested.</p>
<p>They were charged with &#8220;obstructing traffic.&#8221; None was visible at the time. CPD bosses call the shots. Cops don&#8217;t represent ordinary people or independent political candidates.</p>
<p>They serve money power. Hardball crackdowns prove it. Even independent presidential candidates taste their harshness.</p>
<p>On October 17, Stein/Honkala&#8217;s web site headlined &#8220;Now free, Stein, Honkala pledge ramp up fight for open debates,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>After spending eight hours &#8220;handcuffed to a metal chair in a remote (Long Island) police warehouse,&#8221; they&#8217;re free. Exercising democratic rights got them accosted and arrested. That&#8217;s how fascism works. Opposition isn&#8217;t tolerated.</p>
<p>On release, Stein said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was painful but symbolic to be handcuffed for all those hours, because that what the Commission on Presidential Debates has essentially done to American democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In custody, both candidates were isolated. Phone calls were denied. So was access to lawyers or staff. At 10:30PM, they were released. Honkala called her incarceration &#8220;extremely uncomfortable, but standard for what so many Americans face on a daily basis in our corrections system.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and Stein know what gulag harshness feels like. It&#8217;s much worse for many thousands doing hard time. Many are innocent victims of fascist brutality. Innocence is no defense when targeted.</p>
<p>Challenging authority risks prison. Some end up dead. Many face torture and abuse. It&#8217;s the American way. Media scoundrels conceal the nation&#8217;s dark side.</p>
<p>Stein&#8217;s campaign manager Ben Manski expressed outrage, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;These arrests and this treatment are outrageous and disproportionate. Who do the police think they are protecting here?&#8221;</p>
<p>On October 18, 22, 23, and 30, Stein will participate in four alternative candidate debates. Online streaming will cover them. Expect serious discussions of real issues. Expect what duopoly power excludes.</p>
<p>Watch and see what democracy looks like. On November 6, it&#8217;s excluded from ballot consideration. It&#8217;s never been there and isn&#8217;t now. The state of the nation is dark and getting darker. Equity, justice, and freedom are just figures of speech. The worst is yet to come. That&#8217;s how fascism works.</p>
<p>In her 1951 book, &#8220;The Origins of Totalitarianism,&#8221; Hannah Arendt explained. It&#8217;s &#8220;never content to rule by external means, namely, through the state and a machinery of violence; thanks to its peculiar ideology and the role assigned to it in this apparatus of coercion, totalitarianism has discovered a means of dominating and terrorizing human beings from within.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s based on:</p>
<p>&#8220;(1) an elaborate ideology;</p>
<p>(2) a single mass party;</p>
<p>(3) terror;</p>
<p>(4) a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication;</p>
<p>(5) a monopoly of weapons; (and)</p>
<p>(6) a centrally controlled economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>America qualifies. Duopoly power rules. What Big Money wants it gets. State terrorism is policy. So are permanent imperial wars, targeted assassinations, and police state harshness.</p>
<p>Managed news misinformation substitutes for the real thing. Elections are farcical. Money power runs everything. Democratic freedom is more illusion than reality.</p>
<p>In 2003, Laurence Britt explained 14 common fascist elements. America reflects them. They include:</p>
<p>(1) &#8220;Powerful and Continuing Nationalism.&#8221; Expressions include flag displays, lapel pins, mottos, slogans, songs, symbols, and other ways to rally people for a common cause.</p>
<p>(2) &#8220;Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights&#8221; and civil liberties. Affording them hinders elitist ruling power.</p>
<p>(3) &#8220;Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause.&#8221; Alleged threats and enemies are invented. Patriotic frenzy is rallied against them. Popular support is needed. Political advantage is sought.</p>
<p>(4) &#8220;Supremacy of the Military.&#8221; National wealth and resources are disproportionately allocated for it. Domestic needs are neglected.</p>
<p>(5) &#8220;Rampant Sexism.&#8221; Male dominance is enforced. Women are considered second-class citizens.</p>
<p>(6) &#8220;Controlled Mass Media.&#8221; Censorship is policy. Public or private media promote power elite policies. In war time, control is especially rigid.</p>
<p>(7) &#8220;Obsession with National Security.&#8221; Fear is used as an instrument of control.</p>
<p>(8) &#8220;Religion and Government are Intertwined.&#8221; A dominant religion manipulates public opinion even when its ideological tenets differ from state policies.</p>
<p>(9) &#8220;Corporate Power is Protected.&#8221; A mutually beneficial relationship benefits political and business officials.</p>
<p>(10) &#8220;Labor Power is Suppressed.&#8221; Unionism is co-opted or eliminated. Political and corporate dominance is unchallenged.</p>
<p>(11) &#8220;Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts.&#8221; Intellectual and academic freedom is denied. So is free expression in any form.</p>
<p>(12) &#8220;Obsession with Crime and Punishment.&#8221; Police state terror rules. Gulag harshness awaits non-believers. Equity, justice, and other democratic freedoms are denied.</p>
<p>(13) &#8220;Rampant Cronyism and Corruption.&#8221; Privileged government and corporate officials benefit at the expense of most others.</p>
<p>(14) &#8220;Fraudulent Elections.&#8221; Free, fair and open ones don&#8217;t exist. Predetermined results are arranged. Centralized control disenfranchises voters. Theater substitutes for democracy.</p>
<p>America reflects all of the above. Few benefit at the expense of most others. Electoral choices are none at all. Challenge authority and taste police state harshness.</p>
<p>Imagine what&#8217;s coming if ordinary people on their own don&#8217;t change things. It won&#8217;t happen any other way. It never has, never will!</p>

			<p>Advancing Totalitarianism&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/greeceriots-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/greeceriots-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a><a href="http://usawatchdog.com/gerald-celente-the-first-great-war-of-the-21st-century-has-begun/" target="_blank">Gerald Celente claims World War III has begun</a>, Vaclac Klaus says <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2012-09-22/former-ecb-chief-economist-says-ecb-panic-czech-president-warns-end-demoracy-imminen" target="_blank">Europe has given up</a> on Democracy; <a href="http://thedailybell.com/4370/Death-of-Democracy-Propagated-on-Purpose" target="_blank">other sources</a> have acknowledged its demise.</p>
<p>Riots are breaking out around the world.   A new kind of war has begun.</p>
<p>Chaos has been the intent of the power structure for many years.  The United States government has prepared a legal structure to control an uprising.   Police forces have been militarized and federalized, National Guard units are under government control, Canada has agreed to join in putting down rebellion, various agencies of the government have purchased billions of rounds of ammunition, check point structures have been obtained, burial containers have been stockpiled, and detention camps have been constructed.</p>
<p>Leaders, including our government, are urging citizens to <a href="http://www.sovereignman.com/expat/why-is-the-us-government-planning-for-mass-fatalities-8956/" target="_blank">prepare for disasters</a>. Celente recommends gold, guns, and a getaway plan.  Gold is widely accepted as a hedge against inflation and chaos.  Many are recommending that we become self-sufficient by learning to grow our own foods and care for our own health. There is fear that our food supply is being polluted with genetic modifications and contaminated imports. Water is gaining value and the price of fertile farm land is skyrocketing.</p>
<p>The war is between the ninety-nine percent who work and produce the world’s products and the one percent who accumulate the wealth and power.  The faceless one percent is in the process of exerting world-wide control over the ninety-nine percent.  Massive amounts of wealth are being transferred and grinding controls are being put in place.</p>
<p>There have been riots in Spain and Greece; governments overthrown by U. S. armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are unstable and under siege.  In Libya, our ambassador was kidnapped and slain.  Chaos abounds in Syria, Egypt, Pakistan, Yemen, Bahrain, Morocco, and even potentially in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>As the wealth transfer (debt crisis) continues and major nations begin to feel the pain additional unrest is inevitable.  It will finally spread to the United States, England, France, and Germany.  It has been foreseen and preparations have been made.   WWIII involves an effort to gain control of the world.</p>
<p>The United States of America is a strategic part of this new world war.  Our media is pumping out lies and propaganda because it is part of the one percent; it is owned by conspirators and populated with talented individuals who have sold their souls to the same devil that is loose in our government.  Like a nation of Zombies our elected officials support the lies, live the lies, and betray their trust to the liars.  It is a charade of great magnitude so big that a few decades ago everyone would have thought such mendacity would be impossible.</p>
<p>The rewards are great for participating in the biggest lie in the history of the world.  Last year the Obama family spent $1.4 billion of taxpayer money.  <a href="http://www.whitehousedossier.com/2012/06/17/obama-plays-golf-100th-time-presidency/" target="_blank">President Obama</a> has spent three months of his presidency playing golf.  Each outing involves a retinue of friends, several earth vehicles and often the presidential airplane as well.  Foreign trips are even more expensive; a two day trip to India may have cost taxpayers $200 million a day.</p>
<p>Ambitious, money conscious, Westerners, sans immutable restraint, easily succumb to the wiles of a wealthy life and because their souls are secular they sell them cheaply to the evil god of this world. Such people are incapable of governing themselves.</p>
<p>Those predicting the end of Democracy seem concerned.  But students of good government should rise up and cheer!  Our <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Founding_fathers_views_on_democracy" target="_blank">Founders hated Democracy</a> and rightfully contended that it would lead to tyranny.  Change agents have been so successful in destroying our government that the Word Republic has been forgotten, almost universally replaced by a misnomer called Democracy.  Our Founders gave us a Constitution designed to guide and restrain the actions of government.  Since law is harder to manipulate than people, the world government power elite have succeeded in convincing too many of our citizens that <a href="http://thedailybell.com/28119/Tibor-Machan-Unlimited-Democracy" target="_blank">we are a Democracy</a> and must abide by the will of the people.  The will of the people places the lesser half of society in tyranny to the remainder and in a nation like ours where the press is controlled, Democracy is a controllable sham.   WWIII is a war against national sovereignty.  On one side is the existing legal structure of the nations of the world, on the other side is the world power structure (one percent) seeking to make their word law.</p>
<p>While being destroyed socially and financially our nation is being used as a military unit to captivate the few remaining independent nation/states.   We are engaged in worldwide aggressive warfare under the aegis of bringing Democracy to the world and the “Democracy” we are intent on constructing will be controllable.  The same puppet masters that are pulling the strings of our government want to replicate it in other nations so their puppet show will have more characters.</p>
<p>American citizens who believe that working to elect one political party or the other can create a change in our nation are seriously deluded.  The candidates were pre-selected, the winner is controlled by the media that is owned by the power elite, votes are counted by machines that are made by the power elite, and the results are announced by media under the same control.  You can be sure the person elected will enter office with strings in the hands of the same puppet masters.</p>
<p>The loss of our industrial base depicts the massive power of the people that control our government and our lives.  Consider the blunt malevolent force needed to rob the world’s richest nation of a substantial portion of its wealth and do it with absolute impunity; the power to throw thousands of people out of work and to substantially reduce the standard of living of the entire middle class.  The power to reduce the life saving of millions of industrious workers to almost zero making it impossible for elderly Americans to enjoy the rewards of their sacrifice.  The power to obligate already victimized American citizens for trillions of dollars showered on banks owned by the robber barons while those same citizens drive their vehicles over pot holed roads and unsafe bridges.</p>
<p>We have allowed these denizens of darkness to render our Constitution anachronistic.  Our elected officials exist and function in a sea of mendacity, our media, an arm of the power elite, determines what we see and hear; and our government dances to our detriment.  We are fighting an unnecessary costly war and the government has made the populace dependent to an extent that cannot be sustained.  We are in serious trouble and many of us are still under the spell of the malevolent power structure.</p>
<p>Democracy has reached its destination; we are under the evil hand of tyranny. Time to wake up and hear the cry of dying freedom!</p>
<p>The end of Democracy is good; the end of freedom is bad!</p>

<p>For well over the last decade BATR has argued that the Republic is dead. Now that the Supreme Court has rendered their decision on Obamacare, there can be no doubt that the funeral for a nation, born out of a revolution for liberty, is over. The country, buried in the ashes of totalitarian despotism, is now history.</p>
<p>The plurality of citizens naively accepts that the national government has legitimacy. Such a claim is erroneous. What more proof does one need that slavery is the official status for the American public. The implication of affirming the health insurance mandate sets the precedent for and escalates an unlimited federal tyranny.</p>
<p>The twisted interpretation that a forced and binding purchase of medical coverage is justified because the government can tax its citizens is demonic in its inception. Coercion as a mean for compliance is like whipping your indentured servant for the privilege of serving the master.</p>
<p>By opening the flood-gate of unlimited federal taxation authority to compel behavior, guarantees punitive submission for a limitless concoction of social engineering. It is a short leap to require ID chip implants and compulsory designated conduct.</p>
<p>The hijacking of health care by a mandatory federal oppression pushes citizens to renounce their fidelity to a constitutional framework, already abandoned by the political power elite. Constrains and separation of the &#8220;Federalism&#8221; system of shared authority, is now eliminated. The central government is all-supreme in the gulag version of benevolent dependency.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is a pitiful tool of the executive autocrat that wheels administrative regulation like a crazed beast. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. is a disgrace. Whether his decision reflects intimidation or legacy hubris, the net effect is that he shoveled dirt on the tombstone of the constitution.</p>
<p>The seemingly limit on the commerce clause is circumvented by validating that taxing obligated conduct is legal. This extreme viewpoint condones any dictate by government fiat that Congress conspires to force people to obey. Such a conclusion abdicates the essence of constitutional protections.</p>
<p>Natural law is not arbitrary and subject to the whims of radical statists. Ignoring fundamental human rights is the definitive abuse against humanity. The federal government is making the nanny state into a chamber of horror.</p>
<p>Immutable principles that protect individuals from compulsory demands that violate free choice always are reprehensible. However, the latest rebuke to the sovereign dignity of citizens &#8211; poisons the water for any thirsty seeker of liberty and justice.</p>
<p>The consequences of the added financial costs from the Obamacare administration are frightening. The devil is in the details, never was more appropriate. Driving the economy off a cliff is a designed strategy of the collectivist criminals. The unholy alliance of big pharma, health insurance corporatists and dedicated Marxists want the public to be docile serfs in a land of slaves.</p>
<p>Add this dire result of the horrendous increase in taxes from the &#8220;Taxmageddon&#8221; catastrophe come the end of this year and you have a meltdown formula for a second depression. The Tea Party advocates are correct, &#8220;Taxed Enough Already&#8221; gains new meaning with the legalization of Obamacare.</p>
<p>Conversely, how can the legislation be legal when a Supreme Court that is determined to worship at the altar of an absolute tyranny violates the rule of law itself?</p>
<p>Incrementalism is the gradual assimilation of society into a different matrix of acceptability. This judicial tragedy is a rapid surge to the system. The body politic is under assault by a deadly virus of biblical dimensions. The core reasons for the War of American Independence seem trite when compared to the level of perdition experienced under the succession of recent presidents.</p>
<p>The bipartisan despotism of both Bush presidents, Clinton and now Obama only accelerate acquiescence to a virtual dictatorship. In order to understand the nature of the dilemma, appreciate the message in <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/070405.html">The Meaning of Independence Day</a>.</p>
<p>The justification for a Second American Revolution should be self-evident. However, there are few real Americans left, who comprehend the unique heritage of this nation. A spontaneous uprising to overthrow the political outlaws is unlikely. With that admission, the moral imperative still requires a personal commitment to oppose the corrupt regime that proceeds in enslaving society.</p>
<p>The tipping point is upon us. The chains you wear are shackles you lock each day; you observe, obey or consent to unlawful government. You have the power to refuse compliance. Confront the consequences or suffer the indignation of a life of servitude.</p>
<p>Celebrate this July 4th with a renewed dedication that the future of American lies in the moral authority of civil disobedience.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/drones-obama-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/drones-obama-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>The notorious Nixon hit list seems so placid when compared to the actual lethal force used by President Barack Obama, that one wonders how long it will be before the drone fleet turns their target munitions inside our own borders. The recent disclosure that Barry Soetoro, AKA, Barack Hussein Obama pours over a master list of threats against the establishment regime and picks the most dangerous candidates for surgical removal, demonstrates the care and precision used against &#8220;certified terrorists&#8221;. Such is the latest method of keeping the institutions of the &#8220;Homeland&#8221; safe from nasty combatants that challenge the officially recognized empire.</p>
<p>That bastion barrister of the rule of law, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/05/world/la-fg-holder-awlaki-20120306" target="_blank">Eric Holder</a>, clarifies the actions of the POTUS dictatorship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking to an audience at Northwestern University Law School, Holder gave the most complete explanation to date of the Obama administration&#8217;s legal rationale for killing people such as American-born Anwar Awlaki, who was targeted in a U.S. airstrike in Yemen last year.</p>
<p>Such killings can be ordered &#8220;in full accordance with the Constitution,&#8221; but it requires &#8220;at least&#8221; an imminent threat in a situation where capture is not feasible, and when the strike is &#8220;conducted in a manner consistent&#8221; with the rules of war, Holder said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this hour of danger,&#8221; Holder said, &#8220;we simply cannot afford to wait until deadly plans are carried out. And we will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrast the viewpoint of the Attorney General with that of the esteemed jurist, Judge Andrew P. Napolitano in the essay <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/andrew-p-napolitano/2012/05/30/the-secret-kill-list/" target="_blank">The Secret Kill List</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president cannot lawfully order the killing of anyone, except according to the Constitution and federal law. Under the Constitution, he can only order killing using the military when the U.S. has been attacked, or when an attack is so imminent and certain that delay would cost innocent American lives, or in pursuit of a congressional declaration of war. Under federal law, he can only order killing using civilians when a person has been sentenced lawfully to death by a federal court and the jury verdict and the death sentence have been upheld on appeal. If he uses the military to kill, federal law requires public reports of its use to Congress and congressional approval after 180 days.&#8221;</p>
<p>The predicament for the administration deepens with every attempt to uphold a failed foreign policy and a breach of basic bedrock constitutional protections. Toady proponents claim that Obama is a master speech deliverer, reading from a script of a grand design. Like another psychopath, skilled in rallying his sycophant supporters, Obama lacks a deep understanding of the repugnance in the rhetoric from the inconsistencies of the deeds.</p>
<p>In an article, <a href="http://emptywheel.firedoglake.com/2010/09/25/obama-doesnt-know-why-the-fuck-hes-entitled-to-kill-al-awlaki-he-just-is-damnit/" target="_blank">Obama Doesn’t Know Why He’s Entitled to Kill Al-Awlaki, He Just Is, Damnit</a>, poses a serious question about the targeted killing of Anwar al-Awlaki.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most striking aspect of the government’s <a href="http://static1.firedoglake.com/28/files/2010/09/100925-Al-Aulaqi-USG-PI-Opp-MTD-Brief-FILED.pdf" target="_blank">motion to dismiss</a> the ACLU/CCR lawsuit challenging the use of targeted killing is that the government does not commit to the basis for its authority to kill an American citizen like Anwar al-Awlaki with no review.</p>
<p>This starts as soon as the filing tries to lay the ground work for unchecked authority under the AUMF. It doesn’t commit to whether Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is part of al Qaeda itself, or is instead just closely enough associated to count under the AUMF.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The United States has further determined that AQAP is an organized armed group that is either part of al-Qaeda, or is an associated force, or cobelligerent, of al-Qaeda that has directed armed attacks against the United States in the noninternational armed conflict between the United States and al-Qaeda that the Supreme Court recognized in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 628-31 (2006).</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, as noted above, the Executive Branch has determined that AQAP is an organized armed group that is either part of al-Qaeda or, alternatively, is an organized associated force, or cobelligerent, of al-Qaeda that has directed attacks against the United States in the noninternational armed conflict between the United States and al-Qaeda that the Supreme Court has recognized (see Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 628-31).</em></p>
<p>Note the conclusion within this assessment:</p>
<p>&#8220;Though note the gigantic slip here: the AUMF only declares war against those &#8220;those nations, organizations, or persons [the President] determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons&#8221; (when AQAP didn’t exist in its current form), not those who have attacked us since. This &#8220;either/or&#8221; statement only claims that AQAP is part of the same war, not that it had any role in 9/11, so it’s totally bogus in any case, even without the betrayal of their lack of confidence in both of these claims with the either/or construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even under this tortured rationalization to fashion an argument that twists legal language, the depths of decadence to maintain the false flag justification for the terrorism fantasy says more about how far America has fallen than an actual threat to the nation.</p>
<p>Now that the droning of America has ramped up the mission for the total surveillance society, how long will it be before the &#8220;<em>rules of war</em>&#8221; apply within our own borders? The dire prospects of a second term Obama presidency loom over the skies with an ominous cloud.</p>
<p>Barack Obama’s actions are reminiscent of the arrogance and brutality of his Chicago criminal syndicate mentors. German propaganda equated the &#8220;<em>Chicago Typewriter</em>&#8221; Tommy gun style of brute force as proof of the real methods of the power elite.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the 1930&#8242;s the Nazi hierarchy became obsessed with sensational reports of the Chicago gangsters, Al Capone and his ilk. So when the Reichsminister of Propaganda wanted to demonize the British and American air forces, he combined the German word Luft (air) with &#8216;gangsters&#8217; and thus we were portrayed in the German press. Just as we laughed at the Nazi propaganda tools, Lord Haw Haw and Axis Sally, and enjoyed the music they beamed at us (remember Lili Marlene?) so we reveled in the title of <a href="http://www.readinkbooks.com/?page=shop/flypage&amp;product_id=11033&amp;CLSN_897=1290235779897a086e4778c4cd162d41" target="_blank">Luftgangster</a>&#8220;.While the drone fleet analogy applies and Obama’s grandiose skills resemble the pomposity of the Führer, he really is a closet Joseph Stalin at heart.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://theobamafile.com/_opinion/GangsterGovernment.htm" target="_blank">Obama File</a> describes him in this manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Obama is not just a Marxist. He&#8217;s a unique hybrid. He&#8217;s a Marxist for sure, but he&#8217;s also a professional activist, completely in tune with the American Political Left and the goals of the Socialist International. He spent years teaching the US Constitution, but he certainly wasn&#8217;t teaching constitutional law from a strict constructionist point of view.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an in-depth resource on Obama’s communists sympathies and ties, examine the <a href="http://commieblaster.com/obama/index.html" target="_blank">commieblaster</a> site. The basic lesson is that both Hitler and Stalin were twins in depravity. Both had their own &#8220;Kill Lists&#8221; and together caused the deaths of millions of innocent citizens within their own countries. The Statist-Fascism that is engulfing America is all around us. The masses that goose stepped over the cliff or cried at &#8220;Uncle Joe’s&#8221; funeral were not real patriots, but were fools. Americans who are &#8220;<em>Stuck On Stupid</em>&#8221; and refuse to admit that the entire 911 <a href="http://batr.org/911/" target="_blank">War of Terror</a> is a manufactured excuse to militarize our own version of a police state, bear the shame and blame for the end of the Republic. Currently the latest Bilderberg confluence is plotting and implementing efforts and policies that will result in your demise. The &#8220;Killer Elite&#8221; is just as much a culture as a squad of hired assassins. The drone deployment of the military domestically is a clear violation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act" target="_blank">Posse Comitatus</a>. The rule of law has been abandoned, and replaced with the reign of tyrants.</p>
<p>A comprehensive hit list, compiled nationwide, is growing because moral patriots are becoming more active and forthright in confronting an illegal government. For the rest of the sedated zombies that still believe that the federal despotism is legitimate, the buzzing of spies in the skies will become a reminder that every action is now subject to scrutiny.</p>
<p>Many will exhort the elimination of Anwar Awlaki. But, will they still cheer, when the lightening bolts, start to rain down inside the country? Ignoring due process out of a phony and trumped up pretext means that anyone and everyone is subject to arbitrary liquidation if the killer elites decide you are a threat to their New World Order.</p>
<p>Domestic surveillance, designed for a sinister purpose, has dangerous implications. Obama’s Chicago gang of gangsters and their integration into the military-industrial-security complex may well prove the ranting of Lord Haw Haw correct. If Nazism and Communism were the two great evils of the last century, how do you explain that our federal government is in the final stages of adopting the worse of both systems?</p>
<p>It is just a matter of time until you are slated for a place in a FEMA facility. Or maybe, if you have tremendous courage, make the next cut for Obama’s hit list. America is in peril from within and flying the friendly drone skies does not make us safe.</p>

<p align="left">In Robert E. Gamer’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developing-Nations-A-Comparative-Perspective/dp/0697067971/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336881002&amp;sr=1-6">“The Developing Nations”</a> is a chapter called “Why Men Do Not Revolt.” In it Gamer notes that although the oppressed often do revolt, the object of their hostility is misplaced. They vent their fury on a political puppet, someone who masks colonial power, a despised racial or ethnic group or an apostate within their own political class. The useless battles serve as an effective mask for what Gamer calls the “patron-client” networks that are responsible for the continuity of colonial oppression. The squabbles among the oppressed, the political campaigns between candidates who each are servants of colonial power, Gamer writes, absolve the actual centers of power from addressing the conditions that cause the frustrations of the people. Inequities, political disenfranchisement and injustices are never seriously addressed. “The government merely does the minimum necessary to prevent those few who are prone toward political action from organizing into politically effective groups,” he writes.</p>
<p align="left">Gamer and many others who study the nature of colonial rule offer the best insights into the functioning of our corporate state. We have been, like nations on the periphery of empire, colonized. We are controlled by tiny corporate entities that have no loyalty to the nation and indeed in the language of traditional patriotism are traitors. They strip us of our resources, keep us politically passive and enrich themselves at our expense. The mechanisms of control are familiar to those whom the Martinique-born French psychiatrist and writer Frantz Fanon called “the wretched of the earth,” including African-Americans. The colonized are denied job security. Incomes are reduced to subsistence level. The poor are plunged into desperation. Mass movements, such as labor unions, are dismantled. The school system is degraded so only the elites have access to a superior education. Laws are written to legalize corporate plunder and abuse, as well as criminalize dissent. And the ensuing fear and instability—keenly felt this past weekend by the more than 200,000 Americans who lost their unemployment benefits—ensure political passivity by diverting all personal energy toward survival. It is an old, old game.</p>
<p align="left">A change of power does not require the election of a Mitt Romney or a Barack Obama or a Democratic majority in Congress, or an attempt to reform the system or electing progressive candidates, but rather a destruction of corporate domination of the political process—Gamer’s “patron-client” networks. It requires the establishment of new mechanisms of governance to distribute wealth and protect resources, to curtail corporate power, to cope with the destruction of the ecosystem and to foster the common good. But we must first recognize ourselves as colonial subjects. We must accept that we have no effective voice in the way we are governed. We must accept the hollowness of electoral politics, the futility of our political theater, and we must destroy the corporate structure itself.</p>
<p align="left">The danger the corporate state faces does not come from the poor. The poor, those Karl Marx dismissed as the <a href="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/lumpenproletariat">Lumpenproletariat</a>, do not mount revolutions, although they join them and often become cannon fodder. The real danger to the elite comes from <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/declasse">déclassé</a> intellectuals, those educated middle-class men and women who are barred by a calcified system from advancement. Artists without studios or theaters, teachers without classrooms, lawyers without clients, doctors without patients and journalists without newspapers descend economically. They become, as they mingle with the underclass, a bridge between the worlds of the elite and the oppressed. And they are the dynamite that triggers revolt.</p>
<p align="left">This is why the Occupy movement frightens the corporate elite. What fosters revolution is not misery, but the gap between what people expect from their lives and what is offered. This is especially acute among the educated and the talented. They feel, with much justification, that they have been denied what they deserve. They set out to rectify this injustice. And the longer the injustice festers, the more radical they become.</p>
<p align="left">The response of a dying regime—and our corporate regime is dying—is to employ increasing levels of force, and to foolishly refuse to ameliorate the chronic joblessness, foreclosures, mounting student debt, lack of medical insurance and exclusion from the centers of power. Revolutions are fueled by an inept and distant ruling class that perpetuates political paralysis. This ensures its eventual death.</p>
<p align="left">In every revolutionary movement I covered in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, the leadership emerged from déclassé intellectuals. The leaders were usually young or middle-aged, educated and always unable to meet their professional and personal aspirations. They were never part of the power elite, although often their parents had been. They were conversant in the language of power as well as the language of oppression. It is the presence of large numbers of déclassé intellectuals that makes the uprisings in Spain, Egypt, Greece and finally the United States threatening to the overlords at Goldman Sachs, ExxonMobil and JPMorgan Chase. They must face down opponents who understand, in a way the uneducated often do not, the lies disseminated on behalf of corporations by the public relations industry. These déclassé intellectuals, because they are conversant in economics and political theory, grasp that those who hold power, real power, are not the elected mandarins in Washington but the criminal class on Wall Street.</p>
<p align="left">This is what made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_x">Malcolm X</a> so threatening to the white power structure. He refused to countenance Martin Luther King’s fiction that white power and white liberals would ever lift black people out of economic squalor. King belatedly came to share Malcolm’s view. Malcolm X named the enemy. He exposed the lies. And until we see the corporate state, and the games it is playing with us, with the same kind of clarity, we will be nothing more than useful idiots.</p>
<p align="left">“This is an era of hypocrisy,” Malcolm X said. “When white folks pretend that they want Negroes to be free, and Negroes pretend to white folks that they really believe that white folks want ’em to be free, it’s an era of hypocrisy, brother. You fool me and I fool you. You pretend that you’re my brother and I pretend that I really believe you believe you’re my brother.”</p>
<p align="left">Those within a demoralized ruling elite, like characters in a Chekhov play, increasingly understand that the system that enriches and empowers them is corrupt and decayed. They become cynical. They do not govern effectively. They retreat into hedonism. They no longer believe their own rhetoric. They devote their energies to stealing and exploiting as much, as fast, as possible. They pillage their own institutions, as we have seen with the newly disclosed loss of $2 billion within JPMorgan Chase, the meltdown of <a href="http://wizbangblog.com/2012/04/19/chesapeake-energy-ceo-in-hot-water-again/">Chesapeake Energy Corp.</a> or the collapse of Enron and Lehman Brothers. The elites become cannibals. They consume each other. This is what happens in the latter stages of all dying regimes. Louis XIV pillaged his own nobility by revoking <a href="http://sawaal.ibibo.com/politics/what-patents-nobility-1639642.html">patents of nobility</a> and reselling them. It is what most corporations do to their shareholders. A dying ruling class, in short, no longer acts to preserve its own longevity. It becomes fashionable, even in the rarefied circles of the elite, to ridicule and laugh at the political puppets that are the public face of the corporate state.</p>
<p align="left">“Ideas that have outlived their day may hobble about the world for years,” <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSherzen.htm">Alexander Herzen</a> wrote, “but it is hard for them ever to lead and dominate life. Such ideas never gain complete possession of a man, or they gain possession only of incomplete people.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">This loss of faith means that when it comes time to use force, the elites employ it haphazardly and inefficiently, in large part because they are unsure of the loyalty of the foot soldiers on the streets charged with carrying out repression.</p>
<p align="left">Revolutions take time. The American Revolution began with protests against the Stamp Act of 1765 but did not erupt until a decade later. The 1917 revolution in Russia started with a dress rehearsal in 1905. The most effective revolutions, including the Russian Revolution, have been largely nonviolent. There are always violent radicals who carry out bombings and assassinations, but they hinder, especially in the early stages, more than help revolutions. The anarchist <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/peter-kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> during the Russian Revolution condemned the radical terrorists, asserting that they only demoralized and frightened away the movement’s followers and discredited authentic anarchism.</p>
<p align="left">Radical violent groups cling like parasites to popular protests. The Black Panthers, the American Indian Movement, the Weather Underground, the Red Brigades and the Symbionese Liberation Army arose in the ferment of the 1960s. Violent radicals are used by the state to justify harsh repression. They scare the mainstream from the movement. They thwart the goal of all revolutions, which is to turn the majority against an isolated and discredited ruling class. These violent fringe groups are seductive to those who yearn for personal empowerment through hyper-masculinity and violence, but they do little to advance the cause. The primary role of radical extremists, such as Maximilien Robespierre and Vladimir Lenin, is to hijack successful revolutions. They unleash a reign of terror, primarily against fellow revolutionaries, which often outdoes the repression of the old regime. They often do not play much of a role in building a revolution.</p>
<p align="left">The power of the Occupy movement is that it expresses the widespread disgust with the elites, and the deep desire for justice and fairness that is essential to all successful revolutionary movements. The Occupy movement will change and mutate, but it will not go away. It may appear to make little headway, but this is less because of the movement’s ineffectiveness and more because decayed systems of power have an amazing ability to perpetuate themselves through habit, routine and inertia. The press and organs of communication, along with the anointed experts and academics, tied by money and ideology to the elites, are useless in dissecting what is happening within these movements. They view reality through the lens of their corporate sponsors. They have no idea what is happening.</p>
<p align="left">Dying regimes are chipped away slowly and imperceptibly. The assumptions and daily formalities of the old system are difficult for citizens to abandon, even when the old system is increasingly hostile to their dignity, well-being and survival. Supplanting an old faith with a new one is the silent, unseen battle of all revolutionary movements. And during the slow transition it is almost impossible to measure progress.</p>
<p align="left">“Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong,” Fanon wrote in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Skin,_White_Masks">“Black Skin, White Masks.”</a> “When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn’t fit in with the core belief.”</p>
<p align="left">The end of these regimes comes when old beliefs die and the organs of security, especially the police and military, abandon the elites and join the revolutionaries. This is true in every successful revolution. It does not matter how sophisticated the repressive apparatus. Once those who handle the tools of repression become demoralized, the security and surveillance state is impotent. Regimes, when they die, are like a great ocean liner sinking in minutes on the horizon. And no one, including the purported leaders of the opposition, can predict the moment of death. Revolutions have an innate, mysterious life force that defies comprehension. They are living entities.</p>
<p align="left">The defection of the security apparatus is often done with little or no violence, as I witnessed in Eastern Europe in 1989 and as was also true in 1979 in Iran and in 1917 in Russia. At other times, when it has enough residual force to fight back, the dying regime triggers a violent clash as it did in the American Revolution when soldiers and officers in the British army, including George Washington, rebelled to raise the Continental Army. Violence also characterized the 1949 Chinese revolution led by Mao Zedong. But even revolutions that turn violent succeed, as Mao conceded, because they enjoy popular support and can mount widespread protests, strikes, agitation, revolutionary propaganda and acts of civil disobedience. The object is to try to get there without violence. Armed revolutions, despite what the history books often tell us, are tragic, ugly, frightening and sordid affairs. Those who storm Bastilles, as the Polish dissident Adam Michnik wrote, “unwittingly build new ones.” And once revolutions turn violent it becomes hard to speak of victors and losers.</p>
<p align="left">A revolution has been unleashed across the globe. This revolution, a popular repudiation of the old order, is where we should direct all our energy and commitment.  If we do not topple the corporate elites the ecosystem will be destroyed and massive numbers of human beings along with it. The struggle will be long. There will be times when it will seem we are going nowhere. Victory is not inevitable. But this is our best and only hope. The response of the corporate state will ultimately determine the parameters and composition of rebellion. I pray we replicate the 1989 nonviolent revolutions that overthrew the communist regimes in Eastern Europe. But this is not in my hands or yours. Go ahead and vote this November. But don’t waste any more time or energy on the presidential election than it takes to get to your polling station and pull a lever for a third-party candidate—just enough to register your obstruction and defiance—and then get back out onto the street. That is where the question of real power is being decided.</p>

<h2 align="left">Let Your Life Be a Friction to Stop the Machine&#8230;</h2>
<p>Nightmare and insanity are akin: mysterious and involuntary states that skew and distort objective reality. One wakens from nightmare; from insanity there is no awakening.</p>
<p>Whether Americans live in the one state or the other is the paramount question of this era.</p>
<p>For two hundred years Americans have been indoctrinated with a mythology created, imposed and sustained by a manipulating cabal: the financial elite that built its absolute control on the muscle and blood, good will, ignorance and credulity, of its citizenry.</p>
<p>America began with the invasion of a populated continent and the genocide of its native people. Once solidly established, it grafted enslavement of another race onto that base.</p>
<p>With those two pillars of state firmly in place it declared itself an independent nation in a document that nobly proclaimed the equality of all mankind.</p>
<p>In that act of monumental hypocrisy America’s myth had its beginning.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A Constitution was written that came to be regarded as American Holy Writ. Its central purposes were to defend private property and suppress mass democracy. It has fulfilled both those mandates beyond the wildest dreams of its creators.</p>
<p>Once the existing oligarchy was secure in law and native people largely exterminated, the ruling class increased its wealth and power fantastically in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, using the government as its enabler, exploiting to the limit the device of chartered corporations.</p>
<p>With its phenomenal money power, the financial elite began to use the military to expand its sway beyond the continent. Regions, territories, islands, and whole countries were annexed, invaded, and possessed outright, their peoples crushed, suppressed, and ruled.</p>
<p>Because ordinary Americans, like any people, need to believe that whatever the ruling elite undertakes in their nation’s name must be essentially benevolent, noble in purpose and justified in fact, the myth had to be radically modified for imperial expansion.</p>
<p>The foundational story was that Americans had come to a howling wilderness teeming with godless savages and, through invincible strength of character and purity of purpose, had tamed the land and honorably earned the right to possess their bountiful home.</p>
<p>In the era of extra-territorial expansion that version was polished to justify and ennoble imperialism. The new corollary was that America could not ignore colonialist brutality but was obliged, by the Manifest Destiny that led us to civilize our own continent, to carry our mission into barbaric darkness wherever tyranny created abuse and suffering.</p>
<p>A national myth that absolutely binds the loyalty of a people to its government must be a subtle and powerful elixir that elevates and aggrandizes that people’s self-regard. National policy will then appear to be an extension of its superior citizenry’s inchoate will, and the basis for a justified arrogance toward the lesser world.</p>
<p>The simple, powerful myth of America’s altruistic and heroic benevolence, shaped and maintained by the financial/political power elite, infused Americans with a deep and outrageously hubristic sense of racial superiority that, mobilized behind various imperial enterprises, has given all such adventures the character of a quasi-religious crusade. In this way insatiable imperialism acquires the apparent moral perfection of a syllogism.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>With WWII, the world was reconfigured. American Capitalism emerged supreme from the horror that had virtually wrecked its capitalist partners. The Soviet Union, though, having absorbed by far the greatest devastation from Nazi Germany, had astonishingly risen above its ruin to become the leading challenger to America as a world power.</p>
<p>This challenge was not competitive, it was systemic: Soviet Communism was a direct threat to American hegemony in that it categorically refuted the philosophical basis of Predatory Capitalism. Grounded in Marx and Lenin, it attacked Capitalism’s inherent evils, monstrous inequities and flagrant injustices that, exacerbated by speculation, exploitation and fraud, would destroy it. And it promoted world revolution to that end.</p>
<p>This face-off of giants in the Cold War necessitated further refinement of the American myth. Now, instead of simply intervening in situations where despotism or tyranny required America to forcefully implant our just and ethical democracy, America had to become the shield and bulwark of the sacred capitalist system in which “free enterprise” was magically and increasingly identified with democracy and equally to be defended.</p>
<p>This version prevailed through many surrogate confrontations around the globe in the era of Mutually Assured Destruction and survived even the debacle of Vietnam, lasting until the collapse of the Soviet Union, as the propaganda stream became ever more intense and pervasive. On radio and television Americans were subjected to an unrelenting barrage of hyper-patriotism in which American moral superiority was a given, and America’s self-touted courage, generosity and decency were its unchallengeable proofs.</p>
<p>The implosion of the Soviet Union left America, in its own terminology, the “Sole Superpower in a Unipolar World”. This, however, did not result in diminution of the myth. The practical effect of having no doomsday enemy&#8211;China couldn’t plausibly be cast in that role then&#8211;was to supercharge it by increasing its element of pure, hubristic ego. America was no longer just called upon to defend the “Free World” from monstrous heresy; it was now, by virtue of its universally acknowledged, beatific “exceptionalism”, required to oversee and police it in the interests, and for the benefit, of lesser nations.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Power corrupts”, said Lord Mahan, “and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”</p>
<p>When the only rival and counterweight to American power disintegrated there was a sense within the American power elite that the opportunity existed, for the first time in history, for one country to absolutely dominate and effectively control the entire world.</p>
<p>This consensus was expressed in a policy statement composed by a cadre of major right-wing political players representing massive corporate capitalist interests called the Project for a New American Century. This triumphalist manifesto laid out a plan for absolute American access and control of essential resources and raw materials worldwide, to be guaranteed by the military which would enforce Full Spectrum Dominance.</p>
<p>The American Myth, which had seemed to have lost momentum and its animating principle in the totally unexpected so-called Cold War “victory”, was now re-energized with a less defensive and reactive essence, and given the glowing radiance and patina of a true and, for the first time, self-professed and articulated, imperial mission.</p>
<p>The attack on the Towers, an unimaginable provocation, was the trigger mechanism for the explosive launch of the effort to impose that imperial model in practice on the world.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It has been without question the most spectacular failure in the history of American misadventure. After a decade marked by the waste of trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of American lives, the stunning bankruptcy of our internally burglarized nation, and a consequent recession more fundamentally damaging than the Great One, Imperial America has nothing to show for the botched folly of its arrogant overreach but unequivocal disasters in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with no end of madness in sight.</p>
<p>An impartial observer would have to say that the hypnotic hold of the American Myth on the loyalty of the people has led only to disgrace and disaster, and set a direct course to inevitable imperial decline and ruin. That would be inarguable on any rational basis, but it entirely mistakes the motive for, and the purpose of, the myth. The American Myth was never intended to serve the interests either of our country or of our people: it was created solely to buttress, shield, and exalt the ruling financial class. It has done that with astonishing and unbroken success that staggers the imagination from our earliest days.</p>
<p>The massive looting of Iraq/Afghanistan/Pakistan war funding to enrich the Corporate Tyranny—for that is what it has become—is on an unique scale of its own, without anything remotely comparable to its flagrant obscenity in the whole long history of war.</p>
<p>Neither the Pentagon nor any branch of the U.S. government can give any accounting whatever of the many billions of tax-generated dollars that have vanished, evaporated. There is no doubt but that beyond the outrageously inflated, no-bid contracts handed to giant corporate favorites with their preposterous guaranteed profits, much of the money was simply stolen in bulk by, through, or in spite of the military, and distributed among thieves and accomplices, some of it on huge pallets… for convenience, presumably.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>While this wholesale robbery was going on under the oversight of the military abroad, the Corporate Tyranny had evolved a whole set of impenetrably complex devices for the generation of money without any economically productive source or result at home.</p>
<p>The sole driving force and purpose of Capitalism is the realization of profit. According to that calculus, reducing production costs increases profit margin. This leads to the obvious conclusion that as production costs near zero, profit is maximized.</p>
<p>There is no provision for social good in Capitalist theory. Corporations, created to optimize business opportunity through efficient specialization, were originally required to operate for public benefit but that provision was quickly finessed and forgotten.</p>
<p>American law courts have always favored corporate concentrations of wealth since they, like the Congress, exist to serve the moneyed interests. The American Myth was created to provide cover for the financial oligarchy to exploit the country and the citizenry, and the judiciary has consistently cooperated in ruling for corporations against the people.</p>
<p>Indeed, without ever considering the question in law, the Supreme Court long ago endowed corporations with “personhood”, that is with all rights of human beings under our Constitution. The way this travesty occurred&#8211;the slipshod by-product of an obliquely related case&#8211;shows that the court preferred to incorporate this perversion of the plain intent of the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment as an unexamined assumption rather than risk an eventual test which would unquestionably have created violent public outrage.</p>
<p>Given the collusion of Congress and the courts in securing legal invulnerability for the Corporate Tyranny and the principle that the only duty of corporations is maximization of profit, it was not surprising that megabanks, huge brokerage houses, giant insurance conglomerates, gilded hedge funds and the credit agencies pretending to certify their work, all engaged in massive and systemic fraud and deception for just that purpose. The result was the crash of ’08, the recession, and the stunning and unprecedented rescue and bailout of the biggest banks, investment houses, and insurance and credit conglomerates with taxpayer dollars. So much for the hallowed Invisible Hand of the Free Market…</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The last decades have seen two related megatrends in American geopolitical mechanics, both with dire effects on the power of the American Myth. First, what belief the world at large had in it has been shattered by a catastrophic series of imbecile and irretrievable military failures and disasters, which has caused erosion of its efficacy at home. Second, in response to this, the State has made increasingly crude efforts to boost the Myth’s waning power by the imposition of totalitarian methods of surveillance, intimidation and coercion on the American people to a degree unprecedented in scope and scale.</p>
<p>The whole clanking, medieval apparatus of Homeland Security that has sprouted like an enormous poison fungus since 9/11 with its brutal police state mindset; the odious Patriot Act with its flagrant subversions of the Bill of Rights; the endless, fantasy-based terror-peddling of the prostitute corporate media with its clowns and harpies churning irrational fear and anger in the uninformed: all this grim, repressive endeavor is a concerted attempt to distract Americans from the real causes of their injury, abuse, and oppression.</p>
<p>And yet, even with the American Myth now totally and irreparably blown full of holes and exposed demonstrably for the tissue of lies, deceptions and frauds that it has always been, it somehow keeps its phenomenal hold on the great mass of the American people. The tragic reality is that, for the majority, their own identities have been so deeply and thoroughly infused with the myth that to disbelieve it is to disbelieve in themselves.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>So the American Myth is dead, and yet it lives on in its deadness, horribly masking our crapshot economy, our bankrupt debtors prison of a society, our Ghost Dance charade of kabuki democracy, while typhoons of impending social, economic and ecological disaster build their enormous, lightning-charged thunderheads above the dark future before us.</p>
<p>And what is it that the dead Myth still imperfectly obscures for Americans? What is outside and beyond the opaque wall of faltering, failing dishonesty and deception? What is the horror that the shoddy, tattered Myth has so long and so effectively concealed?</p>
<p>It is the world that has suffered unrelieved exploitation by the violence of our imperialist mania. It is the many wrecked and pillaged economies financially looted by our imposed predatory capitalist austerity regimes. It is the teeming hundreds of millions of starved, deprived and dying children sacrificed to Wall Street commodities gaming. It is the multitudes of humble, innocent, ignorant people, barely surviving in absolutist and dictatorial regimes propped up in their barbaric cruelty by our military while our banks siphon off the profits left after arming their brutal police and armies and bribing their ruling Kings, Sheikhs or Generals. It is the millions of dead and maimed in the raped populations of simple tribal people whom our indiscriminately murderous juggernaut has left in its bloody wake in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. It is the appalling legacy of hate and repulsion, disdain and fear, that America has earned with its appalling hegemonist villainy in every corner of the world.</p>
<p>And at home, what is it we Americans have been so complicit in hiding from ourselves in our devotion to the perverse legend that has come to inhabit our souls like a succubus?</p>
<p>It is the millions of us with no work and no hope in middle age whose jobs and homes have been devoured by the heartless fraud machine of Wall Street. It is the trashed and demolished weedlots of our major cities eroding in crumbling, fire-gutted ruin. It is the many towns and cities with industries shut down and factories deserted or dismantled and shipped overseas. It is our decaying, disintegrating public schools, our bankrupt states and counties, our overtaxed, antiquated public transportation systems, our obsolete, dissolving infrastructure, our bloated, irrational prisons complex, our punishing and inadequate health care disaster, and over it all, the repressive mechanism of our police state, armed and empowered, ready for use against the American people themselves.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>This is where we are. The great question now is whether we as a nation can awaken from this long historic nightmare and face the terrifying and exhilarating prospect of living in the full light of reality without the false props and dishonest constructs of a hoodwinked, herded and dishonored people or, whether we have internalized the falsity and disease to such an extent that it has become an organic, overmastering form of insanity?</p>
<p>In 1846, Henry David Thoreau, offended to his soul by the injustice of the American government’s invasion of Mexico, protested it and went to jail for his convictions. Later, in his essay On Civil Disobedience, he said this:</p>
<p>“If injustice is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter friction to stop the machine.”</p>
<p>To attempt to break the hold of the American Myth will be a titanic, daunting challenge. To even begin to openly rebel against the might of the National Security State will require the courage to face much more than official disapproval and denunciation. Imperial America will not respond to even the most peaceful and orderly protest with anything less than hard police repression and the level of punishment will rise in relation to the scope and seriousness of the action undertaken.</p>
<p>Small protests will have no effect and will be meaningless. Organized mass events, when they occur, will draw the whole fiercely and brutally motivated National Security State apparatus down upon themselves. Americans, excepting those of our underclass who have felt it, have no experience with violent police or military repression. Those who commit peaceful civil disobedience, a first and innocent tactic of serious protest, will swiftly find out to their cost how it works. In a National Security State that has excised and eradicated all defensive laws and regulations intended to prevent abuse of the public, whatever the State does is legal. To such a pass have we in America come as a result of our long historic indoctrination in serving our financial elite, our Ruling Class.</p>
<p>To achieve any redemption for Americans, to make possible any more just, humane and life-honoring society, will require complete abandonment of the system of Predatory Capitalism. If offers no prospect of reform or improvement and we have all been witness to the idiocy of the so-called “democratic process” in action for generations now.</p>
<p>America is nearing the greatest crisis point in its history and the terrific cataclysm, when it happens, will determine the future our country is to have. If we cannot, in dominating numbers, rise to reject the heartless, mindless, soulless machine of Imperial Predatory Capitalism, we will be condemned to a fascistic command and control horror in which human beings are mere possessions of the State, units of production or service, and then perhaps not even that, as excess population in that brave, new world nay be eliminated.</p>
<p>That end is not inevitable. We are not lost. We are not even defeated because to this moment we have not engaged. We have not honored our responsibility as human beings. We have not risen to defend our humanity. We have let ourselves be ruled.</p>
<p>All around the world the thunder of vast and immeasurable discontent can be heard and felt. In Egypt and Spain, Jordan and Greece, Iraq and Sudan, Afghanistan and Ireland, Latin America, the Far East and Africa, the legitimate anger of humanity is expressing itself against the dead and killing hand of Predatory Capitalism and its agencies of violence. And here, in America, so long trapped and encapsulated, frozen like a fly in amber in a false religion of state idolatry, the anger is deep, widespread, and growing.</p>
<p>It is up to those who know and care to lead. As Thomas Paine said, “These are the times that try men’s souls.” Nothing is guaranteed us. That can’t matter. We cannot be concerned with odds or outcomes. We cannot let the Machine of Injustice grind on. We must oppose it with all the moral force we own. We must act with quiet courage to confront a vicious tyrannical system that is destroying the earth, its life, and its people. We must put our lives on the line to oppose it.</p>
<p>The Nightmare Machine of rapacious exploitation has overthrown humanity’s decency and reason and its bloody inhuman treason flourishes over us. This must be ended.</p>
<p>Let your life be a friction now to stop the Machine.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ron-paul-close-up3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ron-paul-close-up2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>It is no secret that I am a huge Ron Paul fan–and I have been for many years. Do I agree with him on every single issue? Of course not. And I don’t have to agree with him on every single issue to know Ron Paul is the only true constitutionalist in the Presidential field–from either major party. And when a President (or any other public office holder) takes his or her oath of office, they do not swear to be a good conservative, or to be a good Christian, or to support the state of Israel, or to “create jobs,” etc., etc. They swear to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. That is their solemn oath before God and the American people. Nothing more. Nothing less. And for over two decades, Congressman Ron Paul has demonstrated his fidelity to that oath. And for that, I can and must support him.</p>
<p>In spite of Dr. Paul’s stellar congressional record, however, there are large numbers of Republicans and “conservatives” that are his fiercest critics. I’ve even heard some “conservatives” say that they would rather see Barack Obama reelected than for Ron Paul to become President. Such is the lunacy of many so-called “conservatives” today.</p>
<p>So, what is it about Ron Paul’s detractors that cause them to despise him so much? What is their beef? They would never say that they would rather Obama be reelected than to see Mitt Romney, or Newt Gingrich, or Rick Santorum elected President. In fact, most of them spout the antiquated mantra, “Anybody but the Democrat (whoever it happens to be at the time).” Or, “At least Romney, Gingrich, Santorum, etc., won’t take us over the cliff quite as fast as Obama.” But when discussing Ron Paul, many “conservatives” take the position, “Anybody but Ron Paul.” Why is this? What is it about this good man that so many good people can have such animosity toward him?</p>
<p>I am convinced that these “conservatives” who oppose Ron Paul reveal much more about themselves than they do about Dr. Paul. Let me proffer a few observations.</p>
<p>Observation Number One: We Have A Constitutionally Illiterate Society</p>
<p>Many “conservatives” are woefully ignorant of the US Constitution, and when a constitutional scholar such as Ron Paul interjects the Constitution into the political debate, he is speaking a language that many of these “conservatives” simply do not understand. He might as well be speaking Spanish or French. To many “conservatives,” the Constitution is a foreign language.</p>
<p>For the better part of the Twentieth Century, the Constitution was ignored and neglected. Pastors have never studied the Constitution. Businessmen have never studied it. High school teachers and college professors have never studied it. Policemen and sheriff deputies have never studied it. Even attorneys and judges haven’t studied the Constitution. Let’s be honest: we have a constitutionally illiterate society today. As a result of this constitutional ignorance, people (including Christians and “conservatives”) simply cannot fathom–much less appreciate–constitutional solutions to America’s political woes.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul knows the Constitution. He has studied it. He has read what America’s Founding Fathers and framers have written about the Constitution. He has studied the enlightenment philosophers, theologians, and teachers–you know, the same ones that Thomas Jefferson and James Madison studied. He knows that the reason America is in the mess it is in today is because the Constitution has been abandoned. And he also knows that the only way to fix it (politically) is to return to constitutional governance.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Dr. Paul talks about drugs, foreign policy, military adventurism, or even social issues, he does so from a constitutional point of reference. And the Constitution is clear when it comes to these matters. Domestic drug laws are the exclusive responsibility of the states–as is virtually every other law enforcement matter. Foreign entanglements, empire building, turning our military personnel into the world’s policemen, etc., are all anathema to constitutional government. And the longer our political leaders continue to ignore the Constitution, the more America will continue to slide down this slippery slope in which we now find ourselves.</p>
<p>Ron Paul’s position on these matters is in historical agreement with America’s Founding Fathers and the US Constitution. The following report outlines Dr. Paul’s sagacity regarding so-called “social conservatism” and the proper role of constitutional government (the title of the news report notwithstanding):</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/82slxzf">http://tinyurl.com/82slxzf</a></p>
<p>Dr. Paul’s detractors demonstrate that they do not truly understand the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Observation Number Two: Many “Conservatives” Have A Misguided Perception Of Ron Paul’s Position On The State Of Israel.</p>
<p>How many times have we heard Dr. Paul’s critics say that Ron Paul is “against Israel”? Too many times to count. I have been with Ron Paul in public and private many times, and I have never heard the first anti-Semitic word come out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Theologically speaking, you could not get a consensus of opinion from among the leading Biblical scholars and theologians regarding the modern state of Israel and Biblical prophecy if your life depended upon it. Many sincere Christians believe that the Biblical promises to Israel have all taken place in history past. Many sincere Christians believe that there are many promises to Israel that are yet future. And of these groups, many believe that the modern state of Israel is the fulfillment of Bible prophecy, while many others believe that the modern state of Israel has no relationship whatsoever to the future Davidic Kingdom. And the fact is, when it comes to America’s foreign policy, it doesn’t matter!</p>
<p>Constitutionally, the President of the United States owes his loyalty and allegiance to only one country: The United States of America. He has no right to interfere with the internal affairs of any country–including Israel. He has no authority to give trillions of dollars of hard-earned taxpayer dollars of foreign aid to any country–including Israel. When Americans go to the polls this November, they will elect the President of the United States, not the Prime Minister of Israel. As far as any American President is concerned, Israel, like every other nation, should be judged on the basis of its actions, good or bad (as should our own nation be judged). Any American President should do everything in his power to cultivate peaceful trade relations with foreign countries, and to protect America’s people and territory from those nations that would attempt to harm us–no matter who that nation is.</p>
<p>Ron Paul’s position on Israel is a constitutional one. He knows the US should stop meddling in her affairs and let her govern herself as she sees fit. Israel is a sovereign, independent nation fully capable of conducting her own affairs. What is amazing to me about so much of this Israel debate is the way many Christians ignore the fact that for every dollar the US gives to Israel, it gives at least four dollars to her Arab neighbors. Tell me again how this “blesses” Israel? How has America’s foreign policy of manipulation and coercion into the political and commercial affairs of nations throughout the world (including the Middle East) “blessed” Israel–or any other nation, for that matter? Can anyone remember when Iran was our friend? And who was it that cut the legs out from under that friend and elevated a government that would become hostile to both the United States and Israel? The US State Department, that’s who! Who orchestrated the rise to power of both Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein? The US State Department, CIA, etc., that’s who! Who has repeatedly demanded that Israel swap “land for peace”? Various US Presidents and Secretaries of State, that’s who! And what is currently stirring the pot of strife and hostility in the Middle East today? An interventionist US foreign policy, that’s what!</p>
<p>It is no accident that Ron Paul receives more support from American military personnel, active and retired, than all other GOP Presidential candidates combined. See this report:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/7gk9c4o">http://tinyurl.com/7gk9c4o</a></p>
<p>No matter what one’s personal view of Biblical eschatology may be, the President of the United States is obligated to put the interests and safety of the people of the United States first! Period! How dare any President pander to ANY foreign country? How dare any President elevate ANY foreign nation to a position superior to the United States? And how dare any American citizen expect that our President would do either?</p>
<p>Observation Number Three: Ron Paul’s Detractors Must Not Comprehend The Existence Of The New World Order (NWO).</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, ever since the Woodrow Wilson administration, the United States has been increasingly under the influence of internationalists who desire to commercially merge the nations of the world into one global community. The United Nations is a major contributor to this agenda, as are a number of international organizations. The New World Order is not a fantasy; it is a developing reality! And Presidential administrations from both major parties have willingly collaborated with this draconian agenda. In fact, under Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, G.W. Bush, and now Barack Obama, globalization efforts have mushroomed exponentially.</p>
<p>The Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers, etc., are major players in the creation of a NWO, as is the military-industrial complex, the Federal Reserve, and international banks on both sides of the Atlantic. Another major component of the establishment of a New World Order is the burgeoning surveillance society and police state that both major parties in Washington, D.C., seem determined to implement.</p>
<p>Ron Paul is the ONLY Presidential candidate from either major party that truly understands the New World Order and is determined to resist it. He’s the only one! Mark it down, neither Romney, Santorum, nor Gingrich will lift a finger to resist the power elite inside the New World Order. They will do nothing to reverse the surveillance society taking shape in America. They will do nothing to resist the federal government’s obsessive control-freaks who are running many federal bureaucracies. Either none of them understands it, or if they do, they are absolutely unwilling to lift a finger to resist it.</p>
<p>I can only conclude that Ron Paul’s detractors haven’t a clue about the New World Order. They must not see it. They must not understand it. They must not be able to identify it. They must be totally ignorant about it, or else they would clearly appreciate Dr. Paul’s knowledge and acumen when he seeks to warn people about it and put himself on the firing line to oppose it. Even if one disagrees with Dr. Paul regarding particular societal issues, one must admire Ron Paul’s stand against the New World Order–especially since he is the only one opposing it! It is obvious to me that the only people who cannot appreciate Dr. Paul’s courageous commitment against the NWO are those who totally do not understand it.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying that everyone must agree with me and support Ron Paul for President. I know that good people can come to different conclusions in any political race. What I am saying is that it seems obvious to me that the vast majority of Dr. Paul’s vocal detractors seem to demonstrate misperceptions–or even downright ignorance–in at least one or more of the above realities.</p>
<p>Support him or not, vote for him or not, any honest American who understands constitutional government, who understands what a constitutional foreign policy should look like, and who understands and is concerned that America is in the throes of a burgeoning New World Order MUST at least appreciate and admire Congressman Ron Paul. And as for me, I SUPPORT, AND WILL VOTE FOR, RON PAUL!</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Nikola-Tesla-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Nikola-Tesla-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a><em>&#8216;Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe. Throughout space there is energy.</em>  &#8212; Nikola Tesla, 1892<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death.  Was he for real? A crackpot? Part of an early experiment in corporate-government control?</p>
<p>We know that he was undoubtedly persecuted by the energy power brokers of his day &#8212; namely Thomas Edison, whom we are taught in school to revere as a genius.  He was also attacked by J.P. Morgan and other &#8220;captains of industry.&#8221; Upon Tesla&#8217;s death on January 7th, 1943, the U.S. government moved into his lab and apartment confiscating all of his scientific research, and to this day none of this research has been made public.</p>
<p>Besides his persecution by corporate-government interests (which is practically a certification of authenticity), there is at least one solid indication of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s integrity &#8212; he tore up a contract with Westinghouse that was worth billions in order to save the company from paying him his huge royalty payments.</p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s take a look at what Nikola Tesla &#8212; a man who died broke and alone &#8212; has actually given to the world.  For better or worse, with credit or without, he changed the face of the planet in ways that perhaps no man ever has.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><strong>1. Alternating Current</strong> &#8211; This is where it all began, and what ultimately caused such a stir at the 1893 World&#8217;s Expo in Chicago.  A war was leveled ever-after between the vision of Edison and the vision of Tesla for how electricity would be produced and distributed.  The division can be summarized as one of cost and safety: The DC current that Edison (backed by General Electric) had been working on was costly over long distances, and produced dangerous sparking from the required converter (called a commutator).  Regardless, Edison and his backers utilized the general &#8220;dangers&#8221; of electric current to instill fear in Tesla&#8217;s alternative: Alternating Current.  As proof, Edison sometimes electrocuted animals at demonstrations.  Consequently, Edison gave the world the electric chair, while simultaneously maligning Tesla&#8217;s attempt to offer safety at a lower cost.  Tesla responded by demonstrating that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting current through his own body to produce light.  This Edison-Tesla (GE-Westinghouse) feud in 1893 was the culmination of over a decade of shady business deals, stolen ideas, and patent suppression that Edison and his moneyed interests wielded over Tesla&#8217;s inventions. Yet, despite it all, it is Tesla&#8217;s system that provides power generation and distribution to North America in our modern era.</p>
<p><strong>2. Light </strong>&#8211; Of course he didn&#8217;t invent light itself, but he did invent how light can be harnessed and distributed.  Tesla developed and used florescent bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry &#8220;invented&#8221; them. At the World&#8217;s Fair, Tesla took glass tubes and bent them into famous scientists&#8217; names, in effect creating the first neon signs.  However, it is his Tesla Coil that might be the most impressive, and controversial.  The Tesla Coil is certainly something that big industry would have liked to suppress: the concept that the Earth itself is a magnet that can generate electricity (electromagnetism) utilizing frequencies as a transmitter.  All that is needed on the other end is the receiver &#8212; much like a radio.</p>
<p><strong>3. X-rays &#8211; </strong>Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the late 1800s, but Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a precursor to <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/kirlian-photography-shows-organic.html">Kirlian photography</a>, which has the ability to document life force, to what we now use in medical diagnostics, this was a transformative invention of which Tesla <a href="http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/28/4/1189.full">played a central role</a>.  X-rays, like so many of Tesla&#8217;s contributions, stemmed from his belief that everything we need to understand the universe is virtually around us at all times, but we need to use our minds to develop real-world devices to augment our innate perception of existence.</p>
<p><strong>4. Radio</strong> &#8211; Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him to be the inventor of radio to this day.  However, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi&#8217;s patent in 1943, when it was proven that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi.  Radio signals are just another frequency that needs a transmitter and receiver, which Tesla also demonstrated in 1893 during a presentation before The National Electric Light Association.  In 1897 Tesla applied for two patents <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US645576" rel="nofollow"> US 645576</a>, and <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US649621" rel="nofollow">US 649621</a>. In 1904, however, The U.S. Patent Office reversed its decision, awarding Marconi a patent for the invention of radio, possibly influenced by Marconi&#8217;s financial backers in the States, who included Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie. This also allowed the U.S. government (among others) to avoid having to pay the royalties that were being claimed by Tesla.</p>
<p><strong>5. Remote Control</strong> &#8211; This invention was a natural outcropping of radio. Patent No.<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=0613809.PN.&amp;OS=PN/0613809&amp;RS=PN/0613809">613809</a> was the first remote controlled model boat, demonstrated in 1898.  Utilizing several large batteries; radio signals controlled switches, which then energized the boat&#8217;s propeller, rudder, and scaled-down running lights. While this exact technology was not widely used for some time, we now can see the power that was appropriated by the military in its pursuit of <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/6-technologies-for-de-humanizing-war.html">remote controlled war</a>. Radio controlled tanks were introduced by the Germans in WWII, and developments in this realm have since slid quickly away from the direction of human freedom.</p>
<p><strong>6. Electric Motor &#8211; </strong>Tesla&#8217;s invention of the electric motor has finally been popularized by <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">a car</a> brandishing his name.  While the technical specifications are beyond the scope of this summary, suffice to say that Tesla&#8217;s invention of a motor with rotating magnetic fields could have freed mankind much sooner from the stranglehold of Big Oil.  However, his invention in 1930 succumbed to the economic crisis and the world war that followed. Nevertheless, this invention has fundamentally changed the landscape of what we now take for granted: industrial fans, household applicances, water pumps, machine tools, power tools, disk drives, electric wristwatches and compressors.</p>
<p><strong>7. Robotics</strong> &#8211; Tesla&#8217;s overly enhanced scientific mind led him to the idea that all living beings are merely driven by external impulses.  He stated: &#8220;I have by every thought and act of mine, demonstrated, and does so daily, to my absolute satisfaction that I am an automaton endowed with power of movement, which merely responds to external stimuli.&#8221;  Thus, the concept of the robot was born.  However, an element of the human remained present, as Tesla asserted that these human replicas should have limitations &#8212; namely growth and propagation. Nevertheless, Tesla unabashedly embraced all of what intelligence could produce.  His visions for a future filled with intelligent cars, robotic human companions, and the use of sensors, and autonomous systems are detailed in a must-read entry in the <a href="http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=1451-48690603163V">Serbian Journal of Electrical Engineering, 2006 (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8. Laser</strong> &#8211; Tesla&#8217;s invention of the laser may be one of the best examples of the good and evil bound up together within the mind of man.  Lasers have transformed surgical applications in an undeniably beneficial way, and they have given rise to much of our current digital media. However, with this leap in innovation we have also crossed into the land of science fiction.  From Reagan&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; laser defense system to today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/12/orwellian-non-lethal-war-waged-against.html">Orwellian &#8220;non-lethal&#8221; weapons&#8217;</a> arsenal, which includes laser rifles and directed energy &#8220;death rays,&#8221; there is great potential for development in both directions.</p>
<p><strong>9 and 10. Wireless Communications and Limitless Free Energy</strong> &#8211; These two are inextricably linked, as they were the last straw for the power elite &#8212; what good is energy if it can&#8217;t be metered and controlled?  Free?  Never.  J.P. Morgan backed Tesla with $150,000 to build a tower that would use the natural frequencies of our universe to transmit data, including a wide range of information communicated through images, voice messages, and text.  This represented the world&#8217;s first wireless communications, but it also meant that aside from the cost of the tower itself, the universe was filled with free energy that could be utilized to form a world wide web connecting all people in all places, as well as allow people to harness the free energy around them.  Essentially, the 0&#8242;s and 1&#8242;s of the universe are embedded in the fabric of existence for each of us to access as needed.  Nikola Tesla was dedicated to empowering the individual to receive and transmit this data virtually free of charge.  But we know the ending to that story . . . until now?</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" alt="" align="left" />Tesla had perhaps thousands of other ideas and inventions that remain unreleased.  A look at his <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yvwev4">hundreds of patents</a> shows a glimpse of the scope he intended to offer.  If you feel that the additional technical and scientific research of Nikola Tesla should be revealed for public scrutiny and discussion, instead of suppressed by big industry and even our supposed <a href="http://poorrichards-blog.blogspot.com/2011/12/history-of-mits-blatant-suppression-of.html">institutions of higher education</a>, please <strong><a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/%21/petition/release-nikola-teslas-technical-and-scientific-research/S9CjXwh5">sign this petition</a></strong> to demand that power brokers everywhere learn that we are ready to Occupy Energy and learn about what our universe really has to offer.</p>
<p>The release of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s technical and scientific research &#8212; specifically his research into harnessing electricity from the ionosphere at a facility called Wardenclyffe &#8212; is a necessary step toward true freedom of information.  The petition has a goal of 25,000 signatures and needs your support, but whether or not it is reached please continue to add your voice by sharing this information with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>A Facebook event page for the official call on January 7th, the anniversary of Tesla&#8217;s death, can be found here:  <a title="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332" dir="ltr" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332</a></p>
<p>For additional information about the demand for release, please visit:<a title="http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/" dir="ltr" href="http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/</a></p>
<p>As they state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tell your friends, bring it up and discuss it at your next general assembly, do whatever you can to get the word out, organize locally to make a stand for the release of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s research&#8230;. America is tired of corrupt corporate greed, supported by The American government, holding us back in a stagnant society in the name of profit . . . The Energy Crisis is a lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an aside: there are some who have pointed out that Tesla&#8217;s experimentation with the ionosphere very well could have caused the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~onichelson/ONichelsonTUNGUSKA.pdf">massive explosion over Tunguska, Siberia in 1908,</a> which leveled an estimated 60 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers, and may even have led to the much maligned <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/08/weather-wars-and-devils-haarp.html">HAARP</a> technology.  I submit that we would do well to remember that technology is never the true enemy; it is the <em>misuse</em> of technology that can enslave rather than free mankind from its animal-level survivalism.</p>
<p>Please view the video below, which does an excellent job at personalizing this largely forgotten human being, as well as show the reasons why to this day he is not a household name.</p>

<p>And here is a video that offers an essential alternative view of ancient Egypt and other cultures that employed pyramidal structures, which suggests the staggering outer limits of what Tesla was attempting to harness and offer to humanity:</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/carrier-aircraft-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/carrier-aircraft-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>2011 will be remembered as the year the US, Britain, France and Israel went into Imperial Overdrive in North Africa and the Middle East. Will 2012 be remembered as the year those same Western Allies unleashed World War III?</p>
<p>It is not news anymore to say that the West will soon attack Iran, maybe Syria. They have been threatening to do that for years now, certainly ever since the failed Israeli invasion into Southern Lebanon in mid-2006, when they were routed by Hezbollah.</p>
<p>So what is different today? For starters, general circumstances have changed dramatically in the Region. Genuine popular dissent inside key Muslim countries has been used by the Western Allies to train, fund and arm local criminal and terrorist organizations, dubbed “freedom fighters”, as their proxies.</p>
<p>Country after country has fallen victim to the CIA’s, MI6’s and Mossad’s “dirty tricks departments”, and other Western-style terrorist organizations. Results range from moderate “regime change” in Tunisia and Algeria; via horrendous “violence by our boys” in Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain; all the way to outright military attack, civil war and political assassination. Such as the one in Libya, where Hillary Clinton boisterously laughed when she learned Muammar Gaddafi had been murdered live on TV by “her thugs”.</p>
<p>The whole region has been set on fire. Not that other regions of the world are not on fire too; however the pyrotechnics used by the Global Power Elite vary in nature in each geography. For example, Europe, the US and Britain are being set alight using financial terrorism resembling a neutron bomb, which kills people off while leaving assets and banks standing.</p>
<p>Now in Iran the stage seems set for a final show-down. It has taken so long only because Israeli, British and US planners are not stupid; they know that messing with Iran is not like messing with Iraq or Pakistan or Afghanistan or Libya. Messing with Iran will bring Western Allies very dangerously close to messing with Russia and China. If I were in their shoes, I would not do that. Unless…</p>
<p>Unless World War III is what they are looking for. Now, why would they do that?  Perhaps, because they have realized that there is just no peaceful way of achieving their dream of World Government. Perhaps because they have understood that the financial quicksand they have backed themselves into is so devastating that it cannot be cleaned up with purely financial, monetary and “legal” measures, in which case…</p>
<p>Nothing beats a good war! Perhaps, because wildcard Israel is so very much in control (or should I say, out of control) that they are imposing the “Sampson Option” not only on themselves, but also on their controlled Western Allies and the whole planet if need be.<em> “After me, the Flood!”</em></p>
<p>Things in the Strait of Hormuz are extremely dangerous and volatile. After being systematically threatened with unilateral military attack, invasion, and even nuclear strikes, now the Iranians are showing their muscle too. On 24th December, Iran began a 10-day spate of military maneuvers in the strait that has all but put the US, UK and Israel on red alert. A US aircraft carrier force is now in the area and their helicopters have flown dangerously close to Iranian forces. Any spark could set off a conflagration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Syria is falling into meltdown. Meanwhile, Israel is preparing “Cast Lead II” over and inside Gaza. Meanwhile, Hezbollah is ready to strike Israel with tens of thousands of very deadly short-range “Katyushka” rockets.</p>
<p>A key sign of impending war is an article just published in the January/February 2012 issue of Foreign Affairs, the official journal of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). It carried the ominous title of Time to Attack Iran: Why a Strike Is the Least Bad Option, by Matthew Kroenig. This man was, until last July, special advisor to the Pentagon for “Defense Strategy on Iran” – Newspeak for<em> “let’s beat the hell out of Iran”.</em></p>
<p>The CFR is the key Global Power Elite think-tank, founded in 1919 together with its London sister organization, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (also known as Chatham House). Its more than 4500 members are deeply embedded into the uppermost echelons of public and private power in the US, controlling banking, industry, media, academia, the military and government.</p>
<p>Key government posts are always controlled by one of their lot, irrespective of whether the Democrats or Republicans are in power. The CFR is integrated into an intricate network of similar organizations that includes the Trilateral Commission, Brookings Institution, American Enterprise Group, Project for a New American Century, Bilderberg and others. They all operate in streamlined coordination, consistency, synchronization and – most important – with a common purpose.</p>
<p>In his article, Mr Kroenig, assesses how<em> “American pundits and policymakers have been debating whether the United States should attack Iran and attempt to eliminate its nuclear facilities,” </em>concluding that,<em> “The only thing worse than military action against Iran would be an Iran armed with nuclear weapons.”</em></p>
<p>He warns against <em>“skeptics of military action (who) fail to appreciate the true danger that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to US interests in the Middle East and beyond.”  </em></p>
<p>This reflects Defense Secretary Leon Panetta’s recent remarks when addressing the Brookings Institution’s pro-Israel “Saban Forum” bringing together US and Israeli military strategists that repeated the usual Baby Bush “all options are on the table” threats.</p>
<p>Mr. Kroenig talks of the <em>“dangers of deterrence” </em>and gives the Obama Administration unequivocal advice: <em>“The truth is that a military strike intended to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, if managed carefully, could spare the region and the world a very real threat and dramatically improve the long-term national security of the United States.”</em></p>
<p>As these pyromaniacs get ready to ignite the regional and global powder keg, one key question looms ever larger: what will Russia do?</p>

<em>What happens if <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Ron Paul</a> wins Iowa? &#8230; Paul seems to have a natural ceiling among GOP voters: A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found that nearly half of Republican voters feel Paul&#8217;s foreign policy views are a major reason not to vote for him. Indeed, the primary reason Paul has an opening to win in Iowa is that no consensus candidate has emerged among social <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">conservatives</a>, which dominate the GOP electorate here </em><em>–</em><em> a situation that allows Paul to potentially win with less than 30 percent of the vote. Still, a Paul win in Iowa would have significant ramifications. It would go a long way toward pushing his <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Libertarian</a> views, long dismissed as outside of Republican mainstream, to the center of the conversation. The resultant media coverage would allow Paul to further spread his message</em><em> – </em><em>and potentially win a host of new supporters. And if Paul can do well in New Hampshire on January 10, where he is currently tied for second place with Gingrich, Paul could even move to shared front-runner status with Romney, who is now ahead by more than 20 points in New Hampshire. – CBSNews</em></p>
<p><strong>Dominant Social Theme:</strong> Paul is a crank and will never light up the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Free-Market Analysis: </strong>The <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Internet Reformation</a> is a process not an episode. US GOP Presidential candidate Ron Paul shows us the accuracy of this statement. Ron Paul and his libertarian allies are winning the battle for the hearts and minds of Americans by the millions. In fact, they have already won. More on this below.</p>
<p>It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that a substantial minority, if not a majority, of Republicans and Democrats are really libertarians of some sort. This gives Ron Paul a natural constituency that is far larger than the<a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">mainstream media</a> admits.</p>
<p>There is apparently only one struggle in the world – and in the US. That is the seeming struggle between a handful of ancient, elite families who control hundreds of trillions via <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">central banks</a> around the world and want to move to world government (dominated by them) and the rest of us.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Anglosphere</a> <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">power elite</a> has used its unimaginable money base to seemingly pervert the workings of the entire world. It apparently uses <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">dominant social themes</a> – fear-based promotions disseminated by its bought-and-paid-for media, think tanks, universities and governments – to frighten middle classes into giving up wealth and power to cleverly crafted globalist institutions. This is the internationalist government-in-waiting.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happened on the way to world government. The Internet. About a decade ago, we began to focus on the idea that the Internet was a modern-day <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Gutenberg Press</a> and would have a similar impact.</p>
<p>The Gutenberg Press basically spawned the <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Renaissance</a>, Reformation and contributed to counter-Reformation trends such as the Age of Enlightenment that was spawned by the elites themselves in an effort to counteract the power of the Gutenberg Press. The Age of Enlightenment postulated that man was perfectible and the agency of perfection was government.</p>
<p>Government is an absolute necessity for power elites. With the advent of the Gutenberg Press, however, something changed. The great families of Europe found it advisable to promote the fallacious idea of &#8220;<a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">democracy</a>.&#8221; This idea, that people would &#8220;have a say&#8221; in their governments, allowed the power elite then and now to withdraw from the public scene and dominate from behind the scenes. This domination is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">mercantilism</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as it is imperative these days for the power elite not to reveal itself, so it is imperative that the elites continue to have access to all levels of government in order to pass the laws necessary to its survival. Without the faux-system of civil society that the elites have erected in the past 150 years, there would be no prospect of a <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">one-world order</a>.</p>
<p>No one wakes up in the morning and decides to spend one&#8217;s life building global government. It is an entirely false paradigm that this happens. People are coerced into believing that global government is inevitable and that their <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">self-interest</a> is better fulfilled by working with the powers-that-be than against them. This sense of INEVITABILITY is part of what drives the push toward the New World Order.</p>
<p>But it has long been our contention that those who predict the inevitability of the coming one-world order may not be entirely correct. It continues to be our contention – as we follow modern events – that the elites seeking global governance have been considerably set back by the Internet, as we have long predicted.</p>
<p>We know this to be true by the amount of violence the elite central banking families are turning to. Violence, insane legislative initiatives like SOPA, the erection of prison camps and the fomentation of wars around the world are all signs of the fear that has overtaken these elites. They do not want to be found out.</p>
<p>One needs only to study a little history to begin to understand the relevance of the paradigm we are suggesting. After the Gutenberg Press began to expose the power elite of the day and its manipulations, the first copyright laws were passed, the &#8220;isms&#8221; were suddenly developed, the <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Hegelian Dialectic</a> was brought into play significantly and wars broke out throughout the West and lasted for decades.</p>
<p>There IS likely a playbook. There are surely manipulations that the elites pursue over and over in their loony quest for world government. One sees them put into play after the advent of the Gutenberg Press just as they are being put into play today. This is not an easy idea to accept, however, even for the alternative Internet Press. It is much easier and more psychologically satisfying to speak of ancient cabals, such as <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Jewish</a>/Zionist penetration via vast <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Illuminati</a>-Masonic plots.</p>
<p>But the truth TODAY is simpler than that, in our view. The world is being run by an intergenerational mafia of familial elites that USE <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">religion</a> and symbolism to affright people and impress on everyone the inevitability of what it is to come.</p>
<p>This is the reason, for instance, that <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Muammar Gaddafi</a>&#8216;s execution was shown over and over for weeks. This was the reason his purported buggery was made available throughout the world though ordinarily the Western mainstream media is averse even to showing so much as a kiss to a general audience that includes children.</p>
<p>Gaddafi&#8217;s death was a warning. Just as the wars in Africa and the Middle East are cautionary ones. They have little or nothing to do with oil or the &#8220;great game&#8221; or other resources. When the Pentagon wanted to make a case for staying in Afghanistan it suddenly discovered a trillion-dollars&#8217;-worth of rare-earth minerals and other commodities. It is all so transparent.</p>
<p>The powers-that-be seek control. The stiff-necked <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Pashtuns</a> and tricky Punjabis that are now 300 million strong and have dominated the navel of the earth for millennia must be conquered and pacified. This is the struggle taking place today.</p>
<p>And yet, we have predicted the Anglosphere may already have lost this war for global domination. The hidden influence of Money Power in our view peaked in the 20th century. The 21st century has offered them one disaster after another.</p>
<p>9/11 itself is still a questionable event. Attempts to impose the phony <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">meme</a> of <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">global warming</a> are also not going well. The <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">war on terror</a> is increasingly met by disbelief. Scarcity memes of all types have less power to upset, and are increasingly exposed on the Internet.</p>
<p>And then there is Ron Paul. Four years ago, libertarian politician Ron Paul was regarded by the mainstream media as a harmless, crazy crank. Today, according to a CBS article (see excerpt above), the only thing standing between Ron Paul and a sociopolitical consensus around his libertarian points of view is the view by many that he will &#8220;undermine&#8221; national security. Or so we are told.</p>
<p>But this meme, too, shall have its day – and be gone. That&#8217;s because the Internet is a process not an episode. The damage control that the elites practices in the 20th century doesn&#8217;t work anymore. They have turned to a more ancient playbook, in our view, but history shows THAT is not so effective, either.</p>
<p>People naturally lose perspective. But back in the 1990s a trio helped change the world. Dr. Ron Paul and economist<a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Murray Rothbard</a> were close friends. <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Lew Rockwell</a> was the organizer and raised the money. Rothbard wrote prodigiously and Ron Paul kept delivering babies and running for office. Ron Paul is the most famous and successful libertarian politician of the past 100 years.</p>
<p>This trio built on what is good in what we today call civil society and eventually, as the Internet era began, were joined by popularizers like Matt Drudge, <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Alex Jones</a> &#8230; and then more. And so once again the ideas of freedom and individual HUMAN action (versus <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Adam Smith</a>&#8216;s Wealth of NATIONS) were propagated as they had been before. No one is perfect, but this aspiration is larger than personal agendas, and grounded in the logic of civil society built up over centuries by the greatest and most courageous of minds.</p>
<p>This is the story of civilization, in fact. It is a language and a conversation. It reoccurs. It cannot be extinguished because it may blaze anew in the hearts of the next generation. Sure, it may take a village, but it is one made up of INDIVIDUALS. And everyone is welcome. All who subscribe to the individual greatness of the human species are conveyances for what is worth carrying forward in human society. God damn those who do not.</p>
<p>History seems to us a series of cycles, struggles between historical elites and the rest. Such a struggle has been joined today. This is REAL history. We are lucky enough to live at a time when the old order is passing. Maybe what we are seeing is its death struggles.</p>
<p>The Internet is making it impossible for it to thrive in its current form. Central banks printing monopoly money-from-nothing, wars of aggression, the incarceration of millions &#8230; these are indefensible paradigms when one does not fully control the media anymore.</p>
<p>The Internet Reformation is like a wildfire, perhaps. It seems to be burning away the manifestations of the American Empire by incinerating the disingenuous moral buttresses that hold together this phony construct of the modern power elite. By the time the Internet Reformation has run its course, today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">authoritarian</a> verities may have perished entirely. (They will of course emerge in another form.)</p>
<p>Right now, according to this CBS article, only the lie that the <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">military-industrial complex</a> &#8220;keeps America safe&#8221; stands between the fullness of Leviathan and its subsidence. But what happens, as will be inevitable, when Americans in larger numbers find out that this &#8220;safety&#8221; is non-existent?</p>
<p>What happens when Americans finally realize that the string of wars that have &#8220;defended&#8221; them were perhaps phony? What happens when the seeming manipulations that caused the phony Cold War fully penetrate popular consciousness? What happens when the truth about 9/11 – whatever it is – is finally revealed?</p>
<p>The last memes of the power elite that will tumble (as we have long predicted) are the fundaments of the state itself: the insanity of the current model of state justice (where the state itself and its controllers make the laws and then pay for the legislatures, courts and military and civilian police and penitentiary guards that enforce this phony &#8220;justice.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The corollary is the military-industrial complex itself and its myriad millions of intel operatives in London, <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">Washington, DC</a> and Tel Aviv. These individuals are already worried; their privacy invasions, incarcerations and tortures weigh heavily on them. It is occurring to them that they may be on the wrong side of history – real history.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">George W. Bush</a> is afraid to travel outside of the United States. <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/3417/Ron-Paul-Has-Already-Won">David Rockefeller</a> is approaching the century mark and is not his old persuasive self. The Rothschilds are regularly making appearances on business television to show they are merely struggling businessmen and bankers. The US Congress attempts to pass evermore Draconian laws to stop the Internet Reformation. Wars are fomented to take over the world. And yet the navel of the world remains unconquered.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The Internet, which was never supposed to happen, continues to inform people every day about the despicable nature of the elite&#8217;s 20th century directed history. The old paradigms are crumbling. A thousand, ten thousand, a million prison camps may not capture the truths echoing around the world. The Internet is a process not an episode.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/clocks-reuters3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/clocks-reuters2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The Private Global Power Elite embedded in major governments is dead set on imposing World Government on us sooner rather than later. Let’s look at 12 mega-processes – veritable “Triggers” – that we infer they are using to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>All roads lead to World Government.  This should come as no surprise.  London’s Financial Times openly articulated this view in an article by their chief foreign affairs commentator, Gideon Rachman, published on 8 December 2009, whose title said it all: “And Now for a World Government.” These goals are echoed by the Trilateral Commission, CFR and Bilderberg insiders – even by the Vatican.</p>
<p>Macro-managing planet Earth is no easy matter. It requires strategic and tactical planning by a vast think-tank network allied to major elite universities whereby armies of academics, operators, lobbyists, media players and government officers interface, all abundantly financed by the global corporate and banking superstructure.</p>
<p>They do this holistically, knowing that they operate on different stages moving at very different speeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Triggers move at lightning speed thanks to electronic information technology that can make or break markets, currencies and entire countries in just hours or days;</li>
<li>Economic Triggers move slower: manufacturing cars, aircraft, food, clothes, building plants and houses takes months;</li>
<li>Political Triggers tied to the “democratic system” put politicians in power for several years;</li>
<li>Cultural Triggers require entire generations to implement; this is where PsyWar has reached unprecedented “heights”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Risk-managing this whole process takes into account the many pitfalls and surprises in store.  So each plan in every field counts, with “Plan B’s” – even Plans “C” and “D” – which can be implemented if needed.</p>
<h3>Twelve Triggers for World Government</h3>
<p>Today, the Global Power Elite are wrapping up globalization and ushering in World Government.  Paraphrasing the tightrope walker in German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” this implies “….a dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting…&#8221;</p>
<p>These 12 Triggers are interlinked and interlocked in a highly complex, holistic matrix, very flexible in its tactics but rigidly unbending in its strategic objectives. When read as a whole, the picture that unfolds shows that whole being far more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>1) Financial Meltdown. Since 2008, the Global Financial System continues on life-support. Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner and the US economic hit team – Robert Rubin, Larry Summers and Goldman Sachs, CitiGroup, JPMorganChase mega-bankers working with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank – have not and will not take any measures to help the populace and ailing economies.  They just funnel trillions to the banking elite, imposing the media myth that certain banks are “too big to fail” (Orwellian Newspeak for “too damn powerful to fail”). Why? Because it’s not governments overseeing, supervising and controlling Goldman Sachs, CitiCorp, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, JPMorganChase, but exactly the other way around…</p>
<p>2) Economic Crises.  Today, “Destructive Extreme Capitalism” is collapsing national and regional economies, reformatting them into international slave-labour Gulag-like entities that Joseph Stalin would envy.   Our woes lie not with the world’s real economy (mostly intact), but with the fake world of finance, banks, and speculation;</p>
<p>3) Social Upheavals.  Meltdowns in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Iceland and – soon to come – Italy, Spain and others, trigger violent social uprisings, even in the US and UK;</p>
<p>4) Pandemics.  Get ready for more “flu surprises” leading to mandatory vaccinations: a discreet opportunity to slip RFID chips into our bodies and test “intelligent viruses” targeting specific DNA strains.  Racially and ethnically selective viruses as part of mass depopulation campaigns?</p>
<p>5) Global Warming. As the global economy sinks into zero growth mode, economic drivers shift from growth expansion to consumption contraction. Will coming “carbon credits” open the path to full societal control?</p>
<p>6) Terrorist “False Flag” Mega-Attacks. The Elite have this wildcard up their sleeve to jump-start new “crises” as short-cuts towards world government.  Will new “attacks” dwarfing 9/11 justify further global wars, invasions and genocide?  A nuclear weapon over a major city to be blamed on the Elite’s “enemies”?</p>
<p>7) Generalized War in the Middle East. As we speak, naval forces, bombers, entire armies are poised to attack and invade Syria, Iran…</p>
<p>8 ) Ecological/Environmental “Accidents”. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident sparked the beginning of the end of the former USSR by showing the world and the Soviets themselves that their State could no longer manage their own nuclear facilities.  April 2010 saw the BP “Deepwater Horizon” oil rig eco-catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico; since March 2011, Japan and the world have been grappling with a much larger nuclear accident in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex.  Was foul play involved?</p>
<p>9) Assassination of a major political or religious figure to be blamed on an Elite enemy.  Mossad, CIA, MI6 are really good at playing this type of dirty trick;</p>
<p>10) Attacks on “Rogue States” – Iraq, Libya… Who’s next? Iran? Syria?  Venezuela?  North Korea?</p>
<p>11) Staged “Religious” Event. The growing need of the masses for meaning in their lives makes them easy victims of a Hollywood-staged, 3D virtual reality hologram show, orchestrating a “second coming”.  An electronically engineered “messianic figure” acting in sync with Elite global objectives?   Who would dare go against God himself?</p>
<p>12) Staged “Alien Contact.” This too may be in the works.  For decades, large sectors of world population have been programmed to believe in aliens.  Here too, hologram technology could stage a “space vehicle landing” – on the White House lawn, of course – highlighting the “need” for Mankind to have “unified representation” in the face of extraterrestrials.  Further justification for world government?<br />
What do such interlocking “crises” have in common? Global warming, pandemics, “international terrorism”, financial collapse, economic depression, even alien contacts?  They all serve to show that they cannot be addressed by any single nation state, thus “justifying” the need for World Government.<br />
2012: We must stay especially alert, understanding things the way they really are and not the way the global TV Masters want us to believe they are.</p>

<p>So much written about the Occupy Wall Street is pure BS. If this street theater was a spontaneous and independent movement, where is the outrage towards the high priest of monetary manipulation, George Soros?</p>
<p>From the outset, civil disobedience is the most sincere method of dissent. <a href="http://batr.net/">Breaking All the Rules</a> is based upon a healthy and judicious resistance towards all levels of false authority and systemic corruption. Therefore, it is with a heavy heart, that the careerist organizers and front groups for the establishment sweep away the noble intentions of earnest radicals. Those enablers and facilitators of fraudulent financial institutions makes a mockery of authentic protection.</p>
<p>Long ago, the glory of tangible free enterprise was destroyed under the boot of State Capitalism. When the confused populace rails against demonstrations and defend the crooks that perverted economic <a href="http://batr.org/markets/">M A R K E T S</a>, it becomes clear why the public has a habit of losing money with brokerage houses. In order to take the going broke out of the &#8220;so called&#8221; investments, one had better learn early that paper assets, often come with future liabilities, when entrusted to the establishment.Occupy Wall Street is smeared as extreme by those who benefit from a diversion away from their own wrongdoings. Once upon a time, a stock exchange functioned as a clearinghouse medium for raising capital. The investment funds financed new ventures that would produce useful products and employ labor. This bygone era was the engine of creating true wealth. Today, gambling is the primary activity conducted under a rigged casino wheel.</p>
<p>How much history do you recall? The incompatible Antony C. Sutton documents in <a href="http://www.reformed-theology.org/html/books/bolshevik_revolution/index.html">Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution</a> how the monopolists of finance funded Lenin. George Soros plays the Schiff role in this modern day version of a Goldman Sachs impersonation of Kuhn, Loeb and Company. If you do not know this pesky fact of the last century, one cannot be expected to make sense out of current events.A simple comparison between OWS and TE (The Establishment) is in order.</p>

During the Old Regime under the reign of Louis XVI, the aristocracy lost their heads under the guillotine. In the 21th Century, the masters of the universe, spread breadcrumbs by way of food stamps to a society relegated to systemic government poverty and dependency. The only cake consumed these days requires a hedge fund account to pay for the icing and toppings.</p>

<p>What realistic likelihood is there for a people’s revolution to replace the titans of finance, when the robber barons are playing CHOPIN : <a href="http://youtu.be/L8aF3MmSDDQ">Marche Funèbre</a> for the occupied nation? What chance is there for a replay of the French Libertine Tradition to play out when the theme of anti-clericalism, anti-establishment and eroticism have had their run and the establishment just gets more bold and powerful?A novel counter approach to guns and pitchforks is the video camera that documents the police state. Deplorably the ordinary exploited bystander is characterized as an extremist and soon will be incarcerated into internment camps, built by the <em>Uber Elite</em>. What many naive observers see is not the brutality of the Gestapo police, but the disrespect of the unclean protestors of the Capitalist kingdom.</p>
<p>Most Americans refuse to face the facts of their enslavement and rather condemn the social rebel. Bringing true social justice to an economic system that has eliminated all vestiges of real Free Market enterprise is viewed as a betrayal.</p>
<p>When that hideous dinosaur of establishment journalism, Time Magazine, wraps the symbolism of the protestor in the garb of a terrorist, the message is clear for even the most brain dead striver for more government largess.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine" target="_self"><span style="color: #000000;"><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/POY_Final_.jpg.w180h240.jpg" alt="POY_Final_.jpg" width="180" align="Right" border="" hspace="5" vspace="0" /></span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2101745_2102132,00.html">Time</a> distorts the significance with more deflection and confusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Massive and effective street protest&#8221; was a global oxymoron until — suddenly, shockingly — starting exactly a year ago, it became the defining trope of our times. And the protester once again became a maker of history.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/time-person-of-the-year-2011-the-protester/2011/12/14/gIQAvZtntO_blog.html">Washington Post</a> adds to the illusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In this year’s report, Time pieced together what all these revolutions have in common, why they protest, and what the legacy of the year’s protests will be. The magazine profiles a citizen journalist who started the live stream for Occupy Wall Street from Zuccotti Park.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What both Time and the Washington Post want you to accept is that these protests are composed of radical inspiration and democratic design. No doubt, many demonstrators believe they are acting out of pure intentions, but most are so deluded by inept viewpoints, absent of any consistent or comprehensive philosophy, that they are clueless about goals, objectives and have no viable substitute economic system.</p>
<p>Wall Street only uses money accumulation for keeping score. The underlying objective of the power elite is to control the political process and write all the rules. Nothing has changed from the days of installing Marxist ideology in Russia to the present stage of completing the task of instituting <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/index.html">totalitarian collectivism</a> in our country. Another establishment media purveyor of disinformation is <a href="http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/12/15/9471810-rev-jesse-jackson-to-london-protesters-jesus-was-an-occupier">MSNBC</a>. In an article by the perennial social outlaw and opportunist, Jesse Jackson compares the global anti-capitalist movement to the U.S. civil rights struggle, the battle against apartheid in South Africa and the fight for Indian independence.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jesus was an Occupier, born under a death warrant, a Jew by religion, born in poverty under Roman occupation,&#8221; the two-time candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination told a crowd near Saint Paul’s Cathedral. &#8220;Gandhi was an Occupier, Martin Luther King was an Occupier, (Nelson) Mandela was an Occupier.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Coming from an extortionist posing as a minister of faith, this charlatan plays a bit role in the overall scheme to destroy the legitimate foundations of raising capital for worthwhile business endeavors. He insults the significance of Jesus’ ministry and Gandhi’s example. His role is to lead more people into even greater mental confusion.</p>
<p>The establishment refines the elements of mass propaganda and psychological indoctrination to create image campaigns that the system is a moderate and stable force, and must be maintained. As with most left or progressive oriented mindsets, the articulation of social wrongs and injustices are often well stated. However, when it comes to providing meaningful alternatives, the peasants just demand a larger sliced of bread because they are unable to learn the skills to bake their own cake.</p>
<p>Until society embraces the insight that the establishment is behind most radical social movements, they will just keep falling into a dark coffin, designed for them by the very elites that they protect. Economic conditions and business endeavors are on the mind of everyone, especially those who are on the edge of survival. OWS will never provide moneymaking guidance for the average citizen. Even so, do not condemn all forms of protest. Actually genuine resistance accompanied with practical time proven principles of monetary and business wealth creation is the desired option.</p>
<p>In order to explore the nature of financial alternatives and present rational choices for a replacement of the corporatist system of monetary tyranny and transnational globalism, BATR will be starting the <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/">Negotium</a> series of weekly business columns.Blending functional economics with political realism is the mission of this endeavor. The overriding principle to achieve a prosperous society requires building upon a solid foundation of Western Civilization and traditional heritage. Understanding the extent that the establishment is willing to go and the degree of deceit that bonds the various corrupt institutions is an essential goal for this collection of essays.</p>
<p>Appreciating the need for extreme encounters with the moderate establishment is a concept that some will challenge. However, given the current state of economic ruin, the plights of the former middle class will only deteriorate at a faster pace under the rule of the Wall Street banksters.</p>
<p>There is an alternative, and you are invited to join the spontaneous rebellion of the real America. Someday the OWS proponents may mature and gain the wisdom to know who is benefiting from their manufactured and controlled protests. Until that time, the task resides with you. Register your opposition to the Wall Street enslavers who stage-manage righteous outrage as an opportunity to misdirect legitimate rebellion. Time is short, act soon.</p>
