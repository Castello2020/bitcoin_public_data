<p><strong>Why hasn’t Washington joined Russian President Putin in calling for an objective, non-politicized international investigation by experts of the case of the Malaysian jetliner?</strong></p>
<p>The Russian government continues to release facts, including satellite photos showing the presence of Ukrainian Buk anti-aircraft missiles in locations from which the airliner could have been brought down by the missile system and documentation that a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet rapidly approached the Malaysian airliner prior to its downing. The head of the Operations Directorate of Russian military headquarters said at a Moscow press conference today (July 21) that the presence of the Ukrainian military jet is confirmed by the Rostov monitoring center.</p>
<p>The Russian Defense Ministry pointed out that, at the moment of destruction of MH-17, an American satellite was flying over the area. The Russian government urges Washington to make available the photos and data captured by the satellite.</p>
<p>President Putin has repeatedly stressed that the investigation of MH-17 requires “a fully representative group of experts to be working at the site under the guidance of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).” Putin’s call for an independent expert examination by ICAO does not sound like a person with anything to hide.</p>
<p>Turning to Washington, Putin stated, “In the meantime, no one [not even the “exceptional nation”] has the right to use this tragedy to achieve their narrowly selfish political goals.”</p>
<p>Putin reminded Washington, “We repeatedly called upon all conflicting sides to stop the bloodshed immediately and to sit down at the negotiating table. I can say with confidence that if military operations were not resumed [by Kiev] on June 28 in eastern Ukraine, this tragedy wouldn’t have happened.”</p>
<p>What is the American response?</p>
<p>Lies and insinuations.</p>
<p>Yesterday (July 20) US Secretary of State John Kerry said that pro-Russian separatists were involved in the downing of the Malaysian airliner and said that it was “pretty clear” that Russia was involved. Here are Kerry’s words: “It’s pretty clear that this is a system that was transferred from Russia into the hands of separatists. We know with confidence, with confidence, that the Ukrainians did not have such a system anywhere near the vicinity at that point and time, so it obviously points a very clear finger at the separatists.”</p>
<p>Kerry’s statement is just another of the endless lies told by US secretaries of state in the 21st century. Who can forget Colin Powell’s package of lies delivered to the UN about Saddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction” or Kerry’s lie repeated endlessly that Assad “used chemical weapons against his own people” or the endless lies about “Iranian nukes”?</p>
<p>Remember that Kerry, on a number of occasions, stated that the US had proof that Assad crossed the “red line” by using chemical weapons. However, Kerry was never able to back up his statements with evidence. The US had no evidence to give the British prime minister, whose effort to have parliament approve Britain’s participation with Washington in a military attack on Syria was voted down. Parliament told the prime minister, “no evidence, no war.”</p>
<p>Again, here is Kerry declaring “confidence” in statements that are directly contradicted by the Russian satellite photos and endless eye witnesses on the ground.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t Washington release its photos from its satellite?</p>
<p>The answer is for the same reason that Washington will not release all the videos it confiscated and that it claims prove that a hijacked 9/11 airliner hit the Pentagon. The videos do not support Washington’s claim, and the US satellite photos do not support Kerry’s claim.</p>
<p>The UN weapons inspectors on the ground in Iraq reported that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. However, the fact did not support Washington’s propaganda and was ignored. Washington started a highly destructive war based on nothing but Washington’s intentional lie.</p>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspectors on the ground in Iran and all 16 US intelligence agencies reported that Iran had no nuclear weapons program. However, the fact was inconsistent with Washington’s agenda and was ignored by both the US government and the presstitute media.</p>
<p>We are witnessing the same thing right now with the assertions in the absence of evidence that Russia is responsible for the downing of the Malaysian airliner.</p>
<p>Not every member of the US government is as reckless as Kerry and John McCain. In place of direct lies, many US officials use insinuations.</p>
<p>US Senator Diane Feinstein is the perfect example. Interviewed on the presstitute TV station CNN, Feinstein said, “The issue is where is Putin? I would say, ‘Putin, you have to man up. You should talk to the world. You should say, if this is a mistake, which I hope it was, say it.’”</p>
<p>Putin has been talking to the world nonstop calling for an expert non-politicized investigation, and Feinstein is asking Putin why he is hiding behind silence. We know you did it, Feinstein insinuates, so just tell us whether you meant to or whether it was an accident.</p>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #5b5b5b;"><p>The way the entire Western news cycle was orchestrated with blame instantly being placed on Russia long in advance of real information suggests that the downing of the airliner was a Washington operation. It is, of course, possible that the well-trained presstitute media needed no orchestration from Washington in order to lay the blame on Russia. On the other hand, some of the news performances seem too scripted not to have been prepared in advance.</p></blockquote>
<p>We also have the advanced preparation of the youtube video that purports to show a Russian general and Ukrainian separatists discussing having mistakenly downed a civilian airliner. As I pointed out earlier, this video is twice damned. It was ready in advance and by implicating the Russian military, it overlooked that the Russian military can tell the difference between a civilian airliner and a military airplane. The existence of the video itself implies that there was a plot to down the airliner and blame Russia.</p>
<p>I have seen reports that the Russian anti-aircraft missile system, as a safety device, is capable of contacting aircraft transponders in order to verify the type of aircraft. If the reports are correct and if the transponders from MH-17 are found, they might record the contact.</p>
<p>I have seen reports that Ukrainian air control changed the route of MH-17 and directed it to fly over the conflict area. The transponders should also indicate whether this is correct. If so, there clearly is at least circumstantial evidence that this was an intentional act on the part of Kiev, an act which would have required Washington’s blessing.</p>
<p>There are other reports that there is a divergence between the Ukrainian military and the unofficial militias formed by the right-wing Ukrainian extremists who apparently were the first to attack the separatists. It is possible that Washington used the extremists to plot the airliner’s destruction in order to blame Russia and use the accusations to pressure the EU to go along with Washington’s unilateral sanctions against Russia. We do know that Washington is desperate to break up the growing economic and political ties between Russia and Europe.</p>
<p>If it was a plot to down an airliner, any safety device on the missile system could have been turned off so as to give no warning or leave any telltale sign. That could be the reason a Ukrainian fighter was sent to inspect the airliner. Possibly the real target was Putin’s airliner and incompetence in implementing the plot resulted in the destruction of a civilian airliner.</p>
<p>As there are a number of possible explanations, let’s keep open minds and resist Washington’s propaganda until facts and evidence are in. In the very least, Washington is guilty of using the incident to blame Russia in advance of the evidence. All Washington has shown us so far are accusations and insinuations. If that is all Washington continues to show us, we will know where the blame resides.</p>
<p>In the meantime, remember the story of the boy who cried “wolf!” He lied so many times that when the wolf did come, no one believed him. Will this be Washington’s ultimate fate?</p>
<p>Instead of declaring war on Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, and Syria, why did Washington hide behind lies? If Washington wants war with Iran, Russia, and China, why not simply declare war? The reason that the US Constitution requires war to begin with a declaration of war by Congress is to prevent the executive branch from orchestrating wars in order to further hidden agendas. By abdicating its constitutional responsibility, the US Congress is complicit in the executive branch’s war crimes. By approving Israel’s premeditated murder of Palestinians, the US government is complicit in Israel’s war crimes.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this question: Would the world be a safer place with less death, destruction and displaced peoples and more truth and justice if the United States and Israel did not exist?</p>

<blockquote><p>“The unipolar world model has failed. People everywhere have shown their desire to choose their own destiny, preserve their own cultural identity, and oppose the West’s attempts at military, financial, political and ideological domination.”</p>
<p>- <em>Vladimir Putin</em></p>
<p>“While the human politics of the crisis in Ukraine garner all the headlines, it is the gas politics that in many ways lies at the heart of the conflict.”</p>
<p>- <em>Eric Draitser, <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/168832-waging-war-against-russia/">Waging war against Russia, one pipeline at a time</a>, RT</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What does a pipeline in Afghanistan have to do with the crisis in Ukraine?</p>
<p>Everything. It reveals the commercial interests that drive US policy. Just as the War in Afghanistan was largely fought to facilitate the transfer of natural gas from Turkmenistan to the Arabian Sea, so too, Washington engineered the bloody coup in Kiev to cut off energy supplies from Russia to Europe to facilitate the US pivot to Asia.</p>
<p>This is why policymakers in Washington are reasonably satisfied with the outcome of the war in Afghanistan despite the fact that none of the stated goals were achieved. Afghanistan is not a functioning democracy with a strong central government, drug trafficking has not been eradicated, women haven’t been liberated, and the infrastructure and school systems are worse than they were before the war. By every objective standard the war was a failure. But, of course, the stated goals were just public relations blather anyway. They don’t mean anything. What matters is gas, namely the vast untapped reserves in Turkmenistan that could be extracted by privately-owned US corporations who would use their authority to control the growth of US competitors or would-be rivals like China. That’s what the war was all about. The gas is going to be transported via a pipeline from Turkmenistan, across Afghanistan, Pakistan and India to the Arabian sea, eschewing Russian and Iranian territory. The completion of the so called TAPI pipeline will undermine the development of an Iranian pipeline, thus sabotaging the efforts of a US adversary.</p>
<p>The TAPI pipeline illustrates how Washington is aggressively securing the assets it needs to maintain its dominance for the foreseeable future. Now, check this out from The Express Tribune, July 5:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Officials of Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan are set to meet in Ashgabat next week to push ahead with a planned transnational gas pipeline connecting the four countries and reach a settlement on the award of the multi-billion-dollar project to US companies.</p>
<p>“The US is pushing the four countries to grant the lucrative pipeline contract to its energy giants. Two US firms – Chevron and ExxonMobil – are in the race to become consortium leaders, win the project and finance the laying of the pipeline,” a senior government official said while talking to The Express Tribune.</p>
<p>Washington has been lobbying for the gas supply project, called Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India (Tapi) pipeline, terming it an ideal scheme to tackle energy shortages in Pakistan. On the other side, it pressed Islamabad to shelve the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline because of a nuclear standoff with Tehran…</p>
<p>According to officials, Petroleum and Natural Resources Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will lead a delegation at the meeting of the TAPI pipeline steering committee on July 8 in Ashgabat.</p>
<p>…At present, bid documents are being prepared in consultation with the Asian Development Bank, which is playing the role of transaction adviser. The documents will be given to the two companies only for taking part in the tender.</p>
<p>Chevron is lobbying in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan to clinch a deal, backed by the US State Department. However, other companies could also become part of the consortium that will be led either by Chevron or ExxonMobil.” (<a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/731317/tapi-pipeline-officials-to-finalise-contract-award-in-ashgabat-next-week/">TAPI pipeline: Officials to finalise contract award in Ashgabat next week</a>, The Express Tribune)</p></blockquote>
<p>So the pipeline plan is finally moving forward and, as the article notes, “The documents will be given to the two companies only for taking part in the tender.”</p>
<p>Nice, eh? So the State Department applies a little muscle and “Voila”, Chevron and Exxon clinch the deal. How’s that for a free market?</p>
<p>And who do you think is going to protect that 1,000 mile stretch of pipeline through hostile Taliban-controlled Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Why US troops, of course, which is why US military bases are conveniently located up an down the pipeline route. Coincidence?</p>
<p>Not on your life. Operation “Enduring Freedom” is a bigger hoax than the threadbare war on terror.</p>
<p>So let’s not kid ourselves. The war had nothing to do with liberating women or bringing democracy to the unwashed masses. It was all about power politics and geostrategic maneuvering; stealing resources, trouncing potential rivals, and beefing up profits for the voracious oil giants. Who doesn’t know that already? Here’s more background from the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Earlier this month, President Obama sent a letter to (Turkmenistan) President Berdimuhamedow emphasizing a common interest in helping develop Afghanistan and expressing Mr. Obama’s support for TAPI and his desire for a major U.S. firm to construct it.</p>
<p>…Progress on TAPI will also jump-start many of the other trans-Afghan transport projects—including roads and railroads—that are at the heart of America’s “New Silk Road Strategy” for the Afghan economy.</p>
<p>The White House should understand that if TAPI isn’t built, neither U.S. nor U.N. sanctions will prevent Pakistan from building a pipeline from Iran.” (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324576304579072761923326266">The Pipeline That Could Keep the Peace in Afghanistan</a>, Wall Street Journal)</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you see what’s going on? Afghanistan, which is central to Washington’s pivot strategy, is going to be used for military bases, resource extraction and transportation. That’s it. There’s not going to be any reconstruction or nation building. The US doesn’t do that anymore. This is the stripped-down, no-frills, 21st century imperialism. “No nation for you, buddy. Just give us your gas and off we’ll go.” That’s how the system works now. It’s alot like Iraq –the biggest hellhole on earth–where “oil production has surged to its highest level in over 30 years”. (according to the Wall Street Journal) And who’s raking in the profits on that oil windfall?</p>
<p>Why the oil giants, of course. (ExxonMobil, BP and Shell) Maybe that’s why you never read about what a terrible mistake the war was. Because for the people who count, it really wasn’t a mistake at all. In fact, it all worked out pretty well.</p>
<p>Of course, the US will support the appearance of democracy in Kabul, but the government won’t have any real power beyond the capital. It never did anyway. (Locals jokingly called Karzai the “mayor of Kabul”) As for the rest of the country; it will be ruled by warlords as it has been since the invasion in 2001. (Remember the Northern Alliance? Hate to break the news, but they’re all bloodthirsty, misogynist warlords who were reinstated by Rumsfeld and Co.)</p>
<p>This is the new anarchic “Mad Max” template Washington is applying wherever it intervenes. The intention is to dissolve the nation-state in order to remove any obstacle to resource extraction, which is why failed states are popping up wherever the US sticks its big nose. It’s all by design. Chaos is the objective. Simply put: It’s easier to steal whatever one wants when there’s no center of power to resist.</p>
<p>This is why political leaders in Europe are so worried, because they don’t like the idea of sharing a border with Somalia, which is exactly what Ukraine is going to look like when the US is done with it.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, the US is using a divide and conquer strategy to pit the EU against trading partner Moscow. The State Department and CIA helped to topple Ukraine’s elected President Viktor Yanukovych and install a US stooge in Kiev who was ordered to cut off the flow of Russian gas to the EU and lure Putin into a protracted guerilla war in Ukraine. The bigwigs in Washington figured that, with some provocation, Putin would react the same way he did when Georgia invaded South Ossetia in 2006. But, so far, Putin has resisted the temptation to get involved which is why new puppet president Petro Poroshenko has gone all “Jackie Chan” and stepped up the provocations by pummeling east Ukraine mercilessly. It’s just a way of goading Putin into sending in the tanks.</p>
<p>But here’s the odd part: Washington doesn’t have a back-up plan. It’s obvious by the way Poroshenko keeps doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. That demonstrates that there’s no Plan B. Either Poroshenko lures Putin across the border and into the conflict, or the neocon plan falls apart, which it will if they can’t demonize Putin as a “dangerous aggressor” who can’t be trusted as a business partner.</p>
<p>So all Putin has to do is sit-tight and he wins, mainly because the EU needs Moscow’s gas. If energy supplies are terminated or drastically reduced, prices will rise, the EU will slide back into recession, and Washington will take the blame. So Washington has a very small window to draw Putin into the fray, which is why we should expect another false flag incident on a much larger scale than the fire in Odessa. Washington is going to have to do something really big and make it look like it was Moscow’s doing. Otherwise, their pivot plan is going to hit a brick wall. Here’s a tidbit readers might have missed in the Sofia News Agency’s novinite site:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ukraine’s Parliament adopted .. a bill under which up to 49% of the country’s gas pipeline network could be sold to foreign investors. This could pave the way for US or EU companies, which have eyed Ukrainian gas transportation system over the last months.</p>
<p>…Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk was earlier quoted as saying that the bill would allow Kiev to “attract European and American partners to the exploitation and modernization of Ukraine’s gas transportation,” in a situation on Ukraine’s energy market he described as “super-critical”. Critics of the bill have repeatedly pointed the West has long been interest in Ukraine’s pipelines, with some seeing in the Ukrainian revolution a means to get access to the system. (<a href="http://www.novinite.com/articles/161853/Ukraine+Allowed+to+Sell+Up+to+49+of+Gas+Pipeline+System">Ukraine allowed to sell up to 49% of gas pipeline system</a>, novinite.com)</p></blockquote>
<p>Boy, you got to hand it to the Obama throng. They really know how to pick their coup-leaders, don’t they? These puppets have only been in office for a couple months and they’re already giving away the farm.</p>
<p>And, such a deal! US corporations will be able to buy up nearly half of a pipeline that moves 60 percent of the gas that flows from Russia to Europe. That’s what you call a tollbooth, my friend; and US companies will be in just the right spot to gouge Moscow for every drop of natural gas that transits those pipelines. And gouge they will too, you can bet on it.</p>
<p>Is that why the State Department cooked up this loony putsch, so their fatcat, freeloading friends could rake in more dough?</p>
<p>This also explains why the Obama crowd is trying to torpedo Russia’s other big pipeline project called Southstream. Southstream is a good deal for Europe and Russia. On the one hand, it would greatly enhance the EU’s energy security, and on the other, it will provide needed revenues for Russia so they can continue to modernize, upgrade their dilapidated infrastructure, and improve standards of living. But “the proposed pipeline (which) would snake about 2,400 kilometers, or roughly 1,500 miles, from southern Russia via the Black Sea to Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary and ultimately Austria. (and) could handle about 60 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year, enough to allow Russian exports to Europe to largely bypass Ukraine” (New York Times) The proposed pipeline further undermines Washington’s pivot strategy, so Obama, the State Department and powerful US senators (Ron Johnson, John McCain, and Chris Murphy) are doing everything in their power to torpedo the project.</p>
<p>“What gives Vladimir Putin his power and control is his oil and gas reserves and West and Eastern Europe’s dependence on them,” Senator Johnson said in an interview. “We need to break up his stranglehold on energy supplies. We need to bust up that monopoly.” (New York Times)</p>
<p>What a bunch of baloney. Putin doesn’t have a monopoly on gas. Russia only provides 30 percent of the gas the EU uses every year. And Putin isn’t blackmailing anyone either. Countries in the EU can either buy Russian gas or not buy it. It’s up to them. No one has a gun to their heads. And Gazprom’s prices are competitive too, sometimes well-below market rates which has been the case for Ukraine for years, until crackpot politicians started sticking their thumb in Putin’s eye at every opportunity; until they decided that that they didn’t have to pay their bills anymore because, well, because Washington told them not to pay their bills. That’s why.</p>
<p>Ukraine is in the mess it’s in today for one reason, because they decided to follow Washington’s advice and shoot themselves in both feet. Their leaders thought that was a good idea. So now the country is broken, penniless and riven by social unrest. Regrettably, there’s no cure for stupidity.</p>
<p>The neocon geniuses apparently believe that if they sabotage Southstream and nail down 49 percent ownership of Ukraine’s pipeline infrastructure, then the vast majority of Russian gas will have to flow through Ukrainian pipelines. They think that this will give them greater control over Moscow. But there’s a glitch to this plan which analyst Jeffrey Mankoff pointed out in an article titled “Can Ukraine Use Its Gas Pipelines to Threaten Russia?”. Here’s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The biggest problem with this approach is a cut in gas supplies creates real risks for the European economy… In fact, Kyiv’s efforts to siphon off Russian gas destined to Europe to offset the impact of a Russian cutoff in January 2009 provide a window onto why manipulating gas supplies is a risky strategy for Ukraine. Moscow responded to the siphoning by halting all gas sales through Ukraine for a couple of weeks, leaving much of eastern and southern Europe literally out in the cold. European leaders reacted angrily, blaming both Moscow and Kyiv for the disruption and demanding that they sort out their problems. While the EU response would likely be somewhat more sympathetic to Ukraine today, Kyiv’s very vulnerability and need for outside financial support makes incurring European anger by manipulating gas supplies very risky.” (<a href="http://2paragraphs.com/2014/04/can-ukraine-use-its-gas-pipelines-as-threat-to-russia/">Can Ukraine Use Its Gas Pipelines to Threaten Russia</a>, two paragraphs)</p></blockquote>
<p>The funny thing about gas is that, when you stop paying the bills, they turn the heat off. Is that hard to understand?</p>
<p>So, yes, the State Department crystal-gazers and their corporate-racketeer friends might think they have Putin by the shorthairs by buying up Ukraine’s pipelines, but the guy who owns the gas (Gazprom) is still in the drivers seat. And he’s going to do what’s in the best interests of himself and his shareholders. Someone should explain to John Kerry that that’s just how capitalism works.</p>
<p>Washington’s policy in Ukraine is such a mess, it really makes one wonder about the competence of the people who come up with these wacko ideas. Did the brainiacs who concocted this plan really think they’d be able to set up camp between two major trading partners, turn off the gas, reduce a vital transit country into an Iraq-type basketcase, and start calling the shots for everyone in the region?</p>
<p>It’s crazy.</p>
<p>Europe and Russia are a perfect fit. Europe needs gas to heat its homes and run its machinery. Russia has gas to sell and needs the money to strengthen its economy. It’s a win-win situation. What Europe and Russia don’t need is the United States. In fact, the US is the problem. As long as US meddling persists, there’s going to be social unrest, division, and war. It’s that simple. So the goal should be to undermine Washington’s ability to conduct these destabilizing operations and force US policymakers to mind their own freaking business. That means there should be a concerted effort to abandon the dollar, ditch US Treasuries, jettison the petrodollar system, and force the US to become a responsible citizen that complies with International law.</p>
<p>It won’t happen overnight, but it will happen, mainly because everyone is sick and tired of all the troublemaking.</p>

				<p>July 5, 2014 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20713#respond" title="Comment on Class Warfare Saps The Economy: Why Abenomics Flopped"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="20713 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20713">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>By every objective standard, Abenomics has been a complete flop. Household spending has plunged, wages have dropped for 23 months in a row, inflation is on the rise, the number of workers who can only find part-time jobs has ballooned to 38 percent, and most economists now expect 2nd quarter GDP to shrink to minus 4 percent or worse. So where’s the silver lining?</p>
<p>There isn’t one. It’s all hype. In fact, the only part of Prime Minister’s Shinzo Abe’s economic strategy that has succeeded has been the public relations campaign, which has bamboozled the Japanese people into believing that pumping trillions of yen into financial assets will lead to widespread prosperity. Good luck with that. We can see how well that worked in the US where stock prices have nearly tripled in the last five years, but the real economy is still flat on its back. So why would quantitative easing (QE) work in Japan when it hasn’t worked in the US?</p>
<p>It hasn’t, and it won’t. The whole thing is a farce. But political leaders like Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their central bank lackeys continue to promote this absurd flimflam because it boosts profits for their constituents. That’s what this nonsense is all about; trying to find new ways to enrich the parasite class during a “self induced” long-term slump. The only problem is that everyone else is worse off than before, mainly because the silver spoon slackers at the top of the heap are getting a bigger and bigger share of the pie. That just leaves a few crumbs for everyone else, which is why economic activity has slowed to a crawl. It’s because the people who typically spend money and rev up the economy, have no money to spend. It’s that simple. Check out this blurb from the Testosterone Pit:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Abe administration is doing everything in the book to bolster the fortunes of Japan Inc.: offering tax cuts, more public works, and stimulus packages, snatching the Olympics by hook or crook, and cranking up inflation. In April, prices for all items soared 3.4% from a year earlier, and goods prices a confiscatory 5.2%. Yet wages were stuck in the mire, and adjusted for inflation, they plunged…</p>
<p>Then came the consumption tax hike, a broad-based tax that impacts consumers and businesses across the economy. The months before the effective date of April 1, consumers and businesses binged to save that extra 3% in taxes on big-ticket items, and businesses rang up sales faster than they could count.” <a href="http://www.testosteronepit.com/home/2014/6/11/japan-incs-worst-quarterly-outlook-since-the-2011-earthquake.html">Japan Inc.’s Worst Quarterly Outlook Since The 2011 Earthquake</a>, Testosterone Pit</p></blockquote>
<p>How do you like that? So, with the economy already on the ropes, class warrior Abe decided to squeeze working people even more by pushing through a regressive sales tax that put household spending into a nosedive. (Get a load of this ski-jump chart of <a href="http://soberlook.com/2014/06/japans-households-stung-by-consumption.html">household spending</a>)</p>
<p>But while Abe has been raising taxes on the workerbees, he’s cutting them for his crooked corporate buddies. As part of his dubious “growth strategy” the Japanese PM has promised to slash corporate taxes from 35 percent to 29 percent, a move that will reduce revenues and increase Japan’s humongous public debt even more. (Japan’s debt is already a gargantuan 240 percent of GDP.) Many analysts think that Abe’s move could trigger a panic in the bond market if investors start to think he’s not serious about addressing the debt. Even so, that’s a risk that Abe’s willing to take as long as it saves his cheesy corporate friends a few shekels.</p>
<p>Of course the best way to pay down the debt, is through economic growth. But that can’t be done when wages are either stagnant or dropping as they are in Japan. Check this out from mni market news:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Base wages, the key to a recovery in cash earnings, fell 0.2% on year, marking the 23rd consecutive decrease…. In real terms, total wages slumped 3.1% in April, showing the annual inflation rate above 1% is hurting household income in the absence of substantial wage growth and in light of the sales tax hike to 8% from 5% on April 1″. (<a href="https://mninews.marketnews.com/index.php/japan-apr-total-wages-post-2nd-straight-rise-base-wages-down?q=content/japan-apr-total-wages-post-2nd-straight-rise-base-wages-down">Japan Apr Total Wages Post 2nd Straight Rise</a>; Base Wages Down, MNI Market News)</p></blockquote>
<p>The economy can’t grow when demand is weak, and demand is perennially weak in Japan because wages and incomes are shriveling. That means less personal consumption, less economic activity, and smaller GDP. Recently, the situation has gotten worse due to the Bank of Japan’s money printing operations which have increased inflation which has reduced worker’s buying power. Check this out form the Japan Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Consumer prices climbed in May at their fastest pace in 32 years, swelled by the hike in the consumption tax and higher utility charges that are squeezing Japanese budgets as wage gains remain limited.</p>
<p>Consumer prices excluding fresh food but not energy, rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said Friday…Household spending subsequently sank 8 percent, more than the forecast fall of 2.3 percent, separate data showed…</p>
<p>All 14 major gas and electricity companies raised prices from May to the highest level since the current pricing system began in May 2009, according to the Asahi Shimbun. Tokyo Electric Power Co. announced a price hike of 5.3 percent in May for households, reflecting the higher tax, rising energy costs and other factors.” (<a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/06/27/business/economy-business/prices-climb-most-in-32-years-as-wages-limp-along/#.U63gQsLjjcs">Prices climb most in 32 years as wages limp along</a>, Japan Times)</p></blockquote>
<p>So, with prices rising and wages stagnant, Japan is experiencing what most analysts anticipated when Abe first announced his plan to hike the sales tax, that is, household spending has dropped precipitously increasing the likelihood of another recession. Abe decided that pushing more of the government’s operating costs onto working people was more important than the health of the economy.</p>
<p>Naturally, Abe’s policies have had a catastrophic effect on the working poor. As we noted earlier, the number of part-time workers in Japan has grown dramatically over the last few years. According to Reuters,</p>
<blockquote><p>“part-time, temporary and other non-regular workers who typically make less than half the average pay has jumped 70 percent from 1997 to 19.7 million today — 38 percent of the labor force.”</p>
<p>Abenomics has made life considerably harder for these people due to the higher taxes, soaring prices, and reduced welfare benefits. The data show that Japan’s poverty rate is “the sixth-worst among the 34 OECD countries” while “child poverty in working, single-parent households is by far the worst at over 50 percent, making Japan the only country where having a job does not reduce the poverty rate for that group.” (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/15/us-japan-economy-poverty-idUSBREA4D0U820140515">Japan’s working poor left behind by Abenomics</a>, Reuters)</p></blockquote>
<p>Abe’s attack on working people has intensified in the last few weeks as he’s unveiled parts of his “third arrow” of structural reforms. Along with cutting corporate taxes, Abe wants to take the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), “the world’s deepest pot of savings”, and shove it in the stock market. George W. Bush wanted to do the same thing with Social Security but abandoned the idea after Lehman Brothers collapsed and the economy tanked. Now Abe is pushing the same loony plan which will put the long-term security of Japan’s elderly at risk just to boost profits for his voracious plutocrat friends.</p>
<p>Abe also wants to eliminate overtime pay, make it easier for corporate bosses to fire workers, and allow foreign workers to care for children and the elderly in a series of “special economic zones”. All of the so called “reforms” are just ways of extracting more wealth from labor by loosening regulations. None of them have anything to do with increasing productivity, boosting capital investment or sparking more innovation. They’re all about wringing every last dime out of the people who are already so broke they can barley keep their heads above water.</p>
<p>On top of it all, Abe’s easy money policies have ignited the same flurry of “irrational exuberance” they have in the US. As Marketwatch notes, “A greater number of investors are demanding increased dividends and share buybacks than (ever) before.”</p>
<p>Stock buybacks are a particularly execrable activity that pumps up stock prices without adding anything to productivity. It’s pure-unalloyed asset inflation prompted by insanely loose monetary policies. Here’s more from Marketwatch:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Japanese companies … are sitting on a record amount of cash: about $3 trillion at the end of March …</p>
<p>A number of large Japanese companies, including Toyota, NTT Docomo and Mitsubishi Corp., have announced plans for big stock buybacks, which improve shareholder returns by increasing the value of the remaining shares outstanding.” (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-japan-dividends-buybacks-take-the-stage-2014-06-25-194854819?reflink=MW_news_stmp">In Japan, dividends, buybacks take the stage</a>, Marketwatch)</p></blockquote>
<p>Yipee! Shareholders are getting richer on Abe’s idiot programs. Too bad they’ll be gone when the bubble bursts and the system plunges back into crisis.</p>
<p>What a screwball system.</p>
<p>Abenomics has nothing to do with prosperity, growth or even deflation. That’s all BS. The policy is designed to do exactly what it does, generate hefty profits for slacker speculators and corporate muck-a-mucks while everyone else faces higher prices, lower wages and a dimmer future.</p>
<p>If that’s not class warfare, then what is it?</p>

			<p><strong>Did Obama Know that ISIS Planned to Invade Iraq?</strong></p>
<div><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Obamaheli3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<blockquote><p>“I think we have to understand first how we got here. We have been arming ISIS (the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) in Syria.  ISIS, an al Qaeda offshoot, has been collaborating with the Syrian rebels whom the Obama administration has been arming in their efforts to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.”  - <em>Senator Rand Paul, Interview CNN </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Today’s head-scratcher: How could a two-mile long column of jihadi-filled white Toyota Land rovers barrel across the Syrian border into Iraq–sending plumes of dust up into the atmosphere –without US spy satellites detecting their whereabouts when those same satellites can read a damn license plate from outer space? And why has the media failed to inquire about this massive Intelligence failure?</p>
<p>Barack Obama is a big proponent of “inclusive democracy” which is why he wants Iraqi prime minister Nouri al Maliki to either include more Sunnis in the government or resign as PM. In an interview with CNN, Obama said, “We gave Iraq the chance to have an inclusive democracy, to work across sectarian lines to provide a better future for their children and unfortunately what we’ve seen is a breakdown of trust…There’s no doubt that there has been a suspicion for quite some time now amongst Sunnis that they have no access to using the political process to deal with their grievances, and that is in part the reason why a better-armed and larger number of Iraqi security forces melted away when an extremist group, Isis, started rolling through the western portions of Iraq.</p>
<p>“Part of the task now is to see whether Iraqi leaders are prepared to rise above sectarian motivations, come together, and compromise. If they can’t there’s not going to be a military solution to this problem … There’s no amount of American firepower that’s going to be able to hold the country together and I’ve made that very clear to Mr Maliki and all the other leadership inside of Iraq (that) they don’t have a lot of time.” (New York Times)</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks Obama  gives a rip about sectarian problems in Iraq needs his head examined. That’s the lamest excuse for a policy position since the Bush administration announced they were sending troops to Afghanistan to “liberate” women from having to wear headscarves.  If Obama was serious about “inclusive democracy” as he calls it, then he’d withhold the $1.3 billion from his new dictator buddy, Generalissimo al Sisi of Egypt who toppled the democratically-elected government in Cairo, installed himself as top-dog in conspicuously rigged elections, and is now planning to execute 200-plus Egyptians for being members of a party that was legal just a few months ago.   Do you think Obama is pestering al-Sisi to be “more inclusive”?  No way. He doesn’t care how many people are executed in Egypt, anymore than he cares whether al Maliki blocks Sunnis from a spot in the government. What matters to Obama and his deep-state puppetmasters is regime change, that is, getting rid of a nuisance who hasn’t followed Washington’s directives. That’s what this is all about. Obama and Co. want to give al Maliki the old heave-ho because he refused to let US troops stay in Iraq past the 2012 deadline and because he’s too close to Tehran. Two strikes and you’re out, at least that’s how Washington plays the game.</p>
<p>So Maliki has got to go, and all the hoopla over sectarian issues is just pabulum for the News Hour. It means nothing. The real goal is regime change. That, and the partitioning of Iraq. In fact, the de facto partitioning of Iraq has already taken place. The Sunnis have basically seized the part of the country where they plan to live. The Kurds have nailed down their own territory, and the Shia will get Baghdad and the rest, including Basra. So, the division of Iraq has already a done deal, just as long as al Maliki doesn’t  gum up the works by deploying his army to retake the parts of the country that are now occupied by ISIS. But the Obama team probably won’t allow that to happen, mainly because the bigshots in Washington like things the way they are now. They want an Iraq that is broken into smaller chunks and ruled by tribal leaders and warlords. That’s what this is all about, splitting up the country along the lines that were laid out in an Israeli plan authored by Oded Yinon 30 years ago.  That plan has already been implemented which means Iraq, as we traditionally think of it, no longer exists. It’s kaput. Obama and Co. made sure of that.  They weren’t satisfied with just killing a million Iraqis, polluting the environment, poisoning the water, destroying the schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, and leaving them to scrape by on meager rations, foul water and a tattered electrical grid. They had to come back and annihilate the state itself, erase the lines on the map,  and remove any trace of a nation that was once a prosperous Middle East hub. Now the country is gone, vanished overnight. Poof. Now you see it, now you don’t.</p>
<p>Of course, al Maliki could try to reverse the situation, but he’s got his own problems to deal with. It’s going to be hard enough for him just to hold onto power, let alone launch a sustained attack on a disparate band of cutthroats who are bent on wreaking havoc on oil wells, critical infrastructure, pipelines, reservoirs, etc as well as killing as many infidels as humanly possible. No matter how you cut it, al Maliki is going to have his hands full.  Obama has already made it plain, that he’s gunning for him and won’t rest until he’s gone. In fact, Secretary of State John Kerry is in the Middle East right now trying to drum up support for the “Dump Maliki” campaign. His first stopover was Cairo. Here’s a wrap-up form the Sunday Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Cairo on Sunday morning on the first leg of a trip that is intended to hasten the formation of a cross-sectarian government in Iraq. In his swing through Middle East capitals, Mr. Kerry plans to send two messages on Iraq. One is that Arab states should use their influence with Iraqi politicians and prod them to quickly form an inclusive government. Another is that they should crack down on funding to the Sunni militants in the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The group is largely self-sustaining because of success in extortion and its plundering of banks in Mosul, Iraq. But some funding “has flowed into Iraq from its neighbors,” said a senior official on Mr. Kerry’s plane.” (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/world/middleeast/kerry-arrives-in-cairo-on-trip-to-help-form-new-iraqi-government.html?hp&amp;_r=1">Kerry Arrives in Cairo on Trip to Push for New Iraqi Government</a>, New York Times)</p></blockquote>
<p>How’s that for priorities? First we get rid of al Maliki, says Kerry, then we move on to less important matters, like that  horde of jihadi desperados who are descending on Baghdad like a swarm of locusts. Doesn’t that seem a little backasswards to you, dear reader?</p>
<p>And why isn’t Obama worried about a jihadi attack on Baghdad?   Think of it: If they did attack Baghdad and the capital fell into jihadi hands, then what? Well, then the Dems would take the blame, they’d get their butts whooped in the upcoming midterms, and Madame Hillary would have to take up needlepoint because her chances of winning the 2014 presidential balloting would drop to zero.  So, the fallout would be quite grave. Still, Obama’s not sweating it, in fact, he’s not the least bit worried. Why?</p>
<p>Could it be that he knows something that we don’t know?  Could it be that US Intel agents have already made contact with these yahoos and gotten a commitment that they won’t attack Baghdad if they are allowed to remain in the predominantly Sunni areas which they already occupy? Is that it? Did Obama offer the Baathists and Takfiris a quid pro quo which they graciously accepted?</p>
<p>It’s very likely, mainly because it achieves Obama’s strategic objective of establishing a de facto partition that will remain in effect unless al Maliki can whip up an army to retake lost ground which looks doubtful at this point.</p>
<p>But, here’s the glitch;  al Maliki is not a quitter, and he’s not going anywhere. In fact he’s digging in his heels. He’s not going to be blackmailed by the likes of Obama. He’s going to this fight tooth and nail. And he’s going to have help too, because young Shia males are flocking to the recruiting offices to join the army and the militias. And then there’s Russia; in a surprise announcement  Russian president Vladimir Putin offered to assist al Maliki in the fight against the terrorists, a move that is bound to enrage Washington. Here’s a clip from the Daily Star:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday offered Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki Moscow’s total backing for the fight against jihadist fighters who have swept across the Middle East country.</p>
<p>“Putin confirmed Russia’s complete support for the efforts of the Iraqi government to speedily liberate the territory of the republic from terrorists,” the Kremlin said in a statement following a phone call between the two leaders…<br />
Russia is one of the staunchest allies of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad and has helped prop up his regime during three years of fighting against a hotchpotch of rebel groups, including the ISIL.”  ( <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Jun-20/260938-putin-offers-iraqs-maliki-complete-support-against-jihadists.ashx#ixzz35Nr2qH7M">Putin offers Iraq’s Maliki ‘complete support’ against jihadists</a>, Daily Star)</p></blockquote>
<p>That makes a third front in which Russia and the US will be on opposite sides. It’s just like the good old days, right?  Putin seems to be resigned to the idea that Moscow and Washington are going to be at loggerheads in the future. He’s not only opposed to a “unitary world order”, he’s doing something about it, putting himself and his country’s future at risk in order to stop the empire’s relentless expansion and vicious wars of aggression.  Needless to say, proxy wars like this can lead to rapid escalation which is always a concern when both parties have nuclear weapons at their disposal.  Now check this out from the Oil Price website:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Here’s why the threat goes beyond Iraq and Syria…Modern Syria is bordered by Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan and Israel to the south and Lebanon to the west.</p>
<p>‘Greater Syria’ incorporates most of the territories of each.</p>
<p>This is what ‘Syria’ means in the mind of Middle Easterners, says Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, and author of the respected blog SyriaComment.com</p>
<p>‘If we can teach people that so many Arabs still think of Syria as Greater Syria, they will begin to understand the extent to which Sykes-Picot remains challenged in the region,’ said Landis.</p>
<p>Sykes-Picot, of course refers to the secret agreement drawn up by two British and French diplomats — Sir Mark Sykes and Francois George-Picot — at the end of Word War I dividing the spoils of the Ottoman Empires between Britain and France by drawing straight lines in the sand.</p>
<p>To this day, many Arabs refuse to accept that division and think of ‘Syria’ as ‘Greater Syria.’ Some go so far as to include the Arab countries of North Africa – which from the Nile to the Euphrates forms ‘the Fertile Crescent,’ the symbol of many Muslim countries from Tunisia to Turkey. And some even go as far as including the island of Cyprus, saying it represents the star next to the crescent.</p>
<p>Given that, anyone who thinks ISIS will stop with Iraq is delusional.”  (<a href="http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Why-ISIS-Wont-Stop-With-Iraq.html">Insiders reveal real US aims in redrawing map of ME: Greater Syria</a>, oil price)</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting, eh? So, if Mr. Landis is right, then the fracas in Iraq and Syria might just be the tip of the iceberg. It could be that Washington, Tel Aviv and Riyadh –who we think are the driving force behind this current wave of violence–have a much more ambitious plan in mind for the future. If this new method of effecting regime change succeeds,  then the sky’s the limit. Maybe they’ll try the same stunt in other countries too, like Turkey, Tunisia, Cyprus, and all the way to North Africa. Why not? If the game plan is to Balkanize Arab countries wholesale and transform them into powerless fiefdoms overseen by US proconsuls and local warlords, why not go on a regime change spree?</p>
<p>By the way, according to the Telegraph, Obama and friends knew what ISIS was up to, and knew that the terrorist group was going to launch attacks on cities in the Sunni territories, just as they have. Get a load of this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Five months ago, a Kurdish intelligence “asset” walked into a base and said he had information to hand over. The capture by jihadists the month before of two Sunni cities in western Iraq was just the beginning, he said.<br />
There would soon be a major onslaught on Sunni territories.</p>
<p>The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (Isis), a renegade offshoot of al-Qaeda, was about to take its well-known cooperation with leftovers of the regime of Saddam Hussein,  and his former deputy Izzat al-Douri, to a new level.</p>
<p>His handlers knew their source of old, and he had always proved reliable, officials told The Telegraph. So they listened carefully as he said a formal alliance was about to be signed that would lead to the takeover of Mosul, the biggest city north of Baghdad, home to two million people. …</p>
<p>‘We had this information then, and we passed it on to your (British) government and the US government,’ Rooz Bahjat, a senior lieutenant to Lahur Talabani, head of Kurdish intelligence, said. ‘We used our official liaisons.’</p>
<p>‘We knew exactly what strategy they were going to use, we knew the military planners. It fell on deaf ears.’  (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10918607/How-US-and-Britain-were-warned-of-Isis-advance-in-Iraq-but-turned-a-deaf-ear.html">How US and Britain were warned of Isis advance in Iraq but ‘turned a deaf ear</a>, Telegraph)</p></blockquote>
<p>“Deaf ears”?</p>
<p>I’m not buying it. I think the intelligence went straight to the top, where Obama and his neocon colleagues came up with the plan that is unfolding as we speak. They figured, if they just look the other way and let these homicidal madhatters seize a few cities and raise a little Hell, they’d be able to kill two birds with one stone, that is,  get rid of al Mailiki and partition the country at the same time. But, it’s not going to work out like Obama expects, mainly because this is just about the dumbest plan ever conjured up. I would give it an 80 percent chance blowing up in Obama’s face in less than a month’s time. This turkey has failure written all over it.</p>
<p>As for the sectarian issue, well, Iraq was never a sectarian society until the war.  The problems arose due to a deliberate policy to pit one sect against the other in order to change the narrative of what was really going on the ground. And what was really going on was a very successful guerilla war was being waged by opponents of the US occupation who were launching in excess of 100 attacks per day on US soldiers. To change the storyline–which was causing all kinds of problems at home where support for the war was rapidly eroding–US counterinsurgency masterminds concocted a goofy plan to blow up the Golden Dome Mosque, blame it on the Sunnis, and then unleash the most savage, genocidal counterinsurgency operation of all-time. The western media were instructed to characterize developments in Iraq as part of a bloody civil war between Shia and Sunnis. But it was all a lie. The bloodletting was inevitable result of US policy which the Guardian effectively chronicled in a shocking, but indispensable hour-long video which can be seen here. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/mar/06/james-steele-america-iraq-video">James Steele: America’s mystery man in Iraq</a> - video</p>
<p>The US made every effort to fuel sectarian animosities to divert attention from the attacks on US soldiers. And due to a savage and deceptive counterinsurgency plan that employed death squads, torture, assassinations, and massive ethnic cleansing,  they succeeded in confusing Iraqis as to who was really behind the daily atrocities, the human rights violations and the mountain of carnage.</p>
<p>You’d have to be a fool to blame al-Maliki for any of this. As brutal as he may be, he’s not responsible for the divisions in Iraqi society. That’s all Washington’s doing.  Just as Washington is entirely responsible for the current condition of the country and for the million or so people who were killed in the war.</p>

Nor was Adam created by the One God in three Persons as a living soul embodied in flesh, fully person, fully man right from the beginning.   Adam and Eve, if they even existed were emergent products of evolution, their closest relative soulless hominids.  Thus the events described in Genesis are not meant to convey the miraculous creation ex nihilo but the scientific &#8216;reality&#8217; that the universe has an impotent creator that made and ignited a Cosmic Egg (Big Bang) which generated matter and energy. Then after billions of years of God-directed evolution eventuating in the suffering and death of millions of life-forms (God&#8217;s fault, btw) man inexplicably fell from grace even though God is the guilty party, the real cause of death and suffering.  </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">According to this counter-intuitive Gnostic-laced tale of nonsense, evolutionary science, not God&#8217;s Revelation, is a reality in nature explainable by reason and empirical observation and faithful Christians who deny this are in denial of reality.  Faithful Christians who actually affirm the Revelation of God and Special Creation are guilty of defending the backwards, anti-scientific, anti-evolution &#8216;fundamentalist&#8217; interpretation of the book of Genesis thus are not only a cause of embarrassment to fashionably-correct, scientifically enlightened Christians, but are also guilty of harming Christianity.

He received the idea from his nature-worshipping pagan grandfather Erasmus Darwin, an important name in European Masonic anti-Christian Church organizations engaged in destructive revolutionary activism. Erasmus mentored his grandson Charles: </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;</span><em style="color: #000000;">Dr. Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) was the first man in England to suggest those ideas which were later to be embodied in the Darwinian theory by his grandson, Charles Darwin (1809-1882) who wrote in 1859 Origin of Species</em><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221; (Scarlet and the Beast, Vol. II, John Daniel, p. 34) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">According to anthropologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, longtime director of the American Museum of Natural History, ancient pagans are the inventers of modern evolutionism. In the introduction to his history of evolutionism Osborn wrote:</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8220;</span><em style="color: #000000;">When I began the search for anticipations of the evolutionary theory&#8230;.I was led back to the Greek natural philosophers and I was astonished to find how many of the pronounced and basic features of the Darwinian theory were anticipated even as far back as the seventh century B.C.&#8221; </em><span style="color: #000000;">(Osborn, From the Greeks to Darwin, p. xi) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">By its’ nature evolutionism belongs to the category of naturalism (all that exists is nature or cosmos), making it antithetical, or in fierce opposition to the infinite Triune God, the supernatural dimension and special creation.  The personal Triune God is outside of His creation&#8212;the natural dimension of space, time, matter and energy&#8212;thus He is not subject to the laws of science: </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;&#8230;.</span><em style="color: #000000;">science has no satisfactory answer to the question of the origin of life on the earth. Perhaps the appearance of life on the earth is a miracle. Scientists are reluctant to accept that view, but their choices are limited: either life was created on the earth by the will of a being outside the grasp of scientific understanding, or it evolved on our planet spontaneously, through chemical reactions occurring in nonliving matter lying on the surface of the planet. The first theory places the question of the origin of life beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. It is a statement of faith in the power of a Supreme Being not subject to the laws of science. The second theory is also an act of faith. The act of faith consists in assuming that the scientific view of the origin of life is correct, without having concrete evidence to support that belief.</em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8221; (Until the Sun Dies, Robert Jastrow, Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, pp. 62-63, 1977) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Only by conceptually murdering the supernatural Triune God and replacing Him with a ‘god’ within the natural dimension (naturalism), thus subject to scientific inquiry, can intellectually arrogant theologians presume to speak for god, claiming that he made and exploded a Cosmic Egg and directs evolutionary transformism together with the rest of their twisted theology dressed in Christian clothing.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> As an idea evolution is like an onion consisting of multitudinous layers of esoteric meaning.  Darwin&#8217;s theory occupies two or three layers. The many other layers already existed prior to Erasmus going back to the Renaissance and before that to ancient Chaldea and India thence to ancient Greece and Rome where evolution is always and everywhere connected to reincarnation and spiritual evolution (transformism).    </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">On ancient pagan conceptions of reincarnation and spiritual evolution early Church Father Gregory of Nyssa said: </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><em style="color: #000000;">&#8220;[I]f one should search carefully, he will find that their doctrine is of necessity brought down to this.

Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science – the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures and spiritual evolution is the best proof of the divinity of Christ.  (God and the Knowledge of Reality, Thomas Molnar, pp. 78-79) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Father Richard John Neuhaus pulls all of these occult traditions together in his analysis of modern evolutionary scientism as a revitalization of ancient spiritual traditions closely connected to elemental spirits. In his book, “American Babylon,” Neuhaus argues that astrological elemental spirits (powers and principalities) have been recast as, </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;&#8230;</span><em style="color: #000000;">evolutionary dynamics, life forces, or laws of nature.&#8221; Though described as laws rather than spirits, these elemental &#8220;forces&#8221;&#8230;. work their inexorable ways in cold indifference to reason, to will, to love, and to hope. In short, it is suggested that the elemental spirits are in charge and that human freedom is a delusion.&#8221; </em><span style="color: #000000;">(p. 226)</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> Despite that modern evolutionary theologians validate their esoteric projects as empirical or observational science in reality observational science is their enemy.   For instance, evolutionary theology alleges that hominids are supposed to be our ancestors, the so-called transitional life-forms linking modern humans to the common ancestor of all life.    </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">However, the hominid claim has fallen flat on its’ face, said Carl Wieland.

It is the argument that evolution is entirely compatible with the Bible when Genesis, especially the first three chapters, is viewed in its entirety in a non-literal, non-historical context. This is not a heresy unique to modern times. The early Church Fathers dealt with this heresy as well, counting it among the heretical tendencies of apostate Jewish Cabbalists, Origenists and Gnostic pagans such as Simon Magus. </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Fourth-century Fathers such as John Chrysostom, Basil the Great and Ephraim the Syrian, all of whom wrote commentaries on Genesis, specifically warned against treating Genesis as an unhistorical myth or allegory. John Chrysostom strongly warned against paying heed to these heretics, </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">“…</span><em style="color: #000000;">let us stop up our hearing against them, and let us believe the Divine Scripture, and following what is written in it, let us strive to preserve in our souls sound dogmas</em><span style="color: #000000;">.” (Genesis, Creation, and Early Man, Fr.

No one really knows if there was only one Big Bang or other bigger bangs as well; whether we live in a universe or multi-verse; whether life evolved on this planet or came from outer space . . . but if you want a tenured position in a university, and if you want your research projects funded, you have to toe politically correct storyline – champion dogma</em><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221;  (How Did the West&#8217;s &#8216;Rational Animal&#8217; Become Incapable of Using Reason?

<blockquote><p>“This deployment of strategic bombers provides an invaluable opportunity to strengthen and improve interoperability with our allies and partners.”</p>
<p><em>– Admiral Cecil Haney, commander, US Strategic Command on the deployment of B-2 stealth bombers to Europe.</em></p>
<p>“Against stupidity, no amount of planning will prevail.” <em> &#8211; Carl von Clausewitz</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Less than 24 hours after Ukraine’s new president Petro Poroshenko announced his determination to retake Crimea from Russia, US Admiral Cecil Haney confirmed that the US Air Force had deployed two B-2 stealth bombers to Europe to conduct military exercises. The addition of the multipurpose B-2, which is capable of delivering nuclear weapons, is intended to send a message to Moscow that the United States is prepared to provide backup for Ukraine’s fledgling government and to protect its interests in Central Asia. News of the deployment was reported in the Russian media, but was excluded by all the western news outlets.</p>
<p>The B-2 announcement was preceded by <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article38737.htm">an inflammatory speech by Poroshenko</a> at the presidential “swearing in” ceremony in Kiev. In what some analysts have called a “declaration of war”, Poroshenko promised to wrest control of Crimea from Russia which annexed the region just months earlier following a public referendum that showed 90 percent support for the measure. Here’s part of what Poroshenko said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The issue of territorial integrity of Ukraine is not subject to discussion…I have just sworn ‘with all my deeds to protect the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,’ and I will always be faithful to this sacred promise…</p>
<p>“Russia occupied Crimea, which was, is and will be Ukrainian soil…Yesterday, in the course of the meeting in Normandy, I told this to President Putin: Crimea is Ukraine soil. Period. There can be no compromise on the issues of Crimea, European choice and state structure…” (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/world/europe/poroshenko-sworn-in-as-president-of-strife-torn-ukraine.html?hpw&amp;rref=world&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, the day before Poroshenko was sworn in, “President Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron set a deadline for Russia to comply with its demands or face harsher economic sanctions that would be imposed by members of the G-7. Once again, the threat of new sanctions was largely ignored by the western media but was reported in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Here’s an excerpt from the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To avoid even harsher sanctions.. Putin must meet three conditions: Recognize Petro Poroshenko’s election as the new leader in Kiev; stop arms from crossing the border; and cease support for pro-Russian separatist groups concentrated in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>“If these things don’t happen, then sectoral sanctions will follow…”</p>
<p>Obama said the G-7 leaders unanimously agree with the steps Cameron outlined.” (<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.597235">Haaretz</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States is ratcheting up the pressure in order to widen the conflict and force Russian president Vladimir Putin to meet their demands. It’s clear that the threat of sanctions, Poroshenko’s belligerent rhetoric, and the steady buildup of military assets and troops in the region, that Obama and Co. still think they can draw Putin into the conflict and make him look like a dangerous aggressor who can’t be trusted by his EU partners. Fortunately, Putin has not fallen into the trap. He’s resisted the temptation to send in the tanks to put an end to the violence in Donetsk, Lugansk and Slavyansk. This has undermined Washington’s plan to deploy NATO to Russia’s western border, assert control over the “bridgehead” between Europe and Asia, and stop the further economic integration between Russia and the EU. So far, Putin has out-witted his adversaries at every turn, but there are still big challenges ahead, particularly the new threats from Poroshenko.</p>
<p>If Poroshenko is determined to take Crimea back from Moscow, then there’s going to be a war. But there are indications that he is more pragmatic than his speeches would suggest. In a private meeting with Putin at the D-Day ceremonies in France, the Ukrainian president said he had a plan to “immediately stop the bloodshed”</p>
<p>Here’s how Putin summarized his meeting with Poroshenko:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Poroshenko has a plan in this respect; it is up to him to say what kind of plan it is… I cannot say for sure how these plans will be implemented, but I liked the general attitude, it seemed right to me, so, if it happens this way, there will be conditions to develop our relations, in other areas, including economy.</p>
<p>“It’s important to stop the punitive actions in the southeast without a delay. That’s the only way to create conditions for the start of a real process of negotiations with the supporters of federalization. No one has yet said anything concrete to the people (living in the southeast of Ukraine) and nothing practical has been offered to them. People there simply don’t understand how they’ll live in the future and what the parameters of the new Constitution will look like.” (<a href="http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/735154">Poroshenko tells Putin of plan to immediately stop bloodshed in Ukraine</a>, Itar-Tass)</p></blockquote>
<p>If the report is accurate, then there’s reason to hope that Poroshenko is moving in Russia’s direction on most of the key issues which are; greater autonomy for the people in East Ukraine, Constitutional provisions that will protect them from future abuse by Kiev, and an immediate end to the violence. Putin has sought assurances on these issues from the very beginning of the crisis. Now it looks like he might get his way. Of course, it is impossible to know, since Poroshenko is sending mixed messages.</p>
<p>So why is Poroshenko sounding so conciliatory in his private meetings with Putin, but so belligerent in public?</p>
<p>It could be any number of things, but it probably has a lot to do with Monday’s scheduled tripartite meetings of representatives from the European Union, Ukraine and Russia. These meetings will have incalculable impact of Ukriane’s economic future. They will resolve the issues of price for future gas purchases as well as a plan for settling all previous claims. (Russia says that Ukraine owes $3.5 billion in back payments for natural gas.)</p>
<p>On April 1, Gazprom cancelled Ukraine’s discount and raised the price of gas to 485.5 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters nearly doubling the rate of payment. (It had been $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters) It is impossible to overstate the impact this will have Ukraine’s economy. Even Ukrainian hardline Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk was candid in his dire assessment of the situation. He said, “I could have made a populist statement but it is not true. We cannot refrain from using Russian gas.”</p>
<p>If Poroshenko sounds conciliatory, this is why.</p>
<p>Putin refused to discuss the gas issue with the media, but implied that political developments in Ukraine would factor heavily into any decision by Gazprom.</p>
<p>“Russia will be compelled to enact economic protection measures to defend its market if Ukraine signs the association agreement with the EU. “As soon as that accord is signed, we’ll start taking measures to defend our economy,” Putin said. (Itar-Tass)</p>
<p>In other words, if Ukraine doesn’t play ball, it’s going to have to go-it-alone. Kiev cannot expect “most favored trade partner-status”, gas discounts, or other perks if they’re going to stab Moscow in the back and jump into bed with the EU. That’s just not the way things work. Putin is merely warning Poroshenko to think about what he’s about to do before taking the plunge. ( “Average gas prices for Ukrainian households began rising by more than 50 percent in May, and heating prices are expected to climb by about 40 percent, starting in July.” World Socialist Web Site)</p>
<p>This is a much more important issue that most analysts seem to grasp. Many seem to think that IMF, EU and US loans and other assistance can buoy Ukraine’s sinking economy and restore it to health. But that’s a pipedream. In a “must read” report by the Brookings Institute, authors Clifford G. Gaddy and Barry W. Ickes spell it out in black and white, that is, that “Ukraine is a prize that neither Russia nor the West can afford to win.” Here’s a clip from the text:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is clear to most observers that the West would not be able to defend Ukraine economically from a hostile Russia…The simple fact is that Russia today supports the Ukrainian economy to the tune of at least $5 billion, perhaps as much as $10 billion, each year…</p>
<p>When we talk about subsidies, we usually think of Russia’s ability to offer Ukraine cheap gas — which it does when it wants to. But there are many more ways Russia supports Ukraine, only they are hidden. The main support comes in form of Russian orders to Ukrainian heavy manufacturing enterprises. This part of Ukrainian industry depends almost entirely on demand from Russia. They wouldn’t be able to sell to anyone else…</p>
<p>If the West were somehow able to wrest full control of Ukraine from Russia, could the United States, the other NATO nations, and the EU replace Russia’s role in eastern Ukraine? The IMF, of course, would never countenance supporting these dinosaurs the way the Russians have. So the support would have to come in the way of cash transfers to compensate for lost jobs. How much are we talking about? The only known parallel for the amount of transfer needed is the case of German reunification. The transfer amounted to 2 trillion euros, or $2.76 trillion, over 20 years. If Ukraine has per capita income equal to one-tenth of Germany’s, then a minimum estimate is $276 billion to buy off the east. (In fact, since the population size of eastern Ukraine is larger than East Germany’s, this is an underestimate.) It is unthinkable that the West would pay this amount.” (<a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2014/05/21-ukraine-prize-russia-west-ukraine-gaddy-ickes">Ukraine: A Prize Neither Russia Nor the West Can Afford to Win</a>, Brookings)</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors go on to show that “a NATO-affiliated Ukraine — is simply impossible under any real-world conditions” because it assumes that Russia will either “become an enthusiastic EU and NATO member itself” (or) “will it return to being the bankrupt, dependent, and compliant Russia of the 1990s.” In other words, the Obama administration’s strategic objectives in Ukraine do not jibe with economic reality. The US cannot afford to win in Ukraine, that’s the bottom line. Even so, we are convinced the aggression will persist regardless of the presumed outcome. The train has already left the station.</p>
<p>At the D-Day ceremonies, Putin and Poroshenko also met briefly with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande although the content of their discussions was not revealed. Public support for the two leaders’ Ukraine policy is gradually withering as the fighting continues in the East without any end in sight. An article in the popular German newspaper Die Zeit indicates that elite opinion in Europe is gradually shifting and no longer sees Washington’s Ukraine policy as being in its interests.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief summary from the WSWS: “It goes on to argue that Washington’s aggression is laying the foundations for a Chinese-Russian-Iranian axis that “would force the West to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy to secure its access to important but dwindling raw materials such as oil.” In opposition to this, the commentary insists that Germany’s independent interests lie “with preserving and deepening Europe’s relations with Russia,” while pursuing similar ties with Iran.” (<a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/06/07/pers-j07.html">D-Day anniversary: Commemorating the Second World War and preparing the Third</a>, World Socialist Web Site)</p>
<p>This is an important point and one that could put a swift end to US aggression in Ukraine. Washington’s objectives are at cross-purposes with those of the EU. The EU needs a reliable source of energy and one, like Russia, that will set its prices competitively without resorting to coercion or blackmail. Washington, on the other hand, intends to situate itself in this century’s most prosperous region, Eurasia, in order to control the flow of oil from East to West. This is not in Europe’s interests, but promises to be a source of conflict for the foreseeable future. Case in point: Just last week Bulgaria’s prime minister, Plamen Oresharski, “ordered a halt to work on Russia’s South Stream pipeline, on the recommendation of the EU. The decision was announced after his talks with US senators.”</p>
<p>According to RT News, Oresharski stopped construction after meeting with John McCain, Chris Murphy and Ron Johnson during their visit to Bulgaria on Sunday.</p>
<p>McCain, commenting on the situation, said that “Bulgaria should solve the South Stream problems in collaboration with European colleagues,” adding that in the current situation they would want “less Russian involvement” in the project.</p>
<p>“America has decided that it wants to put itself in a position where it excludes anybody it doesn’t like from countries where it thinks it might have an interest, and there is no economic rationality in this at all. Europeans are very pragmatic, they are looking for cheap energy resources – clean energy resources, and Russia can supply that. But the thing with the South Stream is that it doesn’t fit with the politics of the situation,” Ben Aris, editor of Business New Europe told RT.” (<a href="http://rt.com/business/164588-brussels-bulgaria-halts-south-stream/">Bulgaria halts Russia’s South Stream gas pipeline project</a>, RT)</p>
<p>Once again, we can see how US meddling is damaging to Europe’s interests.</p>
<p>Western elites want to control the flow of gas and oil from East to West. This is why they’ve installed their puppet in Kiev, threatened to levy more sanctions on Moscow, and moved B-2 stealth bombers into the European theater. They are determined to succeed in their plan even if it triggers a Third World War.</p>

<p>After two mystical encounters with the evil spirit Zarathustra, the dark prophet Nietzsche announced the &#8220;<em>death of the Christian God.&#8221;</em> Dubbing himself the Antichrist, Nietzsche proclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The greatest recent event — that &#8216;God is dead,&#8217; that the belief in the Christian God has ceased to be believable — is even now beginning to cast its first shadows over Europe; however, few really understood &#8221; what has really happened here, &#8220;and what must collapse now that this belief has been undermined — all that was built upon it, leaned on it, grew into it; for example, our whole European morality</em>.&#8221; (False Dawn, Lee Penn, p. 433)</p>
<p>From the beginning of Christ’s earthly ministry, there were those who received Him but many more, like Nietzsche, who would not, and so it will be until the end.   The former are those who admit and humbly confess their sinful condition while the latter, being full of stubborn pride, covetousness, and envy will not.</p>
<p>Not even the mighty miracle of creation ex nihilo as described in John’s Gospel and Christ’s own bodily resurrection (Luke 16:31) can persuade those who choose not to believe.</p>
<p>This willful unbelief in Christ had been prophesied long before.  In support of this John cites Isaiah 53:1-3,</p>
<p>“<em>He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem</em>.”</p>
<p>In order to be received, one must be acceptable.  Christ is rejected by proud, rebellious, sinless men along with His offer of salvation because He is not acceptable to them.  Thus their final word to Him is the cross.</p>
<p>At the root of the rejection of Jesus Christ God incarnate is the rebellious assertion that man has not been created by Him.  He is a free spirit neither dependent upon Him for his life nor created in His spiritual image but rather a conscious product of evolution.  He is a man-god who can choose either to murder God or to invent sock-puppet deities to do his bidding, for he is the master of science, evolution, matter, energy, time, and being who through his own knowledge and powers will save himself, or so he foolishly believes.  In reality, an inner blinding prevents him from ‘<em>seeing</em>’ that his liberty does not lead to greater freedom but to slavery because willful rejection of his Creator means he becomes Satan’s infernal tool.</p>
<p>“<strong>I am become a monstrous machine of annihilation</strong>…”  Ritual of Destruction, the Satanic Bible, Anton LeVey</p>
<p>The ritual ‘murder’ of the Christian God led to the collapse of far more than just European morality.  Consider the following:</p>
<p>In Christian thought, a person is a spirit and personality is the total individuality of the spirit. Without spirit there is no person.  The term &#8216;person&#8217; originated in Christian theologies developmental struggle to comprehend the nature and experience of the Christian God, the transcendent, personal Triune God:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The derivative concept of human personhood is a gift of the Christian faith to culture</em>…” (Stephen P. Stratton, Chapter 14, p. 247, The Self, Paul Vitz &amp; Susan M. Felch, Editors)</p>
<p>Whether the Founders were individually Christian or not, there was among them a strong Christian consensus that finds some of its greatest spiritual and moral expression in the scholarly works of Samuel Rutherford in “Lex Rex” (1644) and in the writings of the 18th century jurist William Blackstone.</p>
<p>Rutherford reasoned that since all people are sinners, then no sinner&#8212;whether President, Att. General, Senator, ‘gay,’ pastor, cop, jurist, perverse sex-educator, abortionist, evolutionary biologist, or Supreme Court Justice for example&#8212;is superior to any other sinner. No sinner is above the law but rather subject to the law without exception.  All must recognize that they are sinners under the unchanging transcendent Law of God.</p>
<p>Blackstone greatly influenced early American understanding of the Christian God, the Bible, Law and nature. He taught that since the eternally unchanging Triune God is the omnipotent Creator who works and governs the affairs of men then all law should be consistent with His Revelation in the Bible. No law should be passed that is contrary to the higher law of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as all men are created spiritual equals in the eyes of God, then life, property, worth, dignity and other unalienable rights are conferred upon each human person at conception.   For example, the unalienable right to life is because all people are God’s spiritual image bearers while freedom of religion and speech are the temporal property of a person’s God-given spiritual property of conscience and reason.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Property</em>,&#8221; published in The National Gazette on March 29, 1792, James Madison outlines the meaning of a person’s God-given spiritual property, some of its’ temporal rights and the meaning and intent of just government as opposed to unjust government:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>He has a property&#8230;.in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them.&#8221;  &#8220;He has a property&#8230;in his opinions and the free communication of them.&#8221;  &#8220;He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them.&#8221; &#8220;He has property very dear to him in the safety and liberty of his person.&#8221;</em>  (The Heritage Foundation)</p>
<p>Property is,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.<em>a man&#8217;s land, or merchandize, or money</em> (and) <em>as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights. Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties or his possessions.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Just government is instituted to protect property of every sort:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>This being the end of government, that alone is a just government, which impartially secures to every man, whatever is his own</em>.&#8221; (Samuel Rutherford, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flexrex.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO1sCexTm3r93UBFOA6aF4uQ1WIA">lexrex.com</a>)</p>
<p>The Constitution therefore, recognizes the divine nature of man&#8217;s creation, that man is a person endowed by his personal Creator with spiritual property, a divine right to life and liberty, and the means of acquiring and possessing property. Hence our Republic recognizes Law is unchangeable because the Creator (John 1:1) is the unchanging Lawgiver Who is the same today as yesterday and for all eternity:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>It is sufficiently obvious, that persons and property are the two great subjects on which Governments are to act; and that the rights of persons, and the rights of property, are the objects, for the protection of which Government was instituted. These rights cannot well be separated</em>.&#8221; (James Madison, Speech at the Virginia Convention, December 2, 1829)</p>
<p>Vishal Mangalwadi, India&#8217;s foremost Christian scholar affirms that the Christian gift of personhood gave birth to the &#8220;<em>belief in the unique dignity of human beings,&#8221; </em>and this is,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>the force that created Western civilization, where citizens do not exist for the state but the state exists for the individuals. Even kings, presidents, prime ministers, and army generals cannot be allowed to trample upon an individual and his or her rights</em>.&#8221; (Truth and Transformation: A Manifesto for Ailing Nations, pp. 12-13)</p>
<p><strong> Death of the Christian God: Catastrophic Consequences</strong></p>
<p><strong>“</strong><em>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.”</em> John 3:19</p>
<p>Once the citadel of the Light that came into the world, modern Western Europe and America are roiling seas of darkness punctuated here and there by shrinking islands of light because evil-minded men love darkness rather than Light. Thus the perversely twisted, upside-down, lawless atmosphere of our age is the &#8220;<em>death of the Christian God&#8221; </em>made tangible.</p>
<p>When people fall away from the knowledge of God and transgress against His commandments, these actions effectively turn them back to their natural state. This means that in forsaking God, the fount of living waters, they have become cracked cisterns that hold no water. (Jer. 2:13) In other words, the death of the Christian God logically means the death of spirit (person), hence also spiritual and temporal property, and by extension the collapse of Western civilization and America’s Constitutional Republic&#8212; “<em>if the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?”</em>  Psalm 11:3<br />
The methodology of the ‘murder’ of Christ the Creator (John 1:1) requires that the miracle of six day creation (Genesis account) together with Adam and Eve and their fall be de-historicized and reduced to myth and fable (annihilated), a project already underway by the time of Descartes and fulfilled with infernal ‘higher criticism.’</p>
<p>In her book &#8220;<em>Total Truth</em>,&#8221; Nancy Pearcy, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, writes that one of the great ironies of history is that the enduring impact of Descartes philosophy has been precisely the opposite of what he had intended. Descartes had intended the defense of the human soul/spirit over and against the dehumanizing mechanistic and materialistic conception of the universe. Instead, soul/spirit was reduced to a shadowy substance totally irrelevant to the material realm known by natural science. The immortal soul/spirit became a kind of ghost only tenuously connected to the physical body.</p>
<p>After the success of Newtonian physics natural science began to take on the trappings of religion. Epistemologically, science began to be viewed as the way to true understanding, and by extension, true progress. Nature itself took on the guise of an impersonal, mystical entity described as a cosmic machine governed by deterministic energies working through natural laws as strictly as the gears of a clock. Though soul/ spirit are crucial for reason, conscience, morality, belief, faith, prayer, theorizing, science, math and religion, there was no room for them in the cosmic machine.</p>
<p>The mechanistic conception gave rise to evil ‘isms’&#8211;rationalism, positivism, skepticism, relativism, and scientific materialism (atheism), which granted the sovereign reason of sinful man and naturalistic science an epistemological monopoly on so-called &#8220;real&#8221; knowledge, facts and truth while trivializing everything else to faith, personal belief and social constructs.  The devilish consequences of this have been horrendous, for whereas the creation of universal moral law was traditionally the function of the Triune God, now this function is arrogated to the individual human will, making the &#8220;reason&#8221; of sinners into God and science into a dictatorship of the knowable.</p>
<p>“…<strong>men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil</strong>.” John 3:19</p>
<p>With &#8220;reason&#8221; sitting on the throne of the Christian God, heaven was shut-down and the physical world of the senses elevated to the supreme reality. The six day Genesis account was de-historicized and replaced with imaginative evolutionary cosmologies claiming vast ages of time.  As supernatural Christian theism declined, immutable truth, moral law and sin disappeared under the onslaught of evil “isms” and apostate Protestant Liberalism (pantheism) in tandem with reductionist evolutionary biology, which became the most prestigious way to study the depersonalized human organism. With knowledge limited to the sensory realm, Jesus Christ the Word Incarnate was “murdered,” meaning reduced by evil men to an immanent mystical evolutionary force (Christ consciousness) while man’s soul/spirit was lost in an endless cycle of reductionism and determinism. Man, the person created in the spiritual likeness of the One God in three Persons would be lost.  In his place would stand the subhuman hominid, a conscious product of evolution, the god of forces.</p>
<p>Today, the ‘god’ evolution has so thoroughly replaced the living Word (John 1:1) and Special Creation in the consciousness of vast numbers of scientifically endarkened men and women within and without the whole body of the Christian Church that one of the leading evolution-worshippers of our day, Professor S.J. Gould, describes scientism and evolution as the story of mankind that tells us,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>where we came from, how we got here, and perhaps where we are going. Quite simply, it is science’s version of Roots, except it is the story of us all</em>.”   (The Religious Nature of Evolution Theory and its Attack on Christianity, John G. Leslie and Charles K. Pallaghy, Ph.D, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>)</p>
<p>In glowing affirmation, Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) , a prominent evolutionary biologist and progressive creationist sees the ‘god’ evolution as a light that illuminates all facts, a trajectory which all lines of thought must follow, for if man,</p>
<p>“&#8230;<em>has arrived at his present state as a result of natural processes rather than a supernatural will, he can learn to control these processes…The concept of evolution, which is now basic to the life sciences, has provided new and in some ways revolutionary answers to questions men have been asking for centuries. The two most important of these are, ‘Why am I here, what is the purpose of human existence, and what is the nature of the world of life that surrounds us?”   </em>(Dobzhansky, T., Ayala, F.J., Stebbins, G.L. and Valentine, J.W., Evolution, W.H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, 1977)</p>
<p><strong>Triumph of Scientism and the ‘god’ Evolution</strong></p>
<p>At its founding and for about 150 years after America was the world’s beacon of freedom and hope because it was founded on the true Light of unchanging truths such as,</p>
<p>“<em>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8211;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. .</em> .”</p>
<p>Now however, an endarkened generation of law makers, politicians, entertainers, professors, seminarians and high school graduates no longer believe that anyone knows ‘the’ truth or even if whether males are meant to be males or females too. For them, anyone who claims to know the truth is a bigoted fundamentalist because they know there was never a fall from God’s good creation but rather an evolutionary ascent moving from primordial matter to creeping things, crawling things, knuckle-dragging things to man. They know with certainty that human beings were never created but evolved. And as the ‘god’ evolution endows nothing&#8212;not soul/spirit, personhood, unalienable rights and the freedom to exercise them&#8212;then our Constitution is as meaningless as Xmas and Special Creation.</p>
<p>The real source of this evil and madness is a godless left-right confederacy of nihilists described by Professor Angelo Codevilla as America’s Ruling Class.  In “<em>The Ruling Class: How They Corrupted America and What We Can Do About It,”  </em>Codevilla, emeritus professor of international relations at Boston University, argues that America’s real war is between Americans who still worship the supernatural Triune God and a class of evolutionary humanists who dominate both political parties, academe, Hollywood, science and media.  They preach from pulpits, run big business, our economy and the country&#8217;s major institutions and imagine themselves entitled to reshape an America that they regard as composed of un-evolved subhuman hominids.</p>
<p>The Ruling Class affirm that scientism and evolution trump the Revelation of God, and as they are the evolved products of the &#8216;god&#8217; evolution they are science’s authoritative enlightened priests and god-men who pray to themselves,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; <em>as saviors of the planet and as shapers of mankind in their own image</em>..&#8221; (The Ruling Class: How They Corrupted America and What We Can Do About It, p. xix)<br />
After more than eighty years of nearly unopposed evolutionary evangelization in the schools, media, seminaries, academia and elsewhere the Ruling Class is finally at liberty to declare that evolution is “mind,”</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>….enlarging its domain up the chain of species.&#8221;  </em>The god evolution is the <em>“universe&#8230;a mind that oversees, orchestrates, and gives order and structure to all things</em>.&#8221;   (Algeny, Jeremy Rifkin, 1983, p. 188)</p>
<p>Now that scientism and evolution reign supreme, Satan’s infernal machines, such as the demonized Rifkin,  no longer feel like guests,</p>
<p>”&#8230;..<em> in someone else&#8217;s home and therefore obliged to make our behavior conform with a set of pre-existing cosmic rules. It is our creation now. We make the rules. We establish the parameters of reality. We create the world, and because we do, we no longer feel beholden to outside forces. We no longer have to justify our behavior, for we are now the architects of the universe. We are responsible to nothing outside ourselves for we are the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever</em>.” (ibid)</p>
<p>According to Robert Muller, the father of World Core Curriculum, now that evolution is “mind” highly evolved men are free to spiritually evolve into higher and higher forms, to become one with the ‘divine:’</p>
<p>“<em>Once again, but this time on a universal scale, humankind is seeking no less than its reunion with the ‘divine,’ its transcendence into ever higher forms of life.  Hindus call our earth Brahma, or God, for they rightly see no difference between our earth and the divine.  This ancient simple truth is slowly dawning again upon humanity.  Its full flowering will be the real, great new story of humanity as we are about to enter our cosmic age&#8230;” </em>(New Genesis: Shaping a Global Spirituality, Robert Muller, father of Core Curriculum, 1984, p. 84)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..<strong>the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one.&#8221;  </strong>1 John 5:19<strong>    &#8220;Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.&#8221;</strong>  Luke 11:35</p>
<p>From the post-flood world of ancient Babylon to our own, the majority of the world&#8217;s people have lived under the tyranny of powers, principalities and various determinisms&#8212;karma, reincarnation, evolution, fates, furies, chance, cause, doom, natural selection, and genes. They believed that all events in the real world were predestined and controlled by unseen forces of the cosmos that the apostle Paul described as the elemental spirits of the universe.</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ God incarnate demonstrated His absolute control over the elements (Luke 8:24) the tyranny of determinism was cast down and utterly broken.  In the fourth century Gregory of Nazianzen suggested that at the very moment when the Magi came to worship the child of Mary and Joseph, it was then that the tyranny of determinism was broken:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;From that moment onward, the cosmos has orbited around the newborn king&#8230;Christ is the logos&#8212;the word and the reason by whom all exists and to whom all is ordered</em>.&#8221; (American Babylon, Neuhaus, p. 226)<br />
Determinism crept into the West when evil spirits entered into the heart of Christendom during the Renaissance.   They came quietly, first to certain theologians who rejected Jesus Christ in favor of Hermetic magic, Babylonian Kabala, Eastern mysticism, reincarnation, evolution, karma and other occult traditions and determinisms, and then openly with the brazen claim that laws of matter and evolution ultimately govern the world and man.</p>
<p>With penetrating insight, Father Richard John Neuhaus connects modern evolutionary scientism to its&#8217; ancient spiritual foundations in astrology. In his book, &#8220;<em>American Babylon</em>,&#8221; Neuhaus argues that astrological elemental spirits have been recast as,</p>
<p>&#8220;…<em>evolutionary dynamics, life forces, or laws of nature.&#8221;  Though described as laws rather than spirits, these elemental &#8220;forces”…. work their inexorable ways in cold indifference to reason, to will, to love, and to hope. In short, it is suggested that the elemental spirits are in charge and that human freedom is a delusion.</em>&#8220;(p. 226)</p>
<p>“<strong>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.”</strong>  Colossians 2:8</p>
<p>According to Pastor Larry DeBruyn, the word &#8220;<em>rudiments&#8221;</em> (Greek, stoicheion) relates to the universe of matter and energy and is variously,</p>
<p><em>“…. translated “elemental powers” (NAB), “elementary principles” (NASB), “basic principles” (NIV, NKJV), “evil powers” (NLT), and “elemental spirits” (ESV, NRSV). Translations indicate that stoicheion’s meaning diverges between “principles” and “powers,” between the “physical elements” constitutive of the cosmos or universe, or the “spiritual powers” that inhabit it. In 2 Peter 3:10, the first sense—that is, the “elements” which “shall melt with fervent heat”—is evident, while in Galatians 4:3 and 9, the other sense—that is, “world forces” which once “held in bondage” the Galatian believers—is evident.&#8221;</em> (The Supreme Supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ,<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fguardinghisflock.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJMBqN8eF8dZg-IRvA0zfKH7BGHw">guardinghisflock.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The Worldview of Evil Spirits</strong></p>
<p>“….<em>we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”</em>  Eph. 6:12</p>
<p>During the 1970s Satanism and possession became front page news in America.  It was during this time that the eminent theologian Malachi Martin, a former Jesuit professor at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome published his shattering book on demon oppression and possession.<br />
Martin&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Hostage to the Devil</em>: <em>the Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans</em>,&#8221; presents five cases of actual possession that express important aspects of the worldview of evil spirits which allow us to not only identify these elements but discern their devastating effects within the whole body of the Christian church, the minds of millions of Americans and by extension, our nation.</p>
<p>The worldview of evil powers always takes the form of nature worship, or celebration of created things such as matter and energy as opposed to worship of the living, personal Creator Who created everything. Thus in support of the idea that living beings created themselves it is virulently anti-supernatural and Genesis account creation ex nihilo in favor of one dimensional naturalism and evolutionary cosmologies.</p>
<p>In one case, an evil spirit’s evolutionary cosmology teaching the self-created &#8220;universe of matter&#8221; and human life was disclosed wherein,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>men, women, animals, plants, cities, oceans </em>(are) <em>interconnected.  There is really no difference between one thing and anything else&#8230;.land, ocean, animals, humans, plants are one living organism clad in the shell of breathable atmosphere.  Psychic forces bind it all together&#8230;.It is a self-creating, self-protecting, self-developing thing&#8230;..Earth as mother, as womb, as god, as tomb, as a whole unity protected by its own shell and its own strength (is) all there is.&#8221; </em>(p. 395)</p>
<p>From the Big Bang (exploding cosmic egg) which supposedly created matter and energy in the demon&#8217;s description of the universe as &#8220;self-creating&#8221; to inflationary in the description of the universe as a &#8220;self-developing thing&#8221; to Gaia as &#8220;Earth as self-protecting mother&#8221; the possessing demon’s evolutionary cosmology is very similar to occult New Age spirituality.</p>
<p>Another important case involved David, a Catholic priest who became obsessed with the evolutionary scientism of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.  Teilhard’s destructive influence is widespread today within transnational Trans-humanist circles, the U.N., the Catholic Church, and increasingly within the Protestant Church.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Teilhard de Chardin: Trojan Horse of Vatican II/Heretic Extraordinaire</em>,&#8221; Dr. J. P. Hubert wonders whether based on Teilhard’s admission of a mystical encounter if his evolutionary science was satanically inspired.  Teilhard describes his strange encounter:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The man was walking in the desert&#8230;when the Thing swooped down on him.  Then, suddenly, a breath of scorching air passed across his forehead, broke through the barrier of his closed eyelids; an irresistible rapture took possession of him&#8230;.mightily refashioning the enfeebled fibres of his being.  And at the same time the anguish of some superhuman peril oppressed him, a confused feeling that the force which had swept down upon him was equivocal, turbid, the combined essence of all evil and goodness.  You called me: here I am grown weary of abstractions, of attenuations, of the wordiness of social life, you wanted to pit yourself against Reality entire and untamed.  I was waiting for you in order to be made holy.  And now I am established on you for life, or for death&#8230;.He who has once seen me can never forget me: he must either damn himself with me or save me with himself.  O you who are divine and mighty, what is your name? Speak</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hubert concludes that Teilhardism is,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;no doubt of Satanic origin&#8212;a true &#8220;religion of man,&#8221; if ever there was one</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>America’s Unfolding Spiritual Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>For over eighty-five years, America has been incrementally conquered by the same madness-inducing demon of hatred and violence that earlier took over Russia, China, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>This demon is mainly embodied within America&#8217;s &#8220;scientifically endarkened&#8221; Ruling Class which is deeply oppressed and possessed by elemental spirits and the delusion that the true enemy of America is always on the Right.  Having rejected the biblical God and the religious heritage of our civilization, they embrace instead an ancient order of beliefs of which Communism and Socialism are logical expressions.  A new world order is what they seek, but in order that it can emerge, the still remaining remnants of America&#8217;s Christian-based culture must be completely destroyed.<br />
What this means is that the spiritual catastrophe that unfolded in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany is unfolding on America’s stage.</p>
<p>Can this catastrophe be averted?</p>
<p><strong>Repentance: The Only Way Back</strong></p>
<p>Returning to David, prior to his obsession with Teilhardism he was destined to become a professor of anthropology at a Catholic university.  But under the influence of Teilhardism, he came to see that the Genesis account of creation ex nihilo, Adam and Eve as the first man and woman and parents of all mankind who fell and passed on Original Sin to all human beings were utterly contrary to modern scientific thinking and evolution.</p>
<p>Therefore David taught anthropology from a modern “evolutionary science&#8221; perspective, even going so far as to exclude traditional presentations of doctrines about creation ex nihilo and Original Sin.  But after introducing Teilhardism to his students, doubts arose when he observed the breathtaking transformative effects of this teaching upon Jonathan, one of his students, a priest who now insisted that <em>all the sacraments </em><em>are “…no more than expressions of man&#8217;s natural unity with the world around him.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>David’s eyes were suddenly opened and he saw clearly for the first time that Teilhardism exalted man as an animal and pictured,</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>God as no more than the very bowels of earth and sky and the spatial distances of the universe with all its expanding galaxies</em>.&#8221; (Martin, p. 107)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jonathan left the church and quickly founded his own cult among wealthy Manhattan families.  He preached that the universe and all people were evolving as ‘one’ in a naturally occurring mystical union which he called &#8220;<em>Abba Father</em>.&#8221; (p. 127)</p>
<p>Martin writes that Jonathan had come under the dominion of an evil spirit and David was called in to exorcise him.  However, the demon possessing Jonathan ridiculed David, saying they both believed the same things, therefore if Jonathan needed exorcism David needed it more.</p>
<p>Reeling in shock, David was led to an agony of soul-searching over the course of many weeks during which he re-examined and finally repented of the intellectual arrogance that led him to embrace Teilhardism and the &#8220;higher criticism&#8221; of Scriptures that reduced the Revealed Word to myth, allegory and delusion and the death of Jesus to an insignificant event of the evolutionary past rather than,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…an ever present source of personal forgiveness and unshakable hope for any future</em>.&#8221; (p. 149)</p>
<p>According to Martin, the evil spirit who had nearly succeeded in killing David’s faith now taunted him that to return to faith would entail slavery of mind and will.   But when a repentant David deliberately rejected the demon&#8217;s taunts,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;a great and breathtaking dimension full of relief&#8230;.flooded his mind and will and imagination&#8230;.And when he now looked at the world of nature around him&#8230;and heard the song of a mockingbird nearby, he received it no longer as he had while a Teilhardian evolutionist, as &#8216;intimations of molecules endlessly regrouping,&#8217; but rather &#8216;of endless life for each person, and of love without a shadow.</em>&#8221; (pp. 163, 165)</p>
<p>Speaking through Nietzsche, Zarathustra had declared the death of the Christian God on behalf of all willful unbelievers, but now for David, “<em>He’s alive and I’m forgiven</em>!”   His faith in God, Christ, the Holy Spirit and Scripture restored, David was ready to exorcise the evil spirit who possessed Jonathan.  He did so,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;in the name of God who created him</em> (Jonathan) <em>and you</em> (evil spirit), <em>and of Jesus of Nazareth who saved him!  You will depart and get back to the uncleanness and agony you chose.&#8221;</em> (p. 169)</p>

</div>
<p>Turkey seems fond of so-called ‘false flag’ operations.  In 1955, for example, the Turkish government <a name="0.1__Hlt389423584"></a><a name="0.1__Hlt389423585"></a><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SdubdhMwM1YC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=1955+turkish+thessaloniki+september+5&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O7NHJneGjC&amp;sig=ajqdcxRUjGySQOuzaDDtZVTv1v8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EduLU5GdDaeqsQSB7oCoAg&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1955%20turkish%20thessaloniki%20september%205&amp;f=false" target="_blank">covertly</a> bombed its own consulate in Thessaloniki, Greece and blamed it on Greeks.  The following day, Turkey stage-managed massive anti-Greek <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_pogrom" target="_blank">riots</a> in Istanbul that killed over a dozen Christians and caused hundreds of millions in damage.</p>
<p>Fast forward to March 2014.   A leaked audiotape caught Turkish officials <a href="http://www.whiteoutpress.com/articles/2014/q1/leaked-recording-shows-turkey-to-attack-itself-blame-syria/" target="_blank">plotting</a> to stage ‘false flag’ military attacks on their own territory and blame them on Syrians.   Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, General Yaşar Gürel, and Intelligence chief Hakan Fidan planned to use the attacks as an excuse to invade Syria.   The title of this article could easily apply to that plot.</p>
<p>To close observers of the Caucasus, however, it could also describe a failed covert Turkish plan to attack Armenia two decades ago and turn the geopolitics of the region upside down.</p>
<p>In October 1993, two years after the USSR had splintered, an ethnic Chechen Muslim named Ruslan Khasbulatov – the Speaker, believe it or not, of the Russian Parliament – led a <a name="0.1__Hlt389508423"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Russian_constitutional_crisis" target="_blank">coup</a> against beleaguered Russian President Boris Yeltsin.  According to American, French, and Greek officials, Khasbulatov and Muslim Turkey had a secret agreement.</p>
<p>If his coup succeeded, Khasbulatov would order Russian troops to withdraw from Armenia, where they helped guard the latter’s border with Turkey.   That would pave the way for Turkey to invade the landlocked Christian nation of just three million inhabitants.</p>
<p>History tells us that Turkey has always wanted to overrun Armenia.   Doing so would create a path to Turkic-speaking Muslim Azerbaijan, the Caspian Sea, and, eventually, Central Asia.  It’s called pan-Turkism.</p>
<div>
<img src="http://www.thetotalcollapse.com/wp-content/uploads/Caucasus_Map.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>In 1993, of course, Azerbaijan was losing its war with Armenians over the ancient, majority-Armenian province of <a href="https://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/karabagh.html" target="_blank">Karabagh</a>.   Azerbaijan was, therefore, eager for Turkey to attack Armenia, and Turkey was ready to help Azerbaijan turn the tide.</p>
<p><strong>The Plot Fails</strong></p>
<p>Harkening back to the Armenian genocide, Turkish President Turgut Özal had <a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/centers/armenian/source106.html" target="_blank">threatened</a> to teach Armenia “the lessons of 1915.”  Tansu Çiller, Turkey’s prime minister, <a href="http://www.armenianow.com/news/politics/32122/turkey_armenia_azerbaijan_karabakh_war" target="_blank">warned</a> Armenia that she wouldn’t “sit back and do nothing.”  Turkey was massing forces on Armenia’s western border and <a href="http://armenianhouse.org/demoyan/turkey/index.html" target="_blank">supplying</a> Azerbaijan with weapons, military advisors, and paramilitary forces.  Chechen militants and Afghan Mujahideen were already fighting alongside Azeris.</p>
<p>A successful Turkish attack on Armenia – Russia’s only military partner in the Caucasus – would have all but destroyed Russian influence in the region.  That, in turn, would have increased the likelihood that Chechnya, and much of the Muslim North Caucasus, would eventually escape the Russian Bear’s grip.  For a native-born Chechen like Khasbulatov, it would all be a dream-come-true.</p>
<p>But bombarded by Russian tanks, Speaker Khasbulatov, V.P. Alexander Rutskoi, and hundreds of rebel parliamentarians and supporters <a href="http://rt.com/news/parliament-siege-yeltsin-timeline-691/" target="_blank">surrendered</a> the Parliament building on October 4, 1993.  The coup and the plot to invade Armenia had failed.</p>
<p><strong>The Secret Pact</strong></p>
<p>The Khasbulatov-Turkish pact was first revealed by Leonidas T. Chrysanthopoulos in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Caucasus-Chronicles-Nation-Building-Diplomacy-1993-1994/dp/1884630057" target="_blank">Caucasus Chronicles</a> (London:  Gomidas, 2002).   He was Greece’s ambassador to Armenia from July 1993 to February 1994.   Chrysanthopoulos, now 68, has served as ambassador to Canada and Poland, and was recently Secretary General of the 12-country, Istanbul-based Black Sea Economic Cooperation organization.</p>
<p>France’s ambassador to Armenia, Mme. France de Harthing, told him that “French intelligence sources” confirmed that “the Turkish incursion into Armenia would take place immediately after Khasbulatov would have withdrawn the Russian troops from Armenia.”   “This information,” wrote Chrysanthopoulos, “was later confirmed to me by my United States colleague,” Ambassador Harry J. Gilmore.</p>
<p>As a “pretext,” Turkey would claim to be targeting Kurdish PKK militant bases, which in fact have never existed, in Armenia.  Such a “pretext” is similar, though not identical, to a ‘false flag.’</p>
<p>The Turkish strike would be “incursions of a limited nature,” though it’s unclear what “limited” meant.  More likely, as Turkey wouldn’t find any PKK, the aim was to forge a permanent corridor across Armenia, link up with Azeri forces, and cleanse Karabagh of Armenians.</p>
<p>The U.S. and France have never, as far as is known, publicly denied the existence of the Khasbulatov-Turkish plot.  Moreover, Chrysanthopoulos gives no indication that any country tried to talk Turkey out of its deal with Khasbulatov.</p>
<p>Is any of this relevant today?</p>
<p><strong>NATO Ambitions</strong></p>
<p>Yes, because current Turkish, American, and NATO policies in the Caucasus strongly echo the 1993 Khasbulatov-Turkish plot.  For two decades, the West has been trying to penetrate and dominate the Caucasus – Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia –and eventually cross the Caspian Sea into energy-rich Central Asia.</p>
<p>One piece of the plan has already been partially implemented: constructing oil and gas pipelines from Azerbaijan through Georgia and Turkey.</p>
<p>NATO’s remaining goal: absorb the entire Caucasus.  NATO would thereby threaten Russia from the south, just as it now pressures Russia from the west with its absorption of much of Eastern Europe (and, NATO hopes, Ukraine).</p>
<p>Georgia and Azerbaijan are inclined to eventually join NATO.   Armenia, however, is not, though it has excellent relations with NATO and the West.  Armenia has little choice but to ally itself with Russia because the former faces an ongoing existential threat from NATO member Turkey, the 1993 plot being one example.</p>
<p>Armenia is the Caucasus&#8217;s linchpin.  Had the Khasbulatov &#8211; Turkish quasi-‘false flag’ operation against Armenia succeeded, Russia would probably have lost, and NATO would have gained, the entire Caucasus.   New provocations, including ‘false flags,’ by Turkey and NATO cannot, therefore, be ruled out.</p>
<p>Turkish, American, and NATO leaders must also be interrogated as to whether their policies in the Caucasus are leading to peace or war.</p>

<p><strong><em>“Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge, which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible…” </em><em>– George Orwell, 1984</em></strong></p>
<p>Nations, cultures and populations are best controlled through the use of false paradigms. This is a historically proven tactic exploited for centuries by oligarchs around the world. Under the Hegelian dialectic (the very foundation of the Marxist and collectivist ideology), one could summarize the trap of false paradigms as follows:</p>
<p><em>If (A) my idea of freedom conflicts with (B) your idea of freedom, then (C) neither of us can be free until everyone agrees to be a slave.</em></p>
<p>In other words: problem, reaction, solution. Two sides are pitted against each other in an engineered contest. Each side is led to believe that its position is the good and right position. Neither side questions the legitimacy of the conflict, because each side fears this will lead to ideological weakness and disunity.</p>
<p>The two sides go to war, sometimes economically, sometimes militarily. Both governments demand that individuals relinquish freedom, independence and self-reliance, a sacrifice that “must be made” so that victory can be achieved. In the end, neither nation nor society has truly won. The only winners are the oligarchs, who sing words of loyalty to their respective camps, while acting in league from the very beginning. The oligarchs, who never intended to target each other in the first place. Their target, their ONLY target, was the citizenry itself — the dumbfounded masses now mesmerized with shock, awe and terror.</p>
<p>The false paradigm method and the Hegelian dialectic are in full force today. Only a few years ago, Russia, China and the United States were considered close economic and political allies. Today, those alliances are being quickly scrapped in order to make room for conflict, a conflict useful only to a select international elite. As I have outlined in numerous articles, including<em><a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2074-russia-is-dominated-by-global-banks-too">Russia Is Dominated By Global Banks, Too</a> </em>and <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2126-false-eastwest-paradigm-hides-the-rise-of-global-currency"><em>False East/West Paradigm Hides The Rise Of Global Currency</em></a>, when one looks beyond all the theatrical rhetoric being thrown around between Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, the ultimate reality is that the relationship of both governments to the global banking elite is the same.</p>
<p>During both of Obama’s Presidential terms, he has flooded his cabinet with current and former<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.whiteoutpress.com/articles/q42012/list-of-goldman-sachs-employees-in-the-white-house/" target="_blank">employees of Goldman Sachs</a>, a longtime proving ground for elitist financiers with globalist aspirations.</p>
<p>And who is the primary economic adviser to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state? Why<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-05/goldman-sachs-hired-by-russia-as-corporate-broker-to-boost-image.html" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a>, of course!</p>
<p>U.S. and European elites have been calling for a centralization of economic power under the control of the International Monetary Fund, as a well as a new <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2011/0214/297662-g20/" target="_blank">global currency</a>.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Putin also wants a new <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html" target="_blank">global currency</a> under the control of the IMF.</p>
<p>Obama is closely advised by globalists like Zbigniew Brzezinski, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and cofounder of the Trilateral Commission, who in his book <em>Between Two Ages: America’s Role In The Technetronic Era</em> states:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;The nation-state is gradually yielding its sovereignty …[F]urther progress will require greater American sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the present relatively favorable American position…&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>As long as he has been in power, Putin has been closely advised by <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/world/europe/henry-kissinger-to-meet-with-vladimir-putin-in-russia.html?_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">Henry Kissinger</a>, yet another member of the CFR and proponent of the Trilateral Commission, who <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/henry-kissinger-the-world-must-forge-a-new-order-or-retreat-to-chaos-1451416.html" target="_blank">has said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;In the end, the political and economic systems can be harmonized in only one of two ways: by creating an international political regulatory system with the same reach as that of the economic world; or by shrinking the economic units to a size manageable by existing political structures, which is likely to lead to a new mercantilism, perhaps of regional units. A new Bretton Woods kind of global agreement is by far the preferable outcome…&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Both Kissinger and Brzezinski refer to this harmonized global economic and political structure as the “New World Order.” The fact that the political leaders of Russia and the United States are clearly being directed by such men should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>China, too, has made demands for a restructuring of the global monetary system into a<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7851925a-17a2-11de-8c9d-0000779fd2ac.html" target="_blank">centralized currency basket</a> under the dominance of the IMF.</p>
<p>China’s <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.thedailybell.com/news-analysis/35155/Directed-History-of-the-Citys-Alliance-with-China/" target="_blank">ties to the banking elite</a> of London are well documented.</p>
<p>The call on both sides for a new monetary system and the end of the dollar as world reserve seems to greatly contradict the fantasy that the East and West are fundamentally at odds.  The progression towards a world currency and/or economic governance also appears to be growing along with the consolidation of economic and military ties between Eastern nations. This would suggest that the rise of the East and the crippling of Western elements is actually advantageous to global bankers in the long term.</p>
<p>While disinformation agents and media shills have attempted to downplay any danger to the strength of America and the dollar, Eastern governments have been swiftly establishing alliances and decoupling from U.S. influence.</p>
<p>The historic 30-year <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/pikeresearch/2014/05/30/russia-china-gas-deal-narrows-window-for-u-s-exports/" target="_blank">Russia/China gas deal</a> has, of course, been finalized. This deal is already eating up market space and influencing the way in which the energy trade traditionally behaves.</p>
<p>China and Russia have also <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101705303">expanded on their bilateral agreements made in 2010</a>, which remove the dollar as the reserve currency in transactions between the two nations.</p>
<p>China’s thirst for gold continues, while the country is now building its own <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.metal.com/newscontent/61012_china-invites-top-foreign-banks-to-global-gold-exchange" target="_blank">gold exchange</a> to rival the U.S. Comex.</p>
<p>Russia has recently established what Putin calls the “Eurasian Economic Union,” a deal which includes Kazakhstan and Belarus, two countries that hold large, freshly discovered <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/29/us-ukraine-crisis-eurasia-idUSKBN0E90O520140529" target="_blank">oil fields</a>.</p>
<p>In response to the engineered conflict over Ukraine, as well as the “Asian-Pacific Pivot” by the U.S., China has openly called for a new <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-calls-for-new-security-pact-with-russia-iran/" target="_blank">security pact</a> with Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget that China is set to surpass the U.S. as the <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/china-business/9947825/China-to-overtake-America-by-2016.html" target="_blank">world’s largest economy</a> by 2016, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>While the rise of the East is being painted in Western circles as a threat to U.S. and NATO dominance, the bigger picture is being hidden from view. Yes, indeed, the consolidation of the East is a considerable threat to the dollar and the U.S. economy — most importantly in the event that China refuses to accept dollars as payment on exports and debts. With the world’s largest exporter/importer refusing to take dollars as a reserve, most nations will inevitably follow their lead.  The argument against this development is, of course, that there is no rational trigger for such a violent fiscal attack. I would remind skeptics that there was no rational trigger for the current strengthened relations between Russia and China until the Ukraine crisis. Is anyone really foolish enough to bet against another direct or indirect conflict between NATO and the East? And is anyone really ignorant enough to assume that said event would not be used as an excuse to cut the legs out from under the dollar completely?</p>
<p>The New World Order players have positioned the East and West for just such a scenario. Why? In my article <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2145-who-is-the-new-secret-buyer-of-us-debt"><em>Who Is The New Secret Buyer Of U.S. Debt?</em></a>, I give evidence indicating that the Bank of International Settlements and the IMF are preparing the financial world for a new global monetary system, brought into existence by a second Bretton Woods conference. The debasement of the dollar and the rise of the East are NOT obstacles to this plan.  Rather, they are required factors. There can be no truly global economic system without “harmonization”, the demise of the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status, and the end of sovereign economic governance.</p>
<p>For those who doubt this scenario, read Paul Volcker’s latest statement, as reported by <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-06-01/paul-volcker-proposes-new-breton-woods-system-prevent-frequent-destructive-financial" target="_blank">Zero Hedge</a>.</p>
<p>Volcker, the same man who was directly involved in the destruction of the first Bretton Woods agreement and the final death rattle of the gold standard, is now promoting a NEW Bretton Woods-style agreement in which currencies are pegged to a controlled market system — in essence, a centralized international monetary system. Volcker also suggests that a single nation-based reserve currency like the dollar may be a danger to overall fiscal health.</p>
<p>Volcker is right. The dollar-dominated forex casino and fiat fraud is a danger to the world. Volcker helped make it that way! And what a surprise, the former Federal Reserve chairman has a solution on a silver platter for the American people — all we need is GLOBALcentralization and bureaucratic oversight.</p>
<p>The propaganda is being carefully planted within the mainstream. Christine Lagarde of the IMF now spends the whole of her media interviews inserting the phrase “global economic reset” without explaining exactly what that would entail, while central banking elites like Volcker suggest a Bretton Woods II conference leading to a global monetary authority. In the meantime, Russian government-funded media outlets like RT produce pieces <a style="color: #006699;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvKucpTckjA">accusing the U.S. of being a nuclear menace</a> while we Americans get to watch manipulative Hollywood films like <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/JRshadowRecruit.html" target="_blank">“Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,”</a> which depicts a Russian plot to collapse the U.S. economy.  China and U.S. representatives <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0531/US-and-China-accuse-each-other-of-intimidation-and-coercion">squabble with each other at geopolitical meetings</a> fueling fears of diplomatic breakdown, while the Pentagon &#8220;suggests&#8221; they may have to revamp their military strategies in <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://news.yahoo.com/west-ponders-stop-fight-great-war-113159434.html">consideration of yet another World War</a>.  Just as in Orwell&#8217;s book, 1984, old enemies become allies and then enemies once again, and at the top of the pyramid, it&#8217;s all a farce.</p>
<p>The best lies contain elements of truth. The truth here is that the East is forming alliances in opposition to the West, the West is involved in underhanded covert operations all over the planet, and both “sides” are in fact on the verge of a catastrophic battle for supremacy. The great lie is that important details have been left out of our little story. Both sides are merely puppet pieces in a grand game of global chess, and any conflict will ultimately benefit the small group of men standing over the board. They include the international financiers who have influenced the very policy fabric of each government toward a climactic crisis which they hope will finally give them the “New World Order” they have always dreamed of.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama’s commencement address at West Point on May 28 managed to displease pretty much everyone in the nation’s commentariat. Before making an overall assessment of its significance, it is necessary to examine the validity and implications of Obama’s individual statements.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“[B]y most measures America has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world. Those who argue otherwise – who suggest that America is in decline or has seen its global leadership slip away – are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics.”</em></p>
<p>This key assertion, made at the beginning of the President’s address, does not stand to empirical scrutiny. In economic terms, America was <a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/newsletters13/images/52-3-fig4.gif" target="_blank">far stronger</a> vis-à-vis the rest of the world <a href="http://www.growth-dynamics.com/news/sep20_04_files/image004.gif" target="_blank">in 1945</a> than she is today. In more recent times, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_states" target="_blank">U.S. share of world GDP peaked in 1985 with just under 33 percent</a> of global GDP (nominal). Between 2004 and 2014, United States’ share of global gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/270267/united-states-share-of-global-gross-domestic-product-gdp" target="_blank">has fallen from 22.5 percent to 18.5 percent</a>, and it is expected to continue falling. By the end of this year <a href="http://blogs.piie.com/realtime/?p=4297" target="_blank">China will overtake the United States in gross domestic product</a>, which <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d79ffff8-cfb7-11e3-9b2b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz33nby4kyz" target="_blank">had originally been projected to happen</a> by the end of this decade. Analysts concede will gradually <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-economic-power-shifting-in-chinas-favor/2014/05/14/bee0d608-daf3-11e3-b745-87d39690c5c0_story.html" target="_blank">shift the ability to confer advantages or disadvantages on other countries</a> – in other words, power – in China’s favor.</p>
<p>In military terms, while America enjoyed the nuclear monopoly in 1945-49, her period of undisputed unipolar dominance was between 1991 (the collapse of the USSR) and 2008 (Russia’s counterattack in South Ossetia). Although the Pentagon budget will drop from $600 billion this year to $500 billion in 2015, it will continue to account for over a third of the global total. The unsatisfactory outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan and dented America’s image of military invincibility. As <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21601535-no-other-country-comes-close-americas-hard-power-its-lead-slipping-unrivalled" target="_blank">the Economist commented on May 3</a>, “The yawning gap between Uncle Sam and his potential foes seems bound to shrink.” The prevailing view among most critical analysts is that <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/decline-of-the-american-empire-global-configurations-of-power-the-swindle-economy-and-the-criminal-state/5359263" target="_blank">over the past decade the U.S. has suffered military reverses, and now faces severe global competition</a>.</p>
<p>As for the “global leadership,” it is unclear what exactly Obama had in mind. Russia and China are creating a powerful Eurasian counterweight to what they rightly perceive as Washington’s continuing bid for the global hegemony. <a href="https://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/modi-ante-portas" target="_blank">India’s new prime minister</a> is a potential partner at best, and certainly loath to acknowledge America’s “leadership.”  In the Islamic world, Obama’s attempts at appeasement – which started with the Cairo speech in 2009 – have not worked: The U.S. is now <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/15/us-obama-muslims-animosity-deepens" target="_blank">even more unpopular in the Muslim world</a> than it was under George W. Bush. America is heartily disliked even in Turkey and Jordan, presumably our allies, not least because of the continuing drone strikes. American influence in Latin America is weaker now than at any time since Theodore Roosevelt, as manifested in the unanimous rejection of Washington’s efforts to effect a regime change in Venezuela. Members of the American elite class are <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-05-20/opinion/ct-america-standing-overseas-europe-lipson-oped-05-20140520_1_john-kerry-achievement-balance-sheet" target="_blank">hard pressed to name a single country with which the U.S. has better relations today than five years ago</a>. The NSA global spying network has infuriated even some otherwise reliable American friends in Western Europe. Most “Old Europeans” are remarkably resistant to U.S. pressure to agree to serious sanctions against Russia.</p>
<p>On balance it appears that Barack Obama is the one misreading history and engaging in partisan politics.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“Meanwhile, our economy remains the most dynamic on Earth, our businesses the most innovative.”</em></p>
<p>In reality, by most value-neutral parameters the American economy is chronically weak and insolvent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Far from growing, the economy contracted in the first three months of this year at the annualized rate of one per cent, and it is unclear where future growth would come from. Gross domestic income is also <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=bwk" target="_blank">falling sharply, for the first time in years</a>.</li>
<li>There are fewer workers, they are less efficient than a decade ago, and new employment is mostly in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/05/24/temporary-jobs-on-rise-in-shifting-us-economy/9273921/" target="_blank">low-paying part-time jobs</a>. Labor force participation (the percentage of Americans at work) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/29/us-economy-growth-gdp-dip-recovery" target="_blank">is low, at levels not seen</a> since the stagnant economy of the 1970s. One-fifth of 80 million American families <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/famee.pdf" target="_blank">do not have a single employed member</a>.</li>
<li>Government dependence has <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/18-stats-that-prove-that-government-dependence-has-reached-epidemic-levels" target="_blank">reached epidemic levels</a>: the number of Americans getting money or benefits from the federal government exceeds the number of full-time workers in the private sector <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-real-unemployment-rate-in-20-of-american-families-everyone-is-unemployed" target="_blank">by more than 60 million</a>. Welfare spending and entitlement payments account for <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/18-stats-that-prove-that-government-dependence-has-reached-epidemic-levels" target="_blank">69 percent</a> of the federal budget.</li>
<li>One-third of all American households <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/25/news/economy/middle-class-paycheck/index.html?iid=hp_river" target="_blank">are living hand-to-mouth, one paycheck from poverty</a>. The median annual income is <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/median-household-income-update.php" target="_blank">7.5 percent lower than in January 2008</a>.</li>
<li>The inflation-adjusted S&amp;P500 is back to where it was in 2007. The single biggest buyer of stocks are the companies of the S&amp;P500 itself. At $4 trillion, stock buybacks account for one-fifth of the total stock market value. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-27/here-mystery-and-completely-indiscriminate-buyer-stocks-first-quarter" target="_blank">The biggest buyback in market history</a> added zero productive value to the companies concerned.</li>
<li>The mountain of debt <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/np/debt/current" target="_blank">is nearing $17.5 trillion</a>. The drivers of <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2014/05/14/2014-deficit-tells-doesnt-u-s-budget-gap" target="_blank">growing deficits and debt in the future</a> are unfunded entitlement programs <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2014/04/11/washington-post-op-ed-didnt-pay-shes-right/" target="_blank">that are designed to transfer</a> resources from working people to retirees. When the government pension and health care commitments which are missing from official budget figures are accounted for, <a href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/books/government-debt-iceberg.pdf" target="_blank">the total national debt is nearly $95 trillion</a>, more than seven times the published figure.</li>
<li>The dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency is almost over. Russia and China have joined forces in “de-dollarization” of their <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/20/russia-china-bankdeal.html" target="_blank">mutual transactions</a> and are looking for a more productive and safe use for their monetary reserves. Their recent gas deal is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/energysource/2014/05/29/the-colder-war-and-the-end-of-the-petrodollar" target="_blank">the beginning of the end for the petrodollar</a>. Eventually Washington will have to choose between an outright default and hyperinflation, and the rest of the world is waking up to that fact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some “dynamism,” some “innovation”…</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“America continues to attract striving immigrants.”</em></p>
<p>Obama’s statement is correct. It does not illustrate America’s alleged strength as was his intent, however; it underscores this country’s major weakness. <a href="http://www.krgv.com/news/lawmaker-illegal-immigration-spiraling-out-of-control" target="_blank">Illegal immigration is spiraling out of control</a>, the Border Patrol is overwhelmed. If the influx continues at current high levels, the U.S. population will increase to almost half a billion in 2060 – more than a 50 percent increase. New immigrants – mostly from the Third World, unskilled, uneducated, and a net drain on American resources – and their descendants will account for over one hundred million of that increase. On current form, English-speaking Americans of European origin will become a minority in their own country four decades from now. They will inhabit an increasingly overpopulated, polluted, lumpenproleterized, permanently impoverished country. America unfortunately does continue “to attract striving immigrants,” mostly illegal ones and of poor quality. This is far greater threat to the survival of the United States in a historically or culturally recognizable form than terrorism or any conceivable alliance of foreign powers. Barack Obama does not understand this, or does not care, or – just as likely – cherishes the prospect.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“The values of our founding inspire leaders in parliaments and new movements in public squares around the globe.”</em></p>
<p>By “public squares” Obama was probably alluding to Kiev’s Maidan. Indeed, it has propelled some “new movements” to global prominence, such as the Svoboda party and the Right Sector. The Founding Fathers would be horrified to learn that, in the opinion of the President of the United States, their values have inspired Messrs. Tyahnybok, Yarosh, and other blood-soaked heirs to Stepan Bandera. This is on par with <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/good-revolutions-gone-bad" target="_blank">Senator Joseph Lieberman saying</a>, “The United States of America and the Kosovo Liberation Army stand for the same values and principles. Fighting for the KLA is fighting for human rights and American values.”</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“And when a typhoon hits the Philippines, or schoolgirls are kidnapped in Nigeria, or masked men occupy a building in Ukraine, it is America that the world looks to for help.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Obama is mixing apples (natural disasters) and pears (man-made ones). The problem of Islamic terrorism in Nigeria was exacerbated by the refusal of the Department of State under Hillary Clinton to place Boko Haram (“Secular Education is Sinful”) on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011, despite the urging of the Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA, and over a dozen Senators and Congressmen. The <em>de facto</em> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/09/opinion/gingrich-hillary-clinton-boko-haram-terrorist" target="_blank">protection thus given to Boko Haram</a> has enabled it to morph into a state-within-the-state with an estimated 300,000 followers.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It would be ironic if “the world” were to look to America for help in Ukraine (which in any event it does not), since the course of crisis there has been, overwhelmingly, of Washington’s own making, as manifested in Victoria Nuland’s famous phone call to Ambassador Pyatt. The new <em>Drang nach Osten</em>makes sense from the point of view of the liberal globalist-neoconservative duopoly: there is no better way to ensure U.S. dominance along the European rimland in perpetuity than drawing Europe back into NATO (i.e. U.S.) security orbit in general and subverting the Russo-German rapprochement in particular. The “masked men” in buildings are a direct consequence of American meddling.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“So the United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century past, and it will be true for the century to come.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It has never been true, it is not true now, and it never will be true. Madeleine Albright’s famous dictum was an arrogant statement by an immigrant ignorant of American history and a sign of her well-attested instability. It was reiterated in Bill Clinton’s 1996 speech, where he <a href="http://opinion.inquirer.net/39396/the-indispensable-nation" target="_blank">explained why he intervened, disastrously, in Bosnia</a>: “The fact is America remains the indispensable nation. There are times when America, and only America, can make a difference between war and peace, between freedom and repression, between hope and fear.” That Obama has chosen to recycle such rubbish is a sign of intellectual and moral bankruptcy. “Indispensable” to whom, exactly? It is unimaginable for the leader of any other country in the world – Vladimir Putin, say, or Xi Jinping – to advance such a claim. It is tasteless at best and psychotically grandomaniac at worst, a latter day “Manifest Destiny” on steroids. The problem is that such hubristic delusions easily translate into non-negotiable foreign policy objectives. Resisting the will of the “indispensable nation” is <em>ipso facto</em> evil: Susan Rice’s condemnation of Chinese and Russian vetoes of the U.S.-supported UN Security Council resolution on Syria as “disgusting,” “shameful” and “unforgivable” comes to mind.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“Russia’s aggression towards former Soviet states unnerves capitals in Europe while China’s economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Quite apart from the genesis of the crisis in Ukraine, to which “Russia’s aggression” hardly applies, Obama’s use of the term “former Soviet states,” plural, implies that in his opinion Ukraine is not the only “victim of Russia’s aggression.” Presumably he means Georgia, the only “former Soviet state” with which Russia has had a conflict since the collapse of the Soviet Union. If so, and there is no other explanation for his turn of his phrase, Obama has a dangerously flawed understanding of the August 2008 Georgian crisis.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Georgian then-President Mikheil Saakashvili’s order to attack South Ossetia’s capital, Tskhinvali, was a breathtakingly audacious challenge to Russia, to which she was bound to react forcefully. That response was promptly exploited, for the first time since Gorbachev, by the American mainstream media machine and the foreign-policy community in Washington to paint Russia as a rogue power that is not only dangerous but intrinsically malignant. The vehemence of that rhetoric exceeded anything ever said or written about <em>jihad</em>, before or after September 11. To be fair, Saakashvili was led to believe that he was tacitly authorized to act as he did. President George W. Bush had treated Georgia as a “strategic partner” ever since the Western-engineered “Rose Revolution” five years earlier, and in early 2008 he strongly advocated NATO membership for Georgia. Washington had repeatedly supported Georgia’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity,” which implied the right to use force to bring South Ossetia and Abkhazia to heel, just as it is supporting “resolute action” in Donetsk and Lugansk today. Saakashvili may be forgiven for imagining that the United States would have bailed him out if things went badly. It is noteworthy that he was not disabused of such notions. The calculus in Washington appears to have been based on a win-win scenario, not dissimilar to the current Ukrainian strategy. Had Georgian troops occupied South Ossetia in a blitzkrieg operation modeled after Croatia’s “Operation Storm,” while the Russians remained hesitant or ineffective, Moscow would have suffered a major strategic and (more importantly) psychological defeat after almost four years of sustained strategic recovery. If Russia intervened, however, she would be duly demonized and the U.S. would push for NATO consolidation with new vigor. “Old” Europeans – the Germans especially – would be pressed to abandon their détente with Moscow. A resentful Georgia would become chronically anti-Russian, thus ensuring a long-term American presence in the region.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">In the event, like the Ukrainian army today, the Georgian army performed so poorly that a military <em>fait accompli</em> was out of its reach. Excesses against Ossetian civilians – just like the shelling of schools in Slavyansk today – made the “victim of aggression” narrative hard to sell, Obama’s “aggression” rhetoric notwithstanding.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“The question we face… is not whether America will lead but how we will lead, not just to secure our peace and prosperity but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It is unclear how, if at all, America will secure her own “peace and prosperity” in the years and decades to come, let alone how she can extend it “around the globe.” If this is a statement of Obama’s grand strategy, it is flawed in principle and unfeasible in detail. In this statement there is not a hint of an overall blueprint for action that matches our country’s resources to her vital interests. A sound grand strategy enables a state to deploy its political, military, economic, and moral resources in a balanced and proportionate manner, in order to protect and enhance its security and promote its well-being, never mind “the globe.” In Obama’s universe, however, there are no brains behind “indispensable,” heavy-handed diplomacy and military power. Obama creates a false dilemma (“the question we face”) unsupported by facts. China, India, Russia, the Muslim world and Latin America do not want to be “led,” quite the contrary. Old Europe is reluctant at best. Subsaharan Africa is an irrelevant mess. <em>The question we face</em> is not global leadership, but national survival.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“Regional aggression that goes unchecked, whether in southern Ukraine or the South China Sea or anywhere else in the world, will ultimately impact our allies, and could draw in our military. We can’t ignore what happens beyond our boundaries.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">This simultaneous dig at Russia and China reflects a hubristic world view that is unmatched by conflict-management resources. A sane American relationship with Moscow demands acceptance that Russia has legitimate interests in her “near-abroad.” Obama’ four-nation tour of East Asia last Aprilescalated existing U.S. military commitments to the region, created some new ones, deeply irritated China, and emboldened American allies and clients to play hardball with Beijing. Obama does not understand that it is extremely dangerous for a great power to alienate two of its nearest rivals simultaneously. The crisis in Ukraine is going on, but the situation in Asia is potentially more volatile. Dealing with both theaters from the position of presumed strength and trying to dictate the outcomes is perilous, as many would-be hegemons (Philip II, Louis XIV, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, Hitler), blinded by arrogance, have learned to their peril. Obama has continued the hegemonist habit of instigating crises at different spots around the world, even though the resources are scarce and the strategy is fundamentally faulty. An overtly anti-U.S. alliance between Russia and China is now in the making. U.S. overreach led to the emergence of a <em>de facto</em> alliance in the Eurasian Heartland, embodied in the gas deal signed in Shanghai. Russia and China are not natural allies and they may have divergent long-term interests, especially in Central Asia, but they are on the same page when it comes to resisting U.S. hegemony, pardon, “leadership.” In the early 1970’s Dr. Henry Kissinger wisely understood the benefits of an opening to Beijing as a means of pressuring Moscow on the Cold War’s central front. Back then the USSR was far more powerful than the People’s Republic. Today, by contrast, China is much more economically and demographically powerful than Russia, and for the United States the optimal strategy would dictate being on good terms with the weaker party in the triangle. America does not have a policymaker of Kissinger’s stature today, who would understand the potential of a long-term understanding with Moscow as a tool of curtailing Chinese ambitions along the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“America must always lead on the world stage. If we don’t, no one else will. The military that you have joined is, and always will be, the backbone of that leadership.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">The notion that “the world stage” demands a “leader” is flawed. It is at fundamental odds with the balance-of-power paradigm, which has historically secured the longest periods of peace and unprecedented prosperity to the civilized world. Today’s world is being multipolarized, whether Obama the Exceptionalist likes that or not. The very idea of the self-awarded “world leadership” would appear absurd in the days of Bismarck or Metternich. Washington has neither the resources nor the minds for such a role, even if it were called for.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“The United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it &#8212; when our people are threatened; when our livelihoods are at stake; when the security of our allies is in danger.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">None of the above applied in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, or Libya… but enough of Obama. There was more rhetoric at West Point, including an ode to American exceptionalism and further references to America’s global leadership, but it just as tedious, vacuous and intellectually wanting as the first ten minutes of his address.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Overall, it is evident that the United States in Barack Obama’s final term has not given up the hegemonist habit of instigating crises at different spots around the world, even though the management resources are scarce and the strategy is fundamentally faulty. An overtly anti-U.S. alliance between Russia and China is now in the making. It will be a belated equivalent of the Franco-Russian alliance of 1893 – the predictable result of an earlier great power, Wilhelm’s Kaiserreich, basing its strategy on hubristic overestimation of its capabilities. U.S. overreach has led to the emergence of a <em>de facto</em> alliance in the Eurasian Heartland, embodied in last month’s energy agreement signed in Shanghai. Russia and China are not natural allies and they may have divergent long-term interests, especially in Central Asia, but they are on the same page when it comes to resisting U.S. hegemony.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">In the early 1970’s Dr. Henry Kissinger wisely understood the benefits of an opening to Beijing as a means of pressuring Moscow on the Cold War’s central front. Back then the USSR was far more powerful than the People’s Republic. Today, by contrast, China is much more economically and demographically powerful than Russia, and for the United States the optimal strategy would dictate being on good terms with the weaker party in the triangle. It is unfortunate that America does not have a policymaker of Kissinger’s stature today, who would understand the potential of a long-term understanding with Moscow as a tool of curtailing Chinese ambitions along the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Judging by the West Point address, for the remaining two and a half years of Obama’s term U.S.-initiated global confrontations will continue as before. Instead of de-escalating the bloody mess to which she has made a hefty contribution, Victoria Nuland will continue encouraging her blood-soaked protégés in Kiev to seek a military end-game in the East. Instead of calming the South China Sea, Washington will continue encouraging its clients to be impertinent. And Putin and Xi will draw their conclusions: that they do have a powerful common enemy, a rogue regime not amenable to reason or rational calculus.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It cannot be otherwise, considering the Obama Administration’s 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, which is but a rehash of the strategic assumptions of the Bush era. In Obama’s words from two years ago, our “enduring national interest” is to maintain the unparalleled U.S. military superiority, “ready for the full range of contingencies and threats” amid “a complex and growing array of security challenges across the globe.” The Guidance itself asserts that the task of the United States is to “confront and defeat aggression anywhere in the world.” This is not a grand strategy but a blueprint for disaster—especially when combined with the interventionists’ urge to “confront and defeat” not only aggression as such but also “aggression” resulting from  internal conflicts irrelevant to the American interest (Syria, Ukraine) and putative threats to regional stability (Iran).</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Obama is a more reluctant interventionist than McCain or Romney would have been, but he, too, does not recognize the limits of American power and does not correlate that power with this country’s security and prosperity. He fails to balance military and nonmilitary, short and long-term capabilities. He rejects the fact that the world is becoming multipolar again, while the relative power of the United States is in steady decline. Obama’s absence of a viable grand strategy produces policies that are disjointed, nonsensical, and self-defeating. He is prone, no less than his predecessor, to equate any stated political objective in some faraway land with America’s vital interests, without ever offering a coherent definition of those “vital” interests.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">On both sides of the duopoly, the ideology of American exceptionalism and the doctrine of global dominance reign supreme. At a time of domestic economic weakness and cultural decline, foreign policy based on the American interest requires prudence, restraint, and a rational link between ends and means. Abroad, it demands disengagement from distant countries of which we know little; at home, a sane immigration policy.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It will not happen.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Prior to the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq, US and other western oil companies were all but completely shut out of Iraq’s oil market. But thanks to the invasion and occupation, the companies are now back inside Iraq and producing oil there for the first time since being forced out of the country in 1973.”</p>
<p>– Antonia Juhasz, oil industry analyst,  Al Jazeera.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are the ‘best of times’ for the oil giants in Iraq.  Production is up, profits are soaring, and big oil is rolling in dough.  Here’s the story from the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Iraq’s oil production surged to its highest level in over 30 years last month, surprising skeptics of the country’s efforts to restore its oil industry after decades of war and neglect.”  (Wall Street Journal)</p></blockquote>
<p>Mission accomplished?</p>
<p>You bet.  But for those who still cling to the idea that the US was serious about promoting democracy or removing a vicious dictator or  eliminating WMD or any of the other kooky excuses, consider what we’ve learned in the last couple weeks. Here’s the story from Aljazeera:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While the US military has formally ended its occupation of Iraq, some of the largest western oil companies, ExxonMobil, BP and Shell, remain.</p>
<p>On November 27, 38 months after Royal Dutch Shell announced its pursuit of a massive gas deal in southern Iraq, the oil giant had its contract signed for a $17bn flared gas deal. Three days later, the US-based energy firm Emerson submitted a bid for a contract to operate at Iraq’s giant Zubair oil field, which reportedly holds some eight million barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Emerson was awarded a contract to provide crude oil metering systems and other technology for a new oil terminal in Basra, currently under construction in the Persian Gulf, and the company is installing control systems in the power stations in Hilla and Kerbala. Iraq’s supergiant Rumaila oil field is already being developed by BP, and the other supergiant reserve, Majnoon oil field, is being developed by Royal Dutch Shell. Both fields are in southern Iraq.” (“Western oil firms remain as US exits Iraq”, Dahr Jamail, Aljazeera.)</p></blockquote>
<p>If it sounds like the big boys are dividing the spoils among themselves; it’s because they are. Exxon, BP, Shell; they’re all here. They all have their contracts in hand, and they’re all drilling their brains out thanks to the American servicemen and women who gave their lives for some trumped up baloney about WMD. Isn’t that what’s going on?</p>
<p>Sure it is. And even now–after all the reasons for going to war have been exposed as lies–the farce continues. Nothing has changed. Nothing. There’s still no talk of reparations, no official investigation, no indictments, no prosecutions, no trials, no penalties, no nothing. Not even a stinking apology. Just a big “up yours” Iraq. We’re way too important to apologize for killing a million of your people and reducing your five thousand year old civilization to a pile of rubble.  Instead, we’ll just screw you some more and paper it over with a little public relations, like Obama did a couple weeks ago when he promised to “leave behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people”.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. Obama’s all about sovereignty and stability, everyone knows that.  That’s why Baghdad is the terror capital of the world, because Obama’s so committed to security.</p>
<p>These PR blurbs are effective though, they provide the necessary cover for leaving enough troops behind to protect the oil installations and pipelines.  That’s the kind of security Obama cares about. Security for the oiligarchs and their stolen property.  Everyone else can fend for themselves, which is why Baghdad is such a bloody mess.  Here’s more from Aljazeera:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Prior to the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq, US and other western oil companies were all but completely shut out of Iraq’s oil market,” oil industry analyst Antonia Juhasz told Al Jazeera. “But thanks to the invasion and occupation, the companies are now back inside Iraq and producing oil there for the first time since being forced out of the country in 1973.” (Aljazeera)
</p></blockquote>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/iraqwarforoil3.jpg"  /></p>
</div>
<p>Yeah, thanks for that invasion, Mr. Bush. We couldn’t have done it without you, guy. Hope you have a great retirement painting pictures of poodles and stuff while people continue to get blown to pieces in the terrorist Hellhole you created. Here’s more Al Jazeera:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Juhasz, author of the books The Tyranny of Oil and The Bush Agenda, said that while US and other western oil companies have not yet received all they had hoped the US-led invasion of Iraq would bring them, “They’ve certainly done quite well for themselves, landing production contracts for some of the world’s largest remaining oil fields under some of the world’s most lucrative terms.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr Abdulhay Yahya Zalloum, an international oil consultant and economist …(said) he believes western oil companies have successfully acquired the lions’ share of Iraq’s oil, “but they gave a little piece of the cake for China and some of the other countries and companies to keep them silent”. (Aljazeera)</p>
<p>How do you like that? These guys operate just like the Mafia. The Bossman pays off China with a few million barrels, and China keeps its mouth shut. Nice. Everyone gets “their cut” so they don’t go blabbing to the media about the ripoff that’s taking place in broad daylight. The stench of corruption is overpowering.</p>
<p>And here’s something else you won’t see in the media. In a White House press release,  the Obama administration announced that they would continue to support Iraq’s “efforts to develop the energy sector” in order  to “help boost Iraq’s oil production.”….</p>
<p>According to Assim Jihad, spokesman for Iraq’s ministry of oil, “Iraq has a goal of raising its oil production capacity to 12m bpd by 2017, which would place it in the top echelon of global producers.” (Aljazeera)</p>
<p>“12 million barrels-per-day by 2017″?</p>
<p>That makes this the biggest petroleum heist in history. And we’re supposed to believe that the oil bigwigs didn’t know anything about this before the war? What a crock! I’ll bet you even money the CEOs and their lackeys figured out that Saudi Arabia was running out of gas, so they decided to pick up stakes and move their operations to good old Mesopotamia. That’s why they put their money on Bush and Cheney, because they knew that two former oil men would do the heavy lifting once they got shoehorned into the White House.  The whole thing was a set-up from the get-go, right down to the 5 shady Supremes who suspended the voting in Florida and crowned Bush emperor in 2000. The whole thing was probably mapped out years in advance.</p>
<p>Big oil runs everything in America. People talk about the power of Wall Street and Israel, but oil is still king. They run it all, and they own it all. And “what they say, goes.”  Here’s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Juhasz explained that ExxonMobil, BP and Shell were among the oil companies that “played the most aggressive roles in lobbying their governments to ensure that the invasion would result in an Iraq open to foreign oil companies”.</p>
<p>They succeeded,” she added. “They are all back in.” (Aljazeera)</p></blockquote>
<p>Hooray. Big oil wins again, and all it cost was a million or so Iraqis who got blown to bits air raids or shot up at checkpoints, or beaten to death with a rubber hose at Abu Ghraib or any of the other democracy reeducation centers that dot the countryside. But, hey, look at the bright side: At least production is up, right? Can you see how sick this is? Here’s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Under the current circumstances, the possibility of a withdrawal of western oil companies from Iraq appears remote, and the Obama administration continues to pressure Baghdad to pass the Iraq Oil Law.” (Aljazeera)</p></blockquote>
<p>And what is the “Iraq Oil Law”, you ask?</p>
<p>It’s a way to privatize the oil market using Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs) which disproportionately benefit the corporations.  Obama’s a big backer of the law since it means even heftier profits for his thieving  friends.  In other words, the humongous profits they’re already skimming off aren’t quite good enough. They want more. They want to own the whole shooting match lock, stock and barrel.</p>
<p>This is really an outrage. What other country behaves like this?</p>
<p>No one. No other country in the world goes out and kills a million people, destroys their country, and leaves them to scrape by on next to nothing just so they can pad the bank accounts of voracious plutocrats have more dough than they know what to do with. No one else would even dare to act like that for fear that they’d get bombed into annihilation by the world’s biggest bullyboy, the US of A.  Only the US can get away with this type of crap, because the US is a law unto itself.</p>
<p>Iraq was the Cradle of Civilization. Now it’s the cradle of shit. The US decimated Iraq; blew it to bits, bombed its industries, its bridges, its schools, its hospitals, leveled its cities, polluted its water, spread diseases everywhere, killed its kids,  pitted brother against brother,   and transformed a vibrant, unique country into a dysfunctional cesspit run by opportunists, gangsters, and fanatics.</p>
<p>And, here’s the corker:  No one gives a rip. Face it: No one gives a flying fu** about Iraq. The American people lost interest long ago, the politicians can’t be bothered, and the UN is too afraid of the US to lift a finger to help. They’d rather stamp their feet and scold Putin over Crimea than utter a peep about the genocide in Iraq.  That’s the state of things today, right?  No accountability for the men who started the war, and no justice for the victims. Just the infrequent (phony) pronouncement of support from the White House or the all-too-frequent sectarian bombing that leaves an untold number of civilians dead or wounded. This is all the US leaves behind; hatred, death and destruction.</p>
<p>Here’s a clip from a poem by Iraqi writer who wants readers to take a minute and think about all the suffering the United States has created. The poem is titled “Flying Kites”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Come and see our overflowing morgues and find our little ones for us…</p>
<p>You may find them in this corner or the other, a little hand poking out, pointing out at you…</p>
<p>Come and search for them in the rubble of your “surgical” air raids, you may find a little leg or a little head…pleading for your attention.</p>
<p>Come and see them amassed in the garbage dumps, scavenging morsels of food…</p>
<p>Come and see  our little ones, under-nourished or dying from disease. Cholera, dysentery, infections…</p>
<p>Come and see, come….”  (“Flying Kites” Layla Anwar)</p></blockquote>
<p>A million people were killed so a few rich fu**ers could get even richer. That’s a hell of a legacy.</p>

<p>What is now called the Tea Party began in 2007 as a loosely-organized yet highly-motivated grassroots support effort for Congressman Ron Paul&#8217;s bid for the White House. Since those early days, a lot has happened to the Tea Party.</p>
<p>For one thing, the Tea Party is now much larger and broader than any one person&#8217;s political candidacy. And though a Tea Party candidate has not yet obtained the White House (Ron Paul was the lone Tea Party Republican candidate in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections), a host of Tea Party candidates have won several elections in the US House and Senate&#8211;as well as many State and local races. And to win these elections, Tea Party candidates have had to repel the attacks against them from the Republican establishment. In fact, the GOP establishment is far and away the Tea Party&#8217;s biggest enemy.</p>
<p>Republican leaders such as John Boehner, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Peter King, etc., have made one of their missions in life to defeat Republican Tea Party candidates&#8211;even if those candidates are incumbents. This is for good reason: the establishment Republican Party is diametrically opposed to the goals and principles of the Tea Party.</p>
<p>Based on the positions of most Tea Party candidates (which is all we have to go on as the Tea Party is not a real political party but only a grassroots activist effort being conducted mainly within the Republican Party), the goals and objectives of the Tea Party can be summarized generally as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>They support a non-interventionist foreign policy.</li>
<li>They support the Constitution and recognize the current attacks against the Constitution, especially against the Second, Fourth, and Tenth Amendments.</li>
<li>They oppose the NSA spying on the American citizenry (including the use of drones for such purposes).</li>
<li>They oppose the Patriot Act and the militarization of the Department of Homeland Security as well as local and State law enforcement agencies.</li>
<li>They oppose the Import-Export Bank.</li>
<li>They oppose the Federal Reserve Bank.</li>
<li>They oppose CISPA.</li>
<li>They oppose the indefinite detention provision of the NDAA.</li>
<li>They support ending the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF).</li>
<li>They support limited government spending&#8211;especially at the federal level.</li>
</ul>
<p>One can easily see that many, if not most, of these goals and objectives are diametrically opposite the goals and objectives of the establishment Republican machine. And more than anything else, the Republican leadership in Washington, D.C., wants GOP congressmen and senators to be &#8220;team players.&#8221; Of course, by &#8220;team players&#8221; they mean good little Republican robots that will not buck party leadership.</p>
<p>Since Representative Ron Paul retired, the Tea Party leader in the U.S. House is Justin Amash of Michigan. And working side-by-side Rep. Amash is Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky. In the U.S. Senate, the Tea Party is being led by men such as Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mike Lee of Utah, and Ted Cruz of Texas. There are several other Tea Party supporters in both the U.S. House and Senate, of course. It is no accident or coincidence that each of these congressmen and senators has incurred (and continue to incur) the wrath of establishment Republican leaders.</p>
<p>Congressman Peter King (R-NY) reserves his harshest rhetoric, not for any Democrat, but for Senator Rand Paul. King said that Rand Paul &#8220;disgraced his office,&#8221; he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t deserve to be in the U.S. Senate,&#8221; and he &#8220;tells absolute lies.&#8221; Karl Rove has repeatedly lambasted Justin Amash. House Speaker Boehner has spearheaded well-financed opposition to Amash&#8217;s reelection campaign this year. Senator John McCain (the GOP standard bearer in 2008) recently called Amash, Paul, and Cruz &#8220;wacko birds.&#8221; So much for Ronald Reagan&#8217;s 11th Commandment to not speak evil of fellow Republicans. It would appear that commandment only applies to not criticizing the GOP establishment, while Republicans espousing Tea Party convictions are open-season for Republican leaders to lampoon and lambast without mercy.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the GOP establishment spent over $1 million in a single House district race in an attempt to defeat 20-year Republican incumbent Walter Jones. The reason? Jones has a history of voting against the wishes of the party establishment&#8211;especially concerning the freedom issues listed above. Thankfully, they failed.</p>
<p>But all over the country, in national, State, and local elections, the GOP establishment is working feverishly to keep Tea Party candidates out of office or to defeat incumbent Republicans who support the Tea Party agenda. In fact, one way I can tell whether a candidate deserves my support or not is by the support or opposition he or she receives from the GOP establishment. If the Republican establishment supports him or her, I can pretty much know that I should vote for someone else.</p>
<p>The reason that Boehner, Karl Rove, and other big-government Republican leaders are trying so hard to defeat Justin Amash in particular is due to the fact that Amash has quietly but effectively spearheaded the momentum of small-government conservatives on Capitol Hill. Since the retirement of Ron Paul, Amash has successfully formed a potent coalition of constitutionally-minded Republicans within the Tea Party movement. He calls his coalition the &#8220;House Liberty Caucus.&#8221; Of course, most of the framework for this caucus was put together by former Congressman Ron Paul.</p>
<p>Since Justin Amash was elected to the House and Rand Paul was elected to the Senate in 2010, eight of the eleven Ron Paul-endorsed congressional candidates won elections in 2012, including Senator Ted Cruz. All of these folks had significant Tea Party support. Boehner and Rove have reason to be worried. No wonder Amash&#8217;s establishment-endorsed opponent has over $1 million to spend trying to oust him. No wonder the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (a long-time establishment organization) has unveiled a $50 million war chest designed to defeat Tea Party congressmen nationwide.</p>
<p>And please know this, too: the establishment has done its best to infiltrate the Tea Party so as to dilute its message and weaken its effectiveness. In fact, some Tea Parties around the country are now mostly dominated by establishment neocons. Thank God, many, if not most, of the Tea Parties around the country are still mostly comprised of strong, constitutionally-minded, non-establishment folks who refuse to bow to the GOP hierarchy. But we must be aware of the neocon infiltration that has taken place among many Tea Parties.</p>
<p>In virtually every political race this year&#8211;including national, State, county, and city&#8211;the establishment will be working tirelessly to elect their hand-picked neocons. When you hear Tea Party-type candidates being lampooned as &#8220;wacko&#8221; or &#8220;far right,&#8221; etc., when you hear their critics and detractors say, &#8220;He can&#8217;t win,&#8221; please understand that you are listening to an establishment elitist whose job is to undermine the candidacies of those folks who refuse to go along with the establishment. Many of these critics will call themselves &#8220;conservatives.&#8221; They will say they are simply being &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; and &#8220;reasonable.&#8221; Hogwash! What they are doing is trying to ensure that non-establishment candidates never get elected.</p>
<p>The future of the Republican Party&#8211;or even if there is a Republican Party in the future&#8211;depends on the next few elections and whether or not the establishment will be able to bully and buy-off the votes of the American people. When John Boehner, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush, Karl Rove, etc., demand that Congress provide amnesty for illegal aliens, when they try to ram their elitist, big-government agenda down the throats of congressmen and senators, when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to defeat Tea Party Republicans, you can rest assured that they are not seeking the welfare of the country or even of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The big-government establishment doesn&#8217;t give a flip about freedom, the Constitution, or even the constituent back home. What they care about is THEM. They have become part of a wealthy and powerful cabal of miscreants who are going to be well-taken-care-of NO MATTER WHAT. They are themselves the pawns of evil power-brokers; and in order to survive, they must make sure that there are other pawns coming to Washington, D.C., to keep the power base intact.</p>
<p>This is a war. It is not only a political war; it is a spiritual war. It is a war for both the soul of the Republican Party (which at present, there isn&#8217;t much of one left) and the soul of the country. It would really help if our pastors and churches could awaken to this war and help us fight it. The establishment knows it&#8217;s a war; and they are fighting it with every ounce of energy in their collective being. And they have declared the Tea Party as public enemy number one.</p>
<p>What started as one congressman&#8217;s presidential bid back in 2007 has now become a full-blown assault on the big-government establishment in Washington, D.C.&#8211;and around the country. The result is there is now a small army of Ron Pauls on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>I urge you to ignore the shills of the establishment and go to the polls in the primaries this year and elect as many non-establishment candidates as you possibly can. Let&#8217;s give Karl Rove and John Boehner something to really worry about.</p>

<p><strong>In 2008, Houston police pulled over CIA agent Roland Carnaby on what appeared to be a routine traffic stop. A few seconds later, Carnaby was dead.</strong></p>
<p>It is illegal to detain a CIA agent under any circumstances. They may carry any weapon, anywhere, anytime, and request assistance from any law enforcement official with more than certainty.</p>
<p>Why then would this incident be part of a highly classified Russian intelligence report? Could it, perhaps, be that Carnaby, answering directly to former President and CIA Director, George H.W. Bush, was murdered to silence his participation in the theft and sale of American nuclear warheads?</p>
<p>Carnaby was holding a trove of documents outlining the theft and transfer of hundreds of nuclear warheads from the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas. Weapons sent there for disassembly were transshipped to Israel and, from there, refurbished, their cores remachined and then sold around the world or stored in Israeli embassies and consulates around the world.</p>
<p>The Russian report outlines a very different view of the past 30 years, a “view” that “fits like a glove.”</p>
<p><strong>DIMONA OUT OF ACTION</strong></p>
<p>The report not only confirms Israel’s nuclear weapon inventory but outlines the program of subterfuge and piracy required to keep Israel as a nuclear power after their facility at Dimona suffered a critical “event” in 1988.</p>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #5b5b5b;"><p>“Dimona is a standard 75-megawatt thermal open top reactor as used in France for their plutonium weapons production program, their version of Stanford (Editor&#8217;s note: Probably &#8220;Hanford&#8221;).</p>
<p>Due to overuse as a fast breeder reactor by the Israelis, Dimona suffered a &#8220;steam explosion&#8221; IE a flash over indecent due to neutron criticality back in the late 1980&#8242;s under Bush 1. This shut down its operation for many years until repairs could be made.</p>
<p>It know only operates at very low power levels due to neutron absorption damage to the containment vessel. Now mainly use for isotope production. This forced the Israelis to turn to stolen nuclear stockpiles from the US for the continuation of their nuclear program.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The highly classified Russian report, released, experts believe, to demonstrate American hypocrisy over recent events in the Ukraine, is a litany of horror stories. If this is a “first shot over the bow” by Russian intelligence, American officials can only dread what may be to come.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND<br />
</strong></p>
<p>48 hours ago, the retired chief of Russia’s counter-intelligence effort for the Middle East released a highly classified report designed to embarrass the United States and demonstrate their servitude to Israel and complicity in broad acts of nuclear proliferation.</p>
<p>The report, loaded with “shock value” intelligence and backed by reams of supporting documents including classified nuclear weapons plans demonstrated that Russia has been able to maintain a high level of penetration of not just American nuclear weapons labs but security agencies as well.</p>
<p><strong>ROUND ONE, 9/11</strong></p>
<p>The report, carefully structured for maximum shock value, begins with 9/11, the watershed event of our era:</p>
<p>“The type of nuclear devices used on 911 were a modified version of the W-54 nuclear artillery shells that were covertly provided to the Israelis between 1988 and 1998 from US surplus stockpiles illegally exported during the Bush/Clinton era.</p>
<p>Chemical analysis done by DOE Sandi was able to identify the chemical/radiation footprint or fingerprint of the warheads based on samples taken after 911 of the fallout at ground zero.”</p>
<p>According to the report, 911 was an Israeli operation facilitated by blackmail of Bush 41 and 43, threatening them with “outing” for their personal financial involvement in the sale of 350 primarily w54 nuclear artillery rounds, sold through Israel but distributed to a number of nations.</p>
<p>The Russian report further outlines that NATO partners, particularly Britain and France, were involved every step of the way. 911 was cover for stolen gold, stock fraud and the looting of the American economy. The “wars for profit” were the Bush boys cashing in on their own.</p>
<p><strong>THE “HOW” OF 911</strong></p>
<p>A number of theories have been introduced to explain the mysterious effects seen at ground zero on 9/11. In an article on the Press TV website, evidence of a widespread cover-up of an epidemic of radiation exposure-related cancers tied to 9/11, was presented.</p>
<p>Not only has Russia confirmed the Press TV findings, they present evidence of nuclear weapons use, evidence from a suppressed report based on findings by the Department of Energy’s Sandia Laboratories.</p>
<p>“Only a 2 kiloton device was needed to drop the buildings. A 2 kiloton device will produce a fireball of apx 150 to 200 feet in diameter at over 4000 degrees Centigrade. Just large enough to melt the I beams of the central core of the building and drop them in place. The light flash would last less than 1 second and primarily be in the UV light range. Overpressure would only be at 60PSI max and directed upwards with the blast.</p>
<p>Fallout would be minimal and located to within ground zero range only. Radiation would drop to acceptable levels within 72 hrs. after the blast. Most fall out was trapped in the cement dust thus causing all of the recent cancer deaths that we are now seeing in NYC amongst first responders.”</p>
<p>The report continues with details that close the door on speculation about 9/11, putting an end to conspiracy theories and, in particular, the wildest one of all, the pseudo-science fairy tale broadly rejected by the 9/11 Commission but allowed to stand as America descended into an Islamophobic frenzy.</p>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #5b5b5b;"><p>“Fallout would be minimal and located to within ground zero range only. Radiation would drop to acceptable levels within 72 hrs. after the blast. Most fall out was trapped in the cement dust thus causing all of the recent cancer deaths that we are now seeing in NYC amongst first responders.</p>
<p>Melted steel and iron oxide or &#8220;nano thermite&#8221; is a byproduct of the very high gamma ray / Neutron flux induced into the central steel core. The radiation dissolves the steel into iron oxide consuming the carbon and silicone in the steel.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This explains the missing steel columns and the very important clue of the &#8220;vaporized” 20 ton antenna tower atop the south tower. The upward blast of radiation literally vaporized it. Video evidence proves this to be true.</p>
<p>The total (redacted) data file from DOE Sandia on the 911 event is well over 72 MB. “P.S. Snowden didn’t have a Q clearance so he missed this one.”</p>
<p>The scope of the Bush/Cheney/Israeli nuclear proliferation operation, according to the report, is well beyond anything imagined. Here, Russia places the blame, naming not only Vice President Dick Cheney and former White House Chief of Staff Ram Emanuel but Tom Countryman, tasked, according to Russian sources, with actually managing the program that spread nuclear weapons to Brazil, North and South Korea, Saudi Arabia and a number of other nations.</p>
<p>“Illegal distribution of US nuclear material to foreign allies was not limited to Israel. Virtually all NATO allies were in on this scam too. Dick Cheney was the bad guy on this one. Bush2/Cheney traded nuclear pits to foreign country as IOU’s in order to get what they wanted. Tom Countryman a well-known Israeli operative is curiously now in charge of N.N.P. at the State Department under Obama. He was put there by Ram Emanuel.”</p>
<p><strong>REACTIVATING “DEAD NUKES”</strong></p>
<p>Only nuclear weapons that had deteriorated but could be recommissioned were of use to Israel. The Russian report outlines the basis for selecting the W-54 warhead and exacting details on how weapons were created out of America’s “nuclear scrap heap.”</p>
<p>“A total of over 350 pits were transferred to the Israelis over a 10 to 20 year period of time. The W-54 type of pit design were the most desirable due to the 2 point implosion pit design. This is the easiest to re manufacture and modify as compared to other circular pit designs.</p>
<p>The pill shaped design of the W-54 type weapon contains over 1.5 times more plutonium than a standard pit. This would allow enough Plutonium to be recovered that was still of weapons grade use even after 32 plus years of age. Americium build up in the pit over time eventually makes the Pit unusable as a weapon so they have a limited shelf life based on how fast or slow the Plutonium was produce in the reactor at Stanford.<br />
Usually it was about 150 days max. Irradiation time in the reactor during production determines the shelf life of the pit as weapons grade material. All of the micro nukes used by the Israelis are re-manufactured W-54 type series devices.”</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>According to the Russian report, Israel used remanufactured W-54 warheads, reconfigured as micro-nukes, for terror bombings in Bali, London and to destroy the Fukashima nuclear reaction site in Japan.</p>
<p>With weapons around the world, stored in embassies and consulates, and their powerful friends in the American “right,” Israel has managed to maintain nuclear superpower status without a real production facility, using only pirates and traitors, something America, according to our Russian sources, seems to have no shortage of.</p>

<p style="color: #494949;">Two important recent events – Narendra Modi’s landslide victory in India last week and the massive energy and trade agreement which Russia and China signed in Beijing on Wednesday – have the potential to alter Asia’s strategic landscape.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Modi is an assertive politician unafraid to take risks, a market-oriented reformer, but also a Hindu nationalist. When <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/modi-hindutva-will-be-an-asset-in-foreign-affairs" target="_blank">asked recently about his approach to foreign affairs</a>, he replied “I believe in Hindutva &#8230; And I am confident my Hindutva face will be an asset when dealing with foreign affairs with other nations.” In other words, he will try to increase the country’s international visibility. Already on <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/106365008340884014708/indiafebruary2008#5167695725820478018" target="_blank">my visit to India six years ago</a>, several analysts and academics unsympathetic to the Congress government expressed hope that Gujarat’s then-Chief Minister would one day lead the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bharatiya_janata_party" target="_blank">Bharatiya Janata Party</a>(BJP) instead of its ageing founder Lal Krishna Advani. As they had expected, Advani led the BJP to a defeat at the 2009 general election, but it was not until last September that Modi was finally selected as the party’s prime ministerial candidate.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">The most controversial episode in Modi’s political career concerns anti-Muslim violence which swept Gujarat at the end of February 2002, after a fire – allegedly started by Muslim arsonists – destroyed a train packed with Hindu pilgrims, killing 58 of them. The Modi government imposed a curfew in major cities and issued shoot-at-sight orders, but some human rights groups and sections of the media accused him of taking inadequate action against the riots, or even sympathizing with them.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">This episode resulted in the U.S. government denying him a visa in 2005 under a section the Immigration and Nationality Act which makes foreign government officials ineligible if they are responsible for “particularly severe violations of religious freedom.” Even after India’s Supreme Court found no such evidence against Modi, the U.S. did not lift the ban. The campaign <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk6u40qybri" target="_blank">“to get Modi”</a> was particularly virulent during Hillary Clinton’s tenure at the State, <a href="http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/obama-quietly-reverses-hillarys-get-modi-policy" target="_blank">ostensibly for the 2002 riots, but in reality</a> “for taking stands that may be different from that favored by the U.S. administration.” As an Indian <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/narendra-modi-indias-shinzo-abe" target="_blank">commentator noted on the day of the election</a>, since the Obama Administration still has not expressed regret for its revocation of his visa, “Modi is unlikely to go out of his way to befriend the U.S. by seeking a White House visit. Instead, he is expected to wait for US officials to come calling.”</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">America’s relations with India can and should improve, and for all its many sins the administration of George W. Bush cultivated and improved them during his second term. First of all, in the context of the “Pivot to Asia” Washington should give up on the notion of using India as a southern prop of the U.S.-led geopolitical ring around China. There are potential common U.S.-Indian interests in balancing China’s growing might, but India under Modi’s leadership will base its foreign policy on the old-fashioned premises of national interests, and not on the notions of “shared values” and “joint responsibilities.”</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">While Modi will not continue the <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139098/manjari-chatterjee-miller/indias-feeble-foreign-policy" target="_blank">“feeble” foreign policy of his predecessors</a>, economic development and civil service reforms are his priorities. My contacts expect that his foreign agenda will include maintaining good relations with Iran, building stronger ties with Japan, and advancing a more resolute demand for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the world’s second most populous nation; yet “the toughest job he faces is to force the Indian Foreign Service mandarins to start thinking strategically.”</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">On the whole China has been doing a better job of translating its growing economic power into political and diplomatic influence. India’s long-term strategy will require a more effective balancing act vis-à-vis China to the north and Pakistan to the West. India’s traditionally close relationship with Russia – the country’s major arms supplier – is particularly important now that Moscow and Beijing are forging what is <em>de facto</em> strategic partnership.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">A word from Putin to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the desirability of seeking a new era of détente between Asia’s two giants could do a lot to defuse latent tensions on the Subcontinent. In Narendra Modi the nationalist, the Chinese may yet find a bolder and more imaginative partner for serious talks on the perennial border problem and other issues than in the ineffective and weak outgoing government.</p>

			<p><strong>“Comrade Wolf knows who to eat, and he eats without listening to anyone.” &#8211; Russian President Vladimir Putin referring to the United States&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/putinwest3.jpg"  /></p>
</div>
<p>The Ukraine crisis has its roots in a policy that dates back nearly 20 years. The origins of the policy can be traced to a 1997 article in Foreign Policy magazine by Zbigniew Brzezinski, titled “A Geostrategy for Eurasia.” The article makes the case that the United States needs to forcefully establish itself in Central Asia in order to maintain its position as the world’s only superpower. While many readers may be familiar with Brzezinski’s thinking on these matters, they might not know what he has to say about Russia, which is particularly illuminating given that the recent uptick in violence has less to do with Ukraine than it does with Washington’s proxy-war on Russia. Here’s what Brzezinski says:</p>
<p>“Russia’s longer-term role in Eurasia will depend largely on its self-definition…Russia’s first priority should be to modernize itself rather than to engage in a futile effort to regain its status as a global power. Given the country’s size and diversity, a decentralized political system and free-market economics would be most likely to unleash the creative potential of the Russian people and Russia’s vast natural resources. A loosely confederated Russia — composed of a European Russia, a Siberian Republic, and a Far Eastern Republic — would also find it easier to cultivate closer economic relations with its neighbors. Each of the confederated entitles would be able to tap its local creative potential, stifled for centuries by Moscow’s heavy bureaucratic hand. In turn, a decentralized Russia would be less susceptible to imperial mobilization.” Zbigniew Brzezinski, <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6266.htm">A Geostrategy for Eurasia</a>, Foreign Affairs, 76:5, September/October 1997.</p>
<p>So is this the goal of US policy, to create “A loosely confederated Russia” whose economy can be subsumed into America’s market-based system?</p>
<p>Notice how easily Brzezinski chops Russia into smaller, bite-size statelets that pose no threat to US imperial expansion. Brzezinski undoubtedly envisions a Russia that will sell its vast resources in petrodollars and recycle them into US Treasuries further enriching the corrupt rent-skimmers in Washington and Wall Street. He foresees a Russia that will abdicate its historic role in the world and have no say-so in shaping global policy. He imagines a compliant Russia that will help facilitate US imperial ambitions in Asia, even to the point where it will pay to police its own people on behalf of US oligarchs, weapons manufacturers, oil magnates, and 1 percenters. Here’s the paragraph in Brzezinski’s piece that sums up Washington’s objectives in Ukraine, Russia and beyond. It is fittingly headlined with the following words in bold print:</p>
<p><strong>TRANSCONTINENTAL SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>“Defining the substance and institutionalizing the form of a trans-Eurasian security system could become the major architectural initiative of the next century. The core of the new transcontinental security framework could be a standing committee composed of the major Eurasian powers, with America, Europe, China, Japan, a confederated Russia, and India collectively addressing critical issues for Eurasia’s stability. The emergence of such a transcontinental system could gradually relieve America of some of its burdens, while perpetuating beyond a generation its decisive role as Eurasia’s arbitrator. Geostrategic success in that venture would be a fitting legacy to America’s role as the first and only global superpower.” Zbigniew Brzezinski, “A Geostrategy for Eurasia,” Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Translation: The United States will police the world, dispatch troublemakers, and eliminate potential threats wherever it finds them. It will impose its neoliberal dogma (Austerity, privatization, structural adjustment, anti labor reforms, etc) across-the-board and on all participants. Also, minor partners–”Europe, China, Japan, a confederated Russia, and India”–will be expected to provide security for their own people at their own expense in order to “relieve America of some of its burdens.”</p>
<p>Nice, eh? So you even have to pay for your own jailers.</p>
<p>And what is “Transcontinental Security” anyway? Isn’t it just a fancy way of saying “one world government”?</p>
<p>Indeed, it is. It’s the very same thing. Here’s more from Brzezinski:</p>
<p>“Failure to widen NATO…would shatter the concept of an expanding Europe… Worse, it could reignite dormant Russian political aspirations in Central Europe.”</p>
<p>This is an oddly convoluted statement. In the first sentence, Brzezinski supports the idea of an “expanding Europe”, and then in the next breath, he worries that Russia might want to do the same thing. It’s another case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
<p>What’s clear, is that –in Brzezinski’s mind– EU and NATO expansion will help Washington achieve its hegemonic aspirations. That’s all that matters. Here’s what he says:</p>
<p>“Europe is America’s essential geopolitical bridgehead in Eurasia…A wider Europe and an enlarged NATO will serve the short-term and longer-term interests of U.S. policy… A politically defined Europe is also essential to Russia’s assimilation into a system of global cooperation.”</p>
<p>“Bridgehead”? In other words, Europe is just a means to an end. But what would that “end” be?</p>
<p>Global domination. Isn’t that what he’s talking about?</p>
<p>Of course, it is.</p>
<p>What makes the Ukrainian crisis so hard to understand, is that the media conceals the policy behind the impenetrable fog of daily events. Once the fog lifts though, it’s easy to see who’s causing all the trouble. It’s the party that’s calling the shots from abroad, the good old US of A.</p>
<p>Putin doesn’t want this war and neither do most Ukrainians. The whole thing was conjured up by Uncle Sam and his minions to stop the flow of Russian gas to Europe, to push NATO further eastward, and to break the Russian Federation into little pieces. That’s what it’s really all about. And these madmen are willing to raze Ukraine to the ground and kill every living organism within a 3,000 mile radius of Kiev to get their way. After all, isn’t that what they did in Iraq? They sure did. And did I mention that, according to this week’s Wall Street Journal, “Iraq’s Oil Output Surged to Highest Level in Over 30 Years” with all the usual suspects raking in hefty profits.</p>
<p>The point is, if they’d did it in Iraq, they’ll do it in Ukraine too. Because what Washington cares about is constituents not carnage. Carnage they can handle.</p>
<p>Brzezinski is not the only one supporting the current policy either. There’s also fellow traveler, Hillary Clinton. In fact, it was Secretary of State Clinton who first used the term “pivot” in a 2011 article in Foreign Policy Magazine titled “America’s Pacific Century”. Clinton’s op-ed described a “rebalancing” plan that would open up new markets to US corporations and Wall Street, control the flow of vital resources, and “forge a broad-based military presence” across the continent. Here’s an excerpt from the text of Clinton’s seminal speech:</p>
<p>“The future of politics will be decided in Asia, not Afghanistan or Iraq, and the United States will be right at the center of the action.</p>
<p>As the war in Iraq winds down and America begins to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan, the United States stands at a pivot point. Over the last 10 years, we have allocated immense resources to those two theaters. In the next 10 years, we need to be smart and systematic about where we invest time and energy, so that we put ourselves in the best position to sustain our leadership, secure our interests, and advance our values. One of the most important tasks of American statecraft over the next decade will therefore be to lock in a substantially increased investment — diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise — in the Asia-Pacific region…</p>
<p>Harnessing Asia’s growth and dynamism is central to American economic and strategic interests and a key priority for President Obama. Open markets in Asia provide the United States with unprecedented opportunities for investment, trade, and access to cutting-edge technology…..American firms (need) to tap into the vast and growing consumer base of Asia…The region already generates more than half of global output and nearly half of global trade. As we strive to meet President Obama’s goal of doubling exports by 2015, we are looking for opportunities to do even more business in Asia…</p>
<p>…as I talk with business leaders across our own nation, I hear how important it is for the United States to expand our exports and our investment opportunities in Asia’s dynamic markets.” (“America’s Pacific Century”, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton”, Foreign Policy Magazine, 2011)</p>
<p>“Harnessing Asia’s growth and dynamism is central to American economic and strategic interests and a key priority for President Obama”?</p>
<p>Does that sound like someone who wants to cultivate a mutually-beneficial relationship with their trading partners or someone who wants to move in, take over and run the show?</p>
<p>Washington’s plan to shift its attention from the Middle East to Asia is all about money. Clinton even says so herself. She says, “The region generates more than half of global output and nearly half of global trade…Asia’s markets … provide the United States with unprecedented opportunities for investment, trade, and…a vast and growing consumer base.”</p>
<p>Money, money, money. The upside-profit potential is limitless which is why Madame Clinton wants to plant Old Glory right in “the center of the action”, so US corporations can rake in the dough without fear of reprisal.</p>
<p>Brzezinski says the same thing in his magnum opus “The Grand Chessboard” Here’s an excerpt:</p>
<p>“A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world’s three most advanced and economically productive regions. A mere glance at the map also suggests that control over Eurasia would almost automatically entail Africa’s subordination, rendering the Western Hemisphere and Oceania (Australia) geopolitically peripheral to the world’s central continent. About 75 per cent of the world’s people live in Eurasia, and most of the world’s physical wealth is there as well, both in its enterprises and underneath its soil. Eurasia accounts for about three-fourths of the world’s known energy resources.” (Zbigniew Brzezinski, “The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy And It’s Geostrategic Imperatives”, page 31)</p>
<p>Get the picture? It’s a gold rush! Having successfully looted every last farthing from the battered US middle class and left the economy in a ghastly shambles, Brzezinski, Clinton and Co. are headed for greener pastures in Central Asia, home of the world’s largest oil producing nation, boundless reserves in the Caspian Basin, and zillions of voracious consumers who’ll need everything from I Pads to leisure wear, all graciously provided by US-owned corporations. Cha-ching!</p>
<p>So don’t get tripped up on the daily events in Ukraine. This isn’t a clash between pro-government forces and anti-government activists. This is the next big phase of Washington’s plan to conquer the world, a plan that will inevitably pit Moscow against the amassed military power of the United States of America. This is David vs. Goliath, Mother Russia vs. the Great Satan, Vladie Putin vs. Comrade Wolf.</p>
<p>Ukraine is just Round 1.</p>

<p>China is an economic powerhouse. It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s second largest economy. It&#8217;s heading for number one status.</p>
<p>Perhaps sooner than most expect. It&#8217;s growth way outdistances America. It&#8217;s multiples greater.</p>
<p>Russia matches Washington&#8217;s military might. It does so in nuclear weapons strength. With sophisticated delivery systems.</p>
<p>Able to strike global targets accurately. With hugely destructive force. Enough to decimate potential adversaries. Perhaps to discourage potential aggression.</p>
<p>Russia is rich in what China needs most. Oil and gas mainly. Technological expertise. Industrial equipment. Sophisticated weapons.</p>
<p>Each nation is significant separately. They&#8217;re able to challenge America responsibly.</p>
<p>Together they&#8217;re a powerful combination. A force for world peace. For multi-polarity. For humanity. For weakening Washington&#8217;s imperium.</p>
<p>Sino-Russian ties stress unity. They&#8217;re strategically important. They&#8217;re stronger than ever in modern times.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re deepening. They expanding. Washington is increasingly concerned. It&#8217;s going all-out to subvert what weakens its strength.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s waging political, economic and cyberwar. It&#8217;s fighting a losing battle. Sino/Russian unity is odds on to prevail.</p>
<p>Especially with committed ties. With deepening ones. With stronger than ever ones.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Putin arrived in Shanghai. It&#8217;s China&#8217;s financial capital. He came to finalize a &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; trade deal. It&#8217;s enormously important.</p>
<p>It bonds both countries more closely together. It does so politically economically, commercially and militarily.</p>
<p>Both countries will trade increasingly in their own currencies. They&#8217;ll strengthen them. They&#8217;ll bypass dollar transactions. They&#8217;ll weaken it.</p>
<p>Russia will supply China with around 38 billion cubic million meters of natural gas annually. For the next 30 years.</p>
<p>It may double in size ahead. Depending on China&#8217;s internal needs.</p>
<p>Other increased trade was agreed on. In technological, industrial, and commercial sectors. In military hardware.</p>
<p>Growing Sino-Russian trade lessens reliance on increasingly undependable Western sources. It gives them less access to their markets.</p>
<p>Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping reject irresponsible US-led Western bashing. They called sanctions political tools.</p>
<p>They condemned &#8220;encouraging and financing&#8221; Washington&#8217;s regime change agenda.</p>
<p>The President of Russia&#8217;s web site <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/news/7199">headlined</a> &#8220;Russian-Chinese talks.&#8221; Both leaders met in Shanghai.</p>
<p>They &#8220;signed a <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/transcripts/7200">Joint Declaration</a> of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the new stage of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between the two countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>They &#8220;witnessed the signing of a package of intergovernmental, interdepartmental and commercial documents on cooperation in the economy, trade, energy and the humanitarian areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>They issued a joint statement. &#8220;(A)mbitious goals&#8221; were agreed on, it said. &#8220;(L)ong-term milestones&#8221; were established.</p>
<p>&#8220;(I)mportant bilateral documents&#8221; were signed. &#8220;Relations between Russia and the People’s Republic of China are developing successfully and have reached a new level of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation,&#8221; it stressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;(S)pecial attention (was on) economic issues. China is Russia&#8217;s leading foreign trade partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Sino/Russian Investment Committee was established. Its mandate is expanding economic and financial ties.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;diversifying trade.&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;reducing…dependence on global economic&#8221; conditions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s promoting cooperation in &#8220;technology-intensive areas.&#8221; They include industrial, commercial, banking and military areas.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re increasing bilateral ruble/renminbi trade. It bears repeating. Doing so bypasses dollar transactions. It weakens dollar strength.</p>
<p>Putin said &#8220;the historical memory of the great heroism of our peoples in World War II brings Russia and China even closer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both leaders agreed to hold joint celebrations. They&#8217;ll commemorate &#8220;the 70th anniversary of Victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other international issues were discussed. They include common geopolitical ones. Similar priorities are shared. Closer coordination is planned.</p>
<p>Sino/Russian unity, partnership and friendship were strengthened. It&#8217;s a &#8220;new stage&#8221; in &#8220;strategic relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strong bilateral relations are a force to be reckoned with. It promises to be more so ahead.</p>
<p>Moscow remains justifiably angry. It&#8217;s enraged about Washington elevating Kiev putschists to power. Rogue EU partners share blame.</p>
<p>Putin and Xi said crisis conditions can only be resolved diplomatically. They demand dialogue. They reject confrontation.</p>
<p>They &#8220;urged all Ukrainian regions and public and political groups to enter in broad nationwide talks…&#8221;</p>
<p>They want responsible governance. They want legitimate constitutional development.</p>
<p>They want &#8220;universally recognized rights and freedoms of people&#8221; observed.</p>
<p>Sergey Lavrov said Russian/EU/US-led NATO relations need fundamental reconsideration.</p>
<p>They require &#8220;essential rethinking,&#8221; he said. Disagreements must be resolved diplomatically, he stressed.</p>
<p>US-led NATO created Ukrainian crisis conditions. Russia targeting followed.</p>
<p>Western forces irresponsibly expand eastward. Encroaching on Russia&#8217;s borders threatens its heartland.</p>
<p>Bilateral relations are jeopardized. East/West confrontation is risked. So is world peace.</p>
<p>The road to Moscow runs through Kiev. Junta power has no legitimacy. Fundamental freedoms are targeted.</p>
<p>Eliminating them altogether is planned. Hardline rules runs things. Opposition isn&#8217;t tolerated.</p>
<p>Free expression is verboten. Putschists want their message alone getting out. They want vital truths suppressed.</p>
<p>Independent journalists aren&#8217;t safe. Russian LifeNews ones were targeted.</p>
<p>Oleg Sidyankin and Marat Saichenk were harassed. They were arrested. They&#8217;re detained. They&#8217;re held incommunicado.</p>
<p>Their lives potentially are endangered. They&#8217;re charged with &#8220;aiding terrorist groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>They released damning video images. They showed Kiev military forces using UN-marked attack helicopters against their own people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Air and ground assaults murder them in cold blood. Kiev wants this type information buried.</p>
<p>It wants reliable news sources eliminated. RT International&#8217;s stringer journalist Graham Phillips was arrested.</p>
<p>He explained by phone before silenced incommunicado, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m sitting at a blockade post in a portacabin. The dialogue is quite interrogation oriented.&#8221;</p>
<p>His car was searched. His laptop, equipment and personal belongings were confiscated.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment I’m with the Ukrainian forces…near Mariupol,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here for over two hours and I&#8217;ve been described, my status, as being detained in terms of I can&#8217;t leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would also say I&#8217;m being treated OK…I believe that someone is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve done checks on my documentation. They found my reports and clips I&#8217;ve done and they&#8217;re now looking through them asking me my position on things, asking if I&#8217;m a spy, and asking me quite thorough questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve checked all my documentation and photos, my laptop and the car. So that&#8217;s who I&#8217;m with at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was asked about separatism. About working with RT. He &#8220;describ(ed) (his) position on Crimea.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called its referendum legitimate. He stands by his position, he said.</p>
<p>He called Kiev&#8217;s government illegitimate. It &#8220;isn&#8217;t democratic. I don&#8217;t support this current situation in the east of Ukraine,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In Donetsk and Lugansk regions. He called attacking Eastern Ukrainians &#8220;completely wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, he &#8220;maintains complete objectivity and neutrality as a correspondent.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bulletproof jacket and helmet were confiscated. He’s unharmed so far, he said. Incommunicado since cut off there&#8217;s no way to know for sure.</p>
<p>Right Sector thugs targeted him. They put a bounty on his head. They offered $10,000 for his capture.</p>
<p>They called him a &#8220;Russian spy.&#8221; His life&#8217;s endanger in their hands. Or in sight to be shot in cold blood.</p>
<p>Radicalized Kiev elements posted a Facebook comment. He &#8220;works for terrorists,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;(H)e photographs and publishes the location of Ukrainian troops…&#8221;</p>
<p>He &#8220;spreads disinformation. (He publishes) Putin&#8217;s propaganda in the media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be immediately detained by Ukrainian forces ad deported from Ukraine.&#8221; Orders come from &#8220;EuroMaidan leaders,&#8221; it claimed.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s Foreign Ministry condemned his detention. Its human rights commissioner Konstantin Dolgov called it media obstruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is another step…made by Ukrainian authorities to curb the activities of unwanted journalists,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They &#8220;work professionally and show an objective picture, the ugly side of the outrages made by ultranationalists, the results of (Kiev putschists&#8217;) punitive operation in the southeast,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>Seizing Phillips constitutes an &#8220;unlawful seizure, detention of Russian journalists.&#8221; Moscow demands all lawlessly detained media representatives be released.</p>
<p>Kiev &#8220;continues its vicious line,&#8221; Dolgov added. Coup-appointed officials spurn their &#8220;international obligations concerning freedom of speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>They target media freedom. They want it eliminated altogether. They want their message alone reported. They want truth buried.</p>
<p>They want fascist putschist power enhanced. They deplore democratic values.</p>
<p>They want ordinary Ukrainians having no say. Polls show their popularity eroding. They risk losing it overwhelmingly.</p>
<p>Perhaps nationwide rebellion will follow. When ruthlessness exceeds levels too great to tolerate, all bets are off.</p>
<p>The only solution is nonviolent revolution. Perhaps just a matter of time. It can&#8217;t happen a moment too soon.</p>
