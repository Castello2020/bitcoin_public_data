<p>When the Syrian war jumped its borders into Iraq, surrounding nations had a perfect chance to peacefully cooperate. They’ve thus far refused. The war in Syria now seems to be shifting to Iraq, and the big actors in the regional drama are recklessly pushing events toward more conflict that could transform a regional proxy war into a direct multi-nation battle.</p>
<p>The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) now controls giant swaths of two nations, which are surrounded by countries that either fear ISIS or previously supported it. Old alliances are being tested as Syria and Iran come to the defense of the Iraqi government against ISIS, while the opposing alliance of U.S., Israel and the Gulf State monarchies are finding their unofficial union strained under the pressure of swelling paradoxes.</p>
<p>For example, the U.S. is supposedly fighting a war on terrorism, but has been in an unofficial military alliance with ISIS and other al-Qaeda groups in Syria, since all of them were actively waging war on the Syrian government.</p>
<p>When ISIS invaded Iraq the governments of Syria and Iran immediately offered assistance, while Obama stalled. Then, strangely, Obama’s Secretary of State <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-syria-may-have-launched-airstrikes-in-iraq/">John Kerry “warned” Syria</a> against air attacks targeting ISIS in Iraq, a move that was welcomed by the Iraqi government. Kerry’s warning was also meant for Iran, which is finding itself sucked deeper into the two-nation war that now threatens Iran’s border.</p>
<p>As Iraq, Syria and Iran are busy fighting ISIS, what are the U.S. and Israel doing? They are continuing their war against Syria, the war that gave ISIS a new lease on life.</p>
<p>Iraq begged Obama to deliver promised fighter jets to fight ISIS, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/world/middleeast/obama-seeks-500-million-to-train-and-equip-syrian-opposition.html?_r=0">Obama chose instead to give extra aid to the U.S. backed Syrian rebels</a>, to the tune of $500 million. The Syrian rebels have been completely dominated by Islamic extremists for at least two years.</p>
<p>Israel, for its part, also ignored ISIS and instead bombed nine Syrian military targets. Israel has bombed Syria several times in the last year, rather than bombing ISIS or the other al-Qaeda groups attacking Syria. In reality, an emerging regional war already exists, but is being minimized or ignored by the media.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-26/iraq-buys-used-russian-fighter-jets-amid-u-s-delivery-delay.html">Because the U.S. would rather fund Islamic extremists in Syria</a>, the Iraqi government requested and received fighter jets from Russia, which will inevitably create more strain between the Iraqi and U.S. governments, since giving and receiving military aid is a crucial way that countries cement alliances and exert influence.</p>
<p>When nations that receive military aid are disobedient, the big war toys are held back as a way to exert leverage. The Iraqi President, Nouri al-Maliki, let his political naivety blind him to this reality,<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28042302">and recently admitted that Iraq was “delusional” to rely completely on U.S. military aid</a>, since Obama is using the ISIS threat and the withholding of aid to pressure Iraqi politicians to ditch al-Maliki, essentially a “legal” form of regime change that will act more in accord with U.S. interests against Iran and Syria. Obama has wanted to replace al-Maliki ever since the Iraqi president refused to join Obama’s war against Syria.</p>
<p>As the Syria-Iraq war expands, the greater the gravitational pull it will exert on surrounding nations, who can’t resist the big profits associated with mass killing. Others will participate indirectly to protect their borders, until they too are drawn in by the centripetal forces of war.</p>
<p>After participating in the Syrian war through proxies like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the Obama administration finds itself neck deep in the Syrian-Iraqi blood bath, finding it difficult not to join the other sharks in the feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>Obama’s “hands off” approach to Iraq is temporary and strategic, and is in reality “hands on” behind the scenes.  As the war spreads across borders Obama will find it less possible to abstain, since Iran, Syria and Russia will gain wider regional influence at his expense, which is happening by the minute.</p>
<p>The Syria-Iraq war is testing the resilience of decades-long alliances, even the future of the modern nation state, which lies at the foundation of post-WWII international law. This legal sanctity of the nation-state was emphasized by the Nuremberg trials after WWII, which established that the Nazis biggest war crime was not genocide or the holocaust, but the military invasion of sovereign nations, which created the conditions for regional and world war. The only legal war under international law is a defensive one.</p>
<p>But now regional wars are becoming commonplace, and borders are ignored as big powers pay and arm proxy militias to attack governments. More importantly, the U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya have essentially eviscerated global international law, since the UN has been powerless in protecting sovereign nations against the aggression of the world’s only superpower. The U.S. invasions have created a climate where the nation-state has lost its revered status, increasing the likelihood of more war, since the old rules no longer apply.</p>
<p>Obama’s recent actions prove he has no intention of leaving the Middle East. As the Syrian war was spilling into Iraq, Obama requested $5 billion more for Middle East war, as if the gargantuan military budget wasn’t already enough. According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/world/middleeast/obama-seeks-500-million-to-train-and-equip-syrian-opposition.html?_r=0">The New York Times:</a></p>
<p>“The White House is asking for $4 billion to go to the Pentagon and $1 billion to the State Department for other counterterrorism operations, including training and equipping partner countries (Israel, Saudi Arabia, etc.). Some of the money, administration officials said, would cover increased costs of Special Operations Forces that have deployed around the world, while $1.5 billion would go toward counterterrorism efforts in the neighborhood around Syria: Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq.”</p>
<p>This $5 billion represents yet more blood money that will inevitably exacerbate the Middle East inferno. Years of ongoing U.S. military intervention — direct or indirect — has led to the unnecessary death or suffering of millions of people across the Middle East and to the large-scale destruction of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and now Iraq again.</p>
<p>It is possible, as some are predicting, that Obama will complete a major diplomatic deal that includes Iran and the Kurdish section of Iraq. This, if successful, may create a temporary reprieve from the violence, while creating new ethnic-religious tensions that will inevitably explode again.  Any temporary deal will not eliminate the deeper causes of the war, which lie in the waning influence of the U.S. and its allies, and the rising influence of China and Russia.</p>
<p>All these developments emphasize the need to revive the antiwar movement here in the U.S. Those who oppose U.S. government military adventures around the world should unite and demand that no troops be sent to Iraq, that the U.S. advisors in Iraq should be brought home, and that money should be spent on jobs, education and strengthening the safety net here at home, not on war.</p>

			<p style="color: #000000;">Imagine: you are dressed up for a night on Broadway, but your neighbours are involved in a vicious quarrel, and you have to gun up and deal with the trouble instead of enjoying a show, and a dinner, and perhaps a date. This was Putin’s position regarding the Ukrainian turmoil.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Russians have readjusted their sights, but they do not intend to bring their troops into the two rebel republics, unless dramatic developments should force them.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is not much fun to be in Kiev these days. The revolutionary excitement is over, and hopes for new faces, the end of corruption and economic improvement have withered. The Maidan street revolt and the subsequent coup just reshuffled the same marked deck of cards, forever rotating in power.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The new acting President has been an acting prime minister, and a KGB (called “SBU” in Ukrainian) supremo. The new acting prime minister has been a foreign minister. The oligarch most likely to be “elected” President in a few days has been a foreign minister, the head of the state bank, and personal treasurer of two coups, in 2004 (installing Yushchenko) and in 2014 (installing himself). His main competitor, Mme Timoshenko, served as a prime minister for years, until electoral defeat in 2010.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">These people had brought Ukraine to its present abject state. In 1991, the Ukraine was richer than Russia, today it is three times poorer because of these people’s mismanagement and theft. Now they plan an old trick: to take loans in Ukraine’s name, pocket the cash and leave the country indebted. They sell state assets to Western companies and ask for NATO to come in and protect the investment.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">They play a hard game, brass knuckles and all. The Black Guard, a new SS-like armed force of the neo-nazi Right Sector, prowls the land. They arrest or kill dissidents, activists, journalists. Hundreds of American soldiers, belonging to the “private” company Academi (formerly Blackwater) are spread out in Novorossia, the pro-Russian provinces in the East and South-East. IMF–dictated reforms slashed pensions by half and doubled the housing rents. In the market, US Army rations took the place of local food.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The new Kiev regime had dropped the last pretence of democracy by expelling the Communists from the parliament. This should endear them to the US even more. Expel Communists, apply for NATO, condemn Russia, arrange a gay parade and you may do anything at all, even fry dozens of citizens alive. And so they did.</p>
<div><a style="color: #d00000;" href="http://i0.wp.com/mycatbirdseat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Odessa.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-57378" src="http://i0.wp.com/mycatbirdseat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Odessa.jpg?resize=540%2C303" alt="Odessa" width="540" height="303" /></a></p>
</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">The harshest repressions were unleashed on industrial Novorossia, as its working class loathes the whole lot of oligarchs and ultra-nationalists. After the blazing inferno of Odessa and a wanton shooting on the streets of Melitopol the two rebellious provinces of Donetsk and Lugansk took up arms and declared their independence from the Kiev regime. They came under fire, but did not surrender. The other six Russian-speaking industrial provinces of Novorossia were quickly cowed. Dnepropetrovsk and Odessa were terrorised by personal army of Mr Kolomoysky; Kharkov was misled by its tricky governor.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Russia did not interfere and did not support the rebellion, to the great distress of Russian nationalists in Ukraine and Russia who mutter about “betrayal”. So much for the warlike rhetoric of McCain and Brzezinski.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin’s respect for others’ sovereignty is exasperating. I understand this sounds like a joke, — you hear so much about Putin as a “new Hitler”. As a matter of fact, Putin had legal training before joining the Secret Service. He is a stickler for international law. His Russia has interfered with other states much less than France or England, let alone the US. I asked his senior adviser, Mr Alexei Pushkov, why Russia did not try to influence Ukrainian minds while Kiev buzzed with American and European officials. “We think it is wrong to interfere”, he replied like a good Sunday schoolboy. It is rather likely Putin’s advisors misjudged public sentiment. « The majority of Novorossia’s population does not like the new Kiev regime, but being politically passive and conservative, will submit to its rule”, they estimated. “The rebels are a small bunch of firebrands without mass support, and they can’t be relied upon”, was their view. Accordingly, Putin advised the rebels to postpone the referendum indefinitely, a polite way of saying “drop it”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">They disregarded his request with considerable <em>sang froid</em> and convincingly voted <em>en masse</em> for secession from a collapsing Ukraine. The turnout was much higher than expected, the support for the move near total. As I was told by a Kremlin insider, this development was not foreseen by Putin’s advisers.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Perhaps the advisors had read it right, but three developments had changed the voters’ minds and had sent this placid people to the barricades and the voting booths:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>1. </strong>The first one was the fiery holocaust of Odessa, where the peaceful and carelessly unarmed demonstrating workers were suddenly attacked by regime’s thugs (the Ukrainian equivalent of Mubarak’s shabab) and corralled into the Trade Unions Headquarters. The building was set on fire, and the far-right pro-regime Black Guard positioned snipers to efficiently pick off would-be escapees. Some fifty, mainly elderly, Russian-speaking workers were burned alive or shot as they rushed for the windows and the doors. This dreadful event was turned into an occasion of merriment and joy by Ukrainian nationalists who referred to their slain compatriots as “fried beetles”. (It is being said that this auto-da-fé was organised by the shock troops of Jewish oligarch and strongman Kolomoysky, who coveted the port of Odessa. Despite his cuddly bear appearance, he is pugnacious and violent person, who offered ten thousand dollars for a captive Russian, dead or alive, and proposed a cool million dollars for the head of Mr Tsarev, a Member of Parliament from Donetsk.)</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>2. </strong>The second was the Mariupol attack on May 9, 2014. This day is commemorated as V-day in Russia and Ukraine (while the West celebrates it on May 8). The Kiev regime forbade all V-day celebrations. In Mariupol, the Black Guard attacked the peaceful and weaponless town, burning down the police headquarters and killing local policemen who had refused to suppress the festive march. Afterwards, Black Guard thugs unleashed armoured vehicles on the streets, killing citizens and destroying property.</p>
<p><a style="color: #d00000;" href="http://i2.wp.com/mycatbirdseat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Merkel-and-Nuland.jpg"><img class="wp-image-58966" src="http://i2.wp.com/mycatbirdseat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Merkel-and-Nuland.jpg?resize=400%2C225" alt="&quot;That would be Great to help Glue this thing...And you know Fuck the EU&quot; --American Diplomat, Asst. Secretary of State Nuland caught on tape." width="400" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The West did not voice any protest; Nuland and Merkel weren’t horrified by this mass murder, as they were by Yanukovich’s timid attempts to control crowds.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The people of these two provinces felt abandoned; they understood that nobody was going to protect and save them but themselves, and went off to vote.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">3. The third development was, bizarrely, the Eurovision jury choice of Austrian transvestite Conchita Wurst for a winner of its song contest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The sound-minded Novorossians decided they want no part of such a Europe.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Actually, the people of Europe do not want it either:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It <a style="color: #d00000;" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/eurovision-2014-voting-controversy-after-uk-jury-revealed-to-place-conchita-first--but-british-public-voted-for-donatan--cleo-9351644.html">transpired</a> that the majority of British viewers preferred a Polish duo, Donatan &amp; Cleo, with its <em>We Are Slavic</em>. Donatan is half Russian, and has courted controversy in the past extolling the virtues of pan-Slavism and the achievements of the Red Army, says the <em>Independent</em>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The politically correct judges of the jury preferred to “celebrate tolerance”, the dominant paradigm imposed upon Europe.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is the second transvestite to win this very political contest; the first one was Israeli singer Dana International.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Such obsession with re-gendering did not go down well with Russians and/or Ukrainians.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Russians have readjusted their sights, but they do not intend to bring their troops into the two rebel republics, unless dramatic developments should force them.<em><br />

<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>RUSSIAN PLANS<br />

</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">Imagine: you are dressed up for a night on Broadway, but your neighbours are involved in a vicious quarrel, and you have to gun up and deal with the trouble instead of enjoying a show, and a dinner, and perhaps a date. This was Putin’s position regarding the Ukrainian turmoil.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A few months ago, Russia had made a huge effort to become, and to be seen as, a very civilized European state of the first magnitude. This was the message of the Sochi <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/02/21/the-attacks-on-the-sochi-games/">Olympic games</a>: to re-brand, even re-invent Russia, just as Peter the Great once had, as part of the First World; an amazing country of strong European tradition, of Leo Tolstoy and Malevich, of Tchaikovsky and Diaghilev, the land of arts, of daring social reform, of technical achievements, of modernity and beyond — the Russia of Natasha Rostova riding a Sikorsky ‘copter. Putin spent $60 billion to broadcast this image.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The old fox Henry Kissinger wisely <a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2014/05/10/kissinger-putin-likely-didnt-plan-to-bring-ukraine-situation-to-a-head/">said</a>:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin spent $60 billion on the Olympics. They had opening and closing ceremonies, trying to show Russia as a normal progressive state. So it isn’t possible that he, three days later, would voluntarily start an assault on Ukraine. There is no doubt that… at all times he wanted Ukraine in a subordinate position. And at all times, every senior Russian that I’ve ever met, including dissidents like Solzhenitsyn and Brodsky, looked at Ukraine as part of the Russian heritage. But I don’t think he had planned to bring it to a head now.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, Washington hawks decided to do whatever it takes to keep Russia out in the cold. They were afraid of this image of “a normal progressive state” as such Russia would render NATO irrelevant and undermine European dependence on the US. They were adamant about retaining their hegemony, shattered as it was by the <a href="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/TheCape.htm">Syrian confrontation</a>. They attacked Russian positions in the Ukraine and arranged a violent coup, <a href="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/BrownRevolution.htm">installing a viciously anti-Russian regime</a> supported by football fans and neo-Nazis, paid for by Jewish oligarchs and American taxpayers. The victors banned the Russian language and prepared to void treaties with Russia regarding its Crimean naval base at Sebastopol on the Black Sea. This base was to become a great new NATO base, controlling the Black Sea and threatening Russia.</p>
<p>Putin had to deal quickly and so he did, by <a href="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/PutinsTriumph.htm">accepting the Crimean people’s</a> request to join Russian Federation. This dealt with the immediate problem of the base, but the problem of Ukraine remained.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Ukraine is not a foreign entity to Russians, it is the western half of Russia. It was artificially separated from the rest in 1991, at the collapse of the USSR. The people of the two parts are interconnected by family, culture and blood ties; their economies are intricately connected. While a separate viable Ukrainian state is a possibility, an “independent” Ukrainian state hostile to Russia is not viable and can’t be tolerated by any Russian ruler. And this for military as well as for cultural reasons: if Hitler had begun the war against Russia from its present border, he would have taken Stalingrad in two days and would have destroyed Russia in a week.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A more pro-active Russian ruler would have sent troops to Kiev a long time ago. Thus did Czar Alexis when the Poles, Cossacks and Tatars argued for it in 17<sup>th</sup> century. So also did Czar Peter the Great, when the Swedes occupied it in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. So did Lenin, when the Germans set up the Protectorate of Ukraine (he called its establishment “the obscene peace”). So did Stalin, when the Germans occupied the Ukraine in 1941.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin still hopes to settle the problem by peaceful means, relying upon the popular support of the Ukrainian people. Actually, before the Crimean takeover, the majority of Ukrainians (and near all Novorossians) overwhelmingly supported some sort of union with Russia. Otherwise, the Kiev coup would not have been necessary. The forced Crimean takeover seriously undermined Russian appeal. The people of Ukraine did not like it. This was foreseen by the Kremlin, but they had to accept Crimea for a few reasons. Firstly, a loss of Sevastopol naval base to NATO was a too horrible of an alternative to contemplate. Secondly, the Russian people would not understand if Putin were to refuse the suit of the Crimeans.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Washington hawks still hope to force Putin to intervene militarily, as it would give them the opportunity to isolate Russia, turn it into a monster pariah state, beef up defence spending and set Europe and Russia against each other. They do not care about Ukraine and Ukrainians, but use them as pretext to attain geopolitical goals.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Europeans would like to fleece Ukraine; to import its men as “illegal” workers and its women as prostitutes, to strip assets, to colonise. They did it with Moldova, a little sister of Ukraine, the most miserable ex-Soviet Republic. As for Russia, the EU would not mind taking it down a notch, so they would not act so grandly. But the EU is not fervent about it. Hence, the difference in attitudes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin would prefer to continue with his modernisation of Russia. The country needs it badly. The infrastructure lags twenty or thirty years behind the West. Tired by this backwardness, young Russians often prefer to move to the West, and this brain drain causes much damage to Russia while enriching the West. Even Google is a result of this brain drain, for Sergey Brin is a Russian immigrant as well. So are hundreds of thousands of Russian scientists and artists manning every Western lab, theatre and orchestra. Political liberalisation is not enough: the young people want good roads, good schools and a quality of life comparable to the West. This is what Putin intends to deliver.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He is doing a fine job of it. Moscow now has free bikes and Wi-Fi in the parks like every Western European city. Trains have been upgraded. Hundreds of thousands of apartments are being built, even more than during the Soviet era. Salaries and pensions have increased seven-to-tenfold in the past decade. Russia is still shabby, but it is on the right track. Putin wants to continue this modernisation.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As for the Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states, Putin would prefer they retain their independence, be friendly and work at a leisurely pace towards integration a la the European Union.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He does not dream of a new empire. He would reject such a proposal, as it would delay his modernisation plans.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">If the beastly neocons would not have forced his hand by expelling the legitimate president of Ukraine and installing their puppets, the world might have enjoyed a long spell of peace.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But then the western military alliance under the US leadership would fall into abeyance, US military industries would lose out, and US hegemony would evaporate. Peace is not good for the US military and hegemony-creating media machine. So dreams of peace in our lifetime are likely to remain just dreams.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What will Putin do?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin will try to avoid sending in troops as long as possible. He will have to protect the two splinter provinces, but this can be done with remote support, the way the US supports the rebels in Syria, without ‘boots on the ground’. Unless serious bloodshed on a large scale should occur, Russian troops will just stand by, staring down the Black Guard and other pro-regime forces.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin will try to find an arrangement with the West for sharing authority, influence and economic involvement in the failed state. This can be done through federalisation, or by means of coalition government, or even partition. The Russian-speaking provinces of Novorossia are those of Kharkov (industry), Nikolayev (ship-building), Odessa (harbour), Donetsk and Lugansk (mines and industry), Dnepropetrovsk (missiles and high-tech), Zaporozhe (steel), Kherson (water for Crimea and ship-building), all of them established, built and populated by Russians. They could secede from Ukraine and form an independent Novorossia, a mid-sized state, but still bigger than some neighbouring states. This state could join the Union State of Russia and Belarus, and/or the Customs Union led by Russia. The rump Ukraine could manage as it sees fit until it decides whether or not to join its Slavic sisters in the East. Such a set up would produce two rather cohesive and homogeneous states.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Another possibility (much less likely at this moment) is a three-way division of the failed Ukraine: Novorossia, Ukraine proper, and Galicia&amp;Volyn. In such a case, Novorossia would be strongly pro-Russian, Ukraine would be neutral, and Galicia strongly pro-Western.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The EU could accept this, but the US probably would not agree to any power-sharing in the Ukraine. In the ensuing tug-of-war, one of two winners will emerge. If Europe and the US drift apart, Russia wins. If Russia accepts a pro-Western positioning of practically all of Ukraine, the US wins. The tug-of-war could snap and cause all-out war, with many participants and a possible use of nuclear weapons. This is a game of chicken; the one with stronger nerves and less imagination will remain on the track.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Pro and Contra</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is too early to predict who will win in the forthcoming confrontation. For the Russian president, it is extremely tempting to take all of Ukraine or at least Novorossia, but it is not an easy task, and one likely to cause much hostility from the Western powers. With Ukraine incorporated, Russian recovery from 1991 would be completed, its strength doubled, its security ensured and a grave danger removed. Russia would become great again. People would venerate Putin as Gatherer of Russian Lands.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, Russian efforts to appear as a modern peaceful progressive state would have been wasted; it would be seen as an aggressor and expelled from international bodies. Sanctions will bite; high tech imports may be banned, as in the Soviet days. The Russian elites are reluctant to jeopardize their good life. The Russian military just recently began its modernization and is not keen to fight yet, perhaps not for another ten years.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But if they feel cornered, if NATO moves into Eastern Ukraine, they will fight all the same.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Some Russian politicians and observers believe that Ukraine is a basket case; its problems would be too expensive to fix. This assessment has a ‘sour grapes’ aftertaste, but it is widespread. An interesting new voice on the web, The Saker, <a href="http://vineyardsaker.blogspot.ru/2014/05/a-look-in-long-distance-who-will-have.html">promotes this view</a>. “Let the EU and the US provide for the Ukrainians, they will come back to Mother Russia when hungry”, he says. The problem is, they will not be allowed to reconsider. The junta did not seize power violently in order to lose it at the ballot box.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Besides, Ukraine is not in such bad shape as some people claim. Yes, it would cost trillions to turn it into a Germany or France, but that’s not necessary. Ukraine can reach the Russian level of development very quickly –- in union with Russia. Under the EC-IMF-NATO, Ukraine <em>will</em> become a basket case, if it’s not already. The same is true for all East European ex-Soviet states: they can modestly prosper with Russia, as Belarus and Finland do, or suffer depopulation, unemployment, poverty with Europe and NATO and against Russia, <em>vide</em> Latvia, Hungary, Moldova, Georgia. It is in Ukrainian interests to join Russia in some framework; Ukrainians understand that; for this reason they will not be allowed to have democratic elections.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Simmering Novorossia has a potential to change the game. If Russian troops don’t come in, Novorossian rebels may beat off the Kiev offensive and embark on a counter-offensive to regain the whole of the country, despite Putin’s pacifying entreaties. Then, in a full-blown civil war, the Ukraine will hammer out its destiny.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">On a personal level, Putin faces a hard choice. Russian nationalists will not forgive him if he surrenders Ukraine without a fight. The US and EU threaten the very life of the Russian president, as their sanctions are hurting Putin’s close associates, encouraging them to get rid of or even assassinate the President and improve their relations with the mighty West. War may come at any time, as it came twice during the last century – though Russia tried to avoid it both times. Putin wants to postpone it, at the very least, but not at any price.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">His is not an easy choice. As Russia procrastinates, as the US doubles the risks, the world draws nearer to the nuclear abyss. Who will chicken out?</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Few would expect a survivor of the Holocaust to be the face of genocide denial. Imagine the surprise of Suffolk Law School’s student body when its administration’s chosen commencement speaker turned out to be just that.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Abraham Foxman, the long-time director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization dedicated to eradicating anti-Semitism and bigotry and protecting civil rights, seems a figure beyond reproach. Yet Foxman has invited controversy to Suffolk University for his unwillingness to recognize the 1915 Armenian Genocide &#8211; an event which saw an estimated 1.5 million Armenians massacred by the Turks &#8211; and his campaign to defeat Congressional acknowledgement of said genocide.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Criticism of Foxman has centered on this disconnect, that a man who lived through the attempted extermination of an entire race now denies that truth of another. Many at Suffolk are unwilling to participate in that hypocrisy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Suffolk’s Students Speak Out</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Shortly after Foxman was announced as their 2014 speaker, Suffolk Law students <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2014%2F04%2F21%2Fsome-suffolk-students-criticize-choice-adl-leader-abraham-foxman-law-school-commencement-speaker%2FAEvvrb6dYabiYNOliYmZiN%2Fstory.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4FNY3H8izw16kHqjimxPNPJ6hmA" target="_blank">rejected the decision</a>. Amy Willis, President of the university’s National Lawyers Guild chapter, told the Boston Globe that “Suffolk claims to embody diversity and be a place for all people, but this clearly is a speaker who does not embody those values.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This stance was reflected in <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.change.org%2Fpetitions%2Fpresident-james-mccarthy-remove-adl-director-abe-foxman-as-suffolk-law-s-2014-commencement-speaker&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmq997oOF_fGcmbAhi8aPS1llc3w" target="_blank">a petition to remove Foxman</a> as the keynote speaker, as well as to deny him the honorary Juris doctorate he is slated to receive. The petition states that Foxman’s presence “not only insults students and their families, but also insults the very foundation of Suffolk Law as a safe place of diversity and acceptance.” As arguments for his removal, the petition enumerates Foxman’s refusal to explicitly label the Armenian Genocide as a genocide as well as his support for <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Farticles%2F2013%2F04%2F29%2Fabe-foxman-rationalizes-blanket-spying-on-american-muslims.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOUZxFH00m9ddv9zQ7Tv9tl68RcQ" target="_blank">racial profiling of Muslim-Americans</a> in the interest of “national security.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>What Is Genocide?</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Raphael Lemkin coined the term “genocide” in 1944 to describe the magnitude of premeditated racial extermination, citing <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCebMq-GmH4" target="_blank">what happened to the Armenians</a> as the prime example. After the war, the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genocidescholars.org%2Fresources%2Fabout-genocide&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVTI-pdcJn_c4mcV8BZ3nHJddRuw" target="_blank">establishing genocide as an international crime</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In the Convention, genocide is defined as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” which includes “killing members of the group” and “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The mention of “intent” is significant in this definition. Foxman’s 2007 statement (described below) would go out of its way to avoid labeling the Turkish pogrom as intentional, admitting only that its “consequences” were “tantamount” to genocide. To the casual observer, it is perhaps a negligible distinction. From a legal standpoint, it is strategically evasive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>What Is the Armenian Genocide?</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This definition applies to the systematic slaughter of Armenians by the Turkish government that began in 1915. To understand how this genocide came to be, a brief summary of the two nations’ history is required.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Existing in various forms for approximately 3,000 years of recorded history, Armenia was the first nation to declare Christianity its national religion. It remained Christian under the several empires that conquered it, including the Muslim caliphate of the Ottoman Turks. From the 15th century onward, Armenians and their fellow “infidels” were allowed to continue their religious practices, though subjected to higher taxes, fewer rights and ethnic discrimination. For the Armenians, this culminated in the Hamidian Massacres of 1894-1897. This state-sponsored pogrom was instituted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in retaliation for Armenians’ attempts to win civil rights.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By the start of World War I, political tensions between Armenians and a new Turkish government were even more strained. Armenia itself had been divided by warring empires, with Russia claiming the east and Turkey claiming the west. Duty-bound, both sides fought for their respective empires.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This dichotomy of loyalty enabled the Turks to concoct a pretext that veiled their ultimate goal of an ethnically and religiously uniform empire. A purge would enable them to <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armenian-genocide.org%2Fchronology.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_noTfzxOnV1l2a2NixiNCXCP-gg" target="_blank">“liquidate”</a> the “Christian element” and seize the wealth and property of suspected insurgents. On April 24, 1915, the Turkish government authorized the arrest and execution of several hundred Armenian intellectuals. From that point, the executions would continue for eight years, shrouded under the fog of the Great War.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Turkish soldiers and mercenaries acting under the general outfit of “Special Operations” murdered hundreds of thousands of Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks, marching them through the Anatolian and Syrian deserts without food, water or clothing. “Infidels” not sentenced to hard labor camps were drowned in rivers, thrown off cliffs, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genocide-museum.am%2Feng%2Fonline_exhibition_6.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7z9EthV9wnjxIb8g4zVa4FHOazw" target="_blank">crucified</a> and burned alive. Property was seized, women were raped and dispatched to Turkish harems, and many children were kidnapped and forcibly converted to Islam.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The number of survivors is a matter of debate, but of a population of 2 million indigenous Armenians, it is estimated that upwards of 1.5 million were slaughtered in Turkey between 1915 and 1923. Even today, almost a century later, the Euphrates River is filled with the bones of dead Armenians, as author Peter Balakian, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2008%2F12%2F07%2Fmagazine%2F07lives-t.html%3F_r%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqWmK3E0TiLrjQq33rjHRbRcM52g" target="_blank">writing for the New York Times magazine</a>, can attest.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Stark, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armenian-genocide.org%2Fphoto_wegner_view.html%3Fphoto%3Ddoorstep.jpg%26collection%3Dwegner%26caption%3DYoung%2Bboy%2Bdies%2Bon%2Bdoorstep&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_zNaUR5b7FI-XKNZT6xta7ikq2w" target="_blank">horrific images</a> exist to document the savagery of the Armenian massacre. Yet still Turkey denies its own legacy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Turkey and Foxman’s Denials</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Article 301 of the Turkish penal code <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldpoliticsreview.com%2Farticles%2F517%2Fhrant-dink-silenced-in-the-shadow-of-turkeys-penal-code-301&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBpkWpxHc3GNFaEhBBBrdio_GQSw" target="_blank">makes it illegal</a> to insult Turkey, the Turkish nation or the Turkish government. To acknowledge an “Armenian Genocide” is the most egregious insult possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Because Turkey was the first nation in the Middle East to establish diplomatic relations with Israel and remains an instrumental ally of the West, the United States is unwilling to rock that political boat. Even when a resolution was proposed by the 110th Congress to recognize the Armenian Genocide, then President George W. Bush publicly opposed the measure. He was not the first, and current President Barack Obama’s silence on the issue suggests he will not be the last.</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zflmBNjHfAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And this has been <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salon.com%2F2010%2F06%2F16%2Fisrael_lobby_genocide_armenia%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVOK4suS51HRJvpk02rNhAFsRgrw" target="_blank">Abraham Foxman’s dilemma</a>. His public opposition to Armenian recognition has been out of loyalty to Israel. “Our focus is Israel,” he has said. “If helping Turkey helps Israel, then that’s what we’re in the business of doing.” It seems absurd to the point of tragedy that a man who lived under Nazi oppression can answer the question of Armenian genocide with, “It was wartime. Things get messy.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But in 2007, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Farticles%2F2007%2F08%2F22%2Fadl_chief_bows_to_critics%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBW_ewx184FxE85usCF-thG7iELg" target="_blank">Foxman tried to pacify his critics</a>. Speaking for himself and the ADL, he stated that, “We have never negated but have always described the painful events of 1915-1918 perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire against Armenians as massacres and atrocities,” ending with decision that “the consequences of those actions were indeed tantamount to genocide.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But “tantamount to genocide” without intent is not genocide. This calculated elision of “intent,” its palpable absence, is an insult to the Armenian community. The ADL’s defenders decry this as splitting hairs, but they overlook the importance of legacy and how powerfully a single word can affect it. It was important enough to prompt a dozen Massachusetts cities to pull out of the ADL’s “No Place for Hate” anti-bias program. It was important enough that when Andrew H. Tarsy, a regional director for the ADL, acknowledged the genocide <i>as </i>true genocide, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Farticles%2F2007%2F08%2F18%2Fadl_local_leader_fired_on_armenian_issue%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiHHlBKEfC2WPMkdffAxm1xlhjmg" target="_blank">he was promptly fired from the organization</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately for Suffolk Law School, and all those who expect the ADL to uphold its own morality, Abraham Foxman represents a willful blindness &#8211; to look the other way on a hundred-year-old crime &#8211; for the sake of political expediency.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is the opinion of Suffolk University President James McCarthy that Foxman, despite students’ protests, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fforward.com%2Farticles%2F196952%2Fabraham-foxman-to-speak-at-boston-graduation-despi%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKRjljLhySVUhafaMD46QWYAGqWg" target="_blank">“is well deserving of recognition.”</a> Moreover, it is the University’s hope that Foxman’s “life of public service will inspire our graduates as they embark on their professional careers.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This does beg the question of what recognition the Syrian desert’s uncounted dead deserve, or what their lives may have inspired, but the answers are unlikely to be found in Foxman’s commencement speech.</p>

After two fair and lengthy hearings, the eight elected members of the Massachusetts Governor’s Council, in a 4-4 tie vote on March 5, refused to confirm attorney Joseph Berman to be a Superior Court judge.  It was a defeat for Governor Deval Patrick, who had nominated Mr. Berman.  But the Council took its responsibilities seriously and rendered a well-considered judgment.</p>
<p>Councilors voiced many concerns about the nominee.  Foremost was a lack of truthfulness.</p>
<p>Berman, under oath, was asked three times whether he had requested anyone to lobby the Council to advance his nomination.  Each time, he replied no.</p>
<p>Later, after some stumbling, he admitted to another Councilor that he had phoned State Senator – now Congresswoman – Katherine Clark to lobby Councilors.</p>
<p>Mr. Berman’s meager criminal trial experience also troubled Councilors. Another concern was Berman’s scant knowledge of drug abuse.  And some worried that Berman, politically active and a national leader in the heavily political Anti-Defamation League (ADL), would promote those viewpoints as a judge.</p>
<p>Several Councilors questioned Berman’s $100,000 in campaign contributions, including to Governor Patrick, since being turned down for a judgeship in 2004.  They saw this as a possible attempt to advance his judicial ambitions.</p>
<p>At his second hearing, Mr. Berman tried to deflect these criticisms.  He claimed, for example, to have misunderstood the Councilors’ questions about lobbying them. He also said he had been studying up on drug addiction and criminal law.</p>
<p>Berman’s being a 19-year member, and since 2006 a National Commissioner, of the ADL also caught the attention of some Councilors and media.</p>
<p>Recall the ADL scandal that broke out in mid-2007.  It exposed that organization’s decades-old hypocrisy in denying the Armenian genocide and colluding directly with Turkey, a major human rights violator, to defeat U.S. Congressional resolutions on that genocide.</p>
<p>Shocked at the ADL’s stance, the Massachusetts Municipal Association, which represents every city and town, then dropped its sponsorship of the ADL’s so-called “No Place for Hate” anti-bias program.  So did Arlington, Bedford, Belmont, Lexington, Medford, Needham, Newburyport, Newton, Northampton, Peabody, Somerville, Watertown, and Westwood.  The ADL scandal quickly became national and international news.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Governor’s Council quizzed Berman about his ADL leadership role.  He claimed that after the scandal erupted in 2007 he and some New England ADL members tried to convince the National ADL to change its position on the Armenian genocide.   But there is no hard proof of that.  And surely Berman knew long before 2007 of the ADL’s anti-Armenian stance.  Yet he never spoke out publicly or resigned. Even after 2007, Mr. Berman remained publicly silent about the ADL’s indefensible assault on Armenian Americans.</p>
<p>Alongside the Council’s other concerns, Berman’s ADL record raised doubts about his worthiness to be a judge.</p>
<p>On August 21, 2007, the National ADL tried to squirm out of the scandal with a press release that used deceptive and legalistic wording about the Armenian genocide.  It implied that the Armenian genocide was a mere “consequence” of wartime events, which meant it wouldn’t qualify as genocide under the United Nation’s official definition.  The dishonest ADL declaration was widely rejected.</p>
<p>Nearly 20 countries, such as Canada, France, and Argentina, the European Union Parliament, the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and the Polish Jewish lawyer who coined the word “genocide” in the 1940s, Raphael Lemkin, have recognized the Armenian genocide of 1915 -23 committed by Turkey.</p>
<p>Many American human rights, ethnic, and church organizations have supported the Armenian genocide resolution.  These include the American Jewish World Service and the Jewish War Veterans of the USA.</p>
<p>But not the ADL nor, reports the Jewish media, the American Jewish Committee, AIPAC, and B’nai B’rith.  They adhere to a long-standing arrangement among themselves, Turkey, and Israel to deny the Armenian genocide.  See “History of Lobbying” at <a href="http://NoPlaceForDenial.com">NoPlaceForDenial.com</a>.</p>
<p>The ADL professes to defend the human rights of all ethnic groups, not just Jews. It insists that the American people acknowledge and pass legislation on the Holocaust.  Yet the ADL tries to prevent recognition of a Christian genocide.  The hypocrisy is astonishing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a significant precedent has been created: Members of the ADL, or similar organizations, who aspire to a higher post, particularly in government, may now be asked what they knew of their organization’s genocide hypocrisy, when they knew it, and what they did about it.  Such are the bitter fruits of deceit.</p>

<p>The psychopathic propaganda power brokers are inciting hysteria over expanding their Ukrainian coup operation. Pushing Russia to accept a hostile empire on their border is irrational. Belligerence and intimidation makes indefensible foreign affairs relationships. Those who swallow the &#8220;wag the dog&#8221; script that circulates in the Western mainstream media, deceived or brainwashed, are incapable of any independent thought. The forces that seek unremitting interventionist intrusions that thrive on self-induced chaos are the true threats to world peace.</p>
<p>Until the perception and experience of the intrepid Michael Scheuer becomes universally accepted, the failed foreign policy mistakes will continue as seen in <a href="http://non-intervention.com/1181/russia-annexing-crimea-is-the-cost-of-u-s-eu-intervention-in-ukraine/">Russia annexing Crimea is the cost of U.S.-EU intervention in Ukraine</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Overall, U.S. and Western leaders should be lining up to thank Vladimir Putin for a painful but thorough lesson in how the adult leader of a nation protects his country’s genuine national interests. And, it must be noted, Putin is not teaching rocket science. Had Western leaders received a decent education — especially in the fields of history and human nature — they would have been absolutely certain from the start that any destabilizing Western intervention in Ukraine that even remotely threatened Russia’s assured access to its Crimean naval bases would provoke precisely the kind of Russian response that occurred. They also would have known that West and the UN could bleat forever about the requirements of various treaties and international law, but that a nation acting to protect what it perceives to be life-or-death national interests — as is Putin’s Russia — is both insane and suicidal if it refrains from acting because of a raft of documents designed to address Cold War conditions that no longer exist.</p>
<p>The lesson of the Ukraine crisis — if it ends without war — for the U.S. and the EU will be crystal clear: Hoe your own row, and mind your own business. If it ends in a civil or European war, they will have only themselves to blame.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>With the results from the Crimean referendum in hand the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/crimea-referendum-explainer-ukraine-russia">Guardian</a> newspaper reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The referendum ballot itself, as posted a few days ago to the parliament&#8217;s website, doesn&#8217;t exactly give voters an option to say &#8220;No&#8221;. The two choices are:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you support joining Crimea with the Russian Federation as a subject of Russia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you support restoration of the 1992 Crimean constitution, and Crimea&#8217;s status as part of Ukraine?</p></blockquote>
<p>This second option is somewhat contradictory: the 1992 constitution asserts Crimea is an independent state and not part of Ukraine (reference to autonomy within Ukraine was inserted at a later date). By &#8220;supporting the restoration of the 1992 constitution&#8221; voters will actually support enhanced autonomy. No matter what, voters are ticking a box for independence from Ukraine.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the inimitable and immortal words of that heroine of all <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/03/13/3094109/apnewsbreak-transgender-troop.html">transgender</a> sociopaths, the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton sums up the double standard: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka0_nz53CcM">What Difference Does It Make?</a> The bipartisan support for an unbalanced death wish to jump-start the DEFCON alert level, reflected in the comments of <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/gen-dempsey-us-ready-for-military-response-to-russia-if-crimean-conflict-escalates-339144.html">General Dempsey: US ready for military response to Russia if Crimean conflict escalates</a>, should alarm everyone. “We do have treaty obligations with our NATO allies. And I have assured them that if that treaty obligation is triggered [in Europe], we would respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a listing of reports on Lessons of the Ukrainian Coup, examine the latest <a href="http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=1f36c52155dbd59aea0b01d76&amp;id=2816c363ed&amp;e=ed5705a7ca">BATR RealPolitik Newsletter &#8211; March 13, 2014</a>. Especially appreciate the Robert Parry article, <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/02/23/neocons-and-the-ukraine-coup/">Neocons and the Ukraine Coup</a>, which targets the perverse mentality of the NeoCon influence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now, you have Assistant Secretary of State Nuland, the wife of prominent neocon Robert Kagan, acting as a leading instigator in the Ukrainian unrest, explicitly seeking to pry the country out of the Russian orbit. Last December, she reminded Ukrainian business leaders that, to help Ukraine achieve “its European aspirations, we have invested more than $5 billion.” She said the U.S. goal was to take “Ukraine into the future that it deserves.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Any attempt to establish sanity in foreign policy must recognize that the betrayers within have sold out America for the last century. Foggy Bottom is the depository of dual loyalists as explained in the Totalitarian Collectivism essay, <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/02/23/neocons-and-the-ukraine-coup/">The State Department&#8217;s New World Order Agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Just who are the maniacal lunatics that drive this insatiable need to threaten continuous war to achieve global imperium? One needs not be a Putin booster to recognize that the post 911 expansions of a garrison mentality guarantees further military expeditions into the internal affairs of any country that bucks the “international community” New World Order goals.</p>
<div align="center">

<p>Author of the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-American-Empire-Rodrigue-Tremblay/dp/0741418878/ref=sr_11_1/104-8428100-2298348?ie=UTF8">The New American Empire</a>”, Rodrigue Tremblay exposes the lunacy behind <a href="http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2014/03/06/the-bush-obama-s-neocon-foreign-policy-o">The Bush-Obama&#8217;s Neocon Foreign Policy of Isolating Russia and of Expanding NATO is a Dismal Failure</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“President Barack Obama was candid in admitting it on Monday March 3, 2014, when he said that &#8220;we are indicating to the Russians [that] if in fact they continue on the current trajectory they’re on, then we are examining a whole series of steps — economic, diplomatic— that will isolate Russia.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it is precisely this desire to expand NATO and to isolate Russia by incorporating all the countries bordering Russia into NATO, i.e. a strategy of geopolitical and military encirclement of Russia, which has provoked that country when it felt threatened in its national security.</p>
<p>The truth is that NATO should have been disbanded after the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991, and especially after the Warsaw Pact was itself dismantled . . . But no! The United States wanted to take advantage of the situation and demanded that everything fell into the military-financial U.S. Empire.”</p>
<p>The Global Gulag essay, <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/021203.html">NATO a Dinosaur Overdue for Extinction</a>, amplifies upon this conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the breakdown in NATO is destined to avail an opportunity to curtail the Yankee Hyperpower, the alternative need not be the formation of another suspect alliance. It is not unpatriotic to advocate the wisdom in an America First policy. NATO doesn’t secure an advance for our country, but only provides the military command and enforcement that imposes the will of global masters. Resistance and opposition against an independent EU rapid defense force, comes not from the nations of Europe, but from the elites that control the mechanisms of global power. NATO is one of their tools. Alliances are one of their methods. And suppression of viable self determination is their cherished goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Just think what the response would be if Putin reacted to the bellicose threats from EU/NATO/US to intervene into whatever geographic Ukraine composition remains, by re-creating Russian bases in the Western hemisphere? Venezuela becoming the 21th Century Cuba cannot stand. You can hear the cries – no Russian Guantánamo Bay bases in our backyard.</p>
<p>The impotency of superpower status means that the nuclear option becomes executable. This attitude is pure madness, and leads to unilateral imperialism.</p>
<p>When the formidable voice of moral authority, Paul Craig Roberts, warns about <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/03/14/world-war-1-paul-craig-roberts/">World War 1 All Over Again</a>, the nation must come to grips with the fact that the establishment political class is hell bent on running the world by whatever means they decide as they undertake to eliminate any and all opposition to their brinkmanship of NWO jingoism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did US Secretary of State John Kerry ask you before he delivered an all or nothing ultimatum to Russia? Did he ask Congress? Did he ask the countries of western and eastern Europe–NATO members who Kerry has committed to whatever the consequences will be of Washington’s inflexible, arrogant, aggressive provocation of Russia, a well-armed nuclear power? Did Kerry ask Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico, South America, Africa, China, Central Asia, all of whom would be adversely affected by a world war provoked by the crazed criminals in Washington?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Absent from a sober and balanced national policy, on what is truly best for the American people, is recognition that the internationalism fostered by Woodrow Wilson has destroyed the Republic. <a href="http://batr.org/americafirst.html">America First</a> requires the acceptance and courage to admit that the globalist coup d&#8217;état, which actually took over and now rules our own country, is the definitive enemy of all humanity.</p>
<p>The treason of the NeoCons and International Libs promote a satanic cosmology, which seeks to destroy any traditional institutional legacy that George Washington elaborated in his <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp">Farewell Address</a>. Risking World War III over Ukraine, especially when the forces of globalism initiated the unrest, is sheer folly.</p>
<p>If there are any real Patriots left in positions of authority within the Federal government, is it now time to enlist in the much-needed second American Revolution? Liberate our own country before starting conflicts that will only result in an existential demise of our nation. The American holocaust planned from within and exercised by commands from traitors is the real reign of terror that faces every truehearted citizen.</p>
<p>An empire necessitates the elimination of the Republic. If Crimea can hold a referendum, only the NWO Jacobins deny the same option for us.</p>

</div>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an industrial combine in Nazi Germany called <strong>IG Farben</strong>. It was the largest chemical/pharmaceutical octopus in the world. It owned companies, and it had favorable business agreements with companies from England to Central America to Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/nixon-rockefeller-ig-farben-and-global-control/" target="_blank">As I mentioned in a recent article</a>, the author of The <em>Devil’s Chemists</em>, Josiah DuBois, traveled to Guatemala in the early days of World War 2, and returned with the comment that, as far as he could tell, Guatemala was “a wholly owned subsidiary of Farben.”</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical empire was and is one of the major forces behind the European Union (EU). It is no accident that these drug corporations wield such power. They aren’t only involved in controlling the medical cartel; they are political planners.</p>
<p>This is how and why Big Pharma fits so closely with what is loosely referred to as the New World Order. The aim of enrolling every human in a cradle-to-grave system of disease diagnosis and toxic drug treatment has a larger purpose: to debilitate, to weaken populations.</p>
<p>This is a political goal. It facilitates control.</p>
<p>IG Farben’s component companies, at the outbreak of World War 2, were <strong>Bayer</strong>, <strong>BASF</strong>, and <strong>Hoechst</strong>. They were chemical and drug companies. Farben put Hitler over the top in Germany, and the war was designed to lead to a united Europe that would be dominated by the Farben nexus.</p>
<p>The loss of the war didn’t derail that plan. It was shifted into an economic blueprint, which became, eventually, the European Union.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s first president was <strong>Walter Hallstein</strong>, the Nazi lawyer who, during the war, had been in charge of post-war legal planning for the new Europe.</p>
<p>As the Rath Foundation reports: In 1939, on the brink of the war, Hallstein had stated, “The creation of the New Law [of the Nazis] is ONLY the task of the law-makers!”</p>
<p>In 1957, with his reputation sanitized, Hallstein spoke the words in this manner: “The European Commission has full and unlimited power for all decisions related to the architecture of this European community.”</p>
<p>Post-war, IG Farben was broken up into separate companies, but those companies were following a common agenda. If, for example, you want to know why the endless debate over labeling GMO food rivals the real issue—banning GMO crops altogether—you can look to these Farben allies: Bayer, BASF, and <strong>Sanofi</strong>, among others.</p>
<p>They are among the leaders in GMO research and production. BASF cooperates with<strong>Monsanto</strong> on research projects. Sanofi is a leader in GM vaccine research.</p>
<p>The original IG Farben had a dream. Its executives and scientists believed they could eventually produce, synthetically, any compound in a laboratory. They could dominate world industry in this fashion.</p>
<p>The dream never died. Today, they see gene-manipulation as the route to that goal.</p>
<p>I refer you to the explosive book, <em>The Nazi Roots of the Brussels EU</em>, by Paul Anthony Taylor, Aleksandra Niedzwiecki, Dr. Matthias Rath, and August Kowalczyk. You can read it at <em>relay-of-life.com</em>. It is a dagger in the heart of the EU.</p>
<p>At the Rath Foundation, you can also read Joseph Borkin’s classic, “The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben.”</p>
<p>In 1992, I was deeply engaged in researching the specific devastating effects of medical drugs. Eventually, I concluded that, at the highest levels of power, these drugs weren’t destructive by accident. They were intended to cause harm. This was covert chemical warfare against the population of the planet. The <strong>Rockefeller-Standard Oil-Farben</strong>connection was a primary piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>It was, of course, Rockefeller (and <strong>Carnegie</strong>) power that forced the birth of pharmaceutical medicine in America, with the publication of the 1910 Flexner Report. The Report was used to excoriate and marginalize Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and other forms of traditional natural practice, in favor of what would become the modern juggernaut of drug-based treatment.</p>
<p>In an article about the FDA, “Medical Murder in the Matrix,” I point out the fact that this federal agency has permitted at least 100,000 deaths of Americans, per year, from the direct effects of drugs it, the FDA, has certified as safe.</p>
<p>The FDA knows these death figures. “Unintended” and “accidental” can no longer be applied to this ongoing holocaust.</p>
<p>The same can be held true for the pharmaceutical industry itself.</p>
<p>People are exceedingly reluctant to come to this obvious conclusion. They prefer to hem and haw and invent excuses or deny the facts.</p>
<p>To understand the dimensions and history of the ongoing chemical warfare against the population, in the form of medical drugs (and of course pesticides), one must factor in the original octopus, IG Farben.</p>
<p>World War 2 never ended. It simply shifted its strategies.</p>
<p>And just as one can trace extensive collaboration between major American corporations and the Nazi war machine, during the military phase of the war, today you see American corporations wreaking destructive havoc on the American people, as Dow, DuPont, Monsanto and others “work their magic for a better life.”</p>
<p>In any fascist system, the bulk of the people working inside the system, including scientists, refuse to believe the evidence of what is happening before their own eyes. They insist they are doing good. They believe they are on the right side. They see greater top-down control as necessary and correct. They adduce reasonable explanations for inflicted harm and death.</p>
<p>This is how and why conspiracies can exist. Only a few people, at the very top, need to know the true motives.</p>
<p>Everyone else tells themselves fairy tales. This deep-seated obsession is an integral part of mind control, and ultimately it is self-inflicted.</p>
<p>The self-created victim calculates: “I would rather stay in my dream than wake up to a nightmare.”</p>
<p>Yes, but acknowledging the nightmare is a step on the road to liberation.</p>
<p>In centuries past, empires conquered foreign lands and made colonies out of them. When that era ended, a less overt style of military and economic conquest was initiated. But there is something most people don’t realize.</p>
<p>When richer nations now go into poorer nations, the so-called incidental goal of bringing “life-saving” medical care with them is a front and a pose.</p>
<p>One of the chief goals of the conquerors is, in fact, pharmaceutical. Changing the habits of populations, so they come to rely on these drugs is high on the to-do list. It rings up profit, of course, for the pharmaceutical empire, and it also poisons the poor into even greater desolation than they are already experiencing. They become even easier to control.</p>
<p>On top of that, the actual untreated causes of the routine desolation—starvation, generation-to-generation malnutrition, contaminated water supplies, lack of general sanitation, overcrowding, and previously stolen agricultural land—are shoved on the back burner of the global media.</p>
<p>Suddenly, we learn that various germ-caused diseases are the real scourges of these countries, and help is coming (slowly), in the form of drugs that kill the germs, along with the medical heroes who will deliver these drugs.</p>
<p>This is a cover story. It’s a preposterous lie. In the conditions of desolation mentioned above, it doesn’t matter what germs are present, and trying to attack them is futile and absurd.</p>
<p>The general desolation weakens and destroys immune systems. At that point, what would normally be completely harmless germs, any germs, can sweep through an area and cause death and severe illness, because the routine processes of the immune system, which would immediately neutralize the germs, are disabled.</p>
<p>The “medical intervention” is meant to defer, for yet another day, the remedying of the actual problems that keep causing disease—and the medical drugs create new and lethal toxicity, leading to more deaths.</p>
<p>This is the standard op of the modern pharmaceutical empire. To know it is proceeding apace, all you have to do is see foreign doctors getting off planes in Third World countries, or read about some drug giant that is undertaking a humanitarian program of supplying medicines and vaccines to “people in desperate need of them.”</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/images.jpeg" /><strong>There is now a New American War.  It is inside America. It is called</strong> <strong>the “War on Terror”. The enemy is YOU!<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It is a staged, Phony War that has been created by the International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS).</p>
<p><strong>This New War on Terror has an enemy. That enemy is the American People, You and Me.</strong></p>
<p>Every Military Force needs an enemy.<strong> </strong>Without an ongoing or perpetual war, the War profiteers quickly go bankrupt.</p>
<p><strong>In order to keep their profit stream going from war, war-profiteers need to create successive new wars or a significant threat of impending war.</strong></p>
<p>Creating pretexts for these much needed wars is very hard work and quite expensive too. But war is a business, a very big business, and war-profiteers need to invest big money to make even more in return.</p>
<p><strong>Members of Congress must be bought, and top Generals and Admirals of the Military High Command too.</strong></p>
<p>This costs a great deal of hard cold cash, but that’s okay because the IZCS gets all it needs from fat US foreign aid to Israel, fat contracts with Israeli Defense providers, and fat donations from those wealthy zionist businessmen that the IZCS manipulates, guilts or shakes down.</p>
<p>At this point, a select group of 70,000 K-Street Lobbyists go to work distributing funds to get elected officials on Board. The several select Generals and Admirals are handled more covertly.</p>
<p>If this is not enough revenue to pay off the necessary officials, the IZCS gets the rest directly from its private Central Banksters who can create all the money they want digitally, anytime they want, and give it to tribal brothers or anyone else, anytime they want.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course the key thing here is a significant portion of these fat revenues are kicked back to the corrupt, bought and owned members of Congress who voted for them, and to select top Generals and Admirals of the High Military Command who support the IZCS intended proxy wars by America on their behalf.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under President Obama’s Administration, for whatever reasons, the High Military Command has not been willing to take payoffs and favors and has not been blackmail-able by the IZCS.</p>
<p>[Note: this is a long article and one option is to read the caps first and then any areas you are interested in if you have time]</p>
<p><strong>Here is the new game in the so-called American Defense Industry. </strong> It is a stateside game and it involves magically transforming any and all innocent, Constitutional, law-abiding citizens into Domestic Dissenters, aka “Domestic Terrorists” or something close enough to declare war on “Potential Domestic Dissenters, aka “Potential Domestic Terrorists”. This is an occult, alchemical symbolic processing of the American people (aka “we the people”) into an defined domestic enemy that can be waged war against on many fronts–phone and email tapping, massive spying and infiltration of all domestic groupings, even neighborhood coffee parties or local church charities–you name it, everything.</p>
<p><strong>This new redefinition of normal law-abiding Americans into “Enemies of the State” and its internal security apparatus</strong> as a threat to national security <strong>IS</strong> a magical conversion or transformation of the normal American Society, mainstream law abiding America, into a huge domestic national security market. This is all an horrendous BIG LIE.</p>
<p>Actually the real situation is just the opposite–it is the USG and specifically the Fusion Centers and the Department of Homeland Security run by perverts and enemies of “we the people” that are the real risk to the true and actual national security of America the republic and to all honest, law abiding, Constitutional Americans. And the USG and DHS and Fusion Center officials are nothing less than world class criminals committing both High Treason and Sedition against America the Republic. The USG has been hijacked and is being run by those who have turned everything upside down.</p>
<p>This redefinition of course involves placing cameras and microphones on almost every street corner in the light-poles and pulsed beam psychotronic generators in many street lamps, turned on full power during rush hour to sedate and subdue the populace in order to keep the masses in line.</p>
<p><strong>Some say that the new Chairman of the JCS, General Martin Dempsey, is a breath of fresh air, a real American Patriot</strong> who honors his Oath to defend the US Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>So far, General Dempsey has resisted major efforts to coerce him to support and engage in any new major American Mideast Air and Ground invasion (another American proxy war for Israel).</p>
<blockquote><p>And many believe that our new Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is another America-firster who takes his oath to defend the US Constitution seriously also.</p></blockquote>
<p>JCS Chairman Dempsey’s independence and commitment to America on this matter has elevated him to the status of a “rock star” in the view of many who appreciate his steadfastness, and he is regarded as a true America-firster.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some experts view JCS Chairman Dempsey’s integrity and commitment to America the Republic as a major turning point, signaling the realization by the High Military Command that the 9/11 attacks were an inside-job, a false-flag attack run by the IZCS with the help of several Traitors within the USAF, JCS, and NORAD.</p>
<p>And that it also signals a shocking realization, for the first time, that most of the Institutions of the USG have been deeply hijacked by the IZCS and their Cutouts have included the Bush Cabal which is now struggling to maintain a thin hold on power.(1)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Obviously, Chairman Dempsey’s and Defense Secretary Hagel’s steadfast resistance to being manipulated by the IZCS</strong> into fighting another major Mideast ground and Air proxy war for Israel appears to be driving the IZCS to desperation.  So far these America-firsters are holding fast against any and all IZCS manipulations and pressure and doing an excellent job staying on course.</p>
<p>The IZCS knows that unless it gets another American proxy war in the Mideast for Israel, they are finished.  They also know that if the American masses ever start finding out that 9/11 was planned and controlled by those owned by the IZCS, they are done too.</p>
<p><strong>Actually the 9/11 attacks of the IZCS were in a sense a going-for-broke gamble</strong> of everything they have against the House (America the Republic). There is a very strong new American Populism which is emerging rapidly as a spontaneous by-product of the world-wide Internet and the Alternative news it carries, which provides truth to the masses for the first time.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Top insiders know all the names of who did the 9/11 inside-job false-flag attacks and are are ready to testify</strong> if an independent prosecutor is assigned and a special Grand Jury is called, and appropriate  immunity agreements are offered for “coming clean”. At least one, Steve Pieczenik, MD, Ph.D., (former Assistant Secretary of State and father of many deep cover black ops, and also the main character in many Tom Clancy books) has already gone public and named names and has said he is willing to testify in a Federal Court as to who did it.(2) Obviously Dr. Pieczenik is another great American Hero.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Some top insiders close to to the High Command have suggested that America is so deeply hijacked by the IZCS</strong> that it will take some years of the actions of high officials like JCS Chairman General Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to turn the tide and neutralize the rampant influence peddling of the IZCS over almost every member of Congress and many officials in the Department of Justice and the Alphabets.</p>
<blockquote><p>Certainly the Department of Homeland Security is now recognized as a major IZCS beach-head inside America and part of a long term plan to establish a foreign controlled IZCS neo-Bolshevik military force inside America to Tyrannize, wage war against, and eventually serially mass murder most Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why some top insiders refer to DHS as the New American Gestapo or Stasi.  Some see it now morphing into a New Red Cheka mass-murder machine for dispensing Bolshevik-style Red Terror and mass-murder to Americans.</p>
<p><strong>The Cold War was a great boon to the defense Industry even though it never went hot anywhere but Korea and Vietnam, which were limited to prevent an all out nuclear exchange.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The first Iraq War (aka the Gulf War) under Bush1 resulted from covert trickery using Kuwaiti cross drilling, which was reported to Saddam Hussein by April Glaspie, who convinced him that the USG wouldn’t care if he invaded Kuwait to stop the theft of his oil from his main oil field. The second Mideast war was an Invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan to get even with the alleged perps who supposedly did the 9/11 attacks, but actually never were involved at all.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>President Obama is now unwilling to deploy American troops in any major new American land war or massive air bombardment campaign in the Mideast.</strong> Nor is the current US Military High Command willing to allow it at this time. In order to appease the so-called Defense Industry and their lobbyists, he has apparently deployed numerous teams of “special operators” and mercenaries but these have been fighting terrorists supported by America, a self-defeating exercise.</p>
<p>He has also continued to deploy drones with air-to-ground missiles to mass murder numerous innocent women, children and non-combatants. All these Mideast and African wars are illegal, unConstitutional, undeclared and unprovoked.  They have been sold to the American People and the Congress based on the BIG LIE that they are preemptive strikes necessary to prevent any more 9/11 attacks.</p>
<blockquote><p>The need for preemptive strikes to prevent terrorist attacks inside America is an obvious lie for numerous reasons. Anyone who examines all the available evidence on 9/11, including the BBC live TV announcement by Jane Standley that WTC7 fell to the ground 20 minutes before it happened (due to top MI-6 control officers forgetting about American Daylight savings time (too much personal coke use perhaps?).(3)</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, if DHS’s main concern is spying on normal Americans who dissent and crushing them because DHS believes they are “domestic terrorists or “potential Domestic terrorists” or “lone wolf” spontaneously emerging domestic terrorists, this obviates any lies about the need for preemptive foreign attacks. The reason?  Because DHS now claims that the emergence of these ordinary lone wolf domestic terrorists inside America is a spontaneous phenomenon, as well as a completely independent problem that has nothing to do with foreign terrorists in the Mideast.</p>
<p>And beside DHS allows open borders, “sanctuary cities” where illegals can not be checked for legal immigration status, given traffic tickets for minor violations, and must be granted drivers licenses and social security cards without any proof of residency. Plus, thousands of Mideast Immigrants are allowed in to America when there is already a shortage of jobs, and the Muslim Brotherhood is invited into the White House to meet with President Obama.(4)</p>
<blockquote><p>It is obvious that as the major American Defense Contractors who are either owned or controlled by the IZCS have realized that American Mideast war efforts are waning and have worked hard to create their phony War on Terror, first in foreign countries and now in America.</p>
<p>They have worked hard to generate massive public fear in reaction to the 9/11 attacks in order to engender public support and vast expenditures of taxpayer dollars for a large national security market and internal security apparatus, like the Fusion Centers and its specialized assassination teams disguised as corporate or political protection squads, the DHS and the TSA with its Vipr Teams.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This phony, staged War on Terror has been very craftily engineered</strong> to be an unending war that will assure perpetual war profits for Defense Contractors and a perpetual supply of artificially created enemies inside America to feed that war. How is this possible you might ask?</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/youareterror2.jpg" width="300" height="145" />This new War on Terror has been socially engineered</strong> to provide a continual stream of degradations and provocations against the average American, provoking many in a never-ending stream to resist, and causing them to be labeled dissenters.</p>
<p>Once they have been labeled dissenters they are put on a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Main Core Terror Watch List, which top insiders know is a targeted assassination list for later eradication of all Freedom-loving Americans who want to restore the American Constitutional Republic.</p>
<blockquote><p>At present the Main Core list has over ten million Americans on it, and it is growing every day with thousands of new additions. Get a ticket for a driving offense or any arrest (even if later proven innocent) and it is highly likely you will be placed on this Main Core Terror Watch and Assassination list.</p>
<p>If you have a prior drug arrest many years ago or any arrest, it is likely you have already been placed on this list. If a USG web troll or fusion Center Officer comes across any patriotic postings or anything they consider subversive like the East German Stasi, that poster will likely be placed on this list.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Over time these provocations are designed to result in a continuing stream of America dissenters</strong> that want to take their Republic back from the zionist hijackers and will meet DHS tyranny and force with the like. Any and all Dissenters are now being defined as “Enemies of the State”.</p>
<blockquote><p>And anyone who wants to restore the American Republic will also be defined as a “Domestic Terrorist”. DHS is a terrorist group, hand assembled by American/Israeli dual citizen Traitors and is designed to tyrannize, capture and eventually be deployed against Americans to serially mass murder them.  This is why they have been called the New American Gestapo of the Neo-Bolshevik Red Cheka Terror Machine.</p>
<p>If you were a Ron Paul supporter or a Libertarian, you are likely on the Main Core list. If NSA routine scans of any and all of your digital emissions and have picked up enough key trigger words, then you have perhaps already been placed on the List. After all, Marcus Wolfe the former head of the East German Stasi, a vicious torturer and murder of innocent Germans, was hired as a USG consultant to set up DHS two years before he died.(5)<strong><br />

<p>Note the recent admission by US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia that it is without question that the Prison Camps now being built by the USG will eventually be used just like they were in WW2 when innocent Japanese Citizens were wrongly captured, completely asset stripped and placed in USG Prison Camps. (6)</p>
<p><strong>President Eisenhower was an insider placed in position by the Rockefellers</strong> early in his Military career and eventually propelled into the Presidency by them. But even Ike started being bothered by strong pangs of Patriotism and became alarmed at the undue influence of the Military Industrial complex over Congress. In his final public speech as President, he delivered a warning to Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Ike never imagined that the Israelis would serve as the chief action agent for the City of London zionists</strong> and would eventually hijack, buy off, bribe, compromise or honey-trap almost every single member of Congress and also use their vast Central Bankster and manipulated donor funds to hijack almost all American defense and Intel contractors and American communication companies, many of which have been moved to Israel or have been located there in the first place.</p>
<p>Originally his speech included the phrase Military, Industrial, Congressional Complex.  He took out “Congressional” after his political aides informed him that this could end up harming the Republican Party. When he referred to “Military” in the phrase “Military Industrial Complex”, he was actually thinking of the whole new peacetime defense Industry, which was driving the Military Industrial Complex and formation of a permanent armament industry.</p>
<p><strong>Ike became concerned that this permanent armament industry could assert undue influence</strong> on the American political process and could hijack American society and harm its spiritual character.</p>

<p><strong>Disarming the public is a key goal of the IZCS</strong> for everyone in America but them and their stooges at the DHS and the Alphabets or their militarized police now trained by the ADL.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hitler-300x216.jpg" width="300" height="216" />Many Police Chiefs are taken to Israel on all-paid Anti-Terror training Junkets where they drink the Kool-aid and are subjected to some of the most sophisticated Psi powered and Psychotronic mind-kontrol ever deployed. In years past, many were given lavish gifts and provided personal escorts of their age and choice. Perhaps this practice continues?</p>
<p>Any Tyrannical Government must always get rid of we the people’s guns in order to be able to stay in power and concentrate it. A major goal of any tyranny, like what we have in IZCS-hijacked America now, is to gain maximum power by eliminating (as in serial mass-murdering) all political opponents and dissenters. Doubt this? Then check world history the last couple of hundred years.</p>
<p>The USG and DHS is now ramping up the militarization of the Police of American Cities and Suburbs under DOD Program 1033 under the ‘Transfer of Excess Military Property to Local Police Program”.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a video from ‘TheLipTV’, “Over the last decade, we have seen over 5,000 people killed by police in the United States,” when “4,489 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the Iraq war. Since 9-11, you are 29-times more likely to be killed by a police officer than you are by a terrorist.”(7)</p></blockquote>
<p>Most local urban and suburban police departments have been “militarized”, that is, received heavy armament including armored cars, MP5 and M-16 fully-automatic machine guns, grenades, grenade launchers and ballistic shields.</p>
<p><strong>We the people are the new enemy of the militarized police. </strong>The police were set up to “protect and serve”, but their new mission is to wage war against “we the people” on behalf of the IZCS and the ADL.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Every military force must have a designated enemy. The common American is the new enemy of the now militarized police in their new war against Americans on behalf of the IZCS and the ADL.</p>
<p>Whether they realize it or not, the ADL has trained most police to view most Americans (we the people) as the enemy of the police and the Nation State. Ever attended a police training seminar put on by the ADL? Often they hide who really is running it. It’s the biggest bunch of twisted, sick paranoid crap one can ever imagine, and all designed to make police trigger-happy murderers of any citizen who questions their authority in any way or questions any detainment or arrest. Yes, ADL training is a crafty set of lies that produces trigger-happy cops who believe there is a domestic terrorist hiding behind every bush who want to murder them so the police cannot go home to their family at night.</p>
<p>This paranoid belief system will eventually produce this result as a self-fulfilling prophecy, as police tyranny and trigger-happy police continue to murder the innocent and use grossly excessive force for minor offenses. Almost all police abuse of the citizen is delivered “for your own safety”, when that is another big lie.  It is done for the arrogance and authority complex of the police officer–an artifact of over 25 years of ADL training for your local police, who have almost all sold out to the feds in order to get military weapons and gear.  All in return for signing over jurisdiction to DHS and the Feds.</p>
<p>Police are instructed to “charge up” anyone who questions them in any way, and any slight hesitation must be met with false charges of assault and/or battery towards the officer. Officers are told, an arrestee can beat the rap, but they cannot get out of the “ride” (i.e. the arrest and hassle of it.) They are taught that this deters deviance and crime, when actually it provokes the American people to hate police officers.</p>
<p><strong>The new militarized police have one new main function.</strong>  It is to continually provoke law-abiding, honest citizens with acts of selfishness and tyranny in order to “role force” them to act out so that “punishment” can be delivered.  The goal, especially with inner urban kids is to make sure they are sold all the drugs they want, in order to dirty them up and get them into the system for life. Big prisons are a private business–a very big business–and quotas or guaranteed imprisonment rates are in place to reduce costs.</p>
<p>Since the IZCS is actually functioning as a neo-Bolshevik political block with East German Stasi and Nazi undertones, this reveals the actual goal of DHS–to serially mass-murder all American dissenters and political opponents. Doubt this?  Then consider the purchase of over 2 Billion 40 Caliber hollow-point rounds and 7,000 M-16 fully-automatic (real assault rifles, not the mere look-a-like AR-15) and thousands of armored vehicles and armored booths, raised spy-towers and grenade launchers.(8) Many of these armored vehicles have been given to local police who have Police Chiefs who are Traitors to America the Republic in exchange for complete submission to Federal Jurisdiction of DHS.</p>
<p><strong>Some of these traitors are just stupid and overly impressed by Feds or DHS Spooks</strong>, others have been paid off in very large cash donations (hundreds of thousands of USD in military duffel bags, untraceable CIA drug profits. Some have been sexually compromised by Pedophile or Honey Traps and then blackmailed into submission. Some have succumbed after being threatened or having their families threatened. This is the lowest scum-bag manipulation (aka Humint) ever deployed, and it is everyday stock and trade for the IZCS, the world’s biggest sexual compromisers, and pedophile and sex-slave operators.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons of History: </strong>Any serious study of History quickly shows that war is a vehicle for a nation’s leaders to maintain control over their nation-states. The infamous Iron Mountain Report gave an inside glimpse of how the super-elite criminal Psychopaths running America thought about the need for ongoing war or a suitable state crisis to unify the society and solidify their control over society.</p>
<p><strong>Wars are craftily engineered </strong>by criminal super-elites who rule nation-states and their advisers. There are various, crafty ways for a nation’s leaders to covertly start wars. The well-established standby is to stage False-Flag attacks and then wage war on the nation state or entity that you have framed for the attack that you did.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another way to create a terrorist with a long and successful track record is to capture abandoned children in Mideast Countries, provide for their daily needs, while mind-kontrolling them to become terrorists with psychotic suicidal delusions of revenge toward what has been identified to them as their religious enemy which needs destruction to please their god.</p>
<p>The British, the Israelis, and the Saudi are experts at this, and American Taxpayers have unknowingly provided a large portion of the funding for this. One trick well known among intel insiders is the practice of acts of terror against the nation of the mind-kontrolled children to create an enemy for them to later attack in revenge.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Lots of American Taxpayer dollars were covertly dispensed to create and finance terrorists for future Mideast wars.</strong> American Intel has spent a great deal of money paying others,  such as the Israelis, to do this. Otherwise, American Intel has not been very successful themselves.  Their only real success is their arming, funding and training of the Mexican Drug Cartels and the training and deployment of the disgusting mass-murdering death squads in Central and South America, who murdered over one hundred thousand innocent women, children and young men.(9)</p>
<p><strong>The 9/11 attacks were an inside job by the USAF and the IZCS.</strong> The staged Gladio-style False-Flag attack was the choice selected for the attack on the Twin Towers in NYC and the Pentagon in Washington, DC, on 9-11-2001. This attack was done by the USAF, under the authority of a zionist-controlled Criminal Cabal inside the JCS and the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).(10)</p>
<blockquote><p>The 9/11 attack was planned, set up and run by NeoCon top Policy-Makers, Israeli Intel and their stateside Sayanims, utilizing a small criminal cabal inside the USAF, NORAD and the JCS. These are facts that can no longer be disputed by any reasonable person who has examined all the available evidence.</p>
<p>And it is exceedingly clear to any reasonable person who examines the pre-announcement of WTC-7 destruction that the whole attack was pre-scripted in London and Israel, and that WTC-7 was wired in advance with conventional demolition charges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Typically, it takes a considerable amount of time and labor to wire up a building, which suggests complete access at the security level.  This means that since it was a federalized building, with CIA and NYC Emergency Center occupants, building security had to be involved one way or another. And now that it has been proved that WTC-7 was wired up beforehand and demo’ed on 9-11, this means the Twin Towers had to have been pre-wired, too.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>The War on Terror is obviously a Phony.</strong> But it has been the greatest boon to the American Defense Complex ever, with many times more net American Taxpayer dollars spent on this war than any other war in history, including WW2 or the Vietnam War.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to establish a war is to create and fund so-called foreign terrorist groups.</strong> This is a costly exercise that take years and can involve as much work as fighting a war.  Yes, creating terrorist groups is very hard and expensive work.</p>
<blockquote><p>But enemies for necessary wars can be created if you have the technological help of a nation that has hundreds of years experience in creating its own enemies. This nation is the City of London (Financial District), a separate nation state like the Vatican, located within England.</p>
<p>There is a reason England has been referred to as “Perfidious Albion” for centuries. They have been known for their ability to instigate chaos inside nations they want to control by their standard well-developed strategy of “Divide and Conquer”. They are experts at creating long term provocations between different nations that have competing economic interests.</p>
<p>They do this in order to establish a beach-head from which to control the removal of natural resources and accrued wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember the Opium Wars</strong> (Boxer Rebellions) where England brought opiate addiction to China as a covert act of war in order to recover all the silver and gold paid to import Tea, spices and silk from China? This was low intensity (covert) warfare that twice led to a short hot war.</p>
<p><strong>The creation of the nation state Israel was created to serve as a long term provocation for numerous Mideast perpetual wars.</strong> This is why the Balfour Declaration was made, why the Nazi sent the “low Jews” to the labor camps, while the “High Jews” were able to either emigrate elsewhere or become collaborators like George Soros.</p>
<p>This is why the City of London created the New Israel and took land away from the Palestinians to set up a nation of Khazarian Judaic converts (aka “fake Hebrews”), a racially paranoid group mind-kontrolled to believe the delusion that they were of ancient Abrahamic Hebrew Blood.</p>
<blockquote><p>The IZCS believes in preemptive strikes against Goyim and their institutions. Judaics have also been mind-kontrolled by Zionists (many of whom are not Judaics at all) to believe that they must hijack the American political system to preemptively crush Christianity and American Goyim Culture.</p>
<p>And that if they didn’t succeed in this, they would be persecuted again, just like what they call the “holocaust”–translated from Old English as “a fiery sacrifice”.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/38783-israel-killing-machine2.jpg" width="276" height="248" /><strong>This philosophy of striking first</strong> and eliminating the Goyim to prevent another “holocaust” from ever occurring” is a Bolshevik ideology based on the “End Justifies the Means”.</p>
<p>This paranoid strike-first obsession will produce push back and persecution eventually, thus serving as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Of course the Zionists who control Talmudic, Noahide Judaism know that the 6-million-dead figure is untrue, because this had appeared in the late 1800′s andearly 1900′s in Judaic literature long before the work camps of WW2.</p>
<p><strong>New Genetics research exposes a vast, paranoid race-based delusion.</strong> Recent Johns Hopkins genetic research has shown conclusively that approximately 80% of the Palestinians are of Hebrew (Abrahamic) bloodlines, and approximately 90% of Judaic converts living in greater Israel are not of ancient Hebrew (Abrahamic) bloodlines. Thus, the world’s greatest anti-Semites appear to be Israelis who have stolen Palestinian land and continue to do so against all UN rulings and International Law.</p>
<p><strong>The nation of Israel was set up as the private nation state and Tribal Intel front for the City of London Zionist private Central Banksters</strong>, to serve as a beach-head to control the production and distribution of Mideast oil. This delusion that the Khazarian Judaic converts were God’s Chosen People (ancient Hebrews from the Ten Tribes) was then en-cultured into these Judaics who were sent to Palestine and armed so they could use terrorism to expand their region of control.</p>
<p>Greater Israel has no real boundaries and is ever expedient, as Israeli militants keep taking land and murdering unarmed Palestinians.</p>
<blockquote><p>A serious spell, a racial delusion of superiority has been cast on many Judaics no matter where they live, but especially so among those living in greater Israel, where the Luciferian Hex Flag flies. Whether true or not, the flag signifies the merger of demonic fallen angel Beast-Bloodlines from above, bred with Human female bloodlines below.</p>
<p>If we accept this Hex Flag at face value, does this mean that the top Zionists running the IZCS are perhaps alien/human hybrids, or at least claim to be in their own secret ceremonies that Stew Webb has exposed numerous times in articles and radio appearances over many years?<strong><br />
</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It is obvious that the IZCS has hijacked the US Department of State and the US Military Defense Complex as well as Congress. Listen to what Kay Griggs had to say about this.  She was married to a top USM officer and mind-kontrolled “wetboy” who became out of control and beat her and then tried to have her shut up. He and/or his controllers serious stalked and harassed Kay Griggs for years.</p>
<p>She went to live with Sarah McClendon for protection and was interviewed by Pastor Rick Strawcutter, which probably raised her profile so much that it saved her life.  Kay is another Great American Hero and is a courageous standup person, one of the best you could ever meet anytime, anyplace. If you get a chance, be sure and listen to her 8-hour video affidavit with Pastor Rick Strawcutter, who is another Great American Hero. You will be amazed and angered at who has been running the USG and the Military.(11)</p>
<p>Kay’s video affidavit is packed with insider secrets known only by top Intel insiders. How much do you want to know about what is really going on in the background? How much do you dare to pull the curtain back to expose the Wizard Of Oz (as in Ounce)? You will need a great deal of courage to handle what Kay Griggs reveals. By the way, a great deal of her testimony has been cross-corroborated by experts.  Any errors she makes are minor and not directly related to her main claims.</p>

<p><strong>Two sides of the same coin:</strong> Of course those on the inside of the Ruling Cabal know that Nazi-ism and Zionism are two sides of the same coin and run by the City of London Central bank controllers. This entity is the Old Black Nobility (OBN), which prefers to stay in the background.</p>
<p><strong>The IZCS controls Private Central Fiat, Fractional Reserve Banking:</strong> This reality that the IZCS owns and controls private Central Banking means that they have access to and can utilize Babylonian Money-Magick to make the money they need to control the USG officials and Congress from nothing.  This access provides vast sums of money in seemingly endless quantities.  Thus, they have access to all the cash they need to buy, own, compromise or blackmail almost every single Congressman/woman and Senator in America.</p>
<p>The serious down-side of this system of Babylonian Money-Magick is that it is based on fiat or fake-money with nothing but debt behind it. Actually this debt is imaginary, but has a stranglehold on most of the members of the societies it has hijacked. But it cannot go on without catastrophic readjustments, which will occur at some point.</p>
<blockquote><p>A worldwide Web of Debt: The private Central Banksters in America have been so adept and successful at extracting wealth in America and all over the world, replacing it with debt, that nearly the whole world is now engulfed in extreme debt.</p>
<p>And this debt has now reached the point it cannot be paid off. This of course is the IZCS’s age-old plan which will result in massive chaos that engulfs the world and destroys all social systems, family systems, sex roles, and systems of government.</p>
<p>After this destruction of conventional society occurs, it is expected by the IZCS top leadership that a pure Luciferian NWO System will arise from the globalist framework they have put in place.  They expect this NWO System emerging from the ashes to be their Phoenix, like the legendary Phoenix of Greek and Roman mythology.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>All this tidal wave of debt is phony and a big charade. </strong> If all the people of the world unite, nationalize their monetary systems and declare all debt null and void, and if they assign all such debt directly to Central Banksters responsible for creating it, prosperity to “we the people” can return like it did to the Colonists who left England.</p>
<p><strong>Babylonian Money-Magick has been used to create a debt based economy.</strong>  It does this by producing “onerous usury” and allows the easy transformation of “all the money created from nothing which is worth nothing at face value” into the vast amounts of ever-increasing wealth.  This wealth–fiat money–is covertly stripped from the common man these Banksters provide the money for and use as a means to extract real value and wealth from.</p>
<p>The Zionist IZCS vehicle used to gain control over almost every single member of Congress and to buy, compromise and control almost every top USG official and Judge, is the 70,000+ K Street Lobbyists, AIPAC and others who distribute the money to their marks, often through campaign contributions, cash to offshore accounts, and various other expensive luxury perks, such as ridiculously high honorariums for meaningless propaganda speeches.</p>
<p><strong>And AIPAC, the ADL, the SPLC and the like are also zionist tools of espionage against America the Republic.</strong></p>
<p>They should all be investigated by the FBI and fully prosecuted and convicted and sentenced for espionage by the Department of Justice. Note, espionage in many cases is a Capital Crime.</p>
<p>If the Rosenbergs were prosecuted, convicted and executed for their espionage against America, why should these IZCS Cutouts go free without identification and full prosecution?</p>
<p>These entities are really Intel fronts for espionage against America the Republic on behalf of the IZCS which includes the City of London zionist Central banksters, Israel, American NeoCons, and Israeli-American dual citizens who have betrayed America, putting Israel first over America.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/maddogisrael-220x320.jpg" width="220" height="320" />Vast Funding for zionist Cutouts.</strong> These entities receive vast funding from the zionist Central Banksters and from the wealthy Judaic businessmen they shake-down or manipulate for large donations by playing on their paranoid tribal delusions.</p>
<p>These tribal delusions are that donations are necessary to prevent excessive antisemitism and future persecutions or “holocausts” by Goyims and Christians.</p>
<p>Many Judaics in America and elsewhere have been en-cultured with the false ideation that Nazi-ism was a Christian phenomena and Christians and Goyim must be destroyed.</p>
<p>This of course this is as far from the truth as possible because Hitler was a British Agent and Nazi-ism was created by the Tavistock Institute and the City of London Central Banksters and a counter-force to the Bolshevism they created and deployed in Russia in 1917.</p>
<blockquote><p>What does the International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS) run out of the City of London through its main Cutouts Israel and the hijacked USG attain? Obviously the IZCS’s unlimited funds and the fact it owns and/or controls almost every member of Congress and most USG officials and Judges, means that the ICS has been able to determine USG Policy.</p>
<p>It can do this because it owns and/or controls all USG top Policy-Makers, most of whom just happen to be outside of the visible USG and within the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously the crimes of the IZCS and their espionage fronts like AIPAC, the ADL, SPLC and the like against the American Republic are far worse than the Rosenbergs.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Listed below are some of the IZCS crimes against America:</strong></p>
<p>1. The NSA and all American Intel has been completely hijacked by the IZCS and all NSA intel data goes directly to Israeli Defense Contractors and Israeli communication Corporations that process all American phone calls and data transmissions. This means that the Five Eyes International Intel System is really a Six Eyes System controlled by Israeli Intel entities and proprietaries.</p>
<p>Thus, America has no real Intel, and Israeli Intel has control over all American politicians, judges and officials by use of this Intel for human compromise, blackmail and sophisticated mind-kontrol operations. Any time factions within American Intel agencies (there are 37 and growing) form opposition to the IZCS, this is readily discovered through Israeli Intel intercepts of NSA raw Intel and actions to neutralize such efforts are quickly deployed–whatever is required.</p>
<p>The conclusion here is that America no longer has any real Intel of its own–none at all–it is all compromised and hijacked by Israeli and City of London Cutouts and contractors.</p>
<p>2. Because the IZCS has hijacked all American Intel directly from NSA feeds, the IZCS has a long history of stealing American intellectual property and providing it to their corporations. The IZCS can also hijack American corporate bids and defeat them repeatedly until many companies go out of business.</p>
<p>3. The IZCS has compromised almost every single member of Congress, US Supreme Court Judges, most Federal, and almost every single USG official and American Intel Director.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TSA-Groping-Glove.jpg" width="260" height="280" />4. The IZCS’s new DHS is a zionist terrorist front, a new Internal American Army that has been deployed against YOU as their NEW ENEMY. The IZCS has created and deployed DHS as the New American Stasi and a New American Neo-Bolshevik Red Cheka. It is controlled by an Israeli-American dual citizen who made millions of USD from selling unshielded X-ray machines to the TSA, which is creating numerous cancer clusters among TSA officers.</p>
<p>5. The principal goal of the IZCS in America is to deploy DHS to tyrannize and degrade Americans and then eventually to start a live “shoot to kill” war against ordinary Americans who organize to take their government back and restore the American Constitutional Republic. This tyranny by DHS is planned to culminate in serial mass-murder of up to 80% of Americans–one way or another.</p>
<p>6. The IZCS has set up and deployed AIPAC, the ADL, the SPLC and others to serve as agents of espionage inside America, to work to destroy its institution of government, dirty up Americans and to destroy the American Family, America’s language borders and culture and to destroy Christianity and Deism in general.</p>
<p>7. The IZCS has hijacked top factions in the CIA, DEA and other American Intel and uses them to traffick illegal narcotics and drugs into America to raise money for deep-cover covert ops.</p>
<p>8. The IZCS has compromised almost every major Urban and Suburban police Department, coercing them to sign secret transfer of jurisdiction agreements giving the Feds, DHS and the Fusion Centers complete jurisdiction in any matter they choose.  In return, they are bribed with “stolen” war materials, machine guns, rounds, armored cars and, even in some cases, grenade launchers.</p>
<p>9. The IZCS has stolen numerous loads of nuclear materials from US DOD contractors and refiners for their Dimona Plant and nuclear storage center.</p>
<p>10. The IZCS has used NSA-provided intel to murder hundreds of witnesses to their crimes and federal Whistleblowers. The rest that they don’t murder are watched and often become victims of targeted harassments, placed on DHS and Fusion Center “Terror Watch Lists”, “No-Fly” Lists and “No work lists”. Take the example of Ronald Reagan’s Secret Agent, the Great American Hero Lee Wanta who was instrumental in “bringing down” the Soviet Union. Lee Wanta has been wrongfully imprisoned, tortured, and endures ongoing harassment.</p>
<p>Or consider Mark Novitsky, another Great American Hero who refused to do wrong and coverup crimes while working for an NSA contractor. Both of these American Heroes have paid a terrible price for obeying the law and for putting the welfare of the American People first.</p>
<p>11. The IZCS has hijacked the America Monetary Production and Distribution System and transformed Americans into debt-slaves, drastically reduced the Middle Class and the standard of living, and done this by massive asset-stripping of American wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>12. The IZCS has used its Cutouts to debase American culture, take the God of our Founding Fathers out of the schools and institutions where they had certain Bible verses and phrases etched in stone, destroy traditional male and female sex roles, destroy the family, promote sexual perversion, promote promiscuity and sexual irresponsibility and addiction, promote diversity and political correctness and illegal immigration and multi-culturalism.</p>
<p>13. The IZCS has completely compromised all of the Major Mass media, transforming it into a propaganda dispenser for the USG and the Central Banksters which are completely under their control. Thus the Major media is now the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM).</p>
<p>14. The IZCS has hijacked American seed companies and most major food processors and is in the process of deploying sophisticated GMO’s which will, over time, radically increase the death rate of Americans.</p>
<p>15. The IZCS has hijacked Big Pharma and Big medicine and has used it to deploy vaccines containing monkey viruses like SV40 and numerous harmful adjuvants like squalene and aluminum or formaldehyde, as well as so-called preservatives like ethyl mercury.</p>
<p>16. The IZCS has hijacked many large Insurance Companies and used them for its own designated purposes.</p>
<p>17. The IZCS has deployed contract aircraft through their hijacked intel groups like the CIA that are spraying toxic weather and eugenic substances in the atmosphere. They have also been able to covertly add these toxic substances to ordinary jet fuel.</p>
<p>Numerous samples of these substances have been collected by researchers and scientists who have had them analyzed.  What they found were toxic levels of nano-particulized aluminum, barium slats, Hemophilus Influenza, red blood cells, white blood cells, toxic molds, and other strange fiber like substances and compounds.</p>
<p>18. The IZCS has used its vast criminal networks and resources to launder its drug money by buying up large real estate entities and banks and is able to finance almost every new major corporate building with laundered drug money.</p>
<p>19. The IZCS has used a great deal of its money from illegal drug trafficking to build deep underground military bases (DUMBS). Some of these bases are claimed by top insiders to be joint ventures with alien entities and have special genetic labs involved in the development of alien ET/human hybrids.</p>
<p>20. The IZCS is the world’s top Mind-kontroller.  It has used hijacked American Intel and its defense contractors to develop and deploy advanced high technology for psychotronic, direct brain entrainment and sound-based subliminal mind-kontrol.</p>
<p>21. Israel used advanced mind-kontrol on those who accept its all-paid junkets. Visitors end up drinking their special Kool-aide and are hit with sophisticated psychotronics, becoming significantly mind-kontrolled to operate as functional zionists without even being aware of it.</p>
<p>22. The IZCS has created what they call the federal family. They have done this by creating Fusion Centers, the DHS, the TSA and numerous armed (previously unarmed) agencies like the Department of Education. Unduly large salaries and extremely liberal benefits have been provided, as well as a special anointing with authoritarian powers to kill with very little accountability if any, due to the War on Terror.</p>
<p>Many of these federal Family folks have been mind-kontrolled by shoulder-held constant on pulsed beam microwave radios and other highly advanced psychotronics, which increases their tendencies to tyrannize and become violent with the public and minimizes their ability to control violent impulses which may crop up.</p>
<p>23. The IZCS has militarized local police departments and many Sheriff’s departments. Their ADL provides most of the police training and drives a hard line against any public dissent, describing it as “domestic terrorism”. It controls what the Fusion Centers and DHS put out as war propaganda which labels the public as “Domestic Terrorists”.</p>
<p>Here is the first part of one of their confidential lists of Domestic Terrorists or Suspected Domestic Terrorists:  Catholics, Evangelical Christians, Veterans, Libertarians, Constitutionalists, Tax protestors, Gun owners…..These reports of course are pure ADL propaganda lies and complete smear jobs, all intended to provoke police and Federal Family officers to tyrannize and easily become violent with innocent ordinary Americans or anyone who decides to peacefully protest, an American Constitutional Right.</p>
<p>Remember that the operational goal of the top Policy-Makers who are tools of the IZCS is to provoke a full scale shooting war between ordinary Americans and their police and Federal family Members such as DHS.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  The IZCS has hijacked America and has deployed numerous weapons against it now culminating in a phony, staged War on Terror, and if you are an American or live in America, one way or another YOU will soon become THEIR NEW ENEMY. Yes, from here on out if you live in America, you are the designated enemy in this new War On Terror.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the federal family, it is suggested that you read and study up on the Night of the Longknives (Operation Hummingbird) and the various purges under Lenin, Stalin and Mao. Maybe you should reconsider the oath you took to UPHOLD the US Constitution from ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN and DOMESTIC.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now for some good news about all this.  Despite how bleak this all seems it is far from hopeless and American are beginning to wake up in mass. This is due to the worldwide Internet and the massive dissemination and diffusion of the alternative news.  Once facts are published they sink into the hearts of “we the people” with a certain resonance that makes them take hold.</p>
<p>It’s almost instinctive how truth sticks like glue in people hearts and minds and spreads like wildfire all around the Earth. At least 1% of the American population has woken up. Some estimates are 11%. Proof of this is the massive first time gun buyers, the massive sales of high powered handguns, rifles and 12 gauge shotguns and massive ammo sales.</p>
<p>Guns and ammo have literally been flying off the shelves the last several years and there have been serious ammo shortages due to the massive DHS and USG stockpiling of 40 Caliber Hollow Pints and M-16 ammo rounds.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/070213dhs.jpg" width="245" height="210" />Once 12% of the population wakes up a critical mass turning point will spontaneously occur and through various very strange mass societal changes will occurs and new very powerful, unstoppable populism will emerge and the IZCS will be driven out.</p>
<p>If they are stupid enough to take us into a live shooting war, Internal Civil War with mass killing, the public will suffer great losses but the Federal Family will split and it and the IZCS and any of their forces will be defeated.</p>
<p>All wars are always won by what is in the hearts and minds.  In America the American Spirit lives and is getting stronger every day. Soon the foreign filth and their Cutouts run by the Kingpins from City of London and Israel, the perps that have hijacked America, the IZCS, will be completely exposed, stopped, or routed out, one way or another.</p>
<p>And there is good evidence that many retired Intel Cowboys have gone back to work to bring the IZCS Beast down and destroy its grip on American Intel and private Central Banking. Some of the covert operators have long records of success and can create and use numerous different identities.</p>
<p>Many of these Intel Cowboys can use make up and make their own credentials to impersonate officers, draw military and USG paychecks from multiple sources, all at the same time and hack into any computer system anywhere in the USG or American Intel, anywhere anytime. Most of them just did not realize that the IZCS has taken control because of unlimited money provided by zionist Central Banksters and Judaic supporters.</p>
<p>And the best news of all is that more than a few seasoned Intel Cowboys that served the Bush Cabal at its center as well as the IZCS, have now woken up, pulled away from the Bush cabal and are targeting the IZCS with deep cover covert ops that would make your hair stand on end if you were allowed to know.</p>
<p>Some of these Intel Cowboys have now admitted that they were kept so narrowly compartmented that they did not realize the whole picture until the Internet and the numerous Federal Whistle-blowers coming forward and spilling the beans. the simple fact is this, the worldwide Internet and the alternative news it provides spreads truth like a wildfire that cannot be put out even with the application of military force.</p>
<p>The Internet is the New Gutenberg Press, the Achilles Heel of the IZCS.  The Internet will turn out to be the greatest trick in history played on the IZCS by the young men at Drapa.  They sold the Internet to the IZCS and its SSG promising the greatest spying and surveillance system imaginable.  Yes the IZCS got much of what was promised but also a very big hidden surprise which assures their complete exposure and destruction, piece by piece. And this disassembling of the IZCS is already well under way.</p>
<p>The IZCS is now in its death throes and is like a rabid, cornered dog.  That makes it very dangerous for the next year or two until it is completely defanged which is coming. If they use the Samson option which they have been threatening numerous nation-states with (they already used it on japan with the nukes planted in the sea bed and in the security camera on site because Japanese turned against them).</p>
<p>New factions within the Military High Command and the USN have already taken note and are working carefully in the background to defang Dimona by utilizing secret satellite activated back-doors in various hardware circuits.</p>
<p>During the height of the bush Cabal (Bush1) those Intel Cowboys that did know were arrested and jailed on trumped up charges to discredit any possible testimony before Congress or in the courts. Now that many have been informed of what really happened on 9-11-01, they are hopping mad that America has been hijacked and the Constitution and its Bill of Rights, and the Rule of Law has been suppressed and ignored by this world’s largest criminal cabal.</p>
<p>The IZCS attacks on America on 9-11-01 have proved to have been a “going for broke” attempt to build a expanded Israeli in greatest intended form. We now know that it was the greatest and final reckless mistake of Israel so far. Even far worse than Israel’s False-Flag attack on the USS Liberty in their attempt to draw America into a Mideast War at the time which even President Johnson, their crypto Judaic stooge refused.</p>
<p>And now many Americans have finally been informed that the Murrah Building attack as well as the first NYC Twin Towers attack using a 55 drum of cyanide stolen from Louis Champon’s Natural Cherrie Flavoring Plant in Boca Raton, Florida, financed by Dr. Ishan Barbouti, the IZCS Cutout that has died at least three times and always come back to life.</p>
<p>As few know, only the top NeoCons 911 Planners, Dr. Barbouti rose again and came back to life to assist with many of the 9/11 attacks subplots which were designed to provide numerous false leads. A few of the most Patriotic Intel Cowboys who have “traveled” very close to the very “top of the pyramid” now believe that Israel provided the anti-matter positron micro-nukes which were installed in the Twin Towers elevators approximately every ten floors.</p>
<p>Most retired Intel Cowboys had previously thought Israel was a supportive Intel partner but didn’t realize that Israel murdered 135 Americans on the Liberty ship as a False-Flag attack and also murdered another 3,000 humans being in NYC and at the Pentagon on 911, assisted by Traitors within the USAF, NORAD and the JCS.</p>
<p>Now that these Intel Cowboys know the truth, they have woken up and back at work serving America’s true “National Security”. I don’t know exactly what they will do but I would expect some very, very crafty covert moves to expose, drive the IZCS out of America or demo it irreparably if necessary.</p>

<p>If you really want to understand the world we are living in, you better stick with the Zionist media. The Jerusalem Post will provide you with the names of the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-Features/Forbes-ranking-The-worlds-richest-Jews-310104">Jews who own the planet</a>. The British Jewish Chronicle will teach you about arch pedophile <a href="http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/57682/jimmy-savile-came-my-batmitzvah">Jimmy Seville’s ties with Israel</a>.  <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/haunted-by-ghosts-1.319263">Haaretz</a> will even let me speak about all those topics <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/09/28/the-dangerous-cult-of-the-guardian/">The Guardian (Of Zion</a>) is there to shamelessly suppress.</p>
<p>Yesterday I came across a text by <a href="http://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/the-unwelcome-arrival-of-the-quenelle">Dave Rich</a>, a Hasbara mouthpiece operating within the UK ultra-Zionist Community Security Trust. Rich suggested that making a common cause “between Holocaust deniers, neo-fascists, the pro-Palestinian left, and the revolutionary Islamists of Iran is precisely what Dieudonné has spent the past decade trying to achieve.”</p>
<p>Let us admit it, no one could have been more succinct and precise in analysing Dieudonné’s vast impact. Yet in order to fully understand Rich’s statement we’ll have to decode the kosher sound bites and rewrite the above sentence using terminology that may resemble a familiar language.</p>
<p><strong>Holocaust deniers</strong> – In the real world there are no ‘Holocaust deniers’: what we have instead are history revisionists – people who understand that the making of history, is a continuous attempt to narrate the past as we move along. The so-called revisionists re-visit, re-write and revise the past. Those whom Zionists and progressives often tag as ‘Holocaust deniers’ are often enough the last <strong>True Historians</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neo-Fascists and Fascists</strong> – Zionists and Progressives tend to attach the ‘Fascist’ label to those who refuse to surrender to the tyranny of political correctness. Those few people who insist to say what they think against all odds. Thus, those whom the Zionists call ‘Fascists’ are in practice merely a bunch of <strong>Authentic People.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pro-Palestinian Left</strong> – points in the direction of the last pockets of resistance to Kosher indoctrination within the Left, namely, those few resilient subjects and organisations that say NO to George Soros’ funding. Rich is basically referring here to the <strong>Genuine Left, </strong>people and organisations that are committed to Labour, working class politics and solidarity, as opposed to Identity politics spin.</p>
<p><strong>Revolutionary Islamists of Iran</strong> – is the tag Zionists and progressives often attach to <strong>Proper Resistance</strong> &#8211; those Muslims who won’t work for Israel, not even in the spring.</p>
<p>Now that we are familiar with the basic Zionist glossary we are ready to translate Rich’s statement into proper English.</p>
<p>By suggesting that Dieudonné is articulating a common cause  for “Holocaust deniers, neo-fascists, the pro-Palestinian left, and the revolutionary Islamists of Iran” Rich actually admits that Dieudonné has managed to unite the <strong>True Historians, Authentic People, Genuine Left and the Proper Resistance.</strong></p>
<p>In case someone fails to realize it, what Rich is describing here is the true dissidence, an uncompromised league of people that forms the <strong>un-controlled opposition</strong>: those people and institutions that do not subscribe to Zionist hegemony funded by Soros and his ilk.</p>
<p>It is not a secret that the Zionists and Left are in a state of panic, and for a good reason. The ‘anti-quenelle’ campaign that was supposed to ruin Dieudonné’s career backfired colossally. Pretty much when it seemed as if the French people had been Zionised by means of ‘correctness’ and were stripped of their revolutionary inclinations, a tsunami of resentment towards kosher socialism and Jewish political power swept the ground. They panicked and struck back hard. But you cannot fight a tsunami with a boomerang.</p>
<p>Dieudonné’s ‘quenelle’ is already a monumental development in the history of the Jews and their stooges within the Left and the media.</p>

</div>
<p>Yesterday marked the 41st anniversary of the infamous US Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision, which, in effect, legalized abortion-on-demand nationwide. The aftermath of this tragic ruling is the deaths of over 55 million innocent unborn babies. It is no hyperbole to say abortion-on-demand is America’s national holocaust. Think about it, every American citizen today, 41 years old or younger, has never known a country that respected and protected innocent human life in the womb.</p>
<p>Consider this, too: when Hitler’s Third Reich was at its zenith, the abortion rate in Germany was 40%. Guess what? The abortion rate in America today is right at 40%. In fact, statistically speaking, the most dangerous place to be in America is not in an automobile without wearing a seat belt, or on a commercial airliner with a potential terrorist on board, but in the womb of one’s mother.</p>
<p>Dr. Bernard Nathanson once headed America’s largest abortion clinic in New York City. He admitted superintending over the killing of 75,000 unborn babies. He later recanted his pro-abortion activity and wrote what may be the quintessential book defending an unborn child’s right to life, “Aborting America.” Dr. Nathanson said, “There is no longer serious doubt in my mind that human life exists within the womb from the very onset of pregnancy.”</p>
<p>Dr. Mildred Jefferson was a surgeon at Boston University Medical Center, a diplomate of the American Board of Surgery with many honors and awards. She said, “Many people try to hide behind the confusion of not knowing what happens before a baby is born. But we do not have to be confused. We in medicine and science have a different name for every stage of the development of the baby, but it does not matter at all whether you know those names or not. When a young woman has not had much opportunity to go to school and she becomes pregnant, no one has to tell her that she is going to have a baby.</p>
<p>“I became a doctor in the tradition that is represented in the Bible of looking upon medicine as a high calling. I will not stand aside and have this great profession of mine, of the doctor, give up the designation of healer to become that of the social executioner. The Supreme Court Justices only had to hand down an order. Social workers only have to make arrangements, but it has been given to my profession to destroy the life of the innocent and the helpless.</p>
<p>“Today it is the unborn child; tomorrow it is likely to be the elderly or those who are incurably ill. Who knows but that a little later it may be anyone who has political or moral views that do not fit into the distorted new order? To that question, ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’ I answer ‘Yes.’ It is everyone’s responsibility to safeguard and preserve life. A child is a member of the human family and deserves care and concern.”</p>
<p>How many physicians, scientists, teachers, artists, musicians, pastors, missionaries, statesmen, musicians, businessmen, tradesmen, engineers, and notable contributors to society have been murdered in the womb since abortion-on-demand was legalized in this country? Millions, I’m sure.</p>
<p>At this point, I can hear someone interrupting, “What about cases involving rape or incest?”</p>
<p>While these cases number less than 1% of pregnancies, consider this case history: a 12-year-old girl was raped and became pregnant. “Get an abortion,” you say? Congratulations! You just killed Ethel Waters. The manner in which a baby was conceived in no way diminishes the human worth of the baby. Since when do we kill children for the sins of one parent?</p>
<p>And as Dr. Jefferson said, just where does the acceptance of abortion lead? Does anyone remember Baby Doe in Bloomington, Indiana?</p>
<p>A little baby was born April 9, 1982, with Down’s syndrome in a Bloomington, Indiana, hospital. The parents refused to allow a doctor to correct a defect in the esophagus that prevented eating, because the child was born with Down’s. The Indiana Supreme Court upheld the parents’ right to make this decision. When news of this atrocity got out, adoption offers came in from all over America. Several members of the medical staff who were aghast that such a thing could happen in their hospital resigned over the incident. An appeal was quickly started, but Baby Doe died of starvation on April 15, 1982. There is no doubt that this case, and many others similar to it, are directly related to the Roe v Wade decision that, in effect, makes babies nothing more than the property of the state with no human rights ascribed to them.</p>
<p>Add to this blatant disrespect for human life the new socialized, mandated government-run health care system now in effect&#8211;complete with cost-related rationing of medical treatments&#8211;and one can only imagine how the value of human life will continue to decline in this country. We are already hearing multiple reports of people who are not able to have surgical procedures because of all of the government red-tape and the uncertainty of physicians and hospitals as to whether the government will authorize payment.</p>
<p>I suggest that everyone start taking care of themselves and trying to stay healthy, because, under Obamacare, illness could become a death sentence&#8211;not because of the illness, but because of the lack of proper medical treatment due to the rationing of health care by government-imposed financial stipulations.</p>
<p>Plus, if you want to do some personal research that will really send chills up your spine, start investigating the fact that many scientists and researchers are seriously discussing genetic manipulation and genetic engineering. Our own government and military are already culpable in grotesque medical experimentation on both civilian and military personnel.</p>
<p>Our own Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has admitted to using military personnel as human guinea pigs for medical, biological, and mental experimentation under various programs associated with the now-infamous title, MK-ULTRA. CIA officials say the programs have all been scrapped. Don’t you believe it.</p>
<p>In addition, consider the testimony of Dr. Carolyn Gerster, a physician specializing in internal medicine and cardiopulmonary diseases. She obtained her medical degree from the University Of Oregon Medical School in Portland.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerster told Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Forum, “I was asked to become a member of the American College of Physicians many years ago. It’s an honorary society of internal medicine. I was very proud right up until the day that the society gave the James D. Bruce Award for Medical Research to Dr. Saul Krugman for the following experiment. Dr. Krugman had taken living hepatitis virus MS2 and injected this living virus into 25 retarded children in Willowbrook Home for the Retarded in upstate New York. This was defended on the basis that they would probably get the hepatitis virus anyway.”</p>
<p>Consider, too, that contrary to what most people assume, the vast majority of physicians graduating from medical school today no longer take a Hippocratic-type oath&#8211;an oath that binds physicians to the following: “I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone. I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary [medical device] to cause an abortion.”</p>
<p>As Schaeffer and Koop pointed out in their book, “Whatever Happened to the Human Race?” “The Declaration of Geneva (adopted in September 1948 by the General Assembly of the World Medical Organization and modeled closely on the Hippocratic Oath) became used as the graduation oath by more and more medical schools. It includes: ‘I will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of conception.’ This concept of the preservation of human life has been the basis of the medical profession and society in general. It is significant that when the University of Pittsburgh changed from the Hippocratic Oath to the Declaration of Geneva in 1971, the students deleted ‘from the time of conception’ from the clause.”</p>
<p>Today, the ageless principles that had guided the medical profession throughout Western Civilization have been expunged from a majority of our physicians’ training and practice. And the Roe Supreme Court decision had much to do with it.</p>
<p>What is especially irritating about the whole abortion debate is the way the subject has been used as a political football by those on both the right and the left of the political aisle. While the national Democratic Party proudly touts itself as being “pro-choice,” it has been the so-called “pro-life” Republican Party that is mostly to blame for legalized abortion being left as the law of the land for over four decades.</p>
<p>Think of it: the GOP has dominated US Supreme Court appointments for the 41 years since the Roe decision. In fact, the 1973 court that released the Roe decision was a Republican-appointed court by a 6-3 margin. The same GOP-dominated court also rendered the Doe v. Bolton Supreme Court decision reaffirming Roe.</p>
<p>Consider still: the “pro-life” Republican Party controlled the entire federal government from the election of 2000 to the election of 2006: six long years of GOP domination of both houses of Congress, the White House, and the US Supreme Court. And in all of that time, not one single unborn baby’s life was saved. Not one!</p>
<p>And, yet, each year, former Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) would introduce the Sanctity of Life Act. And each year, the bill would sit in the document room of the Capitol Building and gather dust. What would Rep. Paul’s bill have done? (1) It would have defined unborn babies as persons under the law. (2) Under the authority of Article. III. Section. 2. of the US Constitution, it would have removed abortion from the jurisdiction of the court. Had the “pro-life” Republican congress passed Dr. Paul’s bill, and the “pro-life” President, G. W. Bush, signed it into law, Roe v. Wade would have been effectively overturned.</p>
<p>So, why didn’t President Bush trumpet the bill? Where was the Republican leader in the Senate? Where was the Republican Speaker of the House? Where was Orrin Hatch? Where was John McCain? Where was Lindsey Graham? Where was the National Right to Life Committee? Where were the tens of thousands of “pro-life” pastors and Christians?</p>
<p>Not only that: these same “pro-life” pastors, church members, and conservatives refused to support Congressman Ron Paul for President in 2008, and again in 2012, because he was not “conservative” enough. Actually, they opposed him because he opposed the war in Iraq, which means they would rather support a politician who promotes taking America into unconstitutional wars&#8211;and who will do nothing to overturn Roe v Wade and save the lives of unborn babies&#8211;than support a man who insisted that the Constitution be followed, and actually had a constitutional plan to overturn Roe v Wade and end abortion-on-demand as a national “right.” No wonder Jesus noted that unbelievers often have it over believers in the brains department. (See Luke 16:8.)</p>
<p>I remind you that securing life and liberty is the primary purpose of government (read the Declaration of Independence). Should it surprise us that the same government that feels no responsibility to protect the lives of innocent unborn children would feel any responsibility to protect our liberties? No wonder this government seems hell-bent on destroying our personal liberties: the wanton slaughter of 55 million unborn babies has seared its conscience.</p>
<p>Worse yet is the manner in which our pastors and churches seem completely unsympathetic to the silent screams of the slaughtered unborn. How many pastors will even mention Roe v Wade in their pulpits this week? Most Christians will go through this week and never even give a second thought to the plight of the millions of unborn babies being legally murdered in this country. And, furthermore, their conscience will certainly not be pricked by anything they hear from the pastors in their pulpits this week&#8211;or any other week, for that matter.</p>
<p>Legalized abortion is a national holocaust; an affront to our national character; a contradiction of established principles subscribed to from the beginning of Western Civilization; an insult to the principles of our Declaration of Independence; a bane of our national spirit; and a stench in the nostrils of Almighty God. That we have allowed it to continue for 41 years now stands as an indictment against this generation of Americans (especially America’s Christians) and bodes ominously for the well-being of our posterity.</p>

			<p><strong>What really happened in the Ukrainian crisis?</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Ukrainedeal3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>It is freezing cold in Kiev, legendary city of golden domes on the banks of Dnieper River – cradle of ancient Russian civilisation and the most charming of East European capitals. It is a comfortable and rather prosperous place, with hundreds of small and cosy restaurants, neat streets, sundry parks and that magnificent river. The girls are pretty and the men are sturdy. Kiev is more relaxed than Moscow, and easier on the wallet. Though statistics say the Ukraine is broke and its people should be as poor as Africans, in reality they aren&#8217;t doing too badly, thanks to their fiscal imprudence. The government borrowed and spent freely, heavily subsidised housing and heating, and they brazenly avoided devaluation of the national currency and the austerity program prescribed by the IMF. This living on credit can go only so far: the Ukraine was doomed to default on its debts next month or sooner, and this is one of the reasons for the present commotion.</p>
<p>A tug-of-war between the East and the West for the future of Ukraine lasted over a month, and has ended for all practical purposes in a resounding victory for Vladimir Putin, adding to his previous successes in Syria and Iran. The trouble began when the administration of President Yanukovich went looking for credits to reschedule its loans and avoid default. There were no offers. They turned to the EC for help; the EC, chiefly Poland and Germany, seeing that the Ukrainian administration was desperate, prepared an association agreement of unusual severity.</p>
<p>The EC is quite hard on its new East European members, Latvia, Romania, Bulgaria et al.: these countries had their industry and agriculture decimated, their young people working menial jobs in Western Europe, their population drop exceeded that of the WWII.</p>
<p>But the association agreement offered to the Ukraine was even worse. It would turn the Ukraine into an impoverished colony of the EC without giving it even the dubious advantages of membership (such as freedom of work and travel in the EC). In desperation, Yanukovich agreed to sign on the dotted line, in vain hopes of getting a large enough loan to avoid collapse. But the EC has no money to spare – it has to provide for Greece, Italy, Spain. Now Russia entered the picture. At the time, relations of the Ukraine and Russia were far from good. Russians had become snotty with their oil money, the Ukrainians blamed their troubles on Russians, but Russia was still the biggest market for Ukrainian products.</p>
<p>For Russia, the EC agreement meant trouble: currently the Ukraine sells its output in Russia with very little customs protection; the borders are porous; people move freely across the border, without even a passport. If the EC association agreement were signed, the EC products would flood Russia through the Ukrainian window of opportunity. So Putin spelled out the rules to Yanukovich: if you sign with the EC, Russian tariffs will rise. This would put some 400,000 Ukrainians out of work right away. Yanukovich balked and refused to sign the EC agreement at the last minute. (I predicted this in my report from Kiev full three weeks before it happened, when nobody believed it – a source of pride).</p>
<p>The EC, and the US standing behind it, were quite upset. Besides the loss of potential economic profit, they had another important reason: they wanted to keep Russia farther away from Europe, and they wanted to keep Russia weak. Russia is not the Soviet Union, but some of the Soviet disobedience to Western imperial designs still lingers in Moscow: be it in Syria, Egypt, Vietnam, Cuba, Angola, Venezuela or Zimbabwe, the Empire can’t have its way while the Russian bear is relatively strong. Russia without the Ukraine can’t be really powerful: it would be like the US with its Mid-western and Pacific states chopped away. The West does not want the Ukraine to prosper, or to become a stable and strong state either, so it cannot join Russia and make <i>it</i> stronger. A weak, poor and destabilised Ukraine in semi-colonial dependence to the West with some NATO bases is the best future for the country, as perceived by Washington or Brussels.</p>
<p>Angered by this last-moment-escape of Yanukovich, the West activated its supporters. For over a month, Kiev has been besieged by huge crowds bussed from all over the Ukraine, bearing a local strain of the Arab Spring in the far north. Less violent than Tahrir, their Maidan Square became a symbol of struggle for the European strategic future of the country. The Ukraine was turned into the latest battle ground between the US-led alliance and a rising Russia. Would it be a revanche for Obama’s Syria debacle, or another heavy strike at fading American hegemony?</p>
<p>The simple division into “pro-East” and “pro-West” has been complicated by the heterogeneity of the Ukraine. The loosely knit country of differing regions is quite similar in its makeup to the Yugoslavia of old. It is another post-Versailles hotchpotch of a country made up after the First World War of bits and pieces, and made independent after the Soviet collapse in 1991. Some parts of this “Ukraine” were incorporated by Russia 500 years ago, the Ukraine proper (a much smaller parcel of land, bearing this name) joined Russia 350 years ago, whilst the Western Ukraine (called the “Eastern Regions”) was acquired by Stalin in 1939, and the Crimea was incorporated in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic by Khrushchev in 1954.</p>
<p>The Ukraine is as Russian as the South-of-France is French and as Texas and California are American. Yes, some hundreds years ago, Provence was independent from Paris, &#8211; it had its own language and art; while Nice and Savoy became French rather recently. Yes, California and Texas joined the Union rather late too. Still, we understand that they are – by now – parts of those larger countries, ifs and buts notwithstanding. But if they were forced to secede, they would probably evolve a new historic narrative stressing the French ill treatment of the South in the Cathar Crusade, or dispossession of Spanish and Russian residents of California.</p>
<p>Accordingly, since the Ukraine’s independence, the authorities have been busy nation-building, enforcing a single official language and creating a new national myth for its 45 million inhabitants. The crowds milling about the Maidan were predominantly (though not exclusively) arrivals from Galicia, a mountainous county bordering with Poland and Hungary, 500 km (300 miles) away from Kiev, and natives of the capital refer to the Maidan gathering as a “Galician occupation”.</p>
<p>Like the fiery Bretons, the Galicians are fierce nationalists, bearers of a true Ukrainian spirit (whatever <i>that</i> means). Under Polish and Austrian rule for centuries, whilst the Jews were economically powerful, they are a strongly anti-Jewish and anti-Polish lot, and their modern identity centred around their support for Hitler during the WWII, accompanied by the ethnic cleansing of their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia">Polish</a> and <a href="http://www.academia.edu/1071581/The_Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army_UPA_and_the_Holocaust">Jewish</a> neighbours. After the WWII, the remainder of pro-Hitler Galician SS fighters were adopted by US Intelligence, re-armed and turned into a guerrilla force against the Soviets. They added an anti-Russian line to their two ancient hatreds and kept fighting the “forest war” until 1956, and these ties between the Cold Warriors have survived the thaw.</p>
<p>After 1991, when the independent Ukraine was created, in the void of state-building traditions, the Galicians were lauded as &#8216;true Ukrainians’, as they were the only Ukrainians who ever wanted independence. Their language was used as the basis of a new national state language, their traditions became enshrined on the state level. Memorials of Galician Nazi collaborators and mass murderers Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych peppered the land, often provoking the indignation of other Ukrainians. The Galicians played an important part in the 2004 Orange Revolution as well, when the results of presidential elections were declared void and the pro-Western candidate Mr Yuschenko got the upper hand in the re-run.</p>
<p>However, in 2004, many Kievans also supported Yuschenko, hoping for the Western alliance and a bright new future. Now, in 2013, the city&#8217;s support for the Maidan was quite low, and the people of Kiev complained loudly about the mess created by the invading throngs: felled trees, burned benches, despoiled buildings and a lot of biological waste. Still, Kiev is home to many NGOs; city intellectuals receive generous help from the US and EC. The old comprador spirit is always strongest in the capitals.</p>
<p>For the East and Southeast of the Ukraine, the populous and heavily industrialised regions, the proposal of association with the EC is a no-go, with no ifs, ands or buts. They produce coal, steel, machinery, cars, missiles, tanks and aircraft. Western imports would erase Ukrainian industry right off the map, as the EC officials freely admit. Even the Poles, hardly a paragon of industrial development, had the audacity to say to the Ukraine: we’ll do the technical stuff, you&#8217;d better invest in agriculture. This is easier to say than to do: the EC has a lot of regulations that make Ukrainian products unfit for sale and consumption in Europe. Ukrainian experts estimated their expected losses for entering into association with the EC at anything from 20 to 150 billion euros.</p>
<p>For Galicians, the association would work fine. Their speaker at the Maidan called on the youth to ‘go where you can get money’ and do not give a damn for industry. They make their income in two ways: providing bed-and breakfast rooms for Western tourists and working in Poland and Germany as maids and menials. They hoped they would get visa-free access to Europe and make a decent income for themselves. Meanwhile, nobody offered them a visa-waiver arrangement. The Brits mull over leaving the EC, because of the Poles who flooded their country; the Ukrainians would be too much for London. Only the Americans, always generous at somebody’s else expense, demanded the EC drop its visa requirement for them.</p>
<p>While the Maidan was boiling, the West sent its emissaries, ministers and members of parliament to cheer the Maidan crowd, to call for President Yanukovich to resign and for a revolution to install pro-Western rule. Senator McCain went there and made a few firebrand speeches. The EC declared Yanukovich “illegitimate” because so many of his citizens demonstrated against him. But when millions of French citizens demonstrated against their president, when Occupy Wall Street was violently dispersed, nobody thought the government of France or the US president had lost legitimacy…</p>
<p>Victoria Nuland, the Assistant Secretary of State, shared her biscuits with the demonstrators, and demanded from the oligarchs support for the “European cause” or their businesses would suffer. The Ukrainian oligarchs are very wealthy, and they prefer the Ukraine as it is, sitting on the fence between the East and the West. They are afraid that the Russian companies will strip their assets should the Ukraine join the Customs Union, and they know that they are not competitive enough to compete with the EC. Pushed now by Nuland, they were close to falling on the EC side.</p>
<p>Yanukovich was in big trouble. The default was rapidly approaching. He annoyed the pro-Western populace, and he irritated his own supporters, the people of the East and Southeast. The Ukraine had a real chance of collapsing into anarchy. A far-right nationalist party, Svoboda (Liberty), probably the nearest thing to the Nazi party to arise in Europe since 1945, made a bid for power. The EC politicians accused Russia of pressurising the Ukraine; Russian missiles suddenly emerged in the western-most tip of Russia, a few minutes flight from Berlin. The Russian armed forces discussed the US strategy of a “disarming first strike”. The tension was very high.</p>
<p>Edward Lucas, the <i>Economist&#8217;s</i> international editor and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Cold-War-Putins/dp/B005FOIQMU">The New Cold War</a>, is a hawk of the Churchill and Reagan variety. For him, Russia is an enemy, whether ruled by Tsar, by Stalin or by Putin. He <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304744304579250241092282888">wrote</a>: “It is no exaggeration to say that the [Ukraine] determines the long-term future of the entire former Soviet Union. If Ukraine adopts a Euro-Atlantic orientation, then the Putin regime and its satrapies are finished… But if Ukraine falls into Russia&#8217;s grip, then the outlook is bleak and dangerous&#8230; Europe&#8217;s own security will also be endangered. NATO is already struggling to protect the Baltic states and Poland from the integrated and increasingly impressive military forces of Russia and Belarus. Add Ukraine to that alliance, and a headache turns into a nightmare.”</p>
<p>In this cliff-hanging situation, Putin made his pre-emptive strike. At a meeting in the Kremlin, he agreed to buy fifteen billion euros worth of Ukrainian Eurobonds and cut the natural gas price by a third. This meant there would be no default; no massive unemployment; no happy hunting ground for the neo-Nazi thugs of Svoboda; no cheap and plentiful Ukrainian prostitutes and menials for the Germans and Poles; and Ukrainian homes will be warm this Christmas. Better yet, the presidents agreed to reforge their industrial cooperation. When Russia and Ukraine formed a single country, they built spaceships; apart, they can hardly launch a naval ship. Though unification isn’t on the map yet, it would make sense for both partners. This artificially divided country can be united, and it would do a lot of good for both of their populaces, and for all people seeking freedom from US hegemony.</p>
<p>There are a lot of difficulties ahead: Putin and Yanukovich are not friends, Ukrainian leaders are prone to renege, the US and the EC have a lot of resources. But meanwhile, it is a victory to celebrate this Christmas tide. Such victories keep Iran safe from US bombardment, inspire the Japanese to demand removal of Okinawa base, encourage those seeking closure of Guantanamo jail, cheer up Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, frighten the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">NSA</a> and CIA and allow French Catholics to march against Hollande’s child-trade laws.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What is the secret of Putin’s success? Edward Lucas said, in an interview to the pro-Western <i>Ekho Moskvy</i> radio: “Putin had a great year &#8211; Snowden, Syria, Ukraine. He checkmated Europe. He is a great player: he notices our weaknesses and turns them into his victories. He is good in diplomatic bluff, and in the game of Divide and Rule. He makes the Europeans think that the US is weak, and he convinced the US that Europeans are useless”.</p>
<p>I would offer an alternative explanation. The winds and hidden currents of history respond to those who feel their way. Putin is no less likely a roguish leader of global resistance than Princess Leia or Captain Solo were in <i>Star Wars</i>. Just the time for such a man is ripe.</p>
<p>Unlike Solo, he is not an adventurer. He is a prudent man. He does not try his luck, he waits, even procrastinates. He did not try to change regime in Tbilisi in 2008, when his troops were already on the outskirts of the city. He did not try his luck in Kiev, either. He has spent many hours in many meetings with Yanukovich whom he supposedly personally dislikes.</p>
<p>Like Captain Solo, Putin is a man who is ready to pay his way, full price, and such politicians are rare. “Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman&#8217;s mouth?”, asked a James Joyce character, and answered: “His proudest boast is <i>I paid my way</i>.” Those were Englishmen of another era, long before the likes of Blair, <i>et al.</i></p>
<p>While McCain and Nuland, Merkel and Bildt speak of the European choice for the Ukraine, none of them is ready to pay for it. Only Russia is ready to pay her way, in the Joycean sense, whether in cash, as now, or in blood, as in WWII.</p>
<p>Putin is also a magnanimous man. He celebrated his Ukrainian victory and forthcoming Christmas by forgiving his personal and political enemies and setting them free: the Pussy Riot punks, Khodorkovsky the murderous oligarch, rioters… And his last press conference he carried out in Captain Solo self-deprecating mode, and this, for a man in his position, is a very good sign.</p>

<p>For a long time now holocaust revisionists, aka &#8220;deniers&#8221;, have occupied a spot in the public&#8217;s esteem somewhere below pedophiles and just above serial killers. Now, a new contender for the penultimate position in the scale of public opprobrium has emerged: global warming &#8220;deniers&#8221;. The debate-squelching term has been applied to the likes of Richard Lindtzen, professor emeritus of meteorology at MIT; Roger Pielke Sr., professor emeritus of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State; and Patrick Michaels, past president of the American Association of State Climatologists. A while back, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-pelley-and-catherine-herrick-on-global-warming-coverage/" target="_blank">Scott Pelley</a> of CBS News directly linked the two sets of heretics.</p>
<p>As with holocaust deniers, who enjoyed a brief exposure in the national media in the early 1990s but have since been banned from the airwaves, attempts are being made to deny global warming skeptics access to the podium. The <em><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/10/18/la-times-bans-letters-from-climate-skeptics/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a></em> recently banned &#8220;factually inaccurate&#8221; letters to the editor skeptical of human-caused climate change. In November, Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for <i>The Nation, </i>accused Piers Morgan of being &#8220;journalistically irresponsible&#8221; for allowing a denier, Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama-Huntsville, on his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcpvONxkRCo" target="_blank">program</a> (Hertsgaard, who I suspect has a degree in Art History or the like, admonished Dr. Spencer, a former senior climate scientist at NASA, telling him he &#8220;needs to read more scientific papers&#8221;, to which Dr. Spencer graciously responded &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a feeling I&#8217;ve read more than you have, Mark&#8221;.)</p>
<p>Like holocaust denial, global warming denial can be hazardous to your career. In her inaugural address to Department of the Interior staff, the newly-appointed Secretary, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/02/sally-jewell-climate-change-deniers_n_3695153.html" target="_blank">Sally Jewell</a>, warned &#8220;“I hope there are no climate-change deniers in the Department of Interior” (She&#8217;s probably checking the closets right now). <a href="http://www.weather.com/blog/weather/8_11392.html" target="_blank">Heidi Cullen</a>, host of The Weather Channel&#8217;s &#8220;The Climate Code&#8221;, has called for the American Meteorologist Society to decertify weathermen who express skepticism about human activity causing climate change. And in Oregon, Governor <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/jan-june07/northwest_06-21.html" target="_blank">Ted Kulongoski</a>, sought to strip Professor George Taylor of the honorary title &#8220;State Climatologist&#8221;, bestowed on him by Oregon State, because of his anti-warmist views.</p>
<p>Fortunately, global warming denial has not been criminalized as has holocaust denial in Europe&#8230; yet. But <a href="http://leftofthemark.com/quote/robert-f-kennedy-jr-global-warming-skeptics-are-traitors" target="_blank">RFK Jr.</a> once accused supposed financial backers of global warming denial, like Exxon-Mobil, of treason, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080208132916/http:/www.mcgilldaily.com/view.php?aid=6970" target="_blank">David Suzuki</a>, a well-known Canadian environmentalist, urged his fans to find a way to throw global warming denying politicians in jail because &#8220;what they’re doing is a criminal act&#8221;. <a href="http://grist.org/article/on-climate-denialists-and-nuremberg/" target="_blank">David Roberts</a> of Grist went ballistic in an op-ed in that online mag, labeling climate change denial a &#8220;war crime&#8221; worthy of a Nuremberg-type prosecution. Thankfully, we don&#8217;t prosecute holocaust deniers in this country, and I think it unlikely their global warming co-defendants will suffer that fate either.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one final similarity between holocaust and global warming deniers: they&#8217;re both beginning to win the debate. Success for the global warming skeptics derives from the fact the earth hasn&#8217;t warmed in over a decade, something the models didn&#8217;t predict. In groping for an explanation, warmists have resorted to arguments very similar to those employed by holocaust believers. For instance, in testimony before Congress recently, <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/misleading-congressional-climate-testimony-christy-pielke.html" target="_blank">David Titley</a>, Deputy Under Secretary for Operations at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in trying to explain the lack of evidence for climate change-induced severe weather, argued &#8220;The Absence of Evidence is not the Evidence of Absence&#8221;, echoing the holocaust believers&#8217; argument that the absence of any evidence of gas chambers is not evidence that gas chambers never existed. Dedicated and courageous scholars &#8211; often writing under pseudonyms for obvious reasons &#8211; have debunked the major holocaust myths to my satisfaction. If the Russian archives are ever opened fully, I&#8217;m sure the revelations they contain will be sufficient to convince the rest of you.</p>
<p>So, if over the next few years, the <a href="http://www.climate.gov/" target="_blank">mean global temperature</a> fails to rise, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25383373?postId=118192465" target="_blank">arctic sea ice</a> recovers its former extent, <a href="http://www.climatedepot.com/2013/07/18/prof-roger-pielke-jr-testimony-on-the-current-state-of-weather-extremes-it-is-misleading-and-just-plain-incorrect-to-claim-that-disasters-associated-with-hurricanes-tornadoes-floods-or-d/" target="_blank">severe weather events</a> don&#8217;t increase in intensity or frequency, the polar bears continue to thrive (while you&#8217;re shedding a tear for the forlorn polar bears drifting towards extinction on their ever-shrinking ice floes, remember the poor penguins, who now have to walk 22 miles further to reach the sea because of the record <a href="http://www.livescience.com/39720-antarctica-ice-record-highs-2013.html" target="_blank">ice extent in the Antarctic</a>), and you find yourself listening with increased respect to what the global warming deniers have to say, please consider whether those other more venerable, even more denigrated deniers might, too, have something to say worth listening to. In fact, why wait? (a good place to start is <a href="http://www.codoh.com/" target="_blank">The Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust</a>)</p>

<p>In the Palestinian Solidarity Movement we really love celebrities – those famous, rather special people who write great books, play musical instruments  (drums included) or even just think great thoughts. We like those people to stand up for Palestine and denounce ‘Zionism’, ‘Israeli Colonialism’ and ‘Apartheid.’  We love them  &#8211; as long as they don’t say what they really think. </p>
<p>Here’s the problem. Celebrities are often famous and successful because they’re clever and independent. Unlike our  progressive, dysfunctional activists, who in most cases lives on income support and repeat our ‘party line’, the celebrity is a confident, career-oriented, self-sufficient subject and, because of their capacity to make autonomous decisions, he or she is assertive and thriving . In short, the activist and the celebrity are made of very different stuff – so a collision is inevitable.</p>
<p>Time after time it happens to us in the Palestinian Solidarity Movement. We manage to pull in a great human being, we tell them what to say and they comply. For a while, they call to boycott Israel and, like parrots, they repeat our slogans. But then, against all odds, these damn, self-centred stars start to speak their minds.</p>
<p>Roger Waters is obviously such a celebrity. For the last two years we were so proud of our Pink Floyd comrade rallying for Palestine. For a while, he repeated our slogans, denouncing colonialism and Israeli Apartheid. But then, the inevitable happened.  For no obvious reason he told the truth. In an interview on Counterpunch he equated Israel with Nazi Germany and, speaking about Jewish power, he even mentioned the ‘J word’.</p>
<p>Within hours, all hell broke loose. Every Jewish media outlet, including The Guardian unleashed its venom in order to bring Roger to his knees. Rabbis, Holocaust memory merchants and even artists were recruited to join the choir. But guess what? Not one single Palestinian activist stood up for Waters. Neither Electronic Intifada nor Jewish progressive Mondoweiss supported the legendary bassist. Their silence was deafening.  The progressive, Cohen Blumenthal also didn’t show any support for the truth teller. Is this a coincidence?</p>
<p>Our sycophantic Solidarity Movement dropped Roger Waters like a stone as we’ve done so many times before because, in our little progressive ghetto, we love celebrities &#8211; but not when speak their minds or tell the truth. </p>

<p><em>Until 1994 he was a producer-arranger for various Israeli Dance &amp; Rock Projects, performing in Europe and the USA playing ethnic music as well as R&amp;R and Jazz.</em></p>
<p><em>Coming to the UK in 1994, Atzmon recovered an interest in playing the music of the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe that had been in the back of his mind for years. In 2000 he founded the Orient House Ensemble in London and started re-defining his own roots in the light of his emerging political awareness.

<p>Inflammatory remarks by the musician <a title="More from the Guardian on Roger Waters" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/roger-waters">Roger Waters</a>, formerly of <a title="" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd">Pink Floyd</a>, comparing the modern Israeli state to Nazi Germany have put him at the centre of a furious dispute.</p>
<p>Performers and religious figures reacted angrily to the veteran rock star&#8217;s argument that Israeli treatment of the Palestinians can be compared to the atrocities of Nazi Germany. &#8220;The parallels with what went on in the 1930s in Germany are so crushingly obvious,&#8221; he said in an American online interview last week.</p>
<p>Waters, 70, a <a title="link to Waters comment in 2011" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/11/cultural-boycott-west-bank-wall">well-known supporter of the Palestinian cause</a>, has frequently defended himself against accusations that he is antisemitic, claiming he has a right to urge fellow artists to boycott <a title="More from the Guardian on Israel" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>.</p>
<p>This summer he was criticised for using a pig-shaped balloon adorned with Jewish symbols, including a Star of David, as one part of the stage effects at his concerts. Waters countered that it was just one of several religious and political symbols in the show and not an attempt to single out Judaism as an evil force.</p>
<p>Now leading American thinker Rabbi Shmuley Boteach has raised the stakes <a title="link to piece in New York Observer" href="http://observer.com/2013/12/the-anti-semitic-stench-of-pink-floyd/">by describing Waters&#8217; views as audacious and clearly antisemitic</a>.</p>
<p>Writing in the <a title="" href="http://observer.com/2013/12/the-anti-semitic-stench-of-pink-floyd/"><em>New York Observer</em></a>, the rabbi said: &#8220;Mr Waters, the Nazis were a genocidal regime that murdered six million Jews. That you would have the audacity to compare Jews to monsters who murdered them shows you have no decency, you have no heart, you have no soul.&#8221; The rabbi was responding to Waters&#8217;s latest comments on the Middle East.<a title="link to Counterpunch" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/06/an-interview-with-pink-floyds-roger-waters/">Speaking to the leftwing <em>CounterPunch</em> magazine</a>, the musician criticised the US government for being unduly influenced by the Israeli &#8220;propaganda machine&#8221;.</p>
<p>The former <a title="More from the Guardian on Pink Floyd" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd">Pink Floyd</a> frontman, who has recently toured the world with a show based on the influential 1979 album <em>The Wall</em>, went on to describe the Israeli rabbinate as &#8220;bizarre&#8221; and accused them of believing that Palestinians and other Arabs in the Middle East were &#8220;sub-human&#8221;. Waters suggested the &#8220;Jewish lobby&#8221; was &#8220;extraordinarily powerful&#8221;. On the subject of the Holocaust, he said: &#8220;There were many people that pretended that the oppression of the Jews was not going on. From 1933 until 1946. So this is not a new scenario. Except that this time it&#8217;s the Palestinian people being murdered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking from New York on Saturday night, Waters strongly rejected Rabbi Boteach&#8217;s characterisation of his views. He said: &#8220;I do not know Rabbi Boteach, and am not prepared to get into a slanging match with him. I will say this: I have nothing against Jews or Israelis, and I am not antisemitic. I deplore the policies of the Israeli government in the occupied territories and Gaza. They are immoral, inhuman and illegal. I will continue my non-violent protests as long as the government of Israel continues with these policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Rabbi Boteach can make a case for the Israel government&#8217;s policies, I look forward to hearing it. It is difficult to make arguments to defend the Israeli government&#8217;s policies, so would-be defenders often use a diversionary tactic, they routinely drag the critic into a public arena and accuse them of being an antisemite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waters continued: &#8220;The Holocaust was brutal and disgusting beyond our imagination. We must never forget it. We must always remain vigilant. We must never stand by silent and indifferent to the sufferings of others, whatever their race, colour, ethnic background or religion. All human beings deserve the right to live equally under the law.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="link to Guardian profile" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/karen-pollock">Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust</a>, said: &#8220;Everyone is entitled to an opinion and to advocate passionately for a cause, but drawing inappropriate parallels with the Holocaust insults the memory of the six million Jews – men, women and children – murdered by the Nazis. These kinds of attacks are commonly used as veiled antisemitism and should be exposed as such.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jo-Ann Mort, vice-chair of US Jewish group Americans for Peace Now, is calling for musicians and other entertainers to go to Israel to understand that there is also Israeli opposition to discrimination against Arabs. Speaking to the <em>Observer</em> from California, she said it was important for international performers to &#8220;speak their mind to audiences about the nation&#8217;s successes and failures. Just as Israeli musicians – Jewish, Muslim and Christian – do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The media in Israel flock to foreign entertainers. Performers would have the opportunity to make their viewpoints known – and it will also help to break the logjam that fundamentalists have had on both sides,&#8221; she argued.</p>
<p>Mort supports the <a title="link to Huffpo interview" href="http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/arab-and-jew-david-broza/52a5e15cfe3444790b000492">anti-boycott approach of Israeli singer and activist David Broza</a>, whose forthcoming album <a title="" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/East-Jerusalem-West-David-Broza/dp/B00H9WAPOS"><em>East Jerusalem/West Jerusalem</em></a>features covers of songs that urge understanding, including Waters&#8217;s own song Mother, from the album <em>The Wall</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Music captivates your head and your mind,&#8221; Broza recently argued. &#8220;If it comes with good vibes, then everyone wants to be part of it. The hard work comes from having a belief in what you are doing and in not stopping at the barricades that are posted at every corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week Waters&#8217;s words drew a strong response from the <a title="" href="http://www.thecst.org.uk/">Community Security Trust</a>, the body that monitors anti-Jewish activity in Britain. A spokesman told the <em>Jewish Chronicle</em> that Waters&#8217;s comments &#8220;echo the language of antisemitism&#8221; and added that the musician was &#8220;living proof of how easily people who pursue extreme anti-Israel politics can drift into antisemitic statements and ideas&#8221;.</p>
<p><a title="" href="http://www.bicom.org.uk/">Bicom,</a> the UK-based Israel advocacy organisation, also condemned Waters&#8217;s views. Chief executive Dermot Kehoe said: &#8220;The statements by Roger Waters calling for a cultural boycott of Israel and comparing the country to Nazi Germany are repugnant and fly in the face of both the reality in Israel today and the ongoing peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.&#8221;</p>
<p>In August Waters used his Facebook page to <a title="" href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/roger-waters-the-wall/an-open-letter-from-roger-waters/688037331210720">respond to allegations</a> that he was an &#8220;open hater of Jews&#8221;, made by Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in an interview with an American weekly Jewish newspaper, the <a title="" href="http://www.algemeiner.com/"><em>Algemeiner</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often I can ignore these attacks, but Rabbi Cooper&#8217;s accusations are so wild and bigoted they demand a response,&#8221; Waters wrote, adding that he had &#8220;many very close Jewish friends&#8221;.</p>

<p>For the next 12 Days before Christmas I will be <a href="https://twitter.com/wearewideawake">TWEETING the short link to this post </a>to the NY TIMES, such as this:</p>

<p>I also will be TWEETING it to every Media outlet I can find at <a href="https://twitter.com/wearewideawake">TWITTER</a>; but first a little background:</p>
<p>I learned about Vanunu while researching my first historical novel and wrote him into the Chapter <a href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1900&amp;Itemid=239">THANKSGIVING EVE 1987 </a></p>
<p>A few months later, I met Vanunu during my first of 8 journeys to both sides of The Wall in Israel Palestine and wrote that experience in the Chapter <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=940&amp;Itemid=201">16 Days in Israel Palestine</a><br />
<strong><br />
<a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-">The last time I saw Vanunu </a></strong>was a week before Thanksgiving 2013:</p>
<div><img title="b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" src="http://www.eileenfleming.org/images/easyblog_images/63/b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>One correction I have repeatedly addressed on the WWW is the <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26">legend of Cindy/Cheryl and the “honey trap”</a>:</p>
<p>When I asked Vanunu what he was thinking when he took off with Cindy, he maintained eye contact and readily replied,</p>
<p>“It wasn’t like THAT-when Maxwell’s paper published my photo without ever talking to me and some of the stolen Dimona photos with a very bad story against me, I knew the Mossad was after me. Cindy said she had a sister in Rome and I thought I would be safe there until I could return to London.</p>
<p>“We went to movies and art galleries. I trusted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, as soon as I got into the apartment, I was hit on the head and drugged. When I woke up and they took me for interrogation, they threw the Times article on the table and said, ‘Look, what you did.’ I was so relieved they had published it and that I had done what I did.”</p>
<p>What &#8216;Cindy&#8217; did was masquerade as an American beautician on holiday in London. In reality, &#8216;Cindy&#8217; was the American Mossad agent, Cheryl Hanin Bentov who was using her sister-in-laws passport!</p>
<p>It is illegal under American-Israeli diplomatic protocols for the Mossad to operate in America.</p>
<p><strong>MY Submissions to The New York Times:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nov. 6, 2013</strong><br />
<a href="mailto:oped@nytimes.com">oped@nytimes.com</a>,   <a href="mailto:publiceditor@nytimes.com">publiceditor@nytimes.com</a>,   <a href="mailto:letters@nytimes.com">letters@nytimes.com</a>,   <a href="mailto:opinion.video@nytimes.com">opinion.video@nytimes.com</a>,   <a href="mailto:editorial@nytimes.com">editorial@nytimes.com</a>,  <a href="mailto:opinion@nytimes.com">opinion@nytimes.com</a></p>
<p>Dear New York Times,</p>
<p>As the current leader of the <a href="https://www.causes.com/profiles/188026196/about">International Cause dedicated to help free Mordechai Vanunu</a>, I am informing you of Mordechai Vanunu&#8217;s mid December Appeal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-">On 6 December, Vanunu wrote:</a> &#8220;Court hearing against the restrictions not to leave Israel, schedule hearing in the Supreme court will be Dec&#8217; 16, 2013. The same Appeal was in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011<strong>. The court can send me free and end all this case from 1986-2013.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1986, Israel kidnapped Vanunu from Rome and after a closed door trial, convicted him of espionage and treason.   Although released on 21 April 2004, Israel has denied Vanunu the right to  &#8220;get on the first plane out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1985, Vanunu suffered a crisis of conscience, when he realized he was &#8220;a bolt&#8221; in the manufacturing of WMD.</p>
<p>After a supervisor carelessly left the keys in the shower room, Vanunu seized his opportunity to document top secret locations within Israel&#8217;s 7-story underground nuclear facility and he spent a few intense hours doing just that!</p>
<p>View Vanunu&#8217;s photos of the Dimona at his YouTube Channel:<br />

<p>A few months later, Vanunu leaves Israel and travels throughout Europe with the two rolls of undeveloped film.   After meeting Peter Hounam, a reporter for the London Sunday Times, Vanunu shares all he knew in his position as a mid-level technician and the two develop the film.</p>
<p>A total of 1,200 pages of transcript of Vanunu&#8217;s closed door trial have been released.<br />
Defense witness Peter Hounam stated, &#8220;We did not pay him money, but only covered his expenses&#8230;Money did not motivate him.&#8221;</p>
<p>During my conversations with <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26">Vanunu beginning in 2005, he told me:<br />
</a><br />
&#8220;All the secrets I had were published in 1989 in an important book, by [Nuclear Physicist] Frank Barnaby, <em><strong>The Invisible Bomb: Nuclear Arms Race in the Middle East.</strong></em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnaby testified, &#8220;I found Vanunu very straightforward about his motives for violating Israel&#8217;s secrecy laws he explained to me that he believed that both the Israeli and the world public had the right to know about the information he passed on. He seemed to me to be acting ideologically.<br />
<strong><br />
&#8220;Israel&#8217;s political leaders have, he said, consistently lied about Israel&#8217;s nuclear-weapons programme and he found this unacceptable in a democracy. </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The knowledge that Vanunu had about Israel&#8217;s nuclear weapons, about the operations at Dimona, and about security at Dimona could not be of any use to anyone today. He left Dimona in October 1985.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26"><br />
Vanunu also told me:<br />
</a><br />
“Did you know that President Kennedy tried to stop Israel from building atomic weapons? In 1963, he forced Prime Minister Ben Guirion to admit the Dimona was not a textile plant, as the sign outside proclaimed, but a nuclear plant. The Prime Minister said, ‘The nuclear reactor is only for peace.’</p>
<p>“Kennedy insisted on an open internal inspection. He wrote letters demanding that Ben Guirion open up the Dimona for inspection.</p>
<p>“The French were responsible for the actual building of the Dimona. The Germans gave the money; they were feeling guilty for the Holocaust, and tried to pay their way out.</p>
<p>“When Johnson became president, he made an agreement with Israel that two senators would come every year to inspect. Before the senators would visit, the Israelis would build a wall to block the underground elevators and stairways. From 1963 to ’69, the senators came, but they never knew about the wall that hid the rest of the Dimona from them.</p>
<p>“Nixon stopped the inspections and agreed to ignore the situation. As a result, Israel increased production. In 1986, there were over two hundred bombs. Today, they may have enough plutonium for ten bombs a year.”</p>

<p>Dear New York Times,</p>
<p>Photo of Mordechai Vanunu, by me 24 November 2013, east Jerusalem.</p>

<p>As the current leader of the <a href="https://www.causes.com/profiles/188026196/about">international cause dedicated to free Mordechai Vanunu </a>I write to alert you that on<a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-"> 9 December, Vanunu wrote:</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Changes in date, Court hearing against the restrictions not to leave Israel, schedule <strong>hearing in the Supreme court will be Dec&#8217; 25, 2013</strong>, moved from the Dec&#8217; 16, the same Appeal was 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. <strong>The court can send me free and end all this case from 1986-2013.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>The restrictions that have subjected Vanunu to 24/7 surveillance [his movements, phone calls and emails] since he emerged from 18 years behind bars on 21 April 2004, come from the Emergency Defense Regulations, which were implemented by Britain against Palestinians and Jews after World War II.</p>
<p>Attorney Yaccov Shapiro, who later became Israel&#8217;s Minister Of Justice, described the Emergency Defense Regulations as &#8220;unparalleled in any civilized country: there were no such laws in Nazi Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>View Vanunu moments after emerging from 18 years behind bars:</p>

<p>On 2 October 2009,<strong> The Washington Times</strong> reported that President Obama agreed to keep Israel&#8217;s nukes &#8216;secret&#8217; and reaffirmed a 4-decade-old understanding that has allowed Israel to keep a nuclear arsenal without opening it to international inspections.</p>
<p>Three officials spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were discussing private conversations, but all said Obama pledged to maintain the agreement when he first hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in May 2009.</p>
<p><strong>On 24, November 2006,</strong> Vanunu wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;My lawyer succeeded to reveal a few very important facts: This General of the Army also was not allowed to see all the secrets that he is required to protect by these restrictions that they claim I know them. So, he gave orders of restrictions without knowing what he is protecting or that he is also following orders blindly, and Mossad Sheen Bet using its authority for just punishing me.</p>
<p>&#8220;He testified that it is not a crime for me to talk with foreigners in general anywhere. He testified that I can speak freely to any Israeli citizens about anything; it is not his concern what I am saying to them. These Israelis can give this information to any foreigners. It was difficult for the Judge to understand why this dichotomy exits between foreigners and Israelis. It means that it is not about secrecy but about something else.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In 2004, </strong>Yossi Melman wrote for Haaretz:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the secret that hasn&#8217;t yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what he did, and the story of the subsequent attempts at cover-up, whitewashing and protection of senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will the New York Times shine a light on Israel&#8217;s Nuclear Whistle Blower&#8217;s nearly 10 year struggle for freedom from Israel before his Christmas Day appeal?</p>

<p>Imagine a documentary film about the Holocaust which makes no mention of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Imagine a documentary film about the 1965-66 slaughter of as many as a million “communists” in Indonesia which makes no mention of the key role in the killing played by the United States.</p>
<p>But there’s no need to imagine it. It’s been made, and was released this past summer. It’s called “The Act of Killing” and makes no mention of the American role. Two articles in the Washington Post about the film made no such mention either. The Indonesian massacre, along with the jailing without trial of about a million others and the widespread use of <a href="http://rinf.com/alt-news/?s=Torture">torture</a> and rape, ranks as one of the great crimes of the twentieth century and is certainly well known amongst those with at least a modest interest in modern history.</p>
<p>Here’s an email I sent to the Washington Post writer who reviewed the film:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fact that you can write about this historical event and not mention a word about the US government role is a sad commentary on your intellect and social conscience. If the film itself omits any serious mention of the US role, that is a condemnation of the filmmaker, and of you for not pointing this out. So the ignorance and brainwashing of the American people about their country’s foreign policy (i.e., holocaust) continues decade after decade, thanks to media people like Mr. Oppenheimer [one of the filmmakers] and yourself.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Post reviewer, rather than being offended by my intemperate language, was actually taken with what I said and she asked me to send her an article outlining the US role in Indonesia, which she would try to get published in the Post as an op-ed. I did so and she wrote me that she very much appreciated what I had sent her. But – as I was pretty sure would happen – the Post did not print what I wrote. So this incident may have had the sole saving grace of enlightening a Washington Post writer about the journalistic standards and politics of her own newspaper.</p>
<p>And now, just out, we have the film “Long Walk to Freedom” based on Nelson Mandela’s 1994 autobiography of the same name. The heroic Mandela spent close to 28 years in prison at the hands of the apartheid South African government. His arrest and imprisonment were the direct result of a CIA operation. But the film makes no mention of the role played by the CIA or any other agency of the United States.</p>
<p>In fairness to the makers of the film, Mandela himself, in his book, declined to accuse the CIA for his imprisonment, writing: “The story has never been confirmed and I have never seen any reliable evidence as to the truth of it.”</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Mandela and the filmmaker should read what I wrote and documented on the subject some years after Mandela’s book came out, in my own book: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1567511945/counterpunchmaga" target="_blank">Rogue State: a guide to the World’s Only Super Power</a> </em>(2000). It’s not quite a “smoking gun”, but I think it convinces almost all readers that what happened in South Africa in 1962 was another of the CIA operations we’ve all come to know and love. And almost all my sources were available to Mandela at the time he wrote his autobiography. There has been speculation about what finally led to Mandela’s release from prison; perhaps a deal was made concerning his post-prison behavior.</p>
<p>From a purely educational point of view, seeing films such as the two discussed here may well be worse than not exposing your mind at all to any pop culture treatment of American history or foreign policy.</p>
<p><strong>Getting your history from the American daily press</strong></p>
<p>During the US federal government shutdown in October over a budgetary dispute, Washington Post columnist Max Fisher wondered if there had ever been anything like this in another country. He decided that “there actually is one foreign precedent: Australia did this once. In 1975, the Australian government shut down because the legislature had failed to fund it, deadlocked by a budgetary squabble. It looked a lot like the U.S. shutdown of today, or the 17 previous U.S. shutdowns.”</p>
<p>Except for what Fisher fails to tell us: that it strongly appears that the CIA used the occasion to force a regime change in Australia, whereby the Governor General, John Kerr – a man who had been intimately involved with CIA fronts for a number of years – discharged Edward Gough Whitlam, the democratically-elected prime minister whose various policies had been a thorn in the side of the United States, and the CIA in particular.</p>
<p>I must again cite my own writing, for the story of the CIA coup in Australia – as far as I know – is not described in any kind of detail anywhere other than in my book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1567512526/counterpunchmaga" target="_blank">Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II</a></em> (2004).</p>

<p>It has been already established that just a few countries could produce Polonium let alone deliver it to the besieged Arafat’s Headquarters in Ramallah. The Palestinian committee investigating the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004 confirmed today that Israel is actually the &#8220;only suspect” in this murder case.</p>
<p>Yet, one question puzzles me. What did Israeli leaders had in mind when they decided to poison the Palestinian leader with a radioactive substance that would leave forensic traces in Arafat’s remains for millenniums to come?  What kind of a murderer consciously leaves fingerprints behind? After all, the decision to kill Arafat and in such a manner was taken by the Israel’s supreme decision makers. They must have closely examined the idea, the consequences and the means involved.</p>
<p>The more I look into it, I gather that the Israelis who took the decision to poison Arafat with radioactive polonium  came to the conclusion that the Goyim must be stupid, and they had a good reason to come to such a conclusion.  Bizarrely enough, earlier this week, when it became clear that Arafat’s body was indeed saturated with a radioactive substance, not a single Western leader saw the need to denounce Israel or call for an immediate probe of Israel nuclear industry. As if this is not enough, Israeli spokesmen ridiculed the recent scientific findings, tagging the media reports as a ‘soap opera.’  Clearly, they are convinced that Israel can get away with murder, and they are apparently correct.</p>
<p>Earlier this weekend we learned that instead of Israel, it is actually Iran’s nuclear project that is under growing international pressure. So here we are, while it becomes clear that Israel has been actively engaged in nuking the Palestinian leader, Western world leaders are shamelessly bowing to the Jewish Lobby and Saudi pressure mounting more pressure on Iran.</p>
<p>I guess that the Israelis do have a good reason to believe that the so-called Goyim are very stupid indeed. But such a reading of the unfolding events would mean a complete dismissal of Jewish history &#8211; an endless chain of holocausts. If Jewish history  teaches us something, it is always just a question of time before the Goyim say ‘enough is enough’.  The Israelis and their devoted lobbies, once again, misinterpret Gentiles’ tolerance as blunt stupidity. But I would kindly advise my ex-brethren to beware, time is running out for their horrid and sinister games.</p>

<p><em>Until 1994 he was a producer-arranger for various Israeli Dance &amp; Rock Projects, performing in Europe and the USA playing ethnic music as well as R&amp;R and Jazz.</em></p>
<p><em>Coming to the UK in 1994, Atzmon recovered an interest in playing the music of the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe that had been in the back of his mind for years. In 2000 he founded the Orient House Ensemble in London and started re-defining his own roots in the light of his emerging political awareness. Since then the Orient House Ensemble has toured all over the world. The Ensemble includes Eddie Hick on Drums, Yaron Stavi on Bass and Frank Harrison on piano &amp; electronics.</em></p>
