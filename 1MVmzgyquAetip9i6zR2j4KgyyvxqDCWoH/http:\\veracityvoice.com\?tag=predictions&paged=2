			<p><strong>Syrian Volunteers Exhibit Their Humanity, Despite International Politicizing of Emergency Aid&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ambulancedestroyed3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ambulancedestroyed2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Over the past twenty months, as the Syrian crisis continued beyond most early predictions, this observer learned something about the Syrian people that I had known for decades about Palestinians. And that is their great concern for their countrymen wherever they are found and whatever their current condition.  When I am in Syria I am frequently asked “how are our people doing in Lebanon as refugees from this crisis?”  In Lebanon, I am often asked “how are our (internal) refugees in Syria and what of our people in Jordan, Iraq or Turkey, how are they being treated and are they getting the basic necessities they need to live?”</p>
<p>And many Syrian refugees there are these bitter days. As of early November, 2012, close to 700,000 have fled their country with the UN now expecting close to one million by early next year if the fighting does not stop. Soon, it is likely that there will be close to 2 million displaced persons inside Syria according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). There are currently, according to the 10/12 UNHCR Syrian Refugee Report, 205,000 in Jordan, approximately 60,000 in Iraq (the first known refugees who have sought refuge in Iraq during the past quarter century) 110,649 in Turkey and 110,095 in Lebanon. The true figures are higher by an estimated 13% if one were to include the many Syrian refugees who are unable or do not want to register with local authorities or NGO’s for various reasons.</p>
<p>“Many more Syrians have recently been displaced within our borders and we are bracing for a long conflict.” Dr. Abdul Rahman Attar, Director of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent told this observer during a meeting in his Damascus office. Dr. Attar explained that “internally displaced persons” now exceed 1.5 million and close to 8.5% of the entire population have fled their homes during the last 19 months of conflict. Nearly 400,000 in Damascus alone.<strong>  </strong> Panos Moumtzis, UNHCR’s regional co-coordinator for Syrian refugee’s advised that more than 3,000 refugees flee to neighboring countries every day, or approximately 90,000 per month.  Both agree that due to the collapse of public services, and given that perhaps 1.2 million people need humanitarian aid inside the country, it brings the total number of Syrians requiring some form of relief to 2.7 million – or roughly 12 per cent of the total population.</p>
<p><strong>Politicizing Humanitarian Aid</strong></p>
<p>Whereas in Syria, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, official refugee camps are providing shelter at no cost to more than a quarter million Syrian refugees, the government in Lebanon has not yet permitted the construction of similar sites due to confessional fears that perhaps a political or other advantage might somehow accrue to a rival sect-once more exposing how deeply its current anarchist confessionalist arrangement paralyzes Lebanon. Unfortunately it is the same mentality and prejudices that so far has prevented Palestinian refugees in Lebanon from being granted the same elementary civil rights to work and to own a home that Syria and every other country granted the victims of the Zionist colonial enterprise usurpation of Palestine, six decades ago.</p>
<p>The number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon who fled the violence in their homeland have increased sectarian tensions with one result being Syrian workers and refugees being targeted by elements of the Lebanese government. This despite the enormous aid Syria gave Lebanese refugees during the 2006 war when hundreds of thousands of Lebanese sought safety next door in Syria.  Nadim Houry, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa for Human Rights Watch, has documented growing political harassment of Syrian workers in Lebanon. He reports: “We’ve seen the army and the police detaining and roughing up a number of Syrian workers. Most recently, the Lebanese army beat up 72 workers; most of them were Syrian,” Houry reported. “The Lebanese army rounded up the migrant men in the neighborhood and decided to ‘teach them a lesson’ instead of doing police work.”</p>
<p>Against this dismal backdrop one can find across the border in Syria hope and even inspiration.  It is coming from the Syrian people themselves and their mainly Arab friends.  Between 10,000 and 11,000 volunteers, including Iraqi and Palestinian refugees, are manning across Syria more than 80 Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society (SARC) aid “sub-stations.” These include more than a dozen mobile clinics and pharmacies as well as 10 “on the spot readiness centers.”  Depending on the level of localized conflict on any given day, SARC volunteers operate 24/7 anywhere from 6 and 30 ambulances, as they liaise with the Palestine Red Crescent Society volunteers, among others. Since mid-summer, SARC volunteers have been opening centers for psychological support services for children as well as adults. Recently a phone “hotline” has been set-up to help citizens find emergency help. International volunteers are most welcomed at any of SARC’s centers.</p>
<p>SARC’s volunteers have recently been praised by the UN World Food Program and many others for their work delivering humanitarian aid to internal refugees here in Syria. They distribute necessities of life during the chaos and killing to their fellow countrymen without regard to religion or political views. Foreign donor countries giving the most support currently include Germany, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Italy and Britain. Others help as well, including money and foodstuffs from Iran and cash from the American Red Cross, the latter channeled through the ICRC so as not to raise Congressional outcries about possible violations of heavy US sanctions being imposed on the Syrian people.</p>
<p>Founded in 1942, as the French colonizers withdrew from this 7000 year old civilization which they occupied in 1917, as part of the English-French Sykes-Picot arrangement, the Syria Arab Red Crescent society became linked with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1946. SARC receives no government funding. This observer had the opportunity to meet SARC staff and volunteers of such singular commitment to helping their countrymen that more than a dozen have given their lives while trying to bring assistance to those stranded in Homs, Aleppo, Idlib, Deraa and elsewhere. One SARC team leader to me: “When one of our people is  killed we bury the martyr  and by the next morning we have 20 or more new volunteers who want to take their place and bring aid to those trapped in the most dangerous areas. I must tell you that this hell we are living through-we are confronting directly—it has made me very proud of my people and to be Syrian. Enshallah, we will overcome this chaos and killing and we will be stronger than before as a people.”</p>
<p>At the United Nations on 11/5/12, a top relief official said the UN aid effort in Syria, which means mainly SARC’s volunteers, “is very dangerous and very difficult.” The official, John Ging, director of operations of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, stated that the aid efforts in Syria (mainly being done by SARC volunteers) was supplying 1.5 million people in with food and that nearly half was being delivered into areas of conflict, but “there are areas beyond our reach, particularly areas under opposition control for quite a long time.”</p>
<p>Despite UNCHR’s role in studying the refugee problem and coordinating yet more studies and some registration of aid applicants during the current crisis, some familiar with its activities in Syria, including a few other NGO’s and some Syrian officials, have been critical of its performance to date. One highly respected governmental official told this observer recently, “I said to UNCHR’s local administration, “We have noticed the many fine vehicles that you flew into Syria, and we have met some of the well paid staff that you have brought to help us, but please can you show us that you have to date delivered even one loaf of bread to our desperate people?”</p>
<p>In fairness to UNCHR, after an admittedly slow start in Syria, it has recently picked up steam and its international staff is learning much from the local Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers.</p>
<p>Nor is SARC is without its critics.</p>
<p>Tawfik Chamaa, spokesman for the Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organizations (UOSSM) speaking from his comfortable Geneva office issued an ad holmium broadside on 11/6/12 against the Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society and its nearly 11,000 volunteers. He charged that cash or materials sent to SARC was being “confiscated by the regime. It will not reach the civilians who are bombed every day or besieged,” telling reporters in Geneva, “Ninety, even 95 percent of everything that is sent to Syrian Red Crescent headquarters in Damascus goes to support the Syrian regime, especially the soldiers.”</p>
<p>However, according to AFP, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN World Food Program (WFP), which both work closely with the Syrian Red Crescent Society, strongly denied their aid was being seized by the government or anyone else. This observer, during the late night of 11/7/12 contacted “Wassim”, a friend and a volunteer at the Damascus SARC HQ who last week arranged visits for me of SARC aid distribution centers and Wassim also flatly denied the UOSSM report.  Wassim informed this observer on the evening of 11/7/12 that SARC will immediately prepare a response to the USOOM allegations.</p>
<p>UOSSM itself  has been criticized,  as have a few other  NGO’s working in Syria, for becoming  politicized, polarized and for being inordinately top heavy administratively with bloated salaries and ” humanitarian team leaders” sitting in  offices in Paris or Geneva and elsewhere far from Syria.  Mr. Chamaa, himself, is a high salaried founding member of the Western group of 14 aid organizations from countries including France, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. According to SARC volunteers working in field aid distribution centers in Syria, Mr Chamaa could learn more were he to visit Syria and actually observe what’s happening on the ground before making unsupported claims. The UOSSM was set up at the beginning of the year mainly by Syrian doctors living in NATO countries.  Some speculate that UOSSM hopes to be part of a possible future NATO affiliated “transition team”  while others claim its political charges against SARC volunteers, without proof, are irresponsible and hurt those suffering most in Syria. The reason is because such alarmist press releases tend to damp down much needed donations of medical aid and necessities. This affects directly the 1.5 million people inside Syria who are in need of emergency humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>In response to Charmaa’s sensationalistic headline grabbing charges, UN World Food Program spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs told the media on 11/7/12: ”I believe there is absolutely no confiscation. WFP food monitors are able to visit most areas to check that food is reaching the people who need it most. Even in some dangerous areas, they use WFP armored vehicles.” She insisted that the Red Crescent, “as the designated coordinator of humanitarian assistance in Syria, operates through branches in an independent manner”.</p>
<p>The ICRC said it was aware of Chamaa’s allegations. Its HQ stated on 11/7/12: “Whenever such facts are clearly established, which does not appear to be the case in Syria, we treat them very seriously and would address directly the management of (the Syrian Red Crescent) and Syrian authorities” ICRC spokeswoman Anastasia Isyuk stressed that the ICRC and the Syrian Red Crescent “strive to assist all populations in need without any discrimination, which is a challenging task given the deteriorating humanitarian situation and security conditions.” The ICRC and SARC volunteers  recently  managed to deliver medical and food aid to 1,200 people in the Old City of Homs, and since the beginning of the year they have provided food, water and other assistance to more than one million people across Syria, according to ICRC spokeswoman Anastasia Isyuk, and as reported by AFP.</p>
<p>On 11/8/12 exhibiting exasperation, a sense of foreboding and just a whiff of defeatism, ICRC president Peter Maurer to a conference in Geneva that “We are in a situation where the humanitarian situation due to the conflict is getting worse. And we can’t cope with the worsening of the situation. We have a lot of blank spots, we know that no aid has been there and I can’t tell you what the situation is or what we can do.”</p>
<p>In a late breaking development Friday morning, 11/9/12, the UN human rights chief expressed concern after the ICRC said it was struggling to deliver aid in war-ravaged Syria. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay told AFP during an interview at the Bali Democracy Forum in Indonesia: “The fact that they’ve now said they are unable to perform their core functions makes the humanitarian crisis in Syria extremely critical. Nearly hopeless.”<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Don’t tell that to Zeinab Tamari, a  thirties something Palestinian volunteer from the Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee Camp in Damascus who is traveling across Syria bringing aid and relief to her fellow Arabs.</p>
<p>And don’t tell either it to Syrian student Mahar Saad whose home was destroyed during fighting in Homs and who daily risks his life remaining in his neighborhood helping his neighbors despite losing family members in the fighting.   Both are SARC volunteers appeared without being asked at one of the aid organizations outlets across Syria to help.  They inspire hope for Syria and for all humanity, regardless of the outcome of the current crisis.</p>
<p>The staff and volunteers who perform the Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society’s humanitarian work undertaken in the main by Syrians for Syrians, with Syrians are a credit to their country and warrant the blessings and support all people of good will as they risk their lives to bring aid to their countrymen.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Romneycartoon3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Romneycartoon2.jpg" align="left" /></a>My cynicism about the stupidity of the American public would have increased exponentially if Mitt Romney would have been elected president.  In over 50 years of voting and 25 years of working professionally in the world of politics and public policy I had never seen such outrageous and persistent lies, distortions and intellectual insults from a presidential candidate.  Please note that I was not an Obama supporter; I proudly voted for the Libertarian candidate.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, Romney sold his soul to first get the Republican nomination and then attempt to win the presidency.  For such a supposedly religious person he had no difficulty in saying anything to win support, despite contradictions with his previous positions and statements as well as with objective facts.  The only thing you could trust about him was his love for his family and religion, and oh yes his quite negative view of 47 percent of the American public muttered when he thought he was only talking to a bunch of his rich supporters.  But for such callous behavior he deserves to go to Mormon hell for lying to so many, including himself apparently because he could justify just about anything because the end of becoming president justified all means.  </p>
<p>Up until the last moment so many of his supporters and the mental midget blowhards on right wing talk radio let their own delusional thinking prevent them from seeing reality.  On FOX News the usual idiots kept predicting landslide state victories for Romney even after all major networks had declared reelection of President Obama, including the FOX network.  Not so surprising when one appreciates the anti-science views of so many conservatives.  Remarkably, the supposed data driven and smart Romney bought into the delusional, self-serving predictions from his supporters in the final days and hours.</p>
<p>“Impossible to beat Santa Claus,” said the poisonous pundit Rush Limbaugh as his explanation of why Romney lost, very much in line with the 47 percent belief of Romney.  Rush only sees lies on the left and none of the multitude of lies that came from the Romney campaign.  And he easily ignores the over 65 demographic taking Medicare and Social Security benefits who mostly voted for Romney.  True conservatives should stop listening to the herd of right wing radio nuts.</p>
<p>Here is my recommendation to President Obama: Offer Mitt Romney the new cabinet position of Secretary of Business.  What a show of innovative bipartisan thinking.  And Romney should gladly accept the offer if he has any core belief whatsoever of serving his country.</p>
<p>The two-party plutocracy remains alive and very well.  Third party presidential candidates once again did miserably.  Most congressional incumbents were reelected, as usual.  The American delusional democracy marches on.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars wasted propagating lies from both sides designed to piss off or frighten people.  Happy to see all those millionaires and billionaires wasting their money on the Romney campaign.  Now, every one of them should donate equal amounts to the recovery efforts related to the Sandy Hurricane disaster.</p>

			<div class="date">
				<p>October 30, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=16076#respond" title="Comment on Five Easy Post-Election Predictions (No Matter Who Wins)"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="16076 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=16076">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/2012-election-US-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/2012-election-US-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>It&#8217;s true that Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have many political differences. But they also agree on many essential policies; enough to make the next four years easily predictable, no matter who wins. Here are five predictions based on the most important shared beliefs of the two candidates: </p>
<p>1) The war on unions will continue. The Republicans are explicitly anti-union, while the Democrats are pro-union in words, but anti-union in practice. Obama&#8217;s much touted Race to the Top national education policy directly targets the heart of the teacher&#8217;s unions — the most powerful union in the country — by attacking seniority rights and restricting wages and benefits.  </p>
<p>Also, Democratic and Republican governors on a state by state basis aim to either carve giant concessions from public employees, or take away their rights as unionists altogether — the lesser evil policy of demanding concessions (Democrats) is but one step from ending collective bargaining (Republicans).  </p>
<p>As the recession grinds on, this bi-partisan anti-union policy will intensify, no matter who is president. The aim of this anti-union policy is to lower wages for all workers, since unions artificially skew the labor market to the benefit of workers in general; attacking the unions is thus an attack on all workers, organized or not, so that corporations can regain &#8220;profitability&#8221; by having their labor costs lowered.  </p>
<p>2) The war on the environment will continue. Both parties treat the environment like they do organized labor. The Republicans openly degrade it and the Democrats make pro-environment statements while practicing the opposite. Whoever wins will continue to pander to Big Coal, and they will continue to advocate for dangerous arctic and Gulf oil drilling, wreak havoc by shale &#8220;natural gas&#8221; drilling, build the cross continental Keystone pipeline, while continuing to do little or nothing to build the absolutely necessary alternative energy infrastructure that would provide jobs and hope for humanity against climate change. Obama and Romney refuse to take the necessary actions to address the climate crisis because doing so would harm the profits of the big corporate polluters. Neither presidential candidates will do so much as begin an honest public discussion about the problem, ensuring that other countries will follow suit, to the peril of all of us.  </p>
<p>3) Wall Street will reign supreme. During the debates it was made clear that no further action against Wall Street was necessary. But the banks are bigger under Obama than they were under Bush, which means they are still &#8220;too big to fail,” ensuring future bailouts paid by taxpayers. Federal Reserve policy is not controversial for either Republicans or Democrats:  historic low interest rates combined with printing massive amounts of additional money — called &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; — have both served the profits of Wall Street banks quite well, while everyone else sees their wages and benefits cut. Loans to working people are no easier to come by, while the banks and corporations are literally sitting on trillions of dollars of reserves in cash.  </p>
<p>4) Post election national austerity cuts. The national deficit is the result of bank bailouts, foreign wars, and decades of continually lowering taxes for the rich and corporations.  Obama and Romney both ignore these facts, and favor &#8220;trigger cuts&#8221; — massive cuts in jobs and social programs that would go into effect if Republicans and Democrats can&#8217;t agree on how many trillions of dollars of cuts to make (Obama&#8217;s proposed deficit cutting plan would make 4 $trillion in cuts; Paul Ryan wants 6 $trillion.)  </p>
<p>And while Obama has made quite a bit of noise about &#8220;taxing the rich&#8221; to help fill the deficit gap, the same promises were made last election and amounted to naught when he extended Bush’s tax cuts for the rich. Taxing the rich is the only alternative to making cuts, since working people have so little left to tax. Instead, Obama is using the deficit to justify massive cuts to Medicare, public education, unemployment insurance, and likely Social Security and other programs. The Obama/Romney &#8220;rift&#8221; over the deficit is, in reality, a polite discussion of how best to slash and burn social programs, while differences are exaggerated for the sake of their election campaigns.  </p>
<p>5) Foreign wars will continue. Listening to Obama and Romney debate foreign war was very much a Pepsi/Coke style debate. Both candidates love Israel, hate Iran and Syria, lie about a &#8220;time table&#8221; for Afghanistan (no serious foreign policy pundit believes the U.S. is leaving Afghanistan in 2014). Both are for continued drone bombings of Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia which are obvious war crimes, while both candidates hypocritically accuse Syria of &#8220;human rights violations.” In short, both candidates argue over how best to push the Middle East and North Africa to the brink of regional war, without being blamed for it. </p>
<p>Ultimately, there do exist differences in social policy between President Obama and Mitt Romney. The above policies, however, will deeply affect all working people in the United States. The country is not in a typical recession. Most economists agree that, at best, the U.S. economy can expect a &#8220;lost decade&#8221; of economic stagnation — at worst, a double dip recession/depression.  </p>
<p>The above policies are shaped with this worst case scenario in mind, with the understanding that for capitalism to re-stabilize itself, a &#8220;new normal&#8221; is needed that shifts the power in the U.S. even more towards the banks and corporations, who must be completely unrestrained by labor, environmental and other regulations to ruthlessly chase profit, to the detriment of us all.  </p>
<p>Thus, the Democrats and Republicans have the same &#8220;big picture&#8221; agenda that all working people should find abhorrent, since corporate gains will come at our expense. Once workers feel compelled to organize themselves to put up a fight, as the Chicago teachers did, all illusions in the Democrats will begin to fade, as people see with their own eyes the Democrats not only refusing to help them but actively opposing them, just as they did to the teachers in Chicago. Developments like this will allow a real movement to emerge that can challenge the two-party corporate dominated agenda. Until labor and community groups can unite on a widespread basis in independent action against the above bi-partisan agenda, we&#8217;ll be forever dragged into rooting for one of two candidates, neither of who have our basic interests in mind.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/terroristbus2.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/terroristbus2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>According to Randall Larsen, Executive Director of the WMD Center in Washington, DC, the terrorists’ next target may be your peanuts.</p>
<p>Yep, Larsen is staying up at night with the worry beads due to the fact that all the nation&#8217;s peanuts are processed at one plant, in North or South Carolina&#8230;he can&#8217;t remember which. According to Larsen, the centralization of this facility provides an easy target for terrorists wielding chemical or biological weapons.</p>
<p>Larsen is a former Colonel in the United States Air Force and is a decorated Vietnam vet.  He is a founding member of the WMD center, a not-for- profit research organization, along with former Senators Bob Graham (D-FL) and Jim Talent (R_MO). Larsen is also the national security advisor at the Center for Biosecurity, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and is a senior fellow at the Homeland Security Policy institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p>In a recent telephone interview, Larsen opined that food terrorism is one the most significant threats faced by the nation.</p>
<p>Larsen also responded to questions about predictions being tendered that we should expect a pandemic by the end of 2013. “Pandemics,” declared Larsen, “run in thirty-forty year cycles. We are overdue.”</p>
<p>In fact, Larsen may have his numbers screwed up. The Spanish flu, which killed 20-40 million people worldwide, made its debut in 1918.  The Asian flu killed about a million people in 1957-58 and only ten years later the Hong Kong flu killed just under a million.</p>
<p>Facts notwithstanding, the predictions persist that 2013 will be the Big One—either in terms of a terrorist attack or a pandemic. Not only have Larsen&#8217;s colleagues, Talent and Graham committed to this perception, but Dr. Daniel Gerstein of the Department of Homeland Security made just such a prediction last December at the Biological Weapons Convention, which took place in Geneva, Switzerland at the United Nations. “We expect a pandemic before the end of 2013,” stated Gerstein.<a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2012/01/dancing-apocalypso-with-microbial.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.activistpost.com/<wbr>2012/01/dancing-apocalypso-</wbr><wbr>with-microbial.html</wbr></a></p>
<p>A pandemic or a biological weapons attack?  Or are they one and the same?</p>
<p>Larsen pooh- poohed the idea that water systems might be a target for a domestic terrorist attack. He stated that, given the amount of pathogen necessary to contaminate a water system, it was highly unlikely that such an effort would be successful.</p>
<p>However, Larsen&#8217;s perception is not shared by others in government nor by the scientific community.  Last year, DHS chief Janet Napolitano issued a homeland security warning <a href="http://www.news10.net/news/article/146508/2/Homeland-Security-warns-of-insider-threat-to-utilities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.news10.net/news/<wbr>article/146508/2/Homeland-</wbr><wbr>Security-warns-of-insider-</wbr><wbr>threat-to-utilities</wbr></a> that dangerous terrorists had infiltrated  utility companies and that the threat to an attack through infrastructure was emergent.</p>
<p>Her concerns were echoed just last week by Leon Panetta, who was reported  in Money News<a href="http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/us-panetta-cyber-attack/2012/10/12/id/459732?s=al&amp;promo_code=105C0-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.moneynews.com/<wbr>StreetTalk/us-panetta-cyber-</wbr><wbr>attack/2012/10/12/id/459732?s=</wbr><wbr>al&amp;promo_code=105C0-1</wbr></a>) as declaring that attackers “are targeting the computer control systems that operate chemical, electricity and water plants, and those that guide transportation throughout the country,” He went on to say that an aggressor nation or terrorist group could “could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.”</p>
<p>The scientific community is also at odds with Larsen’s assessment of the threat posed by a waterborne attack. A heavily footnoted report by the Congressional Research Service entitled “Terrorism and Security Issues Facing the Water Infrastructure Sector,” declared “Bioterrorism or chemical attacks could deliver widespread contamination with small amounts of microbiological agents or toxic chemicals, and could endanger the public health of thousands.” (December 15, 2010)</p>
<p>During the course of our phone interview, this reporter suggested to Larsen that the danger posed by vulnerabilities inherent in the very configuration of water systems countrywide might present a compelling concern to those involved in protecting the United States from a terrorist attack. With his permission, this reporter forwarded a report detailing these vulnerabilities, which was submitted to the Critical Infrastructure unit of the Department of Homeland Security last August. The report is reproduced in its entirety, below.</p>

<td><strong>Ray,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I appreciate so much your speaking to me today at the Critical Infrastructure Command Center and taking my verbal report on my concerns as to critical vulnerabilities in the U.S. water systems, as currently configured. It is my understanding that work began sometime in the 1970&#8242;s and that double lines were installed in cities across America. This has resulted in a critical vulnerability to insider attack   through the water system. As you requested, I am sending you this email with links to articles on this subject.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As I stated in our call, which took place at approximately 5:45 pm ET on August 5, 2011, DHS Chief Janet Napolitano&#8217;s concerns that terrorists may have infiltrated utility companies and may intend to launch an attack through water or other utilities may be well founded. In the articles below, you will see where I have interviewed a number of people working in pivotal positions in water systems and have found their responses to be specious and inaccurate. The false and misleading statements made by those named herein clearly attempt to redirect concern away from the very aspects of the water systems which provide the vulnerability to attack&#8211;double lines and remote controlled valves, which are currently withholding what can potentially be released into the targeted households.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are the links to a number of articles I have authored concerning the possibility of bioterrorism in general and the potential use of the water system as a means of attacking selected portions of the U.S. populace. Some of these articles were published in hard copy newspapers and some were published on the web.  I cannot stress enough the selectivity provided by the system as currently configured.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I will look forward to hearing back from you shortly. I am currently out of the country and you may leave a message for me at <a href="tel:541%20603-0514" target="_blank">541 603-0514</a> or you may reach me by email.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>

<p>Larsen&#8217;s response was terse and to the point. On September 8, 2012, he sent me this message from his I phone:</p>
<p><strong>“After reading some of your pieces on the Internet about the Patriot Act, I assure you we will have no further conversations or email exchanges. Sorry I wasted your time and mine.”</strong></p>
<p>Well, at least he has locked in on the Skippy terrorism. What a relief. I was beginning to think we might have a problem</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rip-amerika2.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rip-amerika2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>During the second half of the 20th century the United States was an opportunity society. The ladders of upward mobility were plentiful, and the middle class expanded. Incomes rose, and ordinary people were able to achieve old-age security.</p>
<p>In the 21st century the opportunity society has disappeared. Middle class jobs are scarce. Indeed, jobs of any kind are scarce. To stay even with population growth from 2002 through 2011, the economy needed about 14 million new jobs. However, at the end of 2011 there were only 1 million more jobs than in 2002. <a title="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm " href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm" target="_blank">http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm </a></p>
<p>Only 426,000 of these jobs are in the private sector. The bulk of the net new jobs consist of waitresses and bartenders and health care and social assistance. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over the 9 years, employment for waitresses and bartenders increased by 1,188,000. Employment in health care and social assistance increased 3,087,000. These two categories accounted for 1,000% of the net private sector job growth.</p>
<p>As for manufacturing jobs, they not only did not grow with the population but declined absolutely. During these nine years, 3.5 million middle class manufacturing jobs were lost.</p>
<p>Over the entire nine years, only 48,000 new jobs were created for architects and engineers.</p>
<p>In the 21st century the US economy has been able to create only a few new jobs and these are in lowly paid domestic services that cannot be offshored, such as waitresses and bartenders.</p>
<p>The lack of jobs, especially high value-added, high productivity jobs, is the reason real median household income has declined and the distribution of income has worsened. Without rising real household income, there cannot be a consumer economy.</p>
<p>In the early years of the 21st century, the Federal Reserve substituted a rise in consumer debt to drive the economy in place of the missing rise in consumer incomes. Low interest rates drove up housing prices, and people refinanced their mortgages and spent the equity. The Federal Reserve kept the economy alive by loading up consumers with debt that housing prices and consumer incomes would soon be unable to support.</p>
<p>When debt and real estate prices reached unsustainable levels, the bubble popped, and the ongoing financial crisis was upon us.</p>
<p>The cause of all of the problems is the offshoring of Americans’ jobs. When jobs are moved offshore, consumers’ careers and incomes, and the GDP and payroll and income tax base associated with those jobs, go with them. When the goods and services produced for American markets by offshored labor are brought into the US to be sold, the trade deficit rises, and downward pressure is put on the dollar, pushing up domestic inflation. (On October 12, statistician John Williams (<a title="shadowstats.com" href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/shadowstats.com" target="_blank">shadowstats.com</a>) reported that “third-quarter wholesale inflation jumped to an annualized 6.2%.”)</p>
<p>Jobs offshoring is driven by Wall Street, “shareholder advocates,” the threat of takeovers, and by large retailers, such as Walmart. By cutting labor costs, profits go up.It is that simple. However, as a result of sending American jobs to cheap labor countries, US consumer incomes go down. The end result is to destroy the domestic consumer market. What would have been US consumer income growth becomes instead profit growth for US corporations.</p>
<p>Keynesian economists use in their textbooks the example of how the aggregate effect of individual saving could be the opposite of the effect intended by the individuals. Whereas each saver seeks to improve his position by building wealth, in the aggregate saving could exceed investment, resulting in a decline in aggregate demand and a fall in income for all. Offshoring has the same logic. Each corporation can expect to gain more profits from moving US jobs offshore, but the aggregate effect is a fall in American consumer incomes and a reduction in the American consumer market.</p>
<p>I have told this story many times. But policymakers, the media, and economists seem unable to connect the dots.</p>
<p>Jobs offshoring has substantial implications for Social Security and Medicare. The US has the least adequate social safety net of any developed country. The two major components of the US social safety net are Social Security and Medicare for the elderly. Social Security and Medicare are financed by a payroll tax. The combined tax is 15.3% of payrolls. For the past quarter of a century the Social Security portion of the payroll tax has built up a surplus of over $2 trillion. Recently, the Medicare portion began running in the red.</p>
<p>Right-wing Republicans, free market ideologues, and the left-wing have all indoctrinated themselves with incorrect beliefs about Social Security and Medicare. The right-wing claims that a safety net financed with 15.3% of payrolls is a “Ponzi scheme” and an “unfunded liability.” If that is the case, then so are veterans benefits, military pensions, and federal pensions, all of which are financed by the income tax, the basis for the payroll tax.</p>
<p>The left-wing claims that the rich do not pay high enough payroll taxes, because the income subject to Social Security payroll tax is capped at about $110,000. But the benefits are also capped. Social Security is not supposed to be an income redistribution scheme from rich to poor, and it is not supposed to be a pension system for the rich. The pension paid is supposed to correlate with the pre-retirement income level of the retiree. Those who had higher wages or salaries and consequently paid more in payroll taxes receive a larger Social Security check than those who had lower wages and salaries and paid less payroll taxes, although there is favoritism toward the lower income earners who receive proportionally more in respect to their payroll taxes than higher income earners.</p>
<p>There is no cap on income subject to the Medicare portion of the payroll tax. Moreover, Medicare charges a Medicare Part B premium that is deducted from the Social Security monthly check. In addition, there is a further Part B premium based on retirement age income. For example, someone working beyond retirement age and making $250,000 per year pays about $3,800 in Medicare Part B premium in addition to the Medicare portion of the payroll tax of about $7,500. The annual premium he pays for his “free” Medicare for which he has paid all his working life with a payroll tax is about $11,300.</p>
<p>Moreover, Medicare by itself is insufficient coverage. To actually have medical coverage, those covered by Medicare have to purchase a supplementary private policy to cover the large gaps in Medicare. Depending on the range of coverage, a supplementary policy costs approximately $100 to $300 per month.</p>
<p>As the person making $250,000 per year is likely to go for the most coverage, he will be paying about $14,900 (excluding deductions and co-payments) per year for his “free” Medicare. This is despite having paid the Medicare payroll tax each year of his working life. A person who made $250,000 in taxable income per year for 30 years would have paid $217,500 into Medicare at the current Medicare payroll tax rate.</p>
<p>The right-wing’s notion that Social Security and Medicare are handouts, part of the welfare state’s bread and circuses, and the left-wing’s idea that the rich get a free ride are equally untrue.</p>
<p>(Note: $250,000 is the politicians’ dividing line between the rich and the rest of us. For a person making $50,000 a year, an income five times larger can seem rich. However, a $250,000 annual income leaves a family or person far distant from the lifestyle of the rich. Upper middle class incomes are generally associated with high-tax, high-cost urban areas in states with high income taxes. After federal income and payroll taxes, state income and sales taxes, and property taxes, what appears to many as a large income disappears. In New York City, the federal income tax will take about 25% of the $250,000, New York state will take about 9%, and New York City will take about 3.65%. The combined city and state sales tax is 8.875%. The property tax is high. The conclusion is that in New York City a $250,000 income is reduced to $125,000 or thereabouts. Those who claim “the rich don’t pay taxes” are not talking about $250,000 incomes.)</p>
<p>Social Security and Medicare have served the country well. They protect the individual from his own mistakes, from crooked and incompetent money managers, and from financial crises, and they protect society from the moral dilemma of confronting large numbers of fellow citizens who through fault or no fault of their own cannot provide for their livelihood and medical care. After the financial scandals and crisis of the past five years, it is a stretch to believe that any but the astute can manage their personal wealth, whether small or large, in today’s situation of unregulated financial markets, zero interest rates, currency uncertainty, and highly complex investment instruments with computers programmed with mathematical models dominating equity trades.</p>
<p>The argument that conceptually a person could do better by investing his payroll taxes in the stock market is a poor basis for old age security policy. The person can do better as long as he or she doesn’t fall into the hands of a Bernie Madoff or a Goldman Sachs, doesn’t receive zero interest on his bonds because the Federal Reserve has to bail out the “too big to fail banks,” doesn’t experience a decline in currency value due to monetization of enormous federal deficits, and doesn’t experience a bear market as he approaches retirement.</p>
<p>The right-wing ideologues who try to scare old age security out of existence go on and on about rising medical costs, about an aging population living longer, declining birthrates and a worsening ratio of workers to retirees, about people learning to rely on handouts rather than their own means, and about Washington’s rising unfunded liabilities.</p>
<p>Scare projections are designed to scare, and most are untenable. For example, longevity was a product of rising incomes, good diet, and antibiotics. Today only the upper crust have rising incomes. Antibiotics are wearing out from abuse and rising immunity of bacteria. Diet is compromised in ways still poorly understood as a result of GMOs, pesticides, herbicides, pumping chicken, pork, and beef full of antibiotics and hormones and feeding the animals GMO grains and also possibly infected animal byproducts, and pumping our water full of fluoride. A variety of destructive activities and behaviors are causing ecological damage. Longevity might have been a short-term benefit of irreproducible conditions considering the mounting ecological damage and the rise of superbugs, stress, and tainted food and water production.</p>
<p>The projection of an aging population might also be wrong. Clearly, the post-World War II baby boomers are aging, but do the projections take into account the legislated 1965 immigration increases plus the illegal influx from Mexico and points south of young people with high birth rates? How can it be that a country with allegedly 30 million illegal immigrants, whose children born in the US are citizens, has a declining birth rate? How do we know that the illegal population will not continue to increase?</p>
<p>There are so many Spanish speaking people in the US today that if a person calls any of his utility companies, whether telephone, Internet, water, electricity, TV, or any of his credit card companies, or his bank, he has to select English or Spanish. Obviously, as<br />
anti-immigration sites make clear, the US population is changing in its national origin, and there appears to be no sign of an aging Hispanic population. How many old Spanish speaking people do you see in the US compared to the young?</p>
<p>When confronted with this apparent fact, the response is: “why will the Hispanics pay for the aging white population?” The answer is: because they are in the same payroll tax system and the taxes will be withheld from their wages and salaries just as they are from everyone else’s.</p>
<p>It is possible that if Hispanics in the US have suffered years of hostility, accusations, and hatred from “the ice people,” once Hispanics are sufficiently numerous to control the legislature, assuming one still exists, or to take over the executive branch, the only seat of power, they may in retribution cut off the aging whites. But if so, the whites will have brought it on themselves.</p>
<p>Whatever the scare projections that are mustered to undermine the public provision of old age security, the real financial danger is never mentioned. The only significant financial danger to Social Security and Medicare is the offshoring of American jobs and GDP. A country without a job base is without a payroll tax base. If the only jobs that the 21st century “world’s only superpower” economy can create are for waitresses, bartenders, and health care and social assistance (hospital orderlies and practical nurses), payroll tax revenues will be less than if the US still had 20 million workers and rising in well-paid manufacturing jobs instead of 11 million.</p>
<p>Regardless of Medicare’s financing, the death knell for the elderly was the legality of abortion. If the yet to be born are an insufferable burden, imagine the cost of the elderly. As far as the state is concerned, once you stop producing income and payroll tax revenues for the state, it is time for you to die. Washington would rather enact euthanasia than to pay back the $2+ trillion in the Social Security trust fund that Washington spent, leaving only non-marketable IOUs in the account.</p>
<p>Readers might think that Americans would never stand for death by injection for the elderly once the qualified age is reached. But why would they not? They have accepted millions of aborted babies, and Americans, including the elderly, have stood for Washington’s murder, maiming and displacement of millions of Muslim men, women, and children in 7 countries over the past 11 years and are yet to show any signs of remorse for their complicity in mass murder. Next month tens of millions of Americans will vote for Mitt Romney who believes Obama isn’t killing Muslims fast enough.</p>
<p>The new “Obamneycare” health legislation does have “death panels.” They are not called that, and they do not make formal decisions to terminate lives. But it comes to almost the same thing. Various panels, committees, or bureaucratic departments are empowered to make decisions about “effective care.” It has long been known that most health care costs are associated with the last year of life. Cost and age will be elements in determining standards of care. The greater the weight assigned to cost, the more care will be withheld. In effect, the “effective care” panel is a “death panel.”</p>
<p>Prior to the advent of the new “health care” system, Medicare and or hospitals are already shifting costs to Medicare patients. To avoid penalties and fraud allegations for “medically unnecessary hospitalizations,” rather than formally admit Medicare patients as inpatients, hospital administrators classify them as outpatients “under observation.”<br />
According to a Brown University analysis of Medicare records in 2007, 2008, and 2009, the ratio of Medicare observation patients to those admitted as inpatients rose by 34 percent.</p>
<p>Being classified an outpatient under observation eliminates medicare coverages, especially for post-operative or post-accident rehabilitation care, leaving Medicare patients with bills in the tens of thousands of dollars (AARP Bulletin, October 2012).</p>
<p>Other costs are being shifted to doctors and to hospitals. Medicare pays fixed prices for each covered procedure or test, and these prices can be as low as half of the billed prices. During a period when costs incurred by providers of health care have been rising, Medicare has been cutting the amounts it pays providers.</p>
<p>As the payroll tax is commingled with general tax revenues, Social Security and Medicare payroll tax collections can be diverted to other purposes and, thus, are always subject to competing budgetary demands, such as the previous 11 years of gratuitous wars and the bailouts of “banks too big to fail,” or to deficit reduction demands as the government consistently overspends all revenue sources.</p>
<p>A national health service is the only way to control health costs and provide the population with health care coverage. A national health system takes the many levels of profits out of the system and also reams of compliance and liability costs. A national health system can coexist with a private system for those who can afford it or whose employers are sufficiently profitable to provide it.</p>
<p>As Jarad Diamond reveals in his book, <a title="Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed" href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=paulcraigrobe-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=0143117009" target="_blank">Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed</a>, societies fail, if not because of their moral bankruptcy, then because their rulers are only capable of short-term thinking. The future is beyond their interest. The US offshored its economy, because it worked short-term for corporate executives (rewarded with multi-million dollar performance bonuses), Wall Street (rewarded with profits), shareholders (rewarded with capital gains), and politicians (rewarded with corporate and Wall Street campaign contributions).</p>
<p>Incompetent free market economists confused jobs offshoring with free trade. They said the country would and was benefiting by giving its manufacturing, industrial, and tradable professional service jobs to China and India, that the US was ridding itself of “dirty fingernail jobs” and would soon be flush with highly paid high-tech jobs and highly paid financial service jobs.</p>
<p>None of these promises or predictions were true. Nowhere in the government’s jobs statistics are there any of these promised replacement jobs. The economists who provided cover for the destruction of the US economy were rewarded by the corporations with speaking fees, grants for their university departments, and newspaper columns paid for by corporate advertisers. Those few who told the truth were expelled from the corporate media that Bill and Hilary Clinton allowed to be monopolized (for campaign contributions, of course).</p>
<p>The future of old age security in the United States has been lost, because the job base has been given away to foreigners in order to maximize incomes in the short-run for the few decision-makers.</p>
<p>The misrepresentation of jobs offshoring as free trade has destroyed the prospects of cities, counties, and states along with those of unions and millions of Americans who once had a secure future. It has destroyed the prospects of class after class of university graduates burdened with student loans who expected to step into the jobs that have been offshored or filled by H-1B visa holders from abroad.</p>
<p>The American work force has been forsaken by the corporations and by Washington, and this means that Social Security and Medicare have also been forsaken.</p>
<p>As I predicted in the early years of this new century, “the United States will be a third world country in 20 years.” We might get there even sooner as Washington exhausts what little is left of American wealth in gratuitous wars in service to Israel and the US Military/Security Complex, in unaffordable military buildups in futile hopes of establishing hegemony over China and Russia, and in negative interest rates from the Federal Reserve’s effort to drive up the book value of debt instruments on the balance sheets of financial institutions.</p>
<p>In 1817 Percy Bysshe Shelly forecast America’s future:</p>
<p>“I met a traveler from an antique land<br />
Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,<br />
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command,<br />
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read,<br />
Which yet survive, stampt on these lifeless things,<br />
The hand that mockt them and the heart that fed:<br />
On the pedestal these words appear:<br />
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br />
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’<br />
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br />
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>
<p>Writing in the October 15 online CounterPunch, John V. Walsh, relying on charts prepared by economics professor Mark J. Perry at the University of Michigan and blogger John Hunter, concludes that it is a myth that US manufacturing is in decline.</p>
<p>Walsh says that the loss of US manufacturing jobs is due to automation, not to offshoring. Think about this for a moment. Perry’s graph on which Walsh relies shows the sharp drop in US manufacturing employment to be a 21st century experience. However, automation has been around for a long time. The notion that its effect on employment only showed up recently needs an explanation that is not provided. The steep drop in US manufacturing employment that began in 2000 does correspond with the date at which jobs offshoring began to bite hard.</p>
<p>Why does automation not also affect Chinese manufacturing, especially as most of the Chinese manufacturing technology came from the US as US corporations offshored their production for the US market? If Chinese manufacturing is not up to date with automation, like the US is assumed to be, how do the Chinese, even with cheap labor, undersell US automated factories? How did Chinese manufacturing employment increase in a mere four years by an amount equal to the total manufacturing employment in the US?</p>
<p>The US Bureau of Economic Analysis shows only 11.2 million full time US manufacturing jobs in 2010. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows 11.7 million US manufacturing jobs in 2011, down from 15.3 million in 2002.</p>
<p>In contrast, China, an industrial and manufacturing backwater for most of my life, had 112 million manufacturing jobs in 2006. In a mere four years (2002-2006), the increase in China’s manufacturing employment was as large as today’s total employment in US manufacturing. As long ago as 2006, China’s manufacturing employment was about 10 times the current US manufacturing employment. The Chinese population is about 4 times larger than the US population, but China’s manufacturing population is proportionately greater&#8211;10 times larger. Indeed, Chinese manufacturing employees almost equal the total number of employees in all occupations in the US (Manufacturing and Technology News, December 15, 2009).</p>
<p>Obviously, something is wrong with Walsh’s article or the graphs on which he relied.</p>
<p>America’s manufacturing prowess cannot be found in the statistical data. The US is primarily an exporter of Agricultural commodities. The US imports almost twice the amount of manufactured goods as it exports. Indeed, according to the US Census Bureau Statistical Abstract of the US <a title="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1308.pdf" href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1308.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1308.pdf</a> US imports of manufactured goods are 5.5 times larger than US imports of crude oil and 4 times larger than all imports of mineral fuel. Yet, we hear about energy dependency, not manufacturing dependency.</p>
<p>As of 2010 the “superpower” US economy still had a trade surplus in airplanes and airplane parts and a small $6 billion surplus in scientific instruments, but that is about all.</p>
<p>In ADP equipment and office machinery, the US exported $22.2 billion in 2010 (latest information at time of writing), down from $44.6 billion in 2000. US imports in 2010 of ADP equipment and office machinery were $113.5 billion, or 5.1 times exports.</p>
<p>The US cannot even make its own clothes and shoes. In 2010 footwear imports are 28.7 times exports. Clothing imports are 24.6 times exports.</p>
<p>Electrical machinery exports were $77 billion; imports were $120 billion.</p>
<p>Exports of power generating machinery were $33 billion; imports were $42 billion.</p>
<p>Exports of television, VCRs were $21.5 billion; imports were $137 billion.</p>
<p>US exports of vehicles was $88 billion; imports were $179 billion.</p>
<p>US news reports of thousands upon thousands of discharged US workers never cite their replacement by automation. The news story is always that the plant is being closed and the jobs moved abroad. Any review of America’s former manufacturing centers verifies this. Boarded up plants and cities and towns in decline are the remains of America’s formerly world dominant manufacturing economy.</p>
<p>The loss of the US post-war trade surplus in manufacturing has left the US with a huge trade deficit. The charts on which Walsh relied left him unaware of the fact that China has a large trade surplus with the US, and the US has a large trade deficit not only with China but with the world.</p>
<p>The fact that the US has to import not only manufactured goods, but also high-technology products from China, an inconceivable outcome during the second half of the 20th century, is powerful testimony to the decline of the US as a manufacturing powerhouse.</p>
<p>It took some doing to obscure the facts and to present the US as a rival to China in manufacturing prowess. How did it happen?</p>
<p>The fault might lie in the way statistical information is collected and presented. Apple, for example, is a US corporation. It reports its worldwide earnings to the IRS. Its manufacturing is counted as US manufacturing as it is a US corporation. However, Apple doesn’t produce a single computer in the US. They are produced in China. The employment that Apple reports is in China. The Chinese are employed by an American company, but they are not Americans. The Chinese incomes that Apple provides do not support the American consumer market or provide the tax base for cities and states. The Chinese incomes do not provide ladders of upward mobility or careers for Americans.</p>
<p>The wages Apple pays are in China. The consumer incomes and GDP that it generates are in China. When Apple’s computers come back to America to be sold they come in as imports. But Apple’s manufacturing and employment are reported as the output and employment of an American company.</p>
<p>When statistics and the methods by which they are compiled were put into effect, countries did not offshore their production for their domestic markets. Foreign investments were made for selling abroad, not for selling in the home market. With the advent of offshoring, counting the employment and output of US firms that are producing abroad for their domestic market as an indication of the strength of US manufacturing is very misleading. Apple, for example, has done more to boost China’s GDP than to boost America’s GDP. This is true of every US corporation that offshores its production for US consumers.</p>
<p>In recent years the percentage of the work forces of large US corporations that is foreign sourced has risen rapidly. Some of the overseas hiring reflects traditional foreign investment in which a company builds abroad in order to sell abroad, but much of the hiring reflects offshored production for US markets.</p>
<p>The US has been able to survive the large trade deficits produced by jobs offshoring, because the US dollar is the world reserve currency. Being the world reserve currency, the US does not have to earn foreign currencies with exports in order to pay for its imports. However, as these trade deficits persist and the buildup of foreign holdings of dollar paper assets rises, there is a diminishing willingness of foreigners to trade real goods and services for financial assets denominated in a fiat currency whose value is diminishing with the ever-growing supply.</p>
<p>Thus, the basic notion of globalism&#8211;that a country’s corporations can produce goods and services in any country for home markets&#8211;is false.</p>
<p>Walsh is correct that China is not to blame for the decline in US manufacturing. Offshoring is to blame, and, thus, the blame lies with US corporations, policymakers, and the economists and financial media who shill for “globalism.” The decision was made to sacrifice the US economy to the short-term profits of the few. A country so poorly led can do nothing but decline.</p>

<p>Before one can understand the nature of partisan or party politics, a correct comprehension of <a href="http://batr.org/verity/id7.html">The Choice of Ideology</a> is essential.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Contemporary Political Ideologies is a text book that has been around for a long time. Many of the usual suspects are covered: Capitalism, Socialism, Democracy, Conservatism, Liberalism, Nationalism, Marxism, Fascism, Anarchism, Libertarianism, Feminism and Environmentalism. Since written, additional offshoots have come to include: Neoconservatism, the Paleo versions of Conservatism and Libertarianism and what we will call &#8220;Inherit Populism&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>These broad based viewpoints have distinctions, sometimes subtle, often dramatic. The reason why partisan politics is a blood sport is that it is waged to achieve a false party line. <a href="http://batr.org/">BREAKING ALL THE RULES</a> advocates a paleo-conservative philosophy based upon traditional values and moral principles. Consistent with the historic legacy of the founding of this Nation is a lament that most inhabitants are oblivious to our ingenious heritage and purpose of the <a href="http://batr.org/solitary/090503.html">American Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>The article, <a href="http://batr.org/view_/072401.html">Ideology Matters, But What Is It?</a>, clearly repudiates the destructive ideologies that result in the suicidal course this country has taken, especially in the last century.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The test for valid support is simple. The legacy of the New Deal to the Good Society has constructed a total reputation of American ideals. To deny this reality, is to associate yourself with the cause of depravity. There is no room to compromise on this axiom. The lines are clear, distinct and irrefutable. Career operatives rationalize their support for destructive policies as the price for civility. The notion that getting along with the opposition that is bent upon the destruction of the Nation is psychotic. When polls are cited that the public wants less ranker, leadership sinks into the cauldron of deceit and treachery of our heritage. Those of us who advocate a State responsive and accountable to the citizen, are left with few champions to carry the banner of limited government.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rejecting an artificial left/right template for a deeper analysis of the publically accepted nomenclature of liberal vs. conservative is a constructive leap to appreciate the differences that are so prevalent among different factions within society.</p>
<p>How individuals assess politics often rests upon their own personality and outlook. From a report in <a href="http://www.psychotherapynetworker.org/magazine/currentissue/item/1744-clinicians-digest?tmpl=component&amp;print=1">Clinician&#8217;s Digest</a>, the following insights are useful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Personality differences are a leading candidate in the race toward understanding the rift between political liberals and conservatives. Using data compiled from nearly 20,000 respondents, Columbia University researcher Dana Carney and colleagues found that two common personality traits reliably differentiated individuals with liberal or conservative identifications. Liberals reported greater openness, whereas conservatives reported higher conscientiousness. This means that liberals (at least in their own estimation) saw themselves as more creative, flexible, tolerant of ambiguity, and open to new ideas and experiences. Across the political personality divide, conservatives self-identified as more persistent, orderly, moralistic, and methodical.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that these personality differences between liberals and conservatives begin to emerge at an early age. A 20-year longitudinal study by Jack and Jeanne Block showed that those who grew up to be liberals were originally assessed by their preschool teachers as more emotionally expressive, gregarious, and impulsive when compared to those who became conservatives, who were considered more inhibited, uncertain, and controlled. Liberals may show greater tolerance for diversity and creativity, but they may also be more impulsive, indecisive, and irresponsible. On the flip side, conservatives may be organized, stable, and thrifty, but also have stronger just-world beliefs (leading to a greater tolerance for inequality), and stronger fears of mortality and ambiguity. Even recent neuroscience work published in Current Biology from University College London identifies fundamental differences in the partisan brain. Brain scans revealed a larger amygdala in self-identified conservatives and a larger anterior cingulate cortex in liberals, leading the researchers to conclude that conservatives may be more acute at detecting threats around them, whereas liberals may be more adept at handling conflicting information and uncertainty.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Partisan party proponents, both Democrats and Republicans are practicing Statists. Mutual lust to control the levers of government closes ranks, when an external threat comes from dissenting citizens. This background brings us to examine the essay, <a href="http://gibiru.com/index.php/uncensored-news/78-news/21183-the-case-of-brandon-raub-speaking-out-against-government-is-a-mental-disorder">Speaking Out Against Government is a Mental Disorder</a>, by Susanne Posel.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to the psychiatric manual, the DSM-IV-TR, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/39441533/3-Pages-of-the-eBook-of-Diagnostic-and-Statistical-Manual-of-Mental-Disorders-DSM-IV-TR-Fourth-Edition">oppositional defiant disorder</a> (ODD) is a mental disease wherein free thinkers, non-conformists, civil disobedience supporters, those who question authority and are perceived as being hostile toward the government are labeled mentally ill. Psychiatrists refer to this mental defect as &#8220;Mentality III&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This mental disorder is defined as: &#8220;a recurrent pattern of negativistic, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority figures that persists for at least 6 months.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms Posel continues:</p>
<p align="center">Symptoms of ODD include:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>negativistic and defiant behaviors are expressed by persistent stubbornness</li>
<li>resistance to directions</li>
<li>unwillingness to compromise, give in, or negotiate with adults or peers</li>
<li>defiance may also include deliberate or persistent testing of limits, usually by ignoring orders, arguing, and failing to accept blame for misdeeds</li>
<li>hostility can be directed at adults or peers and is shown by deliberately annoying others or by verbal aggression (usually without the more serious physical aggression seen in Conduct Disorder)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If this alleged ailment has, any legitimate clinical application, it seems that these warning signs, foremost apply to elected officials and party organizations. Reinforcing the practice of the partisan political psychopathic art, <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-personality-analyst/200902/partisan-politics">John D. Mayer</a> in Psychology Today asks two questions. The first is relevant while the second is naive.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If members of Congress and the executive branch extended genuine respect to one another, wouldn&#8217;t they recognize that it is more important to vote for that which is best for the country rather than for that which may promote their political party? If they truly respected one another, wouldn&#8217;t the best and brightest among them join in a thoughtful give-and-take to promote good legislation above partisanship?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Where is the evidence that government has the objective of &#8220;doing what is best for the country&#8221;? Frankly, the body of facts is so overwhelming that every successive administration builds upon the treason of the last government, that only a faint memory of a constitutional Republic exists. The notion that power hungry grabbers are capable of transcending partisan rhetoric for a good purpose is patently absurd. The only cooperation that ever unites the party politics is to protect the despotism of the State.</p>
<p>Daniel J. Flynn writes about Jonathan Haidt’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Righteous-Mind-Politics-Religion/dp/0307377903">The Righteous Mind</a> in <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-psychology-of-partisanship/">The Psychology of Partisanship</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Haidt helped devise a questionnaire that gauged moral views by eliciting test-taker responses to statements in five categories: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. Haidt likens these moral groupings to the five taste receptors of the tongue (sweet, sour, bitter, savory, salty). It turns out that liberal receptors failed to engage on questions of loyalty, authority, and sanctity. Conservatives, on the other hand, reacted to all five moral categories more or less equally. Haidt’s conclusion is that his fellow liberals are morally tone deaf. &#8220;Republicans understand moral psychology,&#8221; Haidt concedes. &#8220;Democrats don’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>It gets worse for liberals. Haidt and colleagues asked their subjects to answer their questionnaire as if they were liberals, as if they were conservatives, and as themselves. Liberals don’t know their political adversaries nearly as well as the right knows them. &#8220;The results were clear and consistent. Moderates and conservatives were most accurate in their predictions, whether they were pretending to be liberals or conservatives. Liberals were the least accurate, especially those who described themselves as ‘very liberal.’ The biggest errors in the whole study came when liberals answered the Care and Fairness questions while pretending to be conservatives.&#8221; Liberals see caricatures when they see conservatives.</p>
<p>The thesis may prove cathartic for Republican readers. But it’s more useful to Democrats.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As long as partisan political parties, ignore moral principles, and the &#8220;<em>States Rights</em>&#8221; framework of limited government the psychological disorders of the ultimate Statist mental illness will spread. It is always amusing when partisan critics rant about the lack of condemnation against opposing party foes, when their silence about the abuses of their patron party hacks goes unspoken.</p>
<p>It is bad enough how ignorant the average voter is when they cast their ballot. As long as people accept and tolerate the two party diatribes against viewpoints that challenge the establishment power cabal, there are no viable prospects for elective solutions. As of this writing, the <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/obama_administration/daily_presidential_tracking_poll">Rasmussen Reports</a> daily Presidential Tracking Poll has, &#8220;Mitt Romney attracting support from 48% of voters nationwide, while President Obama earns the vote from 47%. One percent (1%) prefers some other candidate, and four percent (4%) are undecided.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can any thinking and responsible American vote for either candidate? Both are tyrannical teammates for the globalist franchise. Those who speak out against the establishment order are not the ones with a mental illness. Those who vote for their own demise are one-step removed from the infective treachery coming out of the federal government. Paleo-conservative ideology is the righteous political philosophy for a Free People. What is the state of your own mental health?</p>

The truth is that our financial system is even more vulnerable than it was back in 2008, and financial experts such as Doug Short, Peter Schiff, Robert Wiedemer and Harry Dent are all warning that the next crash is rapidly approaching.  We are living in the greatest debt bubble in the history of the world and Wall Street has been transformed into a giant casino that is based on a massive web of debt, risk and leverage.  When that web breaks we are going to see a stock market crash that is going to make 2008 look like a Sunday picnic.  Yes, the Federal Reserve has tried to prevent any problems from erupting in the financial markets by initiating<a title="another round of quantitative easing" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/qe4-the-big-wall-street-banks-are-already-complaining-that-qe3-is-not-enough">another round of quantitative easing</a>, but 40 billion dollars a month will not be nearly enough to stop the massive collapse that is coming.  This will be explained in detail toward the end of the article.  Hopefully we will get through October (and the rest of this year) without seeing a stock market collapse, but without a doubt one is coming at some point.  Those on the wrong end of the coming crash are going to be absolutely wiped out.</p>
<p>A lot of people focus on the month of October because of the history of stock market crashes in this month.  This history was detailed in a recent <a title="USA Today article" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2012/10/02/october-stock-market-crash-proof/1601355/" target="_blank">USA Today article</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When it comes to wealth suddenly disappearing, October can be diabolically frightful. The stock market crash of 1929 that led to the Great Depression occurred in October. So did the 22.6% plunge suffered by the Dow Jones industrial average in 1987 on &#8220;Black Monday.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>The scariest 19-day span during the 2008 financial crisis also went down in October, when the Dow plunged 2,675 points after investors fearing a financial collapse went on a panic-driven stock-selling spree that resulted in five of the 10 biggest daily point drops in the iconic Dow&#8217;s 123-year history.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So what will we see this year?</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
<p>If a stock market crash does not happen this month or by the end of this year, that does not mean that the experts that are predicting a stock market crash are wrong.</p>
<p>It just means that they were early.</p>
<p>As I have said so many times, there are thousands upon thousands of moving parts in the global financial system.  So that makes it nearly impossible to predict the timing of events with perfect precision.  Financial conditions are constantly shifting and changing.</p>
<p>But without a doubt another major financial collapse similar to what happened back in 2008 (or even worse) is on the way.  Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the financial experts that are predicting really bad things for our financial markets in the months ahead&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Doug Short</strong></p>
<p>According to Doug Short, the vice president of research at Advisor Perspectives, the stock market is somewhere between 33% and 51% overvalued at this point.  In a <a title="recent article" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/market-valuation-overview-yet-more-expensive-october-2-2012-10#ixzz2892nSxib" target="_blank">recent article</a> he offered the following evidence to support his position&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>● The Crestmont Research P/E Ratio (<a title="more" href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Crestmont-PE-Ratio.php" target="_blank">more</a>)</em></p>
<p><em>● The cyclical P/E ratio using the trailing 10-year earnings as the divisor (<a title="more" href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/PE-Ratios-and-Market-Valuation.php" target="_blank">more</a>)</em></p>
<p><em>● The Q Ratio, which is the total price of the market divided by its replacement cost (<a title="more" href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Q-Ratio-and-Market-Valuation.php" target="_blank">more</a>)</em></p>
<p><em>● The relationship of the S&amp;P Composite price to a regression trendline (<a title="more" href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Regression-to-Trend.php" target="_blank">more</a>)</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Peter Schiff</strong></p>
<p>Peter Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, has been one of the leading voices in the financial community warning people about the crisis that is coming.</p>
<p>During a recent interview <a title="with Fox Business" href="http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/1671808352001/schiff-upcoming-recession-worse-than-2008/" target="_blank">with Fox Business</a>, Schiff stated that the massive financial collapse that we witnessed back in 2008 &#8220;wasn&#8217;t the real crash&#8221; and he boldly declared that the &#8220;real crash is coming&#8221;.</p>
<p>So is Schiff right?</p>
<p>We shall see.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Wiedemer</strong></p>
<p>Economist <a title="Robert Wiedemer" href="http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/economy-2008-crash-schiff/2012/06/15/id/442489#ixzz287PqF531" target="_blank">Robert Wiedemer</a> warned people what was coming before the crash of 2008, and now he is warning that what is coming next is going to be even worse&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The data is clear, 50% unemployment, a 90% stock market drop, and 100% annual inflation . . . starting in 2012.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Harry Dent</strong></p>
<p>Financial author <a title="Harry Dent" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2012/10/02/october-stock-market-crash-proof/1601355/" target="_blank">Harry Dent</a> believes that the stock market could fall by as much as 60 percent in the coming months.  He is convinced that stocks are hugely overvalued right now&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We have the greatest debt bubble in history. We will see a worldwide downturn. And when you are in this type of recessionary environment stocks should be trading at five to seven times earnings.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So are these guys right?</p>
<p>We shall see.</p>
<p>But I do find it interesting that some of the biggest names in the financial world are currently making moves as if they also believe that a massive financial crisis is coming.</p>
<p>For example, as I have written about <a title="previously" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/startling-evidence-that-central-banks-and-wall-street-insiders-are-rapidly-preparing-for-something-big">previously</a>, George Soros has dumped all of his holdings in banking giants JP Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Infamous billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson, the man who made somewhere around <a title="20 billion dollars" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704533904574543713428787876.html" target="_blank">20 billion dollars</a>betting against the U.S. housing market during the last financial crisis, is making massive bets <a title="against the euro" href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/investors-preparing-for-collapse-of-the-euro-a-849747.html" target="_blank">against the euro</a> right now.</p>
<p>So where are these financial titans putting their money?</p>
<p>According to <a title="the Telegraph" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/gold/9486294/Are-we-about-to-see-a-Chinese-gold-rush.html" target="_blank">the Telegraph</a>, both of these men are pouring enormous amounts of money into gold&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There was also news last week in an SEC filing that both George Soros and John Paulson had increased their investment in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest publicly traded physical gold exchange traded fund (ETF).</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Soros upped his stake in the ETF to 884,400 shares from 319,550 and Mr Paulson bought 4.53m shares, bringing his stake to 21.3m.</em></p>
<p><em>At the current price of about $156 a share, these are new investments of about $88m of Mr Soros’ cash and more than $700m from Mr Paulson’s funds. These are significant positions.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So why would they do this?</p>
<p>Why would they pour millions upon millions of dollars into gold?</p>
<p>Well, it would make perfect sense to put so much money into gold if a massive financial crisis was coming.</p>
<p>So is the next financial crisis imminent?</p>
<p>We will see.</p>
<p>Most &#8220;financial analysts&#8221; that appear in the mainstream media would laugh at the notion that a stock market crash is imminent.</p>
<p>Most of them would insist that everything is going to be perfectly fine for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In fact, most of them are convinced that quantitative easing is going to cause stocks to go even higher.</p>
<p>After all, isn&#8217;t quantitative easing supposed to be good for stocks?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t I <a title="write an article just last month" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/how-qe3-will-make-the-wealthy-even-wealthier-while-causing-living-standards-to-fall-for-all-the-rest-of-us">write an article just last month</a> that detailed how quantitative easing drives up stock prices?</p>
<p>Yes I did.</p>
<p>So how can I be writing now about the possibility of a stock market crash?</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t I contradicting myself?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>The first two rounds of quantitative easing <a title="did indeed drive up stock prices" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/how-qe3-will-make-the-wealthy-even-wealthier-while-causing-living-standards-to-fall-for-all-the-rest-of-us">did indeed drive up stock prices</a>.  The same thing will happen under QE3, <strong>unless</strong> the effects of QE3 are overwhelmed by a major crisis.</p>
<p>For example, if we were to see a total collapse of the derivatives market it would render QE3 totally meaningless.</p>
<p>Estimates of the notional value of the worldwide derivatives market range from 600 <strong>trillion</strong> dollars all the way up to 1.5 <strong>quadrillion</strong> dollars.  Nobody knows for sure how large the market for derivatives is, but everyone agrees that it is absolutely massive.</p>
<p>When we are talking about amounts that large, the $40 billion being pumped into the financial system each month by the Federal Reserve during QE3 would essentially be the equivalent of spitting into Niagara Falls.  It would make no difference at all.</p>
<p>Most Americans do not understand what &#8220;derivatives&#8221; are, so they kind of tune out when people start talking about them.</p>
<p>But they are very important to understand.</p>
<p>Essentially, derivatives are &#8220;side bets&#8221;.  When you buy a derivative, you are not investing in anything.  You are just gambling that something will or will not happen.</p>
<p>I explained this more completely in a previous article entitled &#8220;<a title="The Coming Derivatives Crisis That Could Destroy The Entire Global Financial System" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-coming-derivatives-crisis-that-could-destroy-the-entire-global-financial-system">The Coming Derivatives Crisis That Could Destroy The Entire Global Financial System</a>&#8220;&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A derivative has no underlying value of its own.  A derivative is essentially a side bet.  Usually these side bets are highly leveraged.</em></p>
<p><em>At this point, making side bets has totally gotten out of control in the financial world.  Side bets are being made on just about anything you can possibly imagine, and the major Wall Street banks are making a ton of money from it.  This system is almost entirely unregulated and it is totally dominated by the big international banks.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the past couple of decades, the derivatives market has multiplied in size.  Everything is going to be fine as long as the system stays in balance.  But once it gets out of balance we could witness a string of financial crashes that no government on earth will be able to fix.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Five very large U.S. banks (including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Bank of America) have combined exposure to derivatives in excess of <a title="250 trillion dollars" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/five-banks-account-96-250-trillion-outstanding-derivative-exposure-morgan-stanley-sitting-fx-de" target="_blank">250 trillion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that U.S. GDP for 2011 was only about 15 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>So we are talking about an amount of money that is almost inconceivable.</p>
<p>That is why I cannot talk about derivatives enough.  In fact, I apologize to my readers for not writing about them more.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the coming financial collapse, one of the keys is to understand derivatives.  Our entire financial system has been transformed into a giant casino, and at some point all of this gambling is going to cause a horrible crash.</p>
<p>Do you remember the billions of dollars that JP Morgan announced that they lost a while back?  Well, that was caused by derivatives trades gone bad.  In fact, they are still not totally out of those trades and they are going to end up losing<a title="a whole lot more" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/893711-jpmorgan-loss-could-be-next-shock-event?source=email_rt_article_title&amp;ifp=0" target="_blank">a whole lot more</a> money than they originally anticipated.</p>
<p>Sadly, that was just the tip of the iceberg.  Much, much worse is coming.  When you hear of a major &#8220;derivatives crisis&#8221; in the news, you better run for cover because it is likely that the entire house of cards is about to start falling.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t get too caught up in the exact timing of predictions.</p>
<p>If a stock market crash does not happen this month, don&#8217;t think that the storm has passed.</p>
<p>A major financial crisis <strong>is</strong> coming.  It might not happen this week, this month or even this year, but without a doubt it is approaching.</p>
<p>And when it arrives it is going to be <strong>immensely</strong> painful and it is going to change all of our lives.</p>
<p>I hope you are ready for that.</p>

<p>Severe drought spread rapidly across the central US this week, further damaging staple crops and heightening the risk of a global food crisis. The Midwest, where roughly one-third of the world’s staple grains are produced, is experiencing the deepest dry spell in over half a century.</p>
<p>The National Drought Mitigation Center in a statement Thursday reported “tremendous intensification of drought through Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Arkansas, Kansas and Nebraska, and into part of Wyoming and South Dakota in the last week.” Almost 30 percent of the Midwest is under extreme drought, triple that of the previous week.</p>
<div><img src="http://www.wsws.org/images/2012jul/j28-drou-map.png" alt="map" width="480" height="360" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>Every state in the country had some counties under abnormally dry or drought conditions, making the disaster the most widespread US drought since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared 1,369 counties across 31 states disaster areas—officially the largest US disaster on record.</p>
<p>“It’s getting to the point where some of the damage is not reversible,” said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the center. “The damage is done, and even with rain, you’re not going to reverse some of these problems, at least not this growing season.”</p>
<p>With temperatures remaining in the triple digits across the Midwest, scattered rainstorms did little to restore moisture to topsoil. Iowa State University agronomist Roger Elmore said that over the week, “most of the state got a quarter- to half-inch of rain. We lose the equivalent of a quarter-inch of moisture every warm, sunny day.”</p>
<p>Meteorologists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center have warned that the high heat and dry spell could extend through October. Through June, the year has been the hottest ever recorded for the US. Globally, land temperatures likewise broke all previous records last month. The extreme weather corresponds to projections issued by climatologists over the past three decades, indicating the worsening impact of global warming.</p>
<p>“This year is very emblematic of the type of thing we worry about with climate change,” David Lobell of global warming monitor Climate Central told ABC News. “The new normal for agriculture is going to be frequent episodes of very high temperatures. Temperatures at which pretty much any crop does not do very well.”</p>
<p>For the seventh consecutive week, the USDA on Monday downgraded its assessment of corn and soybean crops. For the week ending July 22, the portion of the corn crop rated in “poor” and “very poor” condition rose to 45 percent. Thirty-five percent of soybean acreage was rated poor to very poor. Purdue University agricultural economist Chris Hurt told the <em>World Socialist Web Site</em> in a recent interview that a rating of “very poor” likely meant such crops were “approaching no yield.”</p>
<p>Since June 3, the portion of corn rated in “good” to “excellent” condition plummeted from 72 to 26 percent. Seven of the largest corn-exporting states now have only one percent or less of corn acreage assessed as “excellent.” A similar plunge was recorded in soybean acreage (65 to 31 percent).</p>
<p>The assessment is the worst since the drought of 1988, when small farmers went out of business en masse after a decade-long rural economic crisis.</p>

<p>The impact of the agricultural disaster on the global food supply is compounded by a speculative frenzy on grain futures on the Chicago Board of Trade. Last week corn futures surpassed all-time records at $8.2875 a bushel, before falling back on news of rain. As of Friday, corn for September delivery was trading at $7.9375 a bushel. Some analysts have suggested that corn futures for December delivery could fetch $9 or more per bushel in August if climate predictions prove correct.</p>
<p>With pastures in ruin and feed prices driven up in trading, smaller US livestock producers are facing the prospect of liquidating their herds. As a result, supermarket prices for beef, pork, and other meats are likely to surge in the coming year, after the initial influx of slaughtered herds. Prices for quick-to-market meats such as chicken and eggs, as well as dairy products, will likely rise more swiftly.</p>
<p>The USDA on Wednesday announced that supermarket prices would rise in coming months. Currently it projects beef prices will rise 4 to 5 percent, and dairy products 3.5 to 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>However, large meat producers are warning that cheaper meats such as pork and chicken will become “luxuries” if Washington does not suspend a program enabling the energy industry to secure up to 40 percent of the US corn crop for ethanol production.</p>
<p>“I’ll use the word catastrophe—that’s my definition,” Larry Pope, head of Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer, told the <em>Financial Times</em>. In June, Smithfield moved to lock in feed costs on the futures markets before corn broke $8 a bushel. “I thought that $6 corn was the end of the world,” he said. “I never could have realized that I would be thankful to be buying it at $7.”</p>
<p>“Beef is simply going to be too expensive to eat,” Pope said. “Pork is not going to be too far behind. Chicken is catching up fast… Are we going to really take protein away from Americans?” He said US meat prices would rise by “significant double digits” per year.</p>
<p>Even a less drastic price increase in protein food sources would compell millions of low-income Americans to choose what they can afford to buy over the nutritional value provided.</p>
<p>The disaster bears brutal consequences for the populations of import-dependent countries across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean. In 2008, riots erupted in more than 30 countries after a similar confluence of severe weather and speculation drove up staple food prices. Among the billions of people living on $2 a day or less, the cost of food consumes as much as three-quarters of a family’s income.</p>
<p>Grain suppliers are beginning to default on deals with importers in Egypt, Libya, and Iraq. Egypt, the world’s largest consumer of wheat, is turning to Russia as the US drought deepens. However, Russia has also cut its wheat outlook by 3 million tons.</p>
<p>The US corn outlook negatively impacts wheat exports, as a poor corn harvest tends to mean wheat is held more tightly for domestic use. Because Egypt imports half of its wheat, and a quarter of its wheat imports originate in the US, any fluctuation in the grain’s price or supply sharply impacts living conditions in the country. Forty percent of the Egyptian population subsists on $2 a day or less.</p>
<p>The world’s population is subjected to the irrationality of the market, and the disjointed global food system.<strong> </strong>Barges loaded with Southeast Asia-bound grain have clogged Indian ports, creating delays of up to 25 days. Spotty rains in Asian growing regions may further compound food shortfalls and inflation.</p>
<p>“The deficit in rainfall will definitely cause food inflation to go up,” Dun &amp; Bradstreet economist Arun Singh told Reuters. “The extent of the impact will be known only after the monsoon is over.” With monsoon season half over, some agricultural areas of the country have seen rainfall 68 percent lower than average. Food inflation in India is already 10.81 percent, significantly higher than general inflation; on lentils, chickpeas, potatoes, and other staples, the rise is far higher.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/nasdaq-market-site3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/nasdaq-market-site2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>I first came to national attention back in 2008 and 2009 when the housing and credit markets imploded. I became known as the guy that other market “experts” laughed at when I warned of trouble brewing in the seemingly indestructible American economy. After the wheels ground to a halt in mid-2008, people noticed that my book <em>Crash Proof,</em> originally released in early 2007, read like a detailed preview of many of the events that eventually unfolded.</p>
<p>Three years later I am now catching heat from many who assume that my predictions actually fell short. They argue that I was able to anticipate the crash but that I severely underestimated the resiliency of the American economy. They admit that we took an “unexpected” blow to the chin, and that it left a lingering bruise, but they argue that we never hit the canvas like I predicted we would.</p>
<p>However, they mistakenly assumed that the crash I was warning about was solely a housing led credit bubble. While that was part of it, I never saw it ending there. The crash that most concerned me was the one that would result from the government’s response to the initial crisis. My concern was not that our economy would succumb to the disease that I had diagnosed, but instead would be taken down by the “cure” that the government unleashed to combat it.</p>
<p>When the government’s delaying tactic, which involves continuous borrowing and money printing is no longer tenable, the dollar could collapse, interest rates and consumer prices could soar and the U.S. economy could implode. That’s the real crash that I was warning about, and the one we all need to be worried about now.</p>
<p>This is the subject of my new book “<em><a href="http://www.europac.net/recommended_reading" target="_blank">The Real Crash: America’s Coming Bankruptcy, How to Save Yourself and Your Country</a></em>.”  For now it is just a prophecy but as with my first book, it soon may be regarded as history. Unfortunately, the policies of both the Bush and Obama administrations, and the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/ben-bernanke">Ben Bernanke</a> led Federal Reserve, have vastly raised the chances that my catastrophic view will come to pass.  However, it’s not all gloom and doom — I devote a large majority of the book to solutions. The real crash may be inevitable, but what we do in response is not. We can follow on the path that I recommend back to prosperity, or we can continue on our current course which I believe will lead to economic ruin.</p>
<p>When looking back from a point in the future, I believe that the years immediately after the credit collapse of 2008 will stand out as a period of dangerous economic negligence. We have bought ourselves some time by sweeping enormous problems under the rug. Through a combination of political cowardice, economic ignorance, and false confidence, we are digging ourselves into a hole so deep that it may take generations to crawl out.</p>
<p>Most people assume that half way through 2012 we have made some important positive strides since flirting with the brink of economic catastrophe in the dark days of 2008. Although no one is wildly celebrating the below trend 2 to 3 percent GDP growth, we are continuously reminded that we have turned the corner and that our situation is better than many other regions around the world. But what has really changed?</p>
<p>Immediately prior to the crash, the United States economy was experiencing unprecedented consumer debt levels, persistently high <a id="itxthook0" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-real-crash-2012-5#" rel="nofollow">trade</a> deficits, historically large government budget deficits, high-energy prices, and a moribund manufacturing sector. Four years later, all of these problems have gotten worse. And unlike four years ago, we are now saddled with the highest unemployment rate in generations and levels of public debt that would have been unimaginable then. Yes we are no longer technically in recession. But I believe that is just an illusion created by perhaps the cheapest, and most obvious, trick ever devised.</p>
<p>I had argued that our <a id="itxthook1" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-real-crash-2012-5#" rel="nofollow">economic growth</a> prior to the crisis was largely a function of the real estate bubble. When that bubble popped, I knew that the economy would have to shrink. And that’s just what happened. From 2008 to 2009 our national GDP (of around $14 trillion) contracted by $212 billion. To prevent any further dips, the government aggressively spent, borrowing heavily to do so. To the relief of just about everyone, these moves did stop the nominal contraction. From 2010 to 2011 the U.S. GDP expanded by $502 billion, and from 2011 to 2012 it added an additional $508 billion. All told, from the end of 2008 the U.S. economy added a cumulative $798 billion in GDP. But those gains came at a very high price.</p>
<p>The combined federal deficits for the same time frame come in at a staggering $4.2 trillion! In 2009 alone the feds chalked up a chart breaking $1.4 trillion in debt (the deficit was a mere $161 billion in 2007). In other words, we borrowed five times more than we grew. This “strategy” for growth is no different from an individual who loses half his income, but continues to spend by running up credit card debt. Could this be described as economic growth? But that’s just how we are describing our current economy, and for the large part, expert economists, politicians, <a id="itxthook2" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-real-crash-2012-5#" rel="nofollow">investors</a>, and academics all agree.</p>
<p>I felt certain before writing <em>Crash Proof</em> that the government would never let the economy contract far enough to restore balance and sustainability. I knew the spending and deficits would head off the charts. I thought those realities would push down the dollar and cause foreign creditors to shun American government debt. However, I did not factor in the reprieve we have gotten from the false perception that Europe is in even worse shape than we.</p>
<p>As the curtain eventually falls on the drama unfolding in Europe, the world will refocus its attention on the more spectacular events in the U.S. The sovereign debt crisis that is now playing out in Europe will cross the Atlantic, and when it opens here <a title="The Real Crash" href="http://www.europac.net/recommended_reading" target="_blank">The Real Crash</a> may indeed finally begin. The average American will have a front row seat but will hardly enjoy the show.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/raptureforsale2.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/raptureforsale2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Apocalyptic fever is running high.  A friend in the Bible Belt, who recently became “born again,” called me excitedly to tell me she was leaving me her house. “In case I suddenly vanish,” she confided.</p>
<p>Of course.  She would be raptured up and I, a hard core “One God” believer, would be left behind. How sweet of her to make preparations for the damned.</p>
<p>But the projected date for the rapture came and went and disappointed, my friend abandoned her new found religion. Not so fast for the 2012-er&#8217;s however.  The end of the world is still scheduled for December 21, 2012 according to those who buy into the Mayan prophecies, Planet X, Niburu, exponential solar flares –did I miss anything?</p>
<p>The scenarios are stunning&#8212;tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, as the world comes crashing down around us.</p>
<p>And should we awaken the morning of December 22 to find ourselves still alive, the ratcheting up of doomsday prophecies will deflate like a spent balloon.</p>
<p>And we just may find ourselves sucker-punched.</p>
<p>Lurking right under our noses is the specter of what may occur in 2013.  While another war in the Middle East and a global pandemic might pale in comparison with the cataclysmic changes promised by the 2012-ers, the result might be very close to the same thing. We may not see the hand of God reach down and pluck His faithful from this troubled planet, we may not see  benign aliens beam themselves down into our living rooms while the walls are imploding around us, but the effect of what the governments of the world have cooked  up may result in a similar upheaval.</p>
<p>The announcements that the global pandemic will hit in 2013 have hardly been ear splitting.  One has to be attentive to find these predictions, which are being made by such insiders as former Senators Jim Talent and Bob Graham (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2M0eZ9GAdc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr>v=j2M0eZ9GAdc</wbr></a>) both of the WMD center (<a href="http://www.wmdcenter.org/" target="_blank">http://www.wmdcenter.org/</a>).  Also weighing in on the 2013 Big Bug scenario is Dr. Daniel Gerstein of the Department of Homeland Security. Gerstein made this prediction during a side event hosted by the US at the <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/12/questions-persist-as-to-us-arms-treaty.html">Biological Weapons Convention</a> just last December. </p>
<p>And what would be the connection between a global pandemic and those attending to biological weapons, like Graham, Talent and Gerstein?</p>
<p>A parallel thread runs through this last decade, right alongside the events of 911 and the fallout from that event. The parallel thread pertains to the anthrax attacks, which took place only one week later. Our government responded to the attacks of 911 with a Draconian shift towards a top heavy surveillance society and a concomitant stripping of our civil liberties, all of which has  made us increasingly vulnerable to government intrusion and attack.  Emphasis on the word “attack.” The response to the anthrax mailings was to invest billions of dollars in a biological warfare program for which there is no transparency and no public oversight.</p>
<p>Since September of 2001, the U.S. government has pumped over 60 billion dollars into what it euphemistically terms “biodefense.” Let&#8217;s take a moment to consider what has gone into that program and what has come out the other end.  The concept of “dual use” is the first thing we must consider in order to understand what constitutes “biodefense.”  To put it simply, dual use means that you first have to create the bug in order to find the cure.</p>
<p>And our biodefense program is top heavy with bugs: ebola, marburg, anthrax, we got ‘em and we are secretly working to cut and splice natural horrors into recombinant nightmares.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the crux of the matter.  What goes on in these “biodefense” labs  are occluded by protestations of “national security.” The now defunct Sunshine Project, which was dedicated to   working “against the hostile use of biotechnology in the post-Cold War era,” found that there was little if  any oversight as to the types of research going on in these labs.  In 2007,  in a <a href="http://www.nobio.org/hammondtestimony.pdf">report</a> submitted to the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for the Hearing: Germs, Viruses, and Secrets: The Silent Proliferation of Bio-Laboratories in the United States, Sunshine Project Director Edward Hammond wrote the following: “Our research indicates that in the vast majority of cases, it is not possible to verify that federally funded research is properly overseen at the local level, nor are the local committees that are charged with overseeing this research actually required to produce meeting minutes or annual reports that demonstrate that they have fulfilled this charge.” Elsewhere in the report, he states that “lab expansion under the Bush administration has gone far beyond what is prudent and necessary, and without an adequate regulatory framework.”</p>
<p>In summary, Hammond blasted the biodefense industry and wrote “The proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories across the United States since 2002 is greater than what our country needs and what its safety and security net can absorb. One-off NEPA processes are not sufficient or appropriate for this national-scale problem .Congress should impose a moratorium on federal funding for construction and commissioning of new biodefense labs. No new construction contracts should be issued, and no new labs should open until a comprehensive needs assessment is performed by the Government Accountability Office.”</p>
<p>One must ask what has come out of all these billions pumped into biodefense.  The answer is clouded. We do know that we have not even produced a second generation anthrax vaccine. The first generation anthrax vaccine was reputed to cause Gulf War Syndrome and other ills. A scientist working in a BSL-3 in Arizona proudly informed me recently that he has developed a smallpox vaccine that also cures herpes.  Awesome, bro&#8230;except we pretty much stomped out smallpox decades ago&#8230;.</p>
<p>When informed of the plans for a new biodefense campus at Ft. Detrick, Maryland, local activists became alarmed.   Beth Willis, chairwoman of the Frederick County Containment Lab Advisory Committee and founder of Frederick Citizens for Biolab safety, has stated concerns that the plans for the Homeland Security lab at Detrick may be in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention.  The DHS facility has opened but is not yet fully operational. While some of the Frederick activists have stopped short of declaring that the US has indeed launched an offensive biological weapons program, others are not so shy. Barry Kissin, an attorney and activist in Frederick has stated that the US is now illegally producing and stockpiling biological weapons.</p>
<p>In order to produce biological weapons you must first have a lab, properly outfitted for the seriousness of bug you are working with. The labs are designated from BSL-1 through 5, with the 3’s and 4’s housing the most dangerous bugs known to man. The 5&#8242;s purportedly deal with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety">space bugs</a>, although you wouldn´t ever hear that from the CDC. That agency recently responded to a FOIA Request about the containment specifications for the 5’s, stating that these records were not in their office. The CDC, which has the responsibility for tracking these bugs and registering the labs, is furiously shoveling out disinfo about the proliferations of 3’s and 4’s ,   tripping over itself in its eagerness to convince us that there are no more BSL-3 and 4 labs than before 911.</p>
<p>In fact, the proliferation of these labs has been astounding. There are at least 1360 BSL-3&#8242;s at this juncture, according to documents released by the DOJ and DOE  (although the CDC insists the number is closer to 250).  The CDC can only count as far as six when it comes to BSL-4s, although independent sources, such as the Federation for American Scientists, have come up with a head count of 13. Factor in the existence of secret labs on military bases, evidenced by the C.V.&#8217;s of a couple of engineering firms which proudly state that they constructed BSL-4s on at least two  bases, and the numbers of these labs , like Topsy, just keep on growing.</p>
<p>If a global pandemic should hit in 2013, the chances are good that we will have caused it through the release of a biological weapon that has been cooked up in one of these labs. The similarities between what is now happening in the US and what happened in Germany in the thirties are perturbing: A false flag event used to topple our civil rights and a project to poison us with &#8230;well, this time it won&#8217;t be Zyklon- B.</p>
<p>If our government learned anything from the mistakes made by Adolph Hitler, it was to keep appearances up.  The public image maintained by the United States is that of freedom and justice. The image is straining due to the weight of evidence to the contrary, and the more evidence that accumulates the higher pitched are the denials being issued by the State.</p>
<p>This reporter has been working off information provided by a high level source back in 2003, when he confided that the State of Israel would be destroyed around the time that the bugs were selectively released.   Israel, you say?  You thought Israel was pulling the strings all along, did you?</p>
<p>Israel was very likely set up to be destroyed.  A haven for the Jews after the horrific events of WWII and the holocaust morphed into a ghetto for those far- flung in the diaspora.  Forty percent of the world’s Jews now reside in Israel. A well placed missile or two and you&#8217;ve gotten rid of 7,848,800 people–approximately 5,865,300 are Jews.  Hitler will be high- fiving from the seventh circle of Hell.</p>
<p>The government of Israel is just itching to get into this war with Iran, a war for which Israel is poorly prepared, defensively speaking.  The much touted  “Iron dome”, Israel’s primary missile defense system, only works for incoming projectiles that are launched from nearby, like Gaza.  Israel is largely unprotected from a fly- over. Factor in the state- of- the- art S-300 defense system possessed by Iran, and the odds that Israel will survive this war appear to be almost non- existent.</p>
<p>Israel wiped off the map due to all the trouble fomented by the United States in the Middle East, culminating with a manufactured war with Iran and then a fatal bug, released through a selective mechanism such as the double line water system (<a href="http://neworleans.indymedia.org/news/2007/05/10214.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://neworleans.indymedia.<wbr>org/news/2007/05/10214.php</wbr></a>) or the imposter pharmaceuticals&#8212; and  there you have the makings of another  holocaust, all done under the mantle of plausible deniability.  The US comes out squeaky clean, as it scampers to innoculate its citizenry with vaccinations which may serve to further reduce its population, while insisting that all along, we tried to support Israel.</p>
<p>The hell, you say. The Zionists run the world! Well, yes and no. If the Zionists are the same guys, heavily anti-Semitic, (such as Mark Sykes and Otto Rand, ) who set up the State of Israel in order to lure the world’s Jews into that alleged haven—a desert mirage&#8211; so that Boom! Then yes, those Zionists may indeed run the world. And some of those Zionists are Jews. The Jews are ill informed as to the traitors within their midst, the same sort of saboteurs as Stephen Wise, head of the US Jewish Congress during WWII.  Wise lobbied heavily to keep the Eastern European Jews from immigrating to the United States, thus ensuring they would be unable to escape Hitler’s death machine. This reporter has had her own skirmishes with duplicitous leadership in the Jewish community, some of which are discussed in this <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/08/our-spiritual-leadership-stumbles-and.html">article</a>.</p>
<p>And please, don&#8217;t get me wrong. The Jews are certainly not the only ones on the chopping block. When the dust clears, after the Big Bug strikes, we will likely see a world divested of much of its people of color. This is already happening.</p>
<p>Africa is being emptied out by AIDS.  Dark- skinned people are also now experiencing an epidemic of the “silent killers” of diabetes and hypertension, believed to be a product of a biological weapon leaked into food and attaching onto melanin (those with darker skin have more melanin). According to Dr. Trudy Gaillard, a researcher and with the Wexner Medical Center, about 12% of African Americans are now diagnosed with diabetes, three times as many as reported in 1980.  The actual figures may be quite a bit higher. If you look at the statistics for African American women over the age of 55, 25% are now diagnosed with diabetes.  The numbers are also up for other dark- skinned groups, such as indigenous Mexicans and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>Dr. Wouter Basson, who sailed through the South African Truth and Reconciliation hearings, was under scrutiny for his work with Project Coast, which was the apartheid government’s biological weapons group.  Basson was purportedly working on developing a “blacks only” bioweapons back in the 1980’s  The epidemic of diabetes and hypertension among people of color began to surface shortly thereafter. Was Basson successful in creating this race specific bioweapons? He ain’t talking.</p>
<p>And, as a writer-friend in Los Angeles once noted, “Anyone who will sell out his brother for his own safety gets to sit at the table.” The resonant and beautiful voices of resistance may also succumb to the selectively delivered Big Bug.  How convenient and diabolical this plan is.  Any problem person, any out- of -favor demographic group, and our beneficent government utilities and/or Big Pharma will provide the final solution. No recriminations and no onus of responsibility. No Nuremberg Trials, no Truth and Reconciliation Commission and no one pointing the finger at anything except a wayward microbe, an accident of nature.</p>
<p>Just a whole lot of burying to do and the world made over, in a different image: Obedient and lily white. A Nazi&#8217;s wet dream.</p>
<p>The Biological Weapons Convention will meet twice this year in Geneva for intersessional meetings.  I hope to be able to attend in an effort to impact the direction of the above cited course of events. I need your help to do so. Please visit <a href="http://janetphelan.com/" target="_blank">janetphelan.com</a> to contribute for travel expenses via PayPal.  At the BWC in December, I <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=13482">blew the whistle</a> on the illegal biological weapons program being run by the United States government. It was a good beginning and so much more needs to be done. The time is short.</p>

			<p><img src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5-New-Lies-That-The-Federal-Reserve-Is-Telling-The-American-People-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" />The Federal Reserve says that everything is going to be okay.  The Fed says that unemployment is going to go down, inflation is going to remain low and economic growth is going to steadily increase.  Do you believe them this time?  As you will see later in this article, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has been dead wrong about the economy over and over again.  But the mainstream media and many Americans still seem to have a lot of faith in the Federal Reserve.  It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter that Bernanke and other Fed officials have been telling the American people lies for years.  As I always say, most people believe what they want to believe, and many people seem to want to have blind faith in the Federal Reserve even when logic and reason would dictate otherwise.  The truth is that things are not going to be getting much better than they are right now.  When the next wave of the financial crisis hits, the U.S. economy is going to fall back into recession, financial markets are going to crash and unemployment is going to absolutely skyrocket.  But you will never hear any of that from the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>The following are 5 new lies that the Federal Reserve is telling the American people.  After each lie I have posted what The Economic Collapse Blog thinks is actually going to happen&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> The Federal Reserve says that the labor market has improved and that unemployment is going to decline significantly over the next few years.</p>
<p>The following is a quote from the FOMC press release that was released on Wednesday&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Labor market conditions have improved in recent months; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve is projecting that the unemployment rate will fall within the range of <a title="7.8 percent and 8.0 percent" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20120425.pdf" target="_blank">7.8 percent and 8.0 percent</a> by the end of 2012.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is also projecting that the unemployment rate will fall within the range of <a title="6.7 percent and 7.4 percent" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20120425.pdf" target="_blank">6.7 percent and 7.4 percent</a> by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>The Economic Collapse Blog says that the labor market <a title="has not improved" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-shocking-truth-about-unemployment-in-america-in-one-chart">has not improved</a>.  In March 2010, <a title="58.5 percent" href="http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000" target="_blank">58.5 percent</a> of all working age Americans had a job.  Exactly two years later in March 2012, <a title="58.5 percent" href="http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000" target="_blank">58.5 percent</a> of all working age Americans had a job.  If the labor market was improving, the percentage of working age Americans with a job should have gone up.</p>
<p>The Economic Collapse Blog also says that while there is a chance the official unemployment rate may go down slightly in the short-term, the truth is that it is going to go up into double digits once the next wave of the financial crisis hits us.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> The Federal Reserve says that that U.S. economy is going to experience solid GDP growth over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>In fact, the Federal Reserve is projecting that U.S. GDP will be rising at an annual rate that falls between <a title="3.1 percent and 3.6 percent" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20120425.pdf" target="_blank">3.1 percent and 3.6 percent</a> by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>The Economic Collapse Blog says that a great economic cataclysm <a title="is coming" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/27-statistics-about-the-european-economic-crisis-that-are-almost-too-crazy-to-believe">is coming</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;When the European banking system crashes (and it will) it is going to reverberate around the globe.  The epicenter of the next great financial crisis is going to be in Europe, and it is getting closer with each passing day.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The Federal Reserve says that we can expect low inflation for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is officially projecting that the annual rate of inflation will not be higher than <a title="2.0 percent" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20120425.pdf" target="_blank">2.0 percent</a> by the end of 2012.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reinforced this projection during his press conference on Wednesday&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“But we expect that to pass through the system, and assuming no new shocks in the oil sector, inflation ought to moderate to about 2 percent later this year.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Economic Collapse Blog says that the Fed is being tremendously dishonest and that if inflation was measured the exact same way that it was measured back in 1980, the annual rate of inflation would be <a title="more than 10 percent" href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts" target="_blank">more than 10 percent</a> right now.</p>
<p>The truth is that most <a title="middle class families" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/25-signs-that-middle-class-families-have-been-targeted-for-extinction">middle class families</a> know that we do not have low inflation right now.  This is hammered home millions of times a day when average Americans visit the gas station or the grocery store.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the next recession inflation will likely subside, but that will only be because economic activity will be slowing down dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> The Federal Reserve says that it has built up a 30 year reputation for keeping inflation low.</p>
<p>Ben Bernanke actually had the gall to make the following claim during his press conference on Wednesday&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we’ve been able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four, five years to support the economy.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>The Economic Collapse Blog says that the <a title="Federal Reserve" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> has nearly a 100 year reputation for destroying the value of the U.S. dollar.  Even using the Fed&#8217;s doctored numbers, the value of the U.S. dollar has declined <a title="by more than 95 percent" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-your-dollar-got-to-be-worth-just-38-cents-2012-2" target="_blank">by more than 95 percent</a> since 1913.</p>
<p>To get a really good idea of just how much the dollar has been destroyed by the Fed over the years, just check out <a title="this chart" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Purchasing-Power-Of-The-Dollar.png">this chart</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says that we should trust him because the Federal Reserve stands ready to do whatever is necessary to support the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If appropriate&#8230; we remain entirely prepared to take additional action&#8221;</p>
<p>The Economic Collapse Blog says that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is doing a great disservice by not warning the American people about the tremendous crisis that is coming.  In a <a title="recent article" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/22-red-flags-that-indicate-that-very-serious-doom-is-coming-for-global-financial-markets">recent article</a> I stated that this next crisis will blindside most Americans just like the last one did&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Sadly, just like back in 2008, most people will never even see this next crisis coming.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So who should you trust &#8211; the Federal Reserve or all of the half-crazed bloggers out there that are warning about the &#8220;<a title="serious doom" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/22-red-flags-that-indicate-that-very-serious-doom-is-coming-for-global-financial-markets">serious doom</a>&#8221; that is coming.</p>
<p>Well, come back to this article in a year or two and compare how accurate the predictions were.</p>
<p>In the end, time will tell who is telling lies and who is not.</p>
<p>If we do not learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s take a quick look at Ben Bernanke&#8217;s track record over the past several years.</p>
<p>The following are statements that Bernanke <a title="actually made to the public" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/say-what-30-ben-bernanke-quotes-that-are-so-stupid-that-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-or-cry">actually made to the public</a>&#8230;.</p>
<p><a title="#10" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/barack-obama-and-ben-bernanke-continue-to-defend-quantitative-easing-but-for-the-rest-of-the-world-the-verdict-is-in-they-hate-it">#1</a> (July, 2005) &#8220;We’ve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis. So, what I think what is more likely is that house prices will slow, maybe stabilize, might slow consumption spending a bit. I don’t think it’s gonna drive the economy too far from its full employment path, though.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="#2" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/say-what-30-ben-bernanke-quotes-that-are-so-stupid-that-you-wont-know-whether-to-laugh-or-cry">#2</a> (October 20, 2005) &#8220;House prices have risen by nearly 25 percent over the past two years. Although speculative activity has increased in some areas, at a national level these price increases largely reflect strong economic fundamentals.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="#15" href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_senate_hearings&amp;docid=f:26610.wais" target="_blank">#3</a> (November 15, 2005) &#8220;With respect to their safety, derivatives, for the most part, are traded among very sophisticated financial institutions and individuals who have considerable incentive to understand them and to use them properly.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="#3" href="http://financialservices.house.gov/media/pdf/109-72.pdf" target="_blank">#4</a> (February 15, 2006) &#8220;Housing markets are cooling a bit. Our expectation is that the decline in activity or the slowing in activity will be moderate, that house prices will probably continue to rise.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="#12" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20070214a.htm" target="_blank">#5</a> (February 15, 2007) &#8220;Despite the ongoing adjustments in the housing sector, overall economic prospects for households remain good. Household finances appear generally solid, and delinquency rates on most types of consumer loans and residential mortgages remain low.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="#9" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20070328a.htm" target="_blank">#6</a> (March 28, 2007) &#8220;At this juncture, however, the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained. In particular, mortgages to prime borrowers and fixed-rate mortgages to all classes of borrowers continue to perform well, with low rates of delinquency.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="#18" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070517a.htm" target="_blank">#7</a> (May 17, 2007) &#8220;All that said, given the fundamental factors in place that should support the demand for housing, we believe the effect of the troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will likely be limited, and we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.  The vast majority of mortgages, including even subprime mortgages, continue to perform well.  Past gains in house prices have left most homeowners with significant amounts of home equity, and growth in jobs and incomes should help keep the financial obligations of most households manageable.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="#4" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22592939/" target="_blank">#8</a> (January 10, 2008) &#8220;The Federal Reserve is not currently forecasting a recession.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="#26" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aH6u3wsqwMFM&amp;refer=home" target="_blank">#9</a> (June 10, 2008) &#8220;The risk that the economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry, Ben Bernanke insists that he knows exactly what is going on this time.</p>
<p>So do you believe him?</p>
<p>A lot of Americans don&#8217;t.  In fact, an &#8220;economic collapse&#8221; is <a title="the number one catastrophic event" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-number-one-catastrophic-event-that-americans-worry-about-economic-collapse">the number one catastrophic event</a> that Americans worry about according to one recent survey.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is one reason why so many Americans are <a title="preparing for doomsday" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/why-are-millions-of-americans-preparing-for-doomsday">preparing for doomsday</a> these days.</p>
<p>The central planners over at the Federal Reserve are not going to solve our economic problems.</p>
<p>The truth is that the Fed is <a title="at the very heart" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/10-things-that-every-american-should-know-about-the-federal-reserve">at the very heart</a> of our economic problems.</p>
<p>We have been living in the greatest debt bubble in the history of the world and that debt bubble has been facilitated by the Fed.</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, the total amount of debt in America has increased<a title="by about 50 trillion dollars" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/one-nation-under-debt-with-endless-debt-slavery-for-all" target="_blank">by about 50 trillion dollars</a>.  By stealing from future generations, we have been able to live like kings and queens, but there is going to be a great price to pay for our foolishness.</p>
<p>Ben Bernanke and the other folks running the Federal Reserve are just going to keep insisting that everything is going to be okay for as long as they possibly can.  They are going to tell you that they know exactly how to fix things and that the economy will be back on track very soon.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be stupid and believe them this time.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/overpopulationglobe3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/overpopulationglobe2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>While some of the great minds in history wrestled with humanity’s ability to feed itself, the general populace doesn’t understand nor does it possess a clue as to what we face in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  Humans race toward adding another three billion to the current seven billion to reach 10 billion in less than 40 years.  Malthus, Darwin, Ehrlich, Heinberg, Bartlett, Alpert and other giants understood/understand humans’ ability to overpopulate their ability to feed themselves.</p>
<p>Even the green revolution man stated it concisely.  Norman Borlaug, <a title="" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-lecture.html" target="_blank">while accepting the Nobel peace prize in 1970</a>, said: &#8220;The green revolution has won a temporary success in man&#8217;s war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, I receive incredibly chastising letters from religious, emotional, clueless and scientifically out of touch individuals weekly about how humanity will find new energy through technology, etc.  Much of it is as mythical as the second coming of Jesus, Buddha, Krishna and other great teachers of the path that have been anointed as “gods” themselves instead of what they were—simple men of the spirit.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>Dr. Paul Ehrlich suffered much criticism with his Population Bomb in 1968.  He made predictions that have manifested as 18 million humans starve to death annually. Nonetheless, his detractors love to fault him. But they can’t!   Borlaug nailed it and we must deal with it.</p>
<p>Weekly, I participate in a very special discussion with over 100 of the top minds in the country on environment and overpopulation.  My friend, David Paxson, director of <a href="http://www.worldpopulationbalance.org/" target="_blank">www.worldpopulationbalance.org</a> spoke recently and he enjoyed some feedback.</p>
<p>David, I listened to the radio interview. I thought you did an excellent job; however I think you have some rough spots that can be improved upon.  The critic is John Taves:</p>
<p>1) One example is where you pointed out the mistake that Paul Ehrlich made when he predicted dire consequences in a certain time frame. I totally agree with you that that was a mistake. Ehrlich should not have made predictions. My point is that you subsequently made the exact same mistake when you said that Ehrlich&#8217;s predictions are NOW coming true. There is no need to state that they are now coming true.</p>
<p>2) When she said &#8220;some people say that the planet will take care of the population numbers&#8221;, I thought your answer was weak. I prefer something along these lines.</p>
<p>Of course the planet will limit our numbers, but that is NOT a solution, that is the problem. If we continue to create babies faster than people die of old age, nature will be forced to stop the population growth by killing people faster, and at least fast enough to keep up with how fast we create new babies. But it is worse than that. We must consume oil, for example, in order to feed our current 7 billion. If we do not burn oil, we cannot produce food fast enough to feed ourselves. You can imagine the oil reserves are stock piles of food. As that stock pile of food runs out, our numbers must decrease because we have no ability to keep 7 billion alive without digging into that pile of food.</p>
<p>In addition, your answer was technically wrong when you said that the planet is not limiting the growth today. This is not terribly important for the audience you were speaking to in that interview, but it is a huge problem with experts. Nature IS limiting the growth and generally always has been limiting our numbers. Populations grow exponentially, and humans have been around for a long time, thus our numbers have always been throttled by nature. There are temporary exceptions to this.</p>
<p>For example, when humans discovered farming techniques, we raised the limit of what can be provided for and our numbers grew to the new limits. A more recent example is what has happened in North America for the past 500 years. European diseases decimated the native population numbers and for the next 500 years improved techniques for providing for our numbers have ensured that the limits of what can be provided for have expanded faster than the population has grown. The population numbers in NA have not yet caught up to what can be provided for (notice &#8220;provided for&#8221; is not the same as &#8220;can be sustained&#8221;, which means I totally agree that we are overpopulated).</p>
<p>However, Ethiopia and many other countries that are suffering a replacement rate above 2, are indeed experiencing the horror of nature limiting their numbers. The limit has not been a hard cap. The numbers are increasing, but the numbers are not increasing as fast as they would if the area was well below what could be provided for. In short, deaths are occurring today because of the fact that too many births are happening today. That last sentence is the key point. We have to recognize that births above a certain rate, cause deaths, and we have to recognize that we have always been above that rate. As part of the &#8220;overpopulation education&#8221; that you are advocating, I am trying to insert the fact that we must recognize that births cause deaths.</p>
<p>You seemed to acknowledge this later when you spoke about the horrible conditions in many poor countries, but then you seemed to disagree with it when you cited the fact that the recent huge population growth was caused by the decrease in the death rate. There is a subtle error when demographers tell us that for much of human history the birth rate and the death rate matched each other and thus our numbers did not grow.</p>
<p>This statement is true, but it suggests that this was good and that somehow the birth rate magically matched the death rate. It makes much more sense to say that whenever you see a stable population and an uncontrolled birth rate, the death rate was forced to rise to match the birth rate. It is true that nature also lowers the birth rate, but it does this by totally unpleasant means. The point I am making is that we humans did not throttle our birth rate, thus nature throttled our population numbers by raising the death rate. The subtle rephrasing that I just did is very important to get the message across that we have a moral responsibility to limit our births.</p>
<p>3) Your answer to the man that suggested that we should all become vegetarians was too long and inefficient. You should have said something like the following: Yes, we can all become vegetarians, and drive Priuses and use CFLs, but none of that will solve the problem if we continue to create babies faster than people die of old age. So consuming less per capita is not a solution. If we recognize that we must not create babies faster than old age, it should be possible to limit our birth rate even lower such that our numbers decrease. If we can do that, there&#8217;s no reason that our population numbers should level off at some number where we are just able to sustain ourselves as long as we eat no meat. Why not maintain that lower birth rate for more time such that our numbers drop well below that level, so that there is no problem eating meat?</p>
<p>You sort of comprehended this when you made it clear that by going vegetarian, and Prius, and CFLs, we simply enable a larger population. But you were not terribly crisp in making the point that ultimately the birth rate is the only possible solution.</p>
<p>The Oregon study you quoted is a fine example of a muddy point. Ultimately that study makes no sense. You stated that the study concludes that the birth of another child is 20 times more costly than other options. That study is attempting to tell us the cost of adding another human to the world. To do that they have to make an assumption about the birth rate, which is the exact thing that the study&#8217;s information will affect. I am going to use a better definition of &#8220;birth rate&#8221; to explain this. Ask each adult right before they die how many children they created. Each person will be counted twice. Once by the mother and once by the father. This number is what I call &#8220;the average number of children&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the study assumes that the average number of children is above 2, the additional birth is meaningless. The population is attempting to grow to infinity, thus the cost of the additional human is infinite. It is not 20x. If the average number of children is below 2, then the additional birth is also meaningless, it won&#8217;t change the fact that the population will go to zero. In short, you cannot put a finite cost to the existence of another human. If that human&#8217;s descendants average more than 2, then the cost is infinite.</p>
<p>You talked about how we all need to have an overpopulation education and I totally agree. Part of that education will be new definitions. For example, the definition of birth rate that demographers use is pathetic. Births per 1000 is the demographer&#8217;s unit of measure. It does not matter what &#8220;births per X&#8221; you use. The &#8220;per x&#8221; shifts the concept to the wrong units. The concept we must get to is found in the definition I created. The definition of &#8220;average number of children&#8221; allows us to &#8220;go up stream&#8221; as you put it. The &#8220;upstream source&#8221; of all of this is how many children we average. If we average more than two, we cause our numbers to <em>attempt </em>to grow to infinity. Thus we have a moral obligation to NOT average more than two.</p>
<p>In the end, Dr. Paul Ehrlich is dead on the money and so is Malthus, Bartlett, Heinberg, Catton, Darwin and more.</p>

				<p>April 10, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14397#comments" title="Comment on A Simple Explanation of Scofield Dispensationalism"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="14397 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14397">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rapturecemetary3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rapturecemetary2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>A flaw foundation lies under most evangelicals’ understanding of God&#8217;s moral dealings with humanity and particularly Jews. This foundation drives their support of the Jewish state. It is called “Scofield Dispensationalism.” It says that throughout successive epics, or &#8220;dispensations,&#8221; of time God has revealed Himself through extremely different moral standards. The law given before the Flood was different from the law after. The law given to Moses is completely different from what we now observe in the millennia after Christ. Cyrus Scofield lived at the turn of the 20th century and created an annotated Bible which claimed to lay out each dispensation&#8217;s unique requirements.</p>
<p>Scofield&#8217;s commentaries have greatly influenced evangelicals to this day. Written at the dawn of the modern Zionist movement, they suggested a nation of suffering and persecuted Jews, though Christ-rejecting, had a divine right to return and occupy Palestine.  This idea was virtually absent from Christianity before the mid-1800s. How did such permission gain so great a foothold that it’s now unquestioned dogma for most evangelicals?</p>
<p>It starts with a defect in the King James Bible. King James scholars mistranslated 2 Thess. 2:7.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only He who now letteth [restrains] will let, until He be taken out of the way. And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming…</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual New Testament Greek says the one who restrains, the Holy Spirit, is <em>not</em> passively removed. Instead He &#8220;gets out of the way&#8221; or &#8220;steps aside&#8221; (<em>ek meseu genetai</em>). The Holy Spirit is never going to be taken out of this world. God owns the world. He is not about to be removed by a mere satanically inhabited man, Anti-Christ.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years Christians were unbothered by the King James Bible&#8217;s error. Yet in the first half of the 19th century, a Scottish Presbyterian minister, Edward Irving, seized on the mistranslated passage. He saw its profound prophetic implications. He said that since the Holy Spirit would be removed from this world just prior to revealing of Anti-Christ, so Christ&#8217;s church must also be removed, for Christians cannot function without the Holy Spirit. That removal is described, they said, in 1 Thess. 4:16.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. . .&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, said Irving and his later disciple, John Nelson Darby, these passages from II Thessalonians suggest <em>two </em>second comings of Christ: the first, when Christ descends and removes the Holy Spirit and all believers, both dead and living unto Himself. Then, three and half, He comes a second time. In His final second coming He converts remnant Jews, judges the nations, and begins His thousand-year reign on earth from Jerusalem.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Beginnings of &#8220;Pre-Tribulationism&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Irving and Darby&#8217;s &#8220;prophetic breakthrough&#8221; had an electric appeal to evangelical Christians, particularly in the British Isles and North America. It assured Christians that, “raptured,” they would not have to endure the suffering that follows revealing of Anti-Christ. Thus began the &#8220;pre-tribulationist&#8221; interpretation of Bible prophecy. It started with a mistranslation of one verse by King James scholars. Incredibly, that disastrous mistranslation is repeated in most modern translations of the Bible.</p>
<p>Enter Cyrus Scofield.  He did not originate the pre-tribulationist rapture craze that has enthralled evangelicals and made millionaires of &#8220;prophecy experts” such as Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHaye. Yet Scofield did something far more damaging: he laid the keel of Christian Zionism. He taught that, under the dispensation Abraham was in, God gave the patriarch and his physical descendants unconditional rights as God&#8217;s chosen people. They were guaranteed the Promised Land and rights of occupation, even without obedience. Scofield said Israelites automatically receive “all blessings” by just being there.</p>
<p>Yet Scofield said Jacob and his sons, during world famine, unwisely left security in Palestine and went to Egypt. In doing so, he claims, they lost their ability to please God by simply staying in the Holy Land. Scofield contends that, even worse, they foolishly accepted the Mosaic Law at Sinai 400 years later. The Law imposed on them an onerous obligation to obey God on penalty of exile. Such conditional terms of occupation, Scofield said, didn’t exist under the &#8220;pure grace&#8221; that Abraham and his descendants enjoyed while in Palestine. (See, <a href="http://truthtellers.org/biblestudies/ConditionalSalvationVerseList.html" target="_blank">List of Conditional Salvation/Occupation Verses</a>)</p>
<p>Scofield said of the dispensation and covenant Abraham enjoyed:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>That covenant is wholly gracious and unconditional. The descendants of Abraham had but to abide in their own land to inherit every blessing. In Egypt they lost their blessings, but not their covenant. The dispensation of promise ended when Israel rashly accepted the Law (Ex. 19:8). Grace had prepared a deliverer (Moses), provided a sacrifice for the guilty, and by divine power had brought them out of bondage (Ex. 19:4); but at Sinai they exchanged grace for law. (<em>Scofield Reference Bible, </em>1909, page 20)</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Scofield conveniently omits the biblical record that God powerfully delivered Jacob and his sons from death by famine, providing safe haven for them under Joseph&#8217;s protection in Egypt. Similarly, God <em>commanded</em> the Hebrews at Sinai to obey the Mosaic Law. Scofield&#8217;s idea that simply staying in Canaan guaranteed to Hebrews &#8220;every blessing&#8221; is an affront to God&#8217;s timeless moral standards which say that in every age we are justified by trusting and obeying God. Only through such faith do we inherit &#8220;every blessing&#8221; from Him. Scofield&#8217;s view of the sanctifying power of the Holy Land, even for reprobate Jews, powerfully anticipated the teachings of the most extreme present day Israel-firsters who believe Jews to be so morally advantaged that they have a separate covenant of salvation and land rights without obedience to Christ.</p>
<p>Yet, Scofield said, when Jesus came and died at Calvary, God returned to a dispensation entirely of grace. This, by inference, means to millions of evangelical readers of the Scofield Bible that our present “age of grace” does away with the requirement of dozens of Old Testament verses demanding obedience for Jews to occupy Palestine.</p>
<p>Scofield, as no other figure, legitimized Christian participation in a Jewish political movement: Zionism. Evangelicals then united pretribulationism and its “rapture escapism” with Zionism. The new prophetic script for Christians read like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The right of God’s dispersed and persecuted chosen people to the Promised Land is covenanted to them by God unconditionally, forever. It is the duty of every Christian to honor God’s great last day’s regathering of His people, bidding them godspeed by any possible means. If any nation or person refuses to stand by God and the Jewish nation, he is in league with Satan.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Satan desires above all things to obscure the fact that Israel makes possible fulfillment of biblical prophecy that empowers Jesus to return as predicted. Without Israel’s existence and the hundreds of prophecies it fulfills, Christ cannot return. Christ stated clearly that “it must needs be that Scripture be fulfilled” before He could go forward with God’s plan.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Criticizing the state of Israel is thus to oppose the Almighty. It is to curse the Jewish people, incurring dire judgment. “I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you…” (Genesis 12:3)  </em></strong></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In accordance with an end-times storyline created by Darby, Irving and Scofield, Zionist evangelicals now keenly watch Israel for necessary fulfillment of the following Scriptural predictions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rebuilding a Jewish temple. The new temple is necessary because Scripture says anti-Christ must profane it and sit in it proclaiming himself to be god. Without such a temple and its defilement, Christ cannot return as He predicted.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Israel enters a “covenant” or peace treaty with Anti-Christ.<br />
</strong><strong>Once such a covenant has taken place, Daniel’s prophetic “clock” of a “week” or seven years leading to Christ’s <em>second </em>second coming will begin to tick.</strong><strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem, however, for pretribulationists is this: If the church is to be raptured when the anti-Christ is “revealed,” what does Scripture mean by that term? Does it mean “revealed” as in anti-Christ signing a peace treaty with Israel or “revealed” such as occurs in the middle of Daniel’s week when anti-Christ manifests himself as the enemy of the Jews, bringing his armies against Jerusalem (Ez. 38). At that time, he desecrates the temple, kills two thirds of Jerusalem’s inhabitants, and exiles the remainder to the nations. Also, since most evangelicals believe Christ could come in his first second coming and rapture us out without preconditons, perhaps we will not even have to wait for the “revealing” of Anti-Christ at all.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Zionist evangelical prophetic scenario at this point becomes very clouded. But it is not at all clouded up to that point. The pretribulationist view point could not be simpler in its obligations: Dark as the world may become, if the church above all things makes sure to bless Israel, it will be blessed and kept safe. Jesus will be faithful to take out true believers before anything resembling great tribulation begins. In reality, nothing could be more unbiblical, corruptive to the church and the Jewish people, and ultimately dangerous to Christianity than building up that Zionist one-world system of oppression Scripture calls Babylon the Great. (See, <a href="http://truthtellers.org/alerts/babylonthegreatisrael.htm" target="_blank">&#8216;Babylon the Great&#8217; is Israel</a>)</p>
<p>Pre-tribulationism is thus escapism. Calvinists also very largely adhere to this idea.  It fits well with their belief that once we are soundly “born again” we are always saved, even if committing the grossest sin. If we as citizens fail in our duty to occupy and resist evil, this Calvinist/pretribulationist theology says Jesus understands. He will not require us to bear the consequences of our neglect. We will soon be gone. The consequences will be passed on to those of our children who are not born again, not fortunate enough to be raptured.</p>
<p>Of course, Scripture does promise a first resurrection or “rapture” of the dead and living of Christ at <em>His </em>second coming. Yet a high percentage of evangelicals actually believe the rapture will occur within several years. What’s the point of knocking ourselves out opposing evil, especially as Jewish big media corrupts our children…because very soon we’ll be in heaven? (See, <a href="http://truthtellers.org/alerts/jewsconfirmbigmediaupdated.html" target="_blank">Jews Confirm Big Media is Jewish</a>)</p>
<p>We clearly see such apathy right now as ABC gores the church through its Christian-bashing sitcom “Good Christian Bitches.” But there is a virtual absence of Christian willingness to publicly oppose it. This largely originates in the ingrained belief that, if the power of evil proves too great, Christ no longer expects us to be the salt of the earth, resisting evil with all that is within us. Instead, we should buckle up for heavenly removal.</p>
<p>Yet Jesus said that the church would <em>not</em> be taken out of tribulation. Instead, He said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation.” (John 16:33) In China before 1949 a highly evangelized Chinese population also accepted pre-tribulationism, believing the church had little to fear from “anti-Christ” Mao Tse Tung and his armies. They would be raptured before great tribulation came. Yet deliverance for millions of pre-tribulationist Chinese came not through rapture, but death.</p>
<p>One of the paramount reasons Christians must understand <em>how</em> the church has gone so far astray is so we may marshal ourselves to hold back anti-Christian offensives leading to persecution. “Good Christian Bitches” is one such offensive that simply must not remain unopposed. If it is, it will only beget worse attacks, leading to outright persecution. Someday, if the church remains apathetic and pre-tribulationist like the Chinese Christians, American Christians will be standing in front of firing squads. They are about to be taken out of this world, not out of the mercy of the rapture, but the &#8220;mercy&#8221; of a bullet.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/us-population-growth3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/us-population-growth2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>America added 115 million people from 1965 to 2012.  Demographic experts showed 315 million people living in America in January 2012.  They expect an added 85 million by 2035 to reach 400 million.   The consequences grow irreversible and unsolvable.</p>
<p>As population rises, carrying capacity drops.  What is “carrying capacity?”  For a quick rendition, it means, “The amount resources on a given piece of land to allow long term sustainable human, plant and animal life.”</p>
<p>If animals or humans exceed ‘carrying capacity’ of any given land mass, they crash in numbers by various means, i.e., famine, war and disease.  Garrett Hardin, noted biologist called it, “The Tragedy of the Commons.”  (Source:<a href="http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/" target="_blank">www.GarrettHardinSociety.org</a>)</p>
<p>For the 7.1 billion humans in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and headed for 10.2 billion in 40 years, oil resources will define that capacity quotient.  Noted Geologist Walter Youngquist said, “This is going to be an interesting decade, for the perfect storm is brewing—energy, immigration and oil imports.  China grows in direct confrontation for remaining oil.  I think the USA is on a big, slippery downhill slope.  Will the thin veneer of civilization survive?” To see how fast we grow, visit<a href="http://www.populationmedia.com/" target="_blank">www.populationmedia.com</a></p>
<p>“Cassandra Syndrome”: The Cassandra Syndrome is a term applied to predictions of doom about the future that are not believed, but upon later reflection turn out to be correct. This denotes a <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological<br />
Psychological" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological" target="_blank">psychological</a> tendency among people to disbelieve inescapably bad news, often through denial. The person making the prediction is caught in the dilemma of knowing what is going to happen but not being able to resolve the problem.  The origin of the name is derived from <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra<br />
Cassandra" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank">Cassandra</a>, who, using her prescience, foresaw the demise of Troy. No one believed her.</p>
<p>Youngquist continued, “Beyond oil, population is the number one problem of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, for when oil is gone as we know and use it today—and it WILL be gone—population will still be here.”</p>
<p>The world uses 84 million barrels daily.  That’s 42 gallons to a drum.  By mid century, China, now placing 27,000 new cars on its highways every seven days, expects to burn 98 million barrels of oil daily—all by itself!  Oil will run out because of limited reserves in the ground.

<p>Dr. Albert Bartlett of the University of Colorado said, “Present population growth rate is putting our children at risk.  They will experience holes in the ozone causing serious biological effects on plants and humans.  World ocean fisheries are collapsing from endless plundering.  Two thirds of the world’s people will suffer from water shortages by 2025.  It is not possible to sustain population growth or growth in rates of consumption of resources.”</p>
<p>Where is the worst overpopulation problem on the planet according to Dr. Bartlett?  “It’s right here in the United States!”</p>
<p>Dr. Bartlett said, “Can you think of any problem, on any scale, from microscopic to global, whose long-term solution is in any demonstrable way, aided, assisted, or advanced, by having continued population growth—at the local level, the state level, the national level, or globally?”</p>
<p>How many people in the United States are enough?  How far down the gopher hole do we want to dig ourselves?  At what point is enough—too much?  If we shut down the borders today with zero immigration, while enjoying our sustainable 2.03 fertility level of American women on average, we would still grow via “population momentum” by an added 40 million.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re painting ourselves into a perilous corner. Once the numbers manifest, our society will suffer irreversible consequences with unsolvable problems.  One visit to Los Angeles will show you they suffer toxic air, dwindling safe drinking water, gridlock to the point of insanity, water shortages, endless highways and housing development.  Consider San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Detroit, Denver and all other large cities grow beyond the bounds of reason!</p>
<p>Sustainable growth, slow growth, managed growth, smart growth and all other kinds of growth are oxymoronic.  There is no such thing as sustainable growth.  Why? All growth exceeds carrying capacity at some point.  In other words, the bubble bursts, the dam breaks, the glass spills, the balloon pops and the red-lined engine blows up.</p>
<p>“Population growth is given as a cause of the problems identified, but eliminating the cause is not mentioned as a solution,” Bartlett said. “We are prescribing aspirin for cancer.”</p>
<p>At the current rate of growth driven by immigration, America will double its population just past mid century—from 300,000,000 to 600,000,000.  As long as the underlying cause of a problem is not dealt with, we, and our leaders, as a nation, perpetuate a falsehood which Mark Twain called ‘silent-assertion’:  “Almost all lies are acts,” he said.  “I am speaking of the lie of ‘silent-assertion’.  It would not be possible for a humane and intelligent person to invent a rational excuse for slavery; yet you will remember that in the early days of emancipation in the North, agitators got small help from anyone.  They could not break the universal stillness that reigned from the pulpit and press all the way down to the bottom of society&#8211;the clammy stillness created and maintained by the lie of silent-assertion that there wasn’t anything going on in which intelligent people were interested.</p>
<p>“The conspiracy of the silent-assertion lie is hard at work always and everywhere, and always in the interest of a stupidity (unlimited growth) or sham (unlimited immigration), never in the interest of the respectable (average citizens).  It is the most timid and shabby of all lies.  The silent-assertion is that nothing is going on which fair and intelligent men and women are aware of and are engaged by their duty to try to stop.”</p>
<p>Silent-assertion worked until it brought China, India and Bangladesh to their knees with sheer misery of numbers.  How do I know?  I’ve spent a lot of time in Asia and other overpopulated regions.  China, even with enforced one child per family, grows by 8 million annually. India, with 1.2 billion, adds 12 million yearly.  Bangladesh suffers 157 million people in a landmass the size of Iowa.  Do you see anyone racing to immigrate to those havens of human overload?</p>
<p>What I ask is, do we as a nation, want millions upon millions of added people from countries already exceeding their carrying capacity?  Legal immigration proves as dangerous as illegal.  To think otherwise will allow that silent-assertion to create another China or India in America.  Just imagine Iowa with 157 million people and all the rest of the United States with THAT kind of population density!</p>
<p>Albert Einstein said, “The problems in the world today are so enormous they cannot be solved with the level of thinking that created them.”</p>
<p>We are no longer living in the 20<sup>th</sup> century America with only 75 million people riding horses or trains.  We’re in the 21<sup>st</sup>century with cars and jets and 315 million people added to the 7.1 billion on the planet&#8211;creating horrific environmental consequences.  Again, we had to change our ‘silent-assertion’ about slavery and we MUST change our ‘silent-assertion’ about population growth and economic growth.  If we continue steaming full speed ahead like the captain of the Titanic, our children will be on board when we hit the peak oil, global warming, ozone holes, collapsing species, air pollution and other commensurate problems related to the overpopulation “iceberg.”  Most died on the Titanic because there weren’t enough life boats.</p>
<p>Maybe some of us choose to maintain our ‘silent-assertion’ in the face of growing consequences, but how can any parent or grandparent be that callous to their children?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ecology-and-capitalism3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ecology-and-capitalism2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Contrary to everything we have been taught, there is no actual United States of America. The U.S. is an occupied territory that could more accurately be described as the Corporate States of America. If the geopolitical states are united, the people are not. We are a nation divided by ideology and by social and economic class. The U.S. is not a democracy and it never was. The systems of power do not allow the voice of working people to be heard or their collective will to be acted upon.</p>
<p>Despite the subterfuge of freedom and democracy, the rights of corporations have consistently superseded the sovereign rights of the individual and those of the community. Labor history and a litany of environmental catastrophes bear this out. For instance, everywhere one looks government agencies, ostensibly created to protect the public welfare, are allowing hydraulic fracturing of Marcellus shale, even when it poisons municipal drinking water and causes incalculable harm to the environment.</p>
<p>Our diverse forests are commodified, measured in board feet to be clear-cut and off-shored at prodigious bargain rates, like a liquidation sale. World class biodiversity is yielding to desertification and monoculture. Money changes hands. The few are getting rich at the expense of the many. The world and the people who live in it are treated like products to be exploited. We are told that nothing is sacred, save for the dollar and markets.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is an inescapable fact that no human being, including corporate CEOs and members of Congress, can live without potable water or breathable air. We are literally sacrificing the Earth’s life support systems and mortgaging the future, while attempting to satiate the greed of a few grotesquely wealthy individuals. Through lifelong indoctrination, Americans are persuaded that self-interested greed is in their best interest.</p>
<p>The rich and powerful have decreed that corporate profits, the Holy Grail of American capitalism, are more precious than life itself. The remorseless people in power are without conscience. History confirms that sociopaths do not hesitate to take what they want from their unsuspecting victims by any and all means.</p>
<p>But surely, even among Friedmanites, it must be allowed that some things cannot be commodified or bought and sold. For instance, clean air and potable water are the birthright of every living organism. These are necessities that belong to the commons; they cannot ethically be privately owned. In contrast to this assertion, two edicts of modern capitalism are private ownership and the commodification of workers and nature.</p>
<p>Capitalism, and the market fundamentalism that is associated with it, has stripped bare the Earth’s biodiversity and substituted a world of commodities in its stead. What we see and think we know is not real. It is the product of marketing and perception managers—a hologram.</p>
<p>There is growing conflict between capitalism and the planet’s ecology, its essential life support systems. A fierce struggle between capital and democracy is in progress. The booted foot of capitalism is pressing upon the throat of democracy. We inhabit a dying world and are inheriting dying freedoms. Corporate greed and over-population is the culprit. Conflict is everywhere.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the social upheaval, inequality, and environmental problems of today in some way ensue from capitalism, including overpopulation and armed aggression. Capitalism requires continuous economic expansion and a burgeoning market for consumers. This is simply not possible on a finite planet.</p>
<p>These tensions are manifested no more clearly than throughout the coal belt and mountains of West Virginia, where I make my home. Here, mountains are cleared of forests before being blown to smithereens in order to cheaply extract coal to enrich Massey Energy Corporation. The process, known as mountaintop removal, has poisoned streams, altered their courses, and changed the contours of the land and its hydrology. It has devastated both human and biological communities while filling the coffers of the timber and coal industries.</p>
<p>Conventional underground mining has claimed the lives of thousands of coal miners trying to scratch out a modest living from the Earth. At times, it has led to armed conflict between miners and the Pinkertons hired by the mining companies in places like Matewan and Blair Mountain.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, King Coal and the gas and oil industry run the state’s legislature. The government is effectively owned by corporate lobbyists. As a result, it is futile to make legal and moral appeals to government for redress of our grievances. If we limit ourselves to the tools that our oppressors provide us, the entire region will become a sacrifice zone. Working people and the poor make the sacrifices; billionaires and industry carry off the profit. We are left to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>The illusion of democracy, including voting in the absence of meaningful choice, is a poor substitute for direct action and anarchy. Democracy cannot flourish in the sterile soil that capitalism leaves in its wake. Either we have democracy or we have capitalism, or we create something entirely different. Radically opposing ideas cannot be reconciled.</p>
<p>Modern humans inhabit a human-engineered world of absurdities and contradictions. Regardless of the Supreme Court’s assertions, corporations are not people, and money is not speech. Every sentient human being knows this. However, the law says otherwise. We must deny the corporate state that victory by refusing to capitulate.</p>
<p>The struggle for community rights, egalitarianism, and social, economic, and environmental justice must occur outside of the system that creates inequality and fosters wanton destruction of the commons. Countless species of plants and animals that provide essential ecological services are being eliminated to create space for strip malls, gated communities, gambling casinos and golf courses. As a result, ecological and economic catastrophe loom. We are facing global famine in an anthropocentric over-heated world.</p>
<p>Globally, wealthy multi-national corporations are gorging themselves on the biological and mineral wealth of the commons. What could be more absurd or unethical?</p>
<p>The brainchild of Adam Smith, capitalism, which replaced feudalism during the French Revolution, is founded upon demonstrably false premises, many of which were unknown in Smith’s time. Nevertheless, classically-trained economists assert that capitalism is a primal force of nature rather than the defective human construct that it is. Modern capitalism has produced pathological symptoms and endorsed an ethos that is antithetical to life and to liberty. It is killing the world and foreclosing evolutionary possibilities.</p>
<p>Indeed, ethical considerations aside, and speaking purely from a biological perspective, one may emphatically state that modern capitalism is an aggressive cancer that is devouring its host. But most of us are in denial. People like me are asked not to utter the “C” word in public spaces. It might offend the well-intentioned believers. Whenever this occurs I am reminded of Thoreau, who uttered, “Any truth is better than make believe.” One has an ethical obligation to state what one knows succinctly and clearly.</p>
<p>It is not in dispute that the ideology of constant expansion on a finite planet is contradicted by inviolable ecological dictums—among them, carrying capacity, ecological overshoot, and die-off. But classical economists act as if these laws do not apply, or they are mysteriously overridden by the irrational exuberance of capitalism.</p>
<p>In reality, every political economy is underlain by ecology and by living, evolving, biological systems. Ecology is the only economy that really matters.</p>
<p>By possessing even a modest degree of ecological literacy, one can make some revealing predictions with mathematical certainty. For example, the continuation of capitalism as the primary political economy can have one of two possible outcomes: the virtual destruction of the biosphere, meaning the death of the host organism, or the abolition of the capitalist system.</p>
<p>What would a post-capitalism world look like and how might it work?</p>
<p>Global capitalism, with its dependence on the availability of cheap fossil fuels and petrochemicals for food production, must give way to small-scale local economies and organic agriculture. Food must be locally grown and, as far as possible, other necessities locally produced. The age of cheap fossil fuels is ending. Industrialized man must bravely confront his addictions and embrace sobriety or he will self-destruct.</p>
<p>It is said that nature bats last. Humans do best when they emulate natural systems that have evolved over eons of time.</p>
<p>A moneyless economy based upon need must supplant the current profit-driven system of exploitation. Accordingly, goods and services may then be exchanged without the conduit of markets. These exchanges would be of equal value and thus inherently fair.</p>
<p>The classic business models will be replaced by worker-owned and worker-operated cooperatives. In this arrangement, workers—not a board of directors—make all of the business decisions. They share the risks and benefits and distribute the surpluses of production, while significantly reducing the work day and the work week. A portion of the surpluses of production is allocated to the betterment of the community and to the protection of the commons.</p>
<p>New economic models must be predicated upon ecological principles or they will fail. Existing alternatives to capitalism, such as Spain’s Mondragon Worker Cooperative, must be critically analyzed and evaluated as a model that could, with modifications, be implemented elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is no better teacher than evolution and natural selection. History confirms that the most revolutionary ideas are occasionally the oldest. For instance, anthropological studies indicate that early Homo sapiens evolved by implementing egalitarian principles into their tribal clans. People and the cultures they create must either evolve or perish.</p>
<p>The egalitarian societies of the future will look radically different from the capitalism of today. Political campaigns and elections will recede into history and quickly forgotten. Evolved societies do not need leaders or elected officials.</p>
<p>Every member of an egalitarian community is a leader. Power flows in a circular form rather than a linear, top-down hierarchy. It is derived directly from the people. There will be no social or economic stratification. No one shall have privileges or rights that are denied to others. Every member of the community must be equally empowered and equally valued. All people will have equal access to opportunity. Healthcare and higher education, like pure water and clean air, will be regarded as a right of birth and provided without cost.</p>
<p>Direct action will replace voting in political elections. Rather than consent to be governed, sovereign people can create the world they want to live in. In communities where people are empowered and where they have an equal stake, they will want to participate. Everyone brings something to the table. Everyone contributes and all of society benefits.</p>
<p>Communities will become as interconnected and interdependent as ecological systems. But each will remain autonomous within the larger matrix of nature. States and nations as we know them may eventually recede into history and disappear.</p>
<p>Rather than the callous competition and exploitation nurtured by capitalism, communities can be organized around the principle of cooperation and social need. As in healthy ecosystems, the welfare of the individual is dependent upon the well-being of the community—and vice versa. No one will be left behind. All of us shall rise together.</p>
<p>All living organisms share a common origin and a common destiny. Ecology and economy must merge into an integrated natural system suited to long-term survival in a world already ravaged by industrialized man. Ecological and social healing must be part of the process of building sustainable communities.</p>
<p>The transition from capitalism to cooperation will be neither smooth nor easy. There will be many false starts. At first, there will be fierce resistance to revolutionary change. People cling to the familiar and the comfortable, to what they know, even when the dominant paradigm and popular culture does them harm.</p>
<p>The first tentative steps of a journey are often the most difficult. There are no clear blueprints to follow. There will be trepidation and uncertainty. But we must commit to beginning. The alternative is oblivion. But if we embark on the voyage the survival of the species, and a new age of enlightenment will be possible.</p>

Stephen D. Foster, Jr. has the story.</p>
<p>“Congress is considering HR 3166 and S. 1698 also known as the Enemy Expatriation Act, sponsored by Joe Lieberman (I-CT) and Charles Dent (R-PA). This bill would give the US government the power to strip Americans of their citizenship without being convicted of being ‘hostile’ against the United States. In other words, you can be stripped of your nationality for ‘engaging in, or purposefully and materially supporting, hostilities against the United States.’ Legally, the term ‘hostilities’ means any conflict subject to the laws of war but considering the fact that the War on Terror is a little ambiguous and encompassing, any action could be labeled as supporting terrorism.”</p>
<p>Foster goes on to say, “I hope I’m wrong, but it sounds to me like this is a loophole for indefinitely detaining Americans. Once again, you just have to be accused of supporting hostilities which could be defined any way the government sees fit. Then the government can strip your citizenship and apply the indefinite detention section of the NDAA without the benefit of a trial.”</p>
<p>See Foster’s report at:</p>

<p>Ever since Congress passed the Patriot Act back in 2001, it seems the floodgates have been opened for more and more intrusions and abridgements of those fundamental liberties expressly protected in the Bill of Rights. From the Patriot Act, to the Military Commissions Act, to the NDAA (Indefinite Detention Act), and to now the Enemy Expatriation Act (EEA), these big government toadies in Washington, D.C., are clearly and unmistakingly declaring war on the American people.</p>
<p>I invite readers to see my column on the NDAA at:</p>
<p><a href="http://chuckbaldwinlive.com/home/?p=4382">http://chuckbaldwinlive.com/home/?p=4382</a></p>
<p>Have we forgotten the MIAC report out of the State of Missouri back in 2009? In that official State report, supporters of Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and Chuck Baldwin were identified as potential dangerous “militia members,” and Missouri State law enforcement officials were notified to be on guard. Beyond that, anyone that identified themselves as being pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-Federal Reserve, Christians who believe in the return of Christ, and even returning Iraq War veterans were likewise targeted as potentially dangerous to Missouri State law enforcement personnel.</p>
<p>After the MIAC report surfaced, Ron Paul, Bob Barr, and I sent a letter to the governor of Missouri demanding that the report be removed and that the State of Missouri repudiate the report. After a firestorm of outrage by thousands of Americans all over the country (not just in Missouri) the State of Missouri did indeed remove and repudiate the report.</p>
<p>Totalitarian regimes throughout history have attempted to marginalize those people that the state intended to target for persecution. Once a group or groups of people had been sufficiently marginalized, it wasn’t long before public condemnation and then military retaliation took place. Legislation such as the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, the NDAA, and now the EEA authorize military power to be used against US citizens, and given the propensity of government propagandists in the National Press Corps to marginalize groups of people whose ideas are thought to be politically incorrect, it’s only a matter of time before the executive branch of the federal government begins utilizing the dictatorial powers that have been granted to it by Congress. And, unfortunately, many State governments seem more than willing to participate in the Machiavellian machinations put forward by Washington, D.C. The MIAC report in the State of Missouri is a prime example.</p>
<p>Sadder still is the way so many Christian pastors and churches have become little more than glorified cheerleaders for Statism and Militarism. While the Trojan Horse of Big Government sits unnoticed in Town Square, so-called Christians spend most of their time either trying to kill each other because of differences of opinion over secondary doctrines, or trying to turn their worship services into miniature versions of Walt Disney World.</p>
<p>I ask you, did you hear anything from your pastor regarding NDAA? Did you hear anything from your pastor regarding the Patriot Act or the Military Commissions Act? If not, do you really think you will hear him say anything about the EEA? Again I ask you, are not the fundamental principles of liberty as valuable and as scriptural as the so-called “family values” we hear pastors talk so much about? I would argue that without the undergirding foundational principles of liberty (codified in the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights), the so-called “family values” would become moot very quickly! Before Hitler’s government could begin marching people off to concentration camps, it had to destroy the foundational elements of liberty in the hearts and minds of the German people–including German pastors and churches. A government that doesn’t respect your liberty will not respect your life, your family, your religion, or your morality!</p>
<p>At this point, I invite readers to watch my address from last Sunday, January 8, 2012. In this address, I deal forthrightly with the NDAA and show the scriptural instruction regarding how unlawful and illegitimate government is the chief source of “tribulation” that the Bible talks so much about. I also give a scriptural outline as to how Christian people are to relate and respond to government–both good and bad. Watch my Sunday address at:</p>

<p>While we are on the topic of liberty, someone has produced a fascinating clip of Congressman Ron Paul showing the predictions he made on the floor of the US House of Representatives back in 2002–along with the fulfillment of those predictions in subsequent news headlines. People who view this brief You Tube video might just begin to understand why Congressman Paul is the only Presidential candidate who truly understands the causes of this loss of liberty taking place in our land. See Dr. Paul’s speech on the House floor at:</p>

<p>Given the way congressmen and senators from both major parties are willing to grant dictatorial powers to the President, it seems likely that the EEA will pass in much the same way as did the NDAA. It seems to me that the longer we keep expecting Washington, D.C., to solve our problems, the more our problems will increase. Remember the sagacious words of President Ronald Reagan: “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” Listen to that quote at:</p>
<p><a href="http://chuckbaldwinlive.com/home/?p=145">http://chuckbaldwinlive.com/home/?p=145</a></p>
<p>If we are going to “guard and defend” (Daniel Webster) our liberties, it is going to take states and local communities to do it, because those miscreants in Washington, D.C., are doing everything they can to dismantle our liberties, not protect them. We need State governors, lieutenant governors, attorney generals, and sheriffs to stand in the gap NOW! And in that vein, I invite readers to follow the Fanning-Baldwin Montana gubernatorial campaign at the following Facebook and Twitter pages:</p>

<p>In the meantime, beware! The Enemy Expatriation Act is coming soon, and with the way things are going, YOU could be deemed the enemy!</p>
