<p>Before Federal trolls or indoctrinated government &#8220;true believers&#8221;, starts spreading their slurs, you had better gauge the sentiment in the real America. Seventy-two percent of Americans, in a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166535/record-high-say-big-government-greatest-threat.aspx">Gallop poll</a> say big government is a greater threat to the U.S. in the future than is big business or big labor, a record high in the nearly 50-year history of this question. Yet the &#8220;so called&#8221; authorities would have you accept that only a conspiracy theorist thinks that the great protectors of law and order are capable of routing out Christians, 2nd Amendments advocates, 911 Truth proponents, Tea Party members, Patriot-Liberty groups or Global Warming deniers, and confining them to prison gulags. So when the House introduced <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr645ih/pdf/BILLS-111hr645ih.pdf">HR 645</a>, in 2009 that directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish national emergency centers on military installations, every citizen should feel threatened by its own government.</p>
<p>Here are some of those nasty facts that endanger all of us. The Albuquerque Journal account in the article, <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/390438/news/homeland-security-a-runaway-train.html">MISSION CREEP: Homeland Security a ‘runaway train’</a> should alarm everyone.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, the Department of Homeland Security is the third-largest agency in the federal government, behind only the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense.</p>
<p>When created in 2002, DHS merged 22 pre-existing federal agencies into one, marking the largest reorganization of the federal government in more than 50 years. Among the agencies included under the Homeland Security umbrella are the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>In the first year of its existence, the Department of Homeland Security employed 180,000 full-time workers. Today, 240,000 people collect paychecks from the agency, according to its website.</p>
<p>The department&#8217;s budget has more than doubled since the agency&#8217;s inception in 2003, when it spent $29 billion. This year, DHS is slated to spend $61 billion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/ReEmergence-of-FEMA.jpg.w300h196.jpg" alt="ReEmergence-of-FEMA.jpg" width="300" align="Right" /><br />
Beginning at its inception, Homeland Security had all the telltale indications that a militarized national interment force was designed to segregate, if not bury, domestic ‘enemies of the state&#8221;.</p>
<p>From the executive summary, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-fema-camps/7763">US FEMA Camps</a> published by the Geopolitical Monitor states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In August 2002, then Attorney General John Ashcroft called for American citizens who are deemed &#8216;enemy combatants&#8217; to be detained indefinitely without charge and independently of the judiciary. This legal position was upheld in the case of a US citizen detained abroad by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a January 2003 ruling.</p>
<p>For some time FEMA has been renovating and constructing new detention camps throughout the country. In January 2006 Haliburton subsidiary KBR announced that it had been awarded an &#8220;indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contract to construct detention facilities for the Department of Homeland Security worth a maximum of $385 million over 5 years.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Stated Purpose</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Little has been said about the purpose of the detainment camps but when official comment has been made it has stated that the camps are for the temporary detainment of illegal immigrants.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>PLEASE, if that objective was true, how does one explain away the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/05/15/Valerie-Jarrett-We-Have-a-Commitment-from-Boehner-to-Try-to-Pass-Amnesty">Breitbart</a> reporting that &#8216;We Have a Commitment&#8217; From Boehner on Amnesty This Year? At the same time, the Obama administration demonstrates that their own <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/14/immigration-releases-convicted-felons/9090557/">Government released hundreds of immigrant felons</a>. Only a fool would believe that this FEMA fairy tale yarn about their detention facilities. Dave Hodges of <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2014/05/16/these-men-are-training-to-put-you-and-your-family-in-a-fema-camp/">The Common Sense Show</a> always reveals the true unpleasant details that most Americans are afraid to confront. In his article, <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/11/12/cbs-news-admits-fema-camps-are-real/">CBS News Admits FEMA Camps Are Real</a>, a leaked <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/07/31/you-can-lead-a-sheep-to-knowledge-but-you-cant-make-them-think/">memo</a> from KBR manager, Bob Siefert, referenced a disturbing call for the installation of fencing and wire used for large-scale detention of prisoners.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Subcontractors will mobilize, transport, erect, install and demobilize temporary fencing, barricades, and associated equipment according to federal, state and local laws, codes and manufacturer installation instructions. The Subcontractor shall be able to mobilize and deploy key personnel(s) within four (4) hours of NTP to meet with KBR Site Manager at the Responder Support Camp (RSC) site in order to finalize the site design plan and acquire site-specific design requirements and layout. Number of linear footage:</p>
<p>&#8220;Approximately 2,300LF for a 301 person camp after 36 hours of NTP&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Approximately 3,600LF for 1,000 person camp after 72 hours of NTP&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds like FEMA camp activation to me and it closely parallels the FEMA camp events on the East Coast in the aftermath of Sandy.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>Since so many apolitical mentally challenged flag wavers, accept the myth that <a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/081813.html">I&#8217;m From The Government and Here To Help</a>, even in the face of stark reality, the only rational conclusion is to expect the worst. The Nolan Chart features an essay by Walt Gelles, <a href="http://www.nolanchart.com/article10577-time-to-abolish-the-fema-camps-html">Time To Abolish The FEMA Camps</a>, that succinctly makes the case for questioning the true purpose of Homeland Security constructed FEMA internment camps.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The FEMA camps are ready… Eight hundred empty secret prisons, detention centers, concentration camps scattered around the U.S.A.-fully operational, surrounded by full-time armed guards, and ready to receive prisoners.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s Homeland Security Department bought 1.6 billion bullets using your taxpayer dollars. That&#8217;s five bullets for every man, woman, and child…five bullets waiting to pierce your skull…hollow-point bullets, sniper bullets, forbidden under international law for use in war. Plus 2,700 military tanks for domestic use, and Obama has created a para-military police force operating under Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Do you think those 1.6 billion bullets were intended for a bunch of Arab terrorists trying to take over a Walmart or an airport? Think again. Do you really believe the FEMA camps were built to house Muslim fanatics or flood victims? Get real. Go ask Hillary Clinton what the FEMA camps are for. Go ask Nancy Pelosi or John Boehner or President Obama/Soetoro. You&#8217;re paying billions of dollars for the government to put you away.</p>
<p>Most of the 800 FEMA camps can house up to 20,000 prisoners. That works out to 15 million Americans the government is ready to lock up. All the camps have railroad facilities, and the boxcars have been built to transport the prisoners. Sounds like Auschwitz? The cars have shackles welded in; plastic coffins are stockpiled and ready for use.</p>
<p>What if enough people found out that the 9/11 &#8220;terrorist&#8221; attack was no terrorist attack at all, but a false-flag event carried out by the U.S. Government to serve as a pretext to invade Iraq and Afghanistan and to install the Surveillance State at home? And what if millions of people demanded that the real perpetrators, the real 9/11 mass murderers-in the White House, the CIA, the Pentagon, the judiciary-be brought to justice in a Nuremberg-style criminal court?</p>
<p>The FEMA camps are ready. To put the movement&#8217;s leaders away. To crush the dissent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What portion of this explanation is incorrect? Refusal to face up to the actions of DHS will not necessarily save you from selection for a place at a FEMA camp. The transition of Americans from thinking defenders of constitutional liberties into dumb down nationalists and servile obedient slaves, explained in the essay, <a href="http://www.batr.org/wrack/042813.html">From Viet Nam Defiance to Boston Surrender</a>, needs a response to a fundamental question. Will you allow forcible transport to a FEMA camp? Or will you gladly pack up your toothbrush and submit to &#8220;<a href="http://www.november.org/stayinfo/breaking2/Ferranti.html">Diesel Therapy</a>&#8221; and ride the bus to your new cell?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Corrosive incrementalism of totalitarian policies developed in an environment of gradual apathy, over the last half century. Dissenting opposition movements, persistently confrontational against the establishment became less organized and vocal. As a result, institutions of influence descended into deeper depths of moral corruption, as the agencies of bureaucratic dominance expanded their reach and scope of tyranny.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The prospects of declaring martial law, as well as, federal direction of coercive compliance and assimilation of local law enforcement assets, is the only logical purpose of creating militarized FEMA encampments. In a country, that maintains <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/033113.html">Private Prisons and the Enslavement Society</a>, it is one small step to eliminate any opposition by way of herding defiant resistors into secure concentration camps.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/change-hitler-obama-lenin-300.jpg" alt="change-hitler-obama-lenin-300.jpg" align="Left"/></p>
<p>Those who still say it could never happen in the United States, lack a historic perspective and current events understanding. Ever since the exploited <a href="http://batr.org/wrack/011104.html">ultimate excuse</a> of the <a href="http://batr.org/911/">911</a> false flag, the nation has suffered from acute delusional disorder syndrome. With the announcement that the <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/911-Museum-NYC-Ground-Zero-Dedication-Ceremony-WTC-Museum-259264311.html">9/11 Museum Opens to Families, First Responders With Emotional Dedication Ceremony</a>, you witness another psychological warfare opportunity to pave the way for the latest tactic of indoctrinating the public into accepting that domestic terrorists are the new focus of the Homeland Security mission.</p>
<p>Under both Bush and Obama, the authoritarians have built the greatest threat to America; namely, a permanent police state. Depending upon the FEMA district in which you reside, the presence of Federal concertina wire may vary. However, the <a href="http://www.rense.com/general58/fearthecomingtrain.htm">rail cars</a> are able to move human cargo in all directions and the trains will run on time. Check out the <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/find-the-fema-camp-nearest-you_062013">FEMA camp</a> closest to you.</p>
<p>With the adoption of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/tag/NDAA">National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)</a>, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/senators-demand-military-lock-american-citizens-battlefield-they-define-being">codifying indefinite military detention</a> without charge or trial into law, places at risk every American in the torture chamber of the Gitmo captivity culture. Before long, the next fabricated crisis offers the opportunity for Martial Law that translates into the order for the knock at your door. Will you accept DHS chains? Or will you die, a bona fide American hero and resist?</p>

			<h4>Origin of the Master Model</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/modern-slavery.jpg" alt="" />The master plan for world domination we see playing out today was first proposed to the US at the end of World War I. However, there were no takers. People were too war weary. However, when the plan was again proposed at the end of World War II, it was accepted. Consequently, World War II quietly transitioned into the secret “war” to set up what has become known as the “new world order” — an absolute dictatorship over the entire planet.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States set up the School of the Americas to train future dictators and terrorists who would be sent out into the world to destroy sovereign nations and place them under US domination by installing puppet governments obedient to the United States. Many conquests were made quietly using clever economic tricks <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>. However, leaders who refused to submit quietly would see their entire country reduced to rubble and the land rendered unlivable by uranium dust scattered by US bombs. The message was clear: Submit to the United States or face total destruction.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A social model based upon the assumption that cleverness and power automatically convey the right to take anything desired from those who are less adept and unable to resist is not a sustainable model for harmonious social interactions. However, this is the chosen model. The mantra for this model, “A man’s true worth is measured by the amount of other peoples’ happiness that he can <em>possess </em>and <em>destroy</em>” <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote1" name="fn1">[1]</a>, is essentially a call for a class war between the greedy elite and the innocent masses of the world who simply desire a peaceful existence.</p>
<h4>Acquisitions</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States looks at the rest of the world as a “resource”. If a country has something — oil, gold, minerals, etc. — that the US covets, it believes it has the right to take those things by whatever means necessary. In many cases the coveted resource is human slave labor. Let’s look at some representative examples:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/US_ThirdWorld/US_Guat.html" target="_blank">Guatemala: The Banana Wars</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With the cooperation of the dictator, United Fruit Company (US) owned almost half of the country and used the locals as slaves to harvest its Chiquita brand bananas. However, during the period from 1945-1954 new leaders made changes. They helped the poor and set up social security and health care. Then they took land away from United Fruit and gave it to the local people. United fruit complained to the CIA that its business interests were being interfered with by the “communist” government. Any government which shows kindness to the poor and weak is called communist by the US. The US attacked Guatemala — killed the elected leaders and many thousands of citizens — and established a puppet dictatorship which would obey the will of United Fruit. The people were returned to a state of slavery. The CIA trained death squads to make sure the people were crushed into submission.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Strip Mining in Africa <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote4" name="fn4">[4]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In Africa, the International Monetary Fund — a puppet of the US — destroys a country with strip mining. The original country was self sustaining. People were able to grow lots of food and hunt animals. However, once the land was ruined by US corporations, it was unusable to plant crops and the native animals died. The people had to buy food from other countries with money loaned to them by the IMF which they could never hope to repay. Therefore, a once free and self supporting people were made debt slaves of the IMF. Once all the natural resources have been stolen, the corporations will simply pack up and leave the indigenous people to starve and die.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Countries Used as Trash Dumps <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote5" name="fn5">[5]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Used computers and associated items are dumped in poor countries where starving barefoot children sift through the mess of hazardous waste and broken obsolete glass computer monitors hoping to find something they can sell to get enough money to stay alive another day. Property stickers show the waste is mainly from the US government and various US state governments.</p>
<h4>Corruption of Trusted Sources</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reporters and News Organizations</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The masses are conditioned to believe news they receive from establishment sources. In the earlier times, this assumption was often correct. It was considered so important by the founding fathers that freedom of the press was enshrined in the US constitution. However, times have changed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Walter Cronkite was known as the “trusted voice”. No one knew he was also the official announcer at the secret Bohemian Grove meetings. The leaders of the world’s news organizations also attend this event. That is why, even though the meetings began over one hundred years ago, until recently no one knew this group even existed. President George W. Bush may have set a new record for bribing journalists to allow their trusted name to be used as the author of material actually written by government propaganda experts. Apparently, everyone has a price and the government, of course, has no problem when it comes to money.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When Ronald Reagan reportedly ordered the death of investigative reporter Jessica Savitch <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote6" name="fn6">[6]</a>, the message to independent journalists was clear: Go against the official party line an you’re done!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, dedicated journalists face mysterious deaths and strange single car accidents but a few survive long enough to give us a glimpse of truths we would otherwise never know. They are true heroes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Churches</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are everywhere. Unfortunately, legitimate Spiritual teachers are not. People look at churches either as harmless or with some sort of conditioned hypnotic respect. Churches send out “missionaries”. However, the “mission” of these missionaries may not be so clear. If you wanted to infiltrate a foreign country, these people would be an ideal asset.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are not Spiritual centers. At best, all they want is your money. At worst, they are Satanic and you are in severe Spiritual danger if you come under their influence and control.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Catholic Church has been a trusted asset of the US intelligence community for quite some time. Significant information obtained by priests during confessions is routinely passed on to the government.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This agreement predates the internet by many years. Because the church has branches in almost every country, it has great potential for covert activities. For example, if you need to get an operative who is in danger out of a country, they can go to a Catholic church for “confession”. Once the door is closed, they can exit through a secret passage, be disguised in robes and spirited safely out of the country. Church secrecy is at least on a par with US secrecy. Also, the Catholic church and the US shadow government share the same Satanic value system and engage in child rape and ritual killings.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Doctors and the Medical Industry</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Medicine in the United States is an industry. It is no longer a profession. Its corporate model puts profit above all else. If some patients accidentally benefit they are the lucky ones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The medical community has a rigid hierarchical structure and effective mechanisms for enforcing secrecy. Essentially, its model closely resembles the military chain of command structure. This makes it a perfect partner for the government in the area of secret human experiments.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, when the government was doing radiation experiments on humans, a doctor or someone dressed as a doctor would just walk up to unsuspecting patients and inject them with radioactive material. They were then secretly followed for years to see what would happen. Eventually, some of those who survived were told the truth. Most people used in the MK Ultra and subsequent secret projects were never notified.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Hospitals are set up to protect themselves. Staff may appear to be dedicated, smiling people who truly care about you. However, they are basically prostitutes who are being nice because you are worth money to them. When they make mistakes they have a “loss prevention” department staffed by clever lawyers who are trained to protect the financial interests of the hospital by denying everything and fabricating believable coverups. They are trained to do whatever is necessary. The staff will all agree to support whatever lies are needed. They know their job and their financial future depends upon maintaining strict secrecy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The only people who receive legitimate medical care are the select elite cleared to access<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>. These people always get excellent care because the doctors work for the shadow government and mistakes on their part are simply not tolerated.</p>
<h4>Infiltrations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Countries which have the resources to sustain an intelligence community generally try to get operatives (spies) into other countries so they can directly observe activities. When real people gather intelligence, this is called <em>human intelligence </em>or HUMINT. The US, of course, does this too. However, you may not be aware of the extent to which the US also infiltrates itself. The central government really does not trust anyone.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Essentially all local police departments, state offices and state governors have a covert federal agent working close by pretending to be just another employee. Also, every US neighborhood has an informer who reports to the federal government. Large corporations, which tend to behave like “mini governments”, need to be infiltrated and kept under observation. Colleges and universities are also monitored.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here is how this spy network operates: The NSA likes to recruit young kids right out of college. When they are hired and sworn to secrecy they still do not know what their assignment will be. They must agree to do this assignment without first being told what it is.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Some agents, like John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>, are assigned to work in other countries. However, others are assigned to work inside the US. Their assignment could be to go to some state and apply to join the local police department. They would pretend to be just a regular person looking for a job. They would take the necessary training and spend their life as a local policeman so they could directly observe other local police from the inside and report to the NSA. Since they are actually an employee of the NSA, presumably they get to keep both salaries and, eventually, both retirements. All significant local police forces in the US are infiltrated this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Additionally, some agents will be assigned to get a job on the state governor’s staff as well as in major local state agencies. A CIA or NSA agent is always on the staff at major colleges and universities. The same goes for major corporations.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Senior level agents are allowed to have special TV receivers in their homes linked to the secret government TV network. This way everyone stays on the same page. The channels on this network actually broadcast the truth. TV channels available to ordinary people contain only government approved propaganda mixed with “bread and circuses” presentations to make sure the <em>sheeple </em>stay asleep and content.</p>
<h4>Fronts</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US government is involved in illegal activities internationally and domestically. If it performed these activities overtly in the name of the United States, there would be serious consequences under both international and local laws. To avoid this situation, the US government operates thousands of “front organizations” which appear to be private but are actually shadow operatives of the US.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a> explained that he was recruited, hired and trained by the NSA. He was an NSA agent. However, for his cover as an <em>economic hit man</em>, he “officially” worked for a “private” company called Charles T. Main. This company was a government front to shield the US because the activities the NSA trained Perkins to do were illegal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is standard operating procedure for the US as well as other countries and many corporations. It shields them from legal recourse by providing deniability for the crimes they actually direct and commit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Generally, when the US wants to influence other sovereign countries, it creates harmless looking NGO’s which appear to be independent but are actually fronts for covert activities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Domestically, colleges and universities — especially those with associated medical schools and hospitals — are great places to conceal a variety of covert projects such as the MK Ultra series of human experiments which, reportedly, continue today using new cover names. The US also likes to create non-profit corporations which exist only to provide classified services to the United States. A good example would be the Institutes for Defense Analysis (IDA). The US, reportedly, is its only client.</p>
<h4>Programming</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Mass media “programming” is actually programming you. It has developed into a subtle form of mind control. Before radio and television, special interests recognized that motion pictures could be used to alter public opinion in their favor. Perhaps, for example, you wanted to attack labor unions. When radio and later television came along providing access to national and international audiences, the temptation to exploit these technologies became irresistible. Originally, the US government recognized this and set up fairness rules to prevent monopolies from taking over the broadcast media and blocking opposing viewpoints. All this ended, unfortunately, when Ronald Regan canceled all the fairness regulations. Today, a handful of powerful corporations own and control essentially all content delivered by radio and television.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Television is the main vehicle for mass indoctrination. It is said that people watching TV actually fall into a light hypnotic trance. The “entertainment” you see on TV does not “just happen to be there”. It is very carefully planned and timed to attract and influence targeted audiences. It is said that if some event were to somehow shut down all television broadcasts the government would experience a severe crisis because it would lose control over the minds of the masses.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">TV creates sort of a “hive mind” among the masses and keeps everyone coordinated and tuned into the official party line. Without this, people would have no choice but to start thinking for themselves and forming independent opinions. Clearly, this would be a disaster.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The radio broadcast of “War of the Worlds” and the later movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still” are said to be CIA psychological experiments to judge how the general public would react to some type of ET contact.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, broadcasting is not just a one way event. Because people react to events and use social media to express these reactions, the effect of specific propaganda can be analyzed in real time. Since the government now intercepts all electronic communications, it is able to see general opinions and then tweak algorithms to maximize the desired effect of propaganda. This ability makes TV a two-way communications system although most people, of course, do not realize this and have no concept of the level of sophistication these technologies have reached.</p>
<h4>Information Theory</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Information Theory is the name of a relatively new branch of science which became popular in the 1960′s. It covers a broad range of technologies. Basically, it is the science of the flow of information and how that flow can be selectively controlled so that information flows only in desired pathways. As you may have already guessed, governments love this sort of stuff.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>ECM</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">ECM stands for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">El</span>ectronic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co</span>unter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span>asures. In general, these are techniques to disable other electronic devices. Basically, it is electronic warfare. When the secret service is active in an area, for example, they will selectively jam all radio frequencies except for the specific frequencies they are using so that no one else can communicate.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">World leaders, who are generally terrified of “threats” materializing from practically anywhere, like to travel with ECM generators running just in case “someone” from “somewhere” was trying to target them for “some reason”. Basically, they are paranoid whack jobs.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People familiar with aviation tell the story of how Tony Blair, while traveling to or near a commercial airport, reportedly caused a commercial jet to crash because all the ECM garbage he was transmitting jammed the plane’s navigation system. Of course, the British government would never admit this.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secure Communication With Submarines</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7754" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-1.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="315" />Since submarines were invented, communicating with them has been a problem because conventional radio waves will not travel underwater. Therefore, early submarines had to get close enough to the surface to put up some kind of antenna in the air to send or receive radio messages. Obviously, this could pose a problem if you did not wish to be discovered and located. After all, the motivation to create submarines in the first place was the feeling that they would be able to move about the planet secretly. However, newer technologies now make this impossible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To solve the problem of reliable secure communication without the need to surface, scientists learned that sea water was essentially transparent to a special type of Argon laser. To set up the current communications network, it was decided to use several satellites with each satellite sending only part of an encrypted communication signal. The complete signal could only be received at a specific point underwater where all the laser beams intersected. Intercepting only one or two beams would prove useless. This communications system is considered to be impossible to intercept.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Quantum Entanglement</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Returning to the submarine issue for a moment, before modern communications were perfected, there was a search for some reliable method to send a signal to a submerged submarine that could not be detected. This was considered necessary in a war situation to secretly transmit an attack command. What they originally did was to locate a couple of people who could communicate telepathically. One would be at the command base and the other on the submarine. Doing a bit more research, it was determined that this type of communication is instantaneous and somehow operated outside of time. Radio waves travel at the speed of light.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Quantum entanglement is a process which uses technology to send and receive signals outside of space-time. Now, why would you possibly want to do this? Well, if you had a base or a colony on a planet in some other solar system light years away, you would not want to wait years for messages to be received. Following this thread — and adding some basic common sense — why would you want to dedicate resources to search for habitable planets in distant solar systems when you had already “proven” it would be impossible to ever get there? Could it just be that someone is not coming clean with whole story?</p>
<h4>The Separation Barrier</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a model of the separation barrier which insulates the ruling class from the slave class. It is essentially “intellectual apartheid”. The question is, why is it there. It takes considerable effort, money and manpower to maintain this artificial barrier. What is the reasoning behind not having a level playing field for everyone? Why does this idea absolutely terrify the elite? What are they afraid of?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Pirate Story</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a summary of a story told years ago on a radio broadcast most likely by Paul Harvey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinary people were afraid. The Earth was flat so they dare not venture far from home. Periodically, a pirate ship would come. They did not know how it got there or from where it came. It brought treasures they had never seen. The Chief Pirate would encourage the young men to study and specialize in specific skills. He wanted them to become educated but only in one narrow area. The Chief Pirate knew the world was not flat and how to navigate to other lands. However, this knowledge was never discussed. This “top secret” knowledge or the “big picture of the known world” would only be given to the Chief Pirate’s son who would inherit his title and someday become the Chief Pirate.</p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">This story is about the origin of the concept we call <em>compartmentalization</em> — the process of controlling the slave masses by only allowing them to know specific bits of the truth while the leaders are allowed to know total truth.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Leaders can only maintain their status if there are slaves. Otherwise, everyone would be equal and operate on a level playing field. This means “leaders” would have to pull their own weight like everyone else. Clearly, this would be intolerable. Leaders love beautiful and exotic things but don’t want to do the work needed to create these things. They probably could not even plant a garden much less build the various “ivory towers” where they like to live surrounded by servants. If left on their own they would very likely starve. This is why it is so important to create and maintain the complex separation barrier.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Why don’t people who live above the separation barrier ever “come down” and talk to the people below the barrier? Well, other than the obvious fact that they would likely be killed or jailed for espionage or treason, there is another, simpler, reason.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Would you like to spend your days sitting in an open field with kindergarten kids looking for four leaf clovers? Probably not. You have progressed beyond that. The slaves below the separation barrier cannot even imagine the world of those who live above the barrier. In fact, the elite do not even consider the slaves human. They call them “disposable biological units”. The United Nations prefers the slang term “the herd”. Slaves can be easily bred in quantities needed and programmed to do desired tasks. Then, they can be easily disposed of when no longer useful. That’s how they look at you. So, why would they want to make friends with you?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Mars Example</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is an interesting event playing out today that you may have noticed. This concerns the recruitment and selection of people to be sent to Mars. There are simulation projects where volunteers are locked away to imitate the long voyage to Mars. They are being told that this is a one way trip and they can never hope to return to Earth.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What you are witnessing is the selection process for the “seed people” who will be used to breed the future slave class on Mars. In a situation similar to the period when most believed the Earth was flat and you would fall off if you tried to go to sea, these people are convinced that the only way to get to mars is to ride a rocket on a perilous journey taking years. Because they truly believe this, when they get to Mars, they will teach this crap to their kids along with other misconceptions like it is impossible to go faster than the speed of light and other associated obsolete scientific principles. They will have no<br />
desire to ever return to Earth or go anywhere else because they truly believe it is not possible. They will be contented slaves.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course the truth is that there are already secret colonies on Mars. It is not that hard to get there using antigravity and other secret propulsion methods and it is quite likely possible to simply walk through some kind of wormhole device and come out on Mars.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, the slaves will never know this. Just as it is done on Earth, there will be an artificial separation barrier. The insiders will know the truth and will be physically hidden from the slaves. There will be secret police and other methods — the same as are used on Earth — to make sure no slave ever escapes from the “information prison”. Business as usual will continue.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reinforcement of Ignorance</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Governments and their oligarchs love to keep their subjects in a cloud of ignorance. Back in the days when people believed the Earth was flat, the inner circle ruling class knew it was round. Maintaining the deception was convenient because it kept the slaves from developing any desire to travel far from home.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Nothing has changed all that much today. Consider, for example, all the fuss over the missing MH370 plane. You are being played for a sucker. It is impossible for that plane to have “disappeared”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US DoD spy satellite system reportedly consists of ten constellations of satellites. Each constellation has over seven thousand satellites. They see and record everything that happens on this planet. The floor of the oceans can be seen just as clearly as the land areas. The resolution of the system is better than one square millimeter. Also, everything is recorded so you can go back in time and play past images.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7756" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-2.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="141" />This is a picture of a common electric lamp. Take this lamp and throw it in the ocean — any ocean anywhere on this planet. The spy satellite system will locate it, give you the coordinates and give you a photo at least as good as the one above. That is the capability of the system. So, clearly, it is impossible not to know the location of something as large as a Boeing 777 plane. All the TV publicity is a choreographed play. You are being scammed and you need to wake up and realize this fact.</p>
<h4>Murders and Assassinations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">To ensure a strong empire, dissent must be crushed. The United States trains assassins and carries out both domestic and foreign murders and assassinations on a regular basis. You may be familiar with the classic movie scenes where a black limousine with tinted windows drives by a target with thugs shooting machine guns. Although this would accomplish the task, it is a bit too obvious in a country that advertises itself to be a free, civilized democracy. Someone might catch on and begin to doubt the party line. Consequently, these things must be done quietly.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Inside the US, murders are reportedly carried out by a group known as “FBI Division Five”. Other agencies likely have the responsibility for foreign assassinations. However, the basic techniques used would be similar.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Typically, an agent would wake up every day and connect to the top secret internet to see who he was assigned to kill that day. There would be several options. If it was important to eliminate the target immediately, a fast acting chemical agent would be selected which, for example, would cause the target to die within a few hours of a “natural” heart attack.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, if time was not critical and the government just wanted the target out of the way, you might want to select one of the cancer causing agents such as those likely used to eliminate Hugo Chavez and Senator Ted Kennedy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is also a third possibility. This involves character assassination instead of actual murder. Consider, for example, a person who has gained a lot of public recognition talking about, say, free energy. If you simply kill the person, there could be blowback and talk that he was silenced by the government. In such cases, it is easier to use a chemical agent designed not to kill but, rather, to cause states of mental confusion resulting in obviously strange behavior. This would be coordinated with the government controlled mainstream press to make sure everyone became convinced the person was a nut and would therefore ignore anything said without regard to the truth or validity of the message.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once the appropriate chemical has been selected, you need to load it into the secret delivery system and locate your target. To find your target you will connect to the top secret internet and pinpoint the location of the target through their cell phone. You can also activate all the cameras and microphones in electronic gadgets connected to the internet associated with the target in case you wish to look around the target’s home and hear in real time what is taking place.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, this will not help you locate the target when it is time to actually do the hit. So, you need to get the top secret profile data which will show any predictable habits of the target. Everyone is constantly tracked through their cell phones and profiles are logged and stored. In this case, the profile shows that the target has a favorite restaurant and goes there for lunch every day around 11:30. Now, you know exactly what to do. You go to the restaurant, hang out until you see your target, and get in line behind the target. Now, all you need to do is slightly bump into the target to deliver the chemical. Generally, the targets never even notice.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This mission is now complete. If it is early enough, you can check back in to the top secret system to see who you are supposed to kill next. Just another day. Just a routine job.</p>
<h4>Money</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>Money</em> is an imaginary force. It is used to motivate and control slaves. Real forces effect all life forms. However, only people respond to money. The only reason they do is because they have been artificially programmed to do so.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money can be created in unlimited quantities by those adept in the use of this force. The physical world is finite, however the world of imagination is not. There is no limit to the quantity of money that can be imagined into existence. Money can also be imagined out of existence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Let’s assume that one day the entire financial system simply disappeared. If you lived in a rural area and had a nice veggie garden, some friendly chickens, collection facilities for rain water and a few photocells for electricity, you would not notice this. The veggies would continue to grow. Rain would periodically fall. The chickens would lay eggs as usual. The sun would continue to shine. However, if you lived in a city environment, you would be devastated.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Before money, people lived in small hunter-gatherer groups. The concept of ownership did not exist. People worked and survived as a group. Men and women were equal. Everyone contributed to the community. Resources were shared equally. The concept of “mine” and “yours” did not exist. Women generally became pregnant only once about every three years although there was no birth control. Later, when the concept of money entered the consciousness, women were seen as having less value because men were paid for work but women were not paid to raise and care for kids. Society has changed, however, the downgraded status of women has not.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money systems have always been manipulated by clever people. When gold was used as money, people learned they could dilute pure gold with silver or maybe even lead to come up with something that looked like pure gold and had the correct weight but was a fraud. A king suspected he was being scammed but had no way to prove it. He called on the great minds of the time for help. This led to what is known as the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://faculty.weber.edu/ewalker/Chem2990/Chem%202990%20Specific%20Gravity%20Readings.pdf" target="_blank">Archimedes’ principle</a> which is better known today as “specific gravity”. This principle made it possible to compare a sample known to be pure gold to a questionable sample and prove the unknown sample was not pure gold. Likely, some clever crook lost his head once this test became known.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is a general belief that gold is the ultimate reference for all money. However, secrets concerning the exact quantity of gold make this a perilous assumption. Reportedly, the United States stole a tremendous quantity of physical gold from Japan towards the end of World War II. This gold exists off the books. To make matters worse, Japan was not all that concerned. Japan had been using gold bars as ballast on its ships because they were compact and heavy. They thought nothing of throwing the bars overboard as necessary. Japan used platinum as a money reference and the US never got that. This should make one rethink all the hype about the value of gold. It may be a lot more plentiful than we have been led to believe. Also, the secret off the books stashes of gold would allow its relative value to be manipulated at will just like other commodity markets.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Financial Axis of Evil <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote3" name="fn3">[3]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7755" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-3.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="231" />This is the model of the financial axis of evil which rules this planet. It consists of three main branches as shown above. Collectively, they are known as “The Empire of the City”. Briefly, here is how this system operates:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The London financial district is in London, Washington D.C. is in the United States and the Vatican is in Italy. However, these three places are not part of the countries where they exist. They are independent “city states” and have their own laws and constitution. They are, effectively, “mini countries” inside of other countries and fly their own flags. The city state of London is a private corporation and pays no taxes to actual London or to Britain. The city state of London is the master power center and is controlled by the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm" target="_blank">Rothschild family</a> which considers itself to be the legal owner of this planet. The Vatican is the largest private land owner in the world and the first true multinational corporation with installations (churches) and secret agents (The Knights of Malta) everywhere. They control through the power of fear of the unknown and practice black magic. Washington D.C. relies upon brute military force. All three closely cooperate combining their specialties of financial trickery, witchcraft and military might. Of course, all three worship Satan as their Master.</p>
<h4>Slavery</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Slavery is alive and well throughout the world. The US constitution prohibits slavery, however, most americans live in slave-like conditions.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is said that it will take the average college student until age fifty to pay back their student loan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery addressed the concept of physically owning another person. However, it did not address the issue of holding another person in bondage as a debt slave. It also did not consider the concept of private for profit prisons who force inmates to work as slaves. These systems exist today and are perfectly legal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Actually, a recent report from prestigious Princeton University has reclassified the US government as an oligarchy — a country run by and for the rich elite. Former US President Carter has stated that the United States “no longer has a functioning democracy”. So much for the Founding Father’s dream. Speaking of dreams, check out the free you tube video titled “The American Dream”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Other forms of slavery are illegal but still flourish. Sex slaves are always in demand. Traffickers are sometimes caught but you need to realize that your leaders use sex slaves and also routinely abuse young girls and boys. Sometimes they are also killed during occult rituals. No one ever talks about this and these people are never punished. This has been the normal way of life for Satan worshipers for many years and nothing has changed or is likely to ever change in the future. Stanley Kubrick’s last movie, <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>, covers this subject. Some believe this intense dramatization of how the elite really live may have cost him his life.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People still have some rights left in the United States but other countries are a different story. Qatar is doing construction for the World Cup. The event is not scheduled until the year 2022, however they have <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/2022-world-cup-qatar-accused-3303458" target="_blank">already killed 1200 slaves</a> <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote7" name="fn7">[7]</a> by working them to death. People are lured from poor countries with the promise of jobs and money. When they arrive, their passports are confiscated and they are forced to work until they literally drop dead. If the World Cup is actually held in Qatar in 2022, there will be glamorous TV coverage and no one will remember or care about all the dead slaves. The show must go on.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Qatar, incidentally, sponsors Al Jazeera TV network.</p>
<h4>Adaptation Techniques</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The status quo of today will never change because the people who created it will never die. Because of <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>, when men like Henry Kissinger, who heads the Bilderberg Group’s steering committee, get too feeble to function, they will simply go to one of the secret locations and use the temporal reversal device to regress back to about twenty years old. Their memories will be unaffected. Then they will get new identities and continue on. This process can be repeated indefinitely.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Because you can never change the status quo, your best hope for a lifetime of reasonable quality is to find clever ways to live in this world with as much independence as possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">One method of adaptation is autonomous and semi-autonomous communities. If the community is registered as a religious institution it is automatically shielded from most government interference by the US constitution. It pays no taxes and can pretty much write its own rules by simply calling whatever it wants to do “religious doctrine”. Many small semi-autonomous groups exist where people who share a common set of values find ways to quietly live out their lives pretty much on their own terms. The government does not seem interested in bothering these smaller groups as long as they live peacefully and are not doing anything that the government perceives to be a threat.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Amish people are a good example of an autonomous group. You would probably not want to live as they do, however, before you completely dismiss them, you may want to look at some definite advantages in their chosen lifestyle.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Remember, these are the people who reject technology. They just might have made the correct choice. Technology, at first, seemed like a good idea. However, now that people are addicted to technology they are also enslaved by technology. Everything they do is monitored and recorded by the government. Privacy no longer exists. It did not have to be this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Technology, in itself, is not evil. However, it can be quite evil if you live under a government run by sociopathic control freaks which, unfortunately, you do. In the Amish world, electronic surveillance does not exist because electronic devices do not exist. The constant propaganda from TV has no effect on people who do not have TV. A horse does not report its position to a GPS satellite and is not controlled by a computer.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Also, the people are generally healthy and do not suffer from many diseases common to the mainstream population. They are not being poisoned by fluorinated water or additives found in processed food because they don’t use these things. Also, they get lots of physical exercise.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Without totally withdrawing from the world, there are some positive steps you can take. By now you know never to drink fluorinated water or use any personal product containing fluoride such as many brands of toothpaste. To minimize harmful food additives, look for Kosher food which is marked with either the encircled “K” or “U” (Ultra Kosher). These foods have less or no harmful additives. The Jewish community is very protective of its people and the Mossad is widely considered to be the best intelligence service in the world. Therefore, they would have the inside scoop on everything including food and do not want to see their people harmed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Whatever you decide to do, you definitely do not want to be part of so called mainstream society. These people are doomed. They are sheep (<em>sheeple</em>) slowly walking to the slaughter house. Don’t go there!</p>

			<p style="color: #000000;"><img src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Panem_map.jpg" alt="" />One of the most popular films of 2012 was <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008602KQI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B008602KQI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=ZWKIYED6NU3XVRTV" target="_blank"><em><strong>The Hunger Games</strong></em></a> which portrayed a post-apocalyptic nation called Panem in which a super-rich, super-pampered, super-callous ‘elite’ lived in high-tech luxury while the rest of the population daily battled to survive in abject poverty locked away behind prison fences in intensively-populated ‘people zones’. Panem comes from the Latin phrase <em>‘panem et circenses’</em> or ‘bread and circuses’ — a term derived from Rome and meaning to give the people diversions and distractions to hide what is being done to them. Exactly what is happening today.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Totalitarian Tiptoes to just such a world are happening all around us, although most people can’t see this because they don’t connect the dots. People tend to live in their own ‘little world’ and focus on only a few subjects and interests. This gives them a distorted view of what is happening because they are so busy concentrating on the strands that they cannot see the tapestry. The world of <em>The Hunger Games</em> is already well on the way to fruition unless humanity has a fundamental reassessment of reality.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The foundations, structure and ‘must haves’ of a Hunger Games society are detailed in a plan being imposed through the United Nations called <strong>Agenda 21</strong> which encompasses two related themes of ‘sustainable development’ and ‘biodiversity’. Sustainable development — as in don’t use more than can be replaced — sounds sensible enough at first until you realize what this and biodiversity really mean in the context of the conspiracy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/02/11/city-ordinance-nightmare-texas-homeowner-facing-2600-fines-weeds/" target="_blank">Agenda 21</a> was established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, in 1992, hosted by <strong>Maurice Strong</strong>, a Canadian oil and business billionaire and long-time front man for the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/01/23/who-really-controls-the-world/" target="_blank"><strong>Rothschilds</strong></a> and <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/05/the-shady-past-of-the-rockefeller-family-its-haunting-effect-on-the-world/" target="_blank"><strong>Rockefellers</strong></a>. Strong has been a leader of their exploit-the-environment-to-scam-the-people programme which is now in full flow. Strong is a member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>, the environmental Hidden Hand in the <strong>Round Table</strong> network that includes the <strong>Bilderberg Group</strong>, <strong>Trilateral Commission</strong> and <strong>Council on Foreign Relations</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Strong said in support of Agenda 21:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘Isn’t the only hope for this planet that the industrialised civilization collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?’</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a man who became mega-rich through the oil industry. He now lives in billionaire luxury in China where carbon-emitting industry is booming and he is a director of the Chicago Climate Exchange (largest shareholder, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>), which is <em>‘the world’s first and North America’s only legally-binding greenhouse-gas emission registry reduction-system for emission sources and offset projects in North America and Brazil’</em>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Exchange was established with funding from the Joyce Foundation where <strong>Barack Obama</strong> was once a director. Strong and <strong>Al Gore</strong> make money through the Carbon Exchange and other means from the lies they promote about climate change and the solutions they propose. Kate Johnston wrote on the <em>Globalresearch.ca</em>website:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘The same men that sold us the myth of man-made global warming are the same men that sold us the “solution” of a Carbon Tax and Emissions Trading Scheme and now they’re profiting off their lucrative investments which are based on lies.’</em> (See <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://julianwebsdale.tumblr.com/post/72890748737/the-climate-change-hoax">“The Climate Change Hoax”</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">Strong fled to China in 2006 after being accused of corruption with respect to the UN oil for food program.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Climate change propaganda is a No-Problem-Reaction-Solution technique to justify Agenda 21 and its stable-mate the <strong>Biodiversity Treaty</strong>. This is an internationally-binding document involving nearly 200 countries. The United States signed the treaty, but it was not ratified by the Senate after people like ecologist and ecosystem scientist Dr. Michael Coffman exposed its true consequences and implications. He said that he realized during the 1980s and 1990s that the plan was to use the excuse of protecting the environment to confiscate half the land of the United States.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Similar plans exist for every other country. America may not have ratified the treaty, but it is being implemented by the day. Agenda 21 demands the central global control of all land; all private property; all water sources and distribution; all other resources which includes people in its definition; all energy supplies and distribution and all food production and distribution.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Agenda 21 is called <em>‘the agenda for the 21st century’</em> and that refers to global fascism / communism. This is a summary of what Agenda 21 / Sustainable Development / Biodiversity is seeking to impose:</p>
<ul>
<li class="perle">An end to national sovereignty</li>
<li class="perle">State planning and management of all land resources, ecosystems, deserts, forests, mountains, oceans and fresh water; agriculture; rural development; biotechnology; and ensuring ‘equity’ (equal slavery)</li>
<li class="perle">The State to ‘define the role’ of business and financial resources</li>
<li class="perle">Abolition of private property (it’s not ‘sustainable’)</li>
<li class="perle">‘Restructuring’ the family unit</li>
<li class="perle">Children raised by the State</li>
<li class="perle">People told what their job will be</li>
<li class="perle">Major restrictions on movement</li>
<li class="perle">Creation of ‘human settlement zones’</li>
<li class="perle">Mass resettlement as people are forced to vacate land where they currently live</li>
<li class="perle">Dumbing down education (achieved)</li>
<li class="perle">Mass global depopulation in pursuit of all the above</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">This horrific plan is being coordinated through the United Nations, the stalking horse for world dictatorship, via a non-governmental network once called the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives ICLEI), and now known as Local Governments for Sustainability although still using the shortened name ICLEI. The United Nations is now opening ‘embassies’ around the world called ‘UN Houses’ under the guise of raising awareness of UN activities, but not the activities that people really need to know about. They have opened one in Hunter Square, Edinburgh, Scotland, for example.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) and other organisations are integrating the plan into every village, town, city and region and it is already becoming widespread across the world. The organisational infrastructure of Agenda 21 is already fantastic and involves government agencies, non-governmental organisations (<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/03/06/education-elite-mono-minding-global-plans-children/" target="_blank">NGOs</a>), think-tanks, trusts, foundations, ‘training’ (mind control) operations and ‘initiatives’ which have been building the infrastructure for what they call ‘the post-industrial, post-democratic’ society while the public go about their daily business oblivious of the prison being built all around them by the hour.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Harvey Ruvin</strong>, a vice-chairman of ICLEI, was asked how Agenda 21 would affect liberties with regard to the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, private property and freedom of speech. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>‘Individual rights must take a back-seat to the collective.’</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">The arrogance of these people is breathtaking. The extraordinary network supporting ICLEI and Agenda 21 includes the Rockefeller-sponsored America 2050; United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG); Metropolis; World Economic Forum; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction; World Bank; <strong>Clinton</strong> Climate Initiative; Climate Group (<strong>Tony Blair</strong>); World Conservation Union (IUCN); Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership; Global Footprint Network; Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership; Global Footprint Network; International Centre for Sustainable Cities; Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative and the Stakeholder Forum. These and so many others are working to the same end — Agenda 21 and total human enslavement worldwide, although most of those involved will have no idea that they are building a global prison for themselves and their families.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Another of these front organisations is the World Business Council for Sustainable Development which includes the hideously anti-people <strong>Monsanto</strong>. Destroying food-growing land, contaminating the countryside with toxins and replacing proper food with deadly and soil-destroying genetically-modified organisms is Monsanto’s contribution to ‘sustainability’. Agenda 21 is operating in more than 600 towns, cities and counties in the United States and expanding by the day.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A member of the Agenda 21 committees in Santa Cruz, California, in the mid-1990s said that the proposals he heard were so crazy that he laughed at them because they could never happen. These included that ‘Mother Earth’s surface was not to be scratched’; humans should be concentrated in settlement zones; education should focus on the environment as a central organising principle and all aspects of life covered by Agenda 21, but all of these crazy plans are now being introduced. It’s all happy, feely, smiling faces and how we care, when the truth is that Agenda 21 is a vicious, brutal, heartless strategy to impose a global <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/07/03/whistleblower-edward-snowden-releases-statement-from-moscow-still-seeking-asylum/" target="_blank">Orwellian state</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Agenda 21 manipulators either create or hijack some local organisation or other, many of them in locations with large populations, and they have their (controlled) leadership to agree the Agenda 21 blueprint for their community together with any uninformed, unwitting idiots who can be sold a human nightmare as saving the planet. This allows them to claim that decisions were made after ‘public participation’ when that would have been the last thing they wanted, and 99 percent of the ‘community’ has never heard of Agenda 21 let alone had their say on it. They want <em>no</em> democracy which is why these people talk privately, sometimes even publicly, about the post-democratic, post-industrial society.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">They want to control every man, woman and child on the planet — everyone and everywhere and every resource, water source and piece of land. To do this they need a global structure of fascist control that goes right down into every local community with the jackboots at local level enforcing the will of the global centre. This is why there is so much emphasis on local authorities and town and city authorities in Agenda 21.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is a ‘training organisation’ called <strong>Common Purpose</strong> (common purpose, common consensus, everyone the same) which has been paid very large amounts of money by governments and local authorities, police forces and other institutions of state to ‘train the leaders’ of the post-democratic, post-industrial society. Common Purpose was heavily represented in the Leveson ‘inquiry’ leading to new media laws in Britain. It is not a training programme; it is a <em>programming</em> programme and turns out unquestioning zombie administrators who serve the god of Agenda 21 and the associated European Union. The theme of ‘common’ also applies to the ever greater standardisation of laws and regulations and constant reference to ‘international law’. This is the unfolding global dictatorship of Agenda 21. What do you need to be a global dictator? Laws that everyone on the planet must obey — <em>international law and the standardisation of global regulation</em>.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">You can see <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008602KQI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B008602KQI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=ZWKIYED6NU3XVRTV" target="_blank"><em><strong>The Hunger Games</strong></em></a> connection when you look at the official Biodiversity wish-for map of the United States in Figure 1. The red areas are designated for no human use and most of the rest of America is confiscated for little and highly-regulated use. The mass of the population would be concentrated in high-rise, densely-packed ‘human settlement zones’ and denied access to something like 80 percent of present day America. It is without question the world of <em>The Hunger Games</em> with a globally-enforced top-down hierarchy that has a world government using its world army and police force to impose its will at regional and local levels (sectors). The Rockefeller-funded America 2050 has produced a map of the new United States divided into eleven ‘megaregions’ and includes parts of Canada (Figure 2). Seattle, Portland and Vancouver, British Columbia, become the megaregion known as ‘Cascadia’ and this regional system comes under the collective name of ‘megalopolis’ which is Greek for large city or great city. America, Canada and Mexico are due to merge to form the North American Union in line with the European Union blueprint.</p>

<em>Figure 2: The Rockefeller-funded America 2050 map of America and Canada divided into megaregions.</em></p>
</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">The <strong>European Union is planned to be broken up into regions</strong> and the same structure is in development all over the world. The map of the new Europe has regions from different countries linked up with regions in other countries to end any vestige of national sovereignty or even national existence (Figure 3). This is a global plan with its fierce central control hidden behind its lower elements such as the European Union and local government. What is planned would clearly require a fantastic reduction of the global population and this is indeed what Agenda 21 / Sustainable Development / Biodiversity demand.</p>

<p>The ultimate and final goal of evil is to obscure and destroy our very conception of evil itself, to change the inherent moral fiber of all humanity until people can no longer recognize what is right and what is wrong. Evil is not a wisp of theological myth or a simplistic explanation for the aberrant behaviors of the criminal underbelly; rather, it is a tangible and ever present force in our world. It exists in each and every one of us. All men do battle with this force for the entirety of our lives in the hope that when we leave this Earth, we will leave it better and not worse.</p>
<p>When evil manifests among organized groups of people in the halls of power, power by itself is not always considered the greatest prize. The true prize is to mold society until it reflects the psychopathy that rots at the core of their being. That is to say, the elites, the oligarchy, the mad philosopher kings want to make us just like they are: proudly soulless. Only then can they rule, because only then will they be totally unopposed.</p>
<p>The problem is humanity is not only hardwired with a dark side; we are also hardwired with a conscience — at least, most of us are.</p>
<p>The vast studies of psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung prove an in-depth and intricate inborn set of principles common to every person, regardless of time or place of birth and regardless of environmental circumstances. In some circles we refer to this as “natural law.” All people are born with a shared moral compass that is often expressed in various religious works throughout the ages. It is a universal voice, or guide, that we can choose to listen to or to ignore. Organized psychopaths have struggled with the existence of this inborn compass for centuries.</p>
<p>They have tried using force and fear. They have tried abusing our natural inclinations toward family and tribalism. They have tried corrupting the very religious institutions that are supposed to reinforce our consciences and teach us nobility. They have tried psychotropic substances and medications to paralyze our emotional center and make us malleable. They have tried everything, and they have failed so far. How do I know they have failed? Because you are able to read this article today.</p>
<p>Two methods remain prominent in the arsenal of elites.</p>
<p><strong>Convince Good People To Do Evil In The Name Of ‘Good’</strong></p>
<p>This strategy is still effective, depending on the scenario encountered. Elitists are very fond of presenting mind games to the public (in TV, cinema, books, etc.), which I call “no-win scenarios.” These games are hypothetical dilemmas that require the participant or viewer to make a forced choice with only two options: The participant can strictly follow his conscience, which usually means assured destruction for himself and others; or he can bend or break the rules of conscience in order to save lives and achieve a “greater good.”</p>
<p>Watch the propaganda tsunami in the show “24,” for example, and tally how many times the hero is faced with a no-win scenario. Then tally how many times he ignores his moral imperative in order to succeed. The message being sent is clear: Solid morality is not logical. Morality is a luxury for those who do not have to concern themselves with immediate survival. In other words, the world needs bad men to fight other bad men.</p>
<p>Of course, real life is not television; and there has never been nor will there ever be a legitimate example of a no-win scenario. There are no dilemmas that require good people to knowingly sacrifice conscience or destroy innocent lives in order to succeed. There are no dilemmas with only two available solutions. All social dilemmas are fluid, which means that solutions are shifting, but infinite. Just because you cannot see the way out does not mean the way out does not exist. To fight monsters, we do not need to become monsters. Survival is meaningless unless we can prove ourselves worthy of life. This does not mean one should not fight back against evil. On the contrary, one should always fight back. But if we fight without a code of principles and honor, then we will have lost before the battle begins.</p>
<p><strong>Convince Good People That There Is No Such Thing As ‘Evil’ People</strong></p>
<p>Any action, no matter how horrifying, can be rationalized by the intellectual mind or the mathematical mind. This is why we are born with an emotional and empathic side to our natures. Those who embrace evil often seek to soften their image through the use of cold rationalization. They appeal to our desire to feel logically responsible and to boost our intelligent self-image.</p>
<p>Some people might argue that the machinations of evil are self-evident, and that philosophical examinations such as this are unnecessary.  They would say that there is no need to reassert that the works of psychopathy and elitism are fundamentally destructive, but they would be wrong.  I was recently sifting through some mainstream articles when I came across this jewel entitled <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10788449/Why-psychopaths-are-more-successful.html" target="_blank">“Why Psychopaths Are More Successful.”</a></p>
<p>The article summarizes the theories behind a new “science self-help book” entitled <em>The Good Psychopath’s Guide To Success</em>. Co-author and Oxford psychology professor, Kevin Dutton, states that he “wanted to debunk the myth that all psychopaths are bad.” He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’d done research with the special forces, with surgeons, with top hedge fund managers and barristers. Almost all of them had psychopathic traits, but they’d harnessed them in ways to make them better at what they do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, three important questions need to be asked of Dutton. First, what exactly is his definition of success? Second, if such people are “better” at what they do because of their psychopathic traits, who exactly are they “better” than? Is he suggesting that a non-psychopath could not be just as good a surgeon? Wouldn’t it be preferable to be good surgeon <em>without</em> psychopathy, one who still cares about the well-being of his patients rather than just his own success? And third, if a person can be accomplished in a field without abandoning his conscience as a psychopath does, what good is psychopathy to anyone?</p>
<p>You see, elitist academics like Dutton are not interested in answering such questions in an honest way because their goal is not necessarily to outline a legitimate argument for the usefulness of psychopaths. What they really want is to make psychopathy a morally acceptable ideal in the mainstream.</p>
<p>Dutton does this by asserting the false notion that there are such things as good psychopaths and bad psychopaths, thereby creating a superficial dichotomy he essentially pulled from thin air. Dutton cites several character traits <em>he</em> defines as being common to good psychopaths.</p>
<p><strong>Psychopath Volume Control: </strong>Dutton argues that a good psychopath has the ability to turn up or turn down his level of perceived empathy in order to avoid burning bridges with those around him. What Dutton fails to mention (or just doesn’t understand) is that this “volume control” is very common to the average psychopath. In fact, psychopaths tend to be quite adept at reading the emotional states of others and adapting to their moods to appear more human. This is how psychopaths end up in marriages, with families and in positions of respect in a community. This is how psychopaths become leaders. Catastrophes arise, however, when the psychopath decides he is comfortable enough that he no longer needs to hide his inability to feel conscience or remorse. There is nothing special or good about a morally bankrupt person who happens to be good at disguise.</p>
<p><strong>Fearlessness:</strong> Dutton’s claim that psychopaths are fearless is simply absurd and is not based in any practical psychology that I know of. Psychopaths are afraid all of the time. What they fear most is losing what they believe belongs to them. This could be money, power or even unlucky people caught in their web. This fear might drive them to take risks in order to accomplish certain goals. But let’s be clear: Only those who take risks because they <em>love</em> what they do have truly overcome fear. Psychopaths are incapable of true love.</p>
<p><strong>Lack Of Empathy:</strong> This is the root of the movement toward rationalized moral relativism — the argument that empathy gets in the way of success and sometimes gets in the way of the “greater good.” Dutton claims that lack of empathy gives the psychopath focus, making him skilled in high-pressure situations. In a hostage situation, he says, he would much rather have a psychopath as his negotiator. Of course, he does not consider that his captors would likely be the same kinds of psychopaths he so praises in his book.</p>
<p>One would conclude by reading Dutton’s position that high-pressure jobs require a lack of empathy. And of course, the jobs with the highest pressure are those in political and military leadership. The philosophy of applying positive assumptions to psychopathic qualities is the highest dream of the elite. If you and I could be convinced to see their gruesome behavior as fully necessary to the greater good, then they will have ascended to a place beyond accountability. They become like the old gods of Olympus, dealing death and destruction above the judgment of mere mortals; and we will have handed them that godhood.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Confidence:</strong> I think Dutton is confused over the difference between confidence and narcissism. The average psychopath is often self-obsessed, which means he is willing to do anything to get what he wants. This drive might be impressive, but it is not a product of the kind of self-awareness required to gain real self-confidence. A parasitic tick is not necessarily self-confident when he digs into the flesh of a dog; all he knows is that he desperately wants the blood underneath.</p>
<p><strong>A Kingdom Of Psychopaths</strong></p>
<p>In his collected writings entitled “The Undiscovered Self,” Jung theorized according to his work with hundreds of patients that some 10 percent of the human population at any given time has latent psychopathic characteristics, with a much smaller percentage living as full-fledged psychopaths. He surmised that this latent psychopathy will often stay hidden or unconscious for most people, unless their social environment becomes unstable enough to bring out their darker side.</p>
<p>The purges in the early days of communist Russia and Stalinism, for example, brought out the very worst in many normally harmless citizens. Neighbor turned against neighbor, and betrayal for personal gain became the norm. The collectivist hive became an incubator for psychopaths. What Dutton’s psychopathic success theory does not take into account is the fact that America, and much of the world today, is becoming a breeding ground for morally bankrupt people. That is to say, our society is now designed by psychopaths for psychopaths, and only psychopaths could succeed in such an environment. We are all being encouraged to become more psychopathic, more evil, in order to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>The destruction unleashed by the psychopathy of elitism far outweighs any potential benefits that might arise from their uncompromising brand of ingenuity. Anything these freaks of the psyche might accomplish can be accomplished with far less physical and moral cost by those with self-discipline and a love of their fellow man. I would be willing to wager any power monger that if he and his miscreant organizations were to disappear, humanity would leap forward in strides never before seen. Ultimately, those who embrace evil and those who elevate psychopathy are not the key to the betterment of the world; they are obstacles to the betterment of the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;An ecosystem, you can always intervene and change something in it, but there&#8217;s no way of knowing what all the downstream effects will be or how it might affect the environment. We have such a miserably poor understanding of how the organism develops from its DNA that I would be surprised if we don&#8217;t get one rude shock after another.&#8221; Professor Richard Lewontin, Professor of Genetics, Harvard University</p>
<p>Specific plants evolve with DNA to withstand drought, rainforest conditions, severe temperatures and different soils.  A cactus thrives in the desert, but would die in a rainforest.  A tropical fern expands in the rainforest, but dies in a desert. Each plant’s DNA evolved to allow it to grow within a specific eco-system.</p>
<p>When GMO plants grow within a specific eco-system, their DNA bastardizes the normal DNA of native plants.  Specific genes mutate and become “Frankensteinized” by the genetically manipulated plants.   Thus, we human alter the Natural World via the planet.  We change the way bees operate or cannot operate with a GMO plant.  Whereby a ladybug thrived, it now dies.  What proliferated on ladybugs dies without their specific food source—and on down the line.</p>
<p>Carey Biron at Inter Press Service said, “A third of U.S. organic farmers have experienced problems in their fields due to the nearby use of genetically modified crops, and over half of those growers have had loads of grain rejected because of unwitting GMO contamination.</p>
<p>“Of U.S. farmers that took part in a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodandwaterwatch.org%2Fbriefs%2Forganic-farmers-pay-the-price-for-contamination%2F&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNGSfQ_dn9ptoVDFF8FSQL2zxf8c5w">new survey</a>, the results of which were released on Monday, more than 80 percent reported being concerned over the impact of genetically modified (GM) crops on their farms, with some 60 percent saying they’re “very concerned.””</p>
<p>&#8220;USDA has been extremely lax and, in our opinion, that’s due to the excessive influence of the biotech industry in political circles.” &#8212; Organic farmer Oren Holle</p>
<p>Again, we see ground level folks pointing fingers at our Congressional critters in Washington, DC.  Money flat-out buys their votes to stop any GMO labeling or discussion.</p>
<p> “The USDA said they didn’t have this data, but all they had to do was ask,” Oren Holle, a farmer in the Midwestern state of Kansas and president of the Organic Farmers’ Agency for Relationship Marketing (OFARM), which assisted in the new study’s production.   “Our very strong feeling is that the introduction and propagation of the genetically modified products that are coming out under patent at this point have not had the regulatory oversight that they should have, and need to involve a far broader section of stakeholders. USDA has been extremely lax and, in our opinion, that’s due to the excessive influence of the biotech industry in political circles.”</p>
<p><strong>Misplaced Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>While just one percent of corn and seven percent of soybeans grown in the U.S. came from GM seeds during the mid-1990s, by last year both of those numbers had risen to above 90 percent.</p>
<p>Biron said, “In the new study, nearly half of the farmers polled said they did not believe that GM and non-GM crops could ever “coexist”, while more than two-thirds said that “good stewardship” is insufficient to address contamination.”</p>
<p>“The USDA’s focus on coexistence and crop insurance is misplaced,” Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food &#038; Water Watch, said Monday, referring to an AC21 recommendation that GM contamination problems be dealt with through a federal insurance scheme set up to lessen the impact of natural disasters.</p>
<p>“The department must recognize the harm that is already being done to organic and non-GMO farmers and put the responsibility squarely where it belongs – with the biotech companies … Now USDA can no longer claim ignorance about this problem.”</p>

<p>“There’s been a lot of new technology introduced in agriculture over the past 50 years. But there’s always been a point of law that, whatever happens on my side of the fence, I’m still responsible for how it might affect my neighbor,” Holle notes. “GMOs take away that neighbor-to-neighbor relationship, however, as the ways in which unintended presence occurs is a completely different set of concerns from other new technologies. For that reason, they need a completely different set of rules.”</p>

<p>“At least 35 other species of genetically engineered fish are currently under development,” Friends of the Earth, an advocacy group, stated Monday. The “decision on this genetically engineered salmon application will set a precedent for other genetically engineered fish and animals … to enter the global food market.”</p>

<p>“The introduction of genetically modified foods (GMO) tampers with the essence of life in an experiment with an unknown outcome and no real way to undue the damage. The FDA purposely does not require labeling of GMO food, since no one who understands the issue would ever purchase it. This makes it all the more difficult to locate healthful food.”  Byron J. Richards, <em>The Leptin Diet: How Fit Is Your Fat?</em></p>
<p>This series exposes the outright fraud against peoples’ lives and the contempt for American citizens (and citizens of the world who eat our grains) with the injection of Genetically Modified Organism foods by the highest representatives in our U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Call it a “financial cartel” that allows GMOs to be fed to our citizenry, but worse, for the love of money, those power elites accelerate the destruction of our Natural World.</p>
<p>We humans grow too clever and too arrogant to understand the long-term penalties we heap on Mother Nature until she finds no other answers but to claw back at us, i.e., cancers, disease and more aberrant environmental disasters to come.</p>
<p>Every crop in America, Canada, Australia and much of the third world where GMO advocates like ADM and Monsanto can force their “Frankensteinization” on farmers—they push it.</p>
<p>Even with all the evidence piling up, those same elites hammer any opposition into the ground.  They “bribe” the FDA officials to not label any GMO foods so you don’t know what you’re eating.</p>
<p>We destroy our own bodies by our actions, but we also obliterate the Natural World and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Today around the world, trillions of bees suffer “colony collapse” via GMO crops.  Nature cannot figure out how to deal with plants that suffer genetic modification or DNA change-ups.</p>
<p>GMO foods represent a pitcher throwing an orange to the catcher in a Major League Baseball game.  Within several pitches, the orange wouldn’t hold its form from the violent treatment.  If the batter connected with the orange, it would splatter all over the field.  Result: the game couldn’t continue.  The players could not play and the spectators would go home.</p>
<p>But in GMO production, the consequences cannot be seen as quickly, however those “errors” against Mother Nature will surface well into the future.</p>
<p>Ethan Huff, science writer for Natural News said,  “A pair of studies recently published in the journal <em>Science</em> raises dire warnings about the continued decline of crop-pollinating insects all over the world, and what this means for the future of the world&#8217;s food supply. Both studies highlight the fact that wild pollinators like bumblebees, butterflies, and beetles are basically disappearing, and that industrial agriculture, which includes genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), are a major factor causing this insect genocide.</p>
<p>“At least half a dozen other studies published in the last couple of years have arrived at similarly disturbing findings. They do, however, shed further light on how the situation has progressed throughout the decades, pointing to corporate monoculture practices, shrinking forests and wild lands, and general changes in physical landscapes as some of the primary culprits in promoting this ruinous trend.”</p>
<p>We not only change the DNA of our fellow planetary travelers, but we destroy their habitat.  We seem to think no consequences will befall us.</p>
<p>“The earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.”<br />

<p>Last week, I interviewed with Ross Kaminsky at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.KOA.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEz2i_chUh63_gvBb066sf_KFNXUw">www.KOA.com</a> in Denver, Colorado. Mind you, this young man, about 30, sounded brilliant and highly articulate.  I liked him.   I spoke about America adding 100 million immigrants and a total of 138 million people by 2050—a scant 36 years from now.  I brought facts and compelling information to the show.  I attempted to show him and the public the ramifications of adding 138 million people—and that, we could not sustain such numbers and our environment.</p>
<p>He sat across from me saying, “We don’t have a population problem. We have plenty of water and oil.  The oceans can absorb all our carbon footprint.”</p>
<p>I said, “You’re speaking with assumptions as if they were facts.  You make statements based on belief where I make them based on facts from my research.”</p>
<p>He dumbfounded me with his arrogance that we can keep adding endless people with no consequences. He wanted everyone to live a free life.  I countered with the fact that as our population numbers rise, our freedoms decline along with balance in our Natural World.  That fact cannot be disputed.</p>
<p>I explained how our oceans suffer acidification and that reefs die with carbon footprint and how marine life cannot endure the onslaught.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t hear of it.  Mind you, this young man, traveled on six continents like I have traveled.  He lives in denial and defends it. Along with him, the majority of the American public feels the same.</p>
<p>We see the same denial with our leaders who advocate for GMOs in plants and fish—in the face of facts.</p>
<p>“In one of the studies, researchers from <em>Montana State University</em> (MSU) compared insect data collected in the late 1800s to similar data collected in the same test location in the 1970s,” said Huff. “They then compiled current data from the same area to compare to both of these other two data sets, upon which they discovered that the number of unique wild bee species had dropped by nearly half.</p>
<p>“What is perhaps more disturbing, however, is the fact that researchers observed modern bees to be generally interacting less with plants than they used to in previous generations. According to the data, the overall number of interactions between bees and plants has also dropped by roughly half, indicating a serious problem as far as the general <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2Ffood_supply.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4mPP83RjMBjk_230oZRJFYnflhA">food supply</a> is concerned, as about 75 percent of global food crops rely on pollination by animals.”</p>
<p><strong>Managed honeybees do not pollinate crops as well as wild honeybees</strong></p>
<p>The second study troubles me further:  having found that pollinating insects in general, which include a wide range of insects and other animals, continue vanishing from their normal habitats and foraging areas.</p>
<p>“Based on field trials conducted in 20 different countries, wild insects are clearly on the decline everywhere, and managed honeybee colonies established to replace them in many areas are failing to pick up where the wild honeybees left off,” said Huff.</p>
<p>&#8220;In landscapes with lower diversity and lower abundance of wild insects, the crops had less fruits,&#8221; explains Lucas Garibaldi, author of the second study. &#8220;Wild insects pollinated way more efficiently: Flowers produced twice as many fruits after being visited by wild insects and were more consistent in their production than when visited by honeybees.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Some “leaders” blame climate destabilization and other outside factors for this mysterious decline in crop <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2Fpollinators.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7QB9M6W9HC4ENdn_Etrj6rXCH5Q">pollinators</a>,” said Huff. “But the major elephant in the room, and the one that <strong>the mainstream media</strong> is desperately trying to avoid, <strong>is GMOs</strong> and the chemical-based technologies used to grow them. As we have covered time and time again, neonicotinoids and other pesticide and herbicide products are responsible for weakening and killing off bees and other crop pollinators, particularly in North America where <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturalnews.com%2FGMOs.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJczbJwcmhfHBCICAjt77fXGwRqQ">GMOs</a> are most widely cultivated.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The proof is obvious that one of the major reasons of the bees&#8217; decline is by the ingestion of GMO proteins,&#8221; explains a report by Brit Amos from <em>Global Research</em> about the decline of bee colonies. &#8220;The truth is that organic farming is relatively untouched as the bee crisis is concerned. Organic farming maintains the diversity of the eco-system and preserves the quality of the foods produced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more I research into what we and our children face with our “disfiguring” the Natural World with our poisons and GMO assault, the more sickened I am in my mind and heart.  Since I lack any power or influence, someone like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet needs to fund campaigns to stop GMO production.  After all, it’s their kids, too, who must live in this world.</p>
<p>All of this GMO nightmare stems from too many people needing food for survival with too many elites willing to sacrifice the Natural World in order to make endless billions of dollars to live in big homes, drive expensive cars and fly Lear Jets.<br />

<p>We are witnessing, I believe, a turning point in geopolitical history, one future historians may analyze as we have the Roman Empire’s fall. Vladimir Putin is making a move — and it’s not just against Ukraine. It may not be just a move against Eastern Europe. It’s not even, perhaps, just a move against US world dominance.</p>
<p>There was a time when the USSR was the “evil empire, a godless Golgotha. But that was then. Now, in 2013-14, Putin has seen fit to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/28/whos-godless-now-russia-says-its-us/?page=1">say</a>, in his December State of the Nation speech, “Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values. …Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation.”</p>
<p>This roughly coincided with Russia’s enactment of laws prohibiting homosexual propaganda and was a salvo against both the West’s Great Sexual Heresy and what enables it: moral relativism.</p>
<p>In another shot at relativism, Putin averred, “Society is now required…to accept without question the equality of good and evil, strange as it seems, concepts that are opposite in meaning.”</p>
<p>The Russian president then took aim at multiculturalism: “Today, many nations are revising their moral values and ethical norms, eroding ethnic traditions and differences between peoples and cultures.”</p>
<p>And now we’re seeing the release of Russian Culture War 2.0. In a document called &#8220;Foundations of the State Cultural Policy,&#8221; the Kremlin is doubling down and<a href="http://articles.mcall.com/2014-04-04/opinion/mc-russia-putin-west-web-20140404_1_leonid-bershidsky-ivanov-russia"> writes</a>, &#8220;Russia must be viewed as a unique and original civilization that cannot be reduced to &#8216;East&#8217; or &#8216;West.&#8217; …A concise way of formulating this stand would be, ‘Russia is not Europe.’” The document goes on to state that Russia rejects “such principles as multiculturalism and tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;projects imposing alien values on society.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, this is not your grandfather’s Russia.</p>
<p>But it very well may be your great-grandfather’s.</p>
<p>There are a few different things, I suspect, going on here. The 20 years after the Cold War’s end had been a period of <em>relative</em> co-operation between Russia and the West, but you can’t define yourself by going along (to get along) with the world’s cultural hegemon; you can’t be band leader by playing second fiddle. So Putin is defining his nation as the un-morally-wild West. In addition, he knows that to rally a people behind you, you need a boogeyman, your Eurasia, the “Nappy” (Napoleon) who will “get you,” British children, if you’re not good.</p>
<p>Yet it isn’t just that Putin is restarting the Cold War. Nor is he just an old-line KGB Bolshevik, as some stuck in commentary amber have suggested. He’s smart enough to realize that Marxism is, as the kids today would say, just so “played.”</p>
<p>He more likely wants to be the next czar.</p>
<p>What’s my theory? Try this on for size: It isn’t just that Putin wants to restore lost Russian glory.</p>
<p>He sees a chance to be a historic figure.</p>
<p>Note here that you don’t have to be good to be historic; Roman statesman Cicero called Julius Caesar an “ambitious villain,” but Caesar’s name is far better known than Cicero’s. And let’s consider what might be Putin’s calculation: the West has long been the world’s cultural trend-setter, spreading an increasingly un-Christian creed to all corners of the Earth. Of course, not everyone is on board. The Islamic abode wants nothing to do with it, but it’s Muslim; sub-Saharan Africa is largely opposed, but it lacks clout. As for South America, in addition to lacking clout it’s confused; and while China is gaining power, it’s largely pagan and non-committal on the culture war.</p>
<p>Enter the second Vladimir the Great.</p>
<p>Putin doesn’t just see a chance to define himself — and to unite the Russian people behind him — via opposition to the West, as his Marxist comrades once did.</p>
<p>He sees a chance to do it as today’s Charlemagne.</p>
<p>There’s an unsatisfied market for Christendom’s standard bearer, and Putin perceives an opportunity to exploit it. China won’t do it, Africa can’t, South America wouldn’t and couldn’t. But just as the original Vladimir the Great Christianized the Kievan Rus&#8217;, just as Charlemagne forged and helped Christianize modern Europe, Putin has a chance to lift the cross — and himself — high.</p>
<p>And the West is a gift that keeps on giving insofar as this goes. Our cultural Marxists are on the march, smell blood and will not stop. They will continue spending us into insolvency, perverting us into prone position, relativizing us into risibility and “immigrationizing” us into irrelevance. Even now, not satisfied with placing another great nail in marriage’s coffin, our militant secularists are making moves to<a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2013/09/the-slippery-slope-to-pedophilia.html"> legitimize pedophilia</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2352779/Bestiality-brothels-spreading-Germany-campaigner-claims-abusers-sex-animals-lifestyle-choice.html">bestiality</a>. It’s onward Luciferian soldiers.</p>
<p>And for Putin, it’s onward Christian soldier. As our degradation advances, Russia’s star can rise commensurately. Putin knows the West is in decline. He sees the demographic trends, that the US is transforming into a Third World/Hispanic nation and Western Europe into a Third World/Muslim continent. He knows that if there is another superpower in the near future, it will be Russia or China. And he knows what card he has to play to win this game.</p>
<p>Of course, while we could argue about whether the Christian-soldier solution is tactic and strategy or just tactic, it is so obviously prudent that it’s inconceivable Putin wouldn’t have pursued it. Just consider the benefits, starting with justification of Russian expansionism. If you’re a typical Russian, might not the idea that “the West is decadent, debauched, exhausted and effete” justify, in your mind, a Russian manifest destiny? Might it not be natural and wholly in accordance with man’s nature to believe that your moral superiority gives you the right to dominate? Note that this is the theory that helped justify the colonial powers’ imperialism: they were bringing civilization to a world of darkness. And it’s what we do to this day, applying secular values as standard. How often have we heard intervention in the Islamic “stan” du jour justified by pointing out that its rulers oppress women and are intolerant? The judgments are different, but the desire to claim the moral high ground is the same.</p>
<p>Then consider foreign relations. The USSR used to jockey for world influence with us; whereas before they had to market Marxism, however, now they can peddle purity. Standing against decadent Western secular-imperialism can win Russia many friends in Africa and even the Middle East, and most of the Far East will go with the dominant power.</p>
<p>Lastly, even if Putin is a functional atheist — even if his road to Heaven is paved with bad intentions — he surely knows that if Russia wants to prosper, Western secular/hedonist isms must be rejected. And why wouldn’t he know? As Soviet defector Yuri Bezmenov and others have<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJKJM36lMTE"> explained</a>, it was his erstwhile Marxist buddies who encouraged those movements in the West for the purposes of undermining our civilization.</p>
<p>But we’re doing a very good job of undermining it ourselves, and Putin is more concerned with building his own. Pat Buchanan recently <a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/pat-buchanan/whose-side-is-god-on-now.html">wrote</a> about this and pointed out that Putin may very well view his realm as “The Third Rome:”</p>
<p>The first Rome was the Holy City and seat of Christianity that fell to Odoacer and his barbarians in 476 A.D. The second Rome was Constantinople, Byzantium, (today&#8217;s Istanbul), which fell to the Turks in 1453. The successor city to Byzantium, the Third Rome, the last Rome to the old believers, was — Moscow.</p>
<p>Putin is entering a claim that Moscow is the Godly City of today and command post of the counter-reformation against the new paganism.</p>
<p>…Putin is saying the new ideological struggle is between a debauched West led by the United States and a traditionalist world Russia would be proud to lead.</p>
<p>Note here that the term “czar” is derived from the Latin word <em>Caesar</em>. And while Putin may be just as satisfied to be Julius or Augustus as Constantine, I’m quite sure that Marxism is no longer his bag. That would be playing second fiddle again — and the last thing the Russians want to be is like us.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<em>The attack on biblical creation in UK schools continues</em>,&#8221; Phil Robinson reports that in the dechristianized U.K. unrelenting attacks against special creation (Genesis account) display a level of aggressive intolerance that is hard to stomach, coming as they do from self-proclaimed scientifically-enlightened ‘voices of reason.’  Some schools have already banned the teaching of special creation in favor of evolutionary science.   (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>, Mar. 9, 2014)</p>
<p>Other shrill &#8216;voices of reason&#8217; go so far as to connect special creation to mental illness and child abuse. During a radio interview in Australia famous physicist and atheist propagandist Lawrence Krauss said that while in the United States recently, he stated that &#8220;<em>teaching creationism is child abuse and I think it is.&#8221; </em>(Prayer News, a publication of Creation Ministries, Apr. 2014)</p>
<p>Throughout the West and here in America a slash-and-burn operation conducted against the Genesis account, particularly its&#8217; literal and historical elements, is justified by the false idea that evolution is science, thus intolerance of special creation is often presented as a ‘science versus religion’ or ‘faith versus reason’ issue.   So successful has this war of attrition been that younger generations of Westerners and Americans have been disconnected from both Western history and its’ founding Christian-based worldview, thus like seedlings recently popped up from the soil are unconcerned that special creation, where the ultimate source of life, being and unalienable rights are found, has nearly been displaced by anti-human pagan conceptions positing billions of years of evolutionary transformism from lower kinds of things to higher and higher kinds of things&#8212; even non-human kinds of things:</p>
<p><em>“For us, the best way to create new (‘artificial’) life forms and intelligence is to allow them to emerge through evolution, as nature does, only in much shorter timeframes and with much greater efficiency and variety.”</em></p>
<p><em><br />
“For conscious evolution to be successful, we need to observe and understand the actual workings of nature, in all its dynamism, to the point of profound reverence, or ‘worship.’ This is what I call extreme nature-worshipping… From the perspective of extreme nature-worshipping, the real significance of Darwin’s evolutionary theory is not that humans descended from lower species, but that we can continue to evolve.”</em>(Cosmic Beings: Transhumanist Deism in Ted Chu’s Cosmic View, Institute for Ethics &amp; Emerging Technology, Giulio Prisco)</p>
<p>The vicious name-calling, seething resentment toward and censorship of the six day creation account and of all who profess and teach it should raise the eyebrows of any rational thinking person.  If evolution really is a fact of science then why the irrational name-calling, ridicule, scorn, shunning, resentment, intolerance and demonization?</p>
<p>The answer is that the zealous worshipper of evolution is the Spirit of our age that emerged out of the Renaissance whose answer to the Lord Jesus Christ is the Cross (crucify Him) and whose fulfillment will be the Wicked One. (2 Thess. 2:1-8)</p>
<p>From the Renaissance to our own time the Spirit has been transgressing, blaspheming, and departing that it need not obey His voice.   Like a dog returning to its own vomit, the Spirit has returned to its first love: the cult of demons in the Godless universe of matter, psychic energy, and animated forces where time is changed, past history rendered meaningless, and the liberated Spirit imbibes the cup of wrath, an intoxicating mixture of Babylonian Mysteries, incantations, spiritism, Gnosticism, sorcery, witchcraft, Hermetic magic, Kabbalah, reincarnation, astrology, and other devilish occult traditions.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation pinpoints Babylon as the post-flood center of an occult pagan Mystery religion based on advaitic monism, science of magic transformism, exalted priesthood, gnosis, secret initiations, psychic-powers, familiar spirits, androgyny, sexual perversions, and other evils.</p>
<p>Babylon embraced the Great Lie. Its inhabitants claimed the title, &#8220;I AM.&#8221; The root source of this evil religion and its occult power was the Great Dragon himself&#8230;.Lucifer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. <em>the Great Lie </em>(is) <em>the foundation stone of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, Sikhism, Taoism, the Kabala, the Greek Hermetic, Eleusinian and Gnostic beliefs, Neo-Platonism, all the occult creeds from Theosophy and the Masonic orders to the Rosicrucian&#8217;s (and) the New Age movement. The Great Lie is&#8230;the belief that man is God, that his true identity is the immortal self&#8230;that as God, he will never die </em>(and) <em>Sin and depravity are&#8230;illusions since this inner divinity is at man&#8217;s core.&#8221;</em> (The Great Lie, Tal Brooke, SCP Journal, Vol. 29:2-29:3, 2005)</p>
<p>Though the Spirit of our age claims the title “I AM” it nevertheless follows after and falls down before other fascinating men: theoreticians of evolutionary science, nature philosophy and evolutionary pagan theology. These charismatic Pied Pipers are possessed of surpassing powers of persuasion and inflexible determination of will to which the Spirit assigns more honor than to anything else.</p>
<p>The Spirit has usurped the throne of the Word Incarnate (John 1:1) because He is not good, not just or benevolent but a devil, an evil Tyrant Who, with His infliction of suffering in this life and eternal punishment in the next must be deposed. (Psalm 2:2-3)</p>
<p>Blaming our Lord for their own sins the proud, self-righteous Spirit of rebellion, hypocrisy and negation says to Him, “…<em>you are not my father</em>.”  My father is the god of forces, therefore:<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;I am I, I come out of myself, and in choice and action I make myself.&#8221;</em> (Daniel Bell, quoted by Herbert Schlossberg in &#8220;Idols for Destruction,&#8221; p. 43)</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the Spirit of our age is the “<em>striving human will</em>” seeking desperately to launch itself,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;into minor godhood in an evolving cosmos through the mechanisms of directed spiritual evolution, spiritualized science and spirit contact</em>.&#8221; The &#8216;new&#8217; spirituality now presents itself as the <em>&#8220;rightful replacement for the Revealed Word </em>(and)<em> proclaims its spiritual liberation from the worldview that informs Christianity and its freedom from </em>(the)<em> personal and wholly other God.  But this new way of self-salvation</em> (is)<em> little more than the refurbishing of an ancient spiritual mistake</em>.&#8221;  (The Making of the New Spirituality: the Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 279)</p>
<p><strong>“As it was in the days of Noah…” </strong></p>
<p>The ominous signs of this age are obvious, said the English theologian G.H. Pember (1837-1910) in his book, &#8220;<em>The Antichrist Babylon and the Coming Kingdom</em>.&#8221;  Just as it was during the pre-flood generations, open intercourse with demons (spiritism) is now common throughout Christendom and even in Russia.   In France it is the national pastime.   The apostles of the powers of darkness are everywhere proclaiming their scientific and evolutionary theories demonstrating that the world created itself and had no need of a Creator (p. 60) while the miseries which have resulted from sin,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>are blasphemously charged upon the Almighty, Who so loved the world as to give His son for it </em>(but is now)<em> impiously forbidden to curb and discipline the rebels who owe their existence to the breath of His mouth.  And when we see such men as John Stuart Mill </em>(and) <em>John Morley, the late Chief Secretary for Ireland&#8230;guiding their fellows to defiant insubordination, we can scarcely wonder that Bradlaugh&#8230;said, ‘This world might have been happy, had not the shadow of God fallen upon it.</em>” (pp. 35-36, 1888)</p>
<p><strong>Rise of Occult Evolutionary Science </strong></p>
<p>In the impeccably researched, &#8220;<em>The Making of the New Spirituality</em>,&#8221; James Herrick observes that the scientific tradition in Renaissance Europe developed around three basic approaches: the organic, the mechanical and the magical.   It was magical and/or occult science that provided the greatest impetus for scientific exploration. (p. 45)</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis underscores this point in “<em>The Abolition of Man</em>:”</p>
<p>“<em>You will even find people who write about the sixteenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know better. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse. I allow that some (certainly not all) of the early scientists were actuated by a pure love of knowledge. But if we consider the temper of that age as a whole we can discern the impulse of which I speak.”</em></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>God and the Knowledge of Reality</em>,&#8221; the Catholic philosopher and historian, Thomas Molnar (1921–2010), reveals the &#8216;temper of that age&#8217; as a spirit of rebellion against the Christian God, and this is why occult science and evolutionary thinking provided the greatest impetus. During the Renaissance, certain Christian theologians, mystics and scholars such as Emanuel Swedenborg had discovered Hermetic magic and occult Jewish Kabbalah texts which they studied and translated resulting in Hermetic Kabbalah. Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science – the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures (spiritual evolution) is the best proof of the divinity of Christ. In other words said Molnar,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;..by the time of the Renaissance the esoteric texts of the first centuries A.D. had acquired in scholarly and humanist circles an unparalleled prestige, confronting as equals the texts held sacred by the church. In Pico&#8217;s estimation, &#8216;nulla est scientia que nos magis certificet de divinitate Christ quam magia et Cabala&#8217; (there is no science that would prove for us Christ&#8217;s divinity better than magic and the Cabala.)&#8221; </em>(pp. 78-79)</p>
<p>Hermetic magic and Jewish Kabbalah are ancient Mystery Religion traditions, as affirmed by G. H. Pember in his classic work, &#8220;<em>Earth&#8217;s Earliest Ages.&#8221;   </em>Pember thoroughly examines the role of fallen angels in connection with the magic (occult transformism) they taught to pre-flood generations and compares them to the explosion of spiritism (open intercourse with evil spirits), astrology, the Mysteries and other occult traditions sweeping over Christendom.</p>
<p>Pember writes that the Mysteries are no longer veiled in mystery but boldly presented by the powerful occult brotherhood that emerged out of the Renaissance as the fruit of modern science, especially evolutionary philosophy, which the brotherhood assert was included in the instructions given,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>to the initiates of the Hermetic, Orphic, Eleusinian, and Cabbalistic mysteries, and were familiar to Chaldean Magi, Egyptian Priests, Hindu Occultists, Essenes, Therapeutae Gnostics, and Theurgic Neo-Platonists</em>.&#8221; (Pember, pp.243-244)</p>
<p><strong>Hermetic Magic<br />
</strong><br />
Hermeticism is an ancient Egyptian secret magic tradition based on a set of fourteen books known</p>
<p>collectively as the Corpus Hermeticum attributed to a mysterious figure known as Hermes Trismegistus. Implied in Hermeticism is an evolutionary process of magical transformism (spiritual evolution) moving from one kind of lower thing to another kind of higher thing:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Human beings are themselves the product of a long spiritual evolutionary process that moves from &#8216;creeping things&#8217; to fish, mammals, birds and then people.  Humans can&#8212;through occult knowledge and extraordinary ability&#8212;continue this evolutionary process and become daemons, then gods, and finally planets or stars</em>.&#8221; (The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 40)</p>
<p>With respect to Hermes identity, researchers of antiquity are divided.  Some believe Hermes was a mythical figure.  Others argue he was Ham or his son Cush.  The historian Samuel Shuckford argues that Hermes was Pathrusim, king of Thebais, the son of Mizraim, the son of Ham.   His Egyptian name was Tyoth or Thoth.  (The Sacred and Profane History of the World Connected, 1808)</p>
<p>In any case, it was Thoth-Hermes who instructed his brothers in the arts and science magic of alchemy or transmutation of a lower kind of thing into a higher kind of thing. For example, after a lengthy transformative process out of the eternally existing divine abyss (primordial matter), the self-created Sun-God Ra boasted that he “<em>came into being from primordial matter.”  </em>He made all the forms under which he<em> “appeared by means of the god-soul” </em>which he raised up out of Nu, primordial matter. (The Long War Against God, Dr. Henry Morris, p. 243)</p>
<p><strong>Occult Kabalah</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Kabalah is the key to the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists</em>.” (Occult Mason Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 626)</p>
<p>Like its’ Hermetic counterpart, Kabala implies a process of evolutionary transformism:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;the older Enoch book </em>(gives) <em>a fuller insight into the &#8220;Merkabah&#8221; and &#8220;Bereshit&#8221; lore of the ancients than the &#8220;Hekalot,&#8221; which present but fragments, while the central figure of the Cabala, Meṭaṭron-Enoch, is seen in ch. lxx.-lxxi. in a process of transformation</em>.” (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Helena Blavatsky, one of the key architects of Luciferian New Age pantheism, Kabalah derived,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em> from the older secret doctrines concerning divine things and cosmogony, which were combined into a theology after the time of the captivity of the Jews in Babylon. All the works that fall under the esoteric category are termed Kabalistic.” </em>(Blavatsky, Theosophical Glossary, p. 168)</p>
<p>The godless cosmogony of Kabala teaches the gradual condensation or evolutionary progression of a primal substance into visible matter.  This is a fundamental,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em> doctrine of the Cabala </em>(and<em>) is the ancient Semitic conception of the ‘primal ocean,’ known to the Babylonians as ‘Apsu’ and called by the Gnostics βύθος =</em>  (Anz, ‘Die Frage nach dem Ursprung des Gnostizismus,’ p. 98).</p>
<p>The Chaldean occult science and pagan Mystery Religion was embraced by apostate Jews during their captivity in Babylon and delivered to subsequent generations of initiates by word of mouth. According to Blavatsky, these initiates of the Chaldean tradition in the centuries before Christ were known as Tanaim:<br />
<em>“The kabalist is a student of ‘secret science’, one who interprets the hidden meaning of the</em></p>
<p><em>Scriptures with the help of the symbolical Kabala… The Tanaim were the first kabalists among the Jews; they appeared at Jerusalem about the beginning of the third century before the Christian era… This secret doctrine is identical with the Persian wisdom, or ‘magic’</em>.” (Ibid. p.167)</p>
<p>The Essenes were also associated with the Kabala. The Jewish Encyclopedia describes the cabalistic practices of the Essenes, which were Judaized elements of Eastern mystical traditions:</p>
<p>“<em>So, too, were the Essenes familiar with the idea of the journey to heaven…and they were also masters of angelology. The practice of magic and incantation, the angelology and demonology, were borrowed from Babylonia, Persia, and Egypt; but these foreign elements were Judaized in the process, and took the form of the mystical adoration of the name of God and of speculations regarding the mysterious power of the Hebrew alphabet …, ‘the name of God creates and destroys worlds’, to become, finally, foundations of the philosophy of the ‘Sefer Yetzirah</em>.&#8221;  (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Blavatsky the Essenes were pagan priests of the Greek goddess, Diana of Ephesus, where the Tanaim had established a college for instruction in the Chaldean mystery religion:</p>
<p>“<em>Essenes&#8230; had many Buddhistic ideas and practices; and it is noteworthy that the priests of the Great Mother at Ephesus, Diana-Bhavani with many breasts, were also denominated&#8230; It was at Ephesus where was the great College of the Essenes and all the lore the Tanaim had brought from the Chaldees&#8230; Essenes, believed in reincarnation</em>.” (Theosophical Glossary, pp. 113-14; The Secret Doctrine, Vol. II, p. 111n)</p>
<p>Eventually Alexandria, Egypt became the epicenter of cosmological and pagan religious ideas as well as the intellectual meeting point between Greek Mystery Religion/Hermetic magic initiates and nature sages and guardians of Kabala.  After the fall of Jerusalem, Alexandria was the center from which occult pagan Jews would disguise their mystery tradition in Christian terminology and attempt to penetrate the fledgling Church with heresy.</p>
<p>One of the primary tactics employed by Cabbalist pagan Jews for this purpose is the same one employed by their modern evolutionary Gnostic pagan counterparts.   It involves the reduction of the Genesis account, particularly the first three books, to allegory and myth, a ploy that eliminates the physical Adam from which all people descended and the sin that he transferred to the rest of the human race. This strikes directly at the heart of the Gospel: the need for the ‘last Adam’ to provide for us an escape from the wrath of God against sin incurred by the first Adam.  In this way, not only is the work of Christ on the cross rendered superfluous, meaning the heart of the faith is ripped out, but God is made responsible for sin and evil. (1 Peter 3:18-22; 1 John 2:22)</p>
<p>Long ago, the teachings of some of the early Church Fathers regarding the apostasy toward the end of the church age predicted the reappearance of this evil tactic. The fathers categorized it a Gnostic pagan heresy.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Heresies 6.10&#8243;</em> Hippolytus writes that the Gnostic pagan Simon Magus feigned faith and allegorized much of Scripture, especially Genesis, to support his evolutionary Hermetic and Gnostic occult pantheist teachings.   Church Fathers Ireneaus, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria reveal that Gnostic cult leader Marcion rejected the Old Testament, taught that the God of the Old Testament and his prophets are evil, made God the author of sin and removed all references that Christ was Creator (John 1:1)   (Ireneaus, &#8220;Against Heresies 1.26, 5.1,&#8221; Tertullian &#8220;Against Marcion 2.17,&#8221; Clement of Alexandria, &#8220;Against Heresies 4.29)</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Babylonian Mystery Religion is the mother of evolutionary Cabala, Gnosticism and all other occult pagan traditions:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;.especially does Gnosticism testify to the antiquity of the Cabala. Of Chaldean origin&#8230; Gnosticism was Jewish in character long before it became Christian&#8230; Gnosticism—that is, the cabalistic ‘Hokmah’ (wisdom)—seems to have been the first attempt on the part of the Jewish sages to give the empirical mystic lore, with the help of Platonic and Pythagorean or Stoic ideas, a speculative turn; hence the danger of heresy…of which the systems of Philo, an adept in Cabala&#8230;show many pitfalls&#8230;Jewish gnosticism unquestionably antedates Christianity, for Biblical exegesis had already reached an age of five hundred years by the first century C.E.  Judaism had been in close contact with Babylonian-Persian ideas for at least that length of time, and for nearly as long a period with Hellenistic ideas. Magic, also, which,&#8230;was a not unimportant part of the doctrines and manifestations of gnosticism, largely occupied Jewish thinkers. There is, in general, no circle of ideas to which elements of gnosticism have been traced, and with which the Jews were not acquainted.”  </em>(Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p><strong>Building  the New Tower of Babylon</strong></p>
<p>In the essay,<em> “The Paganization of Biblical Studies</em>,” Dr. Peter Jones, director of truthxchange and adjunct professor of Westminster Seminary CA., writes that the books of the evolutionary Gnostic pagan Presbyterian heretic Lloyd Geering, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University, are promoted by the most powerful element of the Spirit of our age—the international occult New Age Luciferian elite-pagans&#8212;as programmatic templates for the future utopian pagan community from the point of view of Christian apostasy and socialism undergirded by evolutionary pantheist orthodoxy.</p>
<p>According to Geering, the world&#8217;s future culture will be post-Christian, global, religiously pagan and evolutionary.  This agenda is remarkably similar to that of Teilhard de Chardins’ disciple, the ex-Roman Catholic Thomas Berry in his book, <em>&#8220;The Great Work</em>&#8221; which is also being implemented through texts of the UN&#8217;s global programs.</p>
<p>The rising New World Order will be post-Christian because evolution proves that human beings, as they evolved out of primordial matter, created language, then symbols, then religious explanations and God Himself.  Therefore tomorrow&#8217;s culture will be pluralistic, syncretistic, relativistic and poly-gendered because evolution integrates all scientific, cultural, religious, economic and human gender into one worldwide anthill thus when the global society emerges from the evolutionary process,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…it will require humanity to develop a new consciousness and a new form of spirituality</em>&#8221; because <em>&#8220;the new story which has become basic to the global world begins with a new word or idea&#8230;evolution.” </em>(ibid, Jones)</p>
<p>Like its’ mother, Mystery Babylon, the scientifically-enlightened ‘new&#8217; global religion of evolutionary transformism is occult pantheist advaita monism, which means that as an ancient impersonal god-force is within the cosmos, earth, human beings, rats, weeds, tumble bugs, cancer and everything else then all things are essentially &#8216;one.&#8217;  Since the god-force is within all things it is within the demonically &#8216;illumined&#8217; consciousness of every spiritually evolved initiate and adept.</p>
<p>This being the case, by means of trance states, brain-altering drugs, transcendental meditation, visualization, channeling, Zen Buddhism, Kundalini yoga, tantra, and other occult ways, the initiate can channel the god-force within thereby becoming a little god who controls matter because he controls mind. The physical world then, is an illusion because reality is inside the divine mind of the god-man.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is captured by Orwell in his book, “<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>” in which negation of the physical world is an integral part of the social and political philosophy of Big Brother and his despotic Party. At one stage in the book, Winston stumbles upon the shocking realization that in the end the Party would announce that two plus two made five because the logic of Big Brothers’ position required it since the existence of external reality was denied by his philosophy.  Thus when the Thought Police agent O’Brien tortures Winston for politically incorrect “wrong thought” he states,</p>
<p><em>“We control matter because we control the mind.  Reality is inside the skull.  You will learn by degrees, Winston.  There is nothing that we could not do.  Invisibility, levitation&#8212;anything.  I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to….You must get rid of these nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature.  We make the laws of Nature.” </em>(Orwell, “The New Spirituality and its Hallmarks, Alan Morrison, SCP Journal, Vol. 30:4-31:1, 2007, p. 19)</p>
<p><strong>Evolving Toward Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>The Aquarian Conspiracy</em>,&#8221; a book that has been called &#8216;the New Age Bible,&#8217; Marilyn Ferguson (1938-2008) admits that the ‘new age’ evolutionary pantheism and occult technologies being employed throughout America were at one time the private domain of ancient initiates.   In fact, as Constance Cumbey reveals in her thoroughly researched book, <em>&#8220;The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow,&#8221;</em> many New Age historians claim their occult religion and techniques originated in Atlantis and afterward were preserved in the ancient land of Babylon,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;and surrounding Plains of Shinar and from there disseminated throughout the earth, including Taoist doctrines of China, Mayan-Aztec teachings of Mexico and Central/South America; Great Spirit teachings of the American Indians, Hindu/Buddhist teachings of Asia, etc.&#8221; </em>(pp. 250-251)</p>
<p>After the Flood, said Shuckford, while the faithful Noah remained in the East and established the worship of the true God, eighty years after the Flood his rebellious son Ham and his sons together with other family members departed and eventually settled in the plains of Shinar where they resolved to build a tower, a monument to their own pride, vanity, ambition and rebellion against God. (ibid, p.94)</p>
<p>It was Noah’s son Ham, according to ancient Church Father Clement, who  ‘preserved’ and revived the Mystery Religion of ‘Atlantis’ and its attendant evils:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Fallen angels taught men the use of magical incantations that would force demons to obey man. After the flood Ham the son of Noah&#8230;discovered this and taught it to his sons.  This became ingrained into the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians.  Ham died shortly after the fall of the Tower of Babel.  Nimrod, called Ninus by the Greeks, was handed this knowledge and by it caused men to go away from the worship of God and go into diverse and erratic superstitions and they began to be governed by the signs in the stars and motions of the planets</em>.&#8221; (Recognitions of Clement 4.26-29)</p>
<p>In his well-researched book, &#8220;<em>Ancient Post-Flood History</em>,&#8221; Ken Johnson, Th.D., reports that the sons of Ham persuaded the people to accept that the true God was merely an impersonal creative force within all of nature, making man the highest form of life/god.  Through the power of persuasion, Ham and his sons revived magical evolutionary transformism, pantheism and idolatry. (pp. 47-48)</p>
<p>Eventually Ham was deified and worshipped by later pagans as the gods Cronus and Jupiter:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ham is represented by many writers as a very wicked, immodest, and profligate creature: Berosus (i) makes him a magician, and to be the same with Zoroast or Zoroastres, and speaks of him as the public corrupter of mankind; and says that he taught men to live as before the flood, to lie with mothers, sisters, daughters, males and brutes, and creatures of all sorts; and that he actually did so himself, and therefore was cast out by his father Janus, or Noah, and got the name of &#8220;Chem&#8221;, the infamous and immodest&#8230;&#8221; Upon seeing his father&#8217;s nakedness Ham,  &#8220;told his two brethren without; he went out of the tent after he had pleased himself with the sight&#8230; and in a wanton, ludicrous, and scoffing manner, related what he had seen: some of the Jewish Rabbins (k), as Jarchi relates, say that Canaan first saw it, and told his father of it; and some say (l), that he or Ham committed an unnatural crime with him; and others (m), that he castrated him; and hence, it is supposed, came the stories of Jupiter castrating his father Saturn, and Chronus his father Uranus.&#8221; </em>   Genesis 9:22 Gill&#8217;s Exposition</p>
<p>History did not begin after billions of years of evolution when primitive hominids swung down from the trees and discovered how to scratch crude symbols onto rocks.    Nor did it begin after the Flood.  At least 2,000 years of human existence preceded the Flood, meaning that when Noah and his family entered the ark they carried at least one hundred years of pre-flood memories, traditions, technology, and superior knowledge. Their world view was shaped by the historical Adam and Eve and the generations of their offspring.   Thus Noah and his family brought with them not only the knowledge of the personal God, Special Creation, fall of man, the Deluge, sacrifice to God for the propitiation of sin, the arts of weapon-making and warfare, knowledge of letters, symbols, math, architecture, science, cosmetics, and agriculture  but knowledge of  first-hand encounters with Watchers, their occult teachings, the Nephilim, and primeval pantheism tied to magic, spiritism, herbal abortifacients, human and animal sacrifice, drinking of blood, males marrying males and even beasts, and many other evils.</p>
<p>In affirmation, the eminent researcher of antiquity James Bailey said:</p>
<p>“…<em>human history can now be hesitantly traced back as an unbroken narrative to 4000 B.C….the picture emerging…is one of the Fall of Man in historic terms as well as his rise; it is a picture…more of degradation than of success; it is a picture of monotheism breaking down into polytheism and of the struggle to return to monotheism.  The establishment view of the history of religion gradually progressing from animism to polytheism </em>(then)<em> to monotheism is the reverse of facts</em>.” (“The God-Kings and the Titans: The New World Ascendancy in Ancient Times 1973, p. 296)</p>
<p>Four thousand years before Christ were the antediluvian generations and the Watchers in the post-flood world, making the billions of years of evolutionary transformism a fabulous fable.  It is neither ‘new’ (Ecclesiastes 1: 9-11) nor scientific except in the sense of pre-flood and post-flood occult science and attendant traditions revised and revamped for our own time, as Geering unhappily discovered.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones writes that Geering was surprised when he found out that the<em> ‘New Spirituality’ </em>has <em>&#8220;links with pre-monotheistic&#8230;nature religions,</em>&#8221; leading Jones to wryly comment that in an odd turn of events,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;.contemporary spiritual&#8217; evolution goes backwards!  Biblical theism disturbed evolutionary progress.  The clocks have to be put back </em>(for we are in the presence of)<em> a powerful pagan/Gnostic theological agenda, claiming to be spanking new, objective and scientific, but as old as the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>Clocks have to be turned back, all the way back to the days of Noah in the pre-flood world where evolution is closely connected to the devil’s lie that man is a being who though presently limited in time and space is nevertheless capable of achieving a great leap of being and magically evolving into a much more powerful god-like being in the future.</p>
<p>As the scientifically endarkened Gnostic pagan Spirit of our age simultaneously worships on the altar of ‘self’ as it self-righteously peers down its’ long, pointy nose and contemptuously sniffs and sneers at the remnant of backwards, unscientific, anti-evolution  faithful, in reality it is the entirely deluded pagan Spirit that is on a collision course with a modern version of the pre-flood world catastrophe&#8212;-and we know how badly that ended.</p>

<p>“If manufacturers are so sure there is nothing wrong with genetically modified foods, pesticides and cloned meats, they should have no problems labeling them as such. “After all, cancer will kill one in every two men and one in every three women now alive,” reports Samuel Epstein, chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition. Like our ancestors, we act in ways that will bemuse future societies. The military-industrial complex lubricates the mass-agriculture system with fossil fuels. Tons of heavy metals and other hazardous waste is sprayed on American agricultural soil.” &#8211; Adam Leith Gollne, <em>The Fruit Hunters: A Story of Nature, Adventure, Commerce and Obsession</em></p>
<p>During WWII, chemical companies like Chevron manufactured Mustard gas to kill enemies by disrupting troops’ nervous systems.  They changed their focus to continue their profits. They decided that crops growing in the fields of America needed poisons to stop the insects that nurtured them like bees, wasps and bats—all pollinators that make crops multiply and thrive.</p>
<p>They campaigned with “higher crop yields” and paid off a lot of U.S. Congressmen who “okayed” the poisons via legislation.  Chevron and other companies amassed a fortune with DDT and other nerve gases that crippled mosquitoes, flies and gnats, but quickly killed birds, rodents, hawks, eagles and countless other species living on the ground floor of Earth.</p>
<p>Why did those companies do that? Answer: billions upon billions of dollars.  You could call them financial terrorists because that’s how they must be defined.  They kill anyone for a few billion bucks.</p>
<p>Today, every single American faces cancers affecting himself, herself or a friend.  I lost four friends to cancer last year and two already this year with one more hanging on for another 30 days.  A doctor cut cancer out of my sister (melanoma) and me 19 years ago.  Terror gripped me until I cleared that drama.  To this day, I eat only organic, only filtered water, only non-GMOs, live in the country and eat nothing in a can, package or box.</p>
<p>The fact remains:  The American Cancer Society solicits funds to eradicate cancer, but they will not “touch” the fact that we poison our foods to such an extent that our bodies respond with aberrant cell behavior, i.e., cancers in all their forms.</p>
<p>Every fruit and vegetable suffers chemical sprays that become part of the produce that enters your stores and you buy it. And, you eat it.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Smith, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.organicconsumers.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNECU8WDEofN2pFCH85wDjcJbrS5Lw">www.organicconsumers.org</a>, said, “Did you know GMO plants such as soybean, corn, cottonseed and canola have had foreign genes forced into their DNA. And the inserted genes come from species, such as bacteria and viruses that have never been in the human food supply.</p>
<p>“Did you know genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are not safe? They have been linked to thousands of toxic and allergenic reactions, thousands of sick, sterile and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ and system studied in lab animals.”</p>
<p>Why isn&#8217;t the FDA protecting us?</p>
<p>“In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration claimed that they had no information showing that GMO foods were substantially different from conventionally grown foods and therefore were safe to eat,” said Smith.  “But internal memos made public by a lawsuit reveal that their position was staged by political appointees under orders from the White House to promote GMOs.  FDA scientists, on the other hand, warned that GMOs can create unpredictable, hard-to-detect side effects, including allergies, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems.</p>
<p>“They urged long-term safety studies, but were ignored. The FDA does not require any safety evaluations for GMOs. Instead, biotech companies, who have been found guilty of hiding toxic effects of their chemical products, are now in charge of determining whether their GMO foods are safe.” (The FDA official in charge of creating this policy was Michael Taylor, Monsanto&#8217;s former attorney and later their vice president.)</p>
<p>From everything I have studied, the worst men of humanity run Monsanto and ADM.  They create synthetic sugars like Aspartame, High Fructose Corn Syrup and other chemicals that you see in “Diet Coke” and in your sugar packets at every lunch counter and restaurant in America.   Top scientists implicated Aspartame as a precursor to Lupus and Fibromyalgia along with a growing list of deleterious human conditions.</p>
<p>Same with the tobacco barons:  do you think they care that 450,000 Americans die of tobacco-induced lung cancer annually for the past 50 years?  Answer: they laugh during their golf games.</p>
<p>While GMO barons live in luxury, Lear jets and country mansions, Americans suffer diseases by the millions.  And, we die for it by the millions.</p>
<p><strong>Widespread, unpredictable changes of GMOs</strong></p>
<p>During GMO “Frankensteinization”, natural genes suffer deletion or become permanently turned on or off, and hundreds may change their levels of expression.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<p>*The inserted gene is often rearranged.</p>
<p>*It may transfer from the food into our body&#8217;s cells or into the DNA of bacteria inside us</p>
<p>*The GMO protein produced by the gene may have unintended properties or effects.</p>
<p>Why do they do it?</p>
<p>The primary reason companies genetically engineer plants: to make them tolerant to their brand of herbicide. The four major GMO plants, soy, corn, canola, and cotton, are designed to survive an otherwise deadly dose of weed killer like Round-up or Weed-B-Gone. The second GM trait: built-in pesticide.</p>
<p>In other words, kill the insects that allow the world to thrive.  It becomes more insane the more I research this series.</p>
<p><strong>GM food supplement caused deadly epidemic</strong></p>
<p>In the 1980s, a contaminated brand of a food supplement called L-tryptophan killed about 100 Americans and caused sickness and disability in another 5,000-10,000 people. If GMO foods on the market cause common diseases or if their effects appear only after long-term exposure, we may not be able to identify the source of the problem for decades.  No one monitors GMO-related problems and no long-term animal studies. Heavily invested biotech corporations gamble away the health of our nation for profit.</p>

Christian leaders, Roman Catholics, the pro-family movement and others in the faith community made it abundantly clear that they opposed WV’s decision to hire people in counterfeit marriages on the grounds <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> the Bible teaches <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> homosexuality’s a sin.  It’s no secret that Bible-believers hold to the teaching that God established the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fchristianity%2Fdevotions%2Fmarriage&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4XLryW9om-O8q7R4dd5n330FTrg">marriage</a>sacrament for the purpose of bringing Him glory; thus marriage other than that which He designed does not bring glory and honor to Him. One would assume that WV’s president and board members had an understanding of what the Bible teaches on marriage – but maybe not.</p>
<p>They learn fast, though.  The board noticed a storm brewing when donors began to withdraw their financial support and they quickly changed course.  The public’s reaction was so strong that they reversed their decision faster than greased lightning.</p>
<p>In part 2 we will examine whether or not World Vision’s truly a Christian organization.  I mean, that’s the burning question, isn’t it?   One way to find out is to take a look at its website.  On the homepage they make the claim that they are a,</p>
<p><em>Christian humanitarian organization dedicated to working with children, families, and their communities worldwide to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps because I’ve spent a number of years exposing false teaching in the Church, likewise the cults and the occult, when I read the phrase “full potential” Anthony Robbins immediately came to mind.  Robbins is one of many Human Potential magnets.  He has taken on the trendy title “life coach.”  The life coach’s aim is to get you to a place where you can tap into your <em>full potential</em>.  Robbins’ beliefs are rooted in the New Thought movement.  (Those who wish to know more about New Thought can do so <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianheadlines.com%2Fnews%2Fvictory-for-religious-hiring-in-world-vision-case.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSgBad89QXr1KLaaIqki2-kV1RWg">here</a>.)  In essence “Syncretism between Christianity and early New Thought was a hallmark of this movement,” says cult expert Marcia Montenegro.</p>
<p>So &#8211; why would a “Christian humanitarian organization” choose to define itself using anti-Christian language inspired by New Thought rubbish?</p>
<p>Any organization that calls itself Christian should have as its main goal reaching families and communities around the globe with the gospel of Christ.  And if that’s not its stated goal then how is it any different from other secular organizations such as the <em>American Red Cross</em> or the <em>World Food Programme</em>. What sets Christian relief organizations apart from all the others is that they have a biblical mandate to evangelize the lost.  Jesus <em>commanded</em> His followers to:</p>
<p><em>Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.</em><em> Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</em>  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmark%2F16.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNRxbpT9bvmJx50XpOmf1hEuq_MA">Mark 16:15-16</a>)</p>
<p>For many years my husband and I sponsored children through WV.  Because it calls itself a Christian organization we just assumed that those in the field would be about the business of providing relief as well as evangelizing lost souls bound for hell.  When it became apparent to us that WV was moving more toward what is deemed a “social justice” organization, we wrote to express our concerns.  No response was forthcoming.  Eventually we stopped sponsoring children through WV and chose another organization.</p>
<p>The social gospel is a <em>false</em> gospel. (Discover more about social justice <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fsocial-gospel.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCNidz4M__mrIgNaoR--rQt4Fkyw">here</a>.)   What does Scripture tell us about spreading a false gospel?</p>
<p><em>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fgalatians%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYGxwgH4jy83VCXRzNONX8DHvTdQ">Galatians 1:6-9</a>)</p>
<p>I fully expect WV’s supporters will want me to demonstrate that WF prohibits proselytizing (sharing the gospel of Christ.)  In the process of researching for this piece I discovered all the proof doubters will need &#8212; and it comes right from the horse’s mouth.   I visited the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworldvision.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0srMyBUtvgtCnKcwkbW_XSl7klg">homepage</a>…clicked on <strong>Our-Impact…</strong>clicked on<strong> Faith-in-action </strong>and unearthed their goals and accomplishments:</p>
<p><strong><em>Our faith in Jesus is central to who we are</em></strong><em>, and we follow His example in working alongside the poor and oppressed. We serve every child in need that we possibly can, of any faith, or none. We partner with churches throughout the world, equipping them to meet the needs of their communities.</em></p>
<p>Scroll down the page to <strong>Our Approach </strong>and here’s what you’ll find:</p>
<p><strong>Do You Talk To People About Jesus?</strong></p>
<p><em>In all ways appropriate for a local context, we seek to witness to Christ — through our deeds of love and mercy, the character and conduct of our staff, and through our words of testimony. As we demonstrate the unconditional love of God to others, we are ready to give the reason for the hope within us, but expect people to evaluate the truth of our message <strong>by our actions</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>God created men and women in His image, giving each of us a free will. Therefore, we respect individuals — including their culture, faith, and beliefs. We respect the dignity and the right of all people to maintain and change their religious beliefs. We seek in every instance to be faithful ambassadors of the good news of Jesus <strong>through our actions</strong> (2 Corinthians 5:20) and hope that our lives will reflect God’s generous love for people, ultimately bringing glory and praise to Him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you expect the people you help to share your beliefs?</strong></p>
<p><em>We serve all people, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or gender. <strong>We do not proselytize,</strong> and we pledge never to exploit vulnerability to obtain a profession of faith. We do not feed the hungry as a means to an end. We feed the hungry because God cares about people who are hungry, and He wants them to be fed (Psalm 145:13-17).</em></p>
<p><em>Insisting that people hear a certain message or affirm a specific belief as a prerequisite to receiving our assistance violates codes of conduct established for disaster, relief, and humanitarian groups of which we are a member. However, our hope is that <strong>our work and lives</strong> would contribute to people becoming followers of Christ.</em></p>
<p><strong>How does being a Christian organization impact your work?</strong></p>
<p><em>Our faith in Jesus Christ is core to who we are. As an expression of God’s unconditional love for all people, especially vulnerable children, we serve alongside the poor and oppressed. <strong>We hope to live as followers of Christ by being active, visible bearers of God’s love</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>Relying on God’s grace and Spirit, we affirm the truth of the gospel and our hope in Christ <strong>through our character, speech, actions</strong>, and in the signs of God’s power at work in individual lives, in the communities where we work, and in all creation. </em>(emphasis added &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldvision.org%2Four-impact%2Four-faith-in-action&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsJQSxnVt01AmSQEvgDym4x6GCEg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>By its very words WV is a Christian organization that professes a belief in the gospel.  On its website it states that “Jesus is core of who we are.”  Yet its policy is not to proselytize?</p>
<p>Romans1:16-17 says:</p>
<p><em>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”</em></p>
<p>Instead of sharing the good news with those who are perishing, WV is all about doing “good works.”  Now don’t get me wrong.  I’m not saying Christians shouldn’t do good deeds and be “active, visible bearers of God’s love.”  But good works and sharing Christ with the lost go hand in hand.  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fromans%2F10.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfQPG1W0tVzXqufgn_mXOa7Fjikg">Romans 10:17</a> tells us that “Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”</p>
<p>In <em>Barnes’ Notes on the Bible</em>, the meaning of “hearing” is explained:</p>
<p><em>When it is said that faith cometh by hearing, it is not meant that all who hear actually believe, for that is not true; but that faith does not exist unless there is a message, or report, to be heard or believed. It cannot come otherwise than by such a message; in other words, unless there is something made known to be believed. And this shows us at once the importance of the message, and the fact that people are converted by the instrumentality of truth, and of truth only. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fcommentaries%2Fromans%2F10-17.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIWb52M-gk_flAySDxXTpnY92Qhw">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Just prior to WV doing an about face, Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, slammed the organization over its plans to hire unrepentant homosexuals.  Perhaps his, and articles like it, is the reason Richard Stearns and the board reversed their decision and decided to repent.  The question many people are asking at this juncture is how do we know that the leadership has sincerely repented of their willingness to mollify the radical homosexual lobby’s demand for them to hire gay people?  Time will tell.  However, it’s evident that at least for the time being, board members have decided it’s not in WV’s best interest to go against Bible believers and faith groups because they’re the ones who pay the bills!<br />
I’m out of room so I’ll end with an excerpt from Albert Mohler’s stinging rebuke – before WV repented:</p>
<p><em>Writing to the Corinthian Christians, the Apostle Paul stated: “Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” [1 Corinthians 6:9-10]</em></p>
<p><em>The leader of World Vision U.S. now claims that the Bible is not sufficiently clear on the sinfulness of same-sex sexuality and relationships, but he also claims a “mission of building the kingdom</em>.”  <em>The Apostle Paul makes homosexuality a kingdom issue, and he does so in the clearest of terms.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, Paul’s point is not that homosexuals are uniquely sinful, but that all of us are sinners in need of the grace and mercy of God that come to us in the gift of salvation. Thanks be to God, Paul follows those words with these: “And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.” [1 Corinthians 6:11]</em></p>
<p><em>The worst aspect of the World Vision U.S. policy shift is the fact that it will mislead the world about the reality of sin and the urgent need of salvation. Willingly recognizing same-sex marriage and validating openly homosexual employees in their homosexuality is a grave and tragic act that confirms sinners in their sin — and that is an act that violates the gospel of Christ. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albertmohler.com%2F2014%2F03%2F25%2Fpointing-to-disaster-the-flawed-moral-vision-of-world-vision%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvPKHLwaT-fRFzzO7OBGEzbze5aw">Source</a>)</p>

			<p><strong>Part 1:  Changing the DNA structure of the Mother Nature&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/belgianblue3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>In the 20st century, the human mob re-arranged rivers, deserts, rainforests and the oceans to suit its voracious appetite for dominance over the Natural World.  Stemming from that 100-year epic onslaught, we humans created communities around the globe featuring 10 million, 20 million to 36 million people piled up in mega-cities around the world.</p>
<p>We contaminated rivers with our poisons, the air with our fossil fuel exhaust and clear cut rainforests by the millions of acres.  Our onslaught of the Natural World continues with 80 to 100 species of our fellow travelers losing their existence 24/7 to our encroachment upon their habitat. (Source: Norman Myers, Oxford University)</p>
<p>One of our most prolific acts continues on the bees and other pollinators around the world.  In the past 50 years, we poisoned every crop with hundreds of chemical herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers, which, in turn, caused trillions of bees to suffer “Colony Collapse” throughout the world.  Without the bees, which I wrote about earlier this year, our species cannot feed itself.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, in the 21st century, in order to feed our 7.2 billion in numbers, we began tinkering with the structural DNA of plants and animals. </p>
<p>Today, our scientists change the DNA patterns of fish and plants in order to make them bigger, grow faster and yield more harvest: genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p>But we forgot to ask Mother Nature if our meddling in her business would cause any harm.  Amazingly, we allow governments, scientists on the payroll of companies like ADM and Monsanto, to tell us that such activities work to make our lives better with no harm to the natural world.</p>
<p>With my research on GMOs connecting their horrific harm to the Natural World and ultimately to we humans, this series will show you the “GMO Frankenstein” being foisted upon us by ugly businessmen in high places to could care less about you, your family or the rest of the species sharing this planet with us.</p>
<p>My intention in writing this series: to educate you to the incredible damage GMO foods cause you along with your family and more important: the horrific destruction to the Natural World.</p>
<p>If you look at human cancers spreading like wildfire across America and the world and every physical ailment we face in America, along the accelerating damage to bees, other pollinators and to the fish in our oceans—you will become appalled at this onslaught and its final consequences.</p>
<p>Investigative reporter Jeremy Siefert said, “When people first hear about just the basic facts concerning Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs or Genetically Engineered Foods) – the DNA of seeds altered with genes from other organisms like bacteria so food crops can withstand herbicides that will kill all other plants, patented by giant chemical companies and found in 80% of processed foods – the standard response is “Oh, my God.” For some, it’s just an exclamation, but for others, it’s the beginnings of a prayer. There’s a mixture of horror and disbelief, as if finding out we’re living inside a very strange sci-fi novel. Beyond that, it’s the sting of humiliation from being ignorant about something so big, mixed with the anger that comes from feeling like you’ve been duped.</p>
<p>“Even without understanding what a GMO is or why it matters, most of us believe as citizens of a supposedly free and democratic society that we have the right to know if GMOs are in the food we eat. The fact we don’t know, and that our right to know has been taken away by corporate greed and government collusion, should upset and mobilize people. When all the food and seed and water and air is owned and patented by giant multinational corporations, will we even protest? Do we have the wakefulness and willpower to take that first step and stand up for this basic right?” (Source: <a href="http://www.fairworldproject.org">www.fairworldproject.org</a>)</p>
<p>What I discovered in my research: ADM and Monsanto do not want you to know, along with high government officials, the deleterious effects on the Natural World that GMO food production causes in the long run.  These mega-giant corporations “own” regulatory agencies, government officials (bribes or dandy trips to anywhere in the world), and other complicit chemical companies around the world.</p>
<p>Be warned, you will not like the kind of treachery being foisted upon you by your U.S. Congress and officials who should present a moral and ethical stance against GMOs, but fail us because of one item: money.</p>
<p>Thus, as we move through this series, you may choose to save yourself and your family by buying “Certified Organic Foods” along with “Certified Non-Genetically Modified Organism” foods that give you the nutrients of Mother Nature without the “Frankenization” of your food supply and of the planet’s natural systems.  Additionally, Monsanto and other HUGE corporations work every angle to stop any “GMO” labeling of their poisonous foods.  Why do you think the do that?</p>
<p>If this information educates you enough, you may take action provided in the organizations and leaders trying to rid the world of GMOs.  Help them and ultimately, you will help your family.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if these “monsters” of Monsanto and ADM get their way, they will cripple this world, all living creatures and the structural systems that allow all life on Earth to remain in balance and allow us all to thrive.</p>

<p>If a famine befell us and you couldn’t save everyone, would you withhold the food you had and let every citizen starve rather than endure the inequality of just saving some? If recent history is any guide, certain leftists just might say yes.</p>
<p>A good example of this phenomenon involved a multiple sclerosis patient in Gothenburg, Sweden, who was denied a more effective and expensive medication — even though he was willing to pay for it — because, <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/walterewilliams/2009/03/04/swedens_government_health_care/page/full" target="_blank">wrote</a> columnist Walter Williams in 2009, “bureaucrats said it would set a bad precedent and lead to unequal access to medicine.” No wonder Winston Churchill said that socialism’s “inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.”</p>
<p>And another example just reared its ugly head in Plymouth, Michigan, where the locality’s high school is tearing down newly constructed bleachers in deference to the equality police. MyFoxDetroit.com reports on the issue, <a href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/25095169/brand-new-set-of-baseball-bleachers-torn-down-after-ruling-that-girls-softball-teams-seats-must-be-equal#ixzz2xetzrArT" target="_blank">writing</a>:</p>
<p>A new set of seating is being torn down outside the Plymouth Wildcats varsity boys&#8217; baseball field, not long before the season begins, because the fields for boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; athletics must be equal.</p>
<p>A group of parents raised money for a raised seating deck by the field, as it was hard to see the games through a chain-link fence. The parents even did the installation themselves, and also paid for a new scoreboard.</p>
<p>So what happened? Some unnamed malcontent lodged a complaint with the feral government, at which point U.S Education Department Office for Civil Rights overlords decreed that the seating must go. Ain’t equality grand?</p>
<p>Except that equality is simply a ruse. And think about it with respect to this issue: the principle is that facilities “for boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; athletics must be equal,” but are boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; athletics equal? The striking contradiction in these male/female sports equality controversies is that calls for “equality” are deferred to within the context of the acceptance and promotion of an inherently unequal system. That is to say, if equality is the guiding principle here, why have separate leagues, teams and tours — protected from the best competition — for girls and women?</p>
<p>The solution, whether it’s the Plymouth situation or calls for equal prize money in tennis, is simple. If a lightweight boxer wants the purses the heavyweights get, he needs to fight and succeed in the heavyweight class; likewise, if feminists want what the boys/men have, they should try to compete in their arena. And I do advocate this: eliminate separate categories for women, and let the sexes compete together on a level playing field. After all, to echo what Lincoln said about laws, the best way to eliminate bad social policy is to enforce it strictly. If you believe in equality, practice it.</p>
<p>Live it.</p>
<p>And live with it.</p>
<p>And since the boys’ American high-school mile record is considerably faster than the women’s world record — and since this gap appears, with some variation, across sports — my proposal would provide some necessary “policy clarification.”</p>
<p>The education department’s decree is also an attack on charity. The message is that pursuing good works just might be a waste of time because, inevitably, they’ll conflict with some government regulation or mandate. It’s in addition a quasi-Marxist assault on the market. After all, the Plymouth community’s interest in building new baseball bleachers was no doubt driven by there being greater fan turnout for the boys’ games. And the market renders such verdicts all the time. It’s said that female fashion models earn three times what their male counterparts do, bars may offer women free drinks or entry without a cover charge, and no one troubles over women-only health clubs. It’s only when market determinations seem to benefit boys or men that the equality ruse is trotted out.</p>
<p>The truth is that equality dogma is a fiction of modern times. As for the timeless, the word “equality” appears in only 21 biblical verses, mostly referring to matters such as weights and measures. There’s good reason for this, and don’t blame it on the supposed “backwardness” of religion because a devout evolutionist would have to be the staunchest believer in hierarchies born of natural inequality. As G.K. Chesterton pointed out, “[I]f they [people] were not created equal, they were certainly evolved unequal.” Look around you at the world of nature and man, which, if the evolutionists are correct, are certainly one and the same. How much equality do you see? Rams butt heads, and one ram wins and the other loses; wolves have alphas and one male lion dominates and leads a pride. Then, there are 3.1 billion possible combinations when a couple has a child. And, oh, what combinations they can be. How many of us can play golf like Tiger Woods, defy gravity and shoot baskets like Michael Jordan or compose music at four years of age as did Mozart? People have greatly varying IQs, physical capabilities, personalities, inclinations toward virtue and gifts. Equality is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>This variation exists among groups, too. Ashkenazi Jews have the world’s highest average IQ, while Asians enjoy that status insofar as major groups go. And disease and conditions have no regard for equality, either: the Pima Indians have the highest rate of diabetes on Earth, breast cancer afflicts mainly women, the incidence of Tay-Sachs disease is highest among Jews, black men suffer from prostate cancer at twice the rate whites do, while sickle-cell anemia is found almost exclusively among blacks. I guess reality is “racist.”</p>
<p>Reality is actually this: it’s completely illogical and contradictory for a person to claim on one hand that he believes in classical, cosmic-accident evolution, but on the other that all groups somehow, quite accidentally, wound up the same in capacity, inclination and worldly abilities. After all, since evolution holds that groups lived and developed separately for millions of years — subject to different environments, stresses, adaptive requirements and to the luck of the draw — their winding up “equal” was, for all intents and purposes, a mathematical impossibility.</p>
<p>Earlier evolutionists recognized and accepted this reality, mind you, and in fact <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/history/item/4675-engineering-oblivion-eugenics-the-remaking-of-man-and-unmaking-of-morality" target="_blank">became eugenicists</a>. Note here that the term “eugenics” was coined by Charles Darwin’s cousin Sir Francis Galton. Also note that the concept greatly predates the term: Greek philosopher Plato advocated murdering weak children, and the Spartans had actually done it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean I embrace eugenics or classical evolution (my views on the latter are found <a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2008/11/new-american-piece-intelligent-design-and-evolution.html" target="_blank">here</a>). The point is that whether you believe we’re accidentally different or that, as St. Therese <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/therese/stubborn.htm" target="_blank">learned</a>, there are even divinely ordained hierarchies in Heaven, equality is certainly not a thing of this world.</p>
<p>This helps explain why entities prescribing “equality” — such as the early French republic and all the Marxist killing-field regimes — become the worst tyrannies. Since equality is wholly unnatural, its mullahs must violate man’s nature, must trump it and twist it, in an effort to pound their sinister square peg into the round hole of reality. And woe betide he who defies their self-deified will.</p>
<p>Cries for equality are today the second-to-last refuge of a scoundrel (shouts of “racism” are the absolute last). Contrary to what Churchill said, however, they don’t actually visit upon us an equal sharing of misery. Rather, the pigs more equal than others will dispense the ever-diminishing pork to the peons, as they feed at the trough of modern man’s sloth, envy and error.</p>

<p>Large numbers of people today believe that modern secular science has proven the earth and cosmos to be billions of years old, and that every living thing, from fish to dogs, apes and humans, evolved from a single cell which itself is the result of chance combination of chemicals. Most believe that primordial matter resulted from the Big Bang. Certain high profile Christians like Hugh Ross and the influential Evangelical theologians and scholars who support him, teach that God is both the energizing force behind the Big Bang and the director of evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Against this way of thinking, the Word of God authoritatively teaches a six day historical creation, which today is vastly unpopular with and downright offensive to scientifically enlightened theologians and their followers.</p>
<p>The rejection of the literal six day creation is an aberration of modernism, meaning liberal (pantheist) Protestantism and its&#8217; openly hostile &#8216;secular&#8217; antitheist and atheist counterparts such as Marxist Communism and Secular Humanism.</p>
<p>Of the many early Church Fathers who wrote on Genesis, all but Augustine, who erred by teaching instantaneous creation, affirmed a literal, historic six day account of creation.</p>
<p>For instance, St. Cyril of Alexandria argued that higher theological, spiritual meaning is founded upon humble, simple faith in the literal and historic meaning of Genesis and one cannot apprehend rightly the Scriptures without believing in the historical reality of the events and people they describe. (Genesis, Creation, and Early Man, Fr. Seraphim Rose, p. 40)</p>
<p>In the integral worldview teachings of the Fathers, neither the literal nor historical meaning of the Revelations of the pre-incarnate Jesus, the Angel who spoke to Moses, can be regarded as expendable. There are at least four critically important reasons why. First, to wrest and distort Genesis so as to conform it to Big Bang and other secular scientific assumptions is to contradict and usurp the authority of God, ultimately deny the deity of Jesus Christ; twist, distort, add to and subtract from the entire Bible and finally, to imperil the salvation of believers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that we understand that the Church Fathers weren&#8217;t primitive, unscientific goat-herders as dishonest modernists have made them out to be, but rather highly intelligent, well-educated men.  Many came from backgrounds of evolutionary pantheism, occultism and pagan animism thus were intimately familiar with much of what passes for contemporary secular science such as Big Bang and Steady State theories (evolutionary cosmogonies), inflationary models, vast ages, chance, the universal life force (serpent power, Zoë, evolution) and much more, even though by other designations.</p>
<p>Long before Darwin, Greek nature philosophers (600–100BC) were teaching primitive evolutionary conceptions, abiogenesis, chance, determinism, natural selection, transmigration, reincarnation and vast ages together with many other modern assumptions.</p>
<p>The fragments of Anaximander’s (c. 610–546 BC) evolutionary speculations show he taught that ‘<i>humans originally resembled another type of animal, namely fish’ </i>while Democritus (c.460–370BC) taught that primitive people began to speak with <i>‘confused’ </i>and <i>‘unintelligible’ </i>sounds but <i>‘gradually they articulated words</i>.’ (Evolution: An Ancient Pagan Idea, Paul James Griffith, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ" target="_blank">creation.com</a>)</p>
<p>The Greek Atomist Epicurus (341–270BC), the father of contemporary materialism and many of its’ secular scientific assumptions, taught there was no need of a God or gods, for the Universe came about by a chance movement of atoms. (ibid)</p>
<p>Darwinism affirms the claim made by Epicurus that living beings created themselves, while modern evolutionary biology affirms Anaximander&#8217;s claim that humans evolved from lower order life-forms.</p>
<p>With respect to old earth or vast ages, Plato and many other Greek philosophers taught that the present universe came about millions of years ago. Writing in the fourth century AD, Lactantius said:</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Plato and many others of the philosophers, since they were ignorant of the origin of all things, and of that primal period at which the world was made, said that many thousands of ages had passed since this beautiful arrangement of the world was completed </i>… .“ (ibid)</p>
<p>After the Greeks, the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (AD23–79) said we are so subject to chance,</p>
<p><i>“….that Chance herself takes the place of God; she proves that God is uncertain</i>.” (ibid)</p>
<p>Greek and Roman philosophers received these ideas from ancient Sumerians (Babylonians), Egyptians and Hindus whose Mysteries, nature philosophies and evolutionary cosmogonies extended back centuries before Greek and Roman civilization. For example, one Hindu belief was that Brahman (the Void or Universe) spontaneously generated itself (the modern theory of abiogenesis) as something like a seed or singularity (Cosmic Egg or Big Bang) about 4.3 billion years ago and then evolved under its’ own power by which it expanded and formed all that exists:</p>
<p>“<i>These Hindus believed in an eternal Universe that had cycles of rebirth, destruction and dormancy, known as ‘kalpas’, rather like oscilla­ting big bang theories. We also read in the Hindu Bhagavad Gita that the god Krishna says, ‘I am the source from which all creatures evolve</i>.” (ibid, Griffith)</p>
<p>In India the doctrines of evolution/reincarnation/karma were thoroughly established from ancient times. They were expounded first in the Upanishads (c. 1000 BC &#8211; AD 4), the philosophical-mystical texts held to be the essence of the Vedas.</p>
<p>Representing the young earth view and resurrection of the dead (Acts 17: 16-34) the Apostle Paul contended against the Greek Epicureans (materialists) and Stoics (pantheists), representatives of Cosmic Egg theories (Big Bang), vast ages (old earth view), universal life force (evolution), void, atoms, animism (i.e. Karl Marx&#8217;s animated &#8216;divine thinking&#8217; matter), fate, determinism, and reabsorption after death.</p>
<p>Speaking to the nature sages, Paul said “<i>this is what I&#8217;m going to proclaim to you</i>,”</p>
<p>“<i>The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth&#8230; he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.&#8217; Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill. In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”</i></p>
<p>When Greek sages heard about the resurrection of the dead, many of them sneered due to their belief that the body is a rotting tomb within which their souls were trapped.   Since they believed that the fall consisted of an inexplicable plunge from being as one with the impersonal One Substance, then salvation was reabsorption of soul into the One Substance, therefore the idea of bodily resurrection was repulsive. In “<i>Adversus nationes</i>” (2:37) Arnobius complains,</p>
<p>“<i>If souls were of the Lord’s race…They would never come to these terrestrial places </i>(and)<i> inhabit opaque bodies and</i> (be) <i>mixed with humors and blood, in receptacles of excrement, in vases of urine.” </i>(The Pagan Temptation, Thomas Molnar, p. 27)</p>
<p>The framework behind the way of thinking which Paul contended against is naturalism, the ancient idea that living beings make themselves. Naturalism is like a leopard, meaning its&#8217; spots cannot be changed even by defiant Scriptural retrofitters like Teilhard de Chardin, Leonard Sweet, Hugh Ross and other natural science and evolution compromisers.</p>
<p>As Solomon said, there is nothing new under the sun.   What once was will be again.  In this light, when Peter prophesied about the <i>&#8220;scoffers</i>&#8221; in<i> &#8220;the last days</i>&#8221; who claim that<i>&#8220;everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation</i>&#8221; (2 Peter 3:4) he is speaking of this generation of God-haters and theological compromisers, who being wise in their own wisdom, willingly reject the Authority of God and six day special creation in preference of ancient ways of thinking revised and revamped for our own age.</p>
<p>The real issue behind objections to literal six day special creation is what kind of God progressive creationists and evolutionary theists believe in and peddle to unsuspecting believers.  This is a question that needs to be addressed because by espousing Big Bang and old earth views theological compromisers have elevated naturalism in the guise of secular science and evolution above the Word and Authority of God resulting in an upside-down exegesis <wbr></wbr>consisting  of abundant mind-boggling inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Their inverted creation account is in the claim of a six day creation that occurred at the end of billions of years of evolutionary process.  Logically, this means that billions of creatures lived and died long before man arrived on the scene, making the Word (John 1:1), our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the cause of death and suffering rather than the fall of Adam.  By making the fossil record the measure of a sequence of long ages, God becomes the cause of death and suffering because the history of life appears to be a record of ineptitude, extinctions and constant brutality for billions of years.  In the words of the atheist astronomer and evolution promoter Carl Sagan (1934-1996), if God,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.<i>is omnipotent and omniscient, why didn&#8217;t he start the universe out in the first place so it would come out the way he wants?  Why is he constantly repairing and complaining?  No, there&#8217;s one thing the Bible makes clear:  The biblical God is a sloppy manufacturer.   He&#8217;s not good at design, he&#8217;s not good at execution.  He&#8217;d be out of business if there was any competition.&#8221; </i> (Refuting Compromise, Jonathan Sarfati, Ph.D., F.M., p. 220)</p>
<p>The Big Bang, old earth view also leads to a philosophy of moral relativism because if men were once something else, a genderless blob of matter and then later on lizards and even later still some kind of ape-like creature, then not only are we going to become something else–maybe divine supermen, god-men, super robots or cosmic beings—but nothing can be said about transgender, ‘gay,’ and lesbianism since all life forms ascended from a genderless blob of matter generated by the inexplicable explosion of a Cosmic Egg which may or may not involve a stumbling God shaped and molded by theologians who require Him to ignite the Big Bang.</p>
<p>With regard to soul/spirit, if life arose from chemicals and then billions of years later man evolved from lower life-forms, then his rational nature, his soul, differs not qualitatively but only quantitatively from the beasts.  Like beasts, man is not a person but a creature of the earth.  Like them he has no spirit—free will, higher mental faculties, and conscience.  He is a fleshy androgynous robot or hominid whose brain is organized by the genome and the genome shaped by natural selection.</p>
<p>Dr. Sarfati argues that denial of the literal and historic meaning of Genesis (young earth view) is foundationally the result of <i>&#8216;imposing outside ideas upon the Bible.</i>&#8216; Thus, it has<i>&#8216;baneful consequences which don&#8217;t just stop with Genesis</i>,&#8217; but adversely affect many areas.  The atheist Frank Zindler enthusiastically agrees:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The most devastating thing that biology did to Christianity was the discovery of biological evolution. Now that we know that Adam and Eve never were real people the central myth of Christianity is destroyed. If there never was an Adam and Eve, there never was an original sin. If there never was an original sin there is no need of salvation. If there is no need of salvation there is no need of a savior. And I submit that puts Jesus&#8230;into the ranks of the unemployed. I think evolution absolutely is the death knell of Christianity</i>.&#8221; (&#8220;Atheism vs. Christianity,&#8221; 1996, Lita Cosner, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ" target="_blank">creation.com</a>, June 13, 2013)</p>
<p>The faith of the Christian Church and of the average Christian has had its foundation as much in the literal and historic meaning of Genesis as in that of the person and deity of Jesus Christ. Belief in a six day creation period about 6,000 years ago has been the authoritative teaching of the Church for most of its history and is essential for consistency in doctrine and apologetics.  Only with a firm, unshakable foundation in Genesis are Christians able to stand strong in their faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God…” “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.&#8221;</i>  John 1: 1-2, 14</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Very truly I tell you,&#8221; Jesus answered, &#8220;before Abraham was born, I am!&#8221;  &#8220;And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began</i>.&#8221; John 8:58 &amp; 17:5</p>
<p>If God is really Who He said He is, if He is the God Who revealed Himself to man through Jesus Christ (Messiah), then He can call everything into existence in six literal days (Gen. 1), bring about a virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23), be both God and man (Gen. 3:15; Isaiah 7:14; Zechariah 12:10 &amp; 13:7; 1 Chron. 17:1014), remove the curse due to Adam’s fall (Gen 5:21-29), resurrect Himself from the dead and ascend unto Heaven (1 Pet. 1:3; Romans 1:4; Matthew 27:53) because for the Word Who became flesh, all of these things are very simple matters.</p>
<p>So what kind of God do you believe in?  The limited, bumbling God of death and suffering, the incompetent <i>&#8216;sloppy manufacturer&#8217; </i>peddled by evolutionary theists and progressive creationists or the all-powerful personal loving God Who called everything into existence in six literal days?   The first one is an untrustworthy deity that cannot save you.  The second one is the God of eternal life.  Only He can resurrect the faithful unto eternal physical life in a physical paradise.</p>
<p>What will paradise be like? C.S. Lewis describes paradise as a place of matter, of weight and mass, and the blessed inhabitants in their resurrected bodies are the beautiful &#8220;bright solid people.&#8221; N.T. Wright explains,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<i>there will be a new mode of physicality, which stands in relation to our present body as our present body does to a ghost&#8230;.a Christian in the present life is a mere shadow of his or her future self, the self that person will be when the body that God has waiting in his heavenly storeroom is brought out&#8230;and put on&#8230;over the self that will still exist after bodily death.&#8221;</i> (Eternal Perspectives, Randy Alcorn, p. 154-155)</p>

</div>
<p>People from Yemen and Pakistan and elsewhere have told me, and have testified in the U.S. Congress, that they have a hard time convincing their neighbors that everyone in the United States doesn’t hate them.  There are buzzing killer robots flying over their houses night and day and every now and then blowing a bunch of people up with a missile with very little rhyme or reason that anyone nearby can decipher.  They don’t know where to go or not go, what to do or not do, to be safe or keep their children safe.  Their children have instinctively taken to crouching and covering their heads just like U.S. children in the 1950s were taught to do as supposed protection from Soviet nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The good news is that, of course, we don’t all hate Yemenis or Pakistanis or Somalis or Afghans or Libyans or any of the other people who might suspect us of it.  The bad news — and the news that I’m afraid would be almost incomprehensible to many millions of people around the world — is that most of us have only the vaguest idea where any of those countries are, some of us don’t know that they ARE countries at all, and we pay far greater attention to our sports and our pets than to whom exactly our government is killing this Tuesday.</p>
<p>This obliviousness comes into sharpest relief perhaps when we elect the officials who are legally called on to decide on our wars.  The extent to which Congress has handed war making over to presidents is also brought out by observing Congressional elections.  It is not at all uncommon for U.S. Congressional candidates’ platforms to entirely ignore all questions of war and peace, and to win support from either Democrats or Republicans despite this omission — despite, in particular, taking no position on the area funded by 57% of the dollars they will vote on if elected, namely wars and war preparations.</p>
<p>Here in Virginia’s Fifth Congressional District, a man named Lawrence Gaughan recently announced as a Democratic candidate for Congress.  I’d never heard of him, so I took a look at the “Issues” section of his<a title="website" href="http://www.gaughanforcongress.com/issues" target="_blank">website</a>.  Not only WAS there such a section (some candidates campaign purely on their biography without taking positions on anything), but Gaughan’s site had clear forthright statements on a number of important issues.  He backed labor unions despite their virtual nonexistence in his district.  He admitted the existence of climate change.  He backed Eisenhower era tax rates (!!).  And his statements made commitments: “I will not vote for any tax cuts for those making over 250,000 dollars a year.” “I support the Dream Act.” “I would vote for any legislation that would bring back jobs in construction, manufacturing and production.” Either this guy had real principles or he was just too new for anyone to have explained to him how to make his promises vague enough not to commit himself to any specific actions.</p>
<p>All too typically, however, when I scrolled through the “Issues,” I noticed a gap.  I sent this note off to the candidate’s staff:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your candidate has some of the best and clearest positions on domestic issues that I’ve seen, and dramatically superior to Congressman Hurt’s, but judging by his website as it stands today he seems to have no position on foreign policy whatsoever, or even on that 57% of discretionary spending that, according to the National Priorities Project, goes to militarism.  For people who support domestic social justice AND peace in the world in this district, we are put in a bind by our history. Congressman Perriello voted for every war dollar he could, and has made a career of pushing for new wars since leaving office.  Congressman Hurt is a disaster on other issues but listened to us and took a stand against missile strikes on Syria. He even listened to us on lawless imprisonment and voted against a “Defense” Authorization Act on one occasion. Helpful as it is to know what Lawrence Gaughan thinks of 43% of the budget, some of us are really going to have to know what he thinks of the larger part.  Would he cut military spending? Would he oppose new wars? Does he oppose drone strikes? Would he repeal the authorization to use military force of ’01 and that of ’03? Would he support economic conversion to peaceful industries on the model now set up in Connecticut? Would he advance a foreign policy of diplomacy, cooperation, actual aid, and nonviolent conflict resolution? Are there any foreign bases he would close?  Does he think having U.S. troops in 175 nations is too many, too few, or just right? Does he support joining the ICC? Thanks for your time!”</p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of days later, Gaughan called me on the phone.  We talked for a while about foreign policies, wars, peace, militarism, the economic advantages of converting to peaceful industries, the danger of handing war powers over to presidents.  He said he opposed wars. He said he wanted to take on the influence of the military industrial complex.  He didn’t seem particularly well informed, but he seemed to be coming from a fairly good place or to at least be willing to get there.</p>
<p>He proposed allowing military veterans to never pay any taxes.  That’s not exactly the sort of resistance to militarism that President Kennedy had in mind when he wrote that wars would continue until the conscientious objector has the honor and prestige of the soldier.  Gaughan offered no tax cuts for conscientious objectors.  Still, he said he’d get some good statements on foreign policy added to his website right away. He also said he’d be willing to debate the other candidates, including the incumbent, on foreign relations, should peace groups create such a forum and invite him.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, the next day, this appeared on Gaughan’s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>“<strong>Military</strong></p>
<p>“We have strayed from our constitution when it comes to the defense of our nation and declaration of war. I was opposed to the war in Iraq for many reasons.  The enormous price paid by our brave men and women as well as the huge financial debt that we incurred was not necessary.  Republicans in Congress continue to defer those costs on our military personnel and our veterans through the sequester and other austerity measures.</p>
<p>“Not withstanding the government shutdown, the Republican budget proposals that my opponent, Robert Hurt, has voted for over the past three years, have forced the Pentagon into reductions that have taken a tremendous toll on enlisted personnel right here in our district. These political policies are also causing reductions to TriCare, active duty health benefits, and to retired military pensions. As the greatest nation on earth, it is unacceptable that we have homeless veterans or military families who struggle to pay the bills.</p>
<p>“We owe so much to the men and women who serve. Instead of laying off soldiers and cutting funding for the VA, we could begin by eliminating the ongoing fraud by military contractors. Fraud committed by dozens of irresponsible military industry corporations have cost taxpayers more than $1.1 trillion. Eliminating this fraud would offset most of the estimated $1.2 trillion in policy savings required over the next decade in order to realize the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated $1.4 trillion in deficit reduction without ‘gutting our military’. Furthermore, as a component of tax reform, there should be a tax exemption status for veterans written into the tax code.”</p></blockquote>
<p>His topic, all too typically — people around the world should understand — is not how to relate to the 95% of humanity that is not in the United States, but how to treat “The Military.”</p>
<p>His first sentence echoes our discussion of the past three-quarters century of undeclared wars, but doesn’t spell it out.  Will he oppose wars that lack a Congressional declaration or not?</p>
<p>He picks one past war to oppose without stating his position on future wars.  He describes the costs of a war that killed some million Iraqis and destroyed a nation as all being paid by the U.S. and its soldiers.</p>
<p>He blames the sequester agreement on only one of the two parties that agreed to it, and buys into the<a title="myth" href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175815/tomgram%3A_mattea_kramer%2C_is_the_pentagon_doomed_--_to_be_flush_forever/" target="_blank">myth</a> that it has resulted in cuts to the military.  (True, Democrats in the Senate recently put up a token effort to fund veterans’ needs and were blocked by Republicans.)  Gaughan claims that we owe “so much” to members of the military who “serve.”  What exactly do we owe them? Can he name something that we owe them? He doesn’t want soldiers to be “laid off,” as if employing them is a make-work jobs program.</p>
<p>In my view we owe veterans housing, healthcare, education, a clean environment, and a healthy society because they are human beings — and we owe it equally to every other human being.  But we shouldn’t pretend that the military’s so-called “service” isn’t making us hated around the world.  We shouldn’t try to produce more veterans as if there were something noble about murdering people.</p>
<p>Gaughan almost closes on an up note.  He acknowledges fraud by military contractors.  He even calls them “military,” rather than using the misleading term “defense.”  But then he makes clear that he doesn’t want to cut the military. He wants to create efficiency to avoid cuts while saving money.</p>
<p>Would he repeal authorizations to use military force? Who knows. Would he back future wars? Who can tell? Does he believe U.S. troops should be in 175 nations? Perhaps.  But if they were in 182 would he then think 182 was the right number?  Does he favor allowing presidents to murder people with missiles from drones or by any other means?  Does he think antagonizing Russia and China and Iran should remain the focus of U.S. foreign policy?  Does he want the occupation of Afghanistan ended? Who knows.</p>
<p>He brought up a Department of Peace on our phone call, but it didn’t make the website yet.  One can hope that Gaughan’s website is a work in progress.  There’s certainly a chance he’ll become a far better candidate and Congress member than this district has had in a long time.</p>
<p>But this, dear world, is more or less how the world’s largest-ever killing machine operates.  It turns its eyes away from the machine’s work and, if pushed, debates the care of the machine itself — maintaining more or less complete obliviousness to the horrors the machine produces in those far away places where you live and die.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We are witnessing a huge geopolitical game in which the aim is the destruction of Russia as a geopolitical opponent of the US or of the global financial oligarchy…..The realization of this project is in line with the concept of global domination that is being carried out by the US.”</p>
<p>- Vladimir Yakunin, former Russian senior diplomat</p>
<p>“History shows that wherever the U.S. meddles; chaos and misery are soon to follow.”</p>
<p>- Kalithea, comments line, Moon of Alabama</p></blockquote>
<p>Following a 13 year rampage that has reduced large swathes of Central Asia and the Middle East to anarchy and ruin, the US military juggernaut has finally met its match on a small peninsula in southeastern Ukraine that serves as the primary operating base for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Crimea is the door through which Washington must pass if it intends to extend its forward-operating bases throughout Eurasia, seize control of vital pipeline corridors and resources, and establish itself as the dominant military/economic power-player in the new century. Unfortunately, for Washington, Moscow has no intention of withdrawing from the Crimea or relinquishing control of its critical military outpost in Sevastopol. That means that the Crimea–which has been invaded by the Cimmerians, Bulgars, Greeks, Scythians, Goths, Huns, Khazars, Ottomans, Turks, Mongols, and Germans–could see another conflagration in the months ahead, perhaps, triggering a Third World War, the collapse of the existing global security structure, and a new world order, albeit quite different from the one imagined by the fantasists at the Council on Foreign Relations and the other far-right think tanks that guide US foreign policy and who are responsible for the present crisis.</p>
<p>How Washington conducts itself in this new conflict will tell us whether the authors of the War on Terror–that public relations hoax that concealed the goals of eviscerated civil liberties and one world government–were really serious about actualizing their NWO vision or if it was merely the collective pipedream of corporate CEOs and bored bankers with too much time on their hands. In the Crimea, the empire faces a real adversary, not a disparate group of Kalashinov-waving jihadis in flip-flops. This is the Russian Army; they know how to defend themselves and they are prepared to do so. That puts the ball in Obama’s court. It’s up to him and his crackpot “Grand Chessboard” advisors to decide how far they want to push this. Do they want to intensify the rhetoric and ratchet up the sanctions until blows are exchanged, or pick up their chips and walk away before things get out of hand? Do they want to risk it all on one daredevil roll of the dice or move on to Plan B? That’s the question. Whatever US policymakers decide, one thing is certain, Moscow is not going to budge. Their back is already against the wall. Besides, they know that a lunatic with a knife is on the loose, and they’re ready to do whatever is required to protect their people. If Washington decides to cross that line and provoke a fight, then there’s going to trouble. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Perma-hawk, John McCain thinks that Obama should take off the gloves and show Putin who’s boss. In an interview with TIME magazine McCain said “This is a chess match reminiscent of the Cold War and we need to realize that and act accordingly…We need to take certain measures that would convince Putin that there is a very high cost to actions that he is taking now.”</p>
<p>“High cost” says McCain, but high cost for who?</p>
<p>What McCain fails to realize is that this is not Afghanistan and Obama is not in a spitting match with puppet Karzai. Leveling sanctions against Moscow will have significant consequences, the likes of which could cause real harm to US interests. Did we mention that “ExxonMobil’s biggest non-US oil project is a collaboration with Russia’s Rosneft in the Arctic, where it has billions of dollars of investments at stake.” What if Putin decides that it’s no longer in Moscow’s interest to honor contracts that were made with US corporations? What do you think the reaction of shareholders will be to that news? And that’s just one example. There are many more.</p>
<p>Any confrontation with Russia will result in asymmetrical attacks on the dollar, the bond market, and oil supplies. Maybe the US could defeat Russian forces in the Crimea. Maybe they could sink the fleet and rout the troops, but there’ll be a heavy price to pay and no one will be happy with the outcome. Here’s a clip from an article at Testosterone Pit that sums it up nicely:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sergei Glazyev, the most hardline of Putin’s advisors, sketched the retaliation strategy: Drop the dollar, sell US Treasuries, encourage Russian companies to default on their dollar-denominated debts, and create an alternative currency system with the BRICS and hydrocarbon producers like Venezuela and Iran…</p>
<p>Putin’s ally and trusted friend, Rosneft president Igor Sechin…suggested that it was “advisable to create an international stock-exchange for the participating countries, where transactions could be registered with the use of regional currencies.” (<a href="http://www.testosteronepit.com/home/2014/3/10/from-now-on-no-compromises-are-possible-for-russia.html">From Now On, No Compromises Are Possible For Russia</a>, Testosterone Pit)</p></blockquote>
<p>As the US continues to abuse its power, these changes become more and more necessary. Foreign governments must form new alliances in order to abandon the present system–the “dollar system”–and establish greater parity between nation-states, the very nation-states that Washington is destroying one-by-one to establish its ghoulish vision of global corporate utopia. The only way to derail that project is by exposing the glaring weakness in the system itself, which is the use of an international currency that is backed by $15 trillion in government debt, $4 trillion in Federal Reserve debt, and trillions more in unpaid and unpayable federal obligations. Whatever steps Moscow takes to abort the current system and replace the world’s reserve currency with money that represents a fair store of value, should be applauded. Washington’s reckless and homicidal behavior around the world make it particularly unsuitable as the de facto steward of the global financial system or to enjoy seigniorage, which allows the US to play banker to the rest of the world. The dollar is the foundation upon which rests the three pillars of imperial strength; political, economic and military. Remove that foundation and the entire edifice comes crashing to earth. Having abused that power, by killing and maiming millions of people across the planet; the world needs to transition to another, more benign way of consummating its business transactions, preferably a currency that is not backed by the blood and misery of innocent victims. Paul Volcker summed up the feelings of many dollar-critics in 2010 when he had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The growing sense around much of the world is that we have lost both relative economic strength and more important, we have lost a coherent successful governing model to be emulated by the rest of the world. Instead, we’re faced with broken financial markets, underperformance of our economy and a fractious political climate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>America is irreparably broken and Washington is a moral swamp. The world needs regime change; new leaders, new direction and a different system.</p>
<p>In our last article, we tried to draw attention to the role of big oil in the present crisis. Author Nafeez Ahmed expands on that theme in a “must read” article in Monday’s Guardian. Check out this brief excerpt from Ahmed’s piece titled “Ukraine crisis is about Great Power oil, gas pipeline rivalry”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ukraine is increasingly perceived to be critically situated in the emerging battle to dominate energy transport corridors linking the oil and natural gas reserves of the Caspian basin to European markets… Considerable competition has already emerged over the construction of pipelines. Whether Ukraine will provide alternative routes helping to diversify access, as the West would prefer, or ‘find itself forced to play the role of a Russian subsidiary,’ remains to be seen.” (Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>The western oil giants have been playing “catch up” for more than a decade with Putin checkmating them at every turn. As it happens, the wily KGB alum has turned out to be a better businessman than any of his competitors, essentially whooping them at their own game, using the free market to extend his network of pipelines across Central Asia and into Europe. That’s what the current crisis is all about. Big Oil came up “losers” in the resource war so now they want Uncle Sam to apply some muscle to put them back in the game. It’s called “sour grapes”, which refers to the whining that people do when they got beat fair and square. Here’s more from Ahmed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To be sure, the violent rioting was triggered by frustration with (Ukrainian President) Yanukovych’s rejection of the EU deal, (in favor of Putin’s sudden offer of a 30% cheaper gas bill and a $15 billion aid package) along with rocketing energy, food and other consumer bills, linked to Ukraine’s domestic gas woes ….. Police brutality to suppress what began as peaceful demonstrations was the last straw…” (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/06/ukraine-crisis-great-power-oil-gas-rivals-pipelines">Ukraine crisis is about Great Power oil, gas pipeline rivalry</a>, Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Yanukovych rejected an offer from Chevron that the EU and Washington were pushing, and went with the sweeter deal from Russia. According to Ahmed, that pissed off the bigwigs who decided to incite the rioting. (“Putin’s sudden offer of a 30% cheaper gas bill and a $15 billion aid package provoked the protests…”)</p>
<p>Like we said before; it’s just a case of sour grapes.</p>
<p>So, tell me, dear reader: Is this the first time you’ve heard a respected analyst say that oil was behind the rioting, the coup, and the confrontation with Moscow?</p>
<p>I’ll bet it is. Whatever tentacles Wall Street may have wrapped around the White House, Capital Hill, and the US judiciary; Big Oil still rules the roost. The Apostles of the Fossil are the oldest and most powerful club in Washington, and “What they say, goes”. As Ahmed so articulately points out:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Resource scarcity, competition to dominate Eurasian energy corridors, are behind Russian militarism and US interference…Ukraine is caught hapless in the midst of this accelerating struggle to dominate Eurasia’s energy corridors in the last decades of the age of fossil fuels.” (“Ukraine crisis is about Great Power oil, gas pipeline rivalry”, Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I hear someone say “Resource War”?</p>
<p>As we noted in an earlier article, NWO mastermind Zbigniew Brzezinski characterized the conflict with Russia in terms of cutting off “Western access to the Caspian Sea and Central Asia”. For some unknown reason, America’s behemoth oil corporations think the resources that lie beneath Russian soil belong to them. The question is whether their agents will push Obama to put American troops at risk to assert that claim. If they do, there’s going to be a war.</p>

<p><i>Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.</i> ~ Eph 5:11</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the movie “Son of God” has created quite a stir in the Christian community.  Before I gave the theater my money I read several reviews, blog posts, Facebook comments and viewed TV interviews of husband and wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey promoting their film.  Roma is a familiar face to many and is best-known for her role on the successful TV show “Touched by An Angel.”  Mark Burnett is the executive producer of a string of hit TV shows such as &#8220;Survivor,&#8221; &#8220;The Voice, “Celebrity Apprentice,&#8221; &#8220;Shark Tank,&#8221; and he has won several Emmys.</p>
<p>When I first heard that another full-length feature film about the life of Christ was coming to the silver screen, I was skeptical for several reasons.  First, Mark and Roma are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fproclaimingthegospel.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFC3frvRKIQF9SC4yqvYBlZF-DJFw" target="_blank">Catholic</a> and I was concerned that the movie would be produced from this perspective; a perspective that in many cases I disagree with.</p>
<p>Second, I learned that Roma earned a degree in “spiritual psychology” from the University of Santa Monica, a private graduate school founded by New Age spiritual and self-help quack John-Roger.   P.J. Miller is not being flippant when he asks:</p>
<p><i>What do you call someone who is a student of new age psychology and spiritualism? Do you call them new agers? Do you call them seekers? Would you dare call them Christian? Well, if you’re Roma Downey, then yes, you would call yourself all the above. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpjmiller.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F02%2F20%2Froma-downey-and-mark-burnetts-son-of-god-film%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgZWzUvSSuonF-KhRyFE76zVKmtg" target="_blank">Source</a>)</i></p>
<p>Third, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcIXCok9HPg" target="_blank">movie trailer</a> shows Jesus asking Peter to follow Him. Peter looks skeptical and asks Jesus what they’re going to do.  Jesus grins and replies “Change the world.&#8221;  Well, no.  Jesus never said those words to Peter!  Here’s what Jesus actually said:</p>
<p><i>While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</i><i> And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”<sup><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></sup>Immediately they left their nets and followed him. </i>(Mat 4:18-20)</p>
<p>Jesus <i>commanded</i>  &#8211; Peter and Andrew dropped what they were doing to follow Him.  (More on this in a moment.)  Another clip shows a woman sitting in a boat on the Sea of Galilee with Jesus and the apostles during the storm where Jesus walks on water.  But according to Scripture there was no woman in the boat:</p>
<p><i>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.  </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F14.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQMifrWgBs3o8e0MX5YlB1nLJO6g" target="_blank">Mat 14:22</a>) <i></i></p>
<p>In the movie Mary was the woman in the boat.  But why would they have a woman in the boat when Matthew informs us that the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Ftwelve-apostles-disciples-12.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHKds39cg97GDWLIkhPjBmgEvhiw" target="_blank">disciples/apostles</a> got into the boat.  Mary wasn’t one of the twelve disciples/apostles – no woman was!</p>
<p>Finally, S. Michael Houdmann revealed in his review of the movie that, “the reason for Jesus&#8217; death and the meaning of His resurrection are completely missing. The fact that Jesus&#8217; death is the atoning sacrifice for sin is not mentioned at all (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2F1%2520John%25202.2&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG905IHhqX4ANXW8h2rFEl3ybcB-A" target="_blank">1 John 2:2</a>).”</p>
<p>As I said, “Son of God” has elicited a great deal of controversy as did Mark and Roma’s “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.com%2Fshows%2Fthe-bible%2Fvideos%3Fmkwid%3DsSPL82MEx%257Cc_pcrid_38422039518_pkw_the%2520bible%2520miniseries_pmt_b%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_term%3Dthe%2520bible%2520miniseries%26utm_campaign%3DG_The%2BBible%26paidlink%3D1%26cmpid%3DPaidSearch_google_G_The%2BBible_&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFELoDt1jPlNQ5AsvmarGeUJWHSSA" target="_blank">The Bible</a>” miniseries produced by <i>LightWorkers Media</i>, a company owned by them. This “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunnyshell.org%2F2013%2F03%2Fhistory-channels-bible-exalts-man-over_4.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNENGZsv0GJfi2VStlvgqd5IX4qefA" target="_blank">heretical and blasphemous</a>” program aired on the History Channel last year. &#8220;We knew when we were shooting,” said Downey, “that the Jesus portion of our &#8216;Bible&#8217; series was special and we shot much more footage and we&#8217;ve re-edited many more scenes into a stand-alone feature film called &#8216;Son of God.&#8217;&#8221;   I don’t have the space to tackle the “The Bible” brouhaha.  I will say, though, that several highly controversial pastors sat on the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbibleseriesresources.com%2Fboard-of-advisors&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF58IDJY5UUlo7Sr0ZN7tr0PkvRnQ" target="_blank">Board of Advisors</a>.

<p><b>The Son of God?</b></p>
<p>“Son of God” opened on February 28, so by now a lot of folks have had the opportunity to view it in theatres and many more will have it streaming into their living rooms in a few months.  Naturally, reviews were quickly written, some good, some not so good.  (You’ll find links to the reviews at the end of this piece.) Suffice to say that in a short amount of time a lot has been said about the film.</p>
<p>Many of you won’t be surprised to learn that Mark and Roma asked Saddleback Church founder Rick Warren to help spread their version of the “good news.”   He happily agreed.  “I&#8217;ve seen most of the films produced about Jesus in the past 50 years,” said the pastor, “and ‘Son of God’ is the best.  We&#8217;re excited Jesus is back on the big screen, and we&#8217;re going to fill the theaters. I want every other faith leader in America to do the same.”</p>
<p>So – why would the man who is affectionately called “America’s Pastor” agree to promote a film that its critics describe as outright unbiblical?</p>
<p>Not only did Warren endorse the film, according to the <em>Baptist Standard</em> staff report :</p>
<p>Pastor and author Rick Warren partnered with LifeWay Christian Resources to release a Bible study related to the <em>Son of God</em> movie from 20th Century Fox, which hits theaters Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The small-group curriculum resource by Warren, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifeway.com%2FProduct%2Fson-of-god-the-life-of-jesus-in-you-leader-kit-p005683781&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcgHScltwfKoVSrmkrNSALmULXSA" target="_blank"><em>Son of God: The Life of Jesus in You</em></a>, is a companion piece to the movie produced by husband-and-wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey.</p>
<p>The six-session study features video clips from the movie and videos from Warren explaining Jesus’ teachings and their impact on people’s lives. Topics include baptism, temptation, suffering, death, resurrection and ministry. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.baptiststandard.com%2Fnews%2Fbaptist%2F16135-baptist-briefs-son-of-god-film-study-materials&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe5Hn8F-yRqcWl1o5LUyhycE_kmA" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>As a Southern Baptist preacher, Rick Warren knows perfectly well that the Roman Catholic Church holds to the view that it is the one true Church.  Thus, any church outside the RCC is anathematized (excommunicated, cursed or damned). The Protestant Reformers held the view that the RCC’s gospel is not a gospel that saves; therefore the RCC is apostate.  Anyone who rejects the true gospel – we are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone – is an unbeliever.  Period.  Warren also knows what the Bible teaches regarding believers going into <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F110124&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiF_q_2AwTLQ4sDLs1yW7u9WlT7Q" target="_blank">partnerships with unbelievers</a>:</p>
<p><i>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMAY0VmYFOOkoqEQo2lwys2YH5dQ" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>)</p>
<p>Here’s the thing.  Not everyone who professes the name of Christ has a true saving faith.  What about Mark Burnett and Roma Downey?  Do they have a true saving faith?  Let’s examine the fruit.</p>
<p><b>Endorsements</b></p>
<p>Popular pastor and author Mark Driscoll’s church bought out 3,500 seats.  In 2013 he and his wife shared a stage with Mark and Roma at Resurgence 13.  Driscoll later remarked:</p>
<p><i>We watched the world premier trailer for</i><em> </em><i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonofgodmovie.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-fkG9dZ52XXs5GpGYJ54MvuRECQ" target="_blank">The Son of God</a> at the conference, and the footage choked me up as I thought of the millions of people who will hear about Jesus through this project. I am so encouraged by God’s work through this couple. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftheresurgence.com%2F2013%2F11%2F07%2Fson-of-god-mark-burnett-roma-downey-at-r13&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5IaLbzfvROoRWgJK81bKNGWfuYA" target="_blank">Source</a>)<i></i></p>
<p>God’s work?</p>
<p><i>The connection between the Passover sacrifice (Exodus 12) and Jesus as the Lamb of God (</i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2FJohn%25201.29&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNETeolXbTfLhDRdYfRa0yM6E5HHPQ" target="_blank"><i>John 1:29</i></a><i>) is not made. The fact that Jesus&#8217; resurrection proves His victory over death and sin and guarantees a resurrected eternal life for all who believe in Him (1 Corinthians 15) is nowhere to be found.  &#8211; </i>S. Michael Houdmann</p>
<p>Another endorser of the film was “Social Justice Christian” Rev. Jim Wallis.  In my column <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120911&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIE-sMLkZMpVsz_lvVUBF_fHl0fA" target="_blank">Liberalism created the culture of evil and death, part 3</a> I wrote:</p>
<p><i>This man wears many hats.  He is the founder of Sojourner’s Magazine, speaker, author and activist.  He’s also President Obama’s “spiritual advisor.”  This alone speaks volumes.  Rev. Wallis insists that he’s an evangelical Christian even though he has abandoned the biblical gospel for the “social gospel.”  He believes he’s on a mission from God to assist the poor and oppressed to bring forth the Kingdom of God on earth. </i></p>
<p>When this purveyor of the false social justice gospel was asked for advice by the couple, he gladly gave it to them:</p>
<p><i>What won me over to the whole series was the clip about Jesus meeting Peter, the fisherman. In a Washington, D.C., premiere of “The Bible” series a few weeks ago, I had wonderful conversations with Mark and Roma. Mark asked me if they were right to have Jesus say that he wanted to change the world. Those words are not literally in the scriptures, but it seemed to him and Roma that’s exactly what Jesus was talking about. Absolutely correct, I told them both. And we went through the first few chapters of Mathew which demonstrate that truth. I love the clarity and courage of the statement from Jesus in “The Bible.”</i></p>
<p>Sunny Shell disagrees:</p>
<p><i>Christ came into the world to save sinners from the righteous wrath of God, which is the just penalty for our sins. He never said He came to change the world. He said He came to transform people by giving them new hearts and new minds through repentance and faith in Christ alone. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunnyshell.org%2F2014%2F02%2Fmovie-review-son-of-god-is-most.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF602M-mwbXh5wlSVWozEG6U1sNzQ" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>The <i>Examiner</i> listed the names of churches and organizations that distributed tickets for a so-called &#8220;Theater Take-Over&#8221;:</p>
<p><strong><i>Joel Osteen</i></strong><i>, pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Tex., who is distributing 8,000 tickets donated by an anonymous donor; <strong>Jerry Falwell</strong>, Jr., of Liberty University which has more than 12,000 students; <strong>Craig Groeschel</strong> of LifeChurch which has 18 campuses in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles with over four million members and Miles McPherson of the Rock Church with weekly attendance of more than 10,000 in San Diego, Calif.</i> (Emphasis in original - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.examiner.com%2Farticle%2Frick-warren-son-of-god-best-movie-of-jesus-50-years&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFU_NyUVASLjKJekDa5tfeSfhWwKw" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>In an article that appeared on <i>Fox News</i>, Mark and Roma wrote:</p>
<p><i>In all our combined years in the entertainment industry, we’ve never seen anything like this kind of grass-roots support for a project. It is truly miraculous.</i></p>
<p><i>So, too, is the unprecedented depth and breadth of those who have endorsed the film. Pastors like Rick, as well as scholars and faith organizations, have graciously supported our effort to share this story of our Savior – though they belong to different denominations, adhere to varying theological doctrine, worship God in their own unique ways. </i></p>
<p><i>Bishop T.D. Jakes of The Potter’s House in Dallas said “the audience will be enthralled, encouraged and inspired.” </i></p>
<p>S. Michael Houdmann was not enthralled by the movie.  In his review he writes:</p>
<p><i>The Son of God presents a Jewish Messiah who is crucified, dies, comes back to life, and commissions His followers to spread the word. But why did He have to die? What is the meaning of the resurrection? What is the message the apostles were supposed to proclaim, and why was it worth dying for? <b></b></i></p>
<p>More from the <i>Fox News</i> article…</p>
<p><i>Joel Osteen of Lakewood Church in Houston called it “an epic work that touches the heart.”</i></p>
<p><i>The Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles Jose Gomez says it’s “a very important movie because it gives us the opportunity to realize God’s presence in our own lives.”</i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fopinion%2F2014%2F02%2F27%2Fson-god-miraculous-journey-to-big-screen%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-smuaswla4b1ygxCikRAo3i46Xw" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Certainly there are by now “Church leaders” that are sincerely shocked to find out that they endorsed a movie produced by New Age Catholics.  Here’s more proof from a 2010 article <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbecksmithhollywood.com%2F2009%2F04%2Froma-downey-happy-out-of-spotlight%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_oBUaRK962PgJULO81uMLpLoLuw" target="_blank">Roma Downey Happy Out of the Spotlight</a> that shows she’s an advocate of New Age/New Thought spirituality:</p>
<p><i>Says Roma, who lives in Malibu, ‘My kids go to school about a 40-minute drive away. I’m open to the group’s opinion about what we listen to on the way there. On the way back, I get my own selections — books on tape by Eckhart Tolle, Tony Robbins…My husband says I’m so self-realized I’m practically levitating.’</i></p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with Eckhart Tolle, he’s a New Ager.  A few years ago Tolle paired up with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120507&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExBXarCqOHwN2-lSGzbTk6euqV8A" target="_blank">Oprah Winfrey</a> to do 10 online classes on XM Satellite radio on his blockbuster book “A New Earth: Are You Ready to Be Awakened.”  Oprah and Tolle took participants through his book chapter by chapter.  Regrettably, a large number of professing Christians took the class!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christiananswersforthenewage.org%2FArticles_HumanPotential1.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-F3ncTQ4AYRlwb3R9_5522XPqIg" target="_blank">Human Potential</a> guru and &#8220;coach for success” Anthony Robbins once said: &#8220;My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel tons of pleasure and very little pain.&#8221;  Evidently no pain is experienced after completing a barefoot firewalk, a self-empower technique Robbins’ teaches to get an otherwise sane person to walk on a bed of burning hot coals during his “Unleash The Power Within” seminar.  On this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od-bcLqelnY#t=11" target="_blank">video</a> you’ll hear the sound of drums beating and the crowd chanting “YES! YES! YES!” as Robbinswhips them into a frenzy in preparation for the firewalk.</p>
<p>More…</p>
<p>Roma appeared on “psychic medium” <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F080328&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoEPHJhGb6qyChcEUmyIZoszlzew" target="_blank">John Edward’s</a> TV show and allegedly spoke to her deceased mother.  What does the Bible have to say about consulting a medium?</p>
<p><i>And he burned his son as an offering and used fortune-telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_kings%2F21.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbHPjPuA6cdkYAYbK5InRfolex4Q" target="_blank">2 Kings 21:6</a>)</p>
<p>Well, it’s apparent that Roma, who says she loves the Bible, is unaware—or doesn’t care&#8211;that God says consulting a medium is evil.</p>
<p>Later she collaborated with Edwards by providing a CD to accompany a book he wrote:</p>
<p><i>Roma prays the entire rosary</i><i> on the beautiful CD that comes along with this book. It’s quite lovely and gives you the special opportunity and a unique spiritual closeness to Roma to be able to pray right along with her as if she was right there at your side.”</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdavemosher.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F03%2F06%2Froma-downeys-comments-and-connections-with-psychic-medium-john-edward-show-she-is-not-a-christian-as-she-claims-but-a-new-ager%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFvRX_2PmQgJ6HjxzeL4MTWIkJ4Q" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>So now you know a bit about two New Age gurus Roma Downey looks forward to listening to each day and an occultist she collaborated with.  The worldview of these men is as far from Christianity as the Earth is from Pluto.</p>
<p>P.J. Miller sat listening to Jim Bakker introduce Mark and Roma on Bakker’s TV show and recalled “their previous work on the History Channel’s The Bible and how they managed to literally re-write the Bible itself, and presented another gospel message altogether. I was captured by their … aggressive but subtle attempt to portray themselves as ‘believers’.  The sappy spiritual love fest that permeated on set showed me that something was indeed changing within Christianity, and that something was another Jesus being introduced to the masses.”</p>
<p><i>Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.</i><i> For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAUYRr8l_vl0ukuYfMAByj5ZPIRw" target="_blank">Mat/ 24: 23-24</a>)</p>
<p>After several weeks of due diligence I’ve decided that “Son of God” is not a film I wish to see.  In addition to the concerns I have included in this article, my research has turned up many more &#8212; way too many to incorporate here.  Most troubling is the astonishing lack of discernment shown by some of our so-called Christian leaders.  The Son of God I serve is best described in the Bible which is the inerrant, infallible, inspired Word of God.  Inspired means that God moved through the writers to convey to those who read it the words He wanted us to hear.  So to change the words that Christ spoke is prideful and wicked.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that those who are unfamiliar with the biblical Jesus and see this film will not come away with a clear understanding of His mission here on Earth.</p>
<p><i>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_john%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFadypSTjyThkBi-zCJpgrDYPqWQg" target="_blank">1John 2:2</a>)<i></i></p>
