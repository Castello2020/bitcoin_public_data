Has the White Rabbit been too fast for you so far? If you are reading this article, you are here to wake up. Here are five ways to slow that white rabbit down so you can catch up.</p>
<h3>1) Money is a Hoax</h3>
<blockquote style="color: #666666;"><p>“The Western worldview says, in essence, that technological progress is the highest value and that we were born to consume, to endlessly use and discard natural recourses, other species, gadgets, toys, and often, each other. The most highly prized freedom is the right to shop. It’s a world of commodities, not entities, and economic expansion is the primary measure of progress. Competition, taking, and hoarding are higher values than cooperation, sharing, and gifting. Profits are valued over people, money over meaning, entitlement over justice, “us” over “them.” This is the most dangerous addiction in the world, not only because of its impact on humanity but because it is rapidly undermining the natural systems that sustain the biosphere.” – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608681785/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1608681785&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=IL74I5QRBT5JVLOR" target="_blank">Bill Plotkin</a></p></blockquote>
<div style="color: #3b5436;" align="center"></div>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">It is not the more evolved aspect of ourselves that tricks us into thinking that we need money to survive; it’s <a href="http://letter-z.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-get-Power-over-Power-Capital-Munificence-and-Hero-Expiation">the less evolved aspect of ourselves that does the tricking.</a> With our advanced technologies we imagine that we know the way the world works, when, for the most part, we have forgotten how everything is connected.</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">Until we can relearn “a language older than words,” and once again engage in a healthy dialogue with nature and the cosmos, we will continue to be tricked by the less evolved aspects of ourselves. The more awareness we bring to this extremely complicated cognitive dissonance, the more possible it will be to achieve an ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable world.</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">As it stands, however, the <a title="25 Fast Facts About The Federal Reserve" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/09/17/25-fast-facts-federal-reserve/" target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a> is a house of cards guarded by a red herring. Money is the opiate of the masses, and the masses are too busy spending it on worthless crap to get to know each other as healthy individuals, let alone as a healthy community. We have become Pavlov Dogs, and money is our dinner bell. But money was never meant to be horded, or even amassed, it was meant to circulate as a way of uplifting the community. And yet here we are, hoarding and amassing, while our communities are in unhealthy disarray. It’s high time we abandoned the force-fed shibboleth that having more money makes us better people. It doesn’t. Being healthy, compassionate and moral is what makes us better people.</p>
<h3>2) Debt is Fiction</h3>
<blockquote style="color: #666666;"><p>“There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.” –  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743223136/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0743223136&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=FHURETHURFJAP75Y" target="_blank">John Adams</a></p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">Unfortunately our nation has been enslaved by debt. Our current system is not an economic system at all, but an ecocidal system; an intrinsic obsolescence of conspicuous consumption. It’s a grave misfortune that efficiency, sustainability, and preservation are the enemies of our socioeconomic system. This has got to be the most bizarre delusion in the history of human thought, a retarded Ponzi scheme<em> en masse</em>.</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">But it’s difficult to get people to understand something when money, and especially debt, prevents them from understanding it. Instead of ownership, give us strategic access. Instead of equity, give us equality. Instead of one-track-minded profit, give us open-minded people. Instead of unsustainable monetary-based economics, give us a sustainable resource-based economy, which is basically the scientific method applied to ecological and social concerns.</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">As tough as it is to hear, nature is a dictatorship. We can either listen to it and fall into harmony or deny it and suffer. Ask yourself this question by Fleet &amp; Lasn: “When the economic system fails, will we know how to behave, how to act, how to appreciate, how to value, how to survive, how to be and how to love in a world that no longer defines relations by money?”</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">Defenestrate your TV set!</p>
<h3>3) Media is Manipulation</h3>
<blockquote style="color: #666666;"><p>“Any dictator would admire the uniformity and obedience of the U.S. media.” – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375714499/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0375714499&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=E6CBIXC2A4VBLKQO" target="_blank">Noam Chomsky</a></p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #3b5436;"><a title="Is Everything in the Mainstream Media Fake? – 6 Examples of Media Manipulation" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/02/27/everything-mainstream-media-fake-6-examples-media-manipulation/" target="_blank">Media</a> has always been an effective method for manipulating people. We are social creatures who are also psychological creatures. This combination makes us unwittingly vulnerable to the power of suggestion. As it stands, media has been our Achilles Heel. These days the “news” we receive from corporate media is more likely to be disinformation. Skepticism is a must when reading or viewing the information provided by these outlets.</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">The key: Don’t believe anything you hear and only half of what you see. Analyze the Kool Aide before you swallow it. Even then, be prepared to vomit it back up at the first sign of deception. Remain circumspect and question all authority. They don’t have our best interest at heart. They only want our money, and to remain powerful. Like Wendell Berry wrote in the Unsettling of America, “People whose governing habit is the relinquishment of power, competence, and responsibility, make excellent spenders. They are the ideal consumers. By inducing in them little panics of boredom, powerlessness, sexual failure, mortality, paranoia, they can be made to buy virtually anything that is “attractively packaged.””</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">We are slowly becoming more aware of corporate media lying to us. But they know we know they’re lying to us. And we know they know we know they’re lying to us. With enough inertia, this debacle of a process just continues until we are eventually lying to ourselves. And here we are. Like the great Baruch Spinoza once surmised, “The supreme mystery of despotism, its prop and stay, is to keep men in a state of deception, and cloak the fear by which they must be held in check, so that they will fight for their servitude as if for salvation.” And here we are, unless we decide to wake up.</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">For it is seeking you.</p>
<h3>4) Government is a Corporation</h3>
<blockquote style="color: #666666;"><p>“The end of democracy and the defeat of the American Revolution will occur when government falls into the hands of lending institutions and moneyed incorporations.” – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979486/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0812979486&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=5I3OQEHN42QOSOXJ" target="_blank">Thomas Jefferson</a></p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">Here’s the thing: we do not live in a democracy, and we probably never really have. <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/87719/princeton-concludes-what-kind-of-government-america-really-has-and-it-s-not-a-democracy">A prestigious Princeton study</a> recently concluded that we live in an oligarchy: rule by a few individuals. And these individuals just so happen to be plutocrats, making this particular flavor of oligarchy a plutocracy: rule by the rich.</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">The problem is that money itself has become an immoral agent within an otherwise amoral system that praises itself as moral. Ask yourself: do you wish to live out harried lives of nine-to-five slavery, giving up your days to heartless corporations that don’t give a damn about anything except making money, or do you wish to live a happy life of loving compassion, doing what you enjoy, in spite of plutocracy, oligarchy, and tyranny?</p>
<p style="color: #3b5436;">The Occupy Movement succeeded in shifting the tenor and shape of debate in the world, but we must not rest on our laurels. Trickle-down economics DOES NOT WORK! Austerity economics DOES NOT WORK! Corporations are NOT people. Money does NOT equal speech. It’s a trap. If we don’t get big money out of politics then everything we want to do will be hopeless. We need to be smarter with our mobilization tactics for the change and allocation of power within our society. So far the security and surveillance state has boxed us in, like the great MLK Jr. said, “Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war.”</p>

</div>
<p>The experience of humanity is driven and defined by our own consciousness, which is a product of our sophisticated brain functions. We are consciousness in every way shape and form. Control of this miracle of <a title="6 Shifts In Consciousness We Are Experiencing Right Now" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/06/04/6-shifts-consciousness-experiencing-right-now/">consciousness</a> is sought by a few individuals who are actually suffering from a mental (disconnect) disorder. What psychiatrists sometimes refer to as the psychopathic mind. Unfortunately, one of the characteristics of being a psychopath is that the individual exhibiting the psychopathic behavior has little to no insight into their own actions. In this example, we can say that the “consciousness” is missing from the equation.</p>
<p>This insight to one’s own behavior is also a reference for distinguishing who might be considered “normal” and who might be considered schizophrenic “impaired” or “abnormal” This might lend perspective as to why groups of people (as opposed to individuals), such as governments and corporations, are capable of acting and speaking as a group in ways that are destructive to consciousness and mental and <a title="51 Symptoms of Spiritual Awakening – How Many Do You Have?" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/03/21/51-symptoms-of-spiritual-awakening-how-many-do-you-have/">spiritual expansion</a>of our species. Ironically, when an individual acts the same way, he may be considered impaired; but groups, however, will get a pass thus allowing (immune) group entities to implement such damage on the species.</p>
<p>One could measure this phenomenon scientifically by documenting physiological body changes that occur when humans are exposed to images or ideas that reflect “non-consciousness” related items (images of war, government oppression) versus measurable body changes seen when exposed to consciousness related items (love, compassion, human rights issues, etc). Basic vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure, also brain wave spikes readings, magnetic or tomography images are all factors and signs that might be measured to compare the human physiological responses to the concepts of non-consciousness-related reality versus consciousness and <a title="97 Percent of Our DNA Has a Higher Purpose And Is Not ‘Junk’ As Labeled By Scientists" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/09/13/97-percent-of-our-dna-has-a-higher-purpose-and-is-not-junk-as-labeled-by-scientists/">higher purpose</a>.</p>
<p>Government would have us think that it is protecting humanity from itself. This non-conscious force we call government gets its life-force from an artificial set of rules called the legal system which non-conscious government would have you think is the script that your reality is not only based on but controlled entirely by. This is like someone walking into a room and notifying everyone in the room that their consciousness and state of awareness of existence doesn’t exist any more. What? You can take someone’s money and belongings, and even forcefully do harm to them and imprison them, but how can you steal someone’s consciousness? Government’s answer to this? By eliminating it or ignoring its existence.</p>
<p>This is one of the prime realities about the concept of government and any group efforts that robs the individual human being of his/her natural state of conscious equilibrium. This is a crime like any other crime, being committed on that individual human being. This can only be appreciated from the standpoint of third party looking down on the species as a whole. When you consider it in this context it is then easy to appreciate this reality. It then becomes easy to see how non-conscious government concepts act as a cancer to the species.</p>
<p>With humanity now swimming in knowledge about itself thanks to technology and the Internet – knowledge which can no longer be ignored – we are only now beginning to see the early results of what happens when truth, awareness and consciousness is triggered by a massive pulse of lies which jolts the consciousness of the species.</p>
<h4>Edward Bernays (Propaganda) Effect Now Backfiring?</h4>
<p>With the current global awakening now accelerating at speeds that must not be pleasing to the globalist gangsters, it is reasonable to reflect back on the concept of propaganda, groupthink and group manipulation for the purposes of a certain agenda. I would like to suggest that it is possible that the global awakening we are seeing may partially and indirectly have been contributed to by <a title="The Age of Confusion – Mass Manipulation, Propaganda and Frequency Prisons" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/09/20/age-confusion-mass-manipulation-propaganda-frequency-prisons/" target="_blank">Edward Bernays</a> himself. After all, it was Bernays who admitted openly how these mass mind control techniques were A: Real; B: They worked; C: They worked on the masses because they worked on the individual in a perceived group setting. Bernays showed us that humans responded to clever timing, images and messages that appealed to our subconscious urges, imagination and thoughts. Can it be that we are seeing the culmination of many of these factors backfiring against the original CIA/U.S./NWO plans?</p>
<p>They hoped to continue to fool everyone with their propaganda. They planned and executed false flag operations and reinforced them with their planned propaganda, precisely timed talking points, images and sensationalism. But did they ever consider that the propaganda effect would actually wear out after so many decades of continued obvious lies and hypocrisy? Perhaps they did, and perhaps that is why there is so much talk about depopulation as seen in their own <a title="All Wars Are Well Planned Banker Wars, Including World War 3" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/05/28/wars-well-planned-banker-wars-including-world-war-3/">Georgia Guidestones</a>. Perhaps the talk by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465027261/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0465027261&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=HVCDFDO3HTSJZ7MT" target="_blank">Zbigniew Brzezinski</a> about how much “easier” it is to kill a million people than control them is an admission that they know humanity will factually wake up as a whole and thus a last resort for the psychopath globalists before they must face their doom.</p>
<p>I believe this is all the end result of hundreds of years of propaganda now fully exposed due to the information age. One thing I’ll say about Bernays is that he never hid what he was doing. He told you straight forward what he was doing, even writing several books about it.</p>
<p>The global political events we are seeing exposed in real-time are a first of its kind. Because of all the released information and knowledge, and because of the Internet, we can track globalist mafia crimes in real-time in a rather exciting way which has led to the alternative or “New Media.” What started off as a truth movement with many little cousin movements all around the world has morphed into one big freedom and consciousness movement. Thankfully, many of the lines that separated us have blurred as humans recognize that they need to come together more than anything else.</p>
<p>Humanity is responding to this non-consciousness force we call government, by coming together and slowly ignoring our political, religious and philosophical differences and instead focusing on the common enemy which is now emerging as the forces that represent non-consciousness that we call governmental control systems. This is at the root of all of our struggles. We hear TV pundits tell us that humans must be controlled by a federal and global unchallenged government. Many of the script-reading advocates for the big government top-down control system just happen to have significant voices in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>No one at mainstream media dare stands for freedom and individual sovereignty. Anyone who does ends up getting fired or being asked to quit. Hollywood TV shows as well as the educational system are all supporting the paradigm of big government. Obama’s primary message to Americans seems to be about not listening to those (lunatics? radicals?) that stand for individual freedoms. Obama may actually be the only U.S. president warning America not of tyranny and the need to stand for the Constitution and Bill of Rights, but instead he’s warning his sheep to beware of those warning of tyranny. One of the things the globalists have accomplished is they’ve made it easy to identify those who are with us and those who are not.</p>
<p>Given the current global awakening in light of all the information and spiraling propaganda mentioned above, we can now simplify the battlefield in such a way that it is easy to identify the enemies of freedom. We can now ask anyone the simple question: Power to the state or power to the people, which one do you choose? Will you side with those that demand freedom and sovereignty from government or will you side with those that feel the people are the property and responsibility of big government, and those who rebel are terrorists? The state or the individual? Choose one and take sides now.</p>
<p>We know where NBC stands, and CNN and all the left-wing Obama supporters. Despite their attempts to sound pro-America, we know where Fox News and the Republicans stand also. When measured with this simple question of State versus Individual it is easy to see that both Democrats and Republicans are exactly the same. They are both controlled by criminal elements in the .1 percent class who want their one world government. It is then easy to see how the human element of humanity that is living and breathing, is now fully awakening to this non-consciousness element we’ve been calling government.</p>
<p>Now we can observe how humanity will deal with this force that has cycled its way into an over-sized oppressive control mechanism. Humanity is now realizing that freedom is more a realization than anything else. Yes, realizing something is an expression of consciousness and learning or integration of knowledge and the awareness of this newly acquired knowledge.</p>
<p>With humanity now realizing that government is a useless obstacle in the way of human thriving and freedom, I expect we will witness phenomenal things in the coming months and years. I see humanity now actually slowly but surely pulling together in an all-out effort to save itself from government.</p>
<p>I never thought of this concept myself until recently and I don’t see any other way to articulate it. This is where we are. We are now seeing the expression of this reality in many freedom lovers world wide. This was essentially the very same spirit behind the founding of America. This was the spirit behind the Constitution and Bill of Rights and the primary meme of those initial years when America was founded. It doesn’t mean that the founding fathers were saints or any of that, it means that the spirit of freedom that drove them to do what they did is back, in fact this modern-day rekindling of freedom is and will be much more intense than what the founding fathers imagined. Humanity is now realizing it didn’t finish the job. There is already a track record for getting this freedom thing done, and this track record is serving as a precious guideline for those of us who are new at this.</p>
<p>Let freedom ring, and I look forward to witnessing the end result of this focused effort now closing in on government. No, no one was injured in the writing of this article. Not a shot fired. Consciousness knows no violence, and the desire to thrive and be free is a realization. This battle is strictly mental warfare (as Bernays would have told you) and the transition from rooting for big government to control the people, to empathizing with your own species and connecting with other humans in a conscious way to exercise and celebrate your individual freedom from government is seamless.</p>
<p>Awakening from the matrix cannot be measured with blood, bullets, drones or violence. It (the individual’s awakening) can only be delayed with fear – external, engineered, artificial, government-crafted fear. This awakening is being triggered by the realization that the fear of tyranny is much greater than any artificial fears the government can come up with.</p>
<p>The human awakening has thus triggered a long-awaited re-prioritizing of fear within the species, which is rendering the globalists primary weapon of mass deception obsolete. To think, we need only overcome their engineered fears to render the concept of over-controlling big government obsolete. Once we reach this point (and we are very close) we can then focus more on officially implementing all the solutions to the new world order at a mass scale. Till then, mass knowledge of solutions are now spreading globally as part of the awakening despite the fact that many of the solutions are still being contained by government using fear and intimidation.</p>
<p>The day is soon coming when these barriers of fear will dwindle as more and more people resort to being the change they want to see in the world. It’s already happening and it’s a wonderful thing to see.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Aliens visiting Earth would report back to their superiors: ‘It’s quite amazing, those people worship images. They know it and they pretend not to know it.’&#8221;</em> — Hypnotherapist Jack True.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a backgrounder for my mega-collection, <a href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank">Exit From The Matrix</a>, which contains many exercises designed to liberate an individual from the standardized perception of reality—and usher in his own creative reality.</p>
<p>Mass mind control focuses on two elements: image and feeling.</p>
<p>By linking the two primary elements, it is possible to short-circuit thought and “cut to the chase,” when it comes to enlisting the allegiance of huge populations.</p>
<p>Two seemingly unrelated events spurred my interest in mass mind control.</p>
<p>On the evening of April 12, 1945, I listened to a radio report on the death of Franklin D Roosevelt. I was seven years old.</p>
<p>I became upset. I didn’t know why. I was angry at my own reaction.</p>
<p>Forty years later, I pulled into a gas station near my apartment in West Los Angeles. I got out of my car and took the cap off my gas tank. I looked to my right and saw Tony Curtis sitting in his car. I was shocked.</p>
<p>A few days later, I began making notes under the heading of “image-emotion cues.” At the time, I was working as a reporter, writing articles for LA Weekly. I knew next to nothing about mind control, MKULTRA, Soviet psychiatric gulags, Chinese re-education programs, or US psychological warfare operations.</p>
<p>But because I had been painting for 25 years, I knew something about the power of images.</p>
<p>I remembered my first exhibition of paintings in LA, at my friend Hadidjah Lamas’ house. We had hung my work in her large living room and dining room. Hadidjah had enlisted the services of a friend who had videotaped me painting in my studio, and at the exhibition she set up a television set out on her patio and continuously played the videocassette.</p>
<p>People came through her front door, almost automatically walked through the house to the patio, as if guided by an unseen hand, and watched the video; then they came back inside and looked at the paintings.</p>
<p>They would stop at a painting and say: “That picture was in the video!” It excited them.</p>
<p>My first note on “image-emotion cues” was, “Investing an image with importance. Projecting emotion into an image.”</p>
<p>Projecting emotion into a newspaper image of the president, FDR. Projecting emotion into the screen image of Tony Curtis. Projecting emotion into a video of a painter working in his studio.</p>
<p>When people encounter an image, when they invest it with importance, they project feeling into the image—and this all happens in a private sphere, a private space.</p>
<p>If this didn’t happen, there would be no way to control populations through images. It wouldn’t work. It all starts with a person setting up his own personal feedback loop that travels from him to an image and back again.</p>
<p>Coming out of World War 2, US psychological warfare operatives knew they could turn their skills to political purposes. They had just succeeded in making Americans believe that all Japanese and German people were horribly evil. They had been able to manipulate imagery successfully in that area. Why couldn’t they shape America’s view of a whole planet that lay beyond personal experience?</p>
<p>They could and they did. But the power to do that emanated from the fact that every person invests images with feeling. That’s where it really starts.</p>
<p>I had seen the 1957 film, Sweet Smell of Success, a number of times. I admired it. Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis gave tremendous performances. When, decades later, I saw Curtis sitting in his car at that gas station, I was “working from” the emotion I had invested in his onscreen image. It produced a sense of shock and paralysis for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Other people might have rushed up to Curtis and asked for his autograph. With me, it was shock, cognitive dissonance. Ditto for the death of FDR. I was working off newspaper pictures I’d seen of him, and the feeling I’d invested in those presidential images. Other people, when FDR died, went out into the street and hugged their neighbors and wept openly. For me, it was upset and shock and anger.</p>
<p>There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with investing emotion in images. It can be exhilarating. It can be uplifting. As a painter, I know this in spades. Putting emotion into images can, in fact, vault you into a different perception of reality.</p>
<p>But on the downside, it can also take you into lockstep with what media/propaganda operatives want you to experience, second-hand.</p>
<p>We focus to such a degree on how we are being manipulated that we don’t stop to consider how we are participating in the operation. And our own role is clear and stark: we invest images with feeling.</p>
<p>So how does one individual’s projection of feeling into an image become a uniform projection of the same feeling into one image, by millions of people? How does what one person invests privately become mass mind control?</p>
<p>Through external instruction or cues. And also, by engendering the idea that there is only a limited palette of emotions to work with in the first place.</p>
<p>Why do millions of people fall into line?</p>
<p>Because they don’t realize they started the whole ball rolling themselves. All they know is: images are connected to feelings.</p>
<p>If they knew they were the real power in the whole operation, if they knew they were investing feelings into images all day long, if they could actually slow down enough to see how they do this….then they would be far less prone to taking instruction about what feelings they “ought to” invest in second-hand images.</p>
<p>Hypnotherapist Jack True unceremoniously put it to me this way: “If a dog could analyze how he got from eating meat to drooling at the sound of a bell that came at feeding time, he could stop drooling.”</p>
<p>(If Chris Matthews could analyze how his own voluntary investment of feeling in the image of Barack Obama sends a tingle up his leg, he could stop tingling.)</p>
<p>We see images of people rioting all over the Middle East. We see burning flags and crowds outside embassies. We’re supposed to invest our own anger and resentment into those images. Unless we’re suddenly told those rioters are actually “the good rebels,” in which case we’re supposed to invest our joy in the images.</p>
<p>We see a picture of miles of flat farmland and (GMO) corn waving in the breeze. We’re supposed to invest that image with feelings of happiness and pride.</p>
<p>Nowhere are we told we can back up a step and realize that we are the ones who begin the whole process, by projecting feelings into images. Any images.</p>
<p>When I was 19, I was sent to a trained expert in New York to take a Rorschach (ink-blot) Test. I was displaying signs of what would now be called Oppositional Defiance Disorder.</p>
<p>The expert said he wanted me to tell him everything I saw in each ink-blot. I took him at his word.</p>
<p>An hour later, I was still working on the first blot. I was describing everything from bats and owls and chickens to space ships and buckets of hidden treasure in caves.</p>
<p>Well, I was cheating a little. I wasn’t really describing what I saw. I was imagining. I was taking off from what was on the page and improvising. This was outside the bounds of the Test.</p>
<p>The expert was seething. He was sweating, because he had many other blots to show me, and it was late in the afternoon, and he was looking at spending the entire evening with me. Finally, he held up his hand and put an end to the Test.</p>
<p>I wasn’t playing his game. Among other sins, I wasn’t investing a limited palette of feelings in the images. Therefore, my choices of “what to see” in the blots expanded greatly.</p>
<p>When I go to a museum, I like to watch people stand in front of abstract paintings. Many of them are stumped. They’re trying to figure out what feelings they “are supposed to” project into the painting. They’re looking for “instruction,” and there isn’t any. They’re asking for mind control, and they’re not getting it.</p>
<p>Fanaticism of any kind begins with individuals projecting feelings into images. This is harnessed by leaders, who then choose the images and direct which feelings are permitted. The tempting prospect for the follower is: participation in a drama that goes beyond what he would ordinarily experience in life. This is bolstered by the idea that what he is doing is moral.</p>
<p>In an election season, people on the left are urged to project messianic feelings into images of X. People on the right are cued to invest feelings of pride, hope, and “tradition” into images of Y. The real candidates aren’t actually experienced.</p>
<p>Since Vietnam, shooting wars have been more difficult to sustain among soldiers. “In the old days,” feelings of hatred could be projected into images of enemies that included civilians, so overtly killing everybody on foreign soil was easier to accept. Now, soldiers are taught “enemy combatant” and “civilian” are two different images that require the injection of two different feelings.</p>
<p>Here at home, police and military are taught, more and more, to invest feelings of suspicion into images of American civilians. This is an acceleration of mass mind control for law enforcement.</p>
<p>The astonishing number of civilians who participate in government and corporate surveillance of the public, through technological means, learn to invest “dead empty feelings” into images of citizens, as if these targets are nothing more than ciphers, units.</p>
<p>Bizarre instances of police detaining and questioning parents who allow their children to play unsupervised reveal another accelerating trend. These confrontations start with neighbors snitching on the parents. The neighbors have learned to invest feelings of panic, suspicion, and anger in images of “free children.”</p>
<p>In all these cases, there is no real experience. It’s all second-hand. It’s all feeling-projected-into-image.</p>
<p>In the medical arena, countless advertisements and news stories are geared to convince people to invest feelings of trust in images of doctors. The suggestion, “Ask your doctor if X is right for you,” is framed as the solution to a little problem. The problem is set this way: Drug X is wonderful; drug X has serious adverse effects; what to do? Solution: ask your doctor; trust him; he knows.</p>
<p>As the class of victims in society has grown by leaps and bounds, including any group that can organize and promote itself as needing help or justice—going miles beyond the people who really do need assistance—citizens have been trained to invest feelings of sympathy and concern for all images of victims everywhere, real or imagined. This, too, is mass mind control.</p>
<p>Pick an image; invest feelings in it. Facts don’t matter. Evidence doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You’ve heard people say, So-and-so (a celebrity) has become a caricature of himself. Well, that’s what it means. The celebrity has projected massive feelings of approval into a concocted, cartoonish image of himself.</p>
<p>As a society, we can go on this way until we become a horrific cartoon of a cartoon (well, we’re already there), or we can step back and discover how we invest emotion into images, and then use that process to pour feelings into visions of our own choosing and invent better futures.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of time, leaders have portrayed themselves as gods. They’ve assembled teams to promote that image, so their followers could project powerful emotion into the image and thereby cement the leaders’ control and power.</p>
<p>The game isn’t new. Understanding the roots of it within each individual could, however, break the trance of mass mind control.</p>
<p>During the first West Nile fake outbreak of 1999, I spoke with a student who had just dropped out of medical school. He told me he’d been looking at electron-microscope photos of the West Nile Virus, and he suddenly realized he was “supposed to” invest feelings of “great concern” in those images.</p>
<p>Somehow, he broke free from the image-feeling link. He was rather stunned at the experience. His entire conditioning as a medical student evaporated.</p>
<p>Parents all over the world are having the same experience vis-a-vis vaccines. They realize they’re supposed to invest fear in images of germs and disease, and they’re also supposed to invest feelings of hope and confidence in images of needles and vaccines. They see the game. They’re supposed to remain victims of mass mind control.</p>
<p>But they’ve awakened.</p>
<p>We’ve all been taught that what we feel is always and everywhere out of our control. These feelings are simply part of us, and we have to act on them. The alternative would be to sit on them and repress them and turn into androids, robots.</p>
<p>This is simply not true. There are an infinite number of feelings, and as strange as it may sound, we can literally invent them.</p>
<p>This, it is said, is inhuman. It’s a bad idea. It’s wrong. It would lead us to “deserting the human community.”</p>
<p>Nonsense. That’s part of the propaganda of mind control. If the controllers can convince us that we’re working from a limited map of emotions and we have to stay within that territory, they can manipulate that limited set of feelings and trap us.</p>
<p>The power of art is that it shows us there are so many more emotions than we had previously imagined. We can be much freer than we supposed.</p>
<p>The synthetic world of mind control and the handful of feelings that are linked to images is what keeps us in thrall.</p>
<p>The world—the world of what we can be—is so much wider and more thrilling and revealing.</p>

</div>
<p>Once upon a time, there was an industrial combine in Nazi Germany called <strong>IG Farben</strong>. It was the largest chemical/pharmaceutical octopus in the world. It owned companies, and it had favorable business agreements with companies from England to Central America to Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/nixon-rockefeller-ig-farben-and-global-control/" target="_blank">As I mentioned in a recent article</a>, the author of The <em>Devil’s Chemists</em>, Josiah DuBois, traveled to Guatemala in the early days of World War 2, and returned with the comment that, as far as he could tell, Guatemala was “a wholly owned subsidiary of Farben.”</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical empire was and is one of the major forces behind the European Union (EU). It is no accident that these drug corporations wield such power. They aren’t only involved in controlling the medical cartel; they are political planners.</p>
<p>This is how and why Big Pharma fits so closely with what is loosely referred to as the New World Order. The aim of enrolling every human in a cradle-to-grave system of disease diagnosis and toxic drug treatment has a larger purpose: to debilitate, to weaken populations.</p>
<p>This is a political goal. It facilitates control.</p>
<p>IG Farben’s component companies, at the outbreak of World War 2, were <strong>Bayer</strong>, <strong>BASF</strong>, and <strong>Hoechst</strong>. They were chemical and drug companies. Farben put Hitler over the top in Germany, and the war was designed to lead to a united Europe that would be dominated by the Farben nexus.</p>
<p>The loss of the war didn’t derail that plan. It was shifted into an economic blueprint, which became, eventually, the European Union.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s first president was <strong>Walter Hallstein</strong>, the Nazi lawyer who, during the war, had been in charge of post-war legal planning for the new Europe.</p>
<p>As the Rath Foundation reports: In 1939, on the brink of the war, Hallstein had stated, “The creation of the New Law [of the Nazis] is ONLY the task of the law-makers!”</p>
<p>In 1957, with his reputation sanitized, Hallstein spoke the words in this manner: “The European Commission has full and unlimited power for all decisions related to the architecture of this European community.”</p>
<p>Post-war, IG Farben was broken up into separate companies, but those companies were following a common agenda. If, for example, you want to know why the endless debate over labeling GMO food rivals the real issue—banning GMO crops altogether—you can look to these Farben allies: Bayer, BASF, and <strong>Sanofi</strong>, among others.</p>
<p>They are among the leaders in GMO research and production. BASF cooperates with<strong>Monsanto</strong> on research projects. Sanofi is a leader in GM vaccine research.</p>
<p>The original IG Farben had a dream. Its executives and scientists believed they could eventually produce, synthetically, any compound in a laboratory. They could dominate world industry in this fashion.</p>
<p>The dream never died. Today, they see gene-manipulation as the route to that goal.</p>
<p>I refer you to the explosive book, <em>The Nazi Roots of the Brussels EU</em>, by Paul Anthony Taylor, Aleksandra Niedzwiecki, Dr. Matthias Rath, and August Kowalczyk. You can read it at <em>relay-of-life.com</em>. It is a dagger in the heart of the EU.</p>
<p>At the Rath Foundation, you can also read Joseph Borkin’s classic, “The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben.”</p>
<p>In 1992, I was deeply engaged in researching the specific devastating effects of medical drugs. Eventually, I concluded that, at the highest levels of power, these drugs weren’t destructive by accident. They were intended to cause harm. This was covert chemical warfare against the population of the planet. The <strong>Rockefeller-Standard Oil-Farben</strong>connection was a primary piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>It was, of course, Rockefeller (and <strong>Carnegie</strong>) power that forced the birth of pharmaceutical medicine in America, with the publication of the 1910 Flexner Report. The Report was used to excoriate and marginalize Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and other forms of traditional natural practice, in favor of what would become the modern juggernaut of drug-based treatment.</p>
<p>In an article about the FDA, “Medical Murder in the Matrix,” I point out the fact that this federal agency has permitted at least 100,000 deaths of Americans, per year, from the direct effects of drugs it, the FDA, has certified as safe.</p>
<p>The FDA knows these death figures. “Unintended” and “accidental” can no longer be applied to this ongoing holocaust.</p>
<p>The same can be held true for the pharmaceutical industry itself.</p>
<p>People are exceedingly reluctant to come to this obvious conclusion. They prefer to hem and haw and invent excuses or deny the facts.</p>
<p>To understand the dimensions and history of the ongoing chemical warfare against the population, in the form of medical drugs (and of course pesticides), one must factor in the original octopus, IG Farben.</p>
<p>World War 2 never ended. It simply shifted its strategies.</p>
<p>And just as one can trace extensive collaboration between major American corporations and the Nazi war machine, during the military phase of the war, today you see American corporations wreaking destructive havoc on the American people, as Dow, DuPont, Monsanto and others “work their magic for a better life.”</p>
<p>In any fascist system, the bulk of the people working inside the system, including scientists, refuse to believe the evidence of what is happening before their own eyes. They insist they are doing good. They believe they are on the right side. They see greater top-down control as necessary and correct. They adduce reasonable explanations for inflicted harm and death.</p>
<p>This is how and why conspiracies can exist. Only a few people, at the very top, need to know the true motives.</p>
<p>Everyone else tells themselves fairy tales. This deep-seated obsession is an integral part of mind control, and ultimately it is self-inflicted.</p>
<p>The self-created victim calculates: “I would rather stay in my dream than wake up to a nightmare.”</p>
<p>Yes, but acknowledging the nightmare is a step on the road to liberation.</p>
<p>In centuries past, empires conquered foreign lands and made colonies out of them. When that era ended, a less overt style of military and economic conquest was initiated. But there is something most people don’t realize.</p>
<p>When richer nations now go into poorer nations, the so-called incidental goal of bringing “life-saving” medical care with them is a front and a pose.</p>
<p>One of the chief goals of the conquerors is, in fact, pharmaceutical. Changing the habits of populations, so they come to rely on these drugs is high on the to-do list. It rings up profit, of course, for the pharmaceutical empire, and it also poisons the poor into even greater desolation than they are already experiencing. They become even easier to control.</p>
<p>On top of that, the actual untreated causes of the routine desolation—starvation, generation-to-generation malnutrition, contaminated water supplies, lack of general sanitation, overcrowding, and previously stolen agricultural land—are shoved on the back burner of the global media.</p>
<p>Suddenly, we learn that various germ-caused diseases are the real scourges of these countries, and help is coming (slowly), in the form of drugs that kill the germs, along with the medical heroes who will deliver these drugs.</p>
<p>This is a cover story. It’s a preposterous lie. In the conditions of desolation mentioned above, it doesn’t matter what germs are present, and trying to attack them is futile and absurd.</p>
<p>The general desolation weakens and destroys immune systems. At that point, what would normally be completely harmless germs, any germs, can sweep through an area and cause death and severe illness, because the routine processes of the immune system, which would immediately neutralize the germs, are disabled.</p>
<p>The “medical intervention” is meant to defer, for yet another day, the remedying of the actual problems that keep causing disease—and the medical drugs create new and lethal toxicity, leading to more deaths.</p>
<p>This is the standard op of the modern pharmaceutical empire. To know it is proceeding apace, all you have to do is see foreign doctors getting off planes in Third World countries, or read about some drug giant that is undertaking a humanitarian program of supplying medicines and vaccines to “people in desperate need of them.”</p>

<p>Their <i>al Qaeda</i> terrorists soundly defeated by Hezbollah forces in Syria, the City of London Illuminati banksters have turned their sights on resource-rich Ukraine. They knew Russian President Vladimir Putin would be distracted by the Sochi Olympics, along with the barrage of threats and propaganda being hurled his way by these demonic Zio-fascists and their Western media lapdogs.</p>
<p>With unlimited time and money at their disposal, this is the bankster <i>modus operandi</i>. They attack where they see opportunity, retreat when defeated, then attack another sector of the planet within days based on vulnerability and resources.</p>
<p>Ukraine declared independence from the old Soviet Union in 1990. In 2004-2005 Western NGOs worked with CIA/Mossad/MI6 assets to stage the phony Orange Revolution. Victor Yuschenko became Prime Minister but was poisoned during the campaign. Western media blamed it on the Russians, but it was likely a Mossad operation since he was succeeded by more bankster-friendly right-wing billionaire Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko had co-led the Orange Revolution and is one of Ukraine’s richest people. In 2005 <i>Forbes</i> named her the third most powerful woman in the world. In 2007 she traveled to the US to meet with Vice-President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor Condaleeza Rice to talk energy. Tymoshenko became rich as an executive at a natural gas company.</p>
<p>Ukraine was being plugged into Cheney’s crooked Energy Policy Task Force, which opened the planet to unregulated oil &amp; gas exploration, including fracking. Tymoshenko privatized over 300 state industries during her reign,</p>
<p>But the Ukrainian people smelled a rat.</p>
<p>In 2010 they voted in Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych with 48% of the vote. His Party of Regions again defeated Tymoshenko’s Fatherland Party in parliamentary elections of 2012.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko was convicted of embezzlement of state funds and abuse of power. She was given a seven year prison sentence and fined $188 million. The crimes occurred in the natural gas sector.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Tymoshenko was released from prison as part of a deal hatched at a secret meeting between Yanukovych, EU, NATO and Russian officials first reported by William Engdahl in an article for <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/02/27/the-rape-of-ukraine-phase-two-begins/">Veterans Today</a>. Soon after her release all hell broke loose.</p>
<p><b>Mossad’s Fascist Friends</b></p>
<p>On February 22nd snipers opened fire from rooftops on Kiev’s square. Engdahl says these snipers were members of a far-right fascist terror cell known as Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People’s Self Defense (UNA-UNSO).</p>
<p>Led by Andriy Shkil, the group has ties to the neo-Nazi German National Democratic Party. According the Engdahl’s intelligence sources UNA-UNSO is part of a secret NATO Gladio cell and was involved in conflicts ranging from Georgia to Kosovo to Chechnya as part of a strategy of tension aimed at Russia.</p>
<p>Shkil also has direct ties to Tymoshenko, as does newly installed Prime Minster Oleksandr Turchynov, a Baptist preacher and former Tymoshenko advisor who took over after Yanukovych fled under threat to his life to Russia.</p>
<p>In 2006 state prosecutors opened a criminal case against Turchynov, who was accused of destroying files which showed Tymoshenko’s ties to organized crime boss Semion Mogilevich. With Turchynov as Prime Minister Ukraine is now under the thumb of fascist organized criminals known collectively as Right Sector.</p>
<p>It came as no surprise then, when <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/03/01/352724/israeli-army-vet-led-kiev-militia-unit/">Press TV</a> reported that both <i>Haaretz</i> and the <i>Times of Israel</i> openly bragged of how a group of “former” Israeli soldiers known as the Blue Helmets of the Maidan had led the “protesters” in Kiev’s square under the leadership of a man code-named Delta. According to <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/02/17/us-eu-paying-ukrainian-rioters-protesters-paul-craig-roberts/">Paul Craig Roberts</a>, these “protestors” were also being paid by the EU and US.</p>
<p>A Mossad coup brought Right Sector to power, pushing aside more moderate voices being funded and backed by the US, as revealed in the now-infamous YouTube video showing Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland discussing with US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt (both Israeli assets within the State Department) who they would want to install as Ukrainian Prime Minster once they got rid of Yanukovych.</p>
<p><b>A Resource Grab</b></p>
<p>As usual this Rothschild-led bankster <i>putsch</i> is all about resources. Ukraine lies in a highly strategic geographic location, fronting both the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Ukraine is the bread basket of the Eastern Hemisphere. In 2011 it was the world’s 3rd largest grain exporter. It ranks in the top 10 countries in the world for sought-after farmland.</p>
<p>Ukraine has the 2nd largest military in Europe after Russia and the NATO Rothschild tool would love nothing better than to run out the<a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/analysts-black-sea-port-in-ukraine-still-key-to-russia-s-naval-interests-1.270904">Russian Black Sea Fleet</a> at Sevastopol – a symbol of Russian naval power since the 18th century.</p>
<p>Ukraine has vast natural gas deposits, an advanced industrial base and is a highly strategic crossroads for oil &amp; gas pipelines connecting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Their-Bankers-Persian-Gulf/dp/1453757732">Four Horsemen</a> Caspian Sea energy fields with European consumers. In 2009 a dispute between Putin and Tymoshenko over Russia’s trans-Ukrainian gas supplies caused a huge spike in gas prices in Europe.</p>
<p>In October 2013 the IMF met with Ukrainian officials to discuss the country’s alleged “budget crisis”. The bankster enforcer arm demanded that Ukraine double consumer prices for natural gas and electricity, devalue its currency, slash state funding for schools and the elderly, and lift a ban on the sale of its rich farmland to foreigners. In return for this Ukraine was promised a measly $4 billion.</p>
<p>Yanukovych told the IMF to take a hike and Russia soon stepped in promising <i>cheaper</i> energy and stating it would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian bonds. Yanukovych was now on the bankster hit list, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Russia has responded to the Ukrainian coup by sending troops into the Crimea to protect its mostly Russian-speaking population and the Black Sea Fleet. It was here 160 years ago where Catherine the Great launched a major campaign to seize the Crimea from Ottoman sultans.</p>
<p>During WWII ethnic Tatars in Crimea collaborated with Hitler in seizing the region briefly, before Stalin routed them and expelled the Tatar separatists. Many have since returned.</p>
<p>As this drama unfolds, look for the banksters’ Western media tool to make up some “humanitarian crisis” involving the Tatars. There will be more trouble in Crimea.</p>
<p>But the Russians have responded swiftly, as has the alternative media. It ain’t like the good old days, where bankster coups went unquestioned and unnoticed. The Ukrainian people will not stand for these fascists for long either. They saw the empty promises brought forth by the last bankster “event”- the Orange Revolution. They have experience in the field.</p>
<p>The demonic City of London <i>Illuminati</i> banksters may have unlimited time and money. But the people are awakening. The human spirit has unlimited potential. We are much closer to the beginning of this story than to the end.</p>

<p>Corporatocracy is distinctly the dominate practice when it comes to doing business with the federal government. The once embryonic relationships between favored companies and agency bureaucrats, have germinated into distinctive hybrid organisms. Grafting into self-generating species resistant and virtually immune from pest control methods can be found in every area of government expenditures. The big daddy of cozy dealing is that preverbal military-industrial-security complex.</p>
<p>Who can forget all the government money spent in Iraq and Afghanistan that went to favored corporations with no bid contracts? A prime example of this practice is the notorious Cheney affiliated company, <a href="http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/308-12/16561-focus-cheneys-halliburton-made-395-billion-on-iraq-war">Halliburton Made $39.5 Billion on Iraq War</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the level of corruption by defense contractors may be as high as $60 billion. Disciplined soldiers that would traditionally do many of the tasks are commissioned by private and publicly listed companies.</p>
<p>Even without the graft, the costs of paying for these services are higher than paying government employees or soldiers to do them because of the profit motive involved. No-bid contracting &#8211; when companies get to name their price with no competing bid &#8211; didn&#8217;t lower legitimate expenses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SJOkdZTHP7Q" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this sum is merely chump change when compared to the video report that <a href="http://youtu.be/SJOkdZTHP7Q">Rumsfeld Announces $2.3 Trillion Missing from Pentagon</a>. It is one thing to provide contracts to buddy companies, but it quite a different and an outrageous matter to abandon even the appearance of accounting audits of public funds.</p>
<p>Even with this scandal conveniently absent from a much needed accountability the pattern of crony capitalism continues. The left leaning, Center for Public Integrity provides the following stats in <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2011/08/29/5989/windfalls-war-pentagons-no-bid-contracts-triple-10-years-war">Windfalls of war: Pentagon&#8217;s no-bid contracts triple in 10 years of war</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Noncompetitive, sole-source contracts are by no means unique to the Pentagon. Other agencies have been accused of giving short shrift to competition, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which awarded over half of its immediate post-Hurricane Katrina contracts without full competition, according to one congressional report. But based on total dollars, the Pentagon, according to publicly available data analyzed <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/authors/iwatch-news">by iWatch News</a>, lags behind all other major departments in competitive contracting. The Pentagon&#8217;s competition rate of about 61 percent places it will below other agencies. The State Department in 2010 competed almost 75 percent of its contract dollars, the Department of Homeland Security competed almost 77 percent, and the Energy Department competed 94 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The NeoCon publication Newsmax in <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/US/Obama-administration-no-bid-contracts/2013/11/13/id/536496">No-Bid Contracts Mark Obama Administration</a>, cites recent figures below, as the Obama, friendly Huffington Press admits the same in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/no-bid-contracts-obama_n_2899980.html">No-Bid Contracts Jump 9 Percent Under Obama</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Federal agencies awarded $115.2 billion in no-bid contracts in fiscal 2012, an 8.9 percent increase from $105.8 billion in 2009, even as total contract spending decreased by 5 percent during the period.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Citing the absurdity of these abuses, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/12/A-Sweetheart-No-Bid-Contract-for-Obama-Connected-Marketing-Firm">USDA Gives No-Bid Contract to Obama-Connected Marketing Firm</a>, dares expose the wife’s pet projects of Il Duce Obama.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to (FOIA) documents, &#8220;the USDA awarded SS+K the &#8220;unauthorized commitment,&#8221; no-bid contract to produce the &#8220;<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2013/11/obama-tied-firm-got-100k-to-create-michelles-lets-move-logo/">Let’s Move</a>&#8221; logo, slogan, and artwork for Michelle Obama’s campaign, as well as the creative design for the &#8220;Let’s Move&#8221; website, which right now features characters from the Muppets as well as photos of Michelle Obama dancing/exercising.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, the look of arrogant favoritism is seen when a <a href="http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/10/29/hannity-krauthammer-michelle-obamas-connection-obamacare-no-bid-contract">First Lady&#8217;s College Classmate Linked to No-Bid ObamaCare Contract</a> produced the latest failure of governmental competency.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A former Princeton classmate of First Lady Michelle Obama is a senior executive <a href="http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/10/24/video-highlights-house-lawmakers-grill-contractors-over-obamacare-website-debacle">at CGI Federal</a>, a company that received a no-bid government contract to set up the ObamaCare website, according to reports <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/28/michelle-obama-and-cgi-federal-executive-belonged-to-student-group-at-princeton-that-hosted-pro-terrorist-speaker/">by the Daily Caller</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas Lifson notes in the essay, <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2013/11/unbelievable_incompetence_led_to_no-bid_contract_for_healthcaregov.html">Unbelievable incompetence led to no-bid contract for healthcare.gov</a>, a very important point. &#8220;Any company which screwed up a key product introduction this badly would fire its chief executive. It&#8217;s a shame the same remedy does not apply in the public sector.&#8221;The political class operates on a continuous need of acquiring an ever increasing level of cash flow. Elected politicians rely upon the donations (translate BRIBES) from their corporate or special interest patrons. Bureaucratic officials maintain and increase their power with expanding the role of their agencies that demand ever-bigger budgets.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no incentive to stop the no bid gravy train as the embattled citizen taxpayers are fleeced with each new overrun contract. However, in an era of permanent budget deficits, monetizing the debt is far more attractive than actually balancing expenditures with real dollar taxes.</p>
<p>Bipartisan acquiescence to this fascist model for pillaging the national treasury is an incontrovertible fact of this continuation of abuses. Then again, the more accurate interpretation is that the entire system is based upon a dishonest culture of perpetual graft and self-enrichment.</p>
<p>Reciprocal preferential treatment is at the core of business dealing with government authorities. No bid contracts are guarantee centers of the funny money circus.</p>
<p>In the article, <a href="http://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/how-to-make-billions-off-government-contracts/4813">How to Make Billions Off Government Contracts</a>, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) references the following.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Noncompetitive contracting, cost-reimbursement contracts, and time-and-materials and labor-hour (T&amp;M/LH) contracts pose special risks of overspending.</p>
<p>Non-competitive contracts present a risk because there is not a direct market mechanism for setting the contract price. Cost-reimbursement contracts and T&amp;M/LH contracts pose a risk because they provide no direct incentive to the contractor for cost control.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>These systemic problems are even more pronounced with no bid contracts. The lack of comparative pricing is understood by honorable public servants. Nonetheless, the political prostitutes that cook up the sweet heart deals and administer the payoffs are components of the wicked corporatocracy/state alliance.</p>
<p>Benito Mussolini explained that &#8220;Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power&#8221;, he is really describing the current functions of today’s establishment.</p>
<p>No bid contracts means a particular company is preapproved to rip off the system. With their governmental partners, the fix is set for splitting the spoils. Welcome to the state/capitalism matrix in the 21th century.</p>

<p>There comes a time when a coming convergence becomes apparent. But when it spells a very probable major cataclysm people are not too eager to see it.</p>
<p>But see it we must. And sound the alarm we must…as well as prepare.</p>
<p>Funny how that’s another thing “they” minimize and belittle. “Conspiracy freak” leads into “gloom and doomer”, “fear and hate monger” etc., all being cleverly wrapped into the “terrorist” catch-all these fascist, police state days.</p>
<p>They are the authors and manufacturers of terror, always accusing the very ones they’re murdering and manipulating. Sadly, the snooze button has been hit seemingly permanently for some. Nothing rattles them anymore – until the food runs out.</p>
<p>The wake up will hit, one way or another. It’s already happened for very many. The key is to be awake, aware and ready.</p>
<h4>Our Surreal News</h4>
<p>With multiple extremely serious realities striking home from a possible banking shutdown to Fukushima to martial law and beyond there are more and more people who are catching on. But the hour is late.</p>
<p>That’s not to mention concurrent massive geo-engineering and weather manipulation.</p>
<p>Shrimping was finally banned off the Gulf of Mexico due to horrific deformities and lesions in specimens being found; the arrival of radioactive Japan tsunami debris and massive radiated levels in the Pacific showing high readings in fish and algae and other samples and now even beach conditions on the US west coast; growing concerns about “fracking” causing earthquakes and severe water pollution around the world; GMO toxins and vaccines now known to not only maim humanity but drastically reduce fertility – are all major ongoing concerns that are adding up and causing people to boil over.</p>
<p>And that doesn’t touch on the economic and corporate manipulations, the police state crackdowns, and the massive war machine that’s gobbling up the world with hardly a peep of resistance or protest.</p>
<p>Something’s seriously amiss. And that’s just a sampling.</p>
<p>All of these man made anomalies are outrageous. And of course under or non-reported. And the Fukushima mutation weirdness has hardly begun with the millions of tons of nuclear contaminated water being continually, and dutifully I might add, dumped off of Japan.</p>
<p>The mutations and die-offs have started, but just barely. And as our forests and crops fail from aluminum and barium poisoning from our chemtrail poisoned skies you can be sure it will get very distressing as the days and weeks progress, as evidenced by California’s severe drought that will have devastating repercussions.</p>
<h4>The World’s Been Thoroughly Conned…and Set Up</h4>
<p>You’d think everyone would start to realize something serious is actually going down. But most can’t begin to fathom the degree to which we’re being attacked. It’s way too horrific to grasp, never mind fully realize and integrate into their lives.</p>
<p>If just one spent fuel rod pool at Fukushima collapses, there will be so much plutonium-based radiation released it would be called a potential Extinction Level Event (ELE). Just that. And if that doesn’t “bake your noodle”, do you know how many hundreds of these types of old dangerous fuel rod pool stocked reactors there are around the world?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/n/nuclear-power-plant-world-wide.htm">Over 800</a>! And all those, built in the 60′s and 70′s, are now due for “expiration”! Never mind the plethora of nuclear bomb manufacturing facilities in the US and around the world. We’re talking insane, people. And most of us had nothing to do with any of this. At least not consciously.</p>
<p>This planet is one large deliberately bomb-ridden Murrah Building or explosive-laden Twin Tower. Earth has been and is being engineered for demolition, whether a man-made or natural disaster triggers it, the charges have been thoroughly and deliberately set in place.</p>
<p>Waiting around and living “business as usual” are no longer options.</p>
<h4>The Virtue of Knowledge</h4>
<p>This doesn’t have to spell the end of everything, as awful as that sounds. People who love you tell you the Truth.</p>
<p>I’m fully convinced that our number one job here is to wake up, first and foremost, individually, and then wake up everyone around us. It’s imperative people see the vast extent of the perfidy of this parasitic force destroying our planet. And that’s not an easy task…UNTIL someone wakes up! Once the light gets in all will follow to the True in Heart.</p>
<p>The coming cataclysms, in whatever form they take, will work in Truth’s favor. Universe doesn’t fail in anything within any of its realms. How it plays out here is only perceived from our small, limited viewpoint. We will learn, come what may.</p>
<p>But the viewpoint from the heart?!….that’s where the answers reside. All we have to do is listen. And learn. And do.</p>
<h4>False Flag Earth and the Plan of the War gods</h4>
<p>Anyone reading this knows false flags have been perpetrated by rulers since time immemorial. It’s virtually primordial evil to secretly do some evil deed yourself or have someone do it for you and blame someone else, all for a desired effect.</p>
<p>This huge scam is admittedly off the charts wrong and engineered by the dark side, however you perceive it. The loving and kind-hearted would never consider such acts, which is why many can’t conceive them, yet the controllers use these tactics with abandon.</p>
<p>Earth will survive their puny efforts in some form, if need be. Humanity may not, at least here, until the earth recovers or we take off for new horizons. I don’t know. But to deliberately bring on such catastrophic conditions is not an easy one for the lay unaware earth man to wrap his head around. Very strange indeed, but that’s how they’ve gotten away with it.</p>
<p>They say mega catastrophes, natural and perhaps otherwise, have wiped out previous civilizations and thousands of animal species on earth. They’ve even found evidence of a nuclear conflagration in ancient India, and it’s theorized Atlantis and Lemuria had it out in some sort of nuclear war and that’s how they came to an end.</p>
<p>It seems these warlike “gods” through the ages have a propensity for this type of wanton death-dealing and destruction. They really should find their own already decimated rock somewhere out there and fight it out between themselves and leave us the hell alone.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t you say?</p>
<h4>Non Cooperation and Resistance is Essential</h4>
<p>Our job is to first wake up to the horrific reality that we’re being deliberately killed off, and then wake up as many others as possible. I don’t know about any cavalry coming to save us but I do know it’s a time of energetic change that will help more and more see what’s going on and hopefully wake up out of slumber.</p>
<p>And when we activate, Universe activates. And I don’t doubt there aren’t “agents of good” who help us from other realms. When we put feet to our new found knowledge things on every level activate. But the responsibility is ours. It will always remain ours. That’s the cycle we’re on. If you don’t get it and respond you’re doomed to repeat it till you do..in one form or another. To me that makes total sense. But then again, I’m just wondering…</p>
<p>The Universe is intrinsically right and just. If we didn’t have free will life would be a drag. And with free will comes a lot of messiness. And responsibility. It’s ours to handle responsibly. Our hearts tell us so.</p>
<p>So let’s enjoy this anyway! But let’s get Love and Truth back in charge here, shall we?</p>
<h4>Perspective – They Can’t Win Over Truth and Love</h4>
<p>You really wonder how these anti-natural freaks can take themselves seriously. Just look at the magnificence of our Universe. It’s beyond description. Clearly forces play out that we’re only slightly aware of. But one thing we can be sure of…puny man or any other power-crazed entity is nothing to be feared. We’re inter connected with Something so much greater and profound we can rest assured all will come out for the better no matter what happens in the short term.</p>
<p>The current awakening is changing the entire dynamic on our planet by the hour. The matrix is coming down, which is why they’re so frantically trying to slap up structural supports for it everywhere with more laws and draconian regulations. There’s a vibrational change that is exposing the Truth and accelerating drastic life changes all around us. This will no doubt change the course of all of their plans as everyone’s perceptions will be changing as well.</p>
<h4>Eternity Rules</h4>
<p>If we’re on to their scam, we should identify it, non-comply and rise up in defiance of it and overcome it. Whatever form we take. Even if the whole place blows, you think that’s the end?</p>
<p>Fear of death is possibly the biggest con going. How many parallel dimensional worlds are right now spinning, slipping and sliding around us? Even our so called big brained physicists say at least 11. You think that’s all? (And btw, notice no one’s calling <strong>them</strong>conspiracy freaks! Ha!)</p>
<p>The biggest lesson we can all learn: Heart trumps brain trumps programming.</p>
<p>Stick to your convictions, come what may.</p>
<p>And go with the flow – synchronicity leads and confirms and encourages.</p>
<p>A final thought from Lao Tzu…</p>
<p><strong><em>“A good traveler has no fixed plan, and is not intent on arriving.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Keep wondering.</p>
<p>Love, Zen</p>

<p><i>Can the sharing economy movement address the root causes of the world’s converging crises? Unless the sharing of resources is promoted in relation to human rights and concerns for equity, democracy, social justice and sustainability, then such claims are without substantiation – although there are many hopeful signs that the conversation is slowly moving in the right direction. </i></p>
<p>In recent years, the concept and practice of sharing resources is fast becoming a mainstream phenomenon across North America, Western Europe and other world regions. The internet is awash with articles and websites that celebrate the vast potential of sharing human and physical assets, in everything from cars and bicycles to housing, workplaces, food, household items, and even time or expertise. According to most general definitions that are widely available online, the sharing economy leverages information technology to empower individuals or organisations to distribute, share and re-use excess capacity in goods and services. The business icons of the new sharing economy include the likes of Airbnb, Zipcar, Lyft, Taskrabbit and Poshmark, although <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpiper2.bluematrix.com%2Fdocs%2Fpdf%2F35ef1fcc-a07b-48cf-ab80-04d80e5665c4.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGekCdy-Vx93Kz9oCrjPbnxD8z7qw" target="_blank">hundreds of other</a> for-profit as well as non-profit organisations are associated with this burgeoning movement that is predicated, in one way or another, on the age-old principle of sharing.</p>
<p>As the sharing economy receives increasing attention from the media, a debate is beginning to emerge around its overall importance and future direction. There is no doubt that the emergent paradigm of sharing resources is set to expand and further flourish in coming years, especially in the face of continuing economic recession, government austerity and environmental concerns. As a result of the concerted advocacy work and mobilisation of sharing groups in the US, fifteen city mayors have now signed the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.collaborativeconsumption.com%2F2013%2F06%2F26%2Fshareable-cities-resolution-passed%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJr9YIvK0tVE5nEO6CLmeSiV9nqw" target="_blank">Shareable Cities Resolution</a> in which they officially recognise the importance of economic sharing for both the public and private sectors. Seoul in South Korea has also adopted a city-funded project called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.postcarbon.org%2Fblog-post%2F1949822-who-knew-that-seoul-was-a&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtjQqJ3iJS_iKEX2lhPnmhCoQRog" target="_blank">Sharing City</a> in which it plans to expand its ‘sharing infrastructure’, promote existing sharing enterprises and incubate sharing economy start-ups as a partial solution to problems in housing, transportation, job creation and community cohesion. Furthermore, Medellin in Colombia is embracing transport-sharing schemes and reimagining the use of its shared public spaces, while Ecuador is the first country in the world to commit itself to becoming a ‘shared knowledge’-based society, under an <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbollier.org%2Fblog%2Fbauwens-joins-ecuador-planning-commons-based-peer-production-economy&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGhTIStm9OM2sUoHkNNXqo40Ma0Lw" target="_blank">official strategy</a> named ‘buen saber’.</p>
<p>Many proponents of the sharing economy therefore have <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesolutionsjournal.org%2Fnode%2F24124&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9vDnCD36x_oEPvOy3gKsP2Hy6hQ" target="_blank">great hopes</a> for a future based on sharing as the new <em>modus operandi</em>. Almost everyone recognises that drastic change is needed in the wake of a collapsed economy and an overstretched planet, and the old idea of the American dream – in which a culture that promotes excessive consumerism and commercialisation leads us to see the &#8216;good life&#8217; as the &#8216;goods life&#8217;, as described by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGab38pKscw" target="_blank">psychologist Tim Kasser</a> - is no longer tenable in a world of rising affluence among possibly 9.6 billion people by 2050. Hence more and more people are rejecting the materialistic attitudes that defined recent decades, and are gradually shifting towards a different way of living that is based on connectedness and sharing rather than ownership and conspicuous consumption. ‘Sharing more and owning less’ is the ethic that underlies a discernible change in attitudes among affluent society that is being led by today’s young, tech-savvy generation known as Generation Y or the Millennials.</p>
<p>However, many entrepreneurial sharing pioneers also profess a big picture vision of what sharing can achieve in relation to the world’s most pressing issues, such as population growth, environmental degradation and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharing.org%2Finformation-centre%2Fblogs%2Fcan-sharing-economy-solve-global-hunger-it-all-depends&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBqlUrAoI-KHdEMOVocQHvbemkXg" target="_blank">food security</a>. As <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shareable.net%2Fblog%2Ffrom-consumers-to-citizens-welcome-to-the-sharing-cities-network&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHw8rH-2YOfy-9eygKI2dNDyAGzgA" target="_blank">Ryan Gourley of A2Share</a> posits, for example, a network of cities that embrace the sharing economy could mount up into a Sharing Regions Network, then Sharing Nations, and finally a Sharing World: “A globally networked sharing economy would be a whole new paradigm, a game-changer for humanity and the planet”. Neal Gorenflo, the co-founder and publisher of Shareable, also argues that peer-to-peer collaboration can form the basis of a new social contract, with an extensive sharing movement acting as the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shareable.net%2Fblog%2Fwhats-next-for-the-sharing-movement&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnBJgdSsVGV91WF6JQYJGFIQVNPg" target="_blank">catalyst for systemic changes</a>that can address the root causes of both poverty and climate change. Or to quote the words of Benita Matofska, founder of The People Who Share, we are going to have to &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foe.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fthepeoplewhoshare_38689&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYJuCz1IwZAr87WNQ1ntqPsEDkFw" target="_blank">share to survive</a>&#8221; if we want to face up to a sustainable future. In such a light, it behoves us all to investigate the potential of sharing to effect a social and economic transformation that is sufficient to meet the grave challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<h3><strong>Two sides of a debate on sharing</strong></h3>
<p>There is no doubt that sharing resources can contribute to the greater good in a number of ways, from economic as well as environmental and social perspectives. A number of studies show the environmental benefits that are common to many sharing schemes, such as the resource efficiency and potential energy savings that could result from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uctc.net%2Faccess%2F38%2Faccess38_carsharing_ownership.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFb0OU-7XGQphUN6FCBQOr9HtbYAw" target="_blank">car sharing</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nlc.org%2FDocuments%2FFind%2520City%2520Solutions%2FResearch%2520Innovation%2FSustainability%2Fintegrating-bike-share-programs-into-sustainable-transportation-system-cpb-feb11.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFREPVRcj7FAb38yYKFAbM9mJB-Ng" target="_blank">bike sharing</a> in cities.

<p>Few could disagree on these beneficial aspects of sharing resources within communities or across municipalities, but some controversy surrounds the broader vision of how the sharing economy movement can contribute to a fair and sustainable world. For many advocates of the burgeoning trend towards economic sharing in modern cities, it is about much more than couch-surfing, car sharing or tool libraries, and holds the potential to disrupt the individualist and materialistic assumptions of neoliberal capitalism. For example, Juliet Schor in her book <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FPlenitude-The-Economics-True-Wealth%2Fdp%2F1400167337%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1390301781%26sr%3D8-2%26keywords%3Dplenitude&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEo_wBpemJL_zqOoGN66mU6vO4sQg" target="_blank">Plenitude</a> perceives that a new economics based on sharing could be an antidote to the hyper-individualised, hyper-consumer culture of today, and could help rebuild the social ties that have been lost through market culture. Annie Leonard of the Story of Stuff project, in her <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstoryofstuff.org%2Fmovies%2Fthe-story-of-solutions%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWjwMb_olIMl2-3Z6bM4LG01FzJQ" target="_blank">latest short video</a> on how to move society in an environmentally sustainable and just direction, also considers sharing as a key ‘game changing’ solution that could help to transform the basic goals of the economy.</p>
<p>Many <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.resilience.org%2Fstories%2F2013-09-11%2Fpolicies-for-shareable-cities-a-sharing-economy-policy-primer-for-urban-leaders&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuhYqqb2G31ebifG50SX-WNtu5Jg" target="_blank">other proponents</a> see the sharing economy as a path towards achieving widespread prosperity within the earth’s natural limits, and an essential first step on the road to more localised economies and egalitarian societies. But far from everyone perceives that participating in the sharing economy, at least in its existing form and praxis, is a ‘political act’ that can realistically challenge consumption-driven economics and the culture of individualism – a question that is raised (although not yet comprehensively answered) in a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foe.co.uk%2Fbigideas%2Fthink_piece_cities_sharing_41208.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBpYAnx6S7QFgkHbF9B7gOBKRqZg" target="_blank">valuable think piece</a> from Friends of the Earth, as discussed further below. Various commentators argue that the proliferation of new business ventures under the umbrella of sharing are nothing more than “supply and demand continuing its perpetual adjustment to new technologies and fresh opportunities”, and that the concept of the sharing economy is being <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shareable.net%2Fblog%2Fsharing-for-profit-im-not-buying-it-anymore&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNERt3WSbzORUD4k0YTTmutIhpiAmA" target="_blank">co-opted by purely commercial interests</a> – a debate that was given impetus when the car sharing pioneers, Zipcar, were bought up by the established rental firm Avis.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slate.com%2Fblogs%2Fmoneybox%2F2013%2F12%2F26%2Fmyth_of_the_sharing_economy_there_s_no_such_thing.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQPBqyxdhEcHliK0hrJkZvFiLc-g" target="_blank">Slate magazine’s</a> business and economics correspondent controversially reiterated the observation that making money from new modes of consumption is not really ‘sharing’ <em>per se</em>, asserting that the sharing economy is therefore a “dumb term” that “deserves to die”. Other journalists have criticised the superficial treatment that the sharing economy typically receives from financial pundits and tech reporters, especially the claims that small business start-ups based on monetised forms of sharing are a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2014%2Fjan%2F07%2Fsharing-economy-not-solution-to-jobs-crisis&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYkhQS6a-wvBdqNx4tmsndOYmbAw" target="_blank">solution to the jobs crisis</a> – regardless of drastic cutbacks in welfare and public services, unprecedented rates of income inequality, and the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.policy-network.net%2Fpno_detail.aspx%3FID%3D4004%26title%3D%2BThe%2BPrecariat%2B%25E2%2580%2593%2BThe%2Bnew%2Bdangerous%2Bclass&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEEXahBizmgFZjUyLg76z81qZ6lQQ" target="_blank">dangerous rise of the precariat</a>. The author Evgeny Morozov, writing an <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fevgenymorozov.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F64038831400%2Fthe-sharing-economy-undermines-workers-rights-my&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDWAwBqhfPbJ6dKcO7H_C2W7bB8w" target="_blank">op-ed in the Financial Times</a>, has gone as far as saying that the sharing economy is having a pernicious effect on equality and basic working conditions, in that it is fully compliant with market logic, is far from valuing human relationships over profit, and is even amplifying the worst excesses of the dominant economic model. In the context of the erosion of full-time employment, the assault on trade unions and the disappearance of healthcare and insurance benefits, he argues that the sharing economy is accelerating the transformation of workers into “always-on self-employed entrepreneurs who must think like brands”, leading him to dub it “neoliberalism on steroids”.</p>
<h3><strong>Problems of definition</strong></h3>
<p>Although it is impossible to reconcile these polarised views, part of the problem in assessing the true potential of economic sharing is one of vagueness in definition and wide differences in understanding. The conventional interpretation of the sharing economy is at present focused on its financial and commercial aspects, with continuous news reports proclaiming its <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fopinium.co.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FOpinium_Marke2ing_Sharing_economy_Report.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwjgoJG1HNrv_xDQx5Asdc2AJuiQ" target="_blank">rapidly growing market size</a> and potential as a “co-commerce revolution”. Rachel Botsman, a leading entrepreneurial thinker on the potential of collaboration and sharing through digital technologies to change our lives, has attempted to clarify what the sharing economy actually is in order to prevent further confusion over the different terms in general use. In her <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcoexist.com%2F3022028%2Fthe-sharing-economy-lacks-a-shared-definition%236&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXQ_oD_qFknLQ69LdN5HZWNVbntQ" target="_blank">latest typology</a>, she notes how the term ‘sharing economy’ is often muddled with other new ideas and is in fact a subset of &#8216;collaborative consumption&#8217; within the entire &#8216;collaborative economy&#8217; movement, and has a rather restricted meaning in terms of &#8220;sharing underutilized assets from spaces to skills to stuff for monetary or non-monetary benefits&#8221; [see <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FCollabLab%2Fshared-def-pptf%3Fref%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcoexist.com%2F3022028%2Fthe-sharing-economy-lacks-a-shared-definition&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzSRZF_pU7j3DuPReRe0uKCi-m4w" target="_blank">slide 9</a> of the presentation]. This interpretation of changing consumer behaviours and lifestyles revolves around the “maximum utilization of assets through efficient models of redistribution and shared access”, which isn’t necessarily predicated on an ethic of ‘sharing’ by any strict definition.</p>
<p>Other interpretations of the sharing economy are far broader and less constrained by capitalistic assumptions, as demonstrated in the Friends of the Earth briefing paper on <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foe.co.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fdownloads%2Fagyeman_sharing_cities.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExW9YNZU6pNwVXQ1jq8_2BH2jB6g" target="_blank">Sharing Cities</a> written by Professor Julian Agyeman et al. In their estimation, what’s missing from most of these current definitions and categorisations of economic sharing is a consideration of “the communal, collective production that characterises the collective commons”. A broadened ‘sharing spectrum’ that they propose therefore not only focuses on goods and services within the mainstream economy (which is almost always considered in relation to affluent, middle-class lifestyles), but also includes the non-material or intangible aspects of sharing such as well-being and capability [see <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foe.co.uk%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fdownloads%2Fagyeman_sharing_cities.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExW9YNZU6pNwVXQ1jq8_2BH2jB6g" target="_blank">page 6</a> of the brief]. From this wider perspective, they assert that the cutting edge of the sharing economy is often <em>not</em> commercial and includes informal behaviours like the unpaid care, support and nurturing that we provide for one another, as well as the shared use of infrastructure and shared public services.</p>
<p>This sheds a new light on governments as the “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rsablogs.org.uk%2F2013%2Fsocial-economy%2Fprofiting-sharing%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGB7G1m6oimR8EDN2W8RFAA2O4CdQ" target="_blank">ultimate level of sharing</a>”, and suggests that the history of the welfare state in Europe and other forms of social protection is, in fact, also integral to the evolution of shared resources in cities and within different countries. Yet an understanding of sharing from this more holistic viewpoint doesn’t have to be limited to the state provision of healthcare, education, and other public services. As Agyeman et al elucidate, cooperatives of all kinds (from worker to housing to retailer and consumer co-ops) also offer alternative models for shared service provision and a different perspective on economic sharing, one in which equity and collective ownership is prioritised. Access to natural common resources such as air and water can also be understood in terms of sharing, which may then prioritise the common good of all people over commercial or private interests and market mechanisms. This would include controversial issues of land ownership and land use, raising questions over how best to share land and urban space more equitably – such as through community land trusts, or through new policies and incentives such as land value taxation.</p>
<h3><strong>The politics of sharing</strong></h3>
<p>Furthermore, Agyeman et al argue that an understanding of sharing in relation to the collective commons gives rise to explicitly political questions concerning the shared public realm and participatory democracy. This is central to the many countercultural movements of recent years (such as the Occupy movement and Middle East protests since 2011, and the Taksim Gezi Park protests in 2013) that have reclaimed public space to symbolically challenge unjust power dynamics and the increasing trend toward privatisation that is central to neoliberal hegemony. Sharing is also directly related to the functioning of a healthy democracy, the authors reason, in that a vibrant sharing economy (when interpreted in this light) can counter the political apathy that characterises modern consumer society. By reinforcing values of community and collaboration over the individualism and consumerism that defines our present-day cultures and identities, they argue that participation in sharing could ultimately be reflected in the political domain. They also argue that a shared public realm is essential for the expression of participatory democracy and the development of a good society, not least as this provides a necessary venue for popular debate and public reasoning that can influence political decisions. Indeed the “emerging shareability paradigm”, as they describe it, is said to reflect the basic tenets of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftint.org%2F2011%2F10%2Fworld-charter-for-the-right-to-the-city%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDM6Up4O9FpticjkMjg5itoXx2Aw" target="_blank">Right to the City</a> (RTTC) &#8211; an international urban movement that fights for democracy, justice and sustainability in cities and mobilises against the privatisation of common goods and public spaces.</p>
<p>The intention in briefly outlining some of these differing interpretations of sharing is to demonstrate how considerations of politics, justice, ethics and sustainability are slowly being allied with the sharing economy concept. A paramount example is the Friends of the Earth briefing paper outlined above, which was written as part of FOEI’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foe.co.uk%2Fbigideas%2Fbig_ideas_cities_40237.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtT_-Bsi3rw3Ebu2Pww7C45-dbOA" target="_blank">Big Ideas to Change the World</a> series on cities that promoted sharing as “a political force to be reckoned with” and a “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shareable.net%2Fblog%2Fthe-power-of-sharing-a-call-to-action-for-environmentalists%3Futm_content%3Dadam%2540stwr.org%26utm_source%3DVerticalResponse%26utm_medium%3DEmail%26utm_term%3DSharing%253A%2520A%2520Call%2520to%2520Action%2520for%2520Environmentalists%26utm_campaign%3DShareable%253A%2520Global%2520Sharing%2520Ramps%2520Up%2520During%2520Shutdowncontent&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHR7vgGV5E2NQJqI41uz71aRAgGGg" target="_blank">call to action for environmentalists</a>”. Yet many further examples could also be mentioned, such as the New Economics Foundation’s ‘<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenewmaterialism.org%2Fpamphlet&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRG-dUWiX0xJ_zA-2XSVnJ-HaMHA" target="_blank">Manifesto for the New Materialism</a>’ which promotes the old-fashioned ethic of sharing as part of a new way of living to replace the collapsed model of debt-fuelled overconsumption. There are also signs that many influential proponents of the sharing economy &#8211; as generally understood today in terms of new economic models driven by peer-to-peer technology that enable access to rather than ownership of resources &#8211; are beginning to query the commercial direction that the movement is taking, and are instead promoting more politicised forms of social change that are not merely based on micro-enterprise or the monetisation/branding of high-tech innovations.</p>
<p>Janelle Orsi, a California-based ‘sharing lawyer’ and author of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsharingsolution.com%2Fauthors%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTDY5DSxDJVWe2h8mthmmZhRue9w" target="_blank">The Sharing Solution</a>, is particularly inspirational in this regard; for her, the sharing economy encompasses such a broad range of activities that it is hard to define, although she suggests that all its activities are tied together in how they harness the existing resources of a community and grow its wealth. This is in contradistinction to the mainstream economy that mostly generates wealth for people outside of people’s communities, and inherently generates extreme inequalities and ecological destruction – which Orsi contends that the sharing economy can help reverse. The problem she recognises is that the so-called sharing economy we usually hear about in the media is built upon a business-as-usual foundation, which is privately owned and often funded by venture capital (as is the case with Airbnb, Lyft, Zipcar, Taskrabbit <em>et cetera</em>). As a result, the same business structures that created the economic problems of today are buying up new sharing economy companies and turning them into ever larger, more centralised enterprises that are not concerned about people’s well-being, community cohesion, local economic diversity, sustainable job creation and so on (not to mention the risk of re-creating stock valuation bubbles that overshadowed the earlier generation of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdot.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFCqrICSpx5bAZNc0BT8Mi9MrsSLQ" target="_blank">dot.com</a> enterprises). The only way to ensure that new sharing economy companies fulfil their potential to create economic empowerment for users and their communities, Orsi argues, is through cooperative conversion – and she makes a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shareable.net%2Fblog%2Fthe-sharing-economy-just-got-real&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGczp05zpQSnwmnQ4AtvaSUQeDhzw" target="_blank">compelling case</a> for the democratic, non-exploitative, redistributive and truly ‘sharing’ potential of worker and consumer cooperatives in all their guises.</p>
<h3><strong>Sharing as a path to systemic change</strong></h3>
<p>There are important reasons to query which direction this emerging movement for sharing will take in the years ahead. As prominent supporters of the sharing economy recognise, like Janelle Orsi and Juliet Schor, it offers both opportunities and reasons for optimism as well as pitfalls and some serious concerns. On the one hand, it reflects a growing shift in our values and social identities as ‘citizens vs consumers’, and is helping us to rethink notions of ownership and prosperity in a world of finite resources, scandalous waste and massive wealth disparities. Perhaps its many proponents are right, and the sharing economy represents the first step towards transitioning away from the over-consumptive, materially-intense and hoarding lifestyles of North American, Western European and other rich societies. Perhaps sharing really is fast becoming a counter-cultural movement that can help us to value relationships more than things, and offer us the possibility of re-imagining politics and constructing a more participative democracy, which could ultimately pose a challenge to the global capitalist/consumerist model of development that is built on private interests and debt at the cost of shared interests and true wealth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, critics are right to point out that the sharing economy in its present form is hardly a threat to existing power structures or a movement that represents the kind of radical changes we need to make the world a better place. Far from reorienting the economy towards greater equity and a better quality of life, as proposed by writers such as Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, Tim Jackson, Herman Daly and John Cobb, it is arguable that most forms of sharing via peer-to-peer networks are at risk of being subverted by conventional business practices. There is a perverse irony in trying to imagine the logical conclusion of these trends: new models of collaborative consumption and co-production that are co-opted by private interests and venture capitalists, and increasingly geared towards affluent middle-class types or so-called bourgeois bohemians (the ‘bobos’), to the exclusion of those on low incomes and therefore to the detriment of a more equal society. Or new sharing technology platforms that enable governments and corporations to collaborate in pursuing more intrusive controls over and greater surveillance of citizens. Or new social relationships based on sharing in the context of increasingly privatised and enclosed public spaces, such as gated communities within which private facilities and resources are shared.</p>
<p>This is by no means an inevitable outcome, but what is clear from this brief analysis is that the commercialisation and depoliticisation of economic sharing poses risks and contradictions that call into question its potential to transform society for the benefit of everyone. Unless the sharing of resources is promoted in relation to human rights and concerns for equity, democracy, social justice and sound environmental stewardship, then the various claims that sharing is a new paradigm that can address the world’s interrelated crises is indeed empty rhetoric or utopian thinking without any substantiation. Sharing our skills through Hackerspaces, our unused stuff through GoodShuffle or a community potluck through mealshare is, in and of itself, a generally positive phenomenon that deserves to be enjoyed and fully participated in, but let’s not pretend that car shares, clothes swaps, co-housing, shared vacation homes and so on are going to seriously address economic and climate chaos, unjust power dynamics or inequitable wealth distribution.</p>
<h3><strong>Sharing from the local to the global</strong></h3>
<p>If we look at sharing through the lens of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fjulianagyeman.com%2F2012%2F09%2Fjust-sustainabilities%2F%23hide&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNErJlR497xqBhRmCz12qVchQSiy7Q" target="_blank">just sustainability</a>, however, as civil society organisations and others are now beginning to do, then the true possibilities of sharing resources within and among the world’s nations are vast and all-encompassing: to enhance equity, rebuild community, improve well-being, democratise national and global governance, defend and promote the global commons, even to point the way towards a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kosmosjournal.org%2Farticles%2Fpeople-sharing-resources-toward-a-new-multilateralism-of-the-global-commons&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGs2OqSuUOEZ5JL_68nYO-DoHUplA" target="_blank">more cooperative international framework</a> to replace the present stage of competitive neoliberal globalisation. We are not there yet, of course, and the popular understanding of economic sharing today is clearly focused on the more personal forms of giving and exchange among individuals or through online business ventures, which is mainly for the benefit of high-income groups in the world’s most economically advanced nations. But the fact that this conversation is now being broadened to include the role of governments in sharing public infrastructure, political power and economic resources within countries is a hopeful indication that the emerging sharing movement is slowly moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>Already, questions are being raised as to what sharing resources means for the poorest people in the developing world, and how a revival of economic sharing in the richest countries can be spread globally as a solution to converging crises. It may not be long until the idea of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharing.org%2Fwhy-nations-need-to-share&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHjnHtITgvCNsWAy8PyegDNYU9PA" target="_blank">economic sharing on a planetary scale</a> - driven by an awareness of impending ecological catastrophe, life-threatening extremes of inequality, and escalating conflict over natural resources &#8211; is the subject of every dinner party and kitchen table conversation.</p>

<p>The ideological chains that bind and subdue us are stronger and more effective than any chain forged from steel. These manacles are more freedom inhibiting than a prison cell or solitary confinement. Belief, faith, and hope can imprison as well as liberate us. By the power of suggestion, a thin cotton string can effectively tether an elephant. </p>
<p>Politicians and their associates in the corporate media are master manipulators of language and images. Anytime you hear them speak, think of Plato’s Allegory of the Cave ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave</a>). Virtually everything that we see and hear, nearly everything we have been told, is an officious lie, an illusion created to deceive and control us. The purpose of deception is to promote the dogma and welfare of those in power, while implicitly disempowering those who are being deceived. Language is rarely, if ever, neutral. Coercive ideology lurks behind every sentence. </p>
<p>In a sense, all language is propaganda, even the words on this page. For instance, in this short essay, I declare my intention to lead my readers to a conclusion that I hope will awaken them, promote consciousness, and encourage principled behavior that is conducive to the collective emancipation of the working class. </p>
<p>Our faith in capitalistic institutions promotes the pretense of democracy, while it delivers plutocracy, corporate fascism, and militarism. Similarly, imprudent belief in the American Dream induces people to behave in ways that promote the welfare of those in power rather than the perspectives of those of us struggling to be free. Belief in this discredited notion keeps workers from organizing against their oppressors. </p>

<p>The puppeteers casting shadows on the cave wall know that the images they project are not real. By contrast, the indoctrinated audience interprets the shadows as authentic figures rather than the phantasms they are. The purveyors of mythos and propaganda, the authors of the sanctioned historical narrative that defines reality for the masses, are consciously misleading us. The empowered are aware that we are attempting to navigate a house of mirrors with trap doors, but we continue to believe that the flickering images on the cave wall are real. Interpretation is everything. </p>
<p>Americans believe that we are a free and representative republic, because that is what we have always been told, despite evidence to the contrary. But choosing our oppressors every few years makes us neither free nor democratic. Electoral outcomes that are determined by capital do not give us a real voice in fashioning an equitable economic agenda, taxation, or foreign policy, including decisions about war. Participation in bogus systems of power binds us to delusions and keeps us ideologically imprisoned. They prevent us from taking meaningful action. </p>
<p>In America, working people are excluded from all of the important decisions that profoundly affect their lives. Legislators at all levels of government are beholden to the corporations and wealthy individuals who fund their campaigns. To the power elite, “we the people” are little more than background noise to be tuned out. </p>
<p>Cast a stone at the mirrors and the illusion immediately dissolves into shards of broken glass. A perplexing chain reaction is set in motion; worlds fall like rows of dominoes and fill the vacuum vacated by appearance with new images, new ideas, and new possibilities. Polaris abruptly appears with the stars of Ursa Minor wrapped around her like a jeweled necklace glistening in the velvet black darkness of eternal night. She was always there but concealed behind striated walls of silvered glass in the great American funhouse of lies and delusion we call reality. </p>

<p>Bearing the Allegory of the Cave in mind, consider this: If a worker puts his faith in an economic system that exploits and alienates him, his faith shackles rather than liberates him. Correspondingly, if a man believes that his oppressor is his liberator or protector, he ideologically imprisons himself and promotes behavior that benefits and strengthens his tormentor rather than himself or his socioeconomic class. If he believes that the systems of power serve him and promote justice rather than work for his capitalist masters, he will not attempt to dismantle them. The worker must then not only overcome his oppressor, he must first transcend his own ideological beliefs and ignorance before he can even begin to extricate himself. </p>
<p>In many ways, us workers are our own worst enemy. We lose our humanity, become alienated from our highest self, our families, our communities, our coworkers, and the Earth Mother. As participants in and recipients of unfettered capitalism, we have become the unwitting tools of universal oppression and militarism we claim to disdain. Our demise stems from the misinterpretation of reality and our shifting location within a volatile matrix of phantasmagoric holograms, none of which are real. </p>
<p>We believe what we hear and do what we are told rather than think critically about anything. Questioning authority makes us uncomfortable, and there are always consequences to challenging the dominant paradigm. We have an abiding psychological need to believe that everything we think we know about our country and the world is as advertised because the alternative terrifies us. We thus surrender our conscience and our life to become a tool of the unscrupulous sociopaths in power.</p>
<p>The American worker must comprehend that his assigned role within the capitalist system is not to be a thoughtful or conscious human being, but rather an efficient economic serf, a dehumanized automaton concealed within in a human husk. Painful as this reality is, it does not behoove us to believe or act otherwise. The worker’s plight is like being a solider in the war-torn Middle East: take orders and do what you are told. Check your conscience and your humanity at the door. We all know where that leads. </p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, perhaps we may finally begin the vital work of our individual and collective emancipation. Our subordinate role in this unequal economic, social, and political arrangement must be challenged and subverted. No one is born a slave. The only power anyone has over us is that which we allow them to have. </p>

<p>The arrogance of Barack Obama’s administration in railroading the original passage of <a href="http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/llj/LLJ-Archives/Vol-105/no-2/2013-7.pdf">Obamacare</a> through the House of Representatives circumventing regular order is only superseded by the incessant &#8220;Big Lie&#8221; campaign pushed by Ezekiel Emanuel, the doctor of chutzpah. <a href="http://freepatriot.org/2013/11/14/megyn-kelly-yells-at-ezekiel-emanuel-for-lying/">Megyn Kelly Yells at Ezekiel Emanuel for Lying</a>, is just one pathetic example of the Emanuel family habitual distortion of language to extort the last drop of blood from the suffering public. A previously unpublished essay, Rahm Emanuel &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/030910.html">The Son of the Devil&#8217;s Spawn</a>&#8220;, details the tactics used by the hit squad team of the Obama outfit.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://batr.org/view/081212.html">Chicago Gangster &#8211; Obama the Tyrant</a> handwriting is all over the Affordable Care Act. Such overbearing egotism, explained by lack of character and morality, is apparent. &#8220;His mobster origins are on display with every unconstitutional action he takes. He is turning the land of the free into the territory of the damned. With all the ranting and phony rage against the rich, he continues to take his marching orders from the Wall Street crime syndicate commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Obamacare theater of the absurd is unraveling and would be a comedy romp if it were not hurting so many in need medical patients. <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/366828/who-says-obama-hasnt-united-country-john-fund">Who Says Obama Hasn’t United the Country?</a>, so says the respected journalist John Fund. The American public overwhelmingly is rejecting the disaster, known as the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yesterday the Obama administration suddenly moved to allow hundreds of thousands of people who’ve lost their insurance due to Obamacare to sign up for bare-bone &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; plans. It’s at least the 14th unilateral change to Obamacare that’s been made without consulting Congress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It shows that the Obamacare insurance products aren’t selling so, at the last minute, the administration is holding a fire sale on a failed launch,&#8221; says Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, a health-care advocacy group. &#8220;Just think how you must feel if you were one of the people who spent the last two months fighting their way through <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">HealthCare.gov</a> to buy a policy that will be thousands of dollars more expensive than this catastrophic insurance!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Government marketing under central planning is salivating treats for the lawyers. Just wonder how long it will be for the trickle down litigation parade to start when all those cancelled policies end up in unpaid medical bills.</p>
<p>When Peter Hart, states the progressive watchdog group position in <a href="http://fair.org/">FAIR</a>, that <a href="http://www.fair.org/blog/2013/12/02/obamacare-as-a-big-government-failure/">Obamacare as a &#8216;Big Government&#8217; Failure</a>, you know that the love affair is over for the easy sell job.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The implication in all of these discussions is that the Affordable Care Act represents some kind of &#8220;activist government&#8221; intervention to disrupt the normally smooth workings of the private sector.</p>
<p>But that is neither the intent nor the effect of the law. The main purpose of Obamacare is the preservation of the private insurance system; the website functionality that has generated so many headlines is largely due to the fact that a decentralized, means-tested system has to be grafted onto a complex, profit-seeking insurance industry. If the White House was rolling out an actual &#8220;big government&#8221; healthcare policy options–a public option, or a single-payer system–and there was anything like the current mess, then perhaps this conversation would make some sense.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Examine the discernment disconnect in this assessment. While, the generous donations from favored insurance companies bought access and even promises of reimbursement for short-term cash flow expenses from potential losses, the basic business model of Obamacare is not sustainable.</p>
<p>The actual intention of the dictatorial practices of the technocratic bureaucracy administration is to cause a massive failure of private insurance and create the political conditions for a government rescue of a very different medical system.</p>
<p>Joe Otto of the Conservative Daily writes in <a href="http://smna.shufflingmadness.com/track?t=v&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbXNpZD0xJmF1aWQ9MTE3MjE1NSZtaWQ9MTgzMTQmbXNnaWQ9MTY3MDAmZGlkPTM0MDEmZWRpZD0zNDAxJnNuPTE2Nzc5OTAxJmVpZD1iYXRyc2FydHJlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSZlZWlkPWJhdHJzYXJ0cmVAZ21haWwuY29tJnVpZD1iYXRyc2FydHJlQGdtYWlsLmNvbSZy">Obamacare Will Tax You Even AFTER You Die!</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Deep within the thousands of pages of law and regulations for the Affordable Care Act is a hidden provision that allows the government to take control of YOUR estate after you pass away in order to pay for any medical bills that the government covered while you were alive.</p>
<p>For those of us receiving private insurance, God help us if the Democrats are able to eventually achieve their goal of a single-payer healthcare system. If the Government is able to claim they paid for ANY of your healthcare, they’ll come for their payment when you are gone and can’t fight them. However for the millions of people being duped today into signing up for Medicare and Medicaid, this gives the government free reign to raid the estates of poor and middle class Americans after they die.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you read that? The intention is to discontinue Medicare promises and place everyone under an Obamacare umbrella that will tap your funds for reimbursement back to the government. If this were not the biggest bait and switch scheme ever, what would you call it?</p>
<p>Would Congress reverse this odious and draconian provision, or will the legislature simply continue to look the other way and let Obama or succeeding potentates impose de facto penalties?</p>
<p>Would Congress reverse this odious and draconian provision, or will the legislature simply continue to look the other way and let Obama or succeeding potentates impose de facto penalties?</p>
<p>Even the Daily Kos cannot avoid the implications in <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/17/1248425/-Medicaid-Estate-Recovery-ACA-Unintended-Consequences">Medicaid Estate Recovery + ACA: Unintended Consequences?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Affordable Care Act of 2010. Estate recovery will be forced on millions of people who might have otherwise gone without insurance. Why? Because the plan is that millions more Americans have health insurance. That would be accomplished by expanding Medicaid and implementing premium assistance (subsidies). When a person is found to be eligible for Medicaid, they will be automatically enrolled into their state&#8217;s Medicaid program. Those forced into Medicaid will, due to the federal law, also be forced into estate recovery. Their estates will be partly or fully taken over by the federal or state government when they die.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As the public absorbs the hits to their own personal circumstances, the backlash against government medicine will grow louder. However, in the article <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/103013.html">Insurance Companies Profit from Obamacare</a>, describes that the old model for medical payment coverage help caused runaway costs. &#8220;Now put this argument into a proper perspective. WHY should insurance companies profit at all, and WHY is it necessary for private companies to issue insurance for medical coverage to begin with?&#8221;</p>
<p>The medicine lobby was AWOL when the mandates were established. Doctors are bleeding themselves, because they adopted a method of payment for their services that bypassed the free market of patient to the doctor relationship.</p>
<p>Insurance does not have to be a service for profit. Administrative expenses and actuarial factors could be the pass through costs that determine rates. Under the current protected system, the Obamacare formula guarantees the mega insurance titans returns, while assuring that the quality of medical treatment declines or becomes not existent.</p>
<p>Why would any practicing physician want to continue to operate under this preordained system? Indentured servants to government rationed therapy that ultimately leads to death panels is not exactly the best recovery for socialized illness.</p>
<p>The prudent response for general practitioners and specialists is to lobby for their rights to practice outside the Insurance/Medicare/ Medicaid matrix. Cash on the barrelhead needs to be the new prescription.</p>
<p>For those hard-pressed medical policy owners, the future ceiling on premiums, deductibles and other out of pocket co-pay costs should be a wakeup call that motivates alternatives. The unmistakable choice is to cancel any medical insurance and start a personal medical self-financed saving plan.</p>
<p>Add up the costs, stashing away money will accomplish three tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>It will force corporate insurance to go in panic mode</li>
<li>It will doom any government mandate for compulsory coverage</li>
<li>It will place the responsibility for your heath care where it belongs, in your own hands.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The mutual objective that everyone should seek is to improve the quality of medical treatment at a fair value price.</p>
<p>An imperiousness government that looks to confiscate your estate proves, for the last time, that the master plans for social medicine, like Medicare and Medicaid, were never viable in the beginning.</p>
<p>That “Great Society”, starting with LBJ to the deceitful promises of a community organizer thug named Barack Obama, produced the biggest failed government in history. The “ROT” and stench that smells up the public arena is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Obamacare has manifested the depths and extent that this administration prevaricates. Finally, the public is starting to understand that their future is more in jeopardy than their immediate health.</p>
<p>The blackmail of Chief Justice Robert, who flipped the <a href="http://www.westernjournalism.com/was-chief-justice-john-roberts-blackmailed/">Supreme Court decision</a> that called Obamacare a tax, was just the opening shot to obliterate the rule of law. Domineering intimidation by the merchants of death is not unusual, when snake oil is dispensed as a medication. The remedy for a healthy country is to cut out the tumor.</p>
<p>Ridding the political process, from the corrupt culture of dominating communalism, starts with independent thought and action. There is no miracle cure for national recovery. Nevertheless, the uproar over the Obamacare disaster provides an opportunity to <a href="http://batr.org/view/091613.html">implode</a> the regime.</p>
<p>Refuse the mandates and cancel medical coverage. In the end, health care decisions are as personal as it gets.</p>

<p>Most of us know that the environment has a tremendous effect on our physical and mental well-being but did you know that our thoughts directly affect the way we physically feel? Remember always that we live and exist as part of a vast, elaborate, and intricate matrix of consciousness where everything affects everything else. There are numerous causes to any one effect. Reality is far more complex than we sometimes realize. It’s far easier on our brains to overly simplify Reality’s operating system yet by doing so we can end up blocking out an understanding of how we are living a shadow of the amazing life we could be experiencing. Let’s take a look at a program in the operating system of Reality that affects us on a daily basis in very intimate ways: <em>our thoughts affecting our well-being.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Anger Makes You Physically Sick</strong></h3>
<p>According to a 2006 Harvard study, 10 million adult men in the United States are so angry that they’re sick. In fact, their disease has a name: <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mental_Health_Letter/2011/April/treating-intermittent-explosive-disorder">intermittent explosive disorder</a>, or IED. It’s been something recognized since 1980 but has existed for millenia before humans discovered the facts of the matter. Besides a person filled with <a href="http://shift.is/understanding-anger">anger</a> and rage being an immediate threat to any property or people that may happen to be within swinging distance, there is some serious damage that is happening internally as well. People who experience frequent outbursts of anger have been found to be more likely to die of heart disease or stroke.</p>
<p>In fact, more than 30,000 heart attacks each year are triggered by momentary anger, according to a 2004 Harvard study. “People who have a lot of anger invest a lot of energy in trying to control it, and that kind of friction is likely to increase the probability of a heart attack,” says Charles Spielberger, Ph.D., a University of South Florida psychologist who developed the most widely used test to measure anger. “The more intense the anger, the more likely the heart attack.” Other studies have shown that angry men are three times more likely to develop premature cardiovascular disease, six times more likely to have an early heart attack, and three times more likely to have a stroke.</p>
<h3><strong>Your Attitude Affects How Long You Live</strong></h3>
<p>Research into the body-mind connection has discovered that if you expect illness you increase the odds of getting an illness and if you expect good health your chances of enjoying good health are increased. The <a href="http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3642356.stm">University of Texas found</a> people with an upbeat view of life were less likely than pessimists to show signs of frailty and disease. Another study that was published in the same journal suggests that physical performance can be influenced by mental attitude, indicating the intimate interplay between physical and mental systems.</p>
<p>Researchers from North Carolina State University did a study with results that showed that memory performance in older adults was lower when they were primed with negative stereotypes. In contrast, there was much less difference in performance between young and older adults primed with positive stereotypes. The researchers say their findings suggest that if older people are treated like they are competent, productive members of society, then they perform that way too. This shows that the thoughts of others about us affect the thoughts we have about ourselves if we are aware of what those thoughts are. Once again the intricate network of inter-connectivity shows itself to be very, very real.</p>
<h3><strong>Negative Emotions Affect Our Life Force on Subtle Levels<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>In the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0877287139/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0877287139&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=shift08-20">Pranic Healing</a> there is a more subtle look into how our thoughts and emotions affect our well-being. The following is a quote from the book on this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Energetically speaking, anger and frustration result in pranic (<a title="A Healer’s Perspective on Psychedelics and the Body to Mind Connection" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/11/22/healers-perspective-psychedelics-body-mind-connection/">chi</a>/qi/energy) depletion around the solar plexus and abdominal areas or may manifest as pranic congestion around the solar plexus and heart area. In the first case, it manifests itself as indigestion or loose bowel movements. In the long run, it may manifest itself as ulcers or as a gall bladder problem. In the second case, it may manifest itself as a heart enlargement or other heart related problems. It seems that a certain type of negative emotion may manifest as a certain type of disease in one patient but may manifest as another type of disease in another.</p>
<p>Anger and intense worry devitalize the whole bioplasmic body so that the body becomes susceptible to all kinds of diseases. Negative emotions cause disturbances in the bioplasmic body so that the whole physical body becomes sick. You may have experienced that after an intense anger or an intense altercation, you felt physically exhausted or became sick. This is because both the bioplasmic and visible physical bodies are drained of prana and became susceptible to infection.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Too Much Relationship Commitment May Increase Anxiety, Depression &amp; Hostility</strong></h3>
<p>This one is definitely worth elaborating on. As in <a href="http://shift.is/2013/05/freeing-ourselves-from-emotional-manipulation/">my article</a> on what happens in a relationship when passion overrides love, we can find yet again what happens when we allow our egos invest an unbalanced amount of energy and focus towards one person. Because of the dynamics of human interaction and relationships when there is a state of disequilibrium the relationships can fail and when they do the emotional pain is magnified several times over.</p>
<p><a href="http://phys.org/news147463620.html">A study</a> by the University of Houston has found that there is too much emotional weight placed on a relationship one or both people involved will evaluate their self-worth by the out comes of their romantic interactions. This happens so commonly psychologists even gave it a name (relationship-contingent self-esteem).</p>
<p>People with high levels of RCSE are very committed in their relationships but can experience manic, needy, and obsessive behaviors with regards to love. Researcher Chip Knee said that <em>“when something happens in a relationship, these individuals don’t separate themselves from it. They immediately feel personally connected to any negative circumstance in a relationship and become anxious, more depressed and hostile.”</em>  What goes wrong doesn’t even have to be a big event. It can be as simple as the other person not returning their texts, calls, snapchats, etc. The study doesn’t suggest that commitment is bad in itself but rather the wrong kind of commitment like the kind that arises from an egoistic desire to fill a void in a person’s life with another person that becomes a desolate wasteland when that person isn’t there in some capacity.</p>
<h3><strong>Being Happier Leads to Better Health</strong></h3>
<p>Monty Python famously sang <em>“Always look on the bright side of life.”</em> Yes there is death and destruction mercilessly given out but there is also compassion and creation introduced into our world. Just like the ancient adage says that the <a href="http://shift.is/2013/04/the-world-is-your-mirror/">world is our mirror</a>, so too does this apply to health through happiness.</p>
<p>Several studies have found that optimism does indeed lead to greater happiness and longevity. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine did <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19667234">a study</a> on post-menopausal women and found that they were healthier and lived longer than their counterparts that chose to dwell in pessimism. With 100,000 women being a part of this study who were tracked for 8 years, the results are quite firm. Women in the “cynically hostile” group suffered poorer health, had a 16% higher risk of dying from any cause, and a 23% higher risk of dying from cancer.</p>
<p>If you have an optimistic state of mind you have a better ability to become accomplished in life, are better able to cope with stress, and can take on life challenges more resiliently…all of these have been confirmed by modern scientific studies but have been talked about by the wise ancients for millenia. In the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0843128682/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0843128682&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=shift08-20">Being Happy!</a> author Andrew Matthews looks to the scientific research that have been done that showing just how damaging a negative state of mind really is and the results are shocking. For instance, when blood samples taken from people who were feeling anger and fear were injected into guinea pigs <em>they literally dropped dead</em> in less then two minutes. Negative emotions are self-destructive and if there was ever a reason to consciously stop fear and anger in their tracks, that’s a big one for sure.</p>
<h3><strong>Happy a Positive Attitude Reduces Pain and Fatigue</strong></h3>
<p>Even when we are on death’s doorstep, happy a positive attitude about it will reduce the pain and suffering we feel. <a href="http://www.cancer-therapy.org/CT/v6/A/40._Kurtz_et_al,_367-376%201.pdf">A study</a> done by Dr Margot E Kurtz and her team from the Michigan State University with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy found that cancer patients with more optimistic outlooks were able to feel less pain associated with the cancers. Patients who had a strong sense of control over their environment experienced less severe fatigue.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to stay positive when you’re face with your own mortality in such a life-changing way but if you understand that there is a degree of pain and suffering that doesn’t have to exist on top of that which you can’t control, it all becomes much easier to cope with. At the very least, we can reduce the pain and fatigue we have in these kinds of life circumstances if we find ways to elevate our spirits out of the dark depths of confronting death.</p>
<h3><strong>Stress Can Literally Cause Cancer</strong></h3>
<p>Stress is called the mother of all dis-ease and with evidence of cancer being sprung into existence with the help of stress we can truly say stress is a menace to society. Prof Xu and a team of researchers at Yale University did <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2010/01/13/stress-triggers-tumor-formation-yale-researchers-find">a study</a> on fruit flies and found that everyday emotional stress triggers the growth of cancerous tumors. What happens is that stress opens up pathways between cells that allow mutations to spread, leading to cancer taking over.  Stress, be it physical or emotional, is never good. This seems like a given yet how often do we find ourselves unnecessarily stressing over things we either can’t control or that we blow out of proportion? Stress is something that can be controlled with things such as deep breathing, being tuned into the present moment, and of course having a regular meditation practice.</p>
<h3><strong>…and Bias Towards Negativity Causes Stress</strong></h3>
<p>Riding on the “stress causes cancer” train, <a href="http://phys.org/news184348666.html">researchers have found</a> that people who notice negative information over positive information are more stressed out. This is especially true for ‘news junkies’ and ties into <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli">research that found</a> reading the news can make you want to grab a bottle of antidepressants and swallow all the pills. Researchers from the University of Essex found that they could predict the body’s reaction to stress up to eight months after they measured a person’s bias towards positive or negative images. The results indicate that people who are biased towards negativity have a much greater risk of having an anxiety disorder as a result.</p>
<h3><strong>Optimists Are Less Likely To Get Heart Disease</strong></h3>
<p>Just by living in a positive state of mind greatly reduces your risk of heart disease according to <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/179505.php">new research</a>. This was the first study, in fact, that made a direct connection between positive emotions and lower risk of heart disease. The study which went on for 10 years found that people that don’t dwell in positivity had a 22% greater risk of developing heart disease. That’s too large of a risk to not take to heart. Since happier people tend to sleep better and not have such erratic sleeping patterns, their bodies are less stressed and strained. Happier people are also better able to move on after something unfortunate happens to them than unhappy people who tend to dwell longer on negative experiences.</p>
<h3><strong>…and Fight Off Illnesses More Easily</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>It turns out that when we are pessimistic we actually have a weaker immune system response to illnesses such as viral infections. This can result in a prolonged cold or flu that we definitely would not enjoy. In <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7532964/Staying-optimistic-keeps-you-healthy.html">a study</a> where scientists tracked the well-being of students for a year and tested their immune systems, they found very strong responses to challenges to their immune systems if those students were generally optimistic. There was a clear demonstration that when they were optimistic their immune systems got stronger and when they were pessimistic their immune systems got weaker.</p>
<h3><strong>You Really *Are* As Old As You Feel</strong></h3>
<p>Obviously we won’t stay 21 forever but if we shift our perception of reality in such a way that we don’t fall into negative thinking about how we’re getting older and therefore we’re going to ache more, sleep less, weigh more, and so on, we’ll have more vitality. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100302123144.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">A study</a> led by Markus Schafer found that if we mentally keep on imprinting our minds with the idea that we’re old (or rather, that we’re going to experience the negative effects of aging before we actually get old) it will have a direct negative effect on our physical bodies. “We found that these people who felt young for their age were more likely to have greater confidence about their cognitive abilities a decade later,” Schafer said. “Yes, chronological age was important, but the subjective age had a stronger effect.</p>
<h3><strong>Your Vision Can Improve If You Think It’s Improved</strong></h3>
<p>In a remarkable case of our thoughts shaping our reality, our eyesight can improve if we believe that we can see especially well. <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/21/5/661">This finding</a>, by psychologist Ellen Langer from Harvard University shows that perception can truly become reality, or at the very least help usher that reality into existence. Out of all the findings Langer had in her research, the most incredible one was when 20 men and women (all with normal eyesight) were shown a reverse eye chart that was arranged so the letters became larger the further down they went, not smaller. Surprisingly, they accurately reported more letters from the smallest two lines than they did when shown a traditional eye chart with the largest letters at the top. The conclusion from all of the findings was that while vision may not improve itself, out mind-set is more accurately perceiving what it is seeing.</p>
<h3><strong>Insecurity in Relationships Leads to Greater Risk of Heart Problems</strong></h3>
<p>People who feel insecure in their relationships have been found to have increased heart problems later on in life. In <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100720123641.htm">a study </a>published by the American Psychological Association which examined data on 5,645 adults found that people who felt insecure in relationships or avoided getting close to others are at a higher risk of developing several chronic diseases. The cardiovascular system seems to be especially hard hit from relationship insecurity and this makes sense since a relationship is heart-based in nature.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Physical Effects of Negative Emotions</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7671353">A Harvard Medical School Study</a> of 1,623 heart attack survivors found that when subjects became angry during emotional conflicts, their risk of subsequent heart attacks was more than double that of those that remained calm.</li>
<li>Men who complain of high anxiety are up to <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/90/5/2225.full.pdf">six times</a> more likely than calmer men to suffer sudden cardiac death.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9054737">A 20-year study</a> of over 1,700 older men conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that worry about social conditions, health and personal finances all significantly increased the risk of coronary heart disease.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9290512">An international study</a> of 2,829 people between the ages of 55 and 85 found that individuals who reported the highest levels of personal “mastery”— feelings of control over life events—had a nearly 60% lower risk of death compared with those who felt relatively helpless in the face of life’s challenges.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3282538">Three 10-year studies</a> concluded that emotional stress was more predictive of death from cancer and cardiovascular disease than smoking; people who were unable to effectively manage their stress had a 40% higher death rate than non-stressed individuals.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9172848">A study</a> of heart attack survivors showed that patients’ emotional state and relationships in the period after myocardial infarction are as important as the disease severity in determining their prognosis.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/223110204_Self-regulation_and_mortality_from_cancer_coronary_heart_disease_and_other_causes_A_prospective_study">In a study</a> of 5,716 middle-aged people, those with the highest self-regulation abilities were over 50 times more likely to be alive and without chronic disease 15 years later than those with the lowest self-regulation scores.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20411235">new study</a> has found that our state of mind can either speed up or slow down how fast we heal from an illness. The study looked at diabetes patients and found that those with the worst depression were the least likely to heal quickly from foot ulcers.</li>

<p>Art is dangerous. It makes people move out of standard-response channels.</p>
<p>They don’t see what they’re supposed to see anymore. They see what they’re not supposed to see.</p>
<p>That’s why colleges teach brain-deadening courses in art history. Every attempt is made to codify the students’ reactions.</p>
<p>I’m not just talking about political art. I mean anything that truly comes out of reliance on imagination.</p>
<p>Those who run things—and their willing dupes—want reality to look a certain way and be experienced and felt in certain ways. These limited spectra form a shared lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Even so-called spiritual experience is codified. It’s called organized religion. I call it “give money to the ceiling.” You give your money and they tell you high how the ceiling of your experience is and what you’ll find when you get there.</p>
<p>Art has none of these limitations. It’s created by people who’ve gone beyond the shrunken catalog of emotions, thoughts, and perceptions listed by authorities.</p>
<p>Art, by which I mean imagination, throws caution to the winds. It invents realities that engender new reactions, never before experienced. It blows apart old rigid perception.</p>
<p>The hammer blows and the soft propaganda of the common culture install layers of mind control: “See things, experience things in these prescribed ways.”</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve encouraged a number of people to become artists. Aside from the work they then invented, I noticed their whole approach to, and perception of, life altered radically.</p>
<p>Their sense of vitality, their courage, their adventurous spirit came to the foreground.</p>
<p>Mind control, externally applied and self-induced, is all about putting a lid on creative power. That is its real target.</p>
<p>The one trap an artist—which is to say anyone who lives through and by imagination—has to avoid is thinking of himself as a victim because he is “an outsider.”</p>
<p>Outside is good. Outside has great strength.</p>
<p>When an artist invents himself as a victim, he then goes on to lash out at people who have nothing to do with the fate to which he’s consigned himself.</p>
<p>Authorities in any society, no matter what they call themselves, are invested in systems that will maintain a status quo of perception. They are constantly producing new systems for that purpose.</p>
<p>Technocrats would like you to believe that hooking your brain up to some super-brain computer will fulfill your needs and desires. They seek to prove that all invention, all creation, all art, all imagination is merely a set of calculations within a closed system.</p>
<p>This effort betrays their own despair. They see no way they can truly create.</p>
<p>It is the vacuum in which all elites live. They build up a frozen dead consciousness of models and algorithms and “solutions,” and they seek to impose it, as reality, on the minds of populations.</p>
<p>Essentially, they’re saying, <em>“If we have a soul-sickness, you have to have it, too.”</em></p>
<p>It’s called hatred of life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, individual creative power launches from a platform of freedom and rises through layer after layer of greater freedom.</p>
<p>From that perspective, authoritarian power looks like a sick-unto-dying charade.</p>

<p>In the 1999 sci-fi film classic <em>The Matrix</em>, the protagonist, Neo, is stunned to see people defying the laws of physics, running up walls and vanishing suddenly. These superhuman violations of the rules of the universe are possible because, unbeknownst to him, Neo’s consciousness is embedded in the Matrix, a virtual-reality simulation created by sentient machines.</p>
<p>The action really begins when Neo is given a fateful choice: Take the blue pill and return to his oblivious, virtual existence, or take the red pill to learn the truth about the Matrix and find out “how deep the rabbit hole goes.”</p>
<p>Physicists can now offer us the same choice, the ability to test whether we live in our own virtual Matrix, by studying radiation from space. As fanciful as it sounds, some philosophers have long argued that we’re actually more likely to be artificial intelligences trapped in a fake universe than we are organic minds in the “real” one.</p>
<p>But if that were true, the very laws of physics that allow us to devise such reality-checking technology may have little to do with the fundamental rules that govern the meta-universe inhabited by our simulators. To us, these programmers would be gods, able to twist reality on a whim.</p>
<p>So should we say yes to the offer to take the red pill and learn the truth — or are the implications too disturbing?</p>
<h4>Worlds in Our Grasp</h4>
<p>The first serious attempt to find the truth about our universe came in 2001, when an effort to calculate the resources needed for a universe-size simulation made the prospect seem impossible.</p>
<p>Seth Lloyd, a quantum-mechanical engineer at MIT, estimated the number of “computer operations” our universe has performed since the Big Bang — basically, every event that has ever happened. To repeat them, and generate a perfect facsimile of reality down to the last atom, would take more energy than the universe has.</p>
<p>“The computer would have to be bigger than the universe, and time would tick more slowly in the program than in reality,” says Lloyd. “So why even bother building it?”</p>
<p>But others soon realized that making an imperfect copy of the universe that’s just good enough to fool its inhabitants would take far less computational power. In such a makeshift cosmos, the fine details of the microscopic world and the farthest stars might only be filled in by the programmers on the rare occasions that people study them with scientific equipment. As soon as no one was looking, they’d simply vanish.</p>
<p>In theory, we’d never detect these disappearing features, however, because each time the simulators noticed we were observing them again, they’d sketch them back in.</p>
<p>That realization makes creating virtual universes eerily possible, even for us. Today’s supercomputers already crudely model the early universe, simulating how infant galaxies grew and changed. Given the rapid technological advances we’ve witnessed over past decades — your cell phone has more processing power than NASA’s computers had during the moon landings — it’s not a huge leap to imagine that such simulations will eventually encompass intelligent life.</p>
<p>“We may be able to fit humans into our simulation boxes within a century,” says Silas Beane, a nuclear physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Beane develops simulations that re-create how elementary protons and neutrons joined together to form ever larger atoms in our young universe.</p>
<p>Legislation and social mores could soon be all that keeps us from creating a universe of artificial, but still feeling, humans — but our tech-savvy descendants may find the power to play God too tempting to resist.</p>
<div><img alt="cosmic-rays" src="http://discovermagazine.com/~/media/Images/Issues/2013/December/cosmic-rays.jpg?mw=300" /><br />
<em>If cosmic rays don&#8217;t have random origins, it could be a sign that the universe is a simulation. National Science Foundation/J. Yang</em></p>
</div>
<p>They could create a plethora of pet universes, vastly outnumbering the real cosmos. This thought led philosopher Nick Bostrom at the University of Oxford to conclude in 2003 that it makes more sense to bet that we’re delusional silicon-based artificial intelligences in one of these many forgeries, rather than carbon-based organisms in the genuine universe. Since there seemed no way to tell the difference between the two possibilities, however, bookmakers did not have to lose sleep working out the precise odds.</p>
<h4>Learning the Truth</h4>
<p>That changed in 2007 when John D. Barrow, professor of mathematical sciences at Cambridge University, suggested that an imperfect simulation of reality would contain detectable glitches. Just like your computer, the universe’s operating system would need updates to keep working.</p>
<p>As the simulation degrades, Barrow suggested, we might see aspects of nature that are supposed to be static — such as the speed of light or the fine-structure constant that describes the strength of the electromagnetic force — inexplicably drift from their “constant” values.</p>
<p>Last year, Beane and colleagues suggested a more concrete test of the simulation hypothesis. Most physicists assume that space is smooth and extends out infinitely. But physicists modeling the early universe cannot easily re-create a perfectly smooth background to house their atoms, stars and galaxies. Instead, they build up their simulated space from a lattice, or grid, just as television images are made up from multiple pixels.</p>
<p>The team calculated that the motion of particles within their simulation, and thus their energy, is related to the distance between the points of the lattice: the smaller the grid size, the higher the energy particles can have. That means that if our universe is a simulation, we’ll observe a maximum energy amount for the fastest particles. And as it happens, astronomers have noticed that cosmic rays, high-speed particles that originate in far-flung galaxies, always arrive at Earth with a specific maximum energy of about 1020 electron volts.</p>
<p>The simulation’s lattice has another observable effect that astronomers could pick up. If space is continuous, then there is no underlying grid that guides the direction of cosmic rays — they should come in from every direction equally. If we live in a simulation based on a lattice, however, the team has calculated that we wouldn’t see this even distribution. If physicists do see an uneven distribution, it would be a tough result to explain if the cosmos were real.</p>
<p>Astronomers need much more cosmic ray data to answer this one way or another. For Beane, either outcome would be fine. “Learning we live in a simulation would make no more difference to my life than believing that the universe was seeded at the Big Bang,” he says. But that’s because Beane imagines the simulators as driven purely to understand the cosmos, with no desire to interfere with their simulations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our almighty simulators may instead have programmed us into a universe-size reality show — and are capable of manipulating the rules of the game, purely for their entertainment. In that case, maybe our best strategy is to lead lives that amuse our audience, in the hope that our simulator-gods will resurrect us in the afterlife of next-generation simulations.</p>
<p>The weird consequences would not end there. Our simulators may be simulations themselves — just one rabbit hole within a linked series, each with different fundamental physical laws. “If we’re indeed a simulation, then that would be a logical possibility, that what we’re measuring aren’t really the laws of nature, they’re some sort of attempt at some sort of artificial law that the simulators have come up with. That’s a depressing thought!” says Beane.</p>
<p>This cosmic ray test may help reveal whether we are just lines of code in an artificial Matrix, where the established rules of physics may be bent, or even broken. But if learning that truth means accepting that you may never know for sure what’s real — including yourself — would you want to know?</p>
<p>There is no turning back, Neo: Do you take the blue pill, or the red pill?</p>
<h4>The Matrix Revealed</h4>
<p>Tantalizingly, just weeks before <em>The Matrix </em>came out in 1999, astronomers analyzing the light from distant galaxies published hints that the universe’s “constants” might not be so constant. Specifically, they found that the value of the fine-structure constant — which determines how the galaxies’ light should appear — is one thousandth of a percent bigger today than it was 10 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Glitches caused by our simulation being patched up could also be at the root of truly bizarre results that defy the normal rules of physics. One such possible effect appeared in 2011, when physicists working on the OPERA experiment in Europe made headlines as they claimed to have measured subatomic particles called neutrinos traveling faster than the speed of light, considered the universal speed limit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither case proved a slam-dunk for a virtual universe. Independent tests could not back up the fine-structure constant data, and the speedy neutrinos turned out to be due to a faulty experimental setup. But there is a more fantastical explanation: These inconstant-constants may have instead been simulation glitches, glimpsed just before our programmers fixed them.</p>

<p>Obama has no one to blame but himself:</p>
<p>He was the one who campaigned, in 2008, on Hope and Change. He was the one who deployed high-flying rhetoric to promise a new day in Washington politics.</p>
<p>He was the one who said he was going elevate the level of discourse and make government transparent. He positioned himself as a new kind of leader. He was the one who turned his candidacy into a religious experience.</p>
<p>He was the one who convinced voters he stood above the fray, as a man and as a symbol, and on that basis they boarded his train and rode it all the way.</p>
<p>He was the one who, inheriting a desperate economy, made his signature move upon gaining office:</p>
<p>Obamacare.</p>
<p>Not jobs. Not prosecutions of corporate and banking criminals.</p>
<p>He made devastating choices for all Americans.</p>
<p>He was and is the one who has presided over a sinking economic ship.</p>
<p>Given his proclivity for big and bigger government, he could have launched a serious public program, one which really put people back to work, repairing the infrastructure of the nation. But even this was beyond him.</p>
<p>And getting out of the way and letting Americans expand their small businesses, and supporting them with the same intensity of rhetoric he used to win his election? Out of the question. Not in the playbook. Not for a second.</p>
<p>His big play out of the gate, Obamacare, shocked his closest advisers. They assumed jobs would be his number-one priority. They were dead wrong.</p>
<p>And what about “post-racial” America? That was not only a dud, it was a disaster. Division and polarization are the order of the day.</p>
<p>How about dependence, and government as the solver of all problems, as the beneficent giver? How has that worked out? How can it possibly work out? America is going to become one big Sweden? Really?</p>
<p>It’s one thing for a Clinton or a Bush to lie and skate and divert and play the usual horrific games. But Obama set himself up as a man who was fundamentally different. That was his ace. That was how he won the Presidency. That was what people bought into.</p>
<p>So he falls further, even as his media supporters keep launching blizzards of lies to prop him up.</p>
<p>Many of his loyal followers believe “powerful forces” have fenced Obama in and sabotaged his efforts to work positive transformations. If so, then as a transcendent figure, he should step forward and use his oratorical powers to expose the criminal enterprise that surrounds the Presidency. He should speak directly to the American people and lay it on the line.</p>
<p>Or else he confesses that he is, in fact, another Clinton, another Bush.</p>
<p>The public loves fairy tales and myths, but considering the shape this country is in, that fascination is wearing very thin. It isn’t going to sustain the next three years of Obama in the White House.</p>
<p>The Matrix Revealed</p>
<p>90 million people are out of the work force. 50 million are on food stamps. Recovery? Is the President really going to keep pushing that narrative?</p>
<p>Admitting the truth might, as a long shot, create a platform from which Obama could launch a real campaign to restore jobs…but faking the unemployment crisis has been his chosen path.</p>
<p>The government Obamacare website is a shambles. It doesn’t appear that a simple fix is possible, which means chaos will continue for many months, perhaps longer. Private insurance companies are canceling hundreds of thousands of policies.</p>
<p>The last seven years of American political life have added up to a disaster. Blaming it all on Congressional gridlock, on delaying the ability of the White House to invent trillions more in debt at the drop of a hat, isn’t working.</p>
<p>So many actions and omissions of madness…it leaves us with the reasonable conclusion that Obama’s Presidency was designed from the outset to flame out and fail.</p>
<p>And the principal target was the economy.</p>
<p>The President, fresh off an election victory in 2008, and in that glow, could have used his monumental leverage to put people back to work. He could have hammered on it day and night. He could have rallied support and energized the country.</p>
<p>But now…what do we have? Welfare America to the nth degree. Beyond what anyone thought was possible. And media traitors are backing it.</p>
<p>For decades, for more than a hundred years, power has been in the wrong place.</p>
<p>It belongs with you and with me.</p>

<p><i>First and foremost we should be governed by common sense. </i><i>~ </i>Vladimir Putin (<a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1690757_1695787-3,00.html" target="_blank">Time Magazine</a>, 2007)</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin is audaciously attempting to remove the brush covering from atop the common sense rabbit hole, which is not only a truly rare and subversive act in the eyes of the Con, but a potentially great gift to humanity – if only humanity had the sensitivity to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this will no doubt prove to be a thrilling ride for those willing to take up the challenge. Russians are fortunate to have such a sane leader, and the West would be wise to follow his lead, but what exactly does Mr. Putin mean by Common Sense?</p>
<p>Here’s a quick peek at a couple of dictionary definitions:</p>
<p><i>1)     </i><i>Sound judgment not based on specialized knowledge; native good judgment.</i></p>
<p><i>2)     </i><i>The basic ability to </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception" target="_blank"><i>perceive</i><i>,</i></a><i> </i><a title="Nous" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous" target="_blank"><i>understand</i></a><i>, and</i><i> </i><a title="Phronesis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phronesis" target="_blank"><i>judge</i></a><i> things.</i></p>
<p>The ability to soundly judge is important to understanding what common sense is all about, as is the fact that judgment is not an isolated act made according to individuated, specialized knowledge, but of something that is of a more general nature that is shared, common or native to the species as a whole.</p>
<p>To better understand how common sense operates as a cognitive process, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Aristotle&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Aristotle</a> provides a clear and useful description:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense#cite_note-11" target="_blank"><sup>]</sup></a> Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have “some one thing” which can distinguish black from sweet.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense#cite_note-12" target="_blank"><sup>]</sup></a> </em></p>
<p>see section on “Aristotelian Common Sense” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This shared or <i>common</i> sense, as opposed to a two-step Stimulus-Response model, appears to operate, according to Aristotle’s description, as a three-step process:</p>
<p>A) Perception</p>
<p>B) Understanding (through comparative analysis)</p>
<p>C) Judgment</p>
<p>Why is something as fundamental and basic to humanity’s existence operating according to a three-step rather than two-step process?</p>
<p>If you look around the world today, everything is presented in opposing, pairs: A-B. Not A-B-C.</p>
<p>As such, critical A-B-C thinking, <i>aka</i> Common Sense is fundamental to <a title="Humanity is Waking Up to the Intelligence of Nature" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/10/02/humanity-waking-intelligence-nature/">the evolution of awareness</a>, consciousness, cooperation and love which seems to occur with great frequency in nature, but not nearly as much in most human societies.</p>
<p>The Con understands this reality quite well, and they exploit it to their benefit. The Con does everything it can to lock humanity into a system characterized by dualism, stimulus-response programming, isolation, separation, competition, narcissism and egotism.</p>
<p>According to Aristotle’s logic, while each individual is inseparable from the whole, without common sense,<i>i.e.</i> a shared vision of the whole, perception of reality is too narrow, distorted and false.</p>
<p>Aristotle also said:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Common sense is where comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions or symbols or markers of what the specialist senses have perceived. This is therefore also where </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness" target="_blank"><i>consciousness</i></a><i> </i><i>originates, “for it makes us aware of having sensations at all”</i><i></i></p>
<p>see section on “Aristotelian Common Sense” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Aristotle emphasizes the act of comparison as critical to Understanding (Step B) the three-step A-B-C Common Sense-making process.</p>
<p>After perceiving an object, the perceiver compares and contrasts that object in relation to similar objects found within the perceiver’s experience. Finally, based on that understanding, the perceiver, in a creative act of synthesis, finds the true center or third way derived from the act of comparison and projects that decision out into the world.</p>
<p>In 2006, after carefully analyzing and deconstructing Vladimir Putin’s year 2000 Millennium Manifesto, author Gavin Slade from the Central European University in Budapest, an affiliate of The School of Russian and Asian Studies (SRAS), affirms the Russian leader’s propensity for utilizing in the political arena the type of Hegelian common sense widely discussed in this article:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>In the 1990s Russia’s political discourse was framed in terms of good and evil. There was little compromise or synthesis.</i></p>
<p><i>The rejection of revolution and change shows that Putin is effectively trying to establish a discourse focused on unity and stability knowing that the binary oppositions of politics during the Yeltsin era had created a situation where the state was unable “to muster a critical mass of leaders who articulate[d] one or another political discourse that resonate[d] in political society.</i><i></i></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sras.org/deconstructing_the_millennium_manifesto" target="_blank">http://www.sras.org/deconstructing_the_millennium_manifesto</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Rare among today’s world leaders, Vladimir Putin appears to well understand the evolutionary necessity of this <i>third way</i> approach to governance based on common sense-derived synthesis, and leverages that knowledge to promote unity, social cohesion and commonality of purpose on a national and international scale.</p>
<div><img src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/Putin-on-horse3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Aristotle even goes as far as to say that <a title="How Enlightenment is the Process of Creation in the Universe in Reverse" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/05/16/how-enlightenment-is-the-process-of-creation-in-the-universe-in-reverse/">common sense is where consciousness originates</a>. So if a society is lacking in common sense, and there’s little to no conscience, morality, empathy, consciousness, creativity, taste, discernment or love, how does one propose to govern such a population? This no doubt created a quandary for the rulers of large populations in the past, and clearly still presents governance challenges today.</p>
<p>The system’s time-honored, traditional answer to the problem of populations lacking in common sense was to oppress them into submission, with increased submission leading to an ever more constrictive cycle of dominance, oppression and abuse. It’s not outrageous to consider both parties to be at fault for this social dynamic that still exists and thrives today.</p>
<p>The cognitive process of common sense is part of humanity’s spiritual endowment and is similar to the Greek idea of knowledge or <i>nous</i>, which is the <i>divine spark or knowledge within</i> that is shared or common to all.</p>
<p>While <i>nous</i> may be common to all, it seems at present to be buried deep within the human psyche, and as such, unfortunately, is largely inactive.</p>
<p>Humanity’s drive to separate, exceptionalize and specialize (such groveling at the feet of society’s beloved specialists), is but a tiny sliver of the whole spoon-fed matrix. These absurd, <a title="Evolving Planetary Consciousness to Escape Self-Destruction" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/08/20/evolving-planetary-consciousness-to-escape-self-destruction/">self-destructive values</a> are automatically downloaded at face value and parroted aloud as that which <i>everybody knows</i>.</p>
<p>These automatic, pre-programmed responses demonstrate the process of individual and social decay which epitomizes dualistic A-B programming, and as such represents an evolutionary dead-end. And yet despite its flaws, this system, while abhorrent to many not only does have value in populations largely lacking in common sense, but also provides stark contrast to utopian social visions, as well as important motivation for those who wish to overcome its glaring inadequacies.</p>
<p>So cheer up, the news is not entirely bleak. To find oneself, one must first lose oneself, and so humanity has intentionally (if not consciously), led itself astray. The capacity for auto-correction is built into the natural system of the Earth and undoubtedly woven into the very fabric of cosmic existence itself. And yet in order to auto-correct, one must first dare to walk down dark paths leading to destinations unknown.</p>
<p>Compliance with Globalist diktat is ensured by the Con’s ability to provide endless streams of mindless distractions and short-term pleasures quick as you can afford them. And if you can’t afford them but still crave them, you get a gold star for being a motivated world citizen.</p>
<p>But try inducing people to step off that wheel, swallow the red pill and slide down the rabbit hole. Just see how that works out.</p>
<p>Of course this makes no sense. Why choose isolated, short-term pleasures over long-term ones? Freedom is sold cheap in exchange for a handful of trinkets and beads. But as the late great <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=George%20Carlin&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">George Carlin</a> once said: “nobody seems to notice; nobody seems to care.”</p>
<p>The average person, lacking common sense, is unable to step outside his bubble and recognize the divinely entangled oneness of reality.</p>
<p>How many times do you have to read in the alternative media about the daunting lack of empathy on the part of the Globalist controllers, and this is true, but how about the lack of empathy among the masses? Without common sense, there is no empathy, and the masses are sorely lacking in common sense.</p>
<p>The inability to put themselves in the shoes of others keeps the un-awoken strapped to the bed of their own egotistical, narcissism. Good luck getting through to them. They are simply incapable of being awakened in anything less than a repeatedly rough manner.</p>
<p>Russian history is chock-full of examples of these rough awakenings, and it therefore should not be so surprising that today’s Russian population is relatively more awake than those still snoozing in the pampered, declining West.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why those cast in <a title="The Age of Confusion – Mass Manipulation, Propaganda and Frequency Prisons" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/09/20/age-confusion-mass-manipulation-propaganda-frequency-prisons/">the role of Controllers</a> – along with their robotic minions – are as nasty and brutish as they are, since it falls on them to rouse Joe Sixpack in the only way he seems to understand: by shoving his face deep down into the toilet bowl of an unexamined life. Spend enough time down there, and you may finally see that all your dreams of wealth, success and material gain have just been so much meaningless crap.</p>
<p>And so the seemingly endless stream of futile chatter in the alternative media referring to the slumbering masses and how if they just had the right information is, sorry to say, nothing but pure fantasy, wishful thinking and projection on the part of the awakened, common sense minority.</p>
<p>The<em> Great Awakening</em> that many feel today, and it is palpable, is not widespread; it’s actually emanating from a very small, scattered fraction of the global population. It’s just that this small but slowly growing group of A-B-C common sense types, specialists in their own right, have a tendency, despite their incessant utilization of the common sense process, largely due to a lifetime of incessant “all men are created equal” propaganda, to erroneously project their common sense values on to the masses, and as a result are time and time again disappointed when their best intentions to rouse the herd are not taken seriously. Boo-hoo.</p>
<p>If the world was in fact brimming over with common sense, which currently it is not, reality would appear quite different than it does. No, the prison planet has been specially designed to serve the masochistic masses precisely what they need in order to evolve. It wouldn’t actually be so bad if it weren’t so damn destructive. If anything, it’s not dull.</p>
<p>As it is presented today, the Con’s “reality” is designed to stroke the mass ego consciousness with just enough happy endings to keep the machine humming and its occasionally unruly parts alternately motivated, sedated and restrained. This seems to be an unfortunate yet necessary design for an emotionally immature, Id-raging majority.</p>
<p>On the other hand, within an awakened community, no matter how small, which is not characterized by delusion but common sense, the rules of the game could not be more different. Within such a community, you can always choose another path and consciously create what you want. Life there is no longer an either/or A-B equation. You can finally transcend childish dualism as you take a quantum leap into the common sense adult world of contemplation, awareness, empathy, consciousness, comparative analysis, and synthesis. In this vitally thrilling world, A + B = C.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The goal of discourse is to create the transcendental, a higher centre of meaning outside the plurality of visions and interpretations, ‘to arrest the flow of differences, to construct a centre. ‘Thus, ‘at the base of Putin’s policies and what we shall describe as his “third way” lies the idea of a grand transcendence of so many of the conflicts that had both shaped and torn Russia in the modern era.’ -</i><a href="http://www.sras.org/deconstructing_the_millennium_manifesto" target="_blank">http://www.sras.org/deconstructing_the_millennium_manifesto</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Putin has tirelessly and with increasing success preached his neo-Gnostic common sense gospel to a Russian population that has in the not-so-distant past become familiar on an unprecedented scale with such intense suffering and pain that an increasingly large portion of them now appear eager to listen to and act upon Putin’s challenge to reclaim their common heritage as intelligent, discerning and consciously evolving individuals in a country of rich heritage and national achievement. This development on a national scale is uncommon.</p>
<p>The economic prosperity that Putin’s leadership has helped generate, impressive as it is, pales in comparison to the raising of individual consciousness <i>en masse</i> in Russia, which is what can happen to a nation when real common sense is applied to governance. That requires rare leadership qualities on a level that few in other countries have experienced in a long while.</p>
<p>What many in the West often fail to comprehend (because they lack empathy) is that when you’re the leader of a 9 time zone wide, 17 million square kilometer (6.6 million sq mi) Eurasian land mass comprised of a wide range of European, Caucasian, Asian and Indigenous cultures, in order to successfully lead and inspire such a diverse group, you must possess a Yin Yang-balanced, personal and diplomatic Swiss Army-like skill-set.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>This mixing of Western and Russian ideas is only a part of a blend of inter-discursive features adopted by Putin. It is in his co-optation of different discourses and ideas that Putin attempts to suture rifts in identity and win the war of position within discourse. It is, as some have said, a ‘third way.’</i></p>

<p>As an individual, Vladimir Putin displays many attributes of the modern Renaissance Man. He’s a vigorous yet contemplative gentleman of refinement and culture with an admiration for various art forms and a genuine appreciation for the diverse beauty and splendor of nature.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Putin enjoys hunting and fishing, it’s not part of some macho power trip to defeat and kill defenseless animals, but rather as a way for him to feel vitally connected to the natural world that we share with each other and are invited to explore if only we dare.</p>
<p>Here’s a striking passage from a May, 2011 Outdoor Life Magazine interview where Mr. Putin candidly describes his experience obtaining a whale biopsy:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><i>OL:</i></strong><i> </i><i>In August 2010, you helped scientists obtain skin samples from a whale off Russia’s Pacific Coast by darting one with a crossbow. I imagine that has to be one of the more incredible of your wildlife encounters.</i></p>
<p><em><b>VP:</b></em><i> </i><i>That was indeed an unforgettable experience, and I remember very well how impressed I was.</i></p>
<p><i>First, all that surrounded me—the low sky, the stormy sea and, of course, the whales—was magnificent. Besides, these elegant giants showed us a real performance, leaping out of the water in front of our boat.</i></p>
<p><i>Second, I was really thrilled. I do not want to offend your feelings as a hunter, but, by its intensity, its dynamics, that was a real hunt. But without killing the animal. And this was a special pleasure. This is not a melodramatic statement. That’s the way it really was.</i></p>
<p><i>We left not just to see the whales, but to take a biopsy—in other words, to dart one of the animals with a crossbow arrow, which can rip off a small part of whale skin necessary to make a special analysis. It was not that easy; three times I failed, and only the fourth attempt was successful. Of course, I could justify myself that the boat was tossing badly and that it was the first time for me to handle a crossbow, but the main reason I see was my anxiety, because participation in the scientific experiment is a very important undertaking.</i></p>
<p><em><b>OL:</b></em><i> </i><i>After you successfully darted a whale, a reporter asked you if it was dangerous. You replied that, “Living, in general, is dangerous.” Do you have any comment on that?</i></p>
<p><em><b>VP:</b></em><i> </i><i>I think what I meant by that is obvious. Despite all the achievements of civilization, the human being is still one of the most vulnerable creatures on earth. None of us is protected from crimes, epidemic outbreaks, natural and technogenic disasters. What I am saying is not a fatalistic view of the world, it is a realistic one.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Putin, with obvious empathy for the whale and a humble appreciation for the magnitude of the moment, describes in a nutshell the fragility of the human experience within a natural world that is both nurturing and fraught with risk. Unlike his ego-driven political counterparts who can never admit to any weakness, it’s a feather in his cap that he does not appear to be afraid to convey his fear and anxiety at being in the middle of what most would agree was an unsafe situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Putin seems to be implying that you might as well take risks because risk is inherent to life. To therefore feel some degree of anxiety when taking bold steps is natural, and nothing to be afraid of. Taking those bold steps is part of a personal and national awakening process.</p>

<p>…it should come as no surprise when Mr. Putin applies a calculated risk approach to diplomacy, as demonstrated by his swift response to an extraordinary early August 2013 meeting with the head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Bandar, an event first reported in the UK Telegraph and widely acknowledged in the Russian press as well as a number of other sources.</p>

<p>This colorful September 30<sup>th</sup>, 2013 recapitulation of that same fateful meeting comes courtesy of an approving Pravda opinion column, “Come the Day, Come The Hour”:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Essentially, Bandar Bush went to Putin – purportedly with the full backing of the US, and offered to cut a secret deal to carve up the oil profits if Russia would back off on Syria and allow a regime change. Putin quietly and politely offered a nyet. He was not for sale and neither were his principles. Bandar went on to then threaten Russia by turning loose Chechen terrorists to cause havoc in the Winter Sochi Olympics. Saying that all terrorists groups are under their control and that they can turn them on or off as they like. Well, it appears that at this stage, the negotiations moved from being polite – Putin warned Bandar that if Syria is attacked, Russia would bomb Saudi Arabia. At last, someone with balls. This threat was communicated to senior members of the Armed Forces with instructions to prepare to strike Saudi Arabia. Obviously, this was leaked.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/17-09-2013/125685-president_putin-0/" target="_blank">http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/17-09-2013/125685-president_putin-0/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The now famous and universally acclaimed accord on chemical weapons aside, wouldn’t it be more than likely that President Putin’s declaration of intent to bomb Saudi Arabia if Syria was attacked is the real, under-reported reason why a near-certain <a title="Media Head Games Exposed! CNN Caught Using Neuro-Linguistic Programming to Influence Syrian Conflict" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/08/30/media-head-games-exposed-cnn-caught-using-neuro-linguistic-programming-to-influence-syrian-conflict/">U.S. strike on Syria</a> was called off? Just a theory…</p>
<p>President Putin, a man of principle and a strong advocate of International Law, rejected out of hand Bandar’s pathetic bribe, since unlike many other politicians, he has principles, and can’t just be bought off.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, upon digesting Prince Bandar’s incredible admission of he and his country’s direct support for state-sponsored terrorism, despite his usual placid demeanor, President Putin’s jaw must have dropped when he received a not-so-thinly veiled threat of Olympic terrorist attack if cooperation on the Syria question was not forthcoming. President Putin rightly determined that this was not only a direct threat to Russia, but to the entire civilized world, and so he did what he had to do: stand up to the bully.</p>
<p>Only a leader so level-headed and eminently comfortable in his own skin could stare the impudent Saudi down and call his bluff in terms that were crystal clear and absolutely appropriate to the threat. Exercising his capacity for A-B-C common sense, Mr. Putin perceived, understood and decided what to do without hesitation.</p>
<p>When threatened with force, sometimes the only way to get the other party to take you seriously is to threaten them right back. That took guts and is deserving of recognition.</p>
<p>World War III was averted (for now), and Putin’s stock has deservedly risen to such a high level around the world that he was in serious contention for the Nobel Prize. The fact that he didn’t win is probably better PR than if he had won, since Obama won it for bailing out the bankers. Putin is probably ok then with an honorable mention.</p>
<p>When an individual like Vladimir Putin, who both at home and abroad is recognized as having an authentic character, repeatedly demonstrates sane, balanced actions, as he declares the rule of law and common sense governance as the goals of the nation and backs it up with corresponding actions, he naturally enjoys widespread support and trust.</p>
<p>Sadly, these common sense leadership qualities, which should be essential prerequisites for every political leader, are sorely lacking in the West, where there seems to be a permanent disconnect between common sense and politics.</p>
<p>Often unfairly lampooned in the press for his bare-chested macho man image, Mr. Putin also appears to genuinely be in touch with his feminine side.</p>
<p><img src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/putin-judo3.jpg" alt="" />As a Judo master, Putin is adept at using his opponents’ momentum against them, which can only be done by respecting the power of each “adversary,” as well as being sensitive to the flow of energy emanating from that person. A perfect example of a real world application of that principle is how President Putin “flipped” and redirected the Saudi Prince’s malevolent, threatening, violent energy right back at the Prince and synthesized the product of that energy for the purpose of creating peace.</p>
<p>Check out Putin’s judo moves here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtDQ_t-_HQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtDQ_t-_HQ</a></p>
<p>Sometimes Presidents really do need to act like car salesmen, but the car that Putin is selling is built to last and runs efficiently on common sense, common law (<i>i.e.</i> as long as you’re not hurting anyone, you’re acting within the law), and community. And that’s a vehicle more and more Russian citizens are being convinced by Putin to buy, since he drives one himself.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Putin’s manifesto is rich in inter-discursivity, appropriating elements from competing ideologies and rejecting binary oppositions in order to win the war of position within the discursive field thus creating ‘an all-national spiritual reference point that will help to consolidate society, thereby strengthening the state. This reference point, a new Russian idea, helps construct an image of the state as a nation of people represented by a spokesperson, the president.</i></p>

<p>Those of the awakened minority who are frustrated and at odds with Globalist domination strategies should find solace in the fact that the dream of a New World Order, of which much of the world is presently dreaming into reality, must according to its unnatural and unsustainable underlying principles, much like its Soviet system predecessor, inevitably collapse under the weight of its excessive absurdity.</p>
<p>And if you’re one of the small but proud members of the common sense minority community, if you haven’t already done so, please do yourselves a big favor and cease all efforts aimed at trying to wake up humanity, because it can’t be done. Instead, continue waking yourselves up.</p>
<p>Humanity can only wake itself up one individual at a time. The newly awakened, in their own time, will make connections with others without your incessant nudges. So try to let go. You’ll feel better if you do.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the West’s current political downward slope, it’s fascinating to observe the progress of Vladimir Putin in his quest to help instill and nurture a <a title="The War on Drugs and The War on Consciousness" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/01/21/the-war-on-drugs-and-the-war-on-consciousness/">return of common sense to the realm of politics</a>. It makes one hopeful that new <a title="7 Things Outstanding Leaders Do Differently" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/10/09/7-things-outstanding-leaders-differently/" target="_blank">leadership</a> possessing similar strength of character will follow President Putin’s lead.</p>
<p>Unlike Mr. Putin, we can’t all play the part of hero in this movie, although there’s no character too minor and no act too small.</p>
<p>Continue speaking your truth, get along with others, and have a good time. The rest will take care of itself.</p>
<p>That’s just plain old common sense.</p>
<p>And to close the show, Ladies and Gentlemen and Children of all ages, live from the internet, the one, the only…:</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/neworldpope-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/neworldpope-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>When this Jesuit genocidal pogrom supporter took the throne, we knew this guy was going to be a doozy. And he has peeled away from the previous pack of popes fast. After Benny Dicked Us got his marching orders and was quarantined in some hermetically sealed apartment free from prosecution, Pope Frankie went bonkers setting new precedents and getting his billions of followers used to marching to “larger tent” orders in their robotic religious paradigm.</p>
<p>Just look at this latest, which would have easily driven the “faithful” crazy in an earlier era. But hey, he’s the voice of god, so what’s to question?</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Pope Says Church Should Stop Obsessing Over Gays, Abortion</h4>
<p>Pope Francis said the Catholic Church shouldn’t be “obsessed” with preaching about abortion, gay marriage and contraception and should instead try to reach out to a broader congregation.</p>
<p>“It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time,” Francis told the <a title="Open Web Site" href="http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20130919_1.htm" rel="external">Catholic publication</a>, La Civilta Cattolica. “We have to find a new balance; otherwise even the moral edifice of the Church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel.”</p>
<p>Francis, the first non-European pope in more than 1,200 years, distinguished himself from the start of his papacy by speaking out in favor of the world’s poor. In the first six months of his papacy he’s also made overtures to other faiths and attempted to root out corruption in the Vatican Bank.</p>
<p>“He is getting back to the real values,” Veronica Chambers, 68, a practising Catholic who lives in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/los-angeles/">Los Angeles</a> said in a telephone interview. “Those of us who have any brains, us modern Catholics who need it, want it, will welcome this message.”</p>
<p>His comments marks a contrast with that of his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who struck a more conservative tone on sexuality and was criticized for not doing enough to root out sexual abuse in the clergy.</p>
<p><strong>The Church should be “the home of all,”</strong> Francis said in the 12,000-word interview conducted in August at his quarters in the Vatican guest house, which he chose over the rich papal apartments of his predecessors. [<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-19/pope-says-church-should-stop-obsessing-over-gays-abortion.html"><em>Source</em></a>]</p></blockquote>
<h4>The Church As “The Home of All”?</h4>
<p>Of course they’ve been evangelizing forever but this has a new bent. We knew he’d be an activist with his Jesuit background and our globalist state of being funneled into a new world order, but he’s moving very quickly and setting a completely different tone, and a radical new direction.</p>
<p>How? Simply check the fairly sizable goal. “Home of all.”</p>
<p>With an estimated 2.2 billion Christians on the planet and over half of these maneuverable followers remote-controlled Catholics, they are bound to be a major focus of control for the ruling psychopaths. Is it any wonder then that a “progressive” program pushing Jesuit should lead the charge into promoting the acceptance of a new world religion, using “tolerance” and “acceptance” as its platform?</p>
<p>Isn’t that the ongoing meme we’re witnessing? All while they actually exacerbate the opposite, pitting everyone against each other while preaching otherwise to push their program? Unity under their centralized control. Pretty clever these demonic entities.</p>
<h4>The NWO Religion Gets Birthed By Default</h4>
<p>What is their objective? One world everything. Militarily, their coming imposed digital currency, surveillance subjugation, control and exploitation of the masses, and a “unified” belief system? All under the guise of “no more differences – we are here to save you from all of that” – after having caused it, of course.</p>
<p>Problem, reaction, solution… on its grandest scale.</p>
<p>The religious part will be a tough one, as they know how deeply entrenched “believers” are. They have to be won over in a whole other way, or manipulated to kill each other off. Such is the Christian vs. Muslim meme being perpetrated now.</p>
<p>Very effective, and they’re at it big time and getting away with literal murder with this one.</p>
<h4>It’s Time to Wake Up</h4>
<p>Just another sign of the slumber party being perpetrated on beautiful, living humanity. We, the real people, are awake and aware of this crap and are cocked and ready to release anything and everything we can to dissipate their darkness. We have the tools of empowerment,the love, the right motives and the heart to do exactly what needs to be done at the right time.</p>
<p>So fuck you, controllers. You are virtually sleeping pawns in the very real game of life; so why don’t you wake the hell up and champion your own kind instead of the designs of the destroying matrix? What is your problem? Fear and insecurity? Just wait untill the real forces get through with you.</p>
<p>You’ll know we were right then. But too late.</p>
<p>Why not wake up now? Especially anyone under their control. I invite you.</p>
<p>That’s my message.</p>
