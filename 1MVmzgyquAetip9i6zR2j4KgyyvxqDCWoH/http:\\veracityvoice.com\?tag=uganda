&#8220;Please don&#8217;t go to Haiti &#8212; it could be dangerous down there!&#8221; several worried friends begged me right before I left.  But boy were they wrong.  Haiti is totally fun!  I never had so much fun in my life as I did this past week in Haiti.  And this is my very own tourist guidebook to all the neat stuff that I&#8217;ve done down here.  Not exactly the Lonely Planet.  But boy am I having a good time.</p>
<p>The most frequently asked question before I left was, &#8220;Are you going down there to do humanitarian work?&#8221;  No no no.  I&#8217;m going down there to be a tourist!</p>
<p>To start with, I got a really great bargain deal on Expedia &#8212; $800 to fly me from SFO to Port au Prince and five nights in a convenient, clean and quiet hotel called the Diquini Guest House.  This was absolutely the smartest thing that I did on this trip.  Why?  Because the manager of the guest house, a former member of the Haitian diaspora and long-time resident of Washington DC, took me under his wing and for a reasonable fee let me hire his driver, translated for me, kept me fed on nicely-flavored Haitian stew and rice &#8212; and then took me off to explore Port au Prince.  <a rel="nofollow">www.diquinigh.com</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>First we went to the famous Hotel Oloffson where the ghosts of past American ex-pat writers such as Graham Greene and Lillian Hellman roam its gardens, terraces and gingerbread-style balconies; where Mick Jagger and even Jacqueline Kennedy have stayed &#8212; and where the famous vudou-inspired RAM band was playing that night. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fhoteloloffson.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwYNzNI8nt1Wrpmn9lEbcT_Drzyw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hoteloloffson.com/</a></p>
<p>The next day we explored what is left of the 2010 earthquake ruins, from what was left of the tragically beautiful stone-filigreed huge rose window of the old cathedral and the site of the historic National Palace to various small tent cities dotting Port au Prince that still house earthquake victims today, and the ruined buildings that still have market stalls precariously tucked into whichever concrete slabs are still left standing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Jane, how is Port au Prince actually doing now, four years after the quake?&#8221; you might ask, now that I&#8217;m an actual eye-witness to the scene of the crime.  It&#8217;s not doing super-good, but not doing as badly as I had expected either.  Most of the tent cities are gone now &#8212; as a lot of the homeless victims have by now squashed themselves in with relatives, left for the countryside or otherwise made do.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-stqORrNRhos/UxYKkDYvCNI/AAAAAAAAI9E/8EBuZfph528/s1600/DSCN3782.JPG" width="580" height="300" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;But what are Haitians really like?&#8221; you might ask next.  You can tell what Haitians are really like by the way that they drive.  There are only a handful of traffic signals in Port au Prince and even fewer rules of the road.  And Haitians drive very fast.  But they also drive in a way that is almost polite.  Everyone wants to get where they are going (and to get there fast) &#8212; but no one wants to actually hurt anyone else.  I didn&#8217;t see any road rage there.  Just people trying to get by.</p>
<p>Basically, Haitians are just people trying to get by after having been dealt a very rough hand for a very long time, from the moment they were kidnapped from Africa and sold as slaves here &#8212; starting in 1503, just eleven years after Columbus discovered the island.  And those slaves were expendable too, worked to death in a few years at most and then replaced by other new slaves.</p>
<p>Then after having fought for and achieved its freedom in 1804, Haiti was also constantly attacked, exploited and/or invaded for the next 200-plus years by America, Canada and various combinations of European nations.  And now Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, resembling the slums of Uganda or the slums of Zimbabwe.  And yet despite their poverty, which is dire and extreme, Haitians still remain stoically polite.</p>
<p>Next we went off to the Iron Market bazaar to buy Haitian stuff to hang on my walls when I get home.  And then we drove all over Port au Prince &#8212; the grand tour.  And that night we went off to Carnival in the Carrefour district.  Are you jealous yet?</p>
<div><img alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hKF_NryJqE8/UxYJS5pucYI/AAAAAAAAI8w/dpW0IDWmYlk/s1600/DSCN3946.JPG" width="580" height="300" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>Carrefour&#8217;s pre-Lenten carnival was like one gigantic block party and was actually as much fun as Berkeley in the 1960s, the benchmark against I always measure how much fun something is.</p>
<p>I also wanted to go see San Souci and the Citadel, UNESCO world heritage sites up  in Cap Haitien, but it was a seven-hour drive to get there, so we went to Fonds des Negres instead, which was only a three-hour drive, and I met a vodou master there.  &#8220;No one is cursing you,&#8221; he told me.  Not even the NSA?  Good to know.  Then he performed a candlelight ritual to help my knees get better.  Then he pulled out a business card for his son who owns a botanica in SoCal who, for a price, could finish my <a href="http://www.felixbotanica.com/">knee treatment</a> when I got back home .<wbr></wbr>  And then the vodou master pulled out his cell phone and started texting someone.  Guess the ritual was over.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s also a cave in the mountains near Fonds des Negres where a &#8220;Suzan,&#8221; a vodou spirit, resides.  But you have to get there by motorcycle and we didn&#8217;t have time to do all that on this day trip.  So I just bought a sequin-covered vodou flag instead.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X5ejGmuFERs/UxYHnMcZHUI/AAAAAAAAI8A/c87QbZpYjrI/s1600/DSCN4052.JPG" width="200" height="150" /><br />
&#8220;Have you seen any zombies in Haiti?&#8221; might be your next question.  Sorry, no.  But on my plane ride down here, we ran into a bunch of really scary turbulence over Chicago and I thought I was going to die.  So I had an epiphany.  &#8220;When you are in your mother&#8217;s womb, the only way out is by going through a whole bunch of pain first &#8212; and death is also like that.  First you pass through a whole bunch of pain and then, poof, you are out on the Other Side.&#8221;  As a zombie?  Let&#8217;s hope not.</p>
<p>The next day we went out <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20094">searching for Jean-Bertrand Aristide</a>  and then ended the day in that famous five-star hotel in Petionville &#8212; just to see how the other 1% lives.  Trust me, they are living well.</p>
<p>What else have I done down here?  I can&#8217;t remember exactly.  But I will tell you this:  I have really had fun.  And if you ever want to go to Haiti too, I totally recommend it highly.  And, no, I&#8217;m not getting paid to say this.</p>
<p>PS:  While in Haiti, I also watched the winter Olympics on TV &#8212; thus getting a chance to compare Port au Prince and Sochi.  One city has far too little city planning and one city had far too much!</p>
<p>According to journalist Roi Tov, &#8220;With less than 350,000 denizens, [Sochi] has been occupied by at least 25,000 police officers, 30,000 soldiers, 8,000 special forces, and an undisclosed number of FSB agents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Port au Prince is nothing like that.  The streets go every which-way like a patchwork quilt.  But it does have one thing in common with Sochi &#8212; <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/immigration/2014/02/07/3256191/migrant-abuse-wage-sochi-olympics/">abuse of its fragile labor force</a>.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eZ34_YIefCo/UxYJYwkxFxI/AAAAAAAAI84/cq2WAPqnbCE/s1600/DSCN3882.JPG" width="580" height="300" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>And let&#8217;s also compare Port au Prince with Havana.  I&#8217;m currently reading Carlos Eire&#8217;s autobiography, &#8220;Learning to Die in Miami&#8221;.  Eire appears to believe with all his heart that the Castro experience was a nightmare &#8212; and yet just compare Cuba and Haiti today.  Haiti has been under the thumb of American and European corporatists for ages and ages.  And now, despite all its amazingly fertile soil and impressive mineral riches, Haiti is currently one of the poorest countries in the world.  Seven out of ten Haitians live on less than $2 a day, <a href=" http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/world/poorest-countries-in-the-world/19/  ">according to the International Red Cross</a>.</p>
<p>But in Havana under the Castro brothers, everyone has a good chance of getting a college education.</p>
<p>But, hell, most Haitians are lucky to have a chance to even get as far as fourth grade!</p>
<p>If Fulgencio Batista and the American corporatists who owned him back in 1959 had remained in power and Castro had never taken over Cuba, Cuba today would more than likely look just like Haiti today.  And does anyone with a working brain really think that having American and European oil companies, bankers, war profiteers and neo-cons in control in Syria, Venezuela and Ukraine are going to help those countries either?  Hell, just look at what those guys did to Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya &#8212; and to Detroit!</p>

</div>
<p>Imagine you go overseas and give a speech advocating a cause, only to come home and find you’re being sued for “crimes against humanity.” No, what you did wasn’t illegal under American law or under the laws of the nation in which you expressed your words.</p>
<p>You’re being sued under international law.</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker: Your case will be adjudicated by an American court.</p>
<p>Foreign law in a U.S. court?</p>
<p>This is precisely what befell Massachusetts native Pastor Scott Lively after he gave some speeches critical of homosexuality in Uganda and elsewhere. The suit was filed on behalf of activist group Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMU) by an organization with the temerity to call itself the Center for <i>Constitutional Rights</i> (CCR) (emphasis added). The legal action is based on, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/ugandan-gay-rights-group-sues-scott-lively-an-american-evangelist.html?_r=0">wrote</a> <i>The New York Times</i> in 2012, “the alien tort statute, which allows foreigners to sue in American courts in situations asserting the violation of international law.” SMU claims that Lively incited “the persecution of gay men and lesbians in Uganda,” wrote the <i>Times</i>.</p>
<p>Lively’s speechmaking hit the radar screen because the Ugandan parliament recently passed a law broadening the criminalization of homosexual activity; moreover, the pastor has also spoken in Russia, whose new law against homosexual activism has figured prominently in the reportage on the Winter Olympics in Sochi.</p>
<p>Yet this isn’t — or shouldn’t be — about what Lively did or didn’t say; it’s not about the particular. It’s about the principle:</p>
<p>American courts can adjudicate cases of American citizens sued under law (international law) that the people’s representatives did not in any way enact. Thus, Americans can conceivably be punished under legislation that they had not even an indirect hand in creating.</p>
<p>This is adjudication without representation.</p>
<p>This is an issue because last August federal judge Michael A. Ponsor rejected a motion to dismiss the Lively case filed by the pastor’s lawyers, instead allowing it to proceed to the discovery phase. This is despite the fact that, as activist group Mass Resistance <a href="http://www.massresistance.org/docs/gen2/13a/lively_hearing_010713/ruling_081413.html">reported</a>, the judge “told the CCR lawyer that he is ‘struggling to see actionable behavior’ in anything Lively did or said, and that he can&#8217;t see that any of Lively&#8217;s conduct that [sic] amounts to ‘persecution’ or ‘conspiracy.’” Nonetheless, upon issuing his 79-page ruling, writes Mass Resistance, the judge accepted “<em>all</em> of the points raised by the [George] Soros-backed plaintiffs” and denied “all of the points raised by Lively&#8217;s lawyers.”</p>
<p>Again, though, this isn’t about the facts of any particular case. It’s about using extra-constitutional means to trump Americans’ constitutional rights; it’s about seeking to use international laws and philosophy regarding “hate speech” to circumvent Americans’ First Amendment right to free speech.</p>
<p>Even staunch faux-marriage proponent and committed liberal Jonathan Rauch recognizes the danger. As he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/03/the-painful-case-of-pastor-scott-lively-homophobe-to-the-world/">wrote</a> in a Feb. 3 <i>Washington Post</i> editorial, “On the facts as I read them, the plaintiff’s theory would leave no clear line between speaking one’s mind and engaging in a criminal conspiracy, at least if speaking one’s mind could be plausibly connected to some bad outcome. That theory seems very easy to abuse.”</p>
<p>That’s the understatement of the year. Most any opinion could perhaps be connected to a bad outcome, and a multitude of opinions plausibly so. Did Barack Obama’s post-Trayvon Martin shooting statement, “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” help spark the <a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-04-27/news/os-ed-darryl-owens-trayvon-revenge-042812-20120427_1_racial-slurs-bamboo-torches-justice">revenge attacks</a> on whites that occurred after the event? Could Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) and other eco-terrorists have been influenced by the rhetoric of Al Gore and other environmentalists? And what about the constant racial grievance-mongering of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton? The fact is this: everyone who does evil was influenced by <i>someone</i>.</p>
<p>Everyone.</p>
<p>Moreover, even the expression of the most highly esteemed ideas can lead to negative outcomes (which, if the ideas are actually valid, are generally greatly outweighed by the positive ones). Will liberals consider ceasing environmental activism just because a McDonald’s, a fur store and medical-research laboratories were once firebombed? And warning of pedophilia — as I did in a soon-to-be-published piece on rampant child sex abuse in Hollywood — is always a good work. But what if someone reads my piece and then, enraged, attacks an entertainment figure or sets fire to a production studio? Should I be legally liable?</p>
<p>The Lively case is only different in that the pastor engaged in unfashionable activism. And it’s easy to see what placing Americans at the mercy of “international law” can lead to. Consider a short list of activities that could one day, under the CCR’s conception of the alien tort statute (ATS), result in Americans being tried by American courts using international law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian evangelization, even in a nation where the majority welcomed it: evangelization is illegal in certain places and frowned upon in many others. If Christianity falls into even greater disfavor in the future, spreading the faith could come to be viewed as an invidious “imposition of values.”</li>
<li>Giving a speech on what you view as the dangers of Islam in front of even a receptive foreign parliament: hate-speech laws prohibiting many types of criticism of Islam already abound in the West.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is absolutely possible — all we’d need is for the social winds to blow in the right (or wrong) direction.</p>
<p>And what of this ATS? It was enacted way back in 1789, possibly in an attempt to appease the British after they threatened to retaliate for states’ refusal to satisfy British creditors, as provided for in the treaty ending the American Revolution. This is perhaps why courts based jurisdiction on the ATS only twice between 1789 and 1980. Not surprisingly, however, it has been expanded since ‘80, with judges struggling to determine what is applicable under it. My suggestion?</p>
<p>End the struggle by rescinding the ATS.</p>
<p>Little good comes from ambiguous laws that will continually be interpreted and reinterpreted by an ever shape-shifting judiciary. And these laws almost always benefit the left. After all, conservative judges tend to be originalists who vote based on the law and put their personal beliefs aside, so they generally won’t use ambiguous legislation to advance traditionalism. Leftist judges, however, are relativists who often believe the end justifies the means, and ambiguous law is a favored vehicle through which they can impose their values from the bench.</p>
<p>I don’t think the SMU/CCR will prevail in their case against Lively — not now, anyway.  But with many American judges today having the mentality of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who once told a liberal attorneys’ group that the law profession “must start looking for inspiration beyond our borders, to the laws and constitutions of other nations,” the ability to consider international law when adjudicating should be strictly prohibited. If some foreign statute truly is a good idea, it’s up to the people to enact it through their representatives. No adjudication without representation.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/the-rapture-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/the-rapture-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>In this column last week, I stated the salient reasons why pastors will not take a public stand on issues regarded as controversial or political. I believe every point I made are the real reasons pastors refuse to stand for much of anything&#8211;or even objectively study anything outside their comfort zone. To read this column, go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18813" target="_blank">Why Pastors Won’t Take A Stand</a></p>
<p>To review, most pastors refuse to take a stand because:</p>
<p>1. They are success oriented and have an innate aversion to anything that is considered to be controversial. And, to them, there is nothing more controversial than politics.</p>
<p>2. They are afraid that if they take a controversial stand, they will lose members&#8211;and more importantly, tithes and offerings. Most churches are neck-deep in debt and are heavy-laden with staff and overhead. The thought of losing even a few giving families is enough intimidation to make sure that they do nothing to offend the people of the congregation. And since the pastor never addresses controversial issues or preaches “hard” sermons, his congregation is filled with people who harbor myriads of big-government, socialist ideas and would immediately bolt at any mention of Biblical Natural Law principles that ran counter to their leftist ideologies.</p>
<p>3. They have an erroneous interpretation of Romans 13 that civil government must be submitted to regardless of how evil or immoral its laws might be. This fallacious interpretation of Romans 13 (which is taught in practically every Christian school and college in America) has made them de facto slaves and worshippers of the state. As did Germany’s pastors and Christians in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, America’s pastors and Christians suffer from national “exceptionalism.” This fallacy leads them to believe that by serving the state, they are serving God. In their minds, one cannot be “right with God” if they are not totally submissive to the state.</p>
<p>4. The 501c3 non-profit corporation status of the Internal Revenue Code under which the vast majority of churches throughout America operate has intimidated pastors and church leaders to the point that they will do&#8211;or not do&#8211;almost anything to stay in the good graces of the IRS. To most pastors, this means staying absolutely as far away from political issues as possible&#8211;even if those issues were moral and spiritual in nature a long time before they were considered political.</p>
<p>5. Most pastors are ignorant of the Biblical Natural Law principles of liberty. In the same way that many attorneys are completely ignorant of constitutional government, pastors are completely ignorant of Biblical Natural Law principles. Attorneys are not taught constitutional principles in law school, and pastors are not taught Biblical Natural Law principles in Bible school.</p>
<p>But there is one more reason why many pastors will not take a stand that I did not address in the aforementioned column: their belief in a pre-tribulation rapture.</p>
<p>The word “rapture” does not appear in the Bible. The English word “rapture” is taken from the Latin word “rapere” and means to “catch away.” Theologically, it means that Christians will be caught away or taken to Heaven while they are still alive. There are several scriptural passages that Christians believe relate to this event, but the most cited is I Thessalonians 4:16, 17: “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up (Greek word “harpazo”) together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”</p>
<p>Of course, Christians throughout the centuries have taught and believed a variety of nuances of eschatology. The various interpretations of The Second Coming of Christ are almost limitless. There are pre-tribulational, pre-millennialists; mid-tribulational, pre-millennialists; post-tribulational, pre-millennialists; partial-rapture, pre-tribulational, pre-millennialists; post-millennialists; pre-wrath, (almost) post-millennialists; amillennialists, etc. And to each of these interpretations there is a plethora of sub-divisions and schisms.</p>
<p>Christians have historically believed that they will be resurrected to be with Christ. However, that conviction&#8211;historically and by itself&#8211;did not prevent Christians from being engaged in whatever the political, social, or cultural battles of the time might have been. From the earliest days of Christianity, believers were politically and socially engaged in their communities and countries. During the Roman Empire, a baby was not protected by law until the father granted it official human status. Until then, babies could be legally killed or allowed to die. Christians by the thousands would go out into the streets at night and rescue babies that had been “thrown away” and left to die. During the Dark Ages, when the Bible was banned, Christians continued to widely copy and distribute the scriptures. Reformers such as Ulrich Zwingli died defending Switzerland’s Protestant Reformation on the battlefield. Colonial Christians (including pastors) in great numbers participated in America’s War for Independence. The great German theologian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, joined a Nazi resistance movement. Each of these Christian believers held their individual, respective views of the Lord’s coming and personal resurrection, but this did not keep them from being politically, socially, and culturally&#8211;and sometimes militarily&#8211;involved in their communities and countries.</p>
<p>However, with the broad acceptance of what has become known as Dispensationalism, many pastors and churches in America have almost totally removed themselves from political affairs. Except for voting (which is mostly kept private), pastors avoid politics like the plague. A few will talk in very broad and general terms about America “turning back to God,” etc., but what that means specifically is seldom addressed. And if pressed for an explanation, most pastors will piously say, “God has not called me to get involved in politics.” I’m not sure that God has called them to play golf either, but that doesn’t prevent a host of them from engaging regularly in that worldly activity.</p>
<p>Dispensationalism, as it is called today, was popularized by John Darby, C. I. Scofield, and Lewis Sperry Chafer. In more modern times, John Walvoord, J. Dwight Pentecost, Charles Ryrie, Tim LaHaye, and Hal Lindsey contributed immensely to Dispensationalism’s theological acceptance. The key element of Dispensationalism, as it relates to eschatology, is the doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture of Christians. The idea is that the world is going to continue to get worse and worse until finally the Anti-Christ will arise as a global leader and will usher in seven years of “Great Tribulation,” wherein a sizeable portion of the world’s population will be destroyed. But before “The Great Tribulation” begins, Christian believers will be raptured into Heaven. Dispensationalists further believe that following the seven year Tribulation period, Christ will physically return to Jerusalem and establish a 1,000 year reign (called The Millennium) in which the Davidic Kingdom will be restored to Israel.</p>
<p>Now, let me state plainly that it is not my intention at this point to disparage the sincerity of faith and belief of the vast numbers of pastors and Christians who subscribe to Dispensationalism. Whether the pre-tribulation rapture is a correct Biblical interpretation or not is NOT the focus of this discussion. I find a sizeable number of pastors and Christians who subscribe to post-millennialism and other forms of eschatology to be just as disengaged from speaking out and engaging the political process as pre-tribulationists.</p>
<p>That being said, I believe it is an absolute fact that many pastors and Christians are using the doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture to justify sitting back and doing nothing to actively resist evil and wickedness. In their minds, there is no need to be politically involved because everything is going to get worse anyway&#8211;but they are going to be raptured to Heaven before it all falls apart. I have actually had pastors say to me, “Chuck, by resisting evil government, you are fighting against God, because it is God’s will that government gets worse and worse so that Jesus can come back.”</p>
<p>The wretchedness of this kind of thinking should be obvious to any rational person. In the first place, how arrogant are these American Christians to think that they are so special that God would have to rapture them before any real tribulation began? Think of the millions of Christians in oppressed nations throughout history&#8211;and even today&#8211;who have already been, and continue to be, IN GREAT TRIBULATION. The tribulation of Christian martyrs throughout church history is legendary. Have they never read Foxe’s Book of Martyrs? Do they not know what has taken place in southern Sudan over the last 20 years? Have they not read the history of Christians in Mao’s China, Amin’s Uganda, Pol Pot’s Cambodia, Hitler’s Germany, Stalin’s Russia, etc. Who do they think they are? Why should Christians in America be spared what Christians throughout the world have endured and are enduring? Even if their interpretation of a pre-tribulation rapture is correct, that doesn’t mean for one moment that Christians in America would not be called on to suffer great tribulation at the hands of a wicked and oppressive government&#8211;especially considering that the vast majority of pastors are doing almost nothing to resist our government from becoming wicked and oppressive. For the doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture to be used as some kind of sit-back-and-do-nothing-<wbr></wbr>because-a-divine-Seventh-<wbr></wbr>Cavalry-is-coming-to-rescue-us attitude is the height of absurdity. Dare I say it borders on blasphemy?</p>
<p>Secondly, people who use the pre-tribulation rapture doctrine as an excuse to justify being disconnected from political involvement by saying things like, “Jesus is coming soon, so it doesn’t matter!” are demonstrating either acute cowardice or immeasurable ignorance.”</p>
<p>Christians throughout the millennia have looked for the return of Jesus. The doctrine of the Second Coming of Christ has been held sacred by Christians of every generation for over two thousand years. That Jesus is coming soon doesn’t stop us from going to school and getting an education; it doesn’t stop us from going to work every day to earn a living; it doesn’t stop us from planning our financial futures or saving for retirement; it doesn’t stop us from teaching and training our children; it doesn’t stop us from learning and exercising personal skills; it doesn’t stop us from locking our doors or buying expensive alarm systems to protect us from the bad guys; and it doesn’t stop these disconnected pastors from spending years trying to perfect their golf game. Neither should it stop us from preserving the liberties and freedoms of our nation.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the Old Testament king of Judah, Hezekiah. He was told by the prophet that God was going to judge his country with great oppression, but that it would not happen until after he expired, some 15 years later. Hearing that, Hezekiah said (paraphrase), “Oh goodie! At least it won’t happen while I’m alive.”</p>
<p>I ask you, what kind of father and grandfather would rather see his own children and grandchildren endure persecution and oppression than him do something in his lifetime to prevent it? What kind of uncaring, hard-hearted, pleasure-mad sorry-excuses-for-manhood are we that we would not want to sacrifice our own comfort, our own possessions, our own lives, in order to provide something better for our children and grandchildren?</p>
<p>These stand-for-nothing pastors do NOT know when Jesus is coming. And they do not know what kind of tribulation their children and grandchildren are going to endure at the hands of future tyrants and despots because they refused to do something that could have prevented it.</p>
<p>Our Christian forebears believed in the return of Christ and in personal resurrection. Whether they were pre-millennial, post-millennial, pre-tribulational, mid-tribulational, post-tribulational, etc., they didn’t allow their personal interpretation of Bible prophecy keep them from doing what was the right thing to do when it was in their power to do it. They were statesmen, leaders, and even warriors. They worked; they dug; they studied; they taught; they led; and they fought. And when needed, they risked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.</p>
<p>Are we really more spiritual than were they? Are we really more studied? More intelligent? More dedicated? More sincere? More courageous? Or more Christ-like?</p>
<p>How dare this generation of spoiled, lazy, comfort-laden, cowardly, sheepish, success-motivated, passive pulpits sit in judgment on the Christian men and women of history who, regardless of their personal interpretation of eschatology, actively engaged in the social, cultural, and, yes, political affairs of their countries&#8211;and helped bequeath to us, their posterity, a free and independent land? How dare they use the doctrine of the rapture as an excuse to justify their own indifference? And more importantly, how dare Christians tolerate such cowardice and carnality?</p>
<p>Thirdly, Dispensationalists allow their interpretation of Bible prophecy relating to future Israel to obfuscate the divine principles of liberty as it relates to present America. Preachers such as John Hagee have twisted the scriptures to support almost unlimited wars of aggression against Middle Eastern countries in the name of befriending Israel. In reality, unconstitutional war, nation-building, foreign interventionism, etc., is no friend to Israel, the United States, or any other country.</p>
<p>America’s foreign policy is a global nightmare. It has made enemies where none existed. It has made it increasingly difficult for American missionaries to give the Gospel to people in foreign countries. In many countries, it has inflamed the persecution of Christians. It has greatly contributed to the economic bankruptcy of the United States. It has turned the affections of the world against us. It has turned many American Christians from peacemakers to warmongers. Under the rubric of the “war on terror,” America is being turned into a giant police state. In truth, the Warfare State that has been created in this country is not a blessing to Israel (or any other country), but a curse. But the Dispensationalists’ interpretation of prophecy tends to blind them to these maladies.</p>
<p>Yes, many pastors and Christians have a rapture problem. But the problem is not really the doctrine itself but the way it is misapplied. I know pastors of all theological and eschatological backgrounds who are actively engaged in the freedom fight; and I know pastors of all theological and eschatological backgrounds who are disengaged from the freedom fight. It’s up to the man. If men want to, they can hide behind anything. And when pastors choose to hide behind the rapture, it becomes a problem for all of us.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/medicalsystem3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/medicalsystem2.jpg" align="left" /></a>I do not want to pretend that this is an impartial investigation. Instead I am now fully convinced that most diseases are indeed caused by the medical system, and in the following I want to state my reasons for this conclusion.</p>
<p>Increasingly over the years my health beliefs have been turned around. I started out by working as a biochemist and toxicologist in university medical departments fully believing that all these chronic and incurable diseases are indeed incurable and generally of unknown origin, but that pharmaceutical drugs made life easier for patients and often were even curative. My re-education started after immigrating to New Zealand and learning about natural healing and living; this made me realize that disease is mainly caused by unnatural living conditions and can be overcome by natural methods of living and healing.</p>
<p>While I learned about the harmful nature of drug treatment, I was still thinking of it as being ineffective and causing side-effects rather than as a main cause of our diseases. Diseases caused by medical treatment are called <i>iatrogenic</i> diseases. The total number of iatrogenic deaths in the USA for 2001 is estimated to be 783,936. These were due to fatal drug reactions, medical error and unnecessary medical and surgical procedures. With this, the medical system is the leading cause of death and injury in the United States. In comparison the 2001 heart disease death rate was 699,697 and the annual cancer death rate 553,251 (1).</p>
<p>This is also the reason why it is so beneficial for patients when doctors go on strike. Statistics show that whenever there was a strike by doctors, the death rate in the affected population fell dramatically. In 1976 the death rate fell by 35 per cent in Bogotá, Colombia. In Los Angeles County,California, it fell by 18 per cent during a strike in the same year, while in Israel it fell by 50 per cent during a strike in 1973. Only once before was there a similar drop in the death rate in Israel and that was during another doctors&#8217; strike 20 years earlier. After each strike the death rate jumped again to its normal level (2).</p>
<p>However these figures of iatrogenic deaths do not take into account iatrogenic diseases from the long-term harm done by medical treatments where patients survive but with a chronic disease. My real awakening to this problem started when I became aware of the story of Orion Truss who discovered the Candidiasis-causing potential of antibiotics.</p>
<p><b>Dr Orian Truss</b></p>
<p>In 1953 Dr Orian Truss discovered the devastating effects of antibiotics in an Alabama (USA) hospital (3). During a ward round Truss was intrigued by a gaunt, apparently elderly man who was obviously dying. However, he was only in his forties and in hospital for four months. No specialist had been able to make a diagnosis. Out of curiosity Truss asked the patient when be was last completely well.</p>
<p>The man answered that he was well until six months before when he had cut his finger. He had received antibiotics for this. Shortly afterwards he developed diarrhoea and his health deteriorated. Truss had seen before how antibiotics cause diarrhoea. It was known that Candida was opportunistic and thrived in debilitated patients, but now Truss wondered if it might not be the other way round, that Candida actually caused the debilitated condition.</p>
<p>He had read that potassium iodide solution could be used to treat Candida infestation of the blood. So he put the patient on six to eight drops ofLugol&#8217;s solution four times a day for 3 weeks and soon the patient was again completely well.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards he had a female patient with a stuffy nose, a throbbing headache, vaginitis and severe depression. To his amazement all her problems immediately cleared with Candida treatment. Some time later he saw a female patient who had been schizophrenic for six years with hundreds of electroshock treatments and massive drug dosages. He started treating the woman for sinus allergies with a Candida remedy. Soon she had recovered mentally and physically, and remained well.</p>
<p>From then on he treated his patients against Candida at the slightest indication of its presence. Many of his patients made remarkable recoveries from most unusual conditions, including menstrual problems, hyperactivity, learning disabilities, autism, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and auto-immune diseases such as Crohn&#8217;s disease and lupus erythematosus.</p>
<p>Every experienced naturopath can relate similar success stories. Also some alternative medical practitioners have realized the curative potential of anti-Candida therapy, as for instance Dr William Crook who wrote several books about the successful treatment of allergies and hyperactive children (4).</p>
<p><b>The Antibiotic Syndrome</b></p>
<p>Candidiasis is not the only side-effect of antibiotic treatment, and antibiotics are not the only drugs that cause such problems. Drugs used in chemotherapy, anti-inflammatory steroidal drugs and other long-term drug therapies tend to kill or suppress the natural intestinal bacteria, and yeast, parasites and harmful bacteria start taking over. This is then called dysbiosis. Most patients receive such drugs in hospitals and can be expected todevelop systemic Candida overgrowth as a result.</p>
<p>Our natural intestinal flora, mainly based on lactobacteria, not only helps to digest and absorb food, it also protects us against ingested harmful bacteria that otherwise may cause food poisoning. With a healthy intestinal flora millions of salmonella bacteria may be needed to cause an infection but with dysbiosis only tens of salmonella would be required.</p>
<p>With chronic dysbiosis the intestinal wall becomes inflamed, causing ulcers, appendicitis, malabsorption and Crohn’s disease, and as the intestinal membrane erodes we develop multiple food allergies, arthritis and autoimmune diseases. In addition to Candida also other pathogens and parasites now invade the bloodstream and various organs. With live cell analysis natural therapists can see and show their patients the fungi in their blood. This invasion greatly weakens the immune system so that people now become susceptible to frequent or chronic infections. Commonly this is then treated with more antibiotics, which continues to intensify the symptoms.</p>
<p>Actually, the problem is not with the antibiotics. You can take a course if you feel it is needed, provided that you take a fungicide, such as fresh garlic, at the same time, and have some probiotics after the antibiotic and before you ingest any carbohydrates. This will prevent most diseases that are caused by the careless medical method of using antibiotics. For more details see <a href="http://www.health-science-spirit.com/candida.html">Candida and the Antibiotic Syndrome</a>.</p>
<p><b>Autoimmune Diseases and Asthma</b></p>
<p>Autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, lupus erythematosus and pancreatitis, have been linked to dysbiosis. When remedies are given that bind bacterial endotoxins, these conditions usually improve. In addition autoimmune diseases have been shown to be linked to mycoplasmas ornanobacteria which start to develop from diseased red blood cells in the presence of toxic chemicals and systemic Candida. The weaker our immune system becomes, the more these mycoplasms start to develop into bacterial and finally fungal forms. They have been found in all autoimmune diseases, cancers and AIDS (5).</p>
<p>Antibiotics are also a major contributing cause of asthma. Children who received broad-spectrum antibiotics were about 9 times more likely to suffer from asthma (6). A recent research paper confirmed dysbiosis as a main cause of asthma (7)</p>
<p>In the 1980’s New Zealand had the highest rate of asthma deaths in the world. This was drastically reduced when in 1991 the inhaler drug Fenoterolwas banned as it caused a 13 times higher risk of dying (8). This reduction in the asthma death rate was generally hailed as a great triumph for medical science. Other studies revealed that asthmatics using more than one bronchodilator inhaler a month had a fifty-fold increased risk of suffering a fatal asthma attack.</p>
<p>In addition to asthma, I also see the combination of pasteurized cow’s milk with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in babies and infants as the main cause of their frequent infections, glue ear and greatly contributing to cot or crib death. Because health authorities insist on pasteurizing milk, and doctors prescribe antibiotics without the most basic precautions, I regard asthma and most childhood infections as predominantly iatrogenic diseases.</p>
<p>In the ‘good old days’ people ingested a lot of lactic acid fermented foods and raw milk products that replenished our ‘good’ bacteria, and because antibiotics had not been invented, dysbiosis and therefore chronic diseases were rare. Instead people mainly died from acute infections due to unhygienic living conditions, and in the slums also from malnutrition.</p>
<p><i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>or golden staph causes serious infections in hospital patients. It has been found that not only golden staph but also other infections are greatly potentized when they occur combined with Candida overgrowth. As Candida overgrowth is a natural outcome of the standard hospital treatment, it is easy to see why golden staph is so deadly in hospitals.</p>
<p>A similar picture emerges with AIDS. People do not die from the AIDS virus but from Candida or fungal-potentized bacterial and mycoplasmainfections. The end stage of AIDS is the same as the end stage of cancer. It is called cachexia, a wasting condition mainly caused by fungal overgrowth. Lugol’s iodine solution and other systemic fungicides should do wonders for it. Presently also MMS, a 28% solution of sodium chlorite, is gaining acceptance as an effective antimicrobial remedy (see <a href="http://miraclemineral.org/">http://miraclemineral.org</a>).</p>
<p>All of this shows that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and Candida are not isolated and relatively harmless problems as the medical profession prefers to believe, but rather the underlying cause of most of our modern diseases.</p>
<p><b> Cancer and Leukemia</b></p>
<p>One hundred years ago the rate of cancer was very low. I have no doubt that the phenomenal increase in the use of agricultural and industrial chemicals as well as pharmaceutical drugs has greatly accelerated the increase in the rate of cancer, and there is also a link to the consumption of sugar.  Even stronger is the link to dysbiosis and Candida.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy commonly leads to systemic Candida infections, which greatly limit the success rate of the treatment. Long-term follow-up studies show that children develop 18 times more secondary malignant tumors later in life, girls face a 75 times higher risk of breast cancer by the time they are 40 (9), while the risk of developing leukemia after chemotherapy for ovarian cancer increased 21-fold. Also other tumors commonly develop after treating malignancies with chemotherapy (10). A main problem appears to be the development of deep or systemic Candida<i> </i>infections shortly after starting chemotherapy (11).</p>
<p>Only recently have oncologists started to acknowledge what patients called “chemo-brain”, a distressing loss of memory and other cognitive functions.  Psychiatrists have now found that the conventional treatment of cancer causes serious depression in 15 to 25 percent of patients. &#8220;The depression itself can often be worse than the disease&#8221; they say (12). Brain fog and depression are common with systemic Candida.</p>
<p>All of this shows that chemotherapy tends to cause leukemia and cancer many years later mainly as a result of dysbiosis and systemic Candida. The reason for the widespread use of chemotherapy despite its lack of effectiveness, severe side effects, and long-term cancer promotion can be seen in the fact that private-practice oncologists (in the US) typically derive two-thirds of their income from selling chemotherapy to patients (13).</p>
<p>This chemotherapy connection makes it very likely that dysbiosis and systemic Candida can also cause cancer and leukemia when they are caused as a result of antibiotic treatment. The rate of cancer really accelerated only after the use of antibiotics became widespread.</p>
<p>There is also more direct evidence that Candida and other fungi are a cause of leukemia. Meinolf Karthaus, MD, reported several children with leukemia going into remission upon receiving antifungal remedies for their ‘secondary’ fungal infections (14). In his lifetime work Milton White, MD, was able to find fungal spores in every sample of cancer tissue he studied (15).</p>
<p>Fungal infections have been diagnosed and treated as leukemia, and leukemia has disappeared on grain-free diets, presumably because of the high content of mycotoxins in grains (16).</p>
<p>The Italian oncologist Dr. Tullio Simincini claims a success rate of up to 90% by treating cancer as a fungus. He infuses tumors with sodium bicarbonate solution and recommends taking bicarbonate in water to get rid of gastro-intestinal tumors (17).</p>
<p>Recently I received a personal communication that a large stomach tumor had unexpectantly shrunk after swallowing some mouthwash for a few weeks for a different problem. The main ingredient of this mouthwash was benzoic acid, a strong fungicide that inhibits the metabolism of fungal cells. Cancer cells have the same fungal-type metabolism which thrives on high levels of glucose and insulin, and they may therefore be regarded as a kind of fungal cells.</p>
<p>While the work of the German Dr Ryke Geerd Hamer (18) shows that emotional shock is a major trigger for the development of cancer, a weak immune system as caused by intestinal dysbiosis, systemic Candidiasis, toxic chemicals, and root canal treatments appears to be an essential co-factor. After all, a century ago people must have had a similar number of emotional shocks as at present, but cancer was very rare. Conversely, there are lots of people with dysbiosis and root canals that do not have cancer, but add emotional shock, and voilà!</p>
<p><b>Root Canals</b></p>
<p>Root-canal filled teeth are a variation of the theme of intestinal dysbiosis. They, too, appear to be a major contributing factor in many health problems, not only cancer but also heart disease, arthritis, kidney disease and auto-immune diseases. This is due to microbes that multiply in the multitude of tiny canals or tubules in the dentine and gradually leach out into the lymph system. Even normally harmless microbes become very dangerous and more virulent and toxic under the anaerobic conditions in dead teeth.</p>
<p>Dr Weston Price (19), a former Director of Research for the American Dental Association, observed that the removal of root-filled teeth from patients with kidney or heart disease would in most cases lead to an improvement. When he then inserted a removed root-filled tooth under the skin of a rabbit it would die within 2 days. When he implanted normal teeth there was no adverse health effect. In some experiments he implanted the same fragments of root-filled teeth in succession under the skins of up to 100 rabbits and they all died within 2 weeks of the same disease that the human donor had!</p>
<p>Dr Price conducted about 5,000 experiments over 25 years. He did not find a reliable method to disinfect dead teeth and make them safe. His research has been suppressed, and if at all mentioned by our dental associations then they are described as “dated” because this research was conducted and published over 70 years ago but it has never been repeated or otherwise investigated, or root canals shown to be safe.</p>
<p>The main argument for their supposed safety is that millions of people have them and are still alive many years later. The question of root canals causing widespread degenerative diseases is not discussed or researched. Price found that about 30% of individuals have such a strong immune system that they do not develop problems from root canals until they become old but the remaining 70% develop problems much sooner.</p>
<p>I regard root canals, even more so then intestinal dysbiosis, as a major cause of autoimmune diseases. In 1993 George E. Meinig, DDS, a formerUS root canal specialist, re-published the dental research of Dr Price in a popular version, and included his own experiences (20).</p>
<p><b>Iatrogenic Heart Attacks</b></p>
<p>One hundred years ago heart attacks were almost unknown despite diets generally being high in saturated fats. The ascent of heart attacks began with the pasteurization of milk and the use of chlorine to kill bacteria in public water supplies. This began around 1900 and was generally accepted in Western countries in the l920&#8242;s. From 1920 onwards the explosive increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and fatal heart attacks began, but only in countries that chlorinated their water supplies. These diseases remained unknown, for instance, in Africa, China, Japan, and other parts of ASIA. However, when Japanese citizens immigrated to Hawaii where water was chlorinated, they suffered the same rate of heart attacks as the Americans, and the black population in the US have the average US rate of heart attacks but not their brothers in Africa. Inhabitants of the non-chlorinated Roseto in Pennsylvania remained free of heart attacks unless they moved to a chlorinated area (21).</p>
<p>Some of the chlorine reacts with organic impurities in water to form organochlorins (DDT is an Organo-chlorine) while the rest remains as residual free chlorine in the water. It may then react either with food chemicals or with parts of our digestive tract. In 1967 a Dr J. Price in the US performed a decisive experiment. With one group of 50<b><i> </i></b>three-month-old chickens (cockerels) he added one third of a teaspoon of chlorine bleach to about one litre of water whilst another group of 50 chickens served as controls. Seven months later over 95 per cent of the chlorinated group had advanced atherosclerosis, yet none of the control group showed any such evidence.</p>
<p>In the following years Dr Price repeated his experiment many times, always with the same results, and more recently even researchers funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency have confirmed atherosclerotic type changes in other animals, including monkeys, when exposed to chlorinated water (22).</p>
<p><b>Drugs and Chemicals</b></p>
<p>Basically all drugs are more or less toxic, the more so, the more ‘powerful’ they are. Natural remedies cannot be patented, therefore in order to maximize profits the pharmaceutical industry routinely makes and sells synthetic versions of effective natural remedies. Synthetic substances are usually more difficult to detoxify than natural remedies and tend to create more problems the longer they are taken. Often they become highly addictive and after some time may cause the symptoms that they originally alleviated. This, however, is rarely acknowledged by drug companies or medical practitioners, instead when a problem arises simply alternative or additional drugs are prescribed.</p>
<p>A main problem is that drugs are tested individually for relatively short periods, but are then prescribed as drug cocktails for very long periods. Drugs have not been tested under these conditions, and therefore all drug use, except as individual drugs for short periods, is unscientific and unsafe. As a result of this, there are countless dangerous and fatal drug interactions and side-effects as reported in numerous books, articles and statistics.</p>
<p>It is similar with the thousands of synthetic chemicals and heavy metals that are allowed by health authorities to contaminate our living space. These are even less tested than drugs but also react with each other and with drugs in a brew that is impossible to disentangle.</p>
<p>I want to mention just one instance of such a combination. The herbicide paraquat<b> </b>and the fungicide maneb are widely used in farming and may remain present as crop residues. Each on its own did not cause a problem but if rats and mice were exposed to both together, even at very low rates, they developed symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.  The leader of the research team said: &#8220;No one has looked at the effects of studying together some of these compounds that, taken by themselves, have little effect. This has enormous implications,&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8217;s a huge problem to start thinking about a nearly infinite array of mixtures of chemicals, instead of the risk that a single chemical might pose&#8221; (23).</p>
<p>We have similar problems with fluoride and chlorine as well as mercury, aluminium, nickel and other heavy and toxic metals being deliberately put into vaccines and used in dentistry. For a detailed documentation of the problems associated with heavy metals and endocrine disrupting chemicals see Bernard Windham (24).</p>
<p><b>Sunlight</b></p>
<p>Health authorities and medical associations have campaigned strongly to avoid sun exposure of the skin. Presumably this causes skin cancer, including melanoma that can kill. However, the vast majority is normal skin cancer that almost never kills, and there is widespread doubt that melanomas are really caused by normal sun exposure, although there seems to be a link with sunburn. Generally outdoor workers with the most sun exposure had the lowest rates of skin cancer and melanoma, while melanomas often show up in office workers. Melanoma often occurs on areas of the skin that had not been exposed to sunlight. Other studies show a strong link between long-term exposure to fluorescent lighting and melanoma (25). With the present campaign to replace all incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent ones, I expect a melanoma epidemic in ten to twenty years (26).</p>
<p>Now more and more research papers show that a vast number of diseases, and especially cancer, could be avoided by greatly increasing our levels of vitamin D with suitable foods, supplements, and frequent or daily short sun exposure of the skin. Sunlight is our main source of vitamin D. Research shows that there is a strong negative correlation between available sunlight and breast cancer death rates &#8211; living in a sunny area is associated with lower cancer rates. Even skin cancer is inhibited by regular low-level sun exposure; only sunburn is a strong skin cancer promoter. It has now been calculated that with these measures worldwide about 600,000 cases of colon and breast cancer could be prevented (27).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the researchers pointed out that by increasing levels of vitamin D3 by regular sun exposure and other measures we could prevent diseases that claim nearly 1 million lives throughout the world each year (28, 29).</p>
<p>The irony of all this is that the present skin cancer epidemic has, in my opinion, been manufactured by our health authorities and medical experts. There are three conditions that make us susceptible to develop skin cancers with high sun exposure. These are overacidity, a high ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, and a lack of antioxidants. The most common cause of overacidity is Candida overgrowth, especially in combination with the officially recommended diet high in cereals. Our omega-6 to omega-3 ratio was always somewhat too high but it went off the chart when our health authorities recommended replacing saturated fats with seed oils high in omega-6 fatty acids. This increased inflammatory conditions of all kinds, including tumors and skin cancers. To make matters worse, health authorities also discourage and legally minimize the use of antioxidant nutrients.</p>
<p>With these measures health authorities created the conditions for an epidemic of skin cancers. Then they tried to prevent skin cancers by recommending complete avoidance of sun exposure, which in turn caused large-scale vitamin D deficiency with an estimated loss of 1 million lives each year. I sometimes ask myself if it is simply ignorance and incompetence or if there is something more sinister to it.</p>
<p><b>The Obesity epidemic     </b></p>
<p>I could write a book about all the health problems caused by the medical-pharmaceutical complex and the neglectful way in which health authorities contribute to our diseases. In addition to directly causing diseases, these same forces also prevent the healing of these same diseases by restricting, suppressing and persecuting the practitioners of natural medicine as well as giving disease-causing nutritional advice.</p>
<p>Until 1980 the rate of obesity and Type 2 diabetes was fairly stable. However, when health authorities in the U.S.A. started vilifying foods containing fats and cholesterol, and recommended eating more carbohydrates instead, obesity increased from 15% of the adult U.S. population to 25% within one decade and continued to rise to 32.9% in 2003-2004 (30). Type 2 diabetes became an epidemic as well. In addition, for the first time in history a large number of obese children developed Type 2 diabetes. Since then it is no longer called maturity-onset diabetes. Also children start now developing Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes simultaneously (31, 32, 33). All of these are iatrogenic diseases, caused by the medical system.</p>
<p>Natural practitioners are experts in preventing and successfully treating chronic diseases with nutrition and other natural methods. This includes the metabolic syndrome which leads to diabetes, heart disease and overweight. It is routinely and quickly remedied with proper nutrition, but with accepted medical practice it becomes a life-long condition managed with more or less toxic drugs. Surgery is used for a wide range of conditions, and patients are severely traumatized or mutilated for life when these problems could be successfully treated with natural therapies.</p>
<p><b>Vaccinations</b></p>
<p>Vaccinations are the proud showpiece of drug medicine in eliminating the dreaded childhood infections of previous centuries. However, long-term statistics and diagrams tell a different story. Starting between 1850 and 1900 scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, and measles had declined by about 90% by the time general vaccination was introduced for each disease. While statistics vary between different countries, this is generally true for England, the United States and Australia. Whooping cough had declined in England by about 98.5% before a vaccine became generally available, and measles had declined by over 99%. Tuberculosis had declined by 87% when antibiotics first became available and by 93% before the introduction of the BCG vaccine. The death rate from rheumatic fever had declined by 86% when penicillin was introduced (34). All of this has obviously more to do with better plumbing than with vaccinations.</p>
<p>There are also statistics showing that death rates from targeted diseases rose with the introduction of vaccines. Other side-effects ascribed to modern vaccines are cot or crib death (SIDS), a strong rise in autism and ADHD, and shaken baby syndrome (spot bleeding in the brain) which apparently landed innocent parents in jail. Experts strongly deny that there is a connection between vaccines and autism, but it is strange nevertheless that the rates of autism have suddenly exploded after greatly increased numbers of vaccinations in recent decades, and there is no obvious alternative reason. Also autism is absent in Amish children who are generally not vaccinated. Vaccinated children are reported to have about 150% more neurological disorders such as ADHD and autism compared to unvaccinated children (35).</p>
<p>Another curios aspect of vaccine safety statistics was highlighted by Dr Archie Kalokerinos. Working in the remote Australian outback with Aboriginals he found that every second child died as a result of vaccinations. Because deaths commonly occurred about 3 weeks later, they were not recorded as vaccine-related; officially reactions were limited to occur only for up to 2 weeks after vaccination. However, eventually Dr Kalokerinossolved the problem by giving babies high doses of vitamin C before vaccinations, and no more vaccination deaths occurred. Also SIDS disappeared. Naturally he encountered ridicule and hostility from his medical colleges, and babies are still dying needlessly (36).</p>
<p><b>Deliberate Bias Against Natural Therapies</b></p>
<p>It has become a habit that any successful natural cancer remedy or treatment is quickly outlawed by our health authorities. Many natural health practitioners have been dragged before the courts and often imprisoned, especially in the area of cancer treatment (37). This is especially regrettable because there is no evidence that the methods of orthodox cancer therapy are in any way successful (38).</p>
<p>One of the methods increasingly used to denigrate natural therapies is for the pharmaceutical industry to finance shoddy research on natural remedies and then proclaim them to be ineffective or harmful. This is only partly intended to influence the general public but mainly to provide the justification for health authorities to outlaw and greatly restrict natural remedies (39).</p>
<p>Another strategy is not to list favorable vitamin studies in the MEDLINE database. This is taxpayer-funded and operated by the US National Library of Medicine. It lists all articles by medical research journals, including Time magazine and Readers&#8217; Digest, but not the peer-reviewed Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine (<a href="http://www.orthomed.org/jom/jomlist.htm">http://www.orthomed.org/jom/jomlist.htm</a>) which specializes in vitamin research. Now the British Medical Journal has published a letter about Medline bias (40) and this has forced Medline to index articles on Medline bias.</p>
<p>Because all these favorable vitamin studies are not indexed by Medline, proponents of drug medicine can claim that there are no studies that show that vitamins are useful in the treatment of diseases or that they are safe in high doses, and therefore should be restricted to very low doses. Of course, world-wide yearly fatalities due to vitamins are zero; in comparison drug fatalities are infinitely higher.</p>
<p>30 years ago Linus Pauling showed that high doses of vitamin C are beneficial in cancer treatment. This has been ‘disproved’ by the orthodoxy ever since. But now a study by conventional Johns Hopkins scientists has shown that he was right (41). In addition, the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine has just published a double-blind, randomized clinical trial showing that HIV-positive patients given supplemental nutrients can stop their decline into AIDS (42). This would pose a big threat to the medical-pharmaceutical complex and is one more reason not to index this journal on Medline.</p>
<p>There exists a systemic culture of suppression of dissenting views in science and medicine, and frequently a vicious persecution with “Gestapo-like” methods (43, 44). Recently in the US even a mother has been jailed and brutalized for “illegally” using natural methods to cure her son of malignant melanoma (45).</p>
<p>Of course, this assault of the medical-pharmaceutical complex on natural healing methods is not illegal. On the contrary, in a capitalist system it is their duty to maximize profits by eliminating the competition and generating a steady supply of patients with chronic diseases who can be managed indefinitely with drugs. The question is just why do government health authorities make and enforce laws on behalf of drug medicine and against natural medicine?</p>
<p>Theoretically they should be impartial and ensure the best outcome for the population. I believe the answer can be found in some good lateral thinking by the pharmaceutical industry. By paying for and influencing much of the medical education (46, 47, 48), they automatically produce health officials and government advisers who are steeped in pharmaceutical thinking and biased against natural medicine. No bribery is needed, but health officials always know that there is a well-paid job waiting if and when they want to retire from government service, simple!</p>
<p><b>Natural Medicine to the Rescue</b></p>
<p>Health authorities so far have ignored the claims and evidence of natural medicine that it is the superior form of treatment for chronic and medically incurable diseases. The very fact of a high rate of chronic disease in our society attests to the inability of the medical profession to successfully treat these diseases. I have no doubt that natural medicine could eliminate most chronic diseases within a decade, needing only a few percent of the money that is spent on conventional medicine. The knowledge is already available; no expensive high-tech research is needed that may or may not give results sometime in the future.</p>
<p>There is a simple low-cost solution for bringing about the healing of our society:</p>
<p>1.   Phase out public assistance for pharmaceutical companies and their research, and require research to show that a drug is safe with long-term use in combination with other common drugs and chemicals and with old or fragile patients, or alternatively that it is superior in the long-term to available natural treatments</p>
<p>2.   Make it illegal for pharmaceutical companies to fund medical education or provide drug information, marketing or incentives directly to the public or to medical practitioners, or to employ former health officials. Information to medical practitioners should be provided by an independent and impartial body</p>
<p>3.   Except for unethical conduct according to general society standards, make it illegal for medical associations to restrict the therapies used by their members</p>
<p>4.   Afford qualified practitioners of natural medicine the same recognition and opportunities as those of drug medicine, including in hospitals, rehabilitation, research and publications, health departments and regulating authorities</p>
<p>So far our medical and economic leaders do not want to face reality. They brainwash the public into believing that the present health situation is completely normal. Importantly, the whole economic structure of Western civilization is based on the production and distribution of goods and services that are contributing to poor health. These include chemicalized agriculture and food processing, the pharmaceutical industry, technological medicine and the petrochemical and plastics industries.</p>
<p>The guiding motto for industry is &#8216;profit&#8217;, while for the consumer it is &#8216;convenience&#8217;. The price for all to pay is the loss of health. This situation is the natural outcome of a society based on selfish motivation. A change for the better can only come when more and more people realize that ultimately they harm themselves with selfish attitudes, and start electing leaders who are prepared to act in a compassionate and cooperative way in the interest of the whole society. We get what we choose: natural health or enduring drug management.</p>

<em>UN Gun Control(Pictured: Twisted Gun sculpture outside of U.N. Headquarters. New York City, USA)</em></p>
</div>
<p>Inch by inch it is a cinch. The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. Many planners realize that nothing monumental is quickly achieved and dogged persistence over time is needed to overcome obstacles in the pursuit of a valued goal.</p>
<p>Nobody has utilized the principle of incrementalism better than the globalists in the pursuit of their goals related to the establishment of the New World Order.</p>
<p>Gun Confiscation has begun. In two different geographical locations in two differing countries, the authorities have confiscated guns without probable cause or the exigent circumstances required by constitutional law. But alas, I almost forgot, there is no rule of law in the United States. There is not one amendment in the Constitution that has been left intact.</p>
<p>Can there be any doubt that the United Nations is behind these gun grabs? How do we know that the United Nations is behind this beta test related to the disarming of private citizens? Read about the United Nations intent to control all guns here. I implore that all of you heed this warning and use it as a guiding principle in the months and years ahead. The United Nations is the enemy of humanity. I have this rogue organization, which is controlled by mafia bankers, in my sights and am planning to expose their anti-humanist agenda to all that will listen with an open mind. The United Nations is behind national health care which is going to bankrupt millions in this country, or result in the early demise of millions of people through treatment exclusions and denial of care. The UN (UNESCO) is behind the sabotaging of the American education system in such ill-conceived programs as No Child Left Behind and now Common Core. And the United Nations seeks to disarm all citizens prior to enacting their planned nightmarish tyranny upon the world.</p>
<p>Listen to me America, the United Nations is your mortal enemy!</p>
<p>Tyrants Always Seize the Guns Before Subjugating the People</p>
<p>We all know that the American Revolution commenced with British troops marching on Lexington and Concord in order to seize the arms of the colonial resistance to the tyranny of King George. The British were soundly defeated as the colonists vigorously defended their only means available to stand up to the British.</p>
<p>Let the record show that upon this moment, history is indeed repeating itself as the UN backed ideology is rearing its ugly head and attempting to disarm citizens without using due process of law.</p>
<p>Lexington, Canada</p>
<p>Floodwaters prompted the evacuation of 13,000 residents in a small Canadian town. Following the evacuation, the authorities took it upon themselves to rummage through the personal possessions of the local residents and seize all the guns they could find.</p>
<p>The 13,000 residents of High River, Alberta, are still waiting for the authorities’ permission to return to their homes. Dozens of High River residents have actively confronted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at a checkpoint at the edge of their small town since floodwaters prompted a forced evacuation last week. The RCMP have posted private guards on trails leading to the town. They have placed spike strips on the roads leading into town. Apparently, the RCMP authorities are not done looting the possessions of their citizens.</p>
<p>This is the Lexington moment in world events. As was the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, so too, is the first of the beta tests for UN inspired gun confiscation.</p>
<p>Concord, Arizona</p>
<p> Arizona is experiencing a Concord event. And as you will witness, that this time, the patriots at Lexington (High River, Canada) and at Concord have failed (Arizona) and the tyrants have won.</p>
<p>“If a law enforcement officer contacts a person who is in possession of a firearm, the law enforcement officer may take temporary custody of the firearm for the duration of that contact.” -13-3102 Section K, Arizona Law.</p>
<p>Under the law, there does not have to be any suspicion of wrongdoing. The seizing of the guns does not have to be in any way connected to a criminal investigation and the period of time that the police can confiscate guns is not specified under the law. This is the legalized public theft of private property and an egregious violation of the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>An Arizona court of appeals has upheld the law. According to CBS 5, in Arizona, one dissenting judge argued that Arizona police can only confiscate guns if there is investigative cause or suspicion of criminal activity. Even the dissenting opinion does not go far enough. Under the Constitution, Americans cannot be deprived of property without due process of law. This ruling effectively gives the police on the street the power of judge, jury and executioner. This is a clear separation of powers issues that the courts failed to address.</p>
<p>Beyond the immediacy of this outrageous ruling, lies the implications. Both the Canadian and the Arizona cases of gun confiscation speaks to a much larger and more sinister agenda.</p>
<p>Gun Confiscation is a Bad Omen for Any People</p>
<p>History clearly demonstrates that widespread gun confiscation, in any form, is an ominous sign for any country. The following is a brief synopsis of gun control.</p>
<p>1. In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves against their ethnic-cleansing government, were arrested and exterminated.</p>
<p>2. In 1929, the former Soviet Union established gun control as a means of controlling the “more difficult” of their citizens. From 1929 to the death of Stalin, 40 million Soviets met an untimely end at the hand of various governmental agencies as they were arrested and exterminated.</p>
<p>3. After the rise of the Nazi’s, Germany established their version of gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who were unable to defend themselves against the “Brown Shirts”, were arrested and exterminated. Interestingly, the Brown Shirts were eventually targeted for extermination themselves following their blind acts of allegiance to Hitler. Any American military and police would be wise to grasp the historical significance of the Brown Shirts’ fate.</p>
<p>4. After Communist China established gun control in 1935, an estimated 50 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves against their fascist leaders, were arrested and exterminated.</p>
<p>5. Closer to home, Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayans, unable to defend themselves against their ruthless dictatorship, were arrested and exterminated.</p>
<p>6. Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves from their dictatorial government, were arrested and exterminated.</p>
<p>7. Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million of the “educated” people, unable to defend themselves against their fascist government, were arrested and exterminated.</p>
<p>8. In 1994, Rwanda disarmed the Tutsi people and being unable to defend themselves from their totalitarian government, nearly one million were summarily executed.</p>
<p>The total numbers of victims who lost their lives because of gun control is approximately 70 million people in the 20th century. The historical voices from 70 million corpses speak loudly and clearly to those Americans who are advocating for a de facto gun ban. Governments murdered four times as many civilians as were killed in all the international and domestic wars combined. Governments murdered millions more people than were killed by common criminals and it all followed gun control.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>I would remind the reader that gun confiscation is not an end unto itself. It is a means to an end. For when the people are finally disarmed, the banking mafia that runs this country can have their way with this country with very little opposition. And if that ever happens, you will soon learn why the NSA is engaged in massive data base collections of your communications. This Sunday evening, on my talk show, I am interviewing someone who worked for DARPA at Arizona State University and he knows about the threat matrix scores which are being assigned to individuals and groups. This is real and yet, our people continue to remain in a slumber as the eye of the storm approaches.</p>
<p>At what point does or America, and for that matter, the people of the world decide that they have had enough of the banker inspired tyranny which has hijacked almost every nation on the planet through central banking?</p>
<p>Inch by inch the globalist bankers have been imposing their brand of tyranny. They are not at the gate, they are inside your home, inside your computer, inside your cell phone, inside your car and even inside your bedroom.</p>
<p>If there ever was going to be a tipping point, isn’t this it?</p>

				<p>June 2, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17695#respond" title="Comment on Perpetual War – And Obama’s Perpetual Con Game"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17695 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17695">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/obama-fly3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/obama-fly2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Barack Obama is a master trickster, a shape-shifter, and a methodical liar. The man who has arrogated to himself the right to kill at will, anywhere on the globe, accountable only to himself, based on secret information and classified legal rationales, now says he is determined that Washington’s “perpetual war” must one day end – sometime in the misty future after he is long gone from office. He <a href="http://http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/23/obama-drones-guantanamo-speech-text">informed</a> his global audience of potential victims that he had signed a secret agreement (with himself?) that would limit drone strikes to targets that pose “a continuing, imminent threat to Americans” and cannot be captured – a policy that his White House has always claimed (falsely) to be operative. He promises to be more merciful than before, “haunted” as he is by all the nameless deaths, although he admits to having done no wrong.</p>
<p>He is a man of boundless introspection, inviting us to ride with him on his wildly spinning moral compass. But, most of all, he is not George Bush – of that we can be certain, if only because he is younger and oratorically gifted and Black. “Beyond Afghanistan,” he said, “we must define our effort not as a boundless ‘global war on terror,’ but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.” Thus, magically, he redefined the U.S. war on terror out of existence (in perpetuity) by breaking the conflict down to its daily, constituent parts, while simultaneously affirming that America will soon travel “beyond Afghanistan” despite the fact that many thousands of Special Operations troops will continue their round the clock raids in the countryside while drones rain death from the skies for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Such conflicts, we must understand, are necessitated by the “imminence” of threats posed to U.S. security, as weighed and measured by secret means. His Eminence is the sole judge of imminence. He is also the arbiter of who is to be detained in perpetuity, without trial or (public) charge, for “association” with “terrorists” as defined by himself. He has no apologies for that.</p>
<p>America must turn the page on the previous era, because “the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11.” A reevaluation is in order, since “we have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11.” In that case, why not call for repeal of the layers of war on terror legislation that have accumulated over the last 12 years, including Obama&#8217;s own NDAA preventive detention bill? Or, he could simply renounce these measures and refuse to employ them as a matter of policy. Instead, the president defended his own maximalist interpretation of the law, and claimed that the legal basis for his kill-at-will authority is firmly rooted in the Congress’s 2001 Authorization of Military Force (AMUF). Although he made vague reference to changes that Congress might make in the AMUF, there was no substantive indication that he sought to impose restrictions on his own or any other president&#8217;s authority to wage war precisely as he has for the last four years.</p>
<p>Obama’s blanket interpretation of AMUF – the legal logic &#8211; had previously been considered a state secret. It was news to much of the U.S. Senate, too, until assistant secretary of defense Michael Sheehan, in charge of special operations (death squads) at the Pentagon, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/16/war-powers-obama-administration_n_3288420.html?view=print&amp;comm_ref=false">told lawmakers</a> earlier this month that the AMUF allows Obama to put “boots on the ground” anywhere he chooses, including “Yemen or the Congo,” if his classified logic compelled him to do so.</p>
<p>The senators were stunned – although it is no secret that Obama has already put U.S. Special Forces boots on the ground in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan, and has sent a combat brigade on permanent posting on the continent. Central Africa is one part of the world in which al Qaida has found little traction. The purported “bad guy” hiding in the bush, Joseph Kony, is the Christian leader of the remnants of the Lord’s Resistance Army. Obama authorized the deployment under the doctrine of Humanitarian Military Intervention, or Responsibility to Protect (R2P), a war-making notion that is, at best, ill-defined under international law and non-existent in U.S. statutes. However, if Obama is sincere (!) in wanting to phase out AMUF, as he averred last week, he’s always got R2P as a backup.</p>
<p>Death squad honcho Sheehan is a believer in the perpetual lifespan of AMUF, which he considers operative until al Qaida has been consigned to the “ash heap of history” – an eventuality that is “at least 10 to 20 years” away. Since this is the guy who carries out Obama’s kill orders (the identity of his counterpart in the CIA is, of course, a secret), one would think that Sheehan and Obama would be on the same page when it comes to al Qaida and AMUF. But then, we are told that page has turned.</p>
<p>Obama is very good at flipping pages, changing subjects, hiding the pea in his hand while we try to figure out which bowl it’s under. His call for Congress to come up with a substitute for AMUF – without yet offering his own version – is a ploy to more explicitly codify those powers assumed by Bush and expanded upon by the Obama administration. Or, the Congress can do nothing – a very likely outcome – and Obama can pretend to be the reluctant, self-restrained global assassin, preventive detainer and regime changer for the rest of his term.</p>
<p>Not a damn thing has changed.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fenchmirage3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fenchmirage2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>LONDON &#8211; One&#8217;s got to love the sound of a Frenchman&#8217;s Mirage 2000 fighter jet in the morning. Smells like&#8230; a delicious neo-colonial breakfast in Hollandaise sauce. Make it quagmire sauce.</p>
<p>Apparently, it&#8217;s a no-brainer. Mali holds 15.8 million people &#8211; with a per capita gross domestic product of only around US$1,000 a year and average life expectancy of only 51 years &#8211; in a territory twice the size of France (per capital GDP $35,000 and upwards). Now almost two-thirds of this territory is occupied by heavily weaponized Islamist outfits. What next? Bomb, baby, bomb.</p>
<p>So welcome to the latest African war; Chad-based French Mirages and Gazelle helicopters, plus a smatter of France-based</p>
<p>Rafales bombing evil Islamist jihadis in northern Mali. Business is good; French president Francois Hollande spent this past Tuesday in Abu Dhabi clinching the sale of up to 60 Rafales to that Gulf paragon of democracy, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
<p>The formerly wimpy Hollande &#8211; now enjoying his &#8220;resolute&#8221;, &#8220;determined&#8221;, tough guy image reconversion &#8211; has cleverly sold all this as incinerating Islamists in the savannah before they take a one-way Bamako-Paris flight to bomb the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>French Special Forces have been on the ground in Mali since early 2012.</p>
<p>The Tuareg-led NMLA (National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad), via one of its leaders, now says it&#8217;s &#8220;ready to help&#8221; the former colonial power, billing itself as more knowledgeable about the culture and the terrain than future intervening forces from the CEDEAO (the acronym in French for the Economic Community of Western African States).</p>
<p>Salafi-jihadis in Mali have got a huge problem: they chose the wrong battlefield. If this was Syria, they would have been showered by now with weapons, logistical bases, a London-based &#8220;observatory&#8221;, hours of YouTube videos and all-out diplomatic support by the usual suspects of US, Britain, Turkey, the Gulf petromonarchies and &#8211; oui, monsieur &#8211; France itself.</p>
<p>Instead, they were slammed by the UN Security Council &#8211; faster than a collection of Marvel heroes &#8211; duly authorizing a war against them. Their West African neighbors &#8211; part of the ECOWAS regional bloc &#8211; were given a deadline (late November) to come up with a war plan. This being Africa, nothing happened &#8211; and the Islamists kept advancing until a week ago Paris decided to apply some Hollandaise sauce.</p>
<p>Not even a football stadium filled with the best West African shamans can conjure a bunch of disparate &#8211; and impoverished &#8211; countries to organize an intervening army in short notice, even if the adventure will be fully paid by the West just like the Uganda-led army fighting al-Shabaab in Somalia.</p>
<p>To top it all, this is no cakewalk. The Salafi-jihadis are flush, courtesy of booming cocaine smuggling from South America to Europe via Mali, plus human trafficking. According to the UN Office of Drugs Control, 60% of Europe&#8217;s cocaine transits Mali. At Paris street prices, that is worth over $11 billion.</p>
<p><b>Turbulence ahead </b></p>
<p>General Carter Ham, the commander of the Pentagon&#8217;s AFRICOM, has been warning about a major crisis for months. Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy. But what&#8217;s really going on in what the New York Times quaintly describes as those &#8220;vast and turbulent stretches of the Sahara&#8221;?</p>
<p>It all started with a military coup in March 2012, only one month before Mali would hold a presidential election, ousting then president Amadou Toumani Toure. The coup plotters justified it as a response to the government&#8217;s incompetence in fighting the Tuareg.</p>
<p>The coup leader was one Captain Amadou Haya Sanogo, who happened to have been very cozy with the Pentagon; that included his four-month infantry officer basic training course in Fort Benning, Georgia, in 2010. Essentially, Sanogo was also groomed by AFRICOM, under a regional scheme mixing the State Department&#8217;s Trans Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership program and the Pentagon&#8217;s Operation Enduring Freedom. It goes without saying that in all this &#8220;freedom&#8221; business Mali has been the proverbial &#8220;steady ally&#8221; &#8211; as in counterterrorism partner &#8211; fighting (at least in thesis) al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).</p>
<p>Over the last few years, Washington&#8217;s game has elevated flip-flopping to high art. During the second George W Bush administration, Special Forces were very active side by side with the Tuaregs and the Algerians. During the first Obama administration, they started backing the Mali government against the Tuareg.</p>
<p>An unsuspecting public may pore over Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s papers &#8211; for instance, The Times of London &#8211; and its so-called defense correspondent will be pontificating at will on Mali without ever talking about blowback from the Libya war.</p>
<p>Muammar Gaddafi always supported the Tuaregs&#8217; independence drive; since the 1960s the NMLA agenda has been to liberate Azawad (North Mali) from the central government in Bamako.</p>
<p>After the March 2012 coup, the NMLA seemed to be on top. They planted their own flag on quite a few government buildings, and on April 5 announced the creation of a new, independent Tuareg country. The &#8220;international community&#8221; spurned them, only for a few months later to have the NMLA for all practical purposes marginalized, even in their own region, by three other &#8211; Islamist &#8211; groups; Ansar ed-Dine (&#8220;Defenders of the Faith&#8221;); the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO); and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).</p>
<p><b>Meet the players</b></p>
<p>The NMLA is a secular Tuareg movement, created in October 2011. It claims that the liberation of Azawad will allow better integration &#8211; and development &#8211; for all the peoples in the region. Its hardcore fighters are Tuaregs who were former members of Gaddafi&#8217;s army. But there are also rebels who had not laid down their arms after the 2007-2008 Tuareg rebellion, and some that defected from the Malian army. Those who came back to Mali after Gaddafi was executed by the NATO rebels in Libya carried plenty of weapons. Yet most heavy weapons actually ended up with the NATO rebels themselves, the Islamists supported by the West.</p>
<p>AQIM is the Northern African branch of al-Qaeda, pledging allegiance to &#8220;The Doctor&#8221;, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Its two crucial characters are Abu Zaid and Mokhtar Belmokhtar, former members of the ultra-hardcore Algerian Islamist outfit Salafist Group for Predication and Combat (SGPC). Belmokhtar was already a jihadi in 1980s Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Abu Zaid poses as a sort of North African &#8220;Geronimo&#8221;, aka Osama bin Laden, with the requisite black flag and a strategically positioned Kalashnikov featuring prominently in his videos. The historical leader, though, is Belmokhtar. The problem is that Belmokhtar, known by French intelligence as &#8220;The Uncatchable&#8221;, has recently joined MUJAO.</p>
<p>MUJAO fighters are all former AQIM. In June 2012, MUJAO expelled the NMLA and took over the city of Gao, when it immediately applied the worst aspects of Sharia law. It&#8217;s the MUJAO base that has been bombed by the French Rafales this week. One of its spokesmen has duly threatened, &#8220;in the name of Allah&#8221;, to respond by attacking &#8220;the heart of France&#8221;.</p>
<p>Finally, Ansar ed-Dine is an Islamist Tuareg outfit, set up last year and directed by Iyad ag Ghali, a former leader of the NMLA who exiled himself in Libya. He turned to Salafism because of &#8211; inevitably &#8211; Pakistani proselytizers let loose in Northern Africa, then engaged in valuable face time with plenty of AQIM emirs. It&#8217;s interesting to note in 2007 Mali President Toure appointed Ghali as consul in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia. He was then duly expelled in 2010 because he got too close to radical Islamists.</p>
<p><b>Gimme &#8216;a little more terrorism&#8217; </b></p>
<p>No one in the West is asking why the Pentagon-friendly Sanogo&#8217;s military coup in the capital ended up with almost two-thirds of Mali in the hands of Islamists who imposed hardcore Sharia law in Azawad &#8211; especially in Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal, a gruesome catalogue of summary executions, amputations, stonings and the destruction of holy shrines in Timbuktu. How come the latest Tuareg rebellion ended up hijacked by a few hundred hardcore Islamists? It&#8217;s useless to ask the question to US drones.</p>
<p>The official &#8220;leading from behind&#8221; Obama 2.0 administration rhetoric is, in a sense, futuristic; the French bombing &#8220;could rally jihadis&#8221; around the world and lead to &#8211; what else &#8211; attacks on the West. Once again the good ol&#8217; Global War on Terror (GWOT) remains the serpent biting its own tail.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way to understand Mali without examining what Algeria has been up to. The Algerian newspaper El Khabar only scratched the surface, noting that &#8220;from categorically refusing an intervention &#8211; saying to the people in the region it would be dangerous&#8221;, Algiers went to &#8220;open Algerian skies to the French Mirages&#8221;.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in Algeria last October, trying to organize some semblance of an intervening West African army. Hollande was there in December. Oh yes, this gets juicier by the month.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s turn to Professor Jeremy Keenan, from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at London University, and author of <i>The Dark Sahara</i> (Pluto Press, 2009) and the upcoming<i>The Dying Sahara</i> (Pluto Press, 2013).</p>
<p>Writing in the January edition of New African, Keenan stresses, &#8220;Libya was the catalyst of the Azawad rebellion, not its underlying cause. Rather, the catastrophe now being played out in Mali is the inevitable outcome of the way in which the &#8216;Global War on Terror&#8217; has been inserted into the Sahara-Sahel by the US, in concert with Algerian intelligence operatives, since 2002.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Bush and the regime in Algiers both needed, as Keenan points out, &#8220;a little more terrorism&#8221; in the region. Algiers wanted it as the means to get more high-tech weapons. And Bush &#8211; or the neo-cons behind him &#8211; wanted it to launch the Saharan front of the GWOT, as in the militarization of Africa as the top strategy to control more energy resources, especially oil, thus wining the competition against massive Chinese investment. This is the underlying logic that led to the creation of AFRICOM in 2008.</p>
<p>Algerian intelligence, Washington and the Europeans duly used AQIM, infiltrating its leadership to extract that &#8220;little more terrorism&#8221;. Meanwhile, Algerian intelligence effectively configured the Tuaregs as &#8220;terrorists&#8221;; the perfect pretext for Bush&#8217;s Trans-Saharan Counter-Terrorism Initiative, as well as the Pentagon&#8217;s Operation Flintlock &#8211; a trans-Sahara military exercise.</p>
<p>The Tuaregs always scared the hell out of Algerians, who could not even imagine the success of a Tuareg nationalist movement in northern Mali. After all, Algeria always viewed the whole region as its own backyard.</p>
<p>The Tuaregs &#8211; the indigenous population of the central Sahara and the Sahel &#8211; number up to 3 million. Over 800,000 live in Mali, followed by Niger, with smaller concentrations in Algeria, Burkina Faso and Libya. There have been no less than five Tuareg rebellions in Mali since independence in 1960, plus three others in Niger, and a lot of turbulence in Algeria.</p>
<p>Keenan&#8217;s analysis is absolutely correct in identifying what happened all along 2012 as the Algerians meticulously destroying the credibility and the political drive of the NMLA. Follow the money: both Ansar ed-Dine&#8217;s Iyad ag Ghaly and MUJAO&#8217;s Sultan Ould Badi are very cozy with the DRS, the Algerian intelligence agency. Both groups in the beginning had only a few members.</p>
<p>Then came a tsunami of AQIM fighters. That&#8217;s the only explanation for why the NMLA was, after only a few months, neutralized both politically and militarily in their own backyard.</p>
<p><b>Round up the usual freedom fighters</b></p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s &#8220;leading from behind&#8221; position is illustrated by this State Department <a href="http://usun.state.gov/briefing/statements/202714.htm">press conference</a>. Essentially, the government in Bamako asked for the French to get down and dirty.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Not really. Anyone who thinks &#8220;bomb al-Qaeda&#8221; is all there is to Mali must be living in Oz. To start with, using hardcore Islamists to suffocate an indigenous independence movement comes straight from the historic CIA/Pentagon playbook.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mali is crucial to AFRICOM and to the Pentagon&#8217;s overall MENA (Middle East-Northern Africa) outlook. Months before 9/11 I had the privilege to crisscross Mali on the road &#8211; and by the (Niger) river &#8211; and hang out, especially in Mopti and Timbuktu, with the awesome Tuaregs, who gave me a crash course in Northwest Africa. I saw Wahhabi and Pakistani preachers all over the place. I saw the Tuaregs progressively squeezed out. I saw an Afghanistan in the making. And it was not very hard to follow the money sipping tea in the Sahara. Mali borders Algeria, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Senegal, the Ivory Coast and Guinea. The spectacular Inner Niger delta is in central Mali &#8211; just south of the Sahara. Mali overflows with gold, uranium, bauxite, iron, manganese, tin and copper. And &#8211; Pipelineistan beckons! &#8211; there&#8217;s plenty of unexplored oil in northern Mali.</p>
<p>As early as February 2008, Vice Admiral Robert T Moeller was<a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200908140153.html">saying</a> that AFRICOM&#8217;s mission was to protect &#8220;the free flow of natural resources from Africa to the global market&#8221;; yes, he did make the crucial connection to China, pronounced guilty of &#8221; challenging US interests&#8221;.</p>
<p>AFRICOM&#8217;s spy planes have been &#8220;observing&#8221; Mali, Mauritania and the Sahara for months, in thesis looking for AQIM fighters; the whole thing is overseen by US Special Forces, part of the classified, code-named Creek Sand operation, based in next-door Burkina Faso. Forget about spotting any Americans; these are &#8211; what else &#8211; contractors who do not wear military uniforms.</p>
<p>Last month, at Brown University, General Carter Ham, AFRICOM&#8217;s commander, once more gave a big push to the &#8220;mission to advance US security interests across Africa&#8221;. Now it&#8217;s all about the &#8211; updated &#8211; US National Security Strategy in Africa, signed by Obama in June 2012. The (conveniently vague) objectives of this strategy are to &#8220;strengthen democratic institutions&#8221;; encourage &#8220;economic growth, trade and investment&#8221;; &#8220;advance peace and security&#8221;; and &#8220;promote opportunity and development.&#8221;</p>
<p>In practice, it&#8217;s Western militarization (with Washington &#8220;leading from behind&#8221;) versus the ongoing Chinese seduction/investment drive in Africa. In Mali, the ideal Washington scenario would be a Sudan remix; just like the recent partition of North and South Sudan, which created an extra logistical headache for Beijing, why not a partition of Mali to better exploit its natural wealth? By the way, Mali was known as Western Sudan until independence in 1960.</p>
<p>Already in early December a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-planning-for-multinational-military-operation-in-mali/2012/12/05/">&#8220;multinational&#8221; war</a> in Mali was on the Pentagon cards.</p>
<p>The beauty of it is that even with a Western-financed, Pentagon-supported, &#8220;multinational&#8221; proxy army about to get into the action, it&#8217;s the French who are pouring the lethal Hollandaise sauce (nothing like an ex-colony &#8220;in trouble&#8221; to whet the appetite of its former masters). The Pentagon can always keep using its discreet P-3 spy planes and Global Hawk drones based in Europe, and later on transport West African troops and give them aerial cover. But all secret, and very hush hush.</p>
<p>Mr Quagmire has already reared its ugly head in record time, even before the 1,400 (and counting) French boots on the ground went into offense.</p>
<p>A MUJAO commando team (and not AQIM, as it&#8217;s been reported), led by who else but the &#8220;uncatchable&#8221; Belmokhtar, hit a gas field in the middle of the Algerian Sahara desert, over 1,000 km south of Algiers but only 100 km from the Libyan border, where they captured a bunch of Western (and some Japanese) hostages; a rescue operation launched on Wednesday by Algerian Special Forces was, to put it mildly, a giant mess, with at least seven foreign hostages and 23 Algerians so far confirmed killed.</p>
<p>The gas field is being exploited by BP, Statoil and Sonatrach. MUJAO has denounced &#8211; what else &#8211; the new French &#8220;crusade&#8221; and the fact that French fighter jets now own Algerian airspace.</p>
<p>As blowback goes, this is just the hors d&#8217;oeuvres. And it won&#8217;t be confined to Mali. It will convulse Algeria and soon Niger, the source of over a third of the uranium in French nuclear power plants, and the whole Sahara-Sahel.</p>
<p>So this new, brewing mega-Afghanistan in Africa will be good for French neoloconial interests (even though Hollande insists this is all about &#8220;peace&#8221;); good for AFRICOM; a boost for those Jihadis Formerly Known as NATO Rebels; and certainly good for the never-ending Global War on Terror (GWOT), duly renamed &#8220;kinetic military operations&#8221;.</p>
<p>Django, unchained, would be totally at home. As for the Oscar for Best Song, it goes to the Bush-Obama continuum: There&#8217;s no business like terror business. With French subtitles, <i>bien sur</i>.</p>

			<p><strong>Sharia Law Is Not The Enemy&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/sharia-law-blue3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/sharia-law-blue2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Devvy Kidd is an intelligent, incisive, and talented writer who stays at the vanguard in the fight to preserve freedom.  Her articles are well researched and widely read.  She is a lead writer for the NewsWithViews internet page which is and has been a potent force against the cloud of oppression that threatens our nation.</p>
<p><span>Nevertheless, I take issue with </span><a href="http://newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd561.htm" target="_blank">her recent column</a><span> entitled “Plotting for America to Be Ruled Under Sharia Law is Sedition”.</span></p>
<p><span>The NewsWithViews website is theologically Dispensational.   The intention of its owner and its excellent cadre of writers is honorable.  But, like most of our media, there is a dangerous and detrimental side that concentrates on symptoms, omits essentials, and directs our attention away from real danger.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Islam and Sharia Law are being skillfully used to create conflict and fear.  Fear and strife weaken the ability of a society to resist the despotic intentions of the elite globalists.  Islam is a heretical religion but like all religions it demands exclusivity making it an enemy to the prevailing United States religion of humanism.  The percentage of Muslims in the United States population is tiny compared to professing Christians but because it is a full orbed religion with a legal system and a vibrant world view it is growing rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span>Like Christianity, Islam has different theological factions.  Most Muslims are not militant.  They seek to live under Sharia law because they understand that law forms the religious base of society.  If Sharia law can be demonized and forbidden, the entire religion of Islam will quickly follow.   They have seen this occur in United States of America where human law has been allowed to supersede the overarching law of God making us a nation of flaccid professing Christians who live under and support a government controlled by Satanic forces.</span></p>
<p><span>The world is engaged in a religious war.  Christianity has been almost defeated in the United States but Islam is still alive and promoting Sharia law rather than the sinful laws of the elite power structure.  Since religion is changed by changing the law, antinomian Christianity was unable to stem the advance of humanism.  It lost the battle without a fight.  Islam’s Sharia law is a strong impediment to the advance of the pagan world order and every effort is being made to destroy it.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Devvy has fallen for the propaganda that makes Sharia law an enemy and written an article that creates fear and loathing for a religion that is an ally in the fight against the elite globalist agenda.  Christianity and Islam are god centered religions.  Talmudic Judaism is a humanistic religion.  Like the United States, Zionist, neo-Israel has a pagan government that regularly defies God’s Commandments.</span></p>
<p><span>Devvy provides a link to Publius Huldah’s Blog.  Ms. Huldah contends that our rights come from God and it is “the purpose of civil government to secure the Rights GOD gave us.”  She lists a number of rights that are God given and before copiously excoriating Muslims asserts that “God means for us to enjoy life!  Healthy food, wine and strong drink (in moderation); attractive dress for women, the marriage relation between man &amp; woman, prosperity, and liberty!”</span></p>
<p><span>This is rubbish!  God is not our bartender, He does not furnish blessing at our demand.  We are His servants not He ours.  Peace, freedom, and prosperity are results of obedience to His Law.   The Bible is not a book about human rights; but a documentation of the results of obedience and disobedience.  It is a book about obligation; our obligation to obey the Creator of the Universe.  In response to our obedience God promises us blessings.  Obligation first; blessing second.</span></p>
<p><span>Our adversary is a cunning, elite, nihilistic, cabal that is using deception, torture, murder, theft, and mass destruction to gain control of the entire planet.  They have no allegiance to an overarching morality; where their power reins, their word is law.  Their behavior provides an excellent example of human nature in its unrestrained form.  It is not new but another in the thousands of replays that history records.</span></p>
<p><span>Attempts to resurrect the United States Constitution are passé.  In 2002, powerful congressman </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hyde" target="_blank">Henry Hyde</a><span> responded to Ron Paul with this statement:  &#8220;There are things in the </span><a title="U.S. Constitution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution" target="_blank">Constitution</a><span> that have been overtaken by events, by time. Declaration of war is one of them&#8230;. Inappropriate, anachronistic, it isn&#8217;t done anymore.&#8221;  Unfortunately, congress began the process and President Obama has finished it.  The civil liberties outlined in the Bill of Rights have been superseded by laws and Executive orders that expose most of our population to false arrest, torture, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_rendition" target="_blank">extraordinary rendition</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Heretical Dispensational theology is the platform for the NewsWithViews Website and their  Christian writers often produce an aberrant description of the Will of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. NWVs elevates Talmudic Judaism and the neo-Pharisees from enemies of the Faith that Jesus railed against to leaders that are revered and preserved.  It distorts the Christian religion willed to us by the Reformers and by denying the validity of the law destroys the ability of Christianity to impact the social order.</span></p>
<p><span>The Talmud is an historic compilation of the thoughts of Rabbi’s; it is humanistic and often conniving.  Zionist Jews place the Talmud in a position similar to that of Mary in the Catholic religion but instead of being the Mother of God the Talmud is the father of the devil.  It puts the opinions of the Rabbis above the Word of God.  It affirms the superiority of the Jewish race.  It condones sinful behavior, allows God’s Law to be broken, and builds the ego of those who revere it.  In “Judaism’s Strange God’s” Michael Hoffman writes “The Talmud is such a heap of rubbish, and Judaism is so harmful to Judaic people, that it is difficult to find any good whatsoever in it.”  He goes on to describe the reverent regard given to Talmudic scholars by the Orthodox Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2012/11/26/the-osama-bin-laden-myth-2/" target="_blank">Paul Craig Robert’s recent column</a><span> contained a 2001 Pakistani interview with Osama bin Laden Bin Laden denied having anything to do with the 9/11 attack. He said, “I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children, and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children, and other people.”  This was a Pakistani interview.  Bin Laden was speaking to fellow Muslims.   We can decide not to believe him but we know our media lies to us and there is a good chance Osama is truthful.  His profession of honesty is far and away better than the rampant prevarication in our society!</span></p>
<p><span>The source material for Devvy’s article could have come directly from the propaganda machine of Judaism’s Zionist faction.  The same humanistic Zionists that have debased our morals with filthy movies, destroyed our culture with multi-culturalism, banished Christianity with the ACLU, attacked patriots with the Southern Poverty Law Center, fed us distorted and propagandized news through ownership of television stations, radio stations, newspapers, and book publishers;  the same group that surrounds and controls our government leaders and was the source for the warmongering Project for the New America Century (PNAC).  These are rabid humanists who seek to use our nation to invade Iran and stamp out the Muslim religion. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>It is not a Godly group, not a group that might accept Jesus as the propitiation for their sin.  Not a group that God would bless.  These are Christ haters; men and women who would crucify Jesus again today.  Their prayers cannot be heard by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  His ears are only attuned to the Name of His Son.  He does not hear prayers in the name of another.</span></p>
<p><span>No, my Christian friend, Sharia law is not the enemy.  Islam is an ally against humanistic world government.  Talmudic Jews are prominent in the elite cabal that seeks control of the world. Dispensational support for humanistic Judaism is Satanic.</span></p>
<p><span>There are few, if any, Christian heads-of-state in today’s world.  I was surprised to read of one such leader and of his eloquent prayer of repentance. </span><a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/636533-for-the-sins-of-uganda-i-repent-museveni.html" target="_blank"> This is the prayer</a><span> of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on the fiftieth anniversary of their independence from British rule:</span></p>
<p><span>“Father God in heaven, today we stand here as Ugandans, to thank you for Uganda. We are proud that we are Ugandans and Africans. We thank you for all your goodness to us.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I stand here today to close the evil past and especially in the last 50 years of our national leadership history and at the threshold of a new dispensation in the life of this nation. I stand here on my own behalf and on behalf of my predecessors to repent. We ask for your forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p>“We confess these sins, which have greatly hampered our national cohesion and delayed our political, social and economic transformation.”</p>
<p><span>“We confess sins of idolatry and witchcraft which are rampant in our land. We confess sins of shedding innocent blood, sins of political hypocrisy, dishonesty, intrigue and betrayal.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Forgive us of sins of pride, tribalism and sectarianism; sins of laziness, indifference and irresponsibility; sins of corruption and bribery that have eroded our national resources; sins of sexual immorality, drunkenness and debauchery; sins of unforgiveness, bitterness, hatred and revenge; sins of injustice, oppression and exploitation; sins of rebellion, insubordination, strife and conflict.”</span></p>
<p><span>“These sins and many others have characterised our past leadership, especially the last 50 years of our history. Lord forgive us and give us a new beginning. Give us a heart to love you, to fear you and to seek you. Take away from us all the above sins.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We pray for national unity. Unite us as Ugandans and eliminate all forms of conflict, sectarianism and tribalism. Help us to see that we are all your children, children of the same Father. Help us to love and respect one another and to appreciate unity in diversity.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We pray for prosperity and transformation. Deliver us from ignorance, poverty and disease. As leaders, give us wisdom to help lead our people into political, social and economic transformation.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We want to dedicate this nation to you so that you will be our God and guide. We want Uganda to be known as a nation that fears God and as a nation whose foundations are firmly rooted in righteousness and justice to fulfill what the Bible says in Psalm 33:12: Blessed is the nation, whose God is the Lord. A people you have chosen as your own.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I renounce all the evil foundations and covenants that were laid in idolatry and witchcraft. I renounce all the satanic influence on this nation. And I hereby covenant Uganda to you, to walk in your ways and experience all your blessings forever.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I pray for all these in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span>Are you listening America?</span></p>

				<p>November 26, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=16312#respond" title="Comment on Why Is Obama Silent Over The New Congo War?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="16312 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=16312">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/congowar3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/congowar2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>The last Congo war that ended in 2003 killed 5.4 million people, the worst humanitarian disaster since World War II. The killing was directly enabled by international silence over the issue; the war was ignored and the causes obscured because governments were backing groups involved in the fighting.  Now a new Congo war has begun and the silence is, again, deafening.</p>
<p>President Obama seems not to have noticed a new war has broken out in the war-scarred Congo; he  appears blind to the refugee crisis and the war crimes committed by the invading M23 militia against the democratically elected government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</p>
<p>But appearances can be deceiving. The U.S. government has their bloody hands all over this conflict, just as they did during the last Congo war when Bill Clinton was President. President Obama&#8217;s inaction is a conscious act of encouragement for the invaders, just as Clinton&#8217;s was. Instead of Obama denouncing the invasion and the approaching overthrow of a democratically elected government, silence becomes a very powerful action of intentional complicity on the side of the invaders.</p>
<p>Why would Obama do this? The invaders are armed and financed by Rwanda, a &#8220;strong ally&#8221; and puppet of the United States. The United Nations released a report conclusively proving that the Rwandan government is backing the rebels, but the U.S. government and U.S. media cartoonishly pretend that the issue is debatable.</p>
<p>The last Congo War that killed 5.4 million people was also the result of the U.S.-backed invading armies of Rwanda and Uganda, as explained in the excellently researched book “Africa&#8217;s World War,” by French journalist Gerard Prunier.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the same Rwandan war criminals involved in the last Congo War, such as Bosco Ntaganda, are in charge of the M23 militia and wanted for war crimes by the U.N. international criminal court. The current Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, is a &#8220;good friend&#8221; of the U.S. government and one of the most notorious war criminals on the planet, due to his leading roles in the Rwandan genocide and consequent Congo War.</p>
<p>A group of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>Congolese and Rwandan activists have been demanding that Kagame be tried for his key role in the Rwandan genocide.</p>
<p>As Prunier&#8217;s book explains, the Rwandan genocide was sparked by Kagame&#8217;s invasion of Rwanda — from U.S. ally Uganda. After Kagame took power in post-genocide Rwanda, he then informed the U.S. — during a trip to Washington D.C. — that he would be invading the Congo. Prunier quotes Kagame in Africa&#8217;s World War:</p>
<p>&#8220;I delivered a veiled warning [to the U.S.]: the failure of the international community to take action [against the Congo] would mean that Rwanda would take action&#8230; But their [the Clinton Administration’s] response was really no response at all&#8221;  (pg 68).</p>
<p>In international diplomacy speak, such a lack of response — to a threat of military invasion — acts as a glaring diplomatic green light.</p>
<p>The same blinding green light is now being offered by Obama to the exact same war criminals as they again invade the Congo.</p>
<p>But why again? The Democratic Republic of the Congo&#8217;s current President, Joseph Kabila, helped lead the military invasion during the last Congo war. As a good stooge, he delivered Congo&#8217;s immense mining and oil wealth to multi-national corporations. But then his puppet strings started to fray.</p>
<p>Kabila later distanced himself from U.S. puppets Rwanda and Uganda, not to mention the U.S. dominated International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The IMF, for example, warned Kabila against a strategic infrastructural and development aid package with China, but Kabila shrugged them off. The <em>Economist</em> explains:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;[The Congo] appears to have gained the upper hand in a row with foreign donors over a mining and infrastructure package worth $9 billion that was agreed a year ago with China. The IMF objected to it, on the ground that it would saddle Congo with a massive new debt, so [the IMF] is delaying forgiveness of most of the $10 billion-plus that Congo already owes.&#8221;</p>
<p>This act instantly transformed Kabila from an unreliable friend to an enemy. The U.S. and China have been madly scrambling for Africa&#8217;s immense wealth of raw materials, and Kabila&#8217;s new alliance with China was too much for the U.S. to bear.</p>
<p>Kabila further inflamed his former allies by demanding that the international corporations exploiting the Congo&#8217;s precious metals have their super-profit contracts re-negotiated, so that the country might actually receive some benefit from its riches.</p>
<p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo is home to 80 percent of the world&#8217;s cobalt, an extremely precious mineral needed to construct many modern technologies, including weaponry, cell phones, and computers. The DRC is possibly the most mineral/resource rich country in the world — overflowing with everything from diamonds to oil — though its people are among the world&#8217;s poorest, due to generations of corporate plunder of its wealth.</p>
<p>Now, a new war is underway and the U.N. is literally sitting on their hands. There are 17,500 U.N. peacekeepers in the DRC, not to mention U.S. Special Forces. The invading M23 militia has 3,000 fighters. What was the U.N.&#8217;s response to the invasion? The <em>New York Times</em> reports:</p>
<p>&#8220;United Nations officials have said that they did not have the numbers to beat back the rebels and that they were worried about collateral damage, but many Congolese have rendered their own verdict. On Wednesday, rioters in Bunia, north of Goma, ransacked the houses of United Nations’ personnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Obama and/or the U.N. made one public statement about militarily defending the elected Congolese government against invasion, the M23 militia would have never acted.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch and other groups have correctly labeled the M23’s commanders as responsible for “ethnic massacres, recruitment of children, mass rape, killings, abductions and torture.”</p>
<p>But at the U.N. the Obama administration has been actively protecting this group. The New York Times continues:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some human rights groups say that Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations and a leading contender to be President Obama’s next secretary of state, has been far too soft on Rwanda, which is a close American ally and whose president, Paul Kagame, has known Ms. Rice for years. The activists have accused her of watering down language in a Security Council resolution that would have mentioned Rwanda’s links to the [M23] rebels and say she also tried to block the publication of part of a [U.N.] report that detailed Rwanda’s covert support for the M23.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely that the Obama administration will jump into action as soon as his M23 allies complete their military objective of regime change, and re-open the Congo&#8217;s mineral wealth to U.S. corporations to profit from. There are currently talks occurring in U.S.-puppet Uganda between the M23 and the Congo government. It is unlikely that these talks will produce much of a result unless Kabila stands down and allows the M23 and its Rwandan backers to take over the country. The M23 knows it&#8217;s in an excellent bargaining position, given the silence of the U.N. and the United States government.</p>
<p>If the war drags on, expect more international silence. Expect more massacres and ethnic cleansing too, and expect the still-recovering people of the Congo to be re-tossed into massive refugee camps where they can again expect militia-sponsored killings, rape, starvation, and the various barbarisms that have accompanied this especially brutal war, a brutality that grows most viciously in environments of silence.</p>

Modalistic moguls of the painfully-obvious-money-hungry prosperity movement, like T.D. Jakes, are not as dangerous as Rick Warren. Self-serving sorcerers of the false signs and wonders movement, like Todd Bentley, are not as dangerous as Rick Warren. No. None of the before-mentioned personalities or groups are all that dangerous because what you see is what you get. They all lack the ability to change their appearance to accommodate a change in environment. They lack the chameleon-like ability, the self-serving ability, to say what needs to be said in order to keep people in every camp liking them.</em>—Tony Miano</p>
<p>In <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14216">part 1</a> I brought you up to speed on what some “watchbloggers” refer to as “Kingsway-gate.”  I’m guessing we haven’t heard the end of this mess.  However, this matter and many others commented on in part 1 have helped to earn Rick Warren the title: Teflon Pastor.  So we shall see what happens with Kingsway-gate.</p>
<p><strong>Common ground in the love of God…or god?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely Saddleback Church congregants are unaware that their pastor signed a controversial document produced by the Yale Center for Faith and Culture titled <a href="http://www.yale.edu/faith/acw/acw.htm" target="_blank">Loving God and Neighbor Together: A Christian Response to a Common Word Between Us and You.</a>  In July 2008 Christian and Muslim leaders gathered at Yale University for a conference to promote understanding and peace between Christians and Muslims. The letter urged the two faiths to find “common ground” in the love of God.   Since Christians and Muslims do not believe in the same God, one wonders which God we’re to find common ground with.</p>
<p>The Christian Post <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/christians-muslims-seek-common-ground-at-historic-conference-33511/" target="_blank">reported</a> that Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, “disagreed with key points raised in the letter because he felt they compromised the Christian faith [and] amid calls for love in a common God, the letter ‘failed to clearly define the Christian understanding of God as the trinity.’&#8221;</p>
<p>So why would any serious Christian sign a document that did not clearly define the Trinity?</p>
<p>Rick Warren claims he believes in the Trinity and we must take him at his word on this.  But to what extent does his belief in the Trinity come through in his ministry to Muslims?  Does he keep his Trinitarian belief close to the vest so as not to offend them?  Or is he forthcoming in his belief that there is one true God who exists in three co-equal, co-eternal, and co-existent Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?  If his Muslim friends cannot understand his view of the Godhead, perhaps he’s not bothering to explain it to them.</p>
<p>The Christian Post report revealed some of the notable leaders at the conference:</p>
<p><em>Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan; former Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi of Sudan; Geoff Tunnicliffe, CEO and international director of World Evangelical Alliance; Leith Anderson, president of NAE; and Antonios Kireopoulos of the National Council of Churches. A handful of Jewish leaders will also attend the conference.</em></p>
<p>Scroll through the list of signatories and you’ll discover several other notable leaders (theological liberals) such as Emerging church proponents Brian McLaren, Tony Jones and Scot McKnight; prosperity evangelist David Yonggi Cho; one of the “seeker-sensitive” architects, Bill Hybles; Richard Mouw, President, Fuller Theological Seminary; David Neff, Editor in Chief, Christianity Today; gospel of self-esteem sageRobert Schuller; Marxist sympathizer Jim Wallis (mentioned in <a href="http://worldviewweekend.com/worldview-times/article.php?articleid=8091" target="_blank">part 1</a>); and of course Rick Warren.</p>
<p>Certainly biblical unity can be a good thing, but as Phil Johnson reminds us:</p>
<p><em>The concept of “unity”  commonly touted today has nothing whatsoever to do with ‘being in full accord and of one mind’ (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Philippians%202.2" target="_blank">Philippians 2:2</a>). Instead, it is a broad, visible, ecumenical homogeneity without boundaries.  And that is nothing like the biblical concept of unity.</em></p>
<p>What did Jesus say regarding unity?  “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword” (Matt. 10:34).</p>
<p><strong>Global peace, at last</strong></p>
<p>April 17, 2005 speaking before 30,000 at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Rick Warren breathlessly proclaimed his plan:</p>
<p><em>The bottom line is that we intend to reinvent mission strategy in the 21st century.  As I stated, this will be a new Reformation.  The First Reformation returned us to the message of the original church.  It was a reformation of doctrine – what the church BELIEVES.  This Second Reformation will return us to the mission of the original church.  It will be a reformation of PURPOSE – what the church DOES in the world.</em></p>
<p><em>Our goal will be to enlist one billion foot soldiers for the Kingdom of God, who will permanently change the face of international missions to take on these five ‘global giants’ for which the church can become the ultimate distribution and change agent to overcome Spiritual emptiness, Self-serving Leadership, Poverty, disease and ignorance . (<a href="http://www.letusreason.org/Popteac26.htm" target="_blank">Online source</a>)</em></p>
<p>Warren put forth his program for global Christian dominion.  He also encouraged the crowd, the majority of them Christians, to adopt the same sort of dedication shown by followers of Hitler, Lenin, and Mao.</p>
<p><strong>The New Apostolic Purpose Driven Reformation</strong></p>
<p>As Rick Warren reveals the details of his global agenda, more and more Christians are expressing concern over it.  And so are liberals.  In fact liberals are so uneasy over what he and other dominionists are doing that the New Apostolic Research Group was formed.  Far-left blogger Bruce Wilson is part of it.  In a 2009 column Wilson declared:</p>
<p><em>Both C. Peter Wagner and Rick Warren want to transform the world, and both [<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020502467.html" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2009/5/28/19033/8502" target="_blank">2</a>] have proclaimed the advent of a second Reformation. Wagner calls it the New Apostolic Reformation, while for Rick Warren this is a &#8220;purpose driven&#8221; effort powered by Warren&#8217;s global <a href="http://www.thepeaceplan.com/" target="_blank">P.E.A.C.E. Plan</a>. In Uganda both visions for societal transformation appear to include the categorical elimination of homosexuality &#8211; by any means.</em></p>
<p>By any means?  Hyperbole, I presume. As a committed lefty, Bruce Wilson fully supports the radical homosexual agenda to normalize sodomy and other aberrant behavior.</p>
<p>Wilson continues:</p>
<p><em>Rick Warren wrote his 1993 dissertation for a Doctorate of Ministry from Fuller Theological Seminar, under Wagner&#8217;s supervision. It is titled New Churches For a New Generation: Church Planting to Reach Baby Boomers. In his 2008 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dominion-Kingdom-Action-Change-World/dp/0800794354" target="_blank">&#8220;Dominion&#8221;</a>, C. Peter Wagner describes the process through which this brand of Christianity can take dominion over government and society, and Wagner claims that this can be done within a democratic framework. Wagner clearly states that Rick Warren&#8217;s global P.E.A.C.E. Plan is an example of &#8220;stage one&#8221;: </em></p>
<p><em>Wagner is the Convening Apostle in a movement of charismatic &#8220;relational networks&#8221; which has extended its reach from the United States to Uganda, and worldwide. Under its <a href="http://www.apostlesnet.net/" target="_blank">umbrella of authority</a> are virulently anti-gay apostles in the United States and Uganda including Lou Engle of <a href="http://www.thecall.com/" target="_blank">TheCall</a>, who led thousands of young people in a twelve hour November 1, 2008 stadium rally in support of California&#8217;s anti-gay marriage Proposition Eight. The San Diego event closed with Engle, a member of Wagner&#8217;s inner circle of &#8220;prophets,&#8221; <a href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2008/11/4/14143/7617" target="_blank">calling for</a> Christian martyrs. Wagner&#8217;s plans include reorganizing charismatic Christianity under the authority of these apostles and prophets. (links in original) (<a href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2009/12/4/134435/084/" target="_blank">Online source</a>)  </em></p>
<p>Wilson has done his homework on the NAR.  Unbelievably, most Christians have not taken this movement seriously even though these false teachers have united with the Christian Right, politicians, rock-star pastors, entertainers, radio personalities, and a host of Christian leaders.  Likewise, New Age Mormon Glenn Beck has weaseled his way into these groups.  (Learn more about the NAR <a href="http://emailbrigade.com/306.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Growing a church</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.churchplantingtoday.com/" target="_blank">Break Through These 3 Barriers to Growth</a> “Coach&#8221; Warren outlines three essentials for breaking through the barriers to church growth. Following is barrier #2:</p>
<p><strong><em>You must change the primary role of the pastor from minister to leader.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>What’s the difference? In leadership, you take the initiative; in ministry, you respond to the needs of others. When someone calls and you pick up the phone, that’s ministry. When you pick up the phone and call someone, that’s leadership. Typically, you learn ministry skills in seminary, but you learn leadership skills in seminars. Pastoring is a balance. Here are five skills you must learn if your church is going to grow:</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn to communicate your vision.</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn the ability to motivate through messages.</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn how to equip for ministry. If you don’t learn how to coach, you will not be able to equip. And, if you do not equip, you will burn out in ministry.</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn how to raise money. Those who write the agenda must also be able to underwrite it.</em></p>
<p><em>…Learn the skill of managing your time and energy.</em></p>
<p>What about Rick Warren’s view of growing a church?  In <a href="http://www.sovereigngraceministries.org/blogs/cj-mahaney/post/2011/05/19/Ordinary-Pastors-part-2-A-Biblical-Definition-of-Ministry.aspx" target="_blank">Ordinary Pastors, part 2: A Biblical Definition of Ministry</a> C. J. Mahaney defines pastoral ministry thusly:</p>
<p><em>Pastoral ministry that is pleasing to God is not ultimately about gifting, influence, or even fruitfulness. It is not about how many books you have written, which conferences invite you to speak, or how many of your sermons are downloaded on iTunes. It is not even about whether your church membership numbers grow or shrink. Pastoral ministry that is pleasing to God is about faithfulness to the charge of 2 Timothy 4. You and I are called to be faithful to this charge.</em></p>
<p>For the record, here’s what Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:1-5:</p>
<p><em>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</em></p>
<p><strong>Peace + unity = universalism</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=14216&amp;action=edit">part 1</a>, I pointed out that Rick Warren serves on the advisory board of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation and that the foundation’s goal is to unify the world’s major religions.  Following is Warren’s explanation for serving:</p>
<p><em>The vision and values of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation are desperately needed today&#8230;. In any effort to help people learn to live and work together, we must engage the vast networks, resources, wisdom, and influence of the faith communities. My friends, [Roman Catholic] Tony Blair is uniquely prepared with the gifts of temperament, knowledge, experience, leadership, and global respect essential for a task this great. I honestly don’t know of anyone better suited for this challenge. It’s why I agreed to serve on the Advisory Board. The Tony Blair Faith Foundation’s potential for doing good is staggering.</em></p>
<p>What is staggering is that a Protestant pastor has no problem with a Catholic’s plan to unite all religious faiths.  In a piece I wrote titled <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/100525" target="_blank">Damnable heresies invading the church</a> I touched on the push for unity:</p>
<p><em>What Warren is purporting is ecumenicism. Actually, we are moving beyond ecumenicism into<a href="http://www.lighthousetrailsresearch.com/interspirituality.htm" target="_blank">interspirituality</a> (interfaith spirituality) or interdenominational cooperation.  “In the name of peace and unity,” says Ray Yungen, “the world’s religions are more and more joining together. And with that joining together will come a consensus that it is narrow minded and even hateful to say there is only one way to salvation.”</em></p>
<p><em>Peace and unity has a nice ring to it. But traditional, historic, evangelical Christianity holds that there is only one path to God, one door to enter through. Peter left no doubt when he said, “Salvation is found in no one else” (Acts 4:10). (Also see John 3:16, John 6:66-68, John 14:6, Acts 16:30-31, 1 Tim 2:3-6, 1 John 2:1)  The Bible clearly teaches that all paths do not lead to God.  Those who take a different path will spend eternity in hell.  So the loving thing for a committed Christian to do is to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the lost.  In fact, Jesus commanded His followers to go out into the world and spread the good news.   Those who keep the good news to themselves fail to understand that God gives no second chances.  Jesus said, “Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity” (Mat. 7:22).</em></p>
<p>My reason for this article (part 1&amp;2) is to highlight some very concerning issues related to Rick Warren.  Each of the concerns that were identified could have been substantially expanded upon and if that is the readers’ desire there are links and references that will help one to do that.  My purpose has been to urge his followers and supporters to be like the Bereans who “were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so” (Acts 17:11).</p>
<p>In these dark days ahead, God’s people must be watchful and discerning. We must “Prove [test] all things; hold fast that which is good” (1Thes 5:21).</p>

<p>But human babies are different from animal babies.  It is against the law to keep human babies caged up in a zoo.</p>
<p>Even homeless poverty-stricken American pregnant women who have been sent to jail for whatever &#8212; after giving birth behind bars, even their children aren&#8217;t forced to remain in captivity and caged up like their moms.  Americans are much more humane than that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chaaban.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/palestinian_children_killed_by_israeli_fire_in_gaza.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.chaaban.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/palestinian_children_killed_by_israeli_fire_in_gaza.jpg" align="left" width="220" /></a>Even the poor Sudanese refugee Lost Boys weren&#8217;t allowed to be caged.  Thousands of them were given good educational opportunities and offered good homes in the United States.</p>
<p>Even the approximately seven million Afghan and Iraqi orphans created by Bush, Cheney and Obama are still being allowed a modicum of freedom once in a while <a href="http://www.afceco.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.afceco.org/</a>.</p>
<p>But Palestinian children?  No such luck.  They are born in captivity, they grow up in captivity and they die in captivity &#8212; just because someone else wants their land.</p>
<p>But even sadder still is the fact that most zoo animals are treated more humanely than Palestinian children.  Palestinian children&#8217;s keepers think nothing of shooting, bombing, starving and siccing dogs on these captive kids, housed in open-air prisons such as Gaza and Ni&#8217;lin.  Captive baby lions and pandas never have to endure anything even remotely as horrible as this.</p>

				<p>March 14, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14121#comments" title="Comment on DARPA Director Leaves Pentagon, Moves to Google"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="14121 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14121">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Darpa director Regina Dugan will soon be stepping down from her position atop the Pentagon’s premiere research shop to take a job with Google. Dugan, whose controversial tenure at the agency lasted just under three years, was “offered and accepted at senior executive position” with the internet giant, according to Darpa spokesman Eric Mazzacone. She felt she couldn’t say no to such an “innovative company,” he adds.</p>

<p>Dugan’s emphasis on cybersecurity and next-generation manufacturing earned her strong support from the White House, winning her praise from the President and maintaining the agency’s budget even during a period of relative austerity at the Pentagon. Her push into crowdsourcing and outreach to the hacker community were eye-openers in the often-closed world of military R&amp;D. Dugan also won over some military commanders by diverting some of her research cash from long-term, blue-sky projects to immediate battlefield concerns.</p>
<p>“There is a time and a place for daydreaming. But it is not at Darpa,” she told a congressional panel in March 2011 (.pdf). “Darpa is not the place of dreamlike musings or fantasies, not a place for self-indulging in wishes and hopes. Darpa is a place of doing.” For an agency that spent millions of dollars on shape-shifting robots, Mach 20 missiles, and mind-controlled limbs, it was something of a revolutionary statement.</p>

</div>
<p>The shift was only one of the reasons why Dugan was a highly polarizing figure within her agency, and in the larger defense research community. The Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) is also actively investigating hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of contracts that Darpa gave out to RedX Defense — a bomb-detection firm that Dugan co-founded, and still partially owns. A separate audit is examining a sample of the 2,000 other research contracts Darpa has signed during Dugan’s tenure, to “determine the adequacy of Darpa’s selection, award, and administration of contracts and grants,” according to a military memorandum.</p>
<p>Results of the inspector general’s work haven’t been released. And the work had “no impact” on Dugan’s decision, according to her spokesman, Mazzacone. “The only reason” she decided to leave the Pentagon was the allure of working at Google.</p>
<p>“Dr. Dugan’s departure is not related to an OIG investigation,” Lt. Col. Melinda Morgan, a spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, adds in a statement. “The OIG conducts regular audits of Defense agency contracts and ethics programs; as a Defense agency, this includes Darpa.”</p>
<p>“In the spring, questions were raised over whether it was appropriate for Darpa to have funded a proposal submitted by RedXDefense, particularly in light of the Director’s continuing interest in this closely held small business,” Morgan says. “In response, the Department reviewed the processes in place at Darpa to ensure that those processes would ensure integrity and public confidence.” That review — separate from the OIG’s ongoing audits — found that Darpa and its chief’s actions “were consistent with the letter and spirit of relevant laws, regulations, and policies governing conflict of interest.”</p>
<p>Dugan is expected to depart “sometime in the next few weeks,” Mazzacone notes in an email. Darpa deputy director Kaigham “Ken” Gabriel, who has overseen the agency’s day-to-day operations since mid-2009, will serve as the acting Darpa chief. He’ll certainly be a strong contender for the permanent position, as will Lisa Porter, the head of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity — Darpa’s counterpart in the intelligence community.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Pentagon’s leadership are hailing the first female director of its most important research agency. “Regina Dugan’s leadership at Darpa has been extraordinary and she will be missed throughout the Department,” Frank Kendall, Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, says in a statement. “We are all very grateful for the many contributions she has made in advancing the technologies that our war fighters depend on. She leaves for an exciting new opportunity and we wish her every success.”</p>

				<p>March 13, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14113#respond" title="Comment on Is Kony 2012 The Right Thing To Do?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="14113 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14113">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/KONY2012-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/KONY2012-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>By now, most people who pay attention to the news are likely aware of the Kony 2012 film and campaign. Launched by the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.invisiblechildren.com/" target="_blank">Invisible Children (IC)</a>, the campaign shines a light on Joseph Kony, a leader of the brutal Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA) rebel group that has terrorized Uganda since 1986. The LRA kidnapped children from their homes, and turned the girls into sex slaves and the boys into child soldiers. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kony" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, &#8220;[a]n estimated 66,000 children became soldiers and two million people have been internally displaced since 1986&#8243; under Kony&#8217;s brutal reign in Uganda.</p>
<p>In 2005, the International Criminal Court in The Hague <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/D207D618-D99D-49B6-A1FC-A1A221B43007/283906/ICC2011AnnualReporttoUNEnglish1.pdf" target="_blank">issued an arrest warrant for Kony</a> for war crimes, but he has yet to be captured. Kony is believed to currently reside in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, or Southern Sudan.</p>
<p>Through the Kony 2012 campaign, IC hopes to raise Kony&#8217;s profile worldwide in hopes of finding him and bringing him to justice. And opinions on this tactic are diverse.</p>
<p>Some are criticizing the campaign as being another case of the white man trying to save black people. (The filmmaker and narrator is a white man, with his prominently featured little blond-haired boy.) IC <a href="http://www.invisiblechildren.com/critiques.html" target="_blank">addresses this</a> by pointing out that 95% of IC&#8217;s leadership and staff on the ground are Ugandans, not white people from America.</p>
<p>Raising other issues is Victor Ochen, director for the African Youth Initiative Network (AYINET) &#8211; Uganda, and himself a survivor of the LRA&#8217;s war in Uganda. In a <a href="http://www.africanyouthinitiative.org/war-victims-opinion-on-invisible-childrens-kony-2012/" target="_blank">recent article</a>, Ochen suggests that the problem is not as straightforward as IC&#8217;s film might imply. He says that &#8220;much more needs to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular,&#8221; says Ochen, &#8220;there is a need for much greater protection of civilians in South Sudan and the DRC and Central African Republic where the LRA is now active. Furthermore, many of the devastating effects of the war between the LRA and the Government of Uganda have still not been addressed in northern Uganda, even though the LRA has not been active here since 2006. These include the most serious physical and mental health effects, the weakening of key social and protective services, the nearly complete absence of remedy for harms suffered, and an utter lack of accountability.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Second,&#8221; Ochen continues, &#8220;as someone whose brother and cousin were abducted and who are among the thousands of disappeared whose fate is unknown, I join with other Ugandans who hope our relatives are still in captivity and will come back home alive. Any advocacy aimed at military bombardment of the LRA rebels remains therefore very sensitive throughout northern Uganda, and I imagine the DRC and South Sudan and Central African Republic as well, because thousands of children and adults have been abducted and have still not come home yet. My own father is deeply traumatized due to my brother and cousin&#8217;s abduction, and every time he hears about any report of killing LRA rebels he is not sure whom they have killed and wonders if people are celebrating his beloved son&#8217;s death. These are the feelings many families have. I agree that Kony must be stopped as soon as possible. However, it must be done in a way that avoids further civilian casualties and the loss of the lives of innocent children. Raising potentially false expectation such as arresting Kony in 2012 will not rebuild the lives of the people in northern Uganda. Rebuilding communities and rehabilitating victims is what we need. The stronger survivors become, the less Kony remains an issue. Restoration of communities devastated by Kony is a greater priority than catching or even killing him.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/105689" target="_blank">makes the point</a> that &#8220;[a]rresting Kony and other LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice, and it would end the scourge of one of Africa&#8217;s most brutal groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amnesty International has addressed one of Ochen&#8217;s concerns by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/efforts-arrest-joseph-kony-must-respect-human-rights-2012-03-08?utm_source=CICC+Newsletters&amp;utm_campaign=5abd45ad84-Uganda_3_12_2012&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank">stating</a> that any efforts to arrest Kony must respect human rights. &#8220;Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights,&#8221; said Erwin van der Borght, Amnesty&#8217;s Africa director. &#8220;It is also vital to make sure that any action ensures the protection of civilians in the surrounding areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>So clearly there is more to the problem than just finding Kony by making him famous, as IC hopes to do. But, if finding him and bringing him to justice are done carefully and properly, supported by recovery efforts to aid his victims, it would be a huge step forward for the people of central Africa who have suffered long enough.</p>
