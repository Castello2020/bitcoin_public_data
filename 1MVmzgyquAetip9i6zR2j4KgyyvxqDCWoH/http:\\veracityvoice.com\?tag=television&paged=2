			<p><strong>Are the Warring Parties Playing Round Two of Geneva II?</strong></p>
<div><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Syrian-Orthodox-Church3.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p><em>El Nubek, Syria</em> &#8211; As two delegations, one representing the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, led by Bashar Assad, and the other claiming to represent the popular opposition which is seeking its overthrow, arrived in Switzerland this morning to continue with Round Two of Geneva II, there is uncertainty over the agenda and whether to extend this weekend’s 36 hour “Humanitarian pause” to allow aid into the Old City of Homs.  Such a deal, which could come at any time, would bolster confidence ahead of the Round Two of the peace talks.</p>
<p>Some observers, including this one, predict that the ceasefire will in fact be extended as a result of a meeting on 2/10/14 being held between Syrian government officials here in Homs and UN representatives that will likely result in more civilians being allowed out of the old city later today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>But it is not certain.  And meanwhile, on 2/10/14, the meager amounts of aid trickling into Yamouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus was stopped due to  yet another breach of a “humanitarian pause” that was agreed upon last week.</p>
<p>The governor of Homs, Talal al-Barazi, has advised journalists and observers gathered in his office yesterday that the ceasefire may be extended by a further three days; to allow all those who might want to leave the chance to do so. The operation to help trapped civilians in Homs was the one concrete agreement reached at recent peace talks in Geneva, which are due to resume on Monday.</p>
<p>There remains much mistrust and plenty of PR jockeying from both sides as the public awaits the sound of the gavel from UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to resume discussions to end the killing in Syria. The new opposition team, at press time, is not fully identified but has announced that it wants the focus of Round Two to be solely or how to transition ( it demands a  clean slate in Damascus)  and nothing else.</p>
<p>In contradistinction, Syrian government Presidential Political and Media Adviser Dr. Buthaina Shaaban argues that the continuing essential problem in the search for a political solution through the Geneva track lies in the fact that “we don’t know whom is representing those who came by the name of opposition, how many, and what is their relation to Syria.”  She added that the coalition delegation came to Geneva for discussing one word in the 12/12/13 Geneva I Communiqué; transition.  Whereas the Syrian official delegation wants initially to discuss the first item in the Communiqué, the halt of violence, combating terrorism and the preservation of state institutions.</p>
<p>Whether there will be an extension of the just competed “three day” humanitarian pause cease-fire” is not yet sure. In point of clarification, the  so-called “three day” partial ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid to the area which for more than 600 days has experienced nearly daily bombardment of the city which is labeled by some as the ‘Birthplace of the Revolution.” is a misnomer in the extreme. The so-called “Humanitarian Pause” such as it was, never comprised three days. Rather in reality it was for less than 36 hours given that aid deliveries and evacuations were strictly limited to 12 hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. over three days. </p>
<p>One spokesman for a European aid organization, attempted to enlighten this observer on the ceasefire terms by claiming that “After 6 p.m. any aid distributors within a snipers scope is fair game and they are for warned. I told them it is kind of like caveat emptor after six or before six.”</p>
<p>Frankly, the gentleman could not be more mistaken and he should have known better given his job. His view constitutes a shocking and fundamentally flawed edict  and misstatement of applicable binding international norms anchored in black letter public international humanitarian law, including but not limited to the Geneva Conventions and other principles, standards and rule of international humanitarian law requiring protection by all belligerents of aid workers whenever and wherever they perform their humanitarian work.  Nor can International customary law and treaty law on this subject be abrogated bilaterally by warring parties who may choose not to kill aid workers or civilians only during a mutually declared 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. day shift.</p>
<p>The aid workers in Homs, as are all civilians, are inviolate during military action.  Nor is there any suggestion that either party has complied international law, which requires all warring factions to allow unconditional humanitarian access. It is no excuse, but there does appear, according to information given to these observers from local residents, that more than 30 different armed groups operate in the Old City, making any agreement among them unlikely.  The  Regional Advisor of UNICEF,  Mr. Geoffrey Ijumba a reasonable sounding fellow, claims that “the main stumbling block is that the 30 plus militia groups inside Homs want guarantees that the aid will still be delivered to the Old City once the civilians are evacuated.” An extended ceasefire, given recent government military gains is, according to some observers monitoring developments in Homs, a rather tough precondition to expect from the Syrian government given the price it has paid for advancing militarily over the past two years in this area.</p>
<p>There is currently plenty of mistrust and much PR jockeying from both sides. The new opposition team, at press time not fully identified, wants the focus of Round Two to be solely transition and nothing else. Syrian government Presidential Political and Media Adviser Dr. Buthaina Shaaban strongly argues that an essential problem in the search for a political solution through the Geneva track lies in the fact that “we don’t know whom is representing those who came by the name of opposition, how many, and what is their relation to Syria.”  She added that the coalition delegation came to Geneva for discussing one word in the Geneva I Communiqué; transition whereas  the Syrian official delegation wants initially to discuss the first item  in the Communiqué, the halt of  violence, combating terrorism and the preservation of state institutions. For its part, Damascus has been keen to portray the humanitarian deal outside the framework of talks, with pundits and parliamentarians taking to the airwaves to tout the deal as evidence of the government’s ongoing efforts to aid civilians. It has come under pressure from its allies Russia and Iran to make humanitarian concessions.</p>
<p>Predictably perhaps, both sides accuse the other of violations of the claimed three-day humanitarian aid ceasefire as the Opposition team announced that its delegation to “Round Two” was being re-configured.  Many observers of Genera II judged that the strong personalities and intellects of the Syrian delegation, including Foreign Minister Walid Mouallum, Dr. Bouthania Shaaban, and Minister of Information Omran Zoubi as well as Faisal Mekdad, among others, “won” Round I of the public relations challenge of G II and that the Obama Administration via John Kerry advised the opposition to that, “It had better field a stronger team or risk losing ground”.</p>
<p>The first civilians were evacuated from a rebel-held area of the Syrian city of Homs on 2/8/14 after more than a year and half of struggling to survive. Six buses arrived with three UN vehicles and six Red Crescent ambulances to pick up women, children, and elderly. Dina Elkassaby, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program, said its staff had reported that many of the evacuees were in “very, very bad shape,” with children showing signs of malnutrition.</p>
<p>Humanitarian workers braved mortar shells and gunfire on 2/9/14 as they pushed forward with their mission to deliver aid into besieged parts of the Syrian city of Homs through Jouret al Shayah al Qoubaisi. 12 civilians came out on the first bus from the rebel enclave.</p>
<p>Syria state television said four members of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARCS) were wounded by  ”armed terrorist groups”,  on 2/9/14)as the aid workers tried to deliver humanitarian supplies to a besieged, rebel-held district of Homs city. At sunset on 2/9/14 Abu Bilal, an activist trapped in the old city since June 2012 explained: “We hope more aid will come in, and we hope the civilians can be evacuated, but we don’t know whether that will happen. We are afraid that we will only see more of yesterday’s shelling.” The Syrian Red Crescent Society told observers that it has been “a challenge” to get its staff and the UN team out of the area. SARCS official Khaled Erksoussi said the convoy came under attack from mortars and gunfire as it was leaving the Qarabis neighborhood.</p>
<p>Many of those evacuated on 2/7/14 looked frail and described extreme hardships inside the area, which has been under army siege for nearly a year-and-a-half. They said bread had not been available for months, and many residents were gathering weeds and leaves to eat. As the BBC’s Lyse Doucet reported:  “The tide of people continued &#8211; elderly men and women on stretchers or crutches, exhausted mothers in tears, children who went straight into the arms of waiting aid officials from the UN and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society. Water, bread, even polio vaccinations were provided on the spot. Many residents who have finally escaped speak of having only grass and olives to eat.” </p>
<p>On Sunday, 2/9/14, 611 civilians, an increase from 83 on 2/7/14, who were besieged for more than 600 days in the old city of Homs were evacuated, the majority being women, children and elderly. According to one of the Governate of Homs officials responsible for monitoring their evacuation, their ages ranged between 16 and 54 years of age. It is not yet clear if the warring parties will agree to a three day (36 hour) extension of the aid mission and if so that it will be honored.  The governor of Homs, Talal al-Barazi sated on 2/0/14 that his administration will cooperate if the UN mission and the Syrian Red Crescent are the ones delivering the aid.  Food and hygiene kits and have also been distributed in the neighborhoods of Bustan al-Diwan and al-Hamidieh.</p>
<p>The humanitarian aid gesture in the Old City of Homs is modest, compared to the more than four million civilians living under siege across this great country, being war deprived of adequate food, water, or sanitation. In all, some 9.3 million people in Syria need some form of aid, according to the U.N.</p>
<p>This past week, the U.N. Security Council pushed for a resolution that would enable broad-based aid deliveries to Syria. So did France. On the morning of 2/10/14, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France and other countries would present a resolution at the UN calling for greater access for humanitarian aid. He told the media in Homs and internationally, “It is absolutely scandalous that there have been discussions for quite a while and that people are still being starved every day, and so along with a number of other countries, we will present a resolution at the UN along those lines.”  Yet, many in Homs voice skepticism that Moscow would allow UN Security Council Chapter Seven action given its rivalry with Washington on this and other Syria related regional issues.</p>
<p>Some 3,000 people are slated to receive aid during the humanitarian pause. At sunset on 2/9/14 Abu Bilal, an activist trapped in the old city since June 2012 explained: “We hope more aid will come in, and we hope the civilians can be evacuated, but we don’t know whether that will happen. We are afraid that we will only see more of yesterday’s shelling.”</p>
<p>It appears certain that in the coming few days the intentions of both sides will become clearer with respect to the Geneva process and their willingness to allow full humanitarian aid into Homs and the evacuation of those who want to exit the Old City.</p>
<p>Whichever side fails in its humanitarian duties will be harshly judged by history and quite possibly by a Special Tribunal for Syria, already being planned by some, to be held at The Hague.</p>

<p>Few subjects present an undisputable window into modern society than the electronic version of reality that is dispensed through television broadcasts. This technology does not require interactive skills or critical thinking acumen. Just watch and fall into a daydream trance. TV is the stealth killer that penetrates 114.7 million American households. According to <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2011/nielsen-estimates-number-of-u-s-television-homes-to-be-114-7-million.html">Nielsen</a>, the 2012 Universe Estimate (UE), reflects a reduction in the estimated percent of U.S. homes with a television set (TV penetration), which declined to 96.7 percent from 98.9 percent. Should this turn down suggest promise or is it merely a result of internet substitution?</p>
<p>With the proliferation of cable channels and 24 hour programming, the landscape of TV addiction vastly impacts perception and dramatically excludes normal interpersonal relations. Melissa Melton cites the following in her article, <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/tv-your-mind-controlled/">TV: Your Mind. Controlled</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;According to last year’s <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/americans-spend-34-hours-week-watching-tv-nielsen-numbers-article-1.1162285">Nielsen report</a>, the average American over the age of two years old watches more than 34 hours of television per week, plus at least three more hours of taped programming. The report also noted that the amount of time we spend watching television increases as we get older.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This overwhelming intrusion into and over personal time and space are often called entertainment. Broadcasts that bill themselves as news or business shows claim to provide useful information. Sport coverage makes no pretense of presenting socially significant content. Yet, vast segments of the public are wrapped up in the childish exercise of false hero adoration.</p>
<p>Television’s reporting on politics is miserable by any coherent standard of journalism. The business of television has little to do with an accurate chronicle of events or the meaning of decisions and actions. In order to understand the objectives of the content producers and the basic purpose behind the cultural soothsayers, a review of <a href="http://www.crazations.tv/index.php/mind-control">Mind Control Theories and Techniques used by Mass Media</a>, which is a well documented source that outlines how the mass media really operates, is useful. Examine the specifics and draw your own lessons.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mass media is the most powerful tool used by the ruling class to manipulate the masses. It shapes and molds opinions and attitudes and defines what is normal and acceptable. This article looks at the workings of mass media through the theories of its major thinkers, its power structure and the techniques it uses, in order to understand its true role in society.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The conclusion of this account is a valid summary.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Lippmann, Bernays and Lasswell have all declared that the public are not fit to decide their own fate, which is the inherent goal of democracy. Instead, they called for a cryptocracy, a hidden government, a ruling class in charge of the &#8220;bewildered herd.&#8221; As their ideas continue to be applied to society, it is increasingly apparent that an ignorant population is not an obstacle that the rulers must deal with: It is something that is DESIRABLE and, indeed, necessary, to insure total leadership. An ignorant population does not know its rights, does not seek a greater understanding of issues and does not question authorities. It simply follows trends. Popular culture caters to and nurtures ignorance by continually serving up brain-numbing entertainment and spotlighting degenerate celebrities to be idolized. Many people ask me: &#8220;Is there a way to stop this?&#8221; Yes, there is. STOP BUYING THEIR CRAP AND READ A BOOK.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Such a sensible solution as turning off the misinformation screen is not an option for most of the typical dullards that think of themselves as normal and informed citizens. Society is populated with marginally functional and enthusiastic compliant serfs. Contentment is judged by actions not merely by sentiment. An unquestioning and obedient populace perpetually distracted from serious issues and unaware of comprehending the linkage and ultimate aims behind world events, has always been the goal.</p>
<p>The most profound use of these media techniques usually deal with War &amp; Peace: Media and War. Stanford University publishes this account by Johnnie Manzaria &amp; Jonathon Bruck, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/e297c/war_peace/media/hpropaganda.html">Media&#8217;s Use of Propaganda to Persuade People&#8217;s Attitude, Beliefs and Behaviors</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Propaganda is so powerful because everyone is susceptible to it. This is true as explained by Robert Cialdini, an expert in influence, because people exist in a rapidly moving and complex world. In order to deal with it, we need shortcuts. We cannot be expected to recognize and analyze all the aspects in each person, event, and situation we encounter in even one day. We do not have the time, energy, or capacity to process the information; and instead we must very often use our stereotypes, our rules of thumb, to classify things according to a few key features and then to respond without thinking when one or another of these trigger feature are present (Cialdini 6). While this makes people highly susceptible to a propagandist who understands persuasion, in general it is the most efficient form of behaving, and in other cases it is simply necessary. Additionally, propaganda includes the reinforcement of societal myths and stereotypes that are so deeply embedded within a culture that it is often difficult to recognize the message as propaganda.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The attitude that such practices are &#8220;most efficient form of behaving, and in other cases it is simply necessary&#8221;, is most disturbing and certainly fits the mold of how TV operates.</p>
<p>The examples cited in this case study deal with foreign policy issues. However, the summary on How to Defend Against Propaganda, is worth a look.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a result of our increasing sophistication and to build our civilization, we have created and environment so complex, so fast-paced, and information-laden, that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion of the animals we long ago transcended. Thus, from the case studies on how the media uses propaganda, we can understand that the media does more than presentation facts and information. The media has the ability to exploit persuasive tactics to the specific definition of propaganda: the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now ponder the disclaimer from this academia project: &#8220;We are not advocating that propaganda is wrong; we have tried to show, that overall it is usually helpful to respond to messages mindlessly, and that the truly only way to defend against it is to be more aware of the tactics being used.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also referenced in this study is Phil Zimbardo.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>1) Be aware of the general perspective that others use to frame the problem or issue at hand, because accepting their frame on their terms gives them a powerful advantage.</p>
<p>2) Be sensitive to situational demands however trivial they may seem: group norms, group pressures, symbols of authority, slogans, and commitments. Don&#8217;t believe in simple solutions to complex personal, social, and political problems.</p>
<p>3) In the end, it must be remembered that it is not enough to dissent vocally &#8212; one must be willing to disobey, to defy, to challenge, and to suffer any ensuing consequences of these actions.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Relate this thinking to the television broadcasts and series that occupy the gratuitous viewing of the general-public. It may be functionally realistic not to expect current event discernment from the mediocre crowd, but what motivates these distraction deprived viewers from absorbing the brainwashing message?</p>
<p>Escape from reality probably is the most adept answer. Nonetheless, the dependency on relinquishing individual responsibility and living under the principle of personal integrity is too difficult for most. The easy way out is to believe the junk fed from the TV screen.</p>
<p>Newspeak has become the dominant culture and TV is the chief vehicle for spreading the lies and deceit. Jack Blood provides a succinct summary in, <a href="http://deadlinelive.info/2012/05/27/tv-mind-control-why-do-you-think-they-call-it-programming/">TV = Mind Control (Why do you think they call it Programming?)</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Once again the system is at work, knowing how easy it is to control the minds of a dumbed down population that has been well trained, and some might say socially engineered, to never question authority, never think outside the box, never seek accountability and never think for itself. Easily manipulated, millions of people are conditioned to believe, from a very early age, that anything emanating from television is sacrosanct. Thus, everything they watch is reality and anything they hear is truth. Anchors and reporters become trusted personalities voicing reticent opinions whose veracity are seldom, if ever, questioned.</p>
<p>The Establishment has perfected its machination of propaganda, creating the realities it wants into society, forming whatever truth that will be of the greatest benefit, not to society, but to itself. Whatever reality it wants to create and disseminate is quickly absorbed by a population eager to feed off the mammary glands of television. The Establishment, the corporate world and government have for years told us how and what to think, how to act, who to obey and where to follow, condemning our minds to obedience, our lives to conformism and silent acquiescence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it not time to make a clean break from this self-induced imprisonment of images and sounds that spills out of the television machine?</p>

<p>A book review: Who Lost America? by Bromwell Ault&#8230;</p>
<p>Part 2: Institutional failure, loss of enforcing the rule of law, injection of incompatible diversity.</p>
<p>History becomes the great mentor for any civilization hoping to outlast the ages.  For all its bloody conflicts, history presents every country lessons from the past on how other nations failed to survive.</p>
<p>But in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, America’s leaders and its citizens ignore the lessons of history.  And, ironically, as America becomes less and less of its own people and more and more of dissimilar people from around the world, it won’t be able to return itself to its intellectual, cultural, linguistic and spiritual foundation.</p>
<p>Former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm said, “If you believe that America is too smug, too self-satisfied, too rich, then let’s destroy America.  It is not that hard to do.  No nation in history has survived the ravages of time.”</p>
<p>Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall, and that, “An autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.”</p>
<p>In his newest book, <b>Who Lost America?</b>—Yale University graduate Bromwell Ault, at 86 years of age, brings enormous historical perspective to the American predicament.</p>
<p>“History is an excellent teacher,” said Ault. “To some degree it is infallible.  It is both the messenger and message, and writes our records. In the end, it determines who survives and who doesn’t, and more importantly, what is and what isn’t.  It leaves little room for argument when it is being written and even less thereafter.”</p>
<p>Every high school student learns how Rome fell.  Every student of history knows how Easter Island’s civilization collapsed into extinction. A quick reading tells all of us why the Mayan civilization vanished.  Historical records show why the Pueblo people of Mesa Verde disappeared from their homes in the rock walls of that ancient civilization.</p>
<p>But do you think the citizens and leaders of America in the 21<sup>st</sup> century take note of the causes of those collapsed civilizations?   Do you think we Americans are taking actions to avoid our own definite collapse of our civilization?  The empirical and unavoidable answer: no!  In reality, we follow in the footsteps of those ancient civilizations of history that collapsed.</p>
<p>“The legislative branch of our government, with the power and responsibility to create and pass our laws,” said Ault,  “is riven with so many divisions that its 535 members in the House and Senate are more and more to be found at the far ends of the political spectrum without a refuge of reason at the center.  In our time and place, it is a catastrophe.  How did it his happen and why do we permit it”</p>
<p>When you look at our 10 million unemployed and 7 million underemployed, or 48 million citizens subsisting on food stamps, or our $18 trillion national debt, or our $315 billion annual trade deficit to China, or our useless 10-year wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—you cannot help but lament the devolvement of our country into a horrendous geopolitical hole from which we may not recover.</p>
<p>When you look at our racial strife that dominates the headlines or our porous borders that our Congress facilitated to allow over 12 to 20 million people to cross without invitation or legality—you cannot help but wonder who pretends to be in charge of our laws.  The agony of 68 percent of our African-American children being brought up by a single mother on welfare—speaks to something terribly wrong.</p>
<p>Who lost America?  We citizens gave our country away to power mongers, to the military industrial complex, which foments foreign wars out of fabrications of fear, and to institutional failures.</p>
<p>“To protect ourselves, we must change our concept of power,” said Ault, “and elect as president, not someone who merely wants power, but someone who can wield it in a moral and balanced way…the great fault of government in America today is that it is considered a means, not and end.  It means our elected representatives connive in the distribution of our national political and material resources to favored areas or interests.  We have badly abused our democracy and in the process have done ourselves great disservice.”</p>
<p>In essence, we gave the military-industrial-complex a cart blanche pass to create Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Afghanistan and Iraq (twice).  No one questions those dishonest wars even after the evidence shows that our leaders contrived those conflicts.</p>
<p>What causes those manufactured wars?  Answer: money.  Corporations make a lot of money.  A lot of kids die for that money someone else makes.</p>
<p>Ault said, “Money flows in almost unimaginable amounts throughout our political process and is constantly directed and redirected by the same people to the same places.”</p>
<p>Ault describes how conflicted religions faced each other on the battlefields with swords, spears, maces and longbows.  Their cruelty such as the Christians on the Crusades against the Muslims of the 11<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup>centuries engaged extreme barbarism on both sides.  Today, Muslims commit horrific-barbaric acts against the West, but in return, the West bombs and kills hundreds of thousands of Muslims in their own lands.  With countries like Syria, Muslims shoot, bomb, poison and kill each other with prolific enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Ault describes Rome’s fall to its endless immigration that destroyed its cohesive military into the chaos of the Goths, Visa-Goths and Vandals.  Rome lost its cultural foundation along with its language.</p>
<p>“As to immigration, enter the Kudzu Curve,” said Ault.  “Extend it another 50 years and our America will join the Easter Island sculptures looking for help that will not come.”</p>
<p>What Americans don’t realize continues at breakneck speed: America will change from a 90 percent European majority to a Latino majority by 2042—a scant 28 years from now. That means our major language, English, will share center stage with Spanish.  Our national ethos faces radical change.</p>
<p>“Can this come to pass?” said Ault. “And why is it considered a very real possibility by many Americans.  For an answer, it is only necessary to look to Europe.  We have seats, front and center, to observe the deadly results of unchecked immigration in France, Germany, England, Denmark, Norway, Netherlands and Italy where former colonial powers are being swamped by constant third world arrivals, mostly from Africa or the Near East, and mostly Muslims.</p>
<p>“The result has been extreme violence in the streets with random acts of murder, rape, torture and extensive property damage.  To look at the European history, to listen to the arguments on both sides, to observe the results, and then to think it can’t happen here is sheer folly.”</p>
<p>By reading Ault’s book and watching television nightly, you cannot help but “connect the dots” on how we lost America and how fast we continue losing it even further to a peaceful, self-invited invasion via immigration.</p>
<p>Ironically, the latest S744 amnesty bill doubled legal immigration from 1 million to 2 million annually. If it passes, ultimately the rate of speed of immigration leading to an added 100 million immigrants by 2050 shall accelerate at twice the velocity.</p>
<p>Our ultimate destination places a special ring to Toybee’s words: “All great civilizations rise and fall, and that, an autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.”</p>

<h3>&#8220;Bias in favor of the orthodox is frequently mistaken for ‘objectivity’. Departures from this ideological orthodoxy are themselves dismissed as ideological.&#8221; – Michael Parenti</h3>
<p>An exchange in January with Paul Farhi, <em>Washington Post</em> columnist, about coverage of US foreign policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Farhi,</p>
<p>Now that you’ve done a study of al-Jazeera’s political bias in supporting Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, is it perhaps now time for a study of the US mass media’s bias on US foreign policy? And if you doubt the extent and depth of this bias, consider this:</p>
<p>There are more than 1,400 daily newspapers in the United States. Can you name a single paper, or a single TV network, that was unequivocally opposed to the American wars carried out against Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Panama, Grenada, and Vietnam? Or even opposed to any two of these wars? How about one? In 1968, six years into the Vietnam war, the <em>Boston Globe</em>  surveyed the editorial positions of 39 leading US papers concerning the war and found that “none advocated a pull-out”.</p>
<p>Now, can you name an American daily newspaper or TV network that more or less gives any support to any US government ODE (Officially Designated Enemy)? Like Hugo Chávez of Venezuela or his successor, Nicolás Maduro; Fidel or Raúl Castro of Cuba; Bashar al-Assad of Syria; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran; Rafael Correa of Ecuador; or Evo Morales of Bolivia? I mean that presents the ODE’s point of view in a reasonably fair manner most of the time? Or any ODE of the recent past like Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Moammar Gaddafi of Libya, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, or Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti?</p>
<p>Who in the mainstream media supports Hamas of Gaza? Or Hezbollah of Lebanon? Who in the mainstream media is outspokenly critical of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians? And keeps his or her job?</p>
<p>Who in the mainstream media treats Julian Assange or Chelsea Manning as the heroes they are?</p>
<p>And this same mainstream media tell us that Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, et al. do not have a real opposition media.</p>
<p>The ideology of the American mainstream media is the belief that they don’t have any ideology; that they are instead what they call “objective”. I submit that there is something more important in journalism than objectivity. It is capturing the essence, or the truth, if you will, with the proper context and history. This can, as well, serve as “enlightenment”.</p>
<p>It’s been said that the political spectrum concerning US foreign policy in the America mainstream media “runs the gamut from A to B”.</p>
<p>Sincerely, William Blum, Washington, DC</p></blockquote>
<p>(followed by some of my writing credentials)</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Reply from Paul Farhi:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think you’re conflating news coverage with editorial policy. They are not the same. What a newspaper advocates on its editorial page (the Vietnam example you cite) isn’t the same as what or how the story is covered in the news columns. News MAY have some advocacy in it, but it’s not supposed to, and not nearly as overt or blatant as an editorial or opinion column. Go back over all of your ODE examples and ask yourself if the news coverage was the same as the opinions about those ODEs. In most cases. I doubt it was.</p></blockquote>
<p>–</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mr. Farhi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your remarkably prompt answer.</p>
<p>Your point about the difference between news coverage and editorial policy is important, but the fact is, as a daily, and careful, reader of the <em>Post</em> for the past 20 years I can attest to the extensive bias in its foreign policy coverage in the areas I listed. Juan Ferrero in Latin America and Kathy Lally in the Mideast are but two prime examples. The bias, most commonly, is one of omission more than commission; which is to say it’s what they leave out that distorts the news more than any factual errors or out-and-out lies. My <em>Anti-Empire Report</em> contains many examples of these omissions, as well as some errors of commission.</p>
<p>Incidentally, since 1995 I have written dozens of letters to the Post pointing out errors in foreign-policy coverage. Not one has been printed.</p>
<p>Happy New Year</p></blockquote>
<p>–</p>
<p>I present here an extreme example of bias by omission, in the entire American mainstream media: In my <a href="http://williamblum.org/aer/read/124">last report</a> I wrote of the committee appointed by the president to study NSA abuses – Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies – which actually came up with a few unexpected recommendations in its report presented December 13, the most interesting of which perhaps are these two:</p>
<p>“Governments should not use surveillance to steal industry secrets to advantage their domestic industry.”</p>
<p>“Governments should not use their offensive cyber capabilities to change the amounts held in financial accounts or otherwise manipulate the financial systems.”</p>
<p>So what do we have here? The NSA being used to steal industrial secrets; nothing to do with fighting terrorism. And the NSA stealing money and otherwise sabotaging unnamed financial systems, which may also represent gaining industrial advantage for the United States.</p>
<p>Long-time readers of this report may have come to the realization that I’m not an ecstatic admirer of US foreign policy. But this stuff shocks even me. It’s the gross pettiness of “The World’s Only Superpower”.</p>
<p>A careful search of the extensive Lexis-Nexis database failed to turn up a single American mainstream media source, print or broadcast, that mentioned this revelation. I found it only on those websites which carried my report, plus three other sites: Techdirt, Lawfare, and Crikey (First Digital Media).</p>
<p>For another very interesting and extreme example of bias by omission, as well as commission, very typical of US foreign policy coverage in the mainstream media: First read the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/at-markets-chavez-successor-falls-short/2014/01/31/ac85c62a-8518-11e3-a273-6ffd9cf9f4ba_story.html" target="_blank">January 31, page one, Washington Post article</a> making fun of socialism in Venezuela and Cuba.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://williamblum.org/aer-125-letters">read the response from two Americans</a> who have spent a lot of time in Venezuela, are fluent in Spanish, and whose opinions about the article I solicited.</p>
<p>I lived in Chile during the 1972-73 period under Salvadore Allende and his Socialist Party. The conservative Chilean media’s sarcastic claims at the time about shortages and socialist incompetence were identical to what we’ve been seeing for years in the United States concerning Venezuela and Cuba. The <em>Washington Post</em> article on Venezuela referred to above could have been lifted out of Chile’s <em>El Mercurio</em>, 1973.</p>
<p>[Note to readers: Please do not send me the usual complaints about my using the name “America(n)” to refer to “The United States”. I find it to be a meaningless issue, if not plain silly.]</p>
<h3>JFK, RFK, and some myths about US foreign policy</h3>
<p>On April 30, 1964, five months after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, was interviewed by John B. Martin in one of a series of oral history sessions with RFK. Part of the interview appears in the book “JFK Conservative” by Ira Stoll, published three months ago. (pages 192-3)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>RFK:</strong> The president … had a strong, overwhelming reason for being in Vietnam and that we should win the war in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> What was the overwhelming reason?</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> Just the loss of all of Southeast Asia if you lost Vietnam. I think everybody was quite clear that the rest of Southeast Asia would fall.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> What if it did?</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> Just have profound effects as far as our position throughout the world, and our position in a rather vital part of the world. Also it would affect what happened in India, of course, which in turn has an effect on the Middle East. Just as it would have, everybody felt, a very adverse effect. It would have an effect on Indonesia, hundred million population. All of those countries would be affected by the fall of Vietnam to the Communists.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> There was never any consideration given to pulling out?</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> … The president was convinced that we had to keep, had to stay in there …</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>MARTIN:</strong> … And couldn’t lose it.</p>
<p><strong>RFK:</strong> Yes.</p></blockquote>
<p>These remarks are rather instructive from several points of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>Robert Kennedy contradicts the many people who are convinced that, had he lived, JFK would have brought the US involvement in Vietnam to a fairly prompt end, instead of it continuing for ten more terrible years. The author, Stoll, quotes a few of these people. And these other statements are just as convincing as RFK’s statements presented here. And if that is not confusing enough, Stoll then quotes RFK himself in 1967 speaking unmistakably in support of the war.
<p>It appears that we’ll never know with any kind of certainty what would have happened if JFK had not been assassinated, but I still go by his Cold War record in concluding that US foreign policy would have continued along its imperial, anti-communist path. In Kennedy’s short time in office the United States unleashed many different types of hostility, from attempts to overthrow governments and suppress political movements to assassination attempts against leaders and actual military combat; with one or more of these occurring in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, British Guiana, Iraq, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Brazil.</li>
<li>“Just have profound effects as far as our position throughout the world, and our position in a rather vital part of the world.”
<p>Ah yes, a vital part of the world. Has there ever been any part of the world, or any country, that the US has intervened in that was not vital? Vital to American interests? Vital to our national security? Of great strategic importance? Here’s President Carter in his 1980 State of the Union Address: “An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America”.</p>
<p>“What a country calls its vital economic interests are not the things which enable its citizens to live, but the things which enable it to make war.” – Simone Weil (1909-1943), French philosopher</li>
<li>If the US lost Vietnam “everybody was quite clear that the rest of Southeast Asia would fall.”
<p>As I once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus it was that the worst of Washington’s fears had come to pass: All of Indochina – Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos – had fallen to the Communists. During the initial period of US involvement in Indochina in the 1950s, John Foster Dulles, Dwight Eisenhower and other American officials regularly issued doomsday pronouncements of the type known as the “Domino Theory”, warning that if Indochina should fall, other nations in Asia would topple over as well. In one instance, President Eisenhower listed no less than Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia amongst the anticipated “falling dominos”.</p>
<p>Such warnings were repeated periodically over the next decade by succeeding administrations and other supporters of US policy in Indochina as a key argument in defense of such policy. The fact that these ominous predictions turned out to have no basis in reality did not deter Washington officialdom from promulgating the same dogma up until the 1990s about almost each new world “trouble-spot”, testimony to their unshakable faith in the existence and inter-workings of the International Communist Conspiracy.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Killing suicide</h3>
<p>Suicide bombers have become an international tragedy. One can not sit in a restaurant or wait for a bus or go for a walk downtown, in Afghanistan or Pakistan or Iraq or Russia or Syria and elsewhere without fearing for one’s life from a person walking innocently by or a car that just quietly parked nearby. The Pentagon has been working for years to devise a means of countering this powerful weapon.</p>
<p>As far as we know, they haven’t come up with anything. So I’d like to suggest a possible solution. Go to the very source. Flood selected Islamic societies with this message: “There is no heavenly reward for dying a martyr. There are no 72 beautiful virgins waiting to reward you for giving your life for jihad. No virgins at all. No sex at all.”</p>
<p>Using every means of communication, from Facebook to skywriting, from billboards to television, plant the seed of doubt, perhaps the very first such seed the young men have ever experienced. As some wise anonymous soul once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>A person is unambivalent only with regard to those few beliefs, attitudes and characteristics which are truly universal in his experience. Thus a man might believe that the world is flat without really being aware that he did so – if everyone in his society shared the assumption. The flatness of the world would be simply a “self-evident” fact. But if he once became <em>conscious</em> of thinking that the world is flat, he would be capable of conceiving that it might be otherwise. He might then be spurred to invent elaborate proofs of its flatness, but he would have lost the innocence of absolute and unambivalent belief.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have to capture the minds of these suicide bombers. At the same time we can work on our own soldiers. Making them fully conscious of their belief, their precious belief, that their government means well, that they’re fighting for freedom and democracy, and for that thing called “American exceptionalism”. It could save them from committing their own form of suicide.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Reuters News reported that a nationwide poll conducted of the Russian people found that former dictator Josef Stalin was voted the third most popular historical figure. Over one-third of the Russian population participated in the poll.</p>
<p>See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2F2008%2F12%2F28%2Fus-russia-stalin-idUSTRE4BR17620081228%3FfeedType%3DRSS%26feedName%3DtopNews&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeQ36qPcP7bSYa2fYgEEDSqWWCsg" target="_blank">Dictator Stalin Voted Third Most Popular Russian</a></p>
<p>Can you imagine? Stalin just might be the greatest mass-murderer in human history. Estimates of the body count during Stalin’s reign of terror range anywhere from 20-60 million, and that doesn’t include the millions of people who were starved, imprisoned, and tortured but who didn’t die. Only China’s Mao Tse-tung rivals Stalin’s butchery. Then, again, many Chinese people still love Mao Tse-tung, too.</p>
<p>How is it that people can laud and honor tyrants and butchers? How can people so easily submit to slavery and despotism?</p>
<p>No tyrant rises to power calling himself a tyrant. Tyranny is never sold as tyranny. Every tyrannical regime of history considered itself to be patriotic and compassionate; and the people who supported and submitted to such regimes considered themselves to be patriotic and compassionate, as well. The police state is never called that by those who promote it; they call it “law and order,” “keeping the peace,” “protecting the homeland,” etc.</p>
<p>Ask the average American today about the possibility that our country could become a police state and the common response is, “That could never happen here.” But, ladies and gentlemen, it is already happening here. And, furthermore, it seems that the vast majority of the American people are all in favor it. Republicans love it; Democrats love it; Christians love it; politicians love it; police officers love it; pastors love it; school teachers love it; businessmen love it; everyone loves a police state.</p>
<p>Threaten to remove Phil Robertson from Duck Dynasty, and Christians and conservatives come out of the woodwork in righteous indignation. Threaten to put a Nativity scene on some courthouse lawn, and Democrats and liberals come out of the woodwork in righteous indignation. But propose laws that strip the American people of their God-ordained liberties protected by the Bill of Rights, and conservatives and liberals alike, Christians and unbelievers alike, think it’s just about the greatest thing since sliced bread.</p>
<p>You don’t believe that? Try this news story on for size:</p>
<p>According to a World Net Daily report, “The 2014 NDAA was fast-tracked through the U.S. Senate, with no time for discussion or amendments, while most Americans were distracted by the scandal surrounding A&amp;E’s troubles with ‘Duck Dynasty’ star Phil Robertson.</p>
<p>“Eighty-five of 100 senators voted in favor of the new version of the NDAA, which had already been quietly passed by the House of Representatives.”</p>
<p>The report continued saying, “Section 1021 allows the detention of anyone, including American citizens, by the military, if the president considers that person to have helped with terror.”</p>
<p>The report further said, “Congress specifically expressed its desire for the detention provision to apply to American citizens even on American soil by rejecting multiple amendments that would have exempted them.”</p>
<p>So, where are the notable leaders of the Religious Right? Where are the liberal groups? Where is the national media? Where are the talking heads from the right and the left? With precious few exceptions, they are absolutely silent on the subject. Why? Because they like it.</p>
<p>Liberals never met a big-government program or proposal they didn’t like. If it increases the size and scope of government, liberals love it. Conservatives love anything that smacks of “law and order.” (A word of caution: you never want to be the defendant in a courtroom where the jury is stacked with conservatives. If you do, you’re dead meat, friend.) And Christians get goose bumps up their spine about anything they think resembles Romans 13. Give government more power over our lives and listen to the Hallelujahs ringing out from the all of these 501c3 churches. And ditto for most of the talking heads on radio and television and the vast majority of the pundits and spokesmen from the national news media. Like I said, everyone loves a police state.</p>
<p>Well, not everyone, thank God!</p>
<p>The same WND report mentioned above states, “Some of the nation’s most respected legal teams are asking the Supreme Court to take up a challenge to the indefinite-detention provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act, charging the law has created the framework for a police state.</p>
<p>“The controversial provision authorizes the military, under presidential authority, to arrest, kidnap, detain without trial and hold indefinitely American citizens thought to ‘represent an enduring security threat to the United States.’</p>
<p>“Journalist Chris Hedges is among the plaintiffs charging the law could be used to target journalists who report on terror-related issues.</p>
<p>A friend-of-the-court brief submitted in the case states: ‘The central question now before this court is whether the federal judiciary will stand idly by while Congress and the president establish the legal framework for the establishment of a police state and the subjugation of the American citizenry through the threat of indefinite military arrest and detention, without the right to counsel, the right to confront one’s accusers, or the right to trial.’</p>
<p>“The brief was submitted to the Supreme Court by attorneys with the U.S. Justice Foundation of Ramona, Calif., Friedman Harfenist Kraut &amp; Perlstein of Lake Success, N.Y., and William J. Olson, P.C. of Vienna, Va.”</p>
<p>See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnd.com%2F2014%2F01%2Fcongress-grants-obama-free-rein-for-martial-law%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqbr4ed2OUneJJxS1ByeSHbFnwHg" target="_blank">Congress Grants Obama Free Rein For Martial Law</a></p>
<p>Believe it or not, there was a time in this country when people from both sides of the political aisle believed in freedom. I know it’s hard to imagine, but there was a time in this country when pastors from virtually every denomination believed in freedom. Not only did they believe in it; they fought for it. It seems like a long time ago.</p>
<p>Have you taken a close look at your State and local police agencies lately? More and more, our police officers and sheriff’s deputies resemble soldiers more than they do peace officers. I challenge you to Google “police abuse.” What you will discover will shock you. And, for all intents and purposes, the folks who live in many Northeastern states&#8212;along with California and Illinois&#8211;are already living in a State that is more controlled than many foreign countries, including some of the countries that we would call oppressive. And even our freer states are feeling the heavy hand of Big Brother more and more each day.</p>
<p>In fact, if you want to really get a taste of a police state, just move into some neighborhoods with their Gestapo-like Home Owner Associations (HOA). I’m telling you, some of these HOA rival anything Adolf Hitler could dream up.</p>
<p>Folks, take a good, hard look at reality: America is already in the beginning throes of a police state. Orwell’s “1984” and Huxley’s “Brave New World” are here. And far, far too many people seem fine with it.</p>
<p>I tell you the truth: I am to the point where I don’t know what to call myself. “Conservative” means nothing today. Nothing! One can be a “conservative” and believe in Big Government, undeclared wars of intervention, debt-driven economics, socialized medicine, increased taxes, and, of course, a police state. Likewise, “Christian” means nothing today. Nothing! One can be a “Christian” and believe in Big Government, undeclared wars of intervention, debt-driven economics, socialized medicine, increased taxes, and, of course, a police state. Oh, many “conservatives” and “Christians” might SAY they don’t believe in these things, but their actions (or lack of them) speak louder than their words.</p>
<p>A big THANK YOU is in order for Bill Olson, Herb Titus, Chris Hedges, et al. And THANK YOU to all of you folks out there who see what’s going on and are actively engaged in “the holy cause of liberty.” (Patrick Henry) I am your brother and compatriot, no matter what you call yourself. At this point, we aren’t conservatives or liberals, Christians or unbelievers; we are freedomists or statists.</p>
<p>Tyrants such as Joe Stalin and Mao Tse-tung might be popular with some people, and a burgeoning police state might be popular with some people, but there is a whole host of us in these United States who aren’t going to the gulags and gas chambers peacefully. And unlike the peasants of Europe and Asia, we aren’t surrendering our means of self-defense, either.</p>
<p>No, not everyone loves a police state.</p>

<p><em>Damascus - </em>As a new workweek begins here is Damascus many citizens across a fairly broad spectrum appear to be backing, and even exhibiting a kind of pride for their diplomatic team at the Geneva II conference. It might appear flippant for this observer to suggest that returning to  Damascus after recent events in his neighborhood of Haret Hriek in Dahiyeh, South Beirut sort of feels like one has arrived in a peaceful holiday local rather stress free, but others have told me the same thing once they crossover from Lebanon. Damascus is currently the most quiet and ‘normal’ appearing that I have found this historic city for more than two years.</p>
<p>Damascenes to a person it appears, despite differing political views, are hoping for breakthroughs that just might bring an end to the carnage that has left virtually no one unaffected and has driven 9.5 million people from their homes, killed close to 140,000 and with more than 18,000 missing. These and many more tragedies creating a major humanitarian crisis both within Syria and among this birth place of civilization’s neighbors.</p>
<p>At the Set al Cham (Grandmother of Damascus) a home style cooking small restaurant around the corner from the Dama Rose hotel, close to where a rocket hit 30 yards outside the front entrance of the five star hotel last week and ignited half a dozen cars and shattered windows in this ‘security zone’, there are currently animated conversations about the Geneva II conference. They focus on the prospects for a ceasefire which all here apparently agree is the first essential step to ending the carnage ravaging this country for the past three years. The apparent imminent release of women and children from the more than 500 families who have for many months been trapped in the old city of Homs, Syria’s third largest city, has created some inchoate hope.  According to UN Mediator, Lakhdar Brahimi , men also will be allowed to leave once their names are vetted to screen ‘terrorists’ from slipping out, a common security measure around this region during siege lifts and mass evacuations. The population allowed to exit Homs will be received immediately by volunteers from the courageous and deeply humanitarian Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society (SARCS) and other humanitarian organizations that have stockpiled a range of urgently required necessities close by.  As in the case with Yarmouk Palestinian camp in south Damascus, itself still under tight siege this evening with snipers on rooftops scanning the streets and alleys below through their gun sites seeking targets, baby formula is one of the foodstuff items most in demand and urgently needed in order save infant lives since their starving mothers generally are no longer able to produce milk.</p>
<p>With respect to Yarmouk camp,  which if of grave concern here in Syria as it is internationally, this observer had an informative three hour meeting today at UNWRA HQ on Mezzeh Autostrda  with  Chief Field Education Program Director, Mohammad Ammouri, and Abdullah  Al Laham, Deputy Director of UNWRA in Syria. These gentlemen, Mr. Ammouri from Tantura village near Haifa, and Mr. Al Laham, from Bethlehem Occupied Palestine, devote their full schedules these days trying to get aid into Yarmouk, and to bring those under siege out. Both gentlemen gave this observer some reason to believe that finally an agreement, after more than half a dozen failed ones, might just stick tonight so that tomorrow UNWRA trucks, waiting nearby with more than 40,000 aid parcels can finally enter. Each aid box, contains rice, sugar, flour, dried milk, cooking oil and other basics and are designed to feed a family of five for two weeks (families up to eight in number will get one and one-half UNWRA boxes every two weeks) can finally enter. Syrians trapped in Yarmouk, who number more than 2000, will also receive the emergency parcels from UNWRA no questions asked. Mr. Al Laham raised his eyebrow a bit and did a sort of double-take when this observer asked him if like SARCS, UNWRA distributed the well-known World Food Program (WFP) or International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or OCHA (<i>Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</i>) family aid parcels. “No! No.  My dear. You see, we at UNWRA have our own aid parcels, in fact ours are bigger and better” he quickly exclaimed and then smiled a bit sheepishly.</p>
<p>Three days ago UNWRA believed they would finally be allowed to enter Yarmouk with aid but at it turned out only about 3% of the aid parcels they were trying to deliver to the more than 18,000 starving Palestinian refugees and Syrians still trapped was able to be distributed because all aid is still being blocked by various militia who themselves appear to be rather well fed, financed, and armed. We should know by tomorrow (1/28/14) if substantial aid will be allowed into Yarmouk and whether dying residents can be evacuated. UNWRA literally has the engines of its trucks idling nearby tonight and ready to move into the besieged camp on less than a minutes notice if they get a green light, this observer has just been advised.</p>
<p>One senses in Damascus that much of the population believes that what is happening at Geneva, are admittedly “half-steps” to use UN envoy Brahimi’s description for the progress so far in the desperate effort to save Syria, just might result in a breakthrough of sorts and then move toward  a cease-fire and the opening up of humanitarian aid corridors. A few hours ago, Syrian delegation member Dr. Bouthania Shaaban commented that today’s talks had been ‘professional’. This is a modest achievement even though both sides speak only to Envoy Brahimi and tend to avoid eye contact with their “negotiating partners” while entering and exiting the meeting room from doors at opposite ends.</p>
<p>Syria’s delegation in Geneva is led by a seasoned, smart, deeply knowledgeable formidable delegation that includes the power-house Foreign Minister Walid Muallum, a former Syrian Ambassador to Washington who has a reputation in the West and here as wily, profoundly intelligent,  tough at times and no-nonsense. “If no serious work sessions are held by [Saturday], the official Syrian delegation will leave Geneva due to the other side’s lack of seriousness or preparedness,” state television quoted Muallum as telling UN mediator Lakhdar Brahimi last Friday. Mr. Muallum is credited with brokering the deal with by Russia to remove Syria’s chemical weapons enabling the Assad regime to present his government as a partner in the project and thus to strengthen its claim to legitimacy.</p>
<p>Another delegation member is Syria’s Minister of Information Omran al- Zoubi. Mr al-Zoubi has been indefatigable these past many months and is well known to the international media for his personal warmth and direct talk and incisive articulations of his government’s interpretations of the crisis. During literally hundreds of   media interviews Mr. Zoubi has earned a reputation internationally and in Syria as being an insightful political analyst and a skilled lawyer, who does not mince or sugar his words but who is respectful of his audience.  From Derra next to the Jordanian where the crisis began and a Sunni Muslim, the Ministers commented late this afternoon that “We will stay here until we do the job. We will not be provoked. We will not retreat and we will be wise and flexible.”  And he added, anyone at Geneva II expecting the President’s removal was living “in a mythical world, and let them stay in Alice in Wonderland.”</p>
<p>Syrian delegation member and FM Muallum’s Deputy, Feisal Mdkdad, was described to this observer by one of his colleagues today as a deeply knowledgeable, unflappable career diplomat with deep knowledge of foreign policy issues facing Syria. Mr Makdad explained at Geneva today that his administration has been trying to send essential supplies to help beleaguered residents but not as much as they would have liked had got through, for two reasons: “The armed groups had kept firing at those who tried to take in aid and the weather has not been conducive to making the movement.”  He pledges that his government will persevere. He also insisted that “we don’t hold any children prisoners at all. We categorically deny that.” He claimed that the list supplied by the opposition was full of errors. “I have studied this list; 60 to 70 per cent of the names are not in prison, 20 per cent have already been freed. About the rest, we don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>In one sense, Syria’s diplomatic team in Geneva is anchored by Professor Bouthaina Shaaban who is Political and Media Adviser to Syrian President Assad. Syria’s former Minister of Expatriates, she is also a mother and recently a grandmother, writer and professor at Damascus University and earned her Ph.D. in English Literature from Warwick University in the UK. Dr. Shaaban was Hafez al Assad’s personal interpreter, is well known internationally and has studied and taught in the USA and earned her Doctorate at Warwick University in the UK. She has authorized several well received books including her latest volume on Syrian diplomacy. Many media critics concede that, as the New York Times wrote, that she is stellar when explaining Syrian governments views on foreign policy. Dr. Shaaban is the most sought after delegation member from either side for interviews partly because of her quality of humanizing the conflict and her obvious love of country and dedication to stopping the carnage while possessing a quality of connecting with interlocutors emotionally and intellectually.</p>
<p>It would not be shocking were the Syrian delegation were to feel a bit on the defensive given the lineup of those who want them to falter, but there is so far little sign that the Syrian delegation is exuding a temerity at all similar to the defense team in The Hague trying to hold its own before the Special Tribunal on Lebanon (STL). Rather it acknowledges that it has come to represent Syria and to struggle through a cumbersome, slow diplomacy to achieve a cease-fire, open corridors of humanitarian aid, participate in prisoner’s exchanges with various militia, hold a presidential election in the spring, and begin reconstruction of the massive war damage.</p>
<p>We will likely learn soon if Syria and indeed can work through a myriad of opposing deeply antagonistic negotiating adversaries to achieve a sustainable cease-fire, reconciliation, and reconstruction.  Its long suffering population demand and deserve no less.</p>

</div>
<p>A month ago, a student toting a shotgun, machete and 125 rounds of ammunition marched into Arapahoe High School in Denver, Colorado.  His target: to kill the debate teacher whom he felt treated him poorly.</p>
<p>On his way to the teacher, he shot a beautiful girl named Claire Davis in the face. She hung on for a week before dying of her wounds. The killer, a regular 17-year-old high school student, tall and lanky, with good looks, shot himself before Swat teams could reach him.</p>
<p>As a former teacher who started teaching in the 1970s, my colleagues and I could not imagine such violence. But here in Denver, we suffered Columbine shootings by Klebold and Harris when they mowed down a dozen kids and teachers.  Another killer shot and killed “Emily” in Bailey, Colorado a few years back. Recently, James Holmes marched into a Denver movie theater to unleash his own killing spree on a bunch of innocent movie attendees.</p>
<p>Even more disturbing: bullied teachers&#8211;145,100 public-School teachers physically attacked by students and 276,700 threatened with injury every year.</p>
<p>Over 4,800,000 women, both girlfriends and wives, suffering beatings by their men annually in the United States—a beating every 15 seconds.</p>
<p>According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, which includes crimes that were <em>not</em> reported to the police, 232,960 women suffer rape in the U.S. annually. That&#8217;s more than 600 women everyday.</p>
<p>The United States carried on two ten-year wars in Iraq and Afghanistan where we killed an estimated 250,000 civilians.  We killed many more Muslim fighters by the tens of thousands. We destroyed their country with our bombs. Because those third world countries lack birth records, identification and death certificates—the numbers could be much higher.</p>
<p>In most large city in America, such as Denver, newscasters relate killings every night of the week.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit and Los Angeles suffer gang killings nightly. </p>
<p>One in four children suffers bullying by a teen thug in high schools across America every day during school terms. In other words, our children cannot attend school without fear of being beat up, harassed, called names and demeaned by meaner, bigger students who have no other purpose in life but to manifest their thuggery.</p>
<p>What bothers me:  we promote horrific violence via our continuous wars promoted by bankers and the military industrial complex that profit at the cost of human lives. We promote TV violence such as “Criminal Minds” and “NCIS” where lots of people commit diabolical mayhem.  We support social media arcade games for kids like “Doom” and worse. Our movies feature horrific violence that pours into our kids minds and emotions.  It’s like the 60s movie “Clockwork Orange” seems normal.  You can watch television “Cops” where violence becomes normal.  Our drones in the Middle East kill any number of humans without identity.</p>
<p>Today, 68 percent of African-American children grow up under the parenting of single mothers and most of them living on welfare and food stamps.  Who babysits those kids? Answer: television.  What do they see?  Answer: violence.  How do they respond?  Answer: black flash mobs, “knockout” games, shoplifting and gang violence.</p>
<p>Over 2.3 million Americans languish in prison.  We spent $1 trillion in the last 43 years on the “War on Drugs”, but a pittance for raising healthy kids. Why haven’t we spent as much money on discovering peaceful ways to rear our children as we spend on killing other people in contrived wars?</p>
<p>This information bothers me because Claire Davis could have been my daughter.  Congresswoman Gabby Gifford could have been my friend.  Your kid might be the one being bullied. I suffered bullying and getting beat up as a skinny kid in grade school and high school. </p>
<p>Question: are we a moral and ethical civilization or do we feature immorality and unethical behavior manifested in our wars and violence as stated above?</p>
<p>Today, 2014, one in six Americans faces hunger.  That includes one in five children.  (Source: <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org">www.feedingamerica.org</a>)</p>
<p>What makes for peaceful, happy and contributing citizens?  Answer: jobs for parents, homes for kids, excellent schools, playgrounds, after school activities and positive guidance by two parents.</p>
<p>What can we do to change course toward a moral, ethical, peaceful and happy nation?</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to bring our troops home from Afghanistan and other countries around the world. Let our fathers come back home to be fathers instead of fighting useless wars.</li>
<li>We need to limit imports from China and other nations that take jobs away from our 14 million unemployed and 48 million citizens subsisting on food stamps.  We can make all those manufactured products as well as Chinese workers.</li>
<li>We need to stop importing 100,000 legal immigrants every 30 days into America that take jobs away from our own working poor.</li>
<li>We need turn our war machine money into production for alternative energy, conservation and environmental balance.</li>
<li>We need to pay teachers and educational professionals much better salaries in order to educate our children to the highest excellence for competing in the 21st century.  We need classes to teach parents how to parent with respect, loving discipline and positive living.  (Source: <a href="http://www.LoveandLogic.com">www.LoveandLogic.com</a>)</li>
<li>We need to examine how and why we create so much violence in our society. Then, we must take action to stop it such as stopping violent video games, stopping bullying by parenting peaceful kids, stopping TV violence seen by our young and stop glorifying war, violent movies and violent TV for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of a dozen other ideas, but in the end, if we keep doing what we’re doing, we will continue to suffer daughters, sons, fathers and mothers involved in violence and death.</p>

			<p><strong>The War Is Against Paganism&#8230;</strong></p>

Kingdoms rise and wane<br />

Gates of Hell can never<br />
‘Gainst the Church prevail<br />

</blockquote>
<p>“To gain this victory, we must wage the war.  Too many want victory without the war, as though eloquence, patriotic or religious gush, ever overcame an enemy.”  R. J.  Rushdoony,” Numbers” Pg. 270</p>
<p>Patty and I spent Christmas in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDestin%2C_Florida&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMTAlzLDogq1hcC87DeZ89oYRgJg" target="_blank">Destin, Florida</a>.  Destin is an upscale resort town named from a Yankee fisherman who settled there in the mid-Nineteenth Century.  It is home to one of the nation’s largest outlet malls.</p>
<p>In one of the shoe outlets we met a clerk from Maine.  Her story is typical of many who have been victimized by the massive changes that have been foisted on the world.  Born, raised, and married in a shoe prosperous Maine town, she and her husband had two children and were living lavishly.  He was a manager at a shoe manufacturing plant where she also worked.  Their combined income was in the high six figures providing them a luxurious lifestyle.</p>
<p>As the inexorable Asian labor monster invaded the shoe industry her husband lost his job. The entire industry shrunk and he was unable to find work.   She became the sole wage earner under a company promise that there would be no additional lay-offs.  The promise was broken and shortly her job was also moved offshore.   They lost everything: their home, their car, and their ability to support two children.  Without prospects of employment in Maine they moved to Florida where they are now working at dramatically lower incomes.  They have re-established their family and, though far less affluent, are again living an orderly life.  Since many employees of Maine factories are still struggling, they consider themselves fortunate.</p>
<p>Their story can be multiplied hundreds-of -thousands of times as industry after industry has been devastated by the planned economic reorganization of the world.</p>
<p>Maine is one of a number of areas that have been severely affected.  The Northeast quadrant has been hardest hit with factory closings and the accompanying disruption of the social order.  Some attempt to cite automation as a culprit but automation provides a social benefit while wholesale robbery is a devastating crime.</p>
<p>The current economic disaster was preceded by an earlier mini-disaster when the Japanese were given free access to our markets.  Now, Asians in several countries have entered the fray and despite efforts by the compliant media to cover it up debilitating disruption is clearly evident.</p>
<p>Since 1950 into the first decade of the Twenty-First Century Detroit, Michigan has lost over 61 percent of its population, Gary, Indiana 55 percent, Youngstown, Ohio over 60, Flint, Michigan over 43, Cleveland, Ohio over 56, Dayton, Ohio over 46,  Canton, Ohio over 37, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania over 54.  Though it is growing in income Chicago has still lost over 25 percent of its population.</p>
<p>The kettle holding the United States population was put over very low heat in the 1950s.  The drum beat of women’s liberation began and continued relentlessly until after several decades single income homes became archaic being replaced by a household income that included two working adults.  This malicious manipulation was imposed without adequate confrontation.</p>
<p>Then we began to hear about the competitive nature of the American work force and how they could successfully compete in the new world market.  Soon the Japanese had usurped a major percentage of the automotive industry forcing the irascibly persuasive Lee Iacocca to shame the congress into loaning Chrysler enough money to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>But the bloody Japanese axe that struck the auto industry was only the beginning.  The Chinese horde soon followed and suddenly every “Made in USA” product disappeared from our stores.  Faced with labor costs a fraction of U. S. standards, industry after industry moved manufacturing to Asia.</p>
<p>The competition was not over the ability of American workers to produce goods as efficiently as Asian labor, as it had been framed.  It was instead over the standard of living Americans had enjoyed compared to the standard of living of Chinese peasants.  As the Twenty-First Century arrived, a multitude of Americans were like the family from Maine working in retail, health-care or fast food for wages of half or less than their previous employment.</p>
<p>Current propaganda tells us our economy is improving and new jobs are being created.  It is all propaganda; don’t believe it!   In the new world order competition will force labor costs to parity and parity is lower still.</p>
<p>Though they have prepared for an uprising the powers behind centralization want to maintain peace as long as they can continue extending world domination.  The media, a propaganda arm of world government, will continue to report improvement as long as people can be convinced.</p>
<p>Human efforts are useless in stopping this onslaught.  The battle is between Christianity and paganism.  The only effective weapon against paganism is the God of the Bible and His Law.</p>
<p>Rousas Rushdoony explains, “When men forsake God, they forsake all truth, because for them there is no difference between good and evil, nor between truth and lies”.  “Numbers” Pg.316</p>
<p>The Bible, Old and New Testament, Law and Grace, comprise the full gospel.  The full gospel would have stopped tyranny in its infancy, but we have forsaken the full gospel and replaced it with the “creative word” of men.   I received an email today from my kid sister entitled “What a Church Service”; a video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=FcLF5wopyjo" target="_blank"><span title="http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=FcLF5wopyjo CTRL + Click to follow link">Andre Rieu leading a musical worship service</span></a> for a large congregation. Beautiful it is, but an appropriate church service it is not.  It is a secular multicultural extravaganza with beautiful music.</p>
<p>Christians who seek to be entertained with music and praise and do not have ears to hear what God requires of His people are useless in stopping the advance of Satan.  It is truth and justice and the seating of King Jesus at the throne of power that should be the objective of every Christian congregation.  Lies, fantasy, and all the manipulations of arrogant men should be confronted from our pulpits and by our congregations.  It is our Christian duty to counter the evil establishment bringing their wrath against the power of the Church of Jesus Christ.  When the Christian religion fails to create wrath in God’s enemies there is a serious problem in the Christian religion.</p>
<p>We are being overrun by the minions of evil.  We should be fighting a war.  We need preachers whose intrepid denouncements will inspire us to enter the battle on the side of the God of the Bible.</p>
<p>The enemy controls our television stations, our newspapers, our government, and, sadly, most of our churches.  The voices of dissent are few.  Wake up Christians and hear the call to battle!</p>
<p>When a newspaper erroneously contends our economy is improving our pulpits must present Christians with the statistics that prove otherwise.  Christians are truth-tellers!  When the Media promotes homosexuality our pulpits must denounce it with God’s Words from the Bible.  Christian duty requires that we confront evil.</p>
<p>Muslims are busy fighting for control of the Middle East.  They appear to be overcoming the secular tyrants.  Islam is a false religion and an enemy to Christianity but it is not the core danger to world freedom. In that battle Islam is an ally against the wicked forces of the new world order.</p>
<p>It is time to stop playing church.  It is time for every Christian minister to disregard reputation and directly confront the secular forces that threaten peace and order God intends for His creation.</p>
<p>Churches that concentrate on the end times, on tongues and prophecy, evangelism, or on being theologically reformed should forsake their niche religions and confront the secular minions with the full gospel.  The size of a church or its growth is of no importance; what is important is its strength against the forces of evil.  Reputations must be sacrificed; our God and King is being threatened and we are His soldiers.  It is our duty to fight for the elevation of His government– both civilians and rulers are subject to the rule of King Jesus.</p>
<p>As Patty and I exited a restaurant in Destin late in the afternoon on Christmas day we noticed a table of 8 young men with their heads bowed.  We thought it wonderful that all these young people were honoring the One True God.  However, on second look they were honoring the IPhone god instead.</p>

</div>
<p>Most predictions about the future are risky attempts at guessing. If one is fortunate, they come across a clairvoyant, who has a long established record of forecasting political prospects. In the long tradition of prognostication, by the one and only, Nostradamus, Jr., William B. Kaliher presents his 2014 prophecy. The yearly feature on the <a href="http://etherzone.com/cgi-bin/search/search.pl?Terms=%22William+Kaliher%22&amp;I1.x=22&amp;I1.y=8&amp;sort-method=3">EtherZone</a> site produced a loyal following of eager future deprived junkies. Taking pleasure in continuing this esteem exercise in sarcasm, Stuck on Stupid offers commentary on a sample of these mystic omens, which can be found on <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/010114.html">&#8220;Nostradamus, Jr.&#8221; Kaliher’s Annual Top 101 Predictions for 2014</a></p>
<p><em>10. A new danger this year will be Progressive heads unexpectedly exploding. Study of the syndrome will reveal after mistakenly reading a reputable publication, damaged and unused synapses in Progressives will heal sufficiently to realize even after six years imitating a president, Obama&#8217;s resume and accomplishments still don&#8217;t measure up to superwoman Sarah Palin.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Obama reaches out to Gore to fund his retirement and provide the ex-VP with protection.</p></blockquote>
<p>This list was selected as the tame examples. If you are daring, read the <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/010114.html">entire 101 items.</a> A serious analysis and critical review of politics is mostly ignored by the general public. The popular culture is made up of people who cannot learn, of fools who repeat their mistakes time and again, and persons who constantly screw up.</p>
<p>The art in satire varies with the source and even more with the audience. Mr. Kaliher’s perspective may seem twisted to an apologist for the establishment. It might seem downright hostile to the statist, who places trust in government. However, the continual absurdity, year after year, just grows.</p>
<p>Both in the irony of the illustrations and in the intensity of the deranged circumstances, what comes out of the political class of illusionists, is even more frightening. Truth is stranger than fiction. Yet the refusal to admit the con game that is played on citizens is the primary reason that it never ends.</p>
<p>Accepting a corrupt system as normal or inevitable is defeatist to the core. Each generation of public officials move closer to act as irrelevant puppets and lap dog administers for the dictates of perverted elites. Is there humor in this act or is it beyond the abilities of the system to provide a correcting mechanism to reverse the unwavering descent into the ridiculous.</p>
<p>So what are the reasonable expectations for 2014? Will the Republicans take the Senate? Will an amnesty immigration bill pass? Or will the administration find a magic medicine to cure Obamacare? The score card usually misses the final outcome of the game.</p>
<p>When drawn together, all the Nostradamus, Jr. Predictions for the last ten years, the picture seems far more enlightening than entertaining. The sorry state of affairs, when considered as a continual trend towards a loss in quality of life, is the only conclusion possible. Only a lazy meathead refuses to face the facts and adjust behavior when the seer speaks.</p>

			<p><em>“You’re not supposed to be so blind with patriotism that you cannot face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who does it or says It.”</em> – Malcolm X</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/corporateobama3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>I have been reading political commentary on <a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/">Black Agenda Report</a> (BAR) regularly of late. The site, which purveys a black leftist perspective, regularly excoriates President Obama, as well they should. BAR has become a trusted source in my quest to understand history and current events. This is the home of the real left, not the pseudo left that pervades the corporate airwaves masquerading as champions of equality. Here, no one is paying homage to Obama or calling him a liberal or progressive simply because he is a black democrat. No one is calling him a socialist, either. The political commentators at BAR hold Obama to the same standard to which they held George W. Bush and his fascist predecessors.</p>
<p align="left">Most of the self-proclaimed liberals who castigated Bush and Cheney for their neoconservative polices are giving Obama, whose polices are no less regressive or extreme than those of his precursors, a free ride. This is because the president belongs to the Democratic Party, which continues to be associated with traditional liberalism in the minds of contemporary faux progressives and liberals, rather than the neoliberalism that defines its policies.</p>
<p align="left">Those who continue to support Obama and his backsliding pro-corporate regime obviously have no conception about what classical liberalism and progressivism are. They are at least half a century behind the times.</p>
<p align="left">Although I may lack the political acumen to concisely define terms such as liberalism, progressivism, and leftist, which are somewhat subjective anyway, it is apparent to me that neoliberalism, the form of liberalism that is actually practiced by today’s Democratic Party, bears much in common with the neoconservatism that is associated with contemporary Republicans. There is nothing progressive about either ideology, and nothing in them that is beneficial to workers. To call Obama a liberal or a socialist, as so many people do, is beyond farcical. It strains one’s credulity to the breaking point.</p>
<p align="left">I distrust Barack Obama for the same reasons that I spurn George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, the Clintons, and any other war mongering capitalist. My criticism has nothing to do with race or gender. It stems from ideological differences, class conflict, and radically dissimilar values from the ruling clique.</p>
<p align="left">Among some black folk, charges of racism are leveled against any white folks who criticize the black president in the same way that charges of anti-Semitism are used against anyone who is critical of Israel’s Zionist polices of apartheid that, with the aid of the U.S., are being carried out against the Palestinians. This is not to deny the racism that is directed against the president. It is to philosophically and morally disassociate myself from any and all groups of white supremacists engaged in bigotry.</p>
<p align="left">If a policy is morally reprehensible and unjust, just people have a moral obligation to criticize it, regardless of who is responsible for formulating and enacting such policies. Every socially conscious human being has an ethical responsibility to take action against criminal government or any corporation that is harming one’s community, or for that matter, the planet.</p>
<p align="left">From my perspective, BAR and WPFW’s Jared Ball are ethically consistent and accurate in their critiques of Barack Obama and American capitalism. These venerable warriors are true leftists who do not compromise their principles for political expediency, cost them what it may.</p>
<p align="left">The virtually defunct radical left was once a formidable and organized political force in the U.S. Today’s leftists are treated like pariahs by the pseudo left and its neocon brethren. Radical leftists pose a viable threat to the established orthodoxy. Anyone who refuses to carry forth the performative role assigned to them by the dominant culture is a threat to those in power. As true combatants for justice, today’s leftwing dissidents are worthy of being associated with iconic revolutionaries like Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, and Mumia Abu Jamal, all of whom happen to be black.</p>
<p align="left">By contrast, Barack Obama, who mouths an endless stream of pseudo liberal platitudes, is an unabashed disciple of Milton Friedman and the market fundamentalism he revered. This identifies the president as a corporate fascist and thus a promoter of inequality. It allies him with America’s ruling class. Obama and his supporters should not be identified in any way, shape or form with thereal left. Whatever minutia one uses to differentiate between contemporary neoliberals and neoconservatives is akin to splitting hairs.</p>
<p align="left">The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are not mortal enemies, as portrayed in the corporate media; they are in collusion against the world’s working class and the poor. Together, they are raping and pillaging the Earth Mother and repressing workers through economic violence and imposed austerity. Like costumed wrestlers performing on television, the acrimony is not real; it is vitriolic political theater, an enthralling puppet show for diehard believers.</p>
<p align="left">We must somehow move beyond party politics, beyond the simplicity of liberal versus conservative dichotomy, beyond left against right, and see things as they really are rather than as we wish them to be.</p>
<p align="left">Voting doesn’t change anything in a system flush with corporate money. The structures that put the money into politics cannot be used to extract it. Without proportional representation or corporate money, third parties are not a viable option in state and federal elections. They are just another distraction from reality, a mild form of symbolic protest. Voting for justice does nothing to actually attain it. Direct action directly applied to a problem offers the best hope for revolutionary change.</p>
<p align="left">Conversely, political dualism keeps us fighting the wrong people. It has us believing in people and institutions that do not promote justice and do us harm. These institutions are not what they purport to be. They are at best a mirage; something that appears real but only exists in the mind of the beholder.</p>
<p align="left">Belief in the American Dream and perverted systems of power as a means to justice provides a method for directing and cajoling the masses to do the biding of the super-wealthy and all-powerful corporate state. Faith, hope, and belief in phony people and bogus institutions function as a form of mass hypnosis that keeps the people from organizing in class struggle against a common oppressor—the capitalist system.</p>
<p align="left">Despite reams of contradictory historical evidence, most people in the U.S. continue to associate democracy with capitalism. It is reckless of us to allow anyone to use these terms interchangeably without contesting them at every opportunity. Let me be clear: Democracy is the antithesis of capitalism! But capitalism is the product the U.S. government, the Pentagon, and the commercial media are marketing to us as democracy. And thus the inequality gap, the disparity between rich and poor, is growing wider rather than shrinking.</p>
<p align="left">The nemesis of all working people, regardless of where they live or their political affiliation, is capitalism and its linear, hierarchal, male-dominated power structures. This is why we must have a truthful critique of capitalism and patriarchy and create alternatives that promote the public wellbeing above corporate profits. Many promising alternatives, such as Professor Richard Wolff’s Worker Self-Directed Enterprise (<a href="http://www.democracyatwork.info/">http://www.democracyatwork.info</a>), already exist.</p>
<p align="left">When the richest and most powerful people on earth, the primary beneficiaries of capitalism, invest so many resources into demonizing and subverting the writings of one man—Karl Marx—and the various economic and philosophic alternatives to capitalism, inquisitive minds want to know why. There are elements of Marxism that makes the power elite quake in their shoes. This is what led me to read Marx years ago. I have been reading him ever since.</p>
<p align="left">Marx has helped me to comprehend why capitalists fear and loathe him. Deep down, they know that he was right. If workers understood capitalism from a Marxist perspective, not one in ten thousand would voluntarily accept their performative role in this exploitative economic system. There would be widespread conflict and social upheaval. There would be global revolution. The power elite spends trillions of dollars to maintain the façade of capitalism as a manifestation of democracy. In fact, I would argue that nothing could be more opposed to democracy than American capitalism.</p>
<p align="left">The key point to understand is that capitalism, a system based upon the ruthless exploitation and commodification of workers and the relentless rape of our Earth Mother, stifles and represses democracy. Capitalists abhor all forms of egalitarianism. Marx embraced them. The mere possibility of an empowered work force troubles the capitalist’s sleep, as did the possibility of slave rebellion, albeit it small, distress the slaveholder.</p>
<p align="left">Consider the vitriol, not to mention counter revolutionary forces that are levied against the alternatives to capitalism. What is their source? Who but wealthy capitalists fund America’s propaganda apparatus? Working people in the U.S. are conditioned to reflexively recoil against ideas they do not understand. They are psychologically programmed to detest that which could potentially set them free. American workers are led to believe that economic servitude and wage slavery is freedom.</p>
<p align="left">Why does a government that calls itself a democracy systemically spy on its citizens? Why does it punish its whistle blowers but materially reward the vilest white-collar criminals? Why is the majority of the U.S. budget spent on funding an insatiable war machine? Why do we raise classrooms of meat puppets rather than critical thinkers and political dissidents? It is all done for the benefit of capitalists at the expense of society.</p>
<p align="left">It is by these means that capitalism survives and spreads like an aggressive malignancy to every organ of the planet. Furthermore, the majority of the wealth produced by labor is subverted to prop up the capitalist system and to indoctrinate and oppress the worker. To the detriment of us all, freethinking and critical analysis are discouraged and often reprimanded in academia and elsewhere. And thus hundreds of millions of human beings are transformed into herd animals that are led to slaughter in the military and the world’s sweat shops. We celebrate our freedom and patriotism on our march to the scalding pots, singing “God Bless America.” There is no fight in us. We go too quietly and too obediently into the good night of eternity.</p>
<p align="left">Yet, despite everything and the repressive weight of history, Americans still have a propensity to believe in myths and fairy tales. Hope and faith in phony leaders and bogus institutions keep us servile and docile. Irrational faith requires nothing from us. Delusion has become the norm because too many of us are incapable of grappling with reality. We can and must do better than capitalism or we are doomed to an ignominious fate.</p>

<p>In his book “Truth and Transformation” Indian Christian Vishal Mangalwadi tells of the yearly journey to the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGanges&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbBeijXB5FPuDZw0X2TFxHQ74Ckw" target="_blank">Ganges River</a> by thousands of low class Hindus.  Every year the priests rob them of their money and treat them despitefully.  In spite of the harsh treatment they continue to return each year.  They return because they believe the Ganges River has healing qualities.  Belief, even irrational belief, is powerful and difficult to correct</p>
<p>Freedom for the masses was a product of particular Christianity.  It was not created by Biblically based <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FExpository_preaching&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFn77V2ltCI_BDHskw8FP8dh6xeWw" target="_blank"><span title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expository_preaching CTRL + Click to follow link">expository preaching</span></a>.  Nothing wrong with expository preaching but it will not maintain or retrieve freedom.  It cannot be produced through evangelism or through electing Christian men and women to public office.  It is not a product of obedience to the Constitution or of the election of political parties.</p>
<p>World history overflows with exploitation of the masses by individuals with superior power.  Karl <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKarl_Marx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGifSgR_-Bu2FAZG4zNF8vaKlGUCQ" target="_blank">Marx</a> wrote famously and extensively about the perennial class struggle in the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Communist_Manifesto&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFOdZN9o2O3HuhDncgRUP5ORH5kNA" target="_blank">Communist</a> Manifesto.  He was right about the struggle but hopelessly wrong about the solution.</p>
<p>I am not a theologian but I have been writing about the condition of Christianity for over a decade.  It is not only a tragedy for Christians but an affront to the triune God of All Creation that His world has become a humanistic cesspool.</p>
<p>Apathy is rampant in the United States of America.  Many of our citizens feel helpless.  They do not know how to fight the evil juggernaut.  Some believe they should enjoy themselves today because tomorrow they may die; they use our fleeting freedom selfishly.  Others like the political game and stubbornly work to get promising candidates elected.  Some buy guns and accumulate food in order to survive the coming chaos.  A few wealthy citizens spend millions of dollars constructing underground homes that could sustain them in luxury for long periods.  Millions of Evangelical Christians actually support the destruction of our nation with hope that Jesus will come again soon.  Like the Hindus belief in the Ganges, with feckless abandon they follow a false doctrine.</p>
<p>We are living in an era built on a foundation of scurrilous mendacity.  While our church leaders work to convert pagans into organizations that are both heretical and useless, our news is both censored and distorted, our entertainment supports evil practices, and our elected representatives conduct their affairs on false premises with devious intent. All of this has come about because we have allowed sinful human beings to accumulate unaccountable power.</p>
<p>I have been a Christian for over fifty years.  When God rescued me I hoped that our society would be changed by the Charismatic revival I was born into.  Early on, I thought that the love Christians showed for each other might attract secular society and that our institutions would be transformed by the Love of God.  I expected good fruit.  This hope was shattered when Christians claimed to love God but acted no different than their secular neighbors.  Leadership was emphasized and competition for advancement was fierce.  Feelings were hurt, people left and churches split.  God’s shepherds seemed to care more for the size of their church and the number of their followers than for the redeeming power of God’s love. Sermons were designed to attract members by promising “growth” and “blessing”.  Like the story that Nero fiddled while Rome was burning, Christian Churches entertained their people with healing, tongues, and emotional music while America was being destroyed.</p>
<p>Much of this tragic lethargy was a result of a widespread conviction that the Second Coming of Christ was imminent.  The Biblical warning that no one can know the time was ignored and many leaders agreed He was “coming soon” and some actually predicted exact dates.  This disobedient foolishness marred the reputation of the Church and replaced the confrontation that might have turned the secular tide. The excitement helped grow some churches but it created slovenly Christians and heretical churches.</p>
<p>Now, more than a decade into the Twenty First Century, Our Savior has tarried, our nation is corrupt, and we are on the verge of tyranny.  The voice of concern can be heard but Christians have strayed so far from the Truth that remedies evade them.</p>
<p>A secular war is being waged against Christianity and the secular army is winning.  Make no mistake it is a religious war and the time has come for Christians to wake up and begin to use the weapons God has provided.</p>
<p>Christians are called to live under a different government.  We have a King, his name is Jesus.  He was crowned King by His Father and given the responsibility to reign over the world. Christians will begin to fight in the battle for control of the world when they bow before their King and obey his Commandments.  Let me repeat: Freedom will not be produced by Biblically based expository preaching nor will it come through evangelism or through electing Christian men and women to public office.  It is not a product of obedience to the Constitution or of the election of particular political parties!  Freedom is a product of the Kingship of Jesus and obedience to His Commandments.</p>
<p>King Jesus contends with the deification of humanity.  Human rule is despotic because all human beings are sinners.  They are incapable of bringing consistent righteousness to leadership.  Leaders who fail to work under the legal standards of the Bible will eventually produce oppressive government.  Freedom comes from obedience to God’s Law by both rulers and ruled.</p>
<p>Kingless Christianity produces no challenge to rampant humanism.  When humanists enthrone man as king, Dispensational Christians are theologically without remedy and man’s dominion continues to grow.  When man’s dominion is challenged by King Jesus and His Law Word, order, peace, prosperity, and blessing present a challenge to the disorder, war, poverty, and fear of secular humanistic tyranny.</p>
<p>The hour is late and the task is difficult.  American churches are not used to seeing themselves as servants to King Jesus and proponents of God’s Law.  Church entertainment must be replaced by preaching on obedience and sacrifice.  Christians must begin to serve their King as soldiers in the war against evil.</p>
<p>Guns are useful in protecting ones family but they are useless in the battle for dominion.  The later conflict is spiritual and the model is Jesus and the blood of the Saints who have previously sacrificed their lives that the Gospel might grow and flourish.</p>
<p>My wife Patty and I thank God for each peaceful day.  We thank Him that we are living in a nation that still enjoys the embers of Christian peace and freedom.  Sunday mornings are tranquil.  Traffic is light and there is a noticeable calm.  The Sabbath of the God of the Bible is the source of that calm.</p>
<p>Americans are a generous people.  They are willing to sacrifice their wealth and their time to help those less fortunate.  Altruism is a result of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  There are still honest people in our nation.  Lost wallets are still returned with money left in them – not always but often.  Honesty is an ember of Christianity.</p>
<p>In the United States of America we have grown up in a culture that is kind and thoughtful.   Often we have not realized that this gentleness is a result of the Christian religion.  In spite of many useless wars Western civilization has maintained a conscience that can occasionally define evil.</p>
<p>Today we are watching the rapid disappearance of gentility.  Torture has become acceptable in high circles of our government.  Murder and theft have become regular fare on our television screen.  Chivalry is long gone and many women seek to overpower men.  Our policemen have become tyrannical bullies who regularly beat citizens into submission.  While our armies murder millions of innocent civilians abroad, at home we murder millions of our children by abortion.  Instead of respecting and caring for our elderly government panels will soon decide when they should die.  Actions that were unspeakable in more refined times are now accepted and promoted.  Shame has become anachronistic!</p>
<p>It is the duty of our churches to confront evil.  Like John the Baptist, the confrontation must be specific and personal.  Righteousness is not a product of physical force but of spiritual victory.  That victory required the life of our Savior and the lives of millions of saints who died so the Gospel might be sustained into our time.  We must be willing to make the same sacrifice.</p>
<p>The blessed event of the Second Coming must be left to God.  We are in the midst of a war and it is time to fight.   Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father and judges the world.  He is the King and we are His subjects.  King Jesus is our Commander.   Christians live in a different nation with a different ruler.  We live by His law and seek to bring the world under His Kingship.   Our duty is to preserve the pure Christian Gospel in its best historic form.</p>
<p>Evangelism is not the complete Gospel of Jesus Christ nor is praise and the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.  The Gospel of Jesus Christ is life changing, society changing, and world changing.  It is spiritual but it is also governmental.  King Jesus rules over His creation and His people obey His commandments.  Only when His rule is established will peace and prosperity return to the world.</p>
<p>The freedom we have enjoyed in the United States of America is a product of Christian insistence that both rulers and ruled must live and act according to the Law of God.  Samuel <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSamuel_Rutherford&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFszsHOvbiwDHJ1tweool68NPTrfg" target="_blank">Rutherford</a>  wrote Lex Rex (The Law is King).  He was condemned to death for challenging the divine rule of kings but died before he was indicted.  God’s Law is King.  His Law requires our obedience.  When an evil nation encodes evil law, God’s people must disobey that law.</p>
<p>The entire world is now in danger of coming under the humanistic rule of powerful, ambitious men.  It is the duty of The Church of Jesus Christ to challenge their authority.  God seeks Christian leaders who are willing to lay down their lives in the battle.</p>
<p>We need a new Christian church that understands the nature of the battle and is willing to commit itself to victory.  A church properly ordered cannot lose for God is on our side!</p>
<p>“This century has seen the moral paralysis of men and nations.  The crisis will not go away automatically; no historical pendulum swings men and nations back to health when they are wilfully committing suicide.  The crisis deepens daily, and the popular solutions are more and more ridiculous and inane.  We have bought disaster; we will have nothing unless we turn to God’s law and way.”  R. J. Rushdoony, “Numbers” Pg 214</p>

				<p>December 20, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19462#comments" title="Comment on Homosexual Mafia Gets Duck Dy-Nasty"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="19462 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19462">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>When I saw the headline yesterday about how “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson had commented on a certain sexuality-defined group, I wondered how long it would be before he got the “treatment.”</p>
<p>I saw the <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/duck-dynastys-phil-robertson-indefinite-666808">next headline</a> no more than a few hours later.</p>
<p>In case you haven’t heard, the faith-filled Louisianan wound up in hot water after being asked what was sinful by a <i>GQ</i> interviewer and offering the following answer, as <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/television/201401/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson?currentPage=2">presented</a> by the magazine:</p>
<p>“Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,” he says. Then he paraphrases Corinthians: “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers — they won’t inherit the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>Can you guess which of the above groups caused what subsequently befell Robertson: suspension from his <i>A&amp;E</i> show?</p>
<p>It wasn’t the greedy.</p>
<p>Or the idolaters.</p>
<p>It wasn’t bestialists, though there’s an <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100108943/the-gay-rights-movement-has-emboldened-americas-bestiality-advocates/">effort</a> to legitimize their behavior now, too.</p>
<p>The swindlers?</p>
<p>Nope — not the slanderers, either.</p>
<p>Hint: One of the organizations whose complaints got Robertson suspended was GLAAD, and that doesn’t stand for Guiding Light Advocates for Adulterers and Drunkards.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know the answer. GLAAD characterized Robertson’s comments as vile and “extreme,” and now he joins Dr. Laura Schlessinger and others whose careers were hobbled by the Velvet Mafia.</p>
<p>This is probably where I’m expected to ask, “Where’s freedom of speech?” or whine about how the left should respect the other side’s beliefs. But this would ignore reality, which is that every civilization has its “values.” And as someone once pointed out, stigmas are the corollaries of values; if we’re going to value certain things, it follows that what contradicts or condemns them will be de-valued.</p>
<p>People who don’t understand this will utter refrains such as “I don’t care what you do in your private life, just don’t shove it in my face,” as if something can be completely de-stigmatized but then, somehow, remain in the closet. Those who do grasp it, however, might say something such as what homosexual activists Hunter Madsen and Marshall Kirk wrote in their book <em>After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the 90’s</em><em>. They said that once homosexuality was normalized, </em>those who would “still feel compelled” to oppose it would be “cow[ed] and silence[d]…as far as possible” and that if homosexual activists can “produce a major realignment solidly in favour of gay rights, the intransigents (like the racists of twenty years ago) will eventually be effectively silenced by both law and polite society.” And what do we see 20 years later? Criticism of homosexuality will get overseas Westerners punished through law and Americans punished through social pressure.</p>
<p>How’s that tolerance workin’ for ya’?</p>
<p>“Tolerance,” as it has been marketed, was always a con. Aristotle said that “[t]olerance is the last virtue of a dying society,” but it’s also the vice that kills it. And it so often is a vice because it’s generally misunderstood. For one thing, tolerance <i>always</i> implies a negative, real or perceived; you wouldn’t have to tolerate a beautiful car or a delectable meal — you relish those things. But you might have to tolerate a cold or bad weather. Thus, tolerance is only noble in two situations: One is when dealing with something objectively negative that cannot be eliminated, such as irremediable pain. The other is when confronted with something you don’t happen to like and could avoid, but that is objectively good or neutral; an example would be tolerating a food you detest in order to avoid offending your hosts.</p>
<p>So while we might admire a person who can bear a cross with a stiff upper lip, what if he abides a negative he needn’t put up with? He then is either a doormat or a masochist.</p>
<p>That’s us.</p>
<p>The doormat, that is.</p>
<p>This brings us back to that modernistic “I don’t care…just don’t shove it in my face” attitude. This is a pipe dream and the first step toward degradation and tyranny; it is a false Americanism. As John Wesley said, “What one generation tolerates, the next generation will embrace.” And once this happens it is ridiculous to wonder why the thing in question is out of the closet; accepted things by definition always will be. At this point those with an affinity for it will take the next step: marketing.</p>
<p>This is precisely what Madsen and Kirk prescribed with respect to homosexuality, writing that Americans needed to be desensitized to the behavior via a “continuous flood of gay-related <em>advertising</em>,” a “conversion of the average American’s emotions, mind, and will, through a planned psychological attack, in the form of propaganda fed to the nation via the media.” Madsen, mind you, was a marketing man by trade.</p>
<p>And when this marketing is successful enough and the newly exalted product is considered a <i>good</i>, what will that which condemns it be considered? This is how good becomes bad, bad becomes good, and those conned into being tolerant come to be seen as intolerable (I discuss this in-depth <a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2013/06/the-acceptance-con.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>And thus is Christianity being suppressed. Make no mistake, the concept of sin is central to Christianity — and sexual sin is part of that centrality. Lust, correctly defined as disordered sexual desire, is one of the Seven Deadly Sins. So saying you cannot talk about sexual sin — in its entirety — is to say you cannot talk about Christianity in its entirety. And this is part of the process of relegating Christianity to the closet.</p>
<p>This tolerance trap is why Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen <a href="http://www.northamericanmartyrs.org/pdf/Plea-for-Intolerance.pdf">wrote</a> in 1931:</p>
<p>America, it is said, is suffering from intolerance — it is not. It is suffering from tolerance. Tolerance of right and wrong, truth and error, virtue and evil, Christ and chaos. Our country is not nearly so overrun with the bigoted as it is overrun with the broadminded.</p>
<p>…Tolerance is an attitude of reasoned patience toward evil, and a forbearance that restrains us from showing anger or inflicting punishment. …Architects are as intolerant about sand as foundations for skyscrapers as doctors are intolerant about germs in their laboratories….</p>
<p>Tolerance does not apply to truth or principles. About these things we must be intolerant, and for this kind of intolerance, so much needed to rouse us from sentimental gush, I make a plea. Intolerance of this kind is the foundation of all stability.<i></i></p>
<p>Our culture war is a fight to the death. The barbarians are inside the gate, and they don’t listen to reason. Show them the same tolerance they show you — and then show them the door. In the case of <i>A&amp;E</i>, what should happen is that they be boycotted till brought to their knees.</p>
<p><i>To their knees</i>.</p>
<p>Unless we can rediscover virtue and muster total intolerance for the intolerable, our decline will be inexorable.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Men (people) are rarely aware of the real reasons which motivate their actions.” </strong>— Edward Bernays, Propaganda, 1928</em></p>
<p>The winter holidays are traditionally supposed to embody a certain ideal of that which is best in the hearts of human beings. As the world around us retreats into ice and snow and the Earth’s northern cycle returns to death once again, the holidays represent a time of contemplation, as well as an opportunity to shine a light in an otherwise dark and dreary period. This heritage is as old as history, dating back to an era in which agriculture was paramount and men garnered far more respect for the tides of nature. The parallel relationship between social “renewal” and seasonal renewal has served the collective psyche of Western society, in my view, for the better. Unfortunately, this process has all but vanished today, twisted and mutilated into something sinister and poisonous.</p>
<p>Those of us who pay attention are well aware of a trend of cultural decline within our nation, and this problem is disturbingly visible from Thanksgiving to Christmas. It’s not just the highly publicized Black Friday (now Black Thursday) riots over semi-cheap Chinese-made garbage. Those are certainly vile examples:</p>
<p>Rather, it’s the behavior of people throughout the season on a daily basis that is most disconcerting. I have personally witnessed, as I’m sure many people have, a magnified and astonishing disregard for conscience and basic decency growing worse each year for at least the past decade. That which is most unsettling about our society today is somehow unleashed with wild abandon every year at this time.</p>
<p>The idiocy and barbarism seems to span all economic “classes” — from the upper-middle-class snob screaming at bewildered cashiers over a coupon worth 50 cents, to the middle-class suburbanites brawling on the sticky floors of Wal-Mart over flat-screen TVs, to the part-time employee who sold her soul for minimum wage and who now yells at people on Thanksgiving eve to stop filming the mindless brawls that her corporate masters encourage because such videos might “reflect badly” on the company image. The dark side truly knows no social or financial bounds.</p>
<p>Every year, we see this behavior, shake our heads in dismay and look forward to the beginning of January, when Americans go back to being only moderately disdainful toward each other. This time, however, instead of merely gawking in disbelief at the circus sideshow, I would like to challenge people to explore more deeply the true motivations of the mob itself, as well as the motivations of the elitists who manipulate the mob for their own purposes. Let’s take a look at the fundamental dynamics of the psychology of mobs and the madness of crowds.</p>
<p><strong>Filling The Emptiness</strong></p>
<p>In my recent article &#8216;<a href="http://personalliberty.com/2013/11/19/you-should-feel-sorry-for-sheeple-heres-why/"><em>You Should Feel Sorry For Sheeple; Here’s Why&#8217;</em></a>, I outline the inner life, or rather the lack of inner life, common to the average sheeple. Many of my compatriots find it increasingly difficult to muster any pity for the sheeple subculture, and I can see why. When given ample opportunity, sheeple always sink toward the worst humanity has to offer usually in an effort to aggrandize themselves.</p>
<p>But let’s set aside that sick feeling in our stomachs when thinking of sheeple and really consider what their existence is like. What does a sheeple’s daily life consist of?</p>
<p>In most cases I&#8217;ve observed, he lives what he believes to be the American dream. He wakes up in the morning swelling with superficial concerns of personal gain, scheming ways in which he can raise his perceived stature among the other sheeple around him. He then then travels to his place of employment, usually a job he hates, in order to accumulate enough wealth (scraps from the plates of government and corporate financiers) to buy all the “things” he assumes everyone else wants. In the process, he pawns off his children to state-run schools designed to crush their spirits; and he becomes estranged from his spouse, who begins to forget why they ever got married in the first place. He returns home physically and emotionally drained, knowing that he did nothing worthwhile with his time, only to sit apathetically in front of his television for a few hours being bombarded with cancerous marketing propaganda and barely talking with the family he tells himself he works so hard for.</p>
<p>Think about it. Think of the pitch-black void that his life has become. Think of all the abandoned dreams, all the missed opportunities for experience and joy, all the moments of reflection and self-education that were missed because he was “too busy” trying to elevate himself within the ranks of a heartless collective.</p>
<p>Now, for one frightening moment, imagine this is your life. No sense of legitimate pride or individualism. No understanding of the underlying events that affect your environment or the high-placed people who determine your future. No thoughts outside the mainstream box. No recognition of possible alternative ways to live or how to break free. No hope for tomorrow but the endless drudgery of today’s mediocrity. Think of the unconscious rage you would have brewing inside like a putrid ball of sulfur and magma.</p>
<p>This rage is what sheeple use to fill the emptiness inside themselves once they subconsciously realize that no amount of frivolous consumerism will make them whole. Typically, they are on constant lookout for opportunities to vent their anger at unsuspecting victims in drive-by fashion.</p>
<p>Somehow, the holidays appear to have become a prime period of opportunity during which society opens the door for the dark side to come out and for sheeple to passively or not-so-passively project their failings onto others. For now, we might presume that this behavior is somewhat contained and relegated to particular moments of seasonal insanity, but the consequences of the willfully ignorant strata of American culture could go far beyond what most morally conscious people want to predict.</p>
<p><strong>The Psychopath Next Door</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“If thirty years ago anyone had dared to predict that our psychological development was tending towards a revival of the medieval persecutions of the Jews, that Europe would again tremble before the Roman fasces and the tramp of legions, that people would once more give the Roman salute, as two thousand years ago, and that instead of the Christian Cross an archaic swastika would lure onward millions of warriors ready for death — why, that man would have been hooted at as a mystical fool.” </strong>— Carl Jung, Archetypes And The Collective Unconscious, 1938</em></p>
<p>In his book, <a href="http://luizfernando.info/pbd/The%20Undiscovered%20Self%20-%20Carl%20Gustav%20Jung.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Undiscovered Self</em></a>, one of the fathers of modern psychology, Carl Gustav Jung, discusses the tension-filled relationship between the individual versus the collective and the state. In particular, he studies how individuals become swallowed up in the actions of the collective mob and how this momentum invariably leads to mass atrocities that defy imagination. A point of primary importance in Jung’s work is his discovery that at least 10 percent of any population at any given time is made up of individuals with latent psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies. Meaning, at least one out of every 10 random people around you today was born with the capacity for psychopathic behavior, including the ability to completely ignore inherent conscience.</p>
<p>The idea that one out of every 10 people near you might suddenly burst into an overwhelming animalistic blood fever is, of course, terrifying to many people. But generally, latent psychopathy in a person does not surface in immediately recognizable ways; and many people with that potential live their entire lives without ever acting on it. Some even come to terms with it through self-awareness and dispel it altogether. Problems arise, though, as Jung warned, when a society creates an environment in which emotionally or physically violent psychopathic acts become “acceptable” to the collective. That is to say, individual latent psychopaths and sociopaths are not so much a danger on their own; but when they get together in an organization or mob, the terrible floodgates open.</p>
<p>During national crisis, or during great ideological shifts towards collectivism, the 10 percent are given ample opportunity to act out their inner impulses. The corrupt state will often give latent psychopaths free reign or seek them out for positions of petty authority, leaving the gates to hell ajar, as it were.</p>
<p>Another dangerous reality is that these same people tend to pursue positions of authority, or they unconsciously gravitate toward events and situations that allow them to act on their darker side without facing consequences. One might even suggest that there will always be a potential for despotic regimes exactly because the 10 percent will likely always be around to be used as a weapon by dictatorships.</p>
<p>The mass rage and self-absorption we witness during the holidays feels ominous to us because it is just a glimpse of the greater shadow side of the American public. It is a glimpse of the kind of mentality that makes all human catastrophe possible. Like the tip of a shark fin cutting the surface of the water, we swim fearing not the dorsal, but the monster we KNOW it is connected to.</p>
<p><strong>The Magicians Of Manufactured Consent<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Jung, once a favorite of Sigmund Freud’s, broke sharply with Freud’s analytical school when he realized Freud would not accept the idea of inherent psychological properties beyond base instincts. Freud believed that conscience, morality, artistic ability, reason, etc. were all extensions of environment and experience. Freud’s theories on psychology focused on the idea that man was driven by base animal urges at his core, that people have no complex inborn contents and that all one needed to do was manipulate his environment to make himself “healthy.” Jung’s studies proved otherwise, finding that there are vast layers of inborn knowledge and personality in every individual.</p>
<p>It was not until Freud was near death that he admitted the merit of Jung’s work. Jung was shunned by the mainstream and labeled everything from a “charlatan” to an “anti-Semite” because of his opposition to the Freudian method.</p>
<p>Some industrious elites did find Freud’s notions of environmental manipulation useful, though, including his nephew, Edward Bernays, who saw it not as a way to make people healthy, but rather, to make them unhealthy. Bernays wrote extensively on the use of propaganda to control what he called “herd instinct,” believing (as most elitists believe) that self-governance of common people was “dangerous” and that the irrational public had to be controlled for their own good and the good of the nation. His entire philosophy is summed up in this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. … We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. … In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons… who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Bernays was instrumental in promoting Freudian psychology in the United States, where it became the mainstay of universities across the country. He helped establish the Tavistock Institute, a globalist think-tank much like the Council On Foreign Relations, focused on molding public opinion. He was also instrumental in promoting psychological propaganda models in everyday corporate marketing and political campaigns. He called this “engineering consent.”</p>
<p>It was Bernays who taught the marketing world how to appeal to the basest instincts of human beings and to use those instinctual desires to covertly control them. Corporations used Bernays’ strategies to create an atmosphere of decadent consumption in America that has lasted since the end of World War II. The idea was simple: Convince the public that buying corporate products will satisfy their animal urges. All commercialism to this day revolves around this method (which is why almost every beer commercial for several decades has included scantily clad women or sexual innuendo, for example).</p>
<p>But Bernays was not only teaching corporations how to tap into existing human impulses, he was also teaching corporations and governments how to use psychological trickery to manipulate the citizenry to RELY on their basest impulses. Essentially, Bernays taught the establishment how to convince people, or shame people, into ignoring their greater selves and indulging their psychopathic and sociopathic urges. Bernays taught the establishment how to turn people into zombies.</p>
<p>We see the clear results today all around us as we enter into the absurdity that Christmas has become. The ramifications are dire. The holidays have come to represent not hope, but despair; not reflection, but callowness; not compassion, but narcissism and selfishness. They have become a yearly measure of our Nation’s sharp fall into something more or less horrific, something ironically inhuman.</p>
<p>The only solution is to strive with everything we have to remind others, and ourselves, that we are more than the sum of our darker instincts. That we have been living in the midst of a carefully crafted lie meant to make us impotent and non-threatening to the establishment. That there are greater and more meaningful contents at our core, and these elements of our being can only be satisfied by one thing: the truth.</p>

<p>At the current rate of immigration, America faces 100 million more people from all around the world by 2050—37 scant years from now.  That equals to 20 of our most populated cities being duplicated into 20 more of them.  That means 100 million more people to water, feed, house, transport, warm and work. It means accelerated environmental devastation to our natural world. </p>
<p>That kind of demographic addition means those people face smooching, smashing and cramming into every nook and cranny of our already bursting concrete jungles, skyscrapers, walls of glass, gridlocked traffic and air-polluted cities that crush the human spirit.</p>
<p>New York City may look pretty on the television with a colorful light-filled skyline at night, but it’s not pretty in reality.  It houses 8.3 million people smashed onto subways all day long. The Big Apple faces gridlocked streets and highly toxic air pollution.  The “City that Never Sleeps” features 250 square foot</p>
<p>apartments, the size of two car parking spaces, for couples that cost a fortune.  Within 36 years, it faces from 2 to 5 million more people added to its burgeoning concrete jungles.</p>
<p>It means that every person breathing every minute of every day inhales toxic air with every breath.  New York City and all cities of enormous sizes encase people in concrete, glass and steel 24/7.  Their feet never touch the green Earth or enjoy a forest full of trees.  They never see deer, elk, eagles or fox.  Humans living in huge cities lose connection with the wilderness.  In the end, they lose connection with themselves.</p>
<p>They drink contaminated water, breathe dirty air, get lost on crowded sidewalks, and they face spiritual and emotional duress.  They also face fear from violence on the subways, alleyways and waterfronts.  Notice CSI New York, or Miami, or Los Angeles crime shows.  They showcase a lot of crazy people committing  senseless crimes to unlucky people piled on top of one another. Last month in New York City, one woman pushed a man onto the tracks of a subway train: killed him instantly.   Big cities foster the most aberrant behavior seen in humans.  The bigger the city, the more aberrant the crimes.</p>
<p>John Muir said, “Tell me what you will of the benefactions of city civilization, of the sweet security of streets—all as part of the natural up-growth of man towards the high destiny we hear so much of.  I know</p>
<p>That our bodies were made to thrive only in pure air, and the scenes in which pure air is found. If the death exhalations that brood the broad towns in which we so fondly compact ourselves were made visible, we should flee as from a plague. All are more or less sick; there is not a perfectly sane man in San Francisco.”</p>
<p>For example: along with gridlocked traffic in my area of Denver, Colorado, we house 2.5 million people.  Everyday, we suffer an average of 24 accidents on our bumper-to-bumper highways.  You could get killed going to or from work.  On weekends, trying to travel into the mountains gets you backed up for three or more hours on what used to take an hour.  Returning from a skiing or camping weekend on I-70 and most other roads exasperates everyone and ruins the weekend.  To think that mass immigration will flood Colorado with another 5, 10 and 20 million more people!   It’s nuts folks! Totally and completely crazy!</p>
<p>In Denver and most big American cities, you see bagmen, bag ladies, the lost and forgotten, homeless and drunks everywhere.  You see trash flying around the streets from all the dispossessed who toss it everywhere.  Denver’s Platte River runs with bottles, cans, plastics and junk from a never-ending source of humans that don’t care.</p>
<p>Every week in Denver, any number of people shoot, stab or run over someone.  If you go to a small city of less than 5,000, you don’t hear of a traffic accident or murder for years.</p>
<p>As we immigrate ourselves into a human pile-up, our quality of life degrades.  We who work must pay for welfare services for all those who can’t, won’t, unskilled or are unable to work.  By injecting ourselves with another 100 million immigrants from third world countries, we culturally face becoming a schizophrenic society.</p>
<p>The term “quality of life” indicates the general well-being of people and societies. A person’s environment, physical and mental health, education, recreation, social well-being, freedom, human rights and happiness also remain significant factors.</p>
<p>By adding 100 million more immigrants to this country, which guarantees our cities explode beyond human imagination—do you think the above paragraph or the American Dream can withstand the migrant onslaught?</p>
<p>One look at Chicago’s “Murder capital of America” statistics; Detroit’s welfare wasteland and thousands of burned out city blocks; Miami’s immigrant Central American underworld; Houston’s endless traffic; Denver’s 24/7 smog; Atlanta’s sweltering smoke billowing from its expressways, Los Angeles’ daily traffic-smog nightmare and track-housing packing Americans into monopoly-board-misery lacks any semblance to “Quality of Life.”</p>
<p>If we fail to stop mass legal and illegal immigration, we guarantee a miserable future for all Americans of every race, creed and color.</p>

Anyone who has studied history knows that the life of a nation as well as its citizens can turn on a dime. On November 22, 1963, the fate of the United States took a dramatic turn for the worse. On that fateful day, some very evil forces asserted their absolute control over the country. This is significant because some of these same evil forces, as well as their descendants are actively enslaving America today.</p>
<h2>John Kennedy An Unlikely President</h2>
<p>John Kennedy was never a perfect man and his exploits with many beautiful and often controversial women, such as Ingrid Arvid, Judith Exner and Marilyn Monroe speaks to JFK’s imperfections. In fact, the present day corporate controlled media has continually revealed JFK’s womanizing ways as an attempt to remove any sympathy for the slain President.</p>
<p>JFK had the dubious legacy of being born into a family of very active criminality. His father, the former ambassador to England, stock market insider trader and mafia bootlegger, Joseph Kennedy, used his underworld ties to convince Meyer Lansky as well as key members of the Chicago mafia to steal the Cook County, IL., presidential election of 1960.</p>
<p>Illinois was the ultimate swing state. If JFK had not carried Cook County, Illinois, the presidency would have fallen to Nixon. Nixon was the insider’s choice. As Vice-President, he circumvented Ike and exacerbated the crisis situation in Southeast Asia on behalf of the furtherance of the CIA’s heroin trafficking through the infamous “Golden Triangle”. Nixon was in bed with the military industrial complex as Ike called it in his farewell address. Nixon was subservient to the whims of the Federal Reserve and ran interference for them, often to the chagrin of Ike, who desperately wanted to dump Nixon from the 1956 Republican ticket. Nixon was the elite’s errand boy, however, what the elite did not count on was the dramatic impact that the combination of television and JFK’s personal charm would play in the outcome of the 1960 election.</p>
<p><img alt="nixon jfk debates" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/nixon-jfk-debates.jpg" width="251" height="201" />In the famous Nixon-Kennedy debates, which were simulcast on radio and television, Nixon actually won among radio listeners. However, among the largest audience, the television audience, JFK won hands down and history was changed. JFK’s charismatic appeal was something that the elite had underestimated. The insiders were left to deal with the son of a criminal and most likely they thought they could work with the son of the Adolph Hitler supporting and bootlegging thug.</p>
<h2>JFK Became a Changed Man</h2>
<p>When JFK entered the White House, his party ways came with him, but there would soon be a series of events that would make John Kennedy a changed man. In 1961, the CIA and director Dulles circumvented JFK by launching a secret invasion of Cuba in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. It was only at the last moment did JFK discover the unfolding events in which he refused to provide air cover and the invasion failed on the beach. Kennedy fired Dulles and threatened to break the CIA into a thousand pieces. This even marked the beginning of the bifurcation between JFK and the elite because the CIA had become their errand boy. The elite and their mafia partners desperately wanted Cuba back under their control and JFK blocked their ambitions. The following year, as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK had another chance to redeem himself in the eyes of the elite and again he failed. It did not matter that JFK had averted WWIII, he failed to put boots on the ground in Cuba and again, the elite and their designs for Cuba were thwarted.</p>
<p><img alt="vietnam protestors" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/vietnam-protestors.jpg" width="275" height="184" />Simultaneous to the events in Cuba, JFK was dragging his feet on Vietnam. He was reluctantly continuing on the path of allowing combat advisers to continue to operate in South Vietnam.</p>
<p>Vietnam was potentially a huge cash cow to the establishment elite. Chrysler Corporation received 90% of all US defense contracts in 1963, mostly in a middleman capacity. Bell Helicopter and Chase Manhattan Bank would reap record profits from the Vietnam War. Unfortunately for the elite, JFK was growing more isolationist. He became a changed man following the Cuban Missile Crisis as this event shook him to his core. He feared putting the US in military situations that could result in another confrontation with the Soviets. In 1963, JFK had announced that he was bringing home all combat advisers in 1965. JFK and South Vietnamese President, Diem, agreed that America would never send ground troops to Vietnam. Diem and his brother were assassinated by the CIA and 21 days later, JFK was dead. Nine months following these assassinations, America sent 100,000 ground troops to South Vietnam following the now discredited Gulf of Tonkin incident and the elite bathed in their blood money.</p>
<p>JFK had been so shaken by the real possibility of WWIII, that he and the Soviet Premier were actually having discussions regarding the capping of nuclear arms production. The elite could not have any part of  this unprofitable course of action. There is no money to be made in peace especially if you are Martin Marietta (today known as Martin Lockheed). The establishment elite wanted to continue down the path arming America’s nuclear arsenal to the teeth. JFK had become a major impediment to profits in this regard.</p>
<h2>The Changed Man Takes Center Stage</h2>
<p>JFK, no doubt motivated by the fear of WWIII, was blocking Vietnam and was going to kill the cash cow of nuclear arms production. No doubt, JFK saw the establishment elite as the enemy of humanity. They were willing to take the country to war so that they could fatten their wallets.</p>
<p>JFK began to take action against the elite. He was taking away half of their unwarranted oil depletion allowance. JFK stuck a big stick in the eye of the Federal Reserve by printing over $4 billion dollars of silver backed money, thus threatening the stranglehold the Federal Reserve had enjoyed over the country for the past 50 years.</p>
<p>JFK began making speeches, very damning speeches, in which he called out the establishment elite and their “secret societies” and then JFK signed his death warrant with his American University speech in which he announced, among other things, a desire to pursue peace with the Soviets. Once again, there is no money in peace.</p>
<p>On behalf of “the greater good”, JFK had to be eliminated and he was. However, I have often wondered if JFK had survived, how would America have been changed.</p>
<h2>If JFK Had Lived</h2>
<p><img alt="jfk plot" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/jfk-plot.jpg" width="285" height="177" /><br />
If JFK had lived, so too, would have 58,000 Americans and untold millions of Vietnamese. If JFK had lived, we would not have spent two trillion dollars on nuclear arms. The money could have been spent, as JFK suggested, on education. America might not have become the hopelessly dumbed down nation that it has become. If JFK had lived the Federal Reserve would have eventually gone the way of the two previous central banks in the United States. The US Congress would have retaken the constitutional power of coining money, interest free money. America would have remained solvent.</p>
<p>If JFK had lived, he would have continued to confront the oil companies and today, we might have achieved energy independence and could be paying about a buck for a gallon if gas. Alaska would be the new Middle East and the petrodollar, which threatens to plunge us into a world war over Syria and Iran, would no longer be a problem. The world would be coming to the US for its energy needs and our economy would be booming.</p>
<p>If JFK had lived, the people would have had their true representative in the White House. The events in Cuba so changed John Kennedy, that he became a true Ron Paul in the last two years of his life. It was the last time, that anyone, outside the elite establishment, had anyone in top level government that cared for them.</p>
<p>The day that John Kennedy died, November 22, 1963, was the beginning of the end for America. These same forces, the interlocking directorates of the military industrial complex, the Federal Reserve, the major oil companies and the media that they control, continued to suck the life out of America to the point of where we stand today, a shell of our former country.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If in the last year of JFK’s presidency, he hadn’t offered such hope to the American people and to the future of the country, I would have lost interest in the life of JFK and his subsequent assassination a long time ago.</p>
<p>I falsely held out the hope that the 50th Anniversary of his death would rekindle a curiosity about who killed JFK and why and then subsequently link that knowledge into today’s America. This could have been the impetus for change in America. Alas, the elite controlled the narrative this fall with plethora of documentaries which lead away from the truth that there was a conspiracy to kill JFK. As a result, the country’s interest will continue to wane and with it, the belief that JFK was killed as a result of a conspiracy.</p>
<p>In 1993, 80% of the country believed that JFK was killed as the result of a conspiracy. With the rash of media propaganda, that number has reduced to 61%. The elite have weathered the storm and continue unabated on their journey towards sucking the life out of this country. They will continue to do so until there is nothing left and we are thrown onto the junk pile of history.</p>
<p>There will be no 51st anniversary recognition as the JFK researchers have approached their twilight. Soon the JFK assassination will carry the same weight as the assassination of McKinley. Who? That’s my point. The King is dead, long live the King.</p>
<p><img alt="jfk" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/jfk.jpg" width="217" height="232" />On November 23rd, as we turn our collective eyes back on our future, we might want to begin to prepare for adaptation for there will be no great awakening because your future and your very lives are being threatened by forces that John Kennedy foresaw over 50 years ago in his “Secret Societies” speech.</p>

<p>It is often said there only two kinds of people in this world: those who know, and those who don’t. I would expand on this and say that there are actually three kinds of people: those who know, those who don’t know, and those who don’t care to know. Members of the last group are the kind of people I would characterize as “sheeple.”</p>
<p>Sheeple are members of a culture or society who are not necessarily oblivious to the reality of their surroundings; they may have been exposed to valuable truths on numerous occasions. However, when confronted with facts contrary to their conditioned viewpoint, they become aggressive and antagonistic in their behavior, seeking to dismiss and attack the truth by attacking the messenger and denying reason.  Sheeple exist on both sides of America&#8217;s false political paradigm, and they exist in all social &#8220;classes&#8221;.  In fact, the &#8220;professional class&#8221; and the hierarchy of academia are rampant breeding grounds for sheeple; who I sometimes refer to as &#8220;intellectual idiots&#8221;.  Doctors and lawyers, scientists and politicians are all just as prone to the sheeple plague as anyone else; the only difference is that they have a bureaucratic apparatus behind them which gives them a false sense of importance.  All they have to do is tow the establishment line, and promote the establishment view.</p>
<p>Of course the common argument made by sheeple is that EVERYONE thinks everyone else is blind to the truth, which in their minds, somehow vindicates their behavior.  However, the characteristic that absolutely defines a sheeple is not necessarily a lack of knowledge, but an unwillingness to consider or embrace obvious logic or truth in order to protect their egos and biases from harm.  A sheeple&#8217;s mindset is driven by self centered motives.</p>
<p>So-called mainstream media outlets go out of their way to reinforce this aggressive mindset by establishing the illusion that sheeple are the “majority” and that the majority perception (which has been constructed by the MSM) is the only correct perception.</p>
<p>Many liberty movement activists have noted recently that there has been a surge in media propaganda aimed at painting the survival, preparedness and liberty cultures as “fringe,” “reactionary,” “extremist,” “conspiracy-minded,” etc. National Geographic’s television show “Doomsday Preppers” appears to have been designed specifically to seek out the worst possible representatives of the movement and parade their failings like a carnival sideshow. Rarely do they give focus to the logical arguments regarding why their subjects become preppers, nor do they normally choose subjects who can explain as much in a coherent manner. This is a very similar tactic used by the establishment media at large-scale protests; they generally attempt to interview the least-eloquent and easiest-to-ridicule person present and make that person a momentary mascot for the entire group and the philosophy they hold dear.</p>
<p>The goal is to give sheeple comfort that they are “normal” and that anyone who steps outside the bounds of the mainstream is “abnormal” and a welcome target for the collective.</p>
<p>It would appear that the life of a sheeple is a life of relative bliss. The whole of the establishment machine seems engineered to make them happy and the rest of us miserable. But is a sheeple’s existence the ideal? Are they actually happy in their ignorance? Are they truly safe within the confines of the system? Here a just a few reasons why you should feel sorry for them.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Are Nothing Without The Collective</strong></p>
<p>A sheeple gathers his entire identity from the group. He acts the way he believes the group wants him to act. He thinks the way he believes the group wants him to think. All of his “ideas” are notions pre-approved by the mainstream. All of his arguments and talking points are positions he heard from the media, or academia, and he has never formed an original opinion in his life. Without the group telling him what to do, the average sheeple is lost and disoriented. When cast into a crisis situation requiring individual initiative, he panics or becomes apathetic, waiting for the system to come and save him rather than taking care of himself. Sheeple are so dependent on others for every aspect of their personality and their survival that when faced with disaster, they are the most likely people to curl up and die.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Crave Constant Approval From Others</strong></p>
<p>Sheeple are not only reliant on the collective for their identity and their survival; they also need a steady supplement of approval from others in order to function day to day. When a sheeple leaves his home, he is worried about how his appearance is perceived, how his attitude is perceived, how his lifestyle is perceived and how his opinions are perceived. Everything he does from the moment his day begins revolves around ensuring that the collective approves of him. Even his acts of “rebellion” are often merely approved forms of superficial “individualism” reliant on style rather than substance. This approval becomes a kind of emotional drug to which the sheeple is addicted. He will never make waves among the herd or stand out against any aspect of the herd worldview, because their approval sustains and cements his very existence. To take collective approval away from him would be like cutting off a heroin junky’s supplier. To be shunned by the group would destroy him psychologically.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Are Incapable Of Original Creativity</strong></p>
<p>Because sheeple spend most of their waking moments trying to appease the collective, they rarely, if ever, have the energy or inclination to create something of their own. Sheeple do not make astonishing works of art. They do not achieve scientific discovery. They do not make history through philosophical or ideological innovation.  Instead, they regurgitate the words of others and hijack ideas from greater minds.  They remain constant spectators in life, watching change from the bleachers, caught in the tides of time and tossed about like congealed satellites of Pacific Ocean garbage from the after-wash of Fukushima. The destiny of the common sheeple is entirely determined by the outcome of wars and restorations waged by small groups of aware individuals — some of them good, some of them evil.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Have No Passion</strong></p>
<p>If you draw all of your beliefs from what the collective deems acceptable, then it is difficult, if not impossible, to become legitimately passionate about them. Sheeple have little to no personal connection to their ideals or principles; so they become mutable, empty and uninspired. They tend to turn toward cynicism as a way to compensate, making fun of everything, especially those who ARE passionate about something. The only ideal that they will fight for is the collective itself, because who they are is so intertwined with the survival of the system. To threaten the concept of the collective is to threaten the sheeple’s existence by extension.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Are Useless</strong></p>
<p>The average sheeple does not learn how to be self-reliant because it is considered “abnormal” by the mainstream to be self-reliant. The collective and the state are the provider. They are mother and father. Sheeple have full faith that the system will protect them from any and all harm. When violence erupts, they cower and hide instead of defending themselves and others. When large-scale catastrophe strikes, they either sit idle waiting for the state to save them or they join yet another irrational mob. They do not take proactive measures, because they never felt the need to learn how.</p>
<p>Consider this: Why do the mainstream and the people subject to it care if others prepare for disaster or end their dependency on the establishment? Why are they so desperate to attack those of us who find our own path? If the system is so effective and the collective so correct in its methodology, then individualists are hurting only themselves by walking away, right? But for the sheeple, successfully self-reliant individuals become a constant reminder of their own inadequacies. They feel that if they cannot survive without the system, NO ONE can survive without the system; and they will make sure that individualists never prove otherwise. “You didn’t build that” becomes the sheeple motto, as they scratch and scrape like spoiled children, trying to dismantle the momentum of independent movements and ventures in non-participation.</p>
<p><strong>Sheeple Are Easily Forgotten</strong></p>
<p>To live a life of endless acceptance is to live a life of meaningless obscurity. When one arrives at his deathbed, does he want to reflect on all of his regrets or all of his accomplishments? Most of us would rather find joy than sadness when looking back over our past. For sheeple, though, this will not be possible — for what have they ever done besides conform? What will they have left behind except a world worse off than when they were born? What will they have accomplished, but more pain and struggle for future generations? In the end, what have their lives really been worth?</p>
<p>I cannot imagine a torture more vicious and terrifying than to realize in the face of one’s final days that one wasted his entire life trying to please the plethora of idiots around him, instead of educating them and himself and molding tomorrow for the better. I cannot imagine a punishment more severe than to spend the majority of one’s years as a slave without even knowing it. I cannot imagine an existence more deserving of pity and remorse than that of the sheeple.</p>
