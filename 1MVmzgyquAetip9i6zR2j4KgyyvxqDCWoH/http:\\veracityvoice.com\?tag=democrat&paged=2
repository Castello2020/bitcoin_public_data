<p>China is an economic powerhouse. It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s second largest economy. It&#8217;s heading for number one status.</p>
<p>Perhaps sooner than most expect. It&#8217;s growth way outdistances America. It&#8217;s multiples greater.</p>
<p>Russia matches Washington&#8217;s military might. It does so in nuclear weapons strength. With sophisticated delivery systems.</p>
<p>Able to strike global targets accurately. With hugely destructive force. Enough to decimate potential adversaries. Perhaps to discourage potential aggression.</p>
<p>Russia is rich in what China needs most. Oil and gas mainly. Technological expertise. Industrial equipment. Sophisticated weapons.</p>
<p>Each nation is significant separately. They&#8217;re able to challenge America responsibly.</p>
<p>Together they&#8217;re a powerful combination. A force for world peace. For multi-polarity. For humanity. For weakening Washington&#8217;s imperium.</p>
<p>Sino-Russian ties stress unity. They&#8217;re strategically important. They&#8217;re stronger than ever in modern times.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re deepening. They expanding. Washington is increasingly concerned. It&#8217;s going all-out to subvert what weakens its strength.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s waging political, economic and cyberwar. It&#8217;s fighting a losing battle. Sino/Russian unity is odds on to prevail.</p>
<p>Especially with committed ties. With deepening ones. With stronger than ever ones.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Putin arrived in Shanghai. It&#8217;s China&#8217;s financial capital. He came to finalize a &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; trade deal. It&#8217;s enormously important.</p>
<p>It bonds both countries more closely together. It does so politically economically, commercially and militarily.</p>
<p>Both countries will trade increasingly in their own currencies. They&#8217;ll strengthen them. They&#8217;ll bypass dollar transactions. They&#8217;ll weaken it.</p>
<p>Russia will supply China with around 38 billion cubic million meters of natural gas annually. For the next 30 years.</p>
<p>It may double in size ahead. Depending on China&#8217;s internal needs.</p>
<p>Other increased trade was agreed on. In technological, industrial, and commercial sectors. In military hardware.</p>
<p>Growing Sino-Russian trade lessens reliance on increasingly undependable Western sources. It gives them less access to their markets.</p>
<p>Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping reject irresponsible US-led Western bashing. They called sanctions political tools.</p>
<p>They condemned &#8220;encouraging and financing&#8221; Washington&#8217;s regime change agenda.</p>
<p>The President of Russia&#8217;s web site <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/news/7199">headlined</a> &#8220;Russian-Chinese talks.&#8221; Both leaders met in Shanghai.</p>
<p>They &#8220;signed a <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/transcripts/7200">Joint Declaration</a> of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the new stage of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between the two countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>They &#8220;witnessed the signing of a package of intergovernmental, interdepartmental and commercial documents on cooperation in the economy, trade, energy and the humanitarian areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>They issued a joint statement. &#8220;(A)mbitious goals&#8221; were agreed on, it said. &#8220;(L)ong-term milestones&#8221; were established.</p>
<p>&#8220;(I)mportant bilateral documents&#8221; were signed. &#8220;Relations between Russia and the People’s Republic of China are developing successfully and have reached a new level of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation,&#8221; it stressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;(S)pecial attention (was on) economic issues. China is Russia&#8217;s leading foreign trade partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Sino/Russian Investment Committee was established. Its mandate is expanding economic and financial ties.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;diversifying trade.&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;reducing…dependence on global economic&#8221; conditions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s promoting cooperation in &#8220;technology-intensive areas.&#8221; They include industrial, commercial, banking and military areas.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re increasing bilateral ruble/renminbi trade. It bears repeating. Doing so bypasses dollar transactions. It weakens dollar strength.</p>
<p>Putin said &#8220;the historical memory of the great heroism of our peoples in World War II brings Russia and China even closer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both leaders agreed to hold joint celebrations. They&#8217;ll commemorate &#8220;the 70th anniversary of Victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other international issues were discussed. They include common geopolitical ones. Similar priorities are shared. Closer coordination is planned.</p>
<p>Sino/Russian unity, partnership and friendship were strengthened. It&#8217;s a &#8220;new stage&#8221; in &#8220;strategic relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strong bilateral relations are a force to be reckoned with. It promises to be more so ahead.</p>
<p>Moscow remains justifiably angry. It&#8217;s enraged about Washington elevating Kiev putschists to power. Rogue EU partners share blame.</p>
<p>Putin and Xi said crisis conditions can only be resolved diplomatically. They demand dialogue. They reject confrontation.</p>
<p>They &#8220;urged all Ukrainian regions and public and political groups to enter in broad nationwide talks…&#8221;</p>
<p>They want responsible governance. They want legitimate constitutional development.</p>
<p>They want &#8220;universally recognized rights and freedoms of people&#8221; observed.</p>
<p>Sergey Lavrov said Russian/EU/US-led NATO relations need fundamental reconsideration.</p>
<p>They require &#8220;essential rethinking,&#8221; he said. Disagreements must be resolved diplomatically, he stressed.</p>
<p>US-led NATO created Ukrainian crisis conditions. Russia targeting followed.</p>
<p>Western forces irresponsibly expand eastward. Encroaching on Russia&#8217;s borders threatens its heartland.</p>
<p>Bilateral relations are jeopardized. East/West confrontation is risked. So is world peace.</p>
<p>The road to Moscow runs through Kiev. Junta power has no legitimacy. Fundamental freedoms are targeted.</p>
<p>Eliminating them altogether is planned. Hardline rules runs things. Opposition isn&#8217;t tolerated.</p>
<p>Free expression is verboten. Putschists want their message alone getting out. They want vital truths suppressed.</p>
<p>Independent journalists aren&#8217;t safe. Russian LifeNews ones were targeted.</p>
<p>Oleg Sidyankin and Marat Saichenk were harassed. They were arrested. They&#8217;re detained. They&#8217;re held incommunicado.</p>
<p>Their lives potentially are endangered. They&#8217;re charged with &#8220;aiding terrorist groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>They released damning video images. They showed Kiev military forces using UN-marked attack helicopters against their own people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Air and ground assaults murder them in cold blood. Kiev wants this type information buried.</p>
<p>It wants reliable news sources eliminated. RT International&#8217;s stringer journalist Graham Phillips was arrested.</p>
<p>He explained by phone before silenced incommunicado, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m sitting at a blockade post in a portacabin. The dialogue is quite interrogation oriented.&#8221;</p>
<p>His car was searched. His laptop, equipment and personal belongings were confiscated.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment I’m with the Ukrainian forces…near Mariupol,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here for over two hours and I&#8217;ve been described, my status, as being detained in terms of I can&#8217;t leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would also say I&#8217;m being treated OK…I believe that someone is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve done checks on my documentation. They found my reports and clips I&#8217;ve done and they&#8217;re now looking through them asking me my position on things, asking if I&#8217;m a spy, and asking me quite thorough questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve checked all my documentation and photos, my laptop and the car. So that&#8217;s who I&#8217;m with at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was asked about separatism. About working with RT. He &#8220;describ(ed) (his) position on Crimea.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called its referendum legitimate. He stands by his position, he said.</p>
<p>He called Kiev&#8217;s government illegitimate. It &#8220;isn&#8217;t democratic. I don&#8217;t support this current situation in the east of Ukraine,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In Donetsk and Lugansk regions. He called attacking Eastern Ukrainians &#8220;completely wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, he &#8220;maintains complete objectivity and neutrality as a correspondent.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bulletproof jacket and helmet were confiscated. He’s unharmed so far, he said. Incommunicado since cut off there&#8217;s no way to know for sure.</p>
<p>Right Sector thugs targeted him. They put a bounty on his head. They offered $10,000 for his capture.</p>
<p>They called him a &#8220;Russian spy.&#8221; His life&#8217;s endanger in their hands. Or in sight to be shot in cold blood.</p>
<p>Radicalized Kiev elements posted a Facebook comment. He &#8220;works for terrorists,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;(H)e photographs and publishes the location of Ukrainian troops…&#8221;</p>
<p>He &#8220;spreads disinformation. (He publishes) Putin&#8217;s propaganda in the media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be immediately detained by Ukrainian forces ad deported from Ukraine.&#8221; Orders come from &#8220;EuroMaidan leaders,&#8221; it claimed.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s Foreign Ministry condemned his detention. Its human rights commissioner Konstantin Dolgov called it media obstruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is another step…made by Ukrainian authorities to curb the activities of unwanted journalists,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They &#8220;work professionally and show an objective picture, the ugly side of the outrages made by ultranationalists, the results of (Kiev putschists&#8217;) punitive operation in the southeast,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>Seizing Phillips constitutes an &#8220;unlawful seizure, detention of Russian journalists.&#8221; Moscow demands all lawlessly detained media representatives be released.</p>
<p>Kiev &#8220;continues its vicious line,&#8221; Dolgov added. Coup-appointed officials spurn their &#8220;international obligations concerning freedom of speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>They target media freedom. They want it eliminated altogether. They want their message alone reported. They want truth buried.</p>
<p>They want fascist putschist power enhanced. They deplore democratic values.</p>
<p>They want ordinary Ukrainians having no say. Polls show their popularity eroding. They risk losing it overwhelmingly.</p>
<p>Perhaps nationwide rebellion will follow. When ruthlessness exceeds levels too great to tolerate, all bets are off.</p>
<p>The only solution is nonviolent revolution. Perhaps just a matter of time. It can&#8217;t happen a moment too soon.</p>

			<p style="color: #000000;">Imagine: you are dressed up for a night on Broadway, but your neighbours are involved in a vicious quarrel, and you have to gun up and deal with the trouble instead of enjoying a show, and a dinner, and perhaps a date. This was Putin’s position regarding the Ukrainian turmoil.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Russians have readjusted their sights, but they do not intend to bring their troops into the two rebel republics, unless dramatic developments should force them.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is not much fun to be in Kiev these days. The revolutionary excitement is over, and hopes for new faces, the end of corruption and economic improvement have withered. The Maidan street revolt and the subsequent coup just reshuffled the same marked deck of cards, forever rotating in power.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The new acting President has been an acting prime minister, and a KGB (called “SBU” in Ukrainian) supremo. The new acting prime minister has been a foreign minister. The oligarch most likely to be “elected” President in a few days has been a foreign minister, the head of the state bank, and personal treasurer of two coups, in 2004 (installing Yushchenko) and in 2014 (installing himself). His main competitor, Mme Timoshenko, served as a prime minister for years, until electoral defeat in 2010.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">These people had brought Ukraine to its present abject state. In 1991, the Ukraine was richer than Russia, today it is three times poorer because of these people’s mismanagement and theft. Now they plan an old trick: to take loans in Ukraine’s name, pocket the cash and leave the country indebted. They sell state assets to Western companies and ask for NATO to come in and protect the investment.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">They play a hard game, brass knuckles and all. The Black Guard, a new SS-like armed force of the neo-nazi Right Sector, prowls the land. They arrest or kill dissidents, activists, journalists. Hundreds of American soldiers, belonging to the “private” company Academi (formerly Blackwater) are spread out in Novorossia, the pro-Russian provinces in the East and South-East. IMF–dictated reforms slashed pensions by half and doubled the housing rents. In the market, US Army rations took the place of local food.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The new Kiev regime had dropped the last pretence of democracy by expelling the Communists from the parliament. This should endear them to the US even more. Expel Communists, apply for NATO, condemn Russia, arrange a gay parade and you may do anything at all, even fry dozens of citizens alive. And so they did.</p>
<div><a style="color: #d00000;" href="http://i0.wp.com/mycatbirdseat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Odessa.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-57378" src="http://i0.wp.com/mycatbirdseat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Odessa.jpg?resize=540%2C303" alt="Odessa" width="540" height="303" /></a></p>
</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">The harshest repressions were unleashed on industrial Novorossia, as its working class loathes the whole lot of oligarchs and ultra-nationalists. After the blazing inferno of Odessa and a wanton shooting on the streets of Melitopol the two rebellious provinces of Donetsk and Lugansk took up arms and declared their independence from the Kiev regime. They came under fire, but did not surrender. The other six Russian-speaking industrial provinces of Novorossia were quickly cowed. Dnepropetrovsk and Odessa were terrorised by personal army of Mr Kolomoysky; Kharkov was misled by its tricky governor.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Russia did not interfere and did not support the rebellion, to the great distress of Russian nationalists in Ukraine and Russia who mutter about “betrayal”. So much for the warlike rhetoric of McCain and Brzezinski.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin’s respect for others’ sovereignty is exasperating. I understand this sounds like a joke, — you hear so much about Putin as a “new Hitler”. As a matter of fact, Putin had legal training before joining the Secret Service. He is a stickler for international law. His Russia has interfered with other states much less than France or England, let alone the US. I asked his senior adviser, Mr Alexei Pushkov, why Russia did not try to influence Ukrainian minds while Kiev buzzed with American and European officials. “We think it is wrong to interfere”, he replied like a good Sunday schoolboy. It is rather likely Putin’s advisors misjudged public sentiment. « The majority of Novorossia’s population does not like the new Kiev regime, but being politically passive and conservative, will submit to its rule”, they estimated. “The rebels are a small bunch of firebrands without mass support, and they can’t be relied upon”, was their view. Accordingly, Putin advised the rebels to postpone the referendum indefinitely, a polite way of saying “drop it”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">They disregarded his request with considerable <em>sang froid</em> and convincingly voted <em>en masse</em> for secession from a collapsing Ukraine. The turnout was much higher than expected, the support for the move near total. As I was told by a Kremlin insider, this development was not foreseen by Putin’s advisers.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Perhaps the advisors had read it right, but three developments had changed the voters’ minds and had sent this placid people to the barricades and the voting booths:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>1. </strong>The first one was the fiery holocaust of Odessa, where the peaceful and carelessly unarmed demonstrating workers were suddenly attacked by regime’s thugs (the Ukrainian equivalent of Mubarak’s shabab) and corralled into the Trade Unions Headquarters. The building was set on fire, and the far-right pro-regime Black Guard positioned snipers to efficiently pick off would-be escapees. Some fifty, mainly elderly, Russian-speaking workers were burned alive or shot as they rushed for the windows and the doors. This dreadful event was turned into an occasion of merriment and joy by Ukrainian nationalists who referred to their slain compatriots as “fried beetles”. (It is being said that this auto-da-fé was organised by the shock troops of Jewish oligarch and strongman Kolomoysky, who coveted the port of Odessa. Despite his cuddly bear appearance, he is pugnacious and violent person, who offered ten thousand dollars for a captive Russian, dead or alive, and proposed a cool million dollars for the head of Mr Tsarev, a Member of Parliament from Donetsk.)</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>2. </strong>The second was the Mariupol attack on May 9, 2014. This day is commemorated as V-day in Russia and Ukraine (while the West celebrates it on May 8). The Kiev regime forbade all V-day celebrations. In Mariupol, the Black Guard attacked the peaceful and weaponless town, burning down the police headquarters and killing local policemen who had refused to suppress the festive march. Afterwards, Black Guard thugs unleashed armoured vehicles on the streets, killing citizens and destroying property.</p>
<p><a style="color: #d00000;" href="http://i2.wp.com/mycatbirdseat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Merkel-and-Nuland.jpg"><img class="wp-image-58966" src="http://i2.wp.com/mycatbirdseat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Merkel-and-Nuland.jpg?resize=400%2C225" alt="&quot;That would be Great to help Glue this thing...And you know Fuck the EU&quot; --American Diplomat, Asst. Secretary of State Nuland caught on tape." width="400" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The West did not voice any protest; Nuland and Merkel weren’t horrified by this mass murder, as they were by Yanukovich’s timid attempts to control crowds.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The people of these two provinces felt abandoned; they understood that nobody was going to protect and save them but themselves, and went off to vote.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">3. The third development was, bizarrely, the Eurovision jury choice of Austrian transvestite Conchita Wurst for a winner of its song contest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The sound-minded Novorossians decided they want no part of such a Europe.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Actually, the people of Europe do not want it either:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It <a style="color: #d00000;" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/eurovision-2014-voting-controversy-after-uk-jury-revealed-to-place-conchita-first--but-british-public-voted-for-donatan--cleo-9351644.html">transpired</a> that the majority of British viewers preferred a Polish duo, Donatan &amp; Cleo, with its <em>We Are Slavic</em>. Donatan is half Russian, and has courted controversy in the past extolling the virtues of pan-Slavism and the achievements of the Red Army, says the <em>Independent</em>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The politically correct judges of the jury preferred to “celebrate tolerance”, the dominant paradigm imposed upon Europe.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is the second transvestite to win this very political contest; the first one was Israeli singer Dana International.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Such obsession with re-gendering did not go down well with Russians and/or Ukrainians.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Russians have readjusted their sights, but they do not intend to bring their troops into the two rebel republics, unless dramatic developments should force them.<em><br />

<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>RUSSIAN PLANS<br />

</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">Imagine: you are dressed up for a night on Broadway, but your neighbours are involved in a vicious quarrel, and you have to gun up and deal with the trouble instead of enjoying a show, and a dinner, and perhaps a date. This was Putin’s position regarding the Ukrainian turmoil.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A few months ago, Russia had made a huge effort to become, and to be seen as, a very civilized European state of the first magnitude. This was the message of the Sochi <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/02/21/the-attacks-on-the-sochi-games/">Olympic games</a>: to re-brand, even re-invent Russia, just as Peter the Great once had, as part of the First World; an amazing country of strong European tradition, of Leo Tolstoy and Malevich, of Tchaikovsky and Diaghilev, the land of arts, of daring social reform, of technical achievements, of modernity and beyond — the Russia of Natasha Rostova riding a Sikorsky ‘copter. Putin spent $60 billion to broadcast this image.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The old fox Henry Kissinger wisely <a href="http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2014/05/10/kissinger-putin-likely-didnt-plan-to-bring-ukraine-situation-to-a-head/">said</a>:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin spent $60 billion on the Olympics. They had opening and closing ceremonies, trying to show Russia as a normal progressive state. So it isn’t possible that he, three days later, would voluntarily start an assault on Ukraine. There is no doubt that… at all times he wanted Ukraine in a subordinate position. And at all times, every senior Russian that I’ve ever met, including dissidents like Solzhenitsyn and Brodsky, looked at Ukraine as part of the Russian heritage. But I don’t think he had planned to bring it to a head now.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, Washington hawks decided to do whatever it takes to keep Russia out in the cold. They were afraid of this image of “a normal progressive state” as such Russia would render NATO irrelevant and undermine European dependence on the US. They were adamant about retaining their hegemony, shattered as it was by the <a href="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/TheCape.htm">Syrian confrontation</a>. They attacked Russian positions in the Ukraine and arranged a violent coup, <a href="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/BrownRevolution.htm">installing a viciously anti-Russian regime</a> supported by football fans and neo-Nazis, paid for by Jewish oligarchs and American taxpayers. The victors banned the Russian language and prepared to void treaties with Russia regarding its Crimean naval base at Sebastopol on the Black Sea. This base was to become a great new NATO base, controlling the Black Sea and threatening Russia.</p>
<p>Putin had to deal quickly and so he did, by <a href="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/PutinsTriumph.htm">accepting the Crimean people’s</a> request to join Russian Federation. This dealt with the immediate problem of the base, but the problem of Ukraine remained.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Ukraine is not a foreign entity to Russians, it is the western half of Russia. It was artificially separated from the rest in 1991, at the collapse of the USSR. The people of the two parts are interconnected by family, culture and blood ties; their economies are intricately connected. While a separate viable Ukrainian state is a possibility, an “independent” Ukrainian state hostile to Russia is not viable and can’t be tolerated by any Russian ruler. And this for military as well as for cultural reasons: if Hitler had begun the war against Russia from its present border, he would have taken Stalingrad in two days and would have destroyed Russia in a week.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A more pro-active Russian ruler would have sent troops to Kiev a long time ago. Thus did Czar Alexis when the Poles, Cossacks and Tatars argued for it in 17<sup>th</sup> century. So also did Czar Peter the Great, when the Swedes occupied it in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. So did Lenin, when the Germans set up the Protectorate of Ukraine (he called its establishment “the obscene peace”). So did Stalin, when the Germans occupied the Ukraine in 1941.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin still hopes to settle the problem by peaceful means, relying upon the popular support of the Ukrainian people. Actually, before the Crimean takeover, the majority of Ukrainians (and near all Novorossians) overwhelmingly supported some sort of union with Russia. Otherwise, the Kiev coup would not have been necessary. The forced Crimean takeover seriously undermined Russian appeal. The people of Ukraine did not like it. This was foreseen by the Kremlin, but they had to accept Crimea for a few reasons. Firstly, a loss of Sevastopol naval base to NATO was a too horrible of an alternative to contemplate. Secondly, the Russian people would not understand if Putin were to refuse the suit of the Crimeans.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Washington hawks still hope to force Putin to intervene militarily, as it would give them the opportunity to isolate Russia, turn it into a monster pariah state, beef up defence spending and set Europe and Russia against each other. They do not care about Ukraine and Ukrainians, but use them as pretext to attain geopolitical goals.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Europeans would like to fleece Ukraine; to import its men as “illegal” workers and its women as prostitutes, to strip assets, to colonise. They did it with Moldova, a little sister of Ukraine, the most miserable ex-Soviet Republic. As for Russia, the EU would not mind taking it down a notch, so they would not act so grandly. But the EU is not fervent about it. Hence, the difference in attitudes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin would prefer to continue with his modernisation of Russia. The country needs it badly. The infrastructure lags twenty or thirty years behind the West. Tired by this backwardness, young Russians often prefer to move to the West, and this brain drain causes much damage to Russia while enriching the West. Even Google is a result of this brain drain, for Sergey Brin is a Russian immigrant as well. So are hundreds of thousands of Russian scientists and artists manning every Western lab, theatre and orchestra. Political liberalisation is not enough: the young people want good roads, good schools and a quality of life comparable to the West. This is what Putin intends to deliver.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He is doing a fine job of it. Moscow now has free bikes and Wi-Fi in the parks like every Western European city. Trains have been upgraded. Hundreds of thousands of apartments are being built, even more than during the Soviet era. Salaries and pensions have increased seven-to-tenfold in the past decade. Russia is still shabby, but it is on the right track. Putin wants to continue this modernisation.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As for the Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states, Putin would prefer they retain their independence, be friendly and work at a leisurely pace towards integration a la the European Union.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">He does not dream of a new empire. He would reject such a proposal, as it would delay his modernisation plans.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">If the beastly neocons would not have forced his hand by expelling the legitimate president of Ukraine and installing their puppets, the world might have enjoyed a long spell of peace.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But then the western military alliance under the US leadership would fall into abeyance, US military industries would lose out, and US hegemony would evaporate. Peace is not good for the US military and hegemony-creating media machine. So dreams of peace in our lifetime are likely to remain just dreams.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What will Putin do?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin will try to avoid sending in troops as long as possible. He will have to protect the two splinter provinces, but this can be done with remote support, the way the US supports the rebels in Syria, without ‘boots on the ground’. Unless serious bloodshed on a large scale should occur, Russian troops will just stand by, staring down the Black Guard and other pro-regime forces.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Putin will try to find an arrangement with the West for sharing authority, influence and economic involvement in the failed state. This can be done through federalisation, or by means of coalition government, or even partition. The Russian-speaking provinces of Novorossia are those of Kharkov (industry), Nikolayev (ship-building), Odessa (harbour), Donetsk and Lugansk (mines and industry), Dnepropetrovsk (missiles and high-tech), Zaporozhe (steel), Kherson (water for Crimea and ship-building), all of them established, built and populated by Russians. They could secede from Ukraine and form an independent Novorossia, a mid-sized state, but still bigger than some neighbouring states. This state could join the Union State of Russia and Belarus, and/or the Customs Union led by Russia. The rump Ukraine could manage as it sees fit until it decides whether or not to join its Slavic sisters in the East. Such a set up would produce two rather cohesive and homogeneous states.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Another possibility (much less likely at this moment) is a three-way division of the failed Ukraine: Novorossia, Ukraine proper, and Galicia&amp;Volyn. In such a case, Novorossia would be strongly pro-Russian, Ukraine would be neutral, and Galicia strongly pro-Western.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The EU could accept this, but the US probably would not agree to any power-sharing in the Ukraine. In the ensuing tug-of-war, one of two winners will emerge. If Europe and the US drift apart, Russia wins. If Russia accepts a pro-Western positioning of practically all of Ukraine, the US wins. The tug-of-war could snap and cause all-out war, with many participants and a possible use of nuclear weapons. This is a game of chicken; the one with stronger nerves and less imagination will remain on the track.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Pro and Contra</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is too early to predict who will win in the forthcoming confrontation. For the Russian president, it is extremely tempting to take all of Ukraine or at least Novorossia, but it is not an easy task, and one likely to cause much hostility from the Western powers. With Ukraine incorporated, Russian recovery from 1991 would be completed, its strength doubled, its security ensured and a grave danger removed. Russia would become great again. People would venerate Putin as Gatherer of Russian Lands.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, Russian efforts to appear as a modern peaceful progressive state would have been wasted; it would be seen as an aggressor and expelled from international bodies. Sanctions will bite; high tech imports may be banned, as in the Soviet days. The Russian elites are reluctant to jeopardize their good life. The Russian military just recently began its modernization and is not keen to fight yet, perhaps not for another ten years.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But if they feel cornered, if NATO moves into Eastern Ukraine, they will fight all the same.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Some Russian politicians and observers believe that Ukraine is a basket case; its problems would be too expensive to fix. This assessment has a ‘sour grapes’ aftertaste, but it is widespread. An interesting new voice on the web, The Saker, <a href="http://vineyardsaker.blogspot.ru/2014/05/a-look-in-long-distance-who-will-have.html">promotes this view</a>. “Let the EU and the US provide for the Ukrainians, they will come back to Mother Russia when hungry”, he says. The problem is, they will not be allowed to reconsider. The junta did not seize power violently in order to lose it at the ballot box.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Besides, Ukraine is not in such bad shape as some people claim. Yes, it would cost trillions to turn it into a Germany or France, but that’s not necessary. Ukraine can reach the Russian level of development very quickly –- in union with Russia. Under the EC-IMF-NATO, Ukraine <em>will</em> become a basket case, if it’s not already. The same is true for all East European ex-Soviet states: they can modestly prosper with Russia, as Belarus and Finland do, or suffer depopulation, unemployment, poverty with Europe and NATO and against Russia, <em>vide</em> Latvia, Hungary, Moldova, Georgia. It is in Ukrainian interests to join Russia in some framework; Ukrainians understand that; for this reason they will not be allowed to have democratic elections.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Simmering Novorossia has a potential to change the game. If Russian troops don’t come in, Novorossian rebels may beat off the Kiev offensive and embark on a counter-offensive to regain the whole of the country, despite Putin’s pacifying entreaties. Then, in a full-blown civil war, the Ukraine will hammer out its destiny.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">On a personal level, Putin faces a hard choice. Russian nationalists will not forgive him if he surrenders Ukraine without a fight. The US and EU threaten the very life of the Russian president, as their sanctions are hurting Putin’s close associates, encouraging them to get rid of or even assassinate the President and improve their relations with the mighty West. War may come at any time, as it came twice during the last century – though Russia tried to avoid it both times. Putin wants to postpone it, at the very least, but not at any price.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">His is not an easy choice. As Russia procrastinates, as the US doubles the risks, the world draws nearer to the nuclear abyss. Who will chicken out?</p>

			<p style="color: #000000;"><img src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Panem_map.jpg" alt="" />One of the most popular films of 2012 was <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008602KQI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B008602KQI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=ZWKIYED6NU3XVRTV" target="_blank"><em><strong>The Hunger Games</strong></em></a> which portrayed a post-apocalyptic nation called Panem in which a super-rich, super-pampered, super-callous ‘elite’ lived in high-tech luxury while the rest of the population daily battled to survive in abject poverty locked away behind prison fences in intensively-populated ‘people zones’. Panem comes from the Latin phrase <em>‘panem et circenses’</em> or ‘bread and circuses’ — a term derived from Rome and meaning to give the people diversions and distractions to hide what is being done to them. Exactly what is happening today.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Totalitarian Tiptoes to just such a world are happening all around us, although most people can’t see this because they don’t connect the dots. People tend to live in their own ‘little world’ and focus on only a few subjects and interests. This gives them a distorted view of what is happening because they are so busy concentrating on the strands that they cannot see the tapestry. The world of <em>The Hunger Games</em> is already well on the way to fruition unless humanity has a fundamental reassessment of reality.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The foundations, structure and ‘must haves’ of a Hunger Games society are detailed in a plan being imposed through the United Nations called <strong>Agenda 21</strong> which encompasses two related themes of ‘sustainable development’ and ‘biodiversity’. Sustainable development — as in don’t use more than can be replaced — sounds sensible enough at first until you realize what this and biodiversity really mean in the context of the conspiracy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/02/11/city-ordinance-nightmare-texas-homeowner-facing-2600-fines-weeds/" target="_blank">Agenda 21</a> was established at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, in 1992, hosted by <strong>Maurice Strong</strong>, a Canadian oil and business billionaire and long-time front man for the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/01/23/who-really-controls-the-world/" target="_blank"><strong>Rothschilds</strong></a> and <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/05/the-shady-past-of-the-rockefeller-family-its-haunting-effect-on-the-world/" target="_blank"><strong>Rockefellers</strong></a>. Strong has been a leader of their exploit-the-environment-to-scam-the-people programme which is now in full flow. Strong is a member of the <strong>Club of Rome</strong>, the environmental Hidden Hand in the <strong>Round Table</strong> network that includes the <strong>Bilderberg Group</strong>, <strong>Trilateral Commission</strong> and <strong>Council on Foreign Relations</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Strong said in support of Agenda 21:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘Isn’t the only hope for this planet that the industrialised civilization collapse? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?’</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a man who became mega-rich through the oil industry. He now lives in billionaire luxury in China where carbon-emitting industry is booming and he is a director of the Chicago Climate Exchange (largest shareholder, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>), which is <em>‘the world’s first and North America’s only legally-binding greenhouse-gas emission registry reduction-system for emission sources and offset projects in North America and Brazil’</em>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Exchange was established with funding from the Joyce Foundation where <strong>Barack Obama</strong> was once a director. Strong and <strong>Al Gore</strong> make money through the Carbon Exchange and other means from the lies they promote about climate change and the solutions they propose. Kate Johnston wrote on the <em>Globalresearch.ca</em>website:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘The same men that sold us the myth of man-made global warming are the same men that sold us the “solution” of a Carbon Tax and Emissions Trading Scheme and now they’re profiting off their lucrative investments which are based on lies.’</em> (See <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://julianwebsdale.tumblr.com/post/72890748737/the-climate-change-hoax">“The Climate Change Hoax”</a>).</p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">Strong fled to China in 2006 after being accused of corruption with respect to the UN oil for food program.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Climate change propaganda is a No-Problem-Reaction-Solution technique to justify Agenda 21 and its stable-mate the <strong>Biodiversity Treaty</strong>. This is an internationally-binding document involving nearly 200 countries. The United States signed the treaty, but it was not ratified by the Senate after people like ecologist and ecosystem scientist Dr. Michael Coffman exposed its true consequences and implications. He said that he realized during the 1980s and 1990s that the plan was to use the excuse of protecting the environment to confiscate half the land of the United States.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Similar plans exist for every other country. America may not have ratified the treaty, but it is being implemented by the day. Agenda 21 demands the central global control of all land; all private property; all water sources and distribution; all other resources which includes people in its definition; all energy supplies and distribution and all food production and distribution.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Agenda 21 is called <em>‘the agenda for the 21st century’</em> and that refers to global fascism / communism. This is a summary of what Agenda 21 / Sustainable Development / Biodiversity is seeking to impose:</p>
<ul>
<li class="perle">An end to national sovereignty</li>
<li class="perle">State planning and management of all land resources, ecosystems, deserts, forests, mountains, oceans and fresh water; agriculture; rural development; biotechnology; and ensuring ‘equity’ (equal slavery)</li>
<li class="perle">The State to ‘define the role’ of business and financial resources</li>
<li class="perle">Abolition of private property (it’s not ‘sustainable’)</li>
<li class="perle">‘Restructuring’ the family unit</li>
<li class="perle">Children raised by the State</li>
<li class="perle">People told what their job will be</li>
<li class="perle">Major restrictions on movement</li>
<li class="perle">Creation of ‘human settlement zones’</li>
<li class="perle">Mass resettlement as people are forced to vacate land where they currently live</li>
<li class="perle">Dumbing down education (achieved)</li>
<li class="perle">Mass global depopulation in pursuit of all the above</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #000000;">This horrific plan is being coordinated through the United Nations, the stalking horse for world dictatorship, via a non-governmental network once called the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives ICLEI), and now known as Local Governments for Sustainability although still using the shortened name ICLEI. The United Nations is now opening ‘embassies’ around the world called ‘UN Houses’ under the guise of raising awareness of UN activities, but not the activities that people really need to know about. They have opened one in Hunter Square, Edinburgh, Scotland, for example.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) and other organisations are integrating the plan into every village, town, city and region and it is already becoming widespread across the world. The organisational infrastructure of Agenda 21 is already fantastic and involves government agencies, non-governmental organisations (<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/03/06/education-elite-mono-minding-global-plans-children/" target="_blank">NGOs</a>), think-tanks, trusts, foundations, ‘training’ (mind control) operations and ‘initiatives’ which have been building the infrastructure for what they call ‘the post-industrial, post-democratic’ society while the public go about their daily business oblivious of the prison being built all around them by the hour.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Harvey Ruvin</strong>, a vice-chairman of ICLEI, was asked how Agenda 21 would affect liberties with regard to the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, private property and freedom of speech. He replied:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>‘Individual rights must take a back-seat to the collective.’</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">The arrogance of these people is breathtaking. The extraordinary network supporting ICLEI and Agenda 21 includes the Rockefeller-sponsored America 2050; United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG); Metropolis; World Economic Forum; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction; World Bank; <strong>Clinton</strong> Climate Initiative; Climate Group (<strong>Tony Blair</strong>); World Conservation Union (IUCN); Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership; Global Footprint Network; Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership; Global Footprint Network; International Centre for Sustainable Cities; Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative and the Stakeholder Forum. These and so many others are working to the same end — Agenda 21 and total human enslavement worldwide, although most of those involved will have no idea that they are building a global prison for themselves and their families.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Another of these front organisations is the World Business Council for Sustainable Development which includes the hideously anti-people <strong>Monsanto</strong>. Destroying food-growing land, contaminating the countryside with toxins and replacing proper food with deadly and soil-destroying genetically-modified organisms is Monsanto’s contribution to ‘sustainability’. Agenda 21 is operating in more than 600 towns, cities and counties in the United States and expanding by the day.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A member of the Agenda 21 committees in Santa Cruz, California, in the mid-1990s said that the proposals he heard were so crazy that he laughed at them because they could never happen. These included that ‘Mother Earth’s surface was not to be scratched’; humans should be concentrated in settlement zones; education should focus on the environment as a central organising principle and all aspects of life covered by Agenda 21, but all of these crazy plans are now being introduced. It’s all happy, feely, smiling faces and how we care, when the truth is that Agenda 21 is a vicious, brutal, heartless strategy to impose a global <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/07/03/whistleblower-edward-snowden-releases-statement-from-moscow-still-seeking-asylum/" target="_blank">Orwellian state</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Agenda 21 manipulators either create or hijack some local organisation or other, many of them in locations with large populations, and they have their (controlled) leadership to agree the Agenda 21 blueprint for their community together with any uninformed, unwitting idiots who can be sold a human nightmare as saving the planet. This allows them to claim that decisions were made after ‘public participation’ when that would have been the last thing they wanted, and 99 percent of the ‘community’ has never heard of Agenda 21 let alone had their say on it. They want <em>no</em> democracy which is why these people talk privately, sometimes even publicly, about the post-democratic, post-industrial society.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">They want to control every man, woman and child on the planet — everyone and everywhere and every resource, water source and piece of land. To do this they need a global structure of fascist control that goes right down into every local community with the jackboots at local level enforcing the will of the global centre. This is why there is so much emphasis on local authorities and town and city authorities in Agenda 21.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is a ‘training organisation’ called <strong>Common Purpose</strong> (common purpose, common consensus, everyone the same) which has been paid very large amounts of money by governments and local authorities, police forces and other institutions of state to ‘train the leaders’ of the post-democratic, post-industrial society. Common Purpose was heavily represented in the Leveson ‘inquiry’ leading to new media laws in Britain. It is not a training programme; it is a <em>programming</em> programme and turns out unquestioning zombie administrators who serve the god of Agenda 21 and the associated European Union. The theme of ‘common’ also applies to the ever greater standardisation of laws and regulations and constant reference to ‘international law’. This is the unfolding global dictatorship of Agenda 21. What do you need to be a global dictator? Laws that everyone on the planet must obey — <em>international law and the standardisation of global regulation</em>.</p>

The red areas are designated for no human use and most of the rest of America is confiscated for little and highly-regulated use. The mass of the population would be concentrated in high-rise, densely-packed ‘human settlement zones’ and denied access to something like 80 percent of present day America. It is without question the world of <em>The Hunger Games</em> with a globally-enforced top-down hierarchy that has a world government using its world army and police force to impose its will at regional and local levels (sectors). The Rockefeller-funded America 2050 has produced a map of the new United States divided into eleven ‘megaregions’ and includes parts of Canada (Figure 2). Seattle, Portland and Vancouver, British Columbia, become the megaregion known as ‘Cascadia’ and this regional system comes under the collective name of ‘megalopolis’ which is Greek for large city or great city. America, Canada and Mexico are due to merge to form the North American Union in line with the European Union blueprint.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">The <strong>European Union is planned to be broken up into regions</strong> and the same structure is in development all over the world. The map of the new Europe has regions from different countries linked up with regions in other countries to end any vestige of national sovereignty or even national existence (Figure 3). This is a global plan with its fierce central control hidden behind its lower elements such as the European Union and local government. What is planned would clearly require a fantastic reduction of the global population and this is indeed what Agenda 21 / Sustainable Development / Biodiversity demand.</p>

<p>The enormous energy spent on analyzing candidates and predicting elections is time wasted when the actual decisions are predetermined before the voting takes place. Even excluding voter fraud from the final count, the party selection process has made the decision. The pretense that primaries reflect the will of the electorate deceives the registered voter, amuses the party insiders and benefits the advertisement and media moguls. Ideas, policy positions and core principles take a back seat to the art of spinning and negatively defining the opponent.</p>
<p>Rivals start within your own party. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/10/us/politics/republicans-tighten-grip-on-debates-in-2016-race.html?_r=0">Republicans Tighten Grip on Debates in 2016 Race</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Party leaders want to tighten their grip on a presidential primary season they believe has grown unruly and too long. This year, the party moved to set the nominating calendar by scheduling the first four contests — Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada — for February, allowing other states to begin voting in March and holding winner-take-all primaries starting March 15.</p>
<p>Taken together, these procedural steps could thwart an underfunded insurgent who needs the free exposure of televised debates and would be hurt by a series of rapid-fire contests in March that could be tilted toward an establishment-backed contender.</p>
<p>A few conservative stalwarts on the committee are nervous about the establishment’s consolidation of power over the primaries. &#8220;Do we want a committee of the national committee, which will surely be controlled by the national chairman, picking which candidates participate in all Republican presidential debates?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This point is illustrated in the AP report <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_REPUBLICANS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-05-07-11-29-40">RNC Changes debate Rules for 2016</a>. &#8220;The RNC rules panel endorsed the creation of a 13-person committee that would limit how many presidential debates can take place and who can ask the questions. The full committee on Friday went along with that plan to ban candidates who participate in scofflaw debates from future RNC-backed sessions, by a 152-to-7 vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the usual ceremonial indignation takes hold, ask yourself what is exactly sacrosanct about a stacked primary system that has little to do with an open contest. Patricians that make up the GOP establishment long ago graduated from the country club set.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the bleeding hearts over at Salon would have you believe that the Democrats operate by different rules. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/05/09/the_lefts_best_2016_move_why_democrats_need_a_primary_too/">Why Democrats need a primary, too</a> offers advice why the anointed &#8220;Queen of Mean&#8221; that Rodman woman, would attain a benediction from going through an orchestrated charade before her canonization.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Clinton would benefit from that input just as all incumbents and other party luminaries do, despite the fact that they would rather not have to have that fight. It is not good for a president to take the office without having taken the temperature of his or her supporters and understanding what they care about and what they expect. During a tempestuous period like this one, it’s even more important than usual. It would only be to her advantage to have a challenger who could bring forth those issues and allow the public to see them argued before she goes up against a Republican.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Lost in the fervor of progressive rhetoric is that the Democratic Party is just as elitist as the Republicans are. Both operate as useful idiots and corporatist tools of a system that has long ago abandoned the practice of free enterprise.</p>
<p>Contrast this American version of a Punch and Judy show that has an elephant bully bemoaning the folk hero Robin Hood, who actually resembles an ass, with the exceptional Broadway Play, &#8220;The Best Man&#8221; by Gore Vidal. Watch the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057883/">1964 movie version</a> and consider just how far the political system has collapsed in half a century.</p>
<p>The basic assumption in the play and movie is that the nominee of the Democratic Party will handedly beat their Republican opponent. Characterizing convention ballot voting by delegates as a genuine selection process may be strange to those who were raised on the myth that registered voters in a state primary really has a voice in the inauguration of the next President.</p>
<p>A system of party bosses and smoke room dealmakers, surely must be far worse from the televised mortifying pilgrimage and penitent self-flagellation that goes into winning the party’s nomination? Or, is it . . .</p>
<p>Remember the way the primaries served the faithful Democrats in 2008.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_obama31.htm">news reports</a>, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton went out of their way to hold their long-awaited private meeting in a very specific location &#8211; not at Hillary&#8217;s mansion in Washington &#8211; but in Northern Virginia, which also just happens to be the scene of the 2008 Bilderberg meeting.The neo-liberal website <a href="http://wonkette.com/400268/hillary-baracks-very-special-bilderberg-date-night">Wonkette</a>, which had previously ridiculed &#8220;conspiracy theorists&#8221; for ascribing power to Bilderberg, seemed to take a somewhat different tone when it made the connection between Obama and Hillary&#8217;s meeting and the Bilderberg Group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Orders from on high or more to the point, international deciders had their &#8220;heart to heart&#8221; with Hillary, passing her over, and giving her a maybe for 2016. George W. Bush liked to call himself the <em>decider</em>, but we all should know that decisions out of <em>Skull and Bones</em> are not based upon primary results.</p>
<p>Vidal’s screenplay portrayed a party convention as a real nomination fight. To whatever slime degree existed in the horse-trading to win delegates back then, the appearance in today’s selection makes no pretext of concealing the hidden hands behind picking the next President.</p>
<p>The partisan politics protection racket has but one goal; namely, serve and safeguard establishment interests of the elites, who really command the ultimate power. In addition to the Presidency, Congress shares broad similarities in their version of <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/stevechapman/2010/10/28/the_incumbent_protection_racket/page/full">The Incumbent Protection Racket</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the U.S. House of Representatives, over the past five elections, incumbents have been re-elected at an average rate of 96 percent. According to my unscientific calculations, a congressman is more likely to be eaten by a polar bear while panning for gold in Key West than to be voted out of office.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Serious challenges in Congressional district primacies are rare. The exception was in 2010 with the success of Tea Party candidates. However, such expression of the will of the people cannot stand in the polluted Potomac sewer that passes for representative democracy. Just look at the concerted efforts to sabotage populist support to retool the excesses in the federal government. <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/061310.html">Party Goers &#8211; What Do You Take With Your Tea?</a>, indicates that all the sugar in the Caribbean will not prevent the political diabetes disease from going into shock. The bipartisan protection con knows how to close ranks among the political class.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When main street middle class beleaguered taxpayers resonated that, the system was out of whack, the damage control team went into overdrive. This background helps to explain why the face of unprompted Tea Party individualism must be distorted, maligned and redirected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Great disappointment among Tea Party activists in the hostile welcome from establishment NeoCons has set in. The alternative to playing the no win beltway game provided in <a href="http://www.batr.org/wrack/111113.html">Dissecting U.S. Elections &#8211; the People vs. the Pols</a>, best states the rational solution.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What if a real grassroots national movement emerged that supersedes all ideology with a singular purpose – remove all careerist &#8220;pols&#8221; from office. Forget about the phony No Labels effort to diffuse popular disgust. The solution is to attract the very citizens who NEVER vote in elections.</p>
<p>A national campaign – No Confidence – would be the clear message that the arrogant confidence game crooks could understand.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Drawing upon a universal appeal to break from the travesties of the two party frauds is necessary to register countrywide outrage. Only through vigorous dissention will <a href="http://batr.org/view_/050401.html">The Meaning of Third Parties in America</a>, bring the necessary pressure to collapse both the Democrat and Republican Parties.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The solution to implement meaningful reform is to defuse the political power that is presently concentrated within the ‘Tweedle-dumb and Tweedle Dee&#8217; parties. The notion that differences between them are based upon core principles, denies the unending descent into &#8216;collectivism&#8217;. The edges have varied shapes, but the centers are formed from the same sponge.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You can always resolve that either party will never nominate &#8220;The Best Man&#8221;. If you are so delusional to believe that a woman is the answer in the oval office, look in a different direction. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-controversy-over-elizabeth-warrens-claimed-native-american-heritage/2012/09/27/d0b7f568-08a5-11e2-a10c-fa5a255a9258_blog.html">Elizabeth Warren</a> the self-proclaimed Pinocchio-hontas, is a sorry excuse for an accomplished liar. Flush with law school disingenuous skills, this want-a-be feminine messiah would have you believe that Hillary is the New World Order’s favorite grandmother.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, fake opposition simply projects the image that there is a choice in candidates. Noam Scheiber, in the New Republic writes, &#8220;A Clinton-Warren matchup would have all sorts of consequences, none of them especially heartwarming. The most immediate is that Warren would probably lose.&#8221; Well so much for a contest between squaws, better suited for commitment to the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~sdlincol/hiawatha.htm">Hiawatha Insane Asylum</a>.Partisan politics is mostly a ruse designed to divert attention from service to the substantial interests of establishment globalists. The noise generated around campaigns and media coverage, ignores or conceals the existent deals that serve the real goals and intentions of the master puppeteers. The terminal lesson is that establishment politics treats the public as reservation squatters.</p>

</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">For decades liberals have lobbied against punishment and for rehabilitation. The argument was that a mugger or murderer was just a victim of his environment, someone caught in the crosshairs of bad nurturing and neighborhood. Accountability is unwarranted because the person bears no responsibility: he knew not what he did. And so successful was this movement that our penal system was largely reorganized based on the rehabilitation model. Why, I’ve even argued with people who insisted that “punishment doesn’t work” (apparently, they’d never heard of Singapore, caning and virtually zero crime).</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">So, question: where are the calls for rehabilitation, as opposed to punishment, for “racists” such as Clippers owner Donald Sterling?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And the rehabilitation mentality’s absence isn’t just apparent in the social ostracism and career destruction visited on those accused of the One Liberal Deadly Sin of “racism”*.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">(*Some exceptions may apply.)</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It isn’t even just apparent in the social persecution of supposed “haters” in general, from Brendan Eich to the Boy Scouts to devout Christians.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Just consider leftism-disgorged “hate-crime” law. It proves ever so explicitly that, somehow, liberals have discovered the utility of punishment; after all, they will justify this legislation by saying that since some crimes target whole communities, they’re so destructive that a message must be sent. It appears that when their own ideological ox is being gored, the people who authored the atheist version of “the Devil made him do it” want Devil’s Island.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A good example is Donald Sterling. It’s not enough that he has had his reputation destroyed, been fined $2.5 million and been “banned for life” by the National Bolsheviks Association. There are people who want newspapers to stop accepting his ads. And the bigoted Al Sharpton — proving hypocrisy knows no bounds — had actually said that the Clippers should be disbanded. Yes, and maybe we should adopt the North Korean model of purging Sterling’s family and friends, too. But how much punishment is enough? How many pounds of flesh will sate the rapacious and blood-stained leftist palate? Would only a gulag and a long, slow, painful death suffice for the world’s Sterlings?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">None of this is a surprise if you understand that liberals don’t operate based on principles, but feelings; in keeping with this, liberalism isn’t an ideology. It is a <span style="font-style: italic;">process</span>. Even Marxism has a vision for how society should be (unrealistic though it is), but liberals do not. The only consistent definition of liberalism is “a desire to change the status quo,” which means there will always be, without a guiding vision, directionless, unprincipled change and action. Liberals are the children who ever fight the parents simply because that is the nature of the brat, and they do this even when yesterday’s liberals have become the parents.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">How does this relate to punishment? A person operating on principle, on a vision, will try to tame his emotion and say: here’s the crime, here’s what justice dictates, so here is the proportionate punishment. But with liberals there is no justice — it’s “just us” as they’re governed by the shifting sands of convenience. Their feelings tell them that they hate the transgressor and that they want revenge, and it’s never enough to satisfy them viscerally. It’s as with the feeling of hunger: no matter how much you eat, there’s always another appetite mere hours away.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This governance by emotion helps explain why “*Some exceptions may apply.” It sheds light on why liberals haven’t made a federal case out of Bellville, NJ, Democrat mayoral candidate Marie Strumolo Burke, who lamented proposed tax-rate changes and was <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/04/30/media-refuses-to-identify-party-affiliation-of-new-jersey-democrat-caught-in-racist-rant-audio/" target="_blank">caught</a> on audio exclaiming, “This is gonna be a f*****g n****r town!” It illuminates why they did nothing when then NBA owner Jay-Z threw a 2010 party in which <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2014/05/nba-hypocrisy-black-nba-owner-held.html" target="_blank">no whites were allowed</a>. It even explains why Sterling, whose views were long known, received not only a special dispensation but also acclaim and awards from the left. As part of their political phalanx, liberals don’t hate Burke; they don’t hate bigoted blacks such as Jay-Z; they don’t even hate rich, old white men who pay their dues and pay off the cause. And disconnected from Truth and thus having “situational values,” it’s easy for libs to live in a world of rationalization. Just give them plausible deniability in their own minds, so, as Mark Cuban once said about Sterling, they can shrug off the sin as the eccentricities of a fellow who “plays by his own rules.” But don’t you dare out yourself if you’re a white guy. Don’t become a liability to the cause. It’s as if the mistake isn’t the act (at least if you’re one of the initiated) — the mistake is getting caught.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But with those who aren’t part of their phalanx, liberals will hate, hate, hate; they will hunger for vengeance and, since vengeance never eliminates hate (only forgiveness does), there is never an end to their retribution.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To be clear, I’m not saying that outrage over “racism” is always mere artifice. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it’s reminiscent of medieval heresy accusations, which could be leveled against an individual by vindictive people with an axe to grind. But much of the time if not most, the anger is real.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It’s just selectively triggered.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In rare cases, the transgression itself may be enough to induce the emotional response. Most of the time, however, it’s some combination of transgression+transgressor+<wbr></wbr>situation. Transgressor can negate transgression, as when a black person makes a bigoted remark; or transgressor can magnify transgression, as when a white Republican makes a corresponding remark. If a white Democrat or Democrat enabler does, transgressor status plus a situation in which you somehow maintain that plausible deniability gets you by. If it’s a wealthy, powerful black man whose success is necessary for the cause, as with Barack Obama, well, then you’re bulletproof. Then again, if you’re a wealthy, powerful white man whose failure is necessary for the cause, as with George Allen and “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaca_%28term%29" target="_blank">macaca</a>,” you’re history.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This isn’t to say that most liberals are fully conscious of what animates them. Self-awareness is often lacking among man, and this is especially true among philosophically dysfunctional men (who we today often call liberals). All most leftists know when spewing venom at a supposedly “racist” conservative is that they hate the person, and they assume it’s only because of his transgression. Living situational lives where everything is compartmentalized, they generally don’t know what truly drives them or consider, at the moment they’re wallowing in hatred, that in the past they’ve reacted very differently to liberals in the same boat.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, another factor is that liberals don’t view these transgressions the way a normal person would. They often “feel” — “think” would be the wrong word because, again, leftists generally operate emotionally — that a black’s or liberal’s uttering of a racial remark is of a very different moral species than when a white conservative does so. A black has a right to such sentiments because of the “legacy of slavery.” As for a white liberal, it was perhaps just a weak moment, a slip of the tongue; after all, the person has proven his credentials with his public face as a good leftist foot soldier. If a white conservative says the same thing, however (which never seems nearly as common), it just reflects the deep-seated bigotry that you have to know resides in his dark soul.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Going even deeper, understand that this accords with liberals’ favored reality-denying modern isms. <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nominalism" target="_blank">Nominalism</a> states there is nothing that objectively makes both a tiger and a buff tabby “cats,” categorically speaking — we just happen to view them that way. Likewise, a normal person may see two bigoted statements or two acts of punishment as occupying the same category, but there is, objectively speaking, no such thing as a category called “bigoted statements” or “acts of punishment.” Such classifications only exist in our minds, so we can assign these labels as we see fit. And in deference to relativism, which boils down to the notion that there’s no right or wrong, neither punishment nor rehabilitation can be inherently good or bad, and consistency can be no better than inconsistency.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">At bottom, this is how devout leftists view the world. Subscribing to the Protagorean proposition “Man is the measure of all things” and the apocryphal one “Might makes right,” when they win culture wars and take control, they make themselves the measure of all things. Perhaps the best characterization of their philosophy is occultist Aleister Crowley’s formulation, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And what they wilt do is persecute you. Remember that, nice-guy conservatives, the next time you want to fight them using Queensbury Rules.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The grimmest dictatorship is the dictatorship of the prevailing orthodoxy&#8221; - </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/02/international/europe/02galloway.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=a3295fe213e5261f&amp;ex=1277956800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">George Galloway</a></p>
<p>In a relativism culture of social permissiveness, the non-judgmental attitude, held out as the suitable standard for conduct, has become the politically correct behavior. One might think that anything goes under this mindset. However, the exact opposite practice and enforcement, under the most rigid conditions, is championed as necessary for enlighten and tolerant liberalists. The proliferation of demands that hate speech is the new capital crime, actually is counter iterative in building a civil society. This orthodoxy of the fanatical, proudly presents this illuminated and required deportment, as obligatory for all citizens.</p>
<p>So what exactly is hate for the neo-Jacobins? Obviously, whatever the &#8220;<em>Society of the Friends of the LIVING Constitution</em>&#8221; deems it to be, because under the color of law, the self-proclaimed pure of heart, are justified to off the heads of anyone who dares speak out in inappropriate terms. Remember &#8220;thinking progress&#8221; for the greater good, must be imposed on anyone who dare defies the wisdom of the gatekeepers for the collective.</p>
<p>Racism has to go, unless practiced by Negros against whites, or is the mere mention of such a term a slight to African-Americans? Once upon a time cries of anti-Semitism would be heard if <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/la-naacp-head-resigns-move-honor-sterling-23556060">Donald Sterling</a> was made a pariah after the NAACP did an about face after awarding him for promoting civil rights. Not in today’s world, such a distasteful zealot no longer has the protection of his tribe from the scrutiny of the thought police. The almost total condemnation of his recently private remarks has the entire sports world clambering for his forced sale of the LA Clippers.</p>

<p>Such broad-minded fans in a league that made homies multimillionaires and took them out of the hood, must not be dis. No wonder the attraction of not just the NBA, but sports in general, have serious minded buffs of the Wide World of Sports looking for, &#8220;<em>The Thrill of Victory&#8230;</em>&#8221; in other arenas. Why not demonstrate that sporting enthusiasm and jock celebrity worship, by starting a grassroots campaign to install America’s favorite redneck, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/conservatives-defend-duck-dynasty-star-phil-robertsons-anti-gay-remarks-1516160">Phil Robertson</a> and his Duck Dynasty clan, as the new ownership of the team.Surely, good standing Democrats should have no problem supporting a bunch of good old boys from the South. Frances Rice writes in the National Black Republicans Association site that, <a href="http://www.nationalblackrepublicans.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=pages.DYKKKKTerroristArmoftheDemocratParty">KKK Terrorist Arm of the Democratic Party</a>. &#8220;This ugly fact about the Democrat Party is detailed in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Reconstruction-Eric-Foner/dp/0060964316">A Short History of Reconstruction</a>, (Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc., 1990) by Dr. Eric Foner, the renowned liberal historian who is the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. Dr. Foner in his book explores the history of the origins of Ku Klux Klan and provides a chilling account of the atrocities committed by Democrats against Republicans, black and white.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/">Carole Emberton</a>, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today. Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Fast forward to today’s conductor <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/eric_holder_hate_crimes_and_his_people.html">Eric Holder</a>, of selective bigoted <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/032414.html">racism</a>, when describing &#8220;his people&#8221;, who &#8220;seem to get a pass on hate crime charges when they select whites for their blood sport&#8221;, one needs to question who the real haters are. David Risselada provides a valid assessment in the essay, <a href="http://patriotupdate.com/articles/hate-crimes-legislation-racial-identity-politics-institutional-racism-left/">Hate Crimes Legislation . . . Racial Identity Politics and the Institutional Racism of the Left</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The institutional racism that is built in our society is the responsibility of the left. Throughout history it has been the democrats who have supported segregation and slavery while continuously voting against civil rights legislation. Today, they attempt to hide their history through racial identity politics, and the creation of a system where inequality is the new equality. By creating laws based on racial preferences, the left is telling minorities that they believe they are not as capable as white men and therefore need their programs in order to stand a chance in the racist United States of America. This does little but reinforce hatred while attempting to justify black on white violence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time and in a place long ago, the Democratic Party defended the rights of the individual to associate with individuals of their choosing and speak their minds openly and without concern of censor. Since the conversion to ecumenical orthodoxy, the authoritarians that gave you the New Deal and the Great Society have a long record of creating their own hatred of Free Speech. The example of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?hp">New York Times</a> vicious attack on <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2014/04/24/cliven-bundy-controversial-remarks-full-context-video-with-transcript/">Cliven Bundy</a> illustrates another trumped-up incident ripe to exploit.The New American, author William F. Jasper makes the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Much of what Mr. Bundy is saying closely parallels what even many black leaders, authors and intellectuals — such as Prof. Walter Williams, Rev. C.L. Bryant, Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, Bill Cosby, Alveda King, Star Parker, and Alan Keyes — have been saying. But Cliven Bundy’s &#8220;sin&#8221; is that he is an elderly white man who is unschooled in traversing the minefield of political correctness — and he was careless in failing to make important distinctions and clarifications. He &#8220;sinned&#8221; by being born when he was born, and failing to keep up with the constantly changing terminology for ethnic designations. He still uses the terms &#8220;Negro,&#8221; &#8220;colored people,&#8221; and &#8220;Mexican,&#8221; instead of &#8220;black/ African American&#8221; or &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; — but then, race activists still argue amongst themselves concerning the &#8220;proper&#8221; ethnic label to apply to their lineage and group identity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When Senator <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/goodbye-free-speech-mass-dem-wants-government-to-monitor-speech-for-hate">Ed Markey</a>, D-Mass., introduces legislation called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2014-04-08_HateCrimes_Legislation1.pdf">Hate Crime Reporting Act of 2014</a>,&#8221; it is another partisan concerted attempt to silence voices and views entirely protected under the First Amendment, by monitoring radio, television and Internet speech. Can one say arbitrary and capricious, or will Big Brother now prey on any convenient and moving target to label anyone as a hate monger, that does not conform to the &#8220;PC&#8221; orthodoxy?</p>

<p>The excellent video from Ben Swann identifies in <a href="http://youtu.be/fTn6skhq-08">New &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; Bill Will Attempt To Control Speech On Internet, Radio and TV</a>, that the real objective is to censor the internet.</p>
<p>Well, this development should concern any student of inquiry, but the real world often fosters political threats that seem to be so implausible, if they were not true. The case of the arrest of <a href="http://vdare.com/posts/britain-quoting-winston-churchill-about-islam-is-now-an-arrestable-offense">Paul Weston</a> should alarm everyone. In the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/michael-coren-interviews-paul-weston-concerning-his-free-speech-arrest">Michael Coren interview or Mr. Weston</a>, the vanguard of British lunacy once again blazes new trails in the annals of hate speech. If quoting Winston Churchill is now a crime, what does that make Winnie?The British Bulldog is his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property — either as a child, a wife, or a concubine — must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Move over denial ridden Americans; the English have a talent in leading the civilized world in false guilt. For the rest of humankind, they are perceptive enough to admit that the normal human condition acknowledges <a href="http://batr.org/view_/060501.html">Discrimination as a Virtue</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Discrimination has been characterized as racism. Quite to the contrary, discrimination is an ally in the struggle to end bigotry and injustice. When Liberty is suppressed in a quest for equality; hatred and revulsion breeds, for different groups, cultures and ideologies. All attempts to force equal treatment are futile, even when severe penalties are imposed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Condemning a person, solely by his beliefs, bias and predisposition – that fanatical frenzy will surely bring about the fall of our cherished tradition of Free Speech. For those who fear Sharia Law, you had better be more concerned about the progressive despots, who are the model for imposed intolerance through a government, which hates everyone that refuses their Groupthink.</p>

</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">Never let a racial crisis go to waste is, I suppose, the credo of the Machiavellian mainstream media. Since the release of the Don Sterling audio, liberals haven’t missed a chance to play the race card for all its worth. One of the worst offenders is a New York <span style="font-style: italic;">Daily News</span> columnist named Harry Siegel, who — in a <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/sterling-slain-race-remains-article-1.1773457" target="_blank">piece</a> of pablum bearing a picture of NBA owners portrayed as Klansmen — bemoans the lack of Diversity™ in league ownership and management. Unfortunately for Siegy, his points, which start with the Klan hoods, only get worse from there.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A man with a conscience (malformed though it is), Siegel laments that the NBA is “a league where three-quarters of the players are black, but fewer than half the coaches and not even a fifth of the league office staff are black, as of October, 2013, and every majority team owner except Michael Jordan is white.” But there’s an easy remedy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Institute a quota ensuring that whites, and other races, get proportionate representation among NBA players.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This would make the league approximately 63 percent white, 17 percent Hispanic, 13 percent black and 6 percent Asian. The remaining one percent can be represented by Clint Eastwood’s empty chair on the sidelines, and we can throw in a primordial dwarf if it makes the Diversity™ didacts feel better.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And why not? Why should proportionality go only one way? The bias here lies in self-righteously bloviating about Diversity™ when whites dominate an area while acting as if you don’t even notice it when blacks do.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, liberals would say that the players have earned their positions. But how do we know the owners haven’t? After all, some individuals definitely seem to have a gift for building financial empires. This isn’t to say that every rich person makes his fortune through respectable means. Heck, some people even make millions dribbling a ball around.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But it seems that liberals, prejudiced to the core, only have a problem with it when the “wrong” groups succeed. With the contraception con spent, Barack Obama (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_be_upon_him_%28Islam%29" target="_blank">PBUH</a>) has used his Teleprompter recently to rail against the male/female wage gap — and he wasn’t talking about the one where young urban women earn 8 percent more than their male peers (because they’re 50 percent more likely to graduate college; I don’t think ol’ Barry mentions this gap, either). Libs could also cite how NBA owners are inordinately Jewish, but that narrative won’t work yet. And the highest-earning religious group in the nation is Hindus, but, last I heard, colleges weren’t schooling mush-head kids in “Hindu privilege.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But talking about those things might be “publicly toxic”; you know, in the sense that Siegel said he’s sure that Sterling is “not the only owner whose private thoughts are publicly toxic.” No doubt. And I’m certain this is limited to rich white NBA owners, or at least white people in general. It also occurs to me, however, that people can develop a tolerance for certain toxins, such as when black ex-basketball players suggest all-black leagues or black civil-rights hustlers <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm" target="_blank">call a cit</a>y “Hymietown.” And, in keeping with the toxicological principle “The dose makes the poison,” tolerance for toxins disgorged by whites stands at about .010 parts per million.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Then there are the millions, of dollars, that Siegel laments the NBA players are not getting, writing that theirs is a “league where the 360 or so athletes who, in fact, make the game, split its proceeds about 50-50 with ownership.” Note that he also dismissed the owners, who allegedly believe they make the game, as “[w]ealthy men…[who] think highly of their own contributions.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now, some might say that the fans make the game; after all, you earn zilch without a market. But what is Siegel’s point? Wouldn’t the proceeds split be much the same in the virtually all-white NHL? And how is that different from any corporation or successful business? A person doesn’t invest his heart and soul and risk capital in a venture without the carrot of a possibly handsome return; not even liberals such as Little Big Gulp (a.k.a. Michael Bloomberg), Warren Buffet and Donald Sterling do that.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">So it sounds as if Siegel is lamenting economic freedom, as if he’d prefer a Marxist model (this certainly would have the upside of not enriching men who dribble balls and pundits who dribble ideas). Of course, nothing is stopping the players from pooling their resources and trying to buy into their team.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But perhaps most telling about Siegel’s article is what could be akin to a Freudian slip. A recurrent theme of his is that “we” can feel good about ourselves for taking the principled stand against Sterling, but there is much work yet to do. He writes, “We can all take a moment and pat ourselves on the back for not being as horrible as this appalling old man,” and later, “Once we’re done feeling good about not being Sterling…,” it’s time to beat the Diversity™ drum. But he also self-righteously states that Sterling’s “obscene behavior…has been well documented” and asks, “how could this have gone on for so long?”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What this gets at is the phoniness of the left. Let’s be clear on something: the “we” here isn’t me. It’s not most of you readers, the Heritage Foundation, Catholic Church or Southern Baptist Convention.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is the left.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Notoriously liberal Mark Cuban, who now calls Sterling “abhorrent,” said in 2009, “I like Donald. He plays by his own rules.&#8221; (Translation: a lib who becomes a liability to the cause is “abhorrent.” A lib who is getting away with it “plays by his own rules.”) Black actor Leon Isaac Kennedy called Sterling “a prince among men.” The NAACP gave him an award and was set to bestow another. And ex-NBA commissioner David Stern, who some libs now criticize for not only tolerating the owner but even rewarding him, is, like Sterling, a Democrat donor.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The “we,” libs, is you.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It’s not conservatives. It’s not white people. It’s <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">You anointed yourselves arbiters and overseers of acceptable racial commentary; “racism” is your hang-up, your defined One Deadly Sin, your great litmus test. Don’t blame “society” — upholding <span style="font-style: italic;">your</span>principles is <span style="font-style: italic;">your</span> responsibility.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">So most of the lib outrage over “racism” is, when not downright phony, motivated by selectively triggered emotion. It’s a ploy used to tear down tradition and traditionalists on specious grounds and win the culture war. It’s not for lib-enablers, such as late Senator Robert Byrd, who’d been in the KKK; blacks such a Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton; Bill Clinton with his Obama-coffee remark; or fat cats who make big donations — until it’s time to throw them under the bus.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As for Siegel, if he’s so concerned about Diversity™, perhaps he could turn his columnist slot over to a minority. After all, the vast majority of columnists are white, Siegy, and you wouldn’t want some future writer to have to lament, “how could this have gone on for so long?”</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">America&#8217;s founders, largely distrustful of centralized power, created several checks and balances into the U.S. Constitution to help insure that one person, or one group of people, would not be able to unilaterally exert his or their will over the American citizenry. First, the federal government itself was divided into three separate and distinct branches&#8211;each holding the capability (and responsibility) to check the power of the other. Second, the Bill of Rights was made part of the Constitution for the protection of individual liberties. Third, the &#8220;free and independent states&#8221; of the nation retained their sovereignty and independence after the central government was created (by the states), with the Tenth Amendment specifically recognizing their authority and jurisdiction over matters not directly delegated to the federal government.
</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It was also assumed that the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion would help the citizenry be sufficiently informed and inspired to keep the would-be despots at bay. And, of course, &#8220;We the People&#8221; are recognized as being the ultimate guardians of liberty by the recognition that &#8220;to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.&#8221; (Declaration) The &#8220;consent of the governed&#8221; was given teeth by the constitutional recognition of the people&#8217;s right to wield the power of the voting booth, the jury box, and, as a last resort, the cartridge box.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">
What has become increasingly obvious to a large segment of the American populace is the complete unwillingness of the national media to hold the federal government accountable. Neither do America&#8217;s pulpits provide the moral leadership necessary to maintain good government. The freedom of the press and religion accomplish precious little today in the safeguarding of liberty. And it is also absolutely clear that the three branches of government in Washington, D.C., adamantly refuse to use the constitutional obligations placed upon them to hold the federal government in check.</p>
<p>The latter was made crystal clear by a recent decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. Here is the report:</p>
<p>&#8220;A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court means the federal government now has an open door to &#8216;detain as a threat to national security anyone viewed as a troublemaker,&#8217; according to critics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The high court this week refused to review an appeals court decision that said the president and U.S. military can arrest and indefinitely detain individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The firm of William J. Olson, P.C., which filed a friend-of-the court brief asking the court to step in, noted that not a single justice dissented from the denial of the request for review.<br />
&#8216;The court ducked, having no appetite to confront both political parties in order to protect the citizens from military detention,&#8217; the legal team said in a statement to WND. &#8216;The government has won, creating a tragic moment for the people&#8211;and what will someday be viewed as an embarrassment for the court.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The report continues: &#8220;The controversial provision authorizes the military, under presidential authority, to arrest, kidnap, detain without trial and hold indefinitely American citizens thought to &#8216;represent an enduring security threat to the United States.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Journalist Chris Hedges was among the plaintiffs charging the law could be used to target journalists who report on terror-related issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend-of-the-court brief submitted in the case stated: &#8216;The central question now before this court is whether the federal judiciary will stand idly by while Congress and the president establish the legal framework for the establishment of a police state and the subjugation of the American citizenry through the threat of indefinite military arrest and detention, without the right to counsel, the right to confront one&#8217;s accusers, or the right to trial.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The brief was submitted to the Supreme Court by attorneys with the U.S.<br />
Justice Foundation of Ramona, California; Friedman Harfenist Kraut &amp; Perlstein of Lake Success, New York; and William J. Olson, P.C. of Vienna, Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amici Curiae of the brief included U.S. Congressman Steve Stockman, Virginia Delegate Bob Marshall, Virginia Senator Dick Black, Gun Owners of America, Downsize DC Foundation, Western Journalism Center, The Lincoln Institute for Research and Education, Tenth Amendment Center, Policy Analysis Center, Constitution Party National Committee, Professor Jerome Aumente, and yours truly, among others.</p>
<p>See the brief here:</p>
<p><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flawandfreedom.com%2Fsite%2Fconstitutional%2FHedges%2520v%2520Obama%2520amicus%2520brief.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTa5mh8FcY-Hmq-HQITVpdkOFp0A" target="_blank">Amicus Brief</a></p>
<p>The WND report goes on to say: &#8220;The 2012 NDAA was fast-tracked through the U.S. Senate, with no time for discussion or amendments, while most Americans were distracted by the scandal surrounding A&amp;E&#8217;s troubles with &#8216;Duck Dynasty&#8217; star Phil Robertson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty-five of 100 senators voted in favor of the new version of the NDAA, which had already been quietly passed by the House of Representatives. [Disgustingly, Montana's only U.S. House member, Republican Steve Daines, who purports himself to be a staunch conservative, voted for the indefinite detention provision of the NDAA, as did Montana's two Democrat Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester. How did your congressman and senators vote? In my opinion, this is a monumentally-important vote, and a vote granting this unconstitutional power to the military and federal police agencies is inexcusable and demonstrates how both Democrats and Republicans will unite together to dismantle the constitutional protections of the American people in the name of "national security."]</p>
<p>&#8220;Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, and others filed a lawsuit in 2012 against the Obama administration to challenge the legality of an earlier version of the NDAA.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, and its successors, that drew a lawsuit by Hedges, Daniel Ellsberg, Jennifer Bolen, Noam Chomsky, Alex O&#8217;Brien, Kai Warg All, Brigitta Jonsottir and the group U.S. Day of Rage. Many of the plaintiffs are authors or reporters who stated that the threat of indefinite detention by the U.S. military already had altered their activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s clearly unconstitutional,&#8217; Hedges said of the bill. &#8216;It is a huge and egregious assault against our democracy. It overturns over 200 years of law, which has kept the military out of domestic policing.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hedges is a former foreign correspondent for the New York Times and was part of a team of reporters awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 2002 for the paper&#8217;s coverage of global terrorism.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the complete WND report here:</p>
<p><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnd.com%2F2014%2F04%2Fsupreme-court-green-lights-detention-of-americans%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGG_1pnwmbTBNtZR8XzmugazfhV1g" target="_blank">Supreme Court Green Lights Detention Of Americans</a></p>
<p>Remember that it was Republican President George W. Bush and a Republican U.S. House and Senate that shackled the American people with the USA Patriot Act, the Department of Homeland Security&#8211;along with the rest of the gargantuan police state apparatus under which the people of the United States are now being forced to live. And it is Democrat President Barack Obama and a Democrat U.S. Senate&#8211;along with a Republican U.S. House&#8211;that continues to expand the reach of this police state. One thing that both Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals agree on is the construction and implementation of a police state. Under the rubric of &#8220;national security&#8221; or &#8220;law and order,&#8221; the Bill of Rights is being systematically and deliberately expunged by both sides of the political aisle.</p>
<p>And now we know the judicial branch of government in Washington, D.C., also refuses to hold the executive and legislative branches of government in check&#8211;as if we needed more evidence. Both Republican-appointed and Democrat-appointed justices refused to say a word condemning this draconian abuse of power within the NDAA. By so doing, the Supreme Court showed itself unwilling to stand in between the liberties of the American people and an ever-burgeoning police state.</p>
<p>In fact, when it comes to holding the government in DC in check, when does the Supreme Court ever intervene? Hardly ever! If it is a dispute between the states and the federal government or between individuals and the federal government, SCOTUS almost always rules in favor of DC.</p>
<p>Once-in-awhile, one or the other branch of government (including the judicial branch) in DC will be willing to protect constitutional liberties from another branch of government in DC, but such instances are the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>And since the liberties of the American people have few friends in the national media or in the country&#8217;s pulpits, the protection of our freedoms has quickly come down to the states, the local media (yes, some local media is still friendly to freedom), county sheriffs, and the people ourselves.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a huge momentum building among State legislatures to begin pushing back against the overreach of Washington, D.C. For example, the State of Texas is squaring off against the BLM over tens of thousands of acres along the Red River border of Texas and Oklahoma, and the State of Utah has already passed legislation claiming more than 30 million acres currently controlled by the federal government. Here is an excerpt from a Breitbart.com report:</p>
<p>&#8220;Utah Governor Gary Herbert (R), earlier this year, signed the Transfer of Public Lands Act. This new state law calls upon the federal government to turn over control of more than 30 million acres to the State.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plus, more and more county sheriffs are beginning to stand against federal encroachments. Read this report:</p>
<p><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rangemagazine.com%2Farchives%2Fstories%2Fwinter03%2Fbadge-v-badge.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEZTFohoEVwzXRUifSwtx6iL-klw" target="_blank">Badge VS. Badge</a></p>
<p>And, of course, just recently it was &#8220;We the People&#8221; standing against a brutish, totalitarian-style federal assault against the Bundy family in Bunkerville, Nevada. And among the brave souls at Bunkerville were State and local officials and even county sheriffs. And I was there, too. Here is the video of my message to, and prayer service for, the Oath Keepers and militia on the ground there in Bunkerville:</p>
<p><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchuckbaldwinlive.com%2FArticles%2Ftabid%2F109%2FID%2F1159%2FBundy-Ranch-Sermon-Prayer.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDiS-y9m7dtpYBked5Ghgqc6fYDA" target="_blank">Sermon &amp; Prayer At Bundy Ranch</a></p>
<p>As the three branches of government in Washington, D.C., become less and less accountable to the checks and balances assigned them by the Constitution, it is going to require that the states, county sheriffs, and people ourselves become more and more engaged in pushing back against federal overreach and abuse of power.</p>

<p>Few will dispute that careerist politicians often demonstrate psychopathic behavior. In the article, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/who-controls-our-government-the-psychopathic-corporate-elites-of-america/5371627?print=1">Who Controls our Government? The Psychopathic Corporate Elites of America</a>, Richard Gale and Dr. Gary Null attempt to answer several fundamental questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Is the problem, therefore, we the people? Are we at fault for having been seduced by those in power to sell us blank bill of goods, drugs, products and policies that are more harmful than beneficial? Are we at fault for having deceived our selves by being convinced that their illusion is the truth? Or is the elite, the best and brightest in Wall Street, Washington and throughout the top stories of the multinational corporate networks, the real obstacle to a promising future for all? Are the oligarchic elite, including corporate Democrats and corporate Republicans in all branches of government, not in fact a special breed of psychopath with no moral compass, striving solely to maintain their power, control and wealth? In this article we explore this phenomena with two leading experts on the psychopathic nature of our CEOs, business leaders and politicians who rule America from their residences on Psycho Street.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What may be revealing to the average person is that many of the same sociopathic characteristics exhibited in the policy manipulators exist in the general population. Martha Stout, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist and former Harvard Medical school instructor and author of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sociopath-Next-Door-Martha-Stout/dp/0767915828/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398343919&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+sociopath+nextdoor">The Sociopath Next Door</a>. The article, <a href="http://louisianavoice.com/2013/10/10/psychopaths-and-sociopaths-share-many-characteristics-seem-to-coincide-eerily-with-louisiana-officials-persona/">Psychopaths and sociopaths share many characteristics: seem to coincide</a>, cites she &#8220;estimates that one in 25 people, 4 percent of the population, are sociopathic. Dr. Stout describes sociopaths as those who, through grand schemes of contrivance, manipulation and deceit, seek to undermine and manipulate simply because they can.&#8221;The tendencies for government officials, who prefer the designation authorities, project their dictatorial attitude upon a compliant public. &#8220;Most disturbing of all, Stout says at least six out of 10 people &#8220;will blindly obey an official-looking authority to the bitter end.&#8221;</p>
<p>The essay, <a href="http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2012/01/age-of-the-psychopaths/">Age of the Psychopaths</a>, by Michael Colhaze links the operations of the power elite to an authoritarian culture, which ordinary citizen willingly obey.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As Prof. Robert Hare coined it so simply yet fittingly: Serial killer psychopaths ruin families. Corporate psychopaths ruin societies.</p>
<p>Particularly if the latter have aligned themselves, due to bonds of blood and faith, with the political psychopaths, which means in fact that a whole country has fallen into the hands of men who normally would be locked away in a mental hospital. What is more, under the cover of an imaginary terrorist threat illegal laws have been promulgated that have curtailed the guaranteed democratic liberties. Crowned by the so-called NDAA, a Christmas present signed by the Neocon lackey, does the whole body signify a legal garrote that has turned the USA into a virtual police state.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This malady of assimilation and submission is the result of decades of cultural engineering and social propaganda, going back to the application of <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Propaganda/Propaganda_Bernays.html">Edward Bernays’</a> psychological mind control, upon a naïve citizenry.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;No serious sociologist any longer believes that the voice of the people expresses any divine or specially wise and lofty idea. The voice of the people expresses the mind of the people, and that mind is made up for it by the group leaders in whom it believes and by those persons who understand the manipulation of public opinion. It is composed of inherited prejudices and symbols and clichés and verbal formulas supplied to them by the leaders.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the book, <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/p8230.html">Why People Obey the Law</a>, Tom R. Tyler concludes with the following erroneous assumption that an intrinsic duty to obey, exists.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why People Obey the Law makes the argument that the relationship between the members of groups, organizations, and societies and the authorities and institutions which govern them need not be based upon an instrumental exchange of rewards or be a threat-based approach to social control. It is also possible to engage the values of the population, which leads to a self-regulatory stance toward governance, in which people voluntarily defer to authorities and institutions because they view doing so as part of the obligation they have to their leaders.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How can governance ever be self-regulating when the entire system operates under a delusional mental illness? Establishment idiots that rationalize compliance, when government &#8220;public servants&#8221; turn into despotic tyrants, usually are timid cowards or seek to extract some kind of perceived benefit from their psychopathic masters. These &#8220;so called&#8221; civic employees are perpetuating the political psychosis of the cognizance dissident society.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/Low-Information-Voter-Thoughts.jpg" alt="Low-Information-Voter-Thoughts.jpg" width="560" /></p>
<p>Then factor in the deranged &#8220;true-believers&#8221; who bow down to an absurd reading of scripture. In <a href="http://andrewerrington.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/romans-13-1-7/">Romans 13:1–7 and the problem of bad governments</a>, Deacons and Dragons writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think there is the basis here for active Christian resistance to governments that have gone profoundly wrong. When a government has so abandoned its task of enacting right that it can no longer be seen to be an &#8220;authority&#8221;, then there is, I suggest, room for resistance to be the right action. However, I say this very cautiously, because the far more obvious approach to this kind of situation in the Bible is to suffer. The Christian martyrs in Revelation suffer under unjust rulers; they don’t try to blow them up. Nevertheless, I think there is more to be said than this. O’Donovan reminds us that John of Salisbury, in the twelfth century, spoke of the duty of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannicide">tyrannicide</a>! This, I tentatively suggest, is how we might understand Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s involvement in the attempted assassination of Hitler.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, this drastic approach offers little hope, when the institutional technocrats are administrating their demonic edicts and imposing draconian burdens on the serfs, under this new feudal system of oppression and theft.</p>
<p>The absurdity in obeying an illegitimate authority should be self-evident to any rational person. However, there are so few stable and sane individuals, who exercise conduct by conscience, that the sociopaths can easily control the masses, by keeping their autocratic officials following orders.</p>
<p>The perfect example of government hooligan goons from the <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/041414.html">Bureau of Land Management</a> was unmistakably on display at the Bundy Ranch recently. In spite of this illegitimate storm trooper federal deployment, <a href="http://www.teapartytribune.com/2014/04/23/texas-ag-greg-abbott-to-blm-come-and-take-it/">Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott</a> questions the BLM’s authority to seize 90,000 acres belonging to Texas landholders along the Texas/Oklahoma line.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am deeply concerned about the notion that the Bureau of Land Management believes the federal government has the authority to swoop in and take land that has been owned and cultivated by Texas landowners for generations,&#8221; General Abbott wrote. &#8220;The BLM’s newly asserted claims to land along the Red River threaten to upset long-settled private property rights and undermine fundamental principles—including the rule of law—that form the foundation of our democracy. Yet, the BLM has failed to disclose either its full intentions or the legal justification for its proposed actions. Decisions of this magnitude must not be made inside a bureaucratic black box.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Before anyone gets excited about pushing back the District of Criminals Federales, the true and lasting test, requires that internal non-compliance must start and gain momentum within each level of government agencies. The career climbers operate under the psychopath principle to attain a confirmed reliability position in their respective sociopathic organization. Making your bones is an important ritual in any crime syndicate.</p>
<p>All the time the dumb down public pays tribute to the forces that use psychological <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/021014.html">mind control</a> and <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/071413.html">law enforcement</a> brute force to subdue any dissident elements that dare resist. Refusing to bow to an illicit system is a sure sign of defiance. Institutionalizing such threats in a government funded mental asylum may seem appropriate to the &#8220;PC&#8221; enabler, but why waste the money when a &#8220;double tap&#8221; gun shoot can eliminate the opposition quickly.This kind of thinking is operationally sound within the perverted and sociopathic agency culture that most government exponents support. There is a reason why the public is stupid. As the standard of living deteriorates even more and the prospect of genuine individual liberty becomes but a faint recollection in the memory of the nation, the average peon becomes but chattel to the establishment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.caseyresearch.com/articles/sociopathy-running-us-part-two">Doug Casey</a>, of economic and social commentary renown offers this deduction about the sociopaths running the U.S.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Conversely, statism and collectivism, by restricting liberty, tend to reward stupidity. Remember that political leaders are oriented toward controlling other people; they&#8217;re clever about it, but they&#8217;re basically stupid about the rest of reality. Nonetheless, their animal shrewdness is enough for them to gain and keep power over others. The immediate and direct consequences of that political power are gratifying for those who have it; the indirect and delayed consequences, however, are disastrous for everyone.</p>
<p>But wait. It sounds like stupidity is related to evil. Which it is. Stupidity is a signpost of evil. It&#8217;s why it often takes a while, when things are going badly, to determine whether you&#8217;re dealing with a knave or just a fool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Almost begs the question does the American public love evil, since they demonstrate so emphatically that they support this corrupt sociopathic establishment.</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">So, what do we have here? In Libya, in Syria, and elsewhere the United States has been on the same side as the al-Qaeda types. But not in Ukraine. That’s the good news. The bad news is that in Ukraine the United States is on the same side as the neo-Nazi types, who – taking time off from parading around with their swastika-like symbols and calling for the death of Jews, Russians and Communists – on May 2 burned down a trade-union building in Odessa, killing scores of people and sending hundreds to hospital; many of the victims were beaten or shot when they tried to flee the flames and smoke; ambulances were blocked from reaching the wounded. Try and find an American mainstream media entity that has made a serious attempt to capture the horror.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And how did this latest example of American foreign-policy exceptionalism come to be? One starting point that can be considered is what former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Robert Gates says in his recently published memoir: “When the Soviet Union was collapsing in late 1991, [Defense Secretary Dick Cheney] wanted to see the dismemberment not only of the Soviet Union and the Russian empire but of Russia itself, so it could never again be a threat to the rest of the world.” That can serve as an early marker for the new cold war while the corpse of the old one was still warm. Soon thereafter, NATO began to surround Russia with military bases, missile sites, and NATO members, while yearning for perhaps the most important part needed to complete the circle – Ukraine.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In February of this year, US State Department officials, undiplomatically, joined anti-government protesters in the capital city of Kiev, handing out encouragement and food, from which emanated the infamous leaked audio tape between the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, and the State Department’s Victoria Nuland, former US ambassador to NATO and former State Department spokesperson for Hillary Clinton. Their conversation dealt with who should be running the new Ukraine government after the government of Viktor Yanukovich was overthrown; their most favored for this position being one Arseniy Yatsenuk.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">My dear, and recently departed, Washington friend, John Judge, liked to say that if you want to call him a “conspiracy theorist” you have to call others “coincidence theorists”. Thus it was by the most remarkable of coincidences that Arseniy Yatsenuk did indeed become the new prime minister. He could very soon be found in private meetings and public press conferences with the president of the United States and the Secretary-General of NATO, as well as meeting with the soon-to-be new owners of Ukraine, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, preparing to impose their standard financial shock therapy. The current protestors in Ukraine don’t need PHDs in economics to know what this portends. They know about the impoverishment of Greece, Spain, <em>et al</em>. They also despise the new regime for its overthrow of their democratically-elected government, whatever its shortcomings. But the American media obscures these motivations by almost always referring to them simply as “pro-Russian”.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">An exception, albeit rather unemphasized, was the April 17 <em>Washington Post</em> which reported from Donetsk that many of the eastern Ukrainians whom the author interviewed said the unrest in their region was driven by fear of “economic hardship” and the IMF austerity plan that will make their lives even harder: “At a most dangerous and delicate time, just as it battles Moscow for hearts and minds across the east, the pro-Western government is set to initiate a shock therapy of economic measures to meet the demands of an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Arseniy Yatsenuk, it should be noted, has something called the Arseniy Yatsenuk Foundation. If you go to the <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #02588d;" href="http://openukraine.org/en/about/partners" target="_blank">foundation’s website</a> you will see the logos of the foundation’s “partners”.  Among these partners we find NATO, the National Endowment for Democracy, the US State Department, Chatham House (Royal Institute of International Affairs in the UK), the German Marshall Fund (a think tank founded by the German government in honor of the US Marshall Plan), as well as a couple of international banks. Is any comment needed?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Getting away with supporting al-Qaeda and Nazi types may be giving US officials the idea that they can say or do anything they want in their foreign policy. In a May 2 press conference, President Obama, referring to Ukraine and the NATO Treaty, said: “We’re united in our unwavering Article 5 commitment to the security of our NATO allies”. (Article 5 states: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all.”) Did the president forget that Ukraine is not (yet) a member of NATO? And in the same press conference, the president referred to the “duly elected government in Kyiv (Kiev)”, when in fact it had come to power via a coup and then proceeded to establish a new regime in which the vice-premier, minister of defense, minister of agriculture, and minister of environment, all belonged to far-right neo-Nazi parties.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The pure awfulness of the Ukrainian right-wingers can scarcely be exaggerated. In early March, the leader of Pravy Sektor (Right Sector) called upon his comrades, the infamous Chechnyan terrorists, to carry out further terrorist actions in Russia.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">There may be one important difference between the old Cold War and the new one. The American people, as well as the world, can not be as easily brainwashed as they were during the earlier period.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Over the course of a decade, in doing the research for my first books and articles on US foreign policy, one of the oddities to me of the Cold War was how often the Soviet Union seemed to know what the United States was really up to, even if the American people didn’t. Every once in a while in the 1950s to 70s a careful reader would notice a two- or three-inch story in the <em>New York Times</em> on the bottom of some distant inside page, reporting that <em>Pravda</em> or <em>Izvestia</em> had claimed that a recent coup or political assassination in Africa or Asia or Latin America had been the work of the CIA; the<em>Times</em> might add that a US State Department official had labeled the story as “absurd”. And that was that; no further details were provided; and none were needed, for how many American readers gave it a second thought? It was just more commie propaganda. Who did they think they were fooling? This ignorance/complicity on the part of the mainstream media allowed the United States to get away with all manner of international crimes and mischief.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It was only in the 1980s when I began to do the serious research that resulted in my first book, which later became <em>Killing Hope</em>, that I was able to fill in the details and realize that the United States had indeed masterminded that particular coup or assassination, and many other coups and assassinations, not to mention countless bombings, chemical and biological warfare, perversion of elections, drug dealings, kidnapings, and much more that had not appeared in the American mainstream media or schoolbooks. (And a significant portion of which was apparently unknown to the Soviets as well.)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But there have been countless revelations about US crimes in the past two decades. Many Americans and much of the rest of the planet have become educated. They’re much more skeptical of American proclamations and the fawning media.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">President Obama recently declared: “The strong condemnation that it’s received from around the world indicates the degree to which Russia is on the wrong side of history on this.”  Marvelous … coming from the man who partners with jihadists and Nazis and has waged war against seven nations. In the past half century is there any country whose foreign policy has received more bitter condemnation than the United States? If the United States is not on the wrong side of history, it may be only in the history books published by the United States.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Barack Obama, like virtually all Americans, likely believes that the Soviet Union, with perhaps the sole exception of the Second World War, was consistently on the wrong side of history in its foreign policy as well as at home. Yet, in a survey conducted by an independent Russian polling center this past January, and reported in the <em>Washington Post</em> in April, 86 percent of respondents older than 55 expressed regret for the Soviet Union’s collapse; 37 percent of those aged 25 to 39 did so. (Similar poll results have been reported regularly since the demise of the Soviet Union. This is from<em>USA Today</em> in 1999: “When the Berlin Wall crumbled, East Germans imagined a life of freedom where consumer goods were abundant and hardships would fade. Ten years later, a remarkable 51% say they were happier with communism.”)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Or as the new Russian proverb put it: “Everything the Communists said about Communism was a lie, but everything they said about capitalism turned out to be the truth.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">A week before the above <em>Post</em> report in April the newspaper printed an article about happiness around the world, which contains the following charming lines: “Worldwide polls show that life seems better to older people – except in Russia.” … “Essentially, life under President Vladimir Putin is one continuous downward spiral into despair.” … “What’s going on in Russia is deep unhappiness.” … “In Russia, the only thing to look forward to is death’s sweet embrace.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">No, I don’t think it was meant to be any kind of satire. It appears to be a scientific study, complete with graphs, but it reads like something straight out of the 1950s.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The views Americans hold of themselves and other societies are not necessarily more distorted than the views found amongst people elsewhere in the world, but the Americans’ distortion can lead to much more harm. Most Americans and members of Congress have convinced themselves that the US/NATO encirclement of Russia is benign – we are, after all, the Good Guys – and they don’t understand why Russia can’t see this.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The first Cold War, from Washington’s point of view, was often designated as one of “containment”, referring to the US policy of preventing the spread of communism around the world, trying to block<em>the very idea</em> of communism or socialism. There’s still some leftover from that – see Venezuela and Cuba, for example – but the new Cold War can be seen more in terms of a military strategy. Washington thinks in terms of who could pose a barrier to the ever-expanding empire adding to its bases and other military necessities.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Whatever the rationale, it’s imperative that the United States suppress any lingering desire to bring Ukraine (and Georgia) into the NATO alliance. Nothing is more likely to bring large numbers of Russian boots onto the Ukrainian ground than the idea that Washington wants to have NATO troops right on the Russian border and in spitting distance of the country’s historic Black Sea naval base in Crimea.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">The myth of Soviet expansionism</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">One still comes across references in the mainstream media to Russian “expansionism” and “the Soviet empire”, in addition to that old favorite “the evil empire”. These terms stem largely from erstwhile Soviet control of Eastern European states. But was the creation of these satellites following World War II an act of imperialism or expansionism? Or did the decisive impetus lie elsewhere?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Within the space of less than 25 years, Western powers had invaded Russia three times – the two world wars and the “Intervention” of 1918-20 – inflicting some 40 million casualties in the two wars alone. To carry out these invasions, the West had used Eastern Europe as a highway. Should it be any cause for wonder that after World War II the Soviets wanted to close this highway down? In almost any other context, Americans would have no problem in seeing this as an act of self defense. But in the context of the Cold War such thinking could not find a home in mainstream discourse.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The Baltic states of the Soviet Union – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – were not part of the highway and were frequently in the news because of their demands for more autonomy from Moscow, a story “natural” for the American media. These articles invariably reminded the reader that the “once independent” Baltic states were invaded in 1939 by the Soviet Union, incorporated as republics of the USSR, and had been “occupied” ever since. Another case of brutal Russian imperialism. Period. History etched in stone.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The three countries, it happens, were part of the Russian empire from 1721 up to the Russian Revolution of 1917, in the midst of World War I. When the war ended in November 1918, and the Germans had been defeated, the victorious Allied nations (US, Great Britain, France, <em>et al.</em>) permitted/encouraged the German forces to remain in the Baltics for a full year to crush the spread of Bolshevism there; this, with ample military assistance from the Allied nations. In each of the three republics, the Germans installed collaborators in power who declared their independence from the new Bolshevik state which, by this time, was so devastated by the World War, the revolution, and the civil war prolonged by the Allies’ intervention, that it had no choice but to accept the <em>fait accompli</em>. The rest of the fledgling Soviet Union had to be saved.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">To at least win some propaganda points from this unfortunate state of affairs, the Soviets announced that they were relinquishing the Baltic republics “voluntarily” in line with their principles of anti-imperialism and self-determination. But is should not be surprising that the Soviets continued to regard the Baltics as a rightful part of their nation or that they waited until they were powerful enough to reclaim the territory.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Then we had Afghanistan. Surely this was an imperialist grab. But the Soviet Union had lived next door to Afghanistan for more than 60 years without gobbling it up. And when the Russians invaded in 1979, the key motivation was the United States involvement in a movement, largely Islamic, to topple the Afghan government, which was friendly to Moscow. The Soviets could not have been expected to tolerate a pro-US, anti-communist government on its border any more than the United States could have been expected to tolerate a pro-Soviet, communist government in Mexico.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, if the rebel movement took power it likely would have set up a fundamentalist Islamic government, which would have been in a position to proselytize the numerous Muslims in the Soviet border republics.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“According to the evidence that I’ve seen …Odessa was a giant false flag operation. It… was one of those staged massacres that the pro-Western forces from Bosnia to Kosovo, now Ukraine, excel at staging, intended to draw Russia to overreact and commit military forces … I believe that the fact that they are willing to stage such a horrendous atrocity shows the depth of their desperation at this point.”</em></p>
<p>– <strong>Nebojsa Malic</strong>, political analyst, Russia Today</p>
<p><em>“Not under foreign skies<br />
Nor under foreign wings protected -<br />
I shared all this with my own people<br />
There, where misfortune had abandoned us.”</em></p>
<p>– “Requiem” – <strong>Anna Akhmatova</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Photos of the victims of the Odessa fire which have been circulating on the<a href="http://ersieesist.livejournal.com/813.html?nojs=">Internet</a> have cast doubt on the official version of events. It’s now clear that many of the anti-junta activists who occupied the Trade Unions House were neither burned to death nor died of smoke inhalation, but were savagely shot at point-blank range by agents and thugs who had infiltrated the building to kill as many of the occupants as possible, burn the corpses, and then slip away without notice. Some of the victims–like a young woman who was eight months pregnant –were strangled with an electrical chord and left slumped backwards over her desk in a room that shows no sign of fire or smoke damage. In another case, a woman was stripped naked from the waste down, raped, killed, and set ablaze.</p>
<p>In still other cases, victims with bullet-holes through their skulls, had flammable fluid dumped on their heads and were incinerated, leaving a charred head atop a corpse whose clothes were untouched by fire. The sloppily-executed killing-spree proves that the fire was not the result of a spontaneous clash between pro and anti-Kiev demonstrators, but a carefully planned black-op that likely involved foreign Intel agencies working hand-in-hand with the fascist junta government in Kiev. Did we mention that the CIA has taken up residence in the Ukrainian capital? Here’s the scoop from the AFP:</p>
<p>“Dozens of specialists from the US Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation are advising the Ukrainian government … helping Kiev end the rebellion in the east of Ukraine and set up a functioning security structure…” (<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/cia-fbi-agents-advising-ukraine-government-report-101508429.html">CIA, FBI agents ‘advising Ukraine government</a>: report, AFP)</p>
<p>We all know about the CIA’s energetic efforts to create a “functioning security structure” in nations around the world. The CIA’s presence in Ukraine suggests that the US was either actively involved in the Odessa incident or knows who was. Either way, there should be an independent investigation before the case is referred to the ICC for prosecution.</p>
<p>The rampage in Odessa is part a broader strategy to provoke Moscow into a military confrontation. US war planners want to draw Putin into a conflict to justify NATO expansion, block further EU-Russian economic integration, and facilitate the “pivot to Asia.” The victims in this tragedy were sacrificed to advance Washington’s imperial ambitions and to establish US global hegemony. Obama has repeatedly reiterated his unwavering support for the crackdown on dissidents in the east. In a Rose Garden press conference just days ago, the president applauded the military attack on civilians saying, “The Ukrainian government has shown remarkable restraint throughout this whole process.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the Odessa graveyards are now full of people who can attest to the great restraint of the junta government that Obama so admires.</p>
<p>The coverage of the Odessa massacre by the western media is as bad as any in recent memory. The giant news conglomerates no longer make any attempt to pretend they’re anything other propaganda organs for the State. Even by that low standard, the coverage has been abysmal. Here’s a typical summary from an article on the liberal website, Huffington Post.</p>
<p>“Police said the deadly fire broke out in a trade union building, but did not give details on how it started. Earlier, police said at least three people had died in a clash between the two sides in the city of 1 million.</p>
<p>According to Ukrainian news reports, the pro-Kiev demonstrators broke up an encampment of Moscow supporters outside the trade union building. The latter took refuge in the building, which then caught fire.<br />
Odessa police spokesman Volodymyr Shasbliyenko told AP the fire apparently was caused by Molotov cocktails. He had no further details or identities of the victims.” (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/02/police-38-dead-in-protes_n_5255399.html">Odessa Building Fire Kills Dozens</a>, AP)</p>
<p>The author deliberately misleads his readers about what really took place. The fire did not “break out” in a trade union building. It was started. There’s no debate about this. There’s video footage of the whole incident and tons of eyewitness reports. Right sector goons started the fire by throwing Molotov cocktails through the windows. It’s all on tape.</p>
<p>Second, the “pro-Kiev demonstrators” (did not) “break up an encampment of Moscow supporters outside the trade union building…which then caught fire.” This is nonsense. The fascist extremists burned down the tent city, chased the activists into the building, barricaded the exits, and then set the building on fire with the obvious intention of killing the people inside. Again, there is no debate about this. It’s all on video. The US media is involved in a massive cover up, mainly because a investigation would undoubtedly point to US involvement. This is why none of the major news organizations are covering an incident which would normally be headline news. Odessa is unique blend of Waco and Columbine, a combo that editors typically use to boost sagging ratings by exploiting public empathy and outrage. Only this time, the media has minimized its coverage and refused to report on a story that would probably lead straight to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<p>While the New York Times has been widely criticized for publishing fake photos of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal wins the trophy for absolute worst coverage. In a piece titled “Deadly Ukraine Fire Likely Sparked by Rebels, Government Says”, the WSJ pushes the improbable theory that the anti-coup activists inside the building actually burned the building down themselves, a pathetic attempt to blame the victims of a ruthless government crackdown. Here’s an excerpt from the article:</p>
<p>“The fire began from the roof. There were extremists there, we found casings and firearms,” Mr. Chebotar said. “But something unexpected happened; their Molotov cocktails fell, and ignited the higher floors of the building.” (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304831304579545093207787978?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304831304579545093207787978.html">Deadly Ukraine Fire Likely Sparked by Rebels</a>, Wall Street Journal)</p>
<p>Utterly ridiculous. Are the editors of the WSJ aware of the fact that footage of the Neo Nazis throwing Molotov cocktails at the building are all over the Internet?</p>
<p>The article, of course, fails to explain how many of the people inside the building were either shot or strangled to death. Nor does the author speculate on why the police stood by while people hurled themselves from windows to escape the fire or were savagely beaten by right wing extremists on the pavement in front of the building. Instead, the WSJ tries to provide a plausible excuse for the one part of the story it chooses to focus on as if “who started the fire” can be separated from other important details. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the 40 victims of the incident were killed in a homicidal rampage that was perpetrated by Obama’s new friends in Kiev. No amount of whitewash is going to hide that one glaring fact. Here’s how Serbian historian and political analyst, Nebosja Malic, summed it up:</p>
<p>“According to all the evidence that I have seen, the entire thing in Odessa was a giant false flag operation. It was a provocation, it was one of those stage massacres that the pro-Western forces from Bosnia to Kosovo, now Ukraine excel at staging, intended to draw Russia to overreact…</p>
<p>“We have proof that the West is instigating this. And just the other day, Catherine Ashton, the EU’s commissioner for foreign policy, pretty much gave a green light to the extremists from Kiev. She pretty much said they had a right to establish law and order within the borders of the country. I would say that the EU has blood on its hands, especially Catherine Ashton. It’s the same thing they did in Yugoslavia in the 90s, when they started encouraging radicals, extremists, secessionists.” (Interview with Nebosja Malic, RT)</p>
<p>It’s true that Washington supports Neo-Nazi extremists who burned down the Odessa Trade Unions House. If that wasn’t the case, then Obama would have spoken out forcefully against the action, which he has not. That implies that things are going according to plan. Malic is also correct when he says the fire was a “giant false flag operation” which refers to a covert military operation where agents disguise themselves as members of their adversary’s group to initiate a provocation that will then be blamed on the other side. In this case, pro-regime fascists (and probably agents from the Security Services) disguised themselves as Kiev regime opponents, in order to throw bricks and stones at the police and Right Sector goons. This was the flashpoint that started the melee that ended in a massacre.</p>
<p>Videos on Russia Today show the agents in red arm bands mingled with the pro-Russia activists, initiated a confrontation with the cops, and then quickly switched sides when the fighting broke out. This is classic false flag operation. The police were obviously in on the scam, as they immediately opened their ranks to let the imposters slip by when the street-scrum began. These same imposters were later filmed shooting handguns and automatic weapons in the direction of the building just minutes after they had switched sides. (Take a look at <a href="http://rt.com/bulletin-board/156776-rtnews-may05-1700msk/">this video</a> from 3:30 minutes to the 6 minute-point and decide for yourself whether this was a false flag operation or not.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: There was nothing spontaneous about the clash that led to the catastrophic fire that killed 40 people in the Trade Unions House. It was a carefully planned and executed operation designed to shock Moscow into sending troops to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine. If the CIA is working in Kiev –as it is–there is no doubt that they either knew or actively assisted the operation.</p>
<p>In related news: Moscow has announced it will “deploy additional forces in Crimea as part of beefing up the Black Sea fleet…before year’s end”. According to RT: “The fleet will receive new submarines and surface ships of new generation this year.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin is responding to the buildup of NATO forces in Eastern Europe and the Black Sea where additional aircraft, warships and ground troops have been deployed in case war breaks out. Also, according to RT:</p>
<p>“NATO’s three-week ‘Spring Storm’ drills, involving a record-breaking number of 6,000 troops, have begun in Estonia….(bringing) together a record number of allied troops.” (Also) around 150 personnel of the US airborne division arrived in a military transport aircraft to Amari airbase (while) the UK and France deployed eight fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland to strengthen NATO air defense over the Baltic regions.” (<a href="http://rt.com/news/156928-nato-military-drills-estonia/">NATO’s record 6,000-strong drills kick off in Estonia amid Ukraine tensions</a>, RT)</p>
<p>So while the death toll mounts, the slide to war continues to gain momentum. Odessa was supposed to be the tipping point, the “catalyzing event” that would draw Putin into the fighting. But it hasn’t worked out that way. Putin has stayed on the sidelines and refused to take the bait. That means there’ll be more provocations to come; more false flags, more bloodshed, more stage-managed terror disguised as civil unrest. Eventually, people will see who’s behind all the trouble. But how many will have died by then?</p>

<blockquote><p>“While Russia has been making efforts to de-escalate and resolve the crisis, the Kiev regime has chosen to launch airstrikes on peaceful residential areas, literally destroying the last hope for preserving the Geneva accords.” Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman</p>
<p>“The crisis in Ukraine is not the result of ‘Russian aggression,’ but of a criminal strategy by the US and its European allies to install a hostile regime on Russia’s borders in Ukraine and, ultimately, dismember Russia itself.” Johannes Stern, <a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/05/01/ukra-m01.html">NATO boosts military build-up against Russia as protests spread in east Ukraine</a>, WSWS</p></blockquote>
<p>Fighting broke out on Friday in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk when Kiev’s coup government deployed military helicopters to fire on the city while troops and armored vehicles stormed checkpoints. At the time this article went to press, two helicopters had been shot down killing at least two pilots while one was captured. In an impassioned statement on Russian TV, Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, appealed to allies in the EU to do whatever they could to persuade Ukrainian authorities to call off the operation and stop the violence.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are calling on the European capitals, the United States of America to give an assessment of the current events and are of course calling on those carrying out airstrikes on residential areas to…immediately end the punitive operation and any violence against its own people…”</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, there has been no response from Washington although it’s clear that the Obama administration had a hand in organizing the crackdown. Not only were the State Department and CIA directly involved in the putsch that removed democratically-elected president Viktor Yanukovych from office, but Washington has also been implicated in punitive operations directed against ethnic Russian protestors in east Ukraine. Both CIA Director John Brennan and Vice President Joe Biden visited Kiev just hours before two previous crackdowns were ordered by imposter-Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. As Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov blandly noted, It’s clear that Washington is “calling the shots”.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it looked like violence might be avoided when coup-President Oleksandr Turchynov said that he had lost control of the situation. In an exasperated message to the media, Turchnov said, “It is hard to accept but it’s the truth, but the majority of law enforcers in the east are incapable of performing their duties.”</p>
<p>Turchynov was referring to the fact that Ukrainian troops have refused to attack their own countrymen. The mutiny has reportedly spread from elite airborne units to local police who sympathize with the protestors. The only group that’s willing to carry out Washington’s proxy war is the Right Sector neo-Nazis who helped topple the Yanukovych government. Just last week, members of this openly fascist party, commemorated “the perpetrators of the massacre of Yanova Dolina,” where “600 Poles were murdered by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) in what is now Bazaltovoye. The massacre marked the beginning of ethnic cleansing in what is now western Ukraine, where tens of thousands of Poles were killed within a few months.” (World Socialist Web Site)</p>
<p>These are Obama’s new allies in America’s war against Russia. Now check this out from Reuters:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The International Monetary Fund warned that if Ukraine lost territory in the east it would have to redesign a $17 billion bailout of the country, probably requiring additional financing.” (<a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/05/02/uk-ukraine-crisis-idUKKBN0DI05620140502">Ukraine attacks rebel city, helicopter shot down</a>, Reuters)</p></blockquote>
<p>Tell me, dear reader, when was the last time you heard of the IMF threatening to withhold funds if a political leader didn’t wage war on his own people? Anyone with half a brain can see that the IMF is just acting on orders from the White House. This is Obama’s war. His fingerprints are all over the policy. Obama is determined to draw Russia into a bloody guerilla war that leaves Ukraine in the same condition as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and now Syria.</p>
<p>Here’s a clip from the New York Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Through stealth and misdirection, and in defiance of Western sanctions, Russia has managed to achieve its immediate goal of what Western and Ukrainian officials believe is rendering Ukraine so chaotic that it cannot guarantee order, mend its teetering economy or elect new leaders to replace Mr. Turchynov.” (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/opinion/not-getting-through-to-mr-putin.html?hp&amp;rref=opinion">Not Getting Through to Mr. Putin</a>, New York Times)</p></blockquote>
<p>Putin wants a “chaotic” failed state on Russia’s border? Have you ever read such nonsense in your life?</p>
<p>Putin didn’t topple the Ukrainian government. The US State Department did. (Victoria Nuland’s hacked phone calls prove it.) And Putin didn’t violate the Geneva agreement less than 24 hours after the deal was signed by launching a crackdown on civilian protestors in the east. That was US-puppet Yatsenyuk. Nor did Putin deploy the military to surround cities, cut off their water supplies and deploy helicopter gunships to fire missiles at civilian infrastructure and terrorize the local population. That was the work of Obama’s fascist junta in Kiev. Putin had nothing to do with any of the trouble in Ukraine. It’s all part of the US “pivot to Asia” strategy to encircle and (eventually) dismember Russia in order to seize vital resources and control the flow of energy to China. Washington wants to reduce Ukraine to Mad Max-type pandemonium to justify establishing NATO bases on Russia’s perimeter. It’s all part of the plan to control Central Asia and rule the world.</p>
<p>Putin has acted as peacemaker throughout the crisis, but Obama is determined to provoke the Russian president by attacking and killing ethnic Russians. Consider the statement by Russia’s Foreign Ministry following the helicopter incident on Friday morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>“As we have warned many times before, the use of the army against its own people is a crime and is leading Ukraine to catastrophe…By supporting the organizers of the Kiev coup in their strategy of violently putting down protests, the US and EU are taking on a huge responsibility, essentially closing the door to a peaceful solution to the crisis.” (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/02/putin-geneva-agreement-not-viable-ukraine-military-action">Putin says Geneva agreement no longer viable after Ukrainian military action</a>, Guardian)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s clear now that Obama merely used the Geneva agreement to buy time to move troops and military hardware to Poland and the Balkans. It’s also clear that Obama invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Washington so that it would appear that Europe is united behind the US in its proxy war on Russia. But what does Obama hope to achieve by stirring up this hornet’s nest? He knows that Putin cannot afford to back down on Crimea, so what’s the point? And, more importantly, what is Ukraine going to look like when Washington is finished using it as a staging-ground for its geopolitical landgrab? Here’s an insightful piece by Russian academic, Andrei Fursov, who thinks he knows what Obama wants and explains the impact the policy is going to have on Ukraine for years to come.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Americans need controlled chaos and civil war…Moreover, it is clear that this country (post-coup Ukraine) is intended to be absolutely anti-Russian, nationalist, Banderite and neo-Nazi. So the dual goal of establishing this anti-Russian state is to constantly apply pressure on the Russian Federation…</p>
<p>As Bismarck (said) ‘We must cultivate among the Ukrainians, a people whose consciousness is altered to such an extent, that they begin to hate everything Russian.’ …</p>
<p>Thus we are talking about a historical psy-op, an information-psychological sabotage, whose purpose is to establish Russophobic Slavs… They are the means to separate Ukraine from Russia and to oppose Russia as a kind … totalitarian empire. This was all devised under the Galician Project, on which the intelligence services of Austro-Germany and Kaiser German worked, followed by the intelligence service of the Third Reich, later – CIA and BND…</p>
<p>Banderastan, if that’s what Ukraine is fated to become, as designed by the puppet-masters across the ocean, is to be an oligarchic, terroristic, Russophobic state…An oligarchic Banderite…oligarchy is the ideal vehicle for external control. Clearly, this will suit both the oligarchs and the West.” (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-04-30/battleground-ukraine-comprehensive-summary-russian-perspective">Battleground Ukraine: A Comprehensive Summary</a>, Zero Hedge)</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there it is: Divide and rule. We saw the Bush administration pull it off with the Shia and Sunnis in Iraq, and now Obama wants to do the same with the Ukrainians and Russians. Same strategy, different continent.</p>
<p>This is Obama’s plan for the “New Ukraine” a fascist-ruled failed state that follows Washington’s directives and puts pressure on Russia thorough endless provocations, belligerence, and war. Ukraine will be Washington’s pit bull in the East, separating Moscow from crucial sources of revenue and thwarting efforts at greater EU-Russia economic integration. This is how Washington hopes to insert itself into Eurasia, to improve its prospects in the Great Game, and to establish global hegemony into the next century.</p>
<p><em>(Note: “Banderite” refers to Stepan Bandera, who was a Ukrainian nationalist leader who collaborated with the Nazis. Bandera headed the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) According to the World Socialist Web Site: “The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) carried out numerous massacres of the Polish population in western Ukraine…The UPA served as a military executive organ of the OUN. It was founded in the spring of 1943 and recruited primarily from Nazi collaborators who were previously active in the SS.”)</em></p>

</div>
<p>History has been made.  But few Americans are aware of it or angry about it.  I say: Wake up Americans.  A war has been waged against US democracy, from the inside.  Time to pick a side and fight back.</p>
<p>If you are not totally brain dead, distracted by pain or pleasure, or consumed by narcissistic obsessions, face the ugly, painful truth.</p>
<p>Republicans with political power in Congress and the states and, even more appallingly, on the Supreme Court have succeeded in turning their beloved republic into a-money-buys-power oligarchy.  One person, one vote was the enemy and it is being defeated.  One dollar, one vote is the new Republican political value.  American democracy is more delusional than ever.  To think otherwise is even more delusional.</p>
<p>I present three arguments supporting the conclusion that there has been a conversion of US democracy into something worse than a plutocracy.  Political power is more dependent on money than ever before.</p>
<p>First, Republicans controlling the House of Representatives and many controlling state governments, together with their rich supporters, have steadily and successfully eroded voting and election laws.  Their goal has been simple: Fight the demographic advantages of Democrats that give them more voters by making it more difficult for those citizens to actually vote.  This has been documented in a New York Times <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F03%2F30%2Fus%2Fnew-gop-bid-to-limit-voting-in-swing-states.html%3Fhp%26_r%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZxdR8JEaPv1h6T4-GvvfS5GVs5g">top story</a> and many other places.  Republicans see the obvious.  Namely that their older,-largely rural, white male shrinking proportion of the population is insufficient to win many elections and, even more significant, that many of their policy positions will never prevail with many demographic groups.</p>
<p>As Damon Linker <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftheweek.com%2Farticle%2Findex%2F259065%2Fthe-gops-new-voting-laws-are-nothing-less-than-a-war-on-democracy&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4Q4OfbbVVTxDN8R6oMJn8sGJT6A">observed</a> about this statistical reality, this is a “tacit acknowledgement by the Republican Party that it&#8217;s in dire demographic straits — and that one of the key pillars of its ideology over the last half-century is crumbling right before our eyes.”  Their solution, besides vicious gerrymandering of House districts, is to make it ever more difficult for groups likely to favor Democrats to vote in all elections.  This direct assault on electoral democracy depends considerably on money coming from the wealthiest people to finance the actions to change election laws.</p>
<p>Second, the Supreme Court is now controlled by a Republican majority that has been successfully producing decisions to remove limits to money dumped into the political system by the richest Americans.  For example, recently <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salon.com%2F2014%2F04%2F02%2Fsupreme_courts_abomination_how_mccutcheon_decision_will_destroy_american_politics%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPd6xs_-_LjSB-L4qKVHKQJziBdw">the <em>McCutcheon</em> decision</a>  continued the Roberts Court program of gutting campaign-finance laws.  Hard to believe, but this decision came to the aid of just 1,219 people in the US—that&#8217;s four in every 1,000,000 of our population, who ran up against a contribution limit.  But this is consistent with the insanity that money is the same as free speech, which the Supreme Court has made the law of the land.</p>
<p>As Robert Reich correctly <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2Fopinion%2Freich%2Farticle%2FHuge-wealth-gap-caused-backlash-before-and-may-5396174.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFo8Jq3s-BdYRBrx5Hygez9ympJxg">noted</a>: “The court said such spending doesn&#8217;t corrupt democracy.  That&#8217;s utter baloney, as anyone who has the faintest familiarity with contemporary American politics well knows.”  Political money is used to greatly impact lawmaking and elections.  Political power obtained through political spending is, of course, essential for the richest Americans to maintain and perhaps intensify the economic inequality that now distinguishes American society.  It is how an oligarchy is obtained and sustained.</p>
<p>I hope that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fopinion%2Fbrent-budowsky%2F203150-brent-budowsky-history-to-impeach-roberts&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGC1odEsO5hPG-L9XyCNO6pc06LVg">Brent Budowsky</a> is correct.  Namely that “Roberts and his four conservative Republican brethren will ultimately be impeached by historians who will condemn, and future courts that will reverse, politically illegitimate and constitutionally deformed rulings that would turn America into a constitutional oligarchy.”  But change “would turn” into “have turned.”</p>
<p>Third, as still more proof of the profound historic change in the US, a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mgilens/Gilens%20homepage%20materials/Gilens%20and%20Page/Gilens%20and%20Page%202014-Testing%20Theories%203-7-14.pdf">recent study</a> from Princeton University that analyzed considerable data concluded that the US has become an oligarchy. Here is what this important study said: “In the United States, our findings indicate, the majority does not rule &#8212; at least not in the causal sense of actually determining policy outcomes. When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the U.S. political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, they generally do not get it.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, “Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance, such as regular elections, freedom of speech and association, and a widespread (if still contested) franchise. But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful business organizations and a small number of affluent Americans, then America’s claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened.”  In other words, it is time for Americans to stop believing delusional truths and recognize that US democracy has become a myth, especially if there are ever to be serious actions by the majority to fix and restore democracy.</p>
<p>Americans, especially younger ones, need to understand the historical path from democracy to plutocracy to oligarchy.  Most Americans are suffering because of economic inequality and they need to understand that the economic system is under the control of the perverted political system.  Anyone who is not in the Upper Class or proverbial top one percent who votes for Republicans is living in some fantasy world.  Such voters have been brainwashed and manipulated by, for example, FOX News and blowhards like Limbaugh.</p>
<p>Republicans want even more power.  And if they get it, what would you expect from those working so hard to make US democracy a joke and replace millions of voters with one percent oligarchs?  What Republicans have been doing is nothing less than domestic political terrorism.  If Republicans and Tea Party loyalists were true patriots, they would rebel against the oligarchy created by Republicans.</p>
<p>Finally, make no mistake and think this condemnation of Republicans equates to advocacy for Democrats.  The ultimate solution if a better, more democratic US system is to be obtained is not to rely on putting Democrats in control who also have some billionaires on their side.  No, what is required is a number of constitutional amendments obtained through an <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffoavc.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqOc3subULubaCKthQLaXMiWnQnQ">Article V convention</a>that are necessary to structurally reform the political system, especially getting rid of the power of political money.  In recent months there has been a historic increase in support from important people for constitutional amendments and greater public support is desperately needed to finally use the constitutional option given by the Founders to the nation.</p>

			<p><strong>Part 1:  Changing the DNA structure of the Mother Nature&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/belgianblue3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>In the 20st century, the human mob re-arranged rivers, deserts, rainforests and the oceans to suit its voracious appetite for dominance over the Natural World.  Stemming from that 100-year epic onslaught, we humans created communities around the globe featuring 10 million, 20 million to 36 million people piled up in mega-cities around the world.</p>
<p>We contaminated rivers with our poisons, the air with our fossil fuel exhaust and clear cut rainforests by the millions of acres.  Our onslaught of the Natural World continues with 80 to 100 species of our fellow travelers losing their existence 24/7 to our encroachment upon their habitat. (Source: Norman Myers, Oxford University)</p>
<p>One of our most prolific acts continues on the bees and other pollinators around the world.  In the past 50 years, we poisoned every crop with hundreds of chemical herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers, which, in turn, caused trillions of bees to suffer “Colony Collapse” throughout the world.  Without the bees, which I wrote about earlier this year, our species cannot feed itself.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, in the 21st century, in order to feed our 7.2 billion in numbers, we began tinkering with the structural DNA of plants and animals. </p>
<p>Today, our scientists change the DNA patterns of fish and plants in order to make them bigger, grow faster and yield more harvest: genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p>But we forgot to ask Mother Nature if our meddling in her business would cause any harm.  Amazingly, we allow governments, scientists on the payroll of companies like ADM and Monsanto, to tell us that such activities work to make our lives better with no harm to the natural world.</p>
<p>With my research on GMOs connecting their horrific harm to the Natural World and ultimately to we humans, this series will show you the “GMO Frankenstein” being foisted upon us by ugly businessmen in high places to could care less about you, your family or the rest of the species sharing this planet with us.</p>
<p>My intention in writing this series: to educate you to the incredible damage GMO foods cause you along with your family and more important: the horrific destruction to the Natural World.</p>
<p>If you look at human cancers spreading like wildfire across America and the world and every physical ailment we face in America, along the accelerating damage to bees, other pollinators and to the fish in our oceans—you will become appalled at this onslaught and its final consequences.</p>
<p>Investigative reporter Jeremy Siefert said, “When people first hear about just the basic facts concerning Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs or Genetically Engineered Foods) – the DNA of seeds altered with genes from other organisms like bacteria so food crops can withstand herbicides that will kill all other plants, patented by giant chemical companies and found in 80% of processed foods – the standard response is “Oh, my God.” For some, it’s just an exclamation, but for others, it’s the beginnings of a prayer. There’s a mixture of horror and disbelief, as if finding out we’re living inside a very strange sci-fi novel. Beyond that, it’s the sting of humiliation from being ignorant about something so big, mixed with the anger that comes from feeling like you’ve been duped.</p>
<p>“Even without understanding what a GMO is or why it matters, most of us believe as citizens of a supposedly free and democratic society that we have the right to know if GMOs are in the food we eat. The fact we don’t know, and that our right to know has been taken away by corporate greed and government collusion, should upset and mobilize people. When all the food and seed and water and air is owned and patented by giant multinational corporations, will we even protest? Do we have the wakefulness and willpower to take that first step and stand up for this basic right?” (Source: <a href="http://www.fairworldproject.org">www.fairworldproject.org</a>)</p>
<p>What I discovered in my research: ADM and Monsanto do not want you to know, along with high government officials, the deleterious effects on the Natural World that GMO food production causes in the long run.  These mega-giant corporations “own” regulatory agencies, government officials (bribes or dandy trips to anywhere in the world), and other complicit chemical companies around the world.</p>
<p>Be warned, you will not like the kind of treachery being foisted upon you by your U.S. Congress and officials who should present a moral and ethical stance against GMOs, but fail us because of one item: money.</p>
<p>Thus, as we move through this series, you may choose to save yourself and your family by buying “Certified Organic Foods” along with “Certified Non-Genetically Modified Organism” foods that give you the nutrients of Mother Nature without the “Frankenization” of your food supply and of the planet’s natural systems.  Additionally, Monsanto and other HUGE corporations work every angle to stop any “GMO” labeling of their poisonous foods.  Why do you think the do that?</p>
<p>If this information educates you enough, you may take action provided in the organizations and leaders trying to rid the world of GMOs.  Help them and ultimately, you will help your family.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if these “monsters” of Monsanto and ADM get their way, they will cripple this world, all living creatures and the structural systems that allow all life on Earth to remain in balance and allow us all to thrive.</p>

<p>Is there anyone out there who still believes that Barack Obama, when he’s speaking about American foreign policy, is capable of being anything like an honest man? In a March 26 talk in Belgium to “European youth”, the president fed his audience one falsehood, half-truth, blatant omission, or hypocrisy after another. If George W. Bush had made some of these statements, Obama supporters would not hesitate to shake their head, roll their eyes, or smirk. Here’s a sample:</p>
<p>– <em>“In defending its actions, Russian leaders have further claimed Kosovo as a precedent – an example they say of the West interfering in the affairs of a smaller country, just as they’re doing now. But NATO only intervened after the people of Kosovo were systematically brutalized and killed for years.”</em></p>
<p>Most people who follow such things are convinced that the 1999 US/NATO bombing of the Serbian province of Kosovo took place only after the Serbian-forced deportation of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo was well underway; which is to say that the bombing was launched to <em>stop</em> this “ethnic cleansing”. In actuality, the systematic deportations of large numbers of people did not begin until a few days <em>after</em> the bombing began, and was clearly a reaction to it, born of Serbia’s extreme anger and powerlessness over the bombing. This is easily verified by looking at a daily newspaper for the few days before the bombing began the night of March 23/24, 1999, and the few days following. Or simply look at the <em>New York Times</em> of March 26, page 1, which reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>… with the NATO bombing already begun, a deepening sense of fear took hold in Pristina [the main city of Kosovo] that the Serbs would <em><strong>now</strong></em> vent their rage against ethnic Albanian civilians in retaliation. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>On March 27, we find the first reference to a “forced march” or anything of that nature.</p>
<p>But the propaganda version is already set in marble.</p>
<p>– <em>“And Kosovo only left Serbia after a referendum was organized, not outside the boundaries of international law, but in careful cooperation with the United Nations and with Kosovo’s neighbors. None of that even came close to happening in Crimea.”</em></p>
<p>None of that even came close to happening in Kosovo either. The story is false. The referendum the president speaks of never happened. Did the mainstream media pick up on this or on the previous example? If any reader comes across such I’d appreciate being informed.</p>
<p>Crimea, by the way, did have a referendum. A real one.</p>
<p>– <em>“Workers and engineers gave life to the Marshall Plan … As the Iron Curtain fell here in Europe, the iron fist of apartheid was unclenched, and Nelson Mandela emerged upright, proud, from prison to lead a multiracial democracy. Latin American nations rejected dictatorship and built new democracies … “</em></p>
<p>The president might have mentioned that the main beneficiary of the Marshall Plan was US corporations  , that the United States played an indispensable role in Mandela being caught and imprisoned, and that virtually all the Latin American dictatorships owed their very existence to Washington. Instead, the European youth were fed the same party line that their parents were fed, as were all Americans.</p>
<p>– <em>“Yes, we believe in democracy – with elections that are free and fair.”</em></p>
<p>In this talk, the main purpose of which was to lambaste the Russians for their actions concerning Ukraine, there was no mention that the government overthrown in that country with the clear support of the United States had been democratically elected.</p>
<p>– <em>“Moreover, Russia has pointed to America’s decision to go into Iraq as an example of Western hypocrisy. … But even in Iraq, America sought to work within the international system. We did not claim or annex Iraq’s territory. We did not grab its resources for our own gain. Instead, we ended our war and left Iraq to its people and a fully sovereign Iraqi state that could make decisions about its own future.”</em></p>
<p>The US did not get UN Security Council approval for its invasion, the only approval that could legitimize the action. It occupied Iraq from one end of the country to the other for 8 years, forcing the government to privatize the oil industry and accept multinational – largely U.S.-based, oil companies’ – ownership. This endeavor was less than successful because of the violence unleashed by the invasion. The US military finally was forced to leave because the Iraqi government refused to give immunity to American soldiers for their many crimes.</p>
<p>Here is a brief summary of what Barack Obama is attempting to present as America’s moral superiority to the Russians:</p>
<p>The modern, educated, advanced nation of Iraq was reduced to a quasi failed state … the Americans, beginning in 1991, bombed for 12 years, with one dubious excuse or another; then invaded, then occupied, overthrew the government, tortured without inhibition, killed wantonly … the people of that unhappy land lost everything – their homes, their schools, their electricity, their clean water, their environment, their neighborhoods, their mosques, their archaeology, their jobs, their careers, their professionals, their state-run enterprises, their physical health, their mental health, their health care, their welfare state, their women’s rights, their religious tolerance, their safety, their security, their children, their parents, their past, their present, their future, their lives … More than half the population either dead, wounded, traumatized, in prison, internally displaced, or in foreign exile … The air, soil, water, blood, and genes drenched with depleted uranium … the most awful birth defects … unexploded cluster bombs lying in wait for children to pick them up … a river of blood running alongside the Euphrates and Tigris … through a country that may never be put back together again. … “It is a common refrain among war-weary Iraqis that things were better before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003,” reported the <em>Washington Post</em>. (May 5, 2007)</p>
<p>How can all these mistakes, such arrogance, hypocrisy and absurdity find their way into a single international speech by the president of the United States? Is the White House budget not sufficient to hire a decent fact checker? Someone with an intellect and a social conscience? Or does the desire to score propaganda points trump everything else? Is this another symptom of the Banana-Republicization of America?</p>
<h3>Long live the Cold War</h3>
<p>In 1933 US President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the Soviet Union after some 15 years of severed relations following the Bolshevik Revolution. On a day in December of that year, a train was passing through Poland carrying the first American diplomats dispatched to Moscow. Amongst their number was a 29 year-old Foreign Service Officer, later to become famous as a diplomat and scholar, George Kennan. Though he was already deemed a government expert on Russia, the train provided Kennan’s first actual exposure to the Soviet Union. As he listened to his group’s escort, Russian Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, reminisce about growing up in a village the train was passing close by, and his dreams of becoming a librarian, the Princeton-educated Kennan was astonished: “We suddenly realized, or at least I did, that these people we were dealing with were human beings like ourselves, that they had been born somewhere, that they had their childhood ambitions as we had. It seemed for a brief moment we could break through and embrace these people.”</p>
<p>It hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>One would think that the absence in Russia of communism, of socialism, of the basic threat or challenge to the capitalist system, would be sufficient to write <em>finis</em> to the 70-year Cold War mentality. But the United States is virtually as hostile to 21st-century Russia as it was to 20th-century Soviet Union, surrounding Moscow with military bases, missile sites, and NATO members. Why should that be? Ideology is no longer a factor. But power remains one, specifically America’s perpetual lust for world hegemony. Russia is the only nation that (a) is a military powerhouse, and (b) doesn’t believe that the United States has a god-given-American-exceptionalism right to rule the world, and says so. By these criteria, China might qualify as a poor second. But there are no others.</p>
<p>Washington pretends that it doesn’t understand why Moscow should be upset by Western military encroachment, but it has no such problem when roles are reversed. Secretary of State John Kerry recently stated that Russian troops poised near eastern Ukraine are “creating a climate of fear and intimidation in Ukraine” and raising questions about Russia’s next moves and its commitment to diplomacy.</p>
<p>NATO – ever in need of finding a <em>raison d’être</em> – has now issued a declaration of [cold] war, which reads in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>“NATO foreign ministers on Tuesday [April 1, 2014] reaffirmed their commitment to enhance the Alliance’s collective defence, agreed to further support Ukraine and to suspend NATO’s practical cooperation with Russia. ‘NATO’s greatest responsibility is to protect and defend our territory and our people. And make no mistake, this is what we will do,’ NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. … Ministers directed Allied military authorities to develop additional measures to strengthen collective defence and deterrence against any threat of aggression against the Alliance, Mr. Fogh Rasmussen said. ‘We will make sure we have updated military plans, enhanced exercises and appropriate deployments,’ he said. NATO has already reinforced its presence on the eastern border of the Alliance, including surveillance patrols over Poland and Romania and increased numbers of fighter aircraft allocated to the NATO air policing mission in the Baltic States. … NATO Foreign Ministers also agreed to suspend all of NATO’s practical cooperation with Russia.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Does anyone recall what NATO said in 2003 when the United States bombed and invaded Iraq with “shock and awe”, compared to the Russians now not firing a single known shot at anyone? And neither Russia nor Ukraine is even a member of NATO. Does NATO have a word to say about the right-wing coup in Ukraine, openly supported by the United States, overthrowing the elected government? Did the hypocrisy get any worse during the Cold War? Imagine that NATO had not been created in 1949. Imagine that it has never existed. What reason could one give today for its creation? Other than to provide a multi-national cover for Washington’s interventions.</p>
<p>One of the main differences between now and the Cold War period is that Americans at home are (not yet) persecuted or prosecuted for supporting Russia or things Russian.</p>
<p>But don’t worry, folks, there won’t be a big US-Russian war. For the same reason there wasn’t one during the Cold War. The United States doesn’t pick on any country which can defend itself.</p>
<h3>Cuba … Again … Still … Forever</h3>
<p>Is there actually a limit? Will the United States ever stop trying to overthrow the Cuban government? Entire books have been written documenting the unrelenting ways Washington has tried to get rid of tiny Cuba’s horrid socialism – from military invasion to repeated assassination attempts to an embargo that President Clinton’s National Security Advisor called “the most pervasive sanctions ever imposed on a nation in the history of mankind”.  But nothing has ever come even close to succeeding. The horrid socialism keeps on inspiring people all over the world. It’s the darnedest thing. Can providing people free or remarkably affordable health care, education, housing, food and culture be all that important?</p>
<p>And now it’s “Cuban Twitter” – an elaborately complex system set up by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to disguise its American origins and financing, aiming to bring about a “Cuban Spring” uprising. USAID sought to first “build a Cuban audience, mostly young people; then the plan was to push them toward dissent”, hoping the messaging network “would reach critical mass so that dissidents could organize ‘smart mobs’ – mass gatherings called at a moment’s notice – that might trigger political demonstrations or ‘renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society’.”  It’s too bad it’s now been exposed, because we all know how wonderful the Egyptian, Syrian, Libyan, and other “Arab Springs” have turned out.</p>
<p>Here’s USAID speaking after their scheme was revealed on April 3: “Cubans were able to talk among themselves, and we are proud of that.”  We are thus asked to believe that normally the poor downtrodden Cubans have no good or safe way to communicate with each other. Is the US National Security Agency working for the Cuban government now?</p>
<p>The <em>Associated Press</em>, which broke the story, asks us further to believe that the “truth” about most things important in the world is being kept from the Cuban people by the Castro regime, and that the “Cuban Twitter” would have opened people’s eyes. But what information might a Cuban citizen discover online that the government would not want him to know about? I can’t imagine. Cubans are in constant touch with relatives in the US, by mail and in person. They get US television programs from Miami and other southern cities; both CNN and Telesur (Venezuela, covering Latin America) are seen regularly on Cuban television”; international conferences on all manner of political, economic and social issues are held regularly in Cuba. I’ve spoken at more than one myself. What – it must be asked – does USAID, as well as the American media, think are the great dark secrets being kept from the Cuban people by the nasty commie government?</p>
<p>Those who push this line sometimes point to the serious difficulty of using the Internet in Cuba. The problem is that it’s extremely slow, making certain desired usages often impractical. From an American friend living in Havana: “It’s not a question of getting or not getting internet. I get internet here. The problem is downloading something or connecting to a link takes too long on the very slow connection that exists here, so usually I/we get ‘timed out’.” But the USAID’s “Cuban Twitter”, after all, could not have functioned at all without the Internet.</p>
<p>Places like universities, upscale hotels, and Internet cafés get better connections, at least some of the time; however, it’s rather expensive to use at the hotels and cafés.</p>
<p>In any event, this isn’t a government plot to hide dangerous information. It’s a matter of technical availability and prohibitive cost, both things at least partly in the hands of the United States and American corporations. Microsoft, for example, at one point, if not at present, barred Cuba from using its Messenger instant messaging service.</p>
<p>Cuba and Venezuela have jointly built a fiber optic underwater cable connection that they hope will make them less reliant on the gringos; the outcome of this has not yet been reported in much detail.</p>
<p>The grandly named Agency for International Development does not have an honorable history; this can perhaps be captured by a couple of examples: In 1981, the agency’s director, John Gilligan, stated: “At one time, many AID field offices were infiltrated from top to bottom with CIA people. The idea was to plant operatives in every kind of activity we had overseas, government, volunteer, religious, every kind.”</p>
<p>On June 21, 2012, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) issued a resolution calling for the immediate expulsion of USAID from their nine member countries, “due to the fact that we consider their presence and actions to constitute an interference which threatens the sovereignty and stability of our nations.”</p>
<p>USAID, the CIA, the National Endowment for Democracy (and the latter’s subsidiaries), together or singly, continue to be present at regime changes, or attempts at same, favorable to Washington, from “color revolutions” to “spring” uprisings, producing a large measure of chaos and suffering for our tired old world.</p>

<p>The freedom of the press and the freedom of religion are two of the most important elements of a free society. These were so important to America’s Founding Fathers that they were protected in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A free and independent press serves as watchdogs for liberty, while a free and independent church serves as watchmen for liberty. Sadly, both watchdog and watchman are, for the most part, missing in today’s America.</p>
<p>Just about everyone knows that the vast majority of the national press corps has a strong liberal bias. That’s a given. But, it’s actually worse than that. Instead of being watchdogs on the government, the mainstream media has become little more than lap dogs for the government. Instead of reporting the truth, most of the media is actually more concerned with covering up the truth. With precious few exceptions, investigative reporting is dead in the national news media.</p>
<p>Oh, sure. Republican administrations are depicted more negatively by the mainstream media than are Democrat administrations. No doubt about that. Can anyone recall the media hoopla over Vice President Dan Quayle’s misspelling of the word “potato”? The liberal media talked about that almost nonstop for months. But did you hear much of anything when President Barack Obama recently misspelled the word “respect”? I mean from media sources outside of FOX News? Nope. Nary a word.</p>
<p>But when it comes to investigating the truth behind what government spokesmen tell us, it doesn’t matter to a tinker’s dam whether it is a Republican or Democrat administration: about the only thing national newscasters know to do is to report whatever the official story of the government is. Once in a blue moon, a mainstream newspaper, such as the New York Times, will dare to print a report that questions an official government story, but not very often. And when such a report is printed, it digs only so deep. For the last several years, about the only major newspaper that has had the guts to actually do some real investigative reporting is the London Guardian. Even the Washington Times prints mostly milquetoast exposés.</p>
<p>CBS reporter, Sharly Attkisson, recently left the network due to its liberal bias and aversion to investigative reporting. Politico said this about Attkisson’s leaving: “Attkisson, who has been with CBS News for two decades, had grown frustrated with what she saw as the network’s liberal bias, an outsize influence by the network’s corporate partners and a lack of dedication to investigative reporting, several sources said. She increasingly felt that her work was no longer supported and that it was a struggle to get her reporting on air.”</p>
<p>See the Politico report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fblogs%2Fmedia%2F2014%2F03%2Fsharyl-attkisson-to-leave-cbs-news-184836.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG69XPKd5HQAEFkTxHjTfsYx1S_7Q" target="_blank">Sharyl Attkisson Resigns From CBS News</a></p>
<p>In an interview with the CBS affiliate in Philadelphia, Chris Stigall reported, “Responding to comments regarding a Phoenix television reporter yesterday who initially claimed that the White House pre-screens questions from reporters, Attkisson said, ‘I wouldn’t [be] surprised if sometimes there is that level of cooperation with some questions. If I need something answered from the White House and they won’t tell me, I’ll call our White House Correspondent. They’re friendlier with the White House Correspondents in general. So the White House Correspondent may ask Jay Carney or one of his folks about an issue and they will be told “ask that at the briefing and we’ll answer it.” They want to answer it in front of everybody. They do know it’s coming and they’ll call on you. There’s that kind of coordination sometimes. I wouldn’t be shocked if there’s sometimes more coordination. I don’t think it’s everybody on every briefing, every day. I’m pretty sure it’s not. But I think people would be surprised at the level of cooperation reporters have in general with politicians.’”</p>
<p>See Stigall’s report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fphiladelphia.cbslocal.com%2F2014%2F03%2F21%2Fsharyl-attkisson-there-is-coordination-between-reporters-and-politicians%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZjckKYKULZiJS9dpCDh8KSMwr9g" target="_blank">Sharyl Attkisson: There Is Coordination Between Reporters And Politicians</a></p>
<p>Attkisson was putting it very mildly. There is more than just coordination going on between the federal government and the national news media; it’s more like coziness and calculated manipulation.</p>
<p>Since when has the major media dared to investigate and report the truth regarding any of the major events that have transpired in this country? The last time there was even a semblance of genuine investigative reporting seen in the national press corps was during the Watergate scandal when Richard Nixon was President&#8211;and that was politically-motivated from start to finish.</p>
<p>The mainstream media didn’t bother to seriously investigate Ruby Ridge or Waco or the Oklahoma City bombing or TWA Flight 800 or the Sandy Hook shootings or (and especially) the attacks which occurred on 9/11/01. These events took place with both Republicans and Democrats at the helm: it didn’t matter. Government spokesmen gave the media the official story, and the media repeatedly regurgitated the official story until anyone who dared to question the official story was turned into a conspiracy nut. That’s not reporting the news, folks. That is manipulating the news to disseminate propaganda. Joseph Goebbels had nothing on the major media in America today.</p>
<p>Again, the modern American media are not watchdogs over government; they are lap dogs for government. Reporters who try to truly dig and investigate are seldom rewarded&#8211;just the opposite. Their stories are buried&#8211;if published at all. They are disinvited from interviewing notable dignitaries. They are passed over for promotions&#8211;or even dismissed. It doesn’t take people in the news business long to get the message that if they want to go anywhere, they must toe the line and become good little puppets. The First Amendment freedom of the press has been negated by the press itself.</p>
<p>Likewise, the First Amendment freedom of religion has also been negated. A free and independent clergy is essential to the maintenance of liberty. But, for the most part, America has not had a free and independent clergy in decades.</p>
<p>The IRS 501c3 designation for churches, along with State incorporation, has turned America’s watchmen into little more than glorified CEOs. The average pulpit is just as politically correct as the national news media. Plus, the average church is as much about the bottom line as news shows.</p>
<p>Did you know that there used to be a time when the major television networks expected that their news shows would not operate in the black financially? It’s true. Back then, it was more important that news shows reported and investigated the news than turn a profit. Therefore, corporate donations and government chagrin had little impact upon newscasters and reporters. Those days are long gone.</p>
<p>By the same token, did you know that there used to be a time in this country when most of our pastors and ministers (regardless of denomination) were more concerned about being Biblically correct than being politically correct? For example, so prominent was the role that Presbyterian pastors played in the American Revolution that as news of the rebellion spread throughout England, Horace Walpole told his fellow members of the British Parliament, “There is no use crying about it. Cousin America has run off with a Presbyterian parson, and that is the end of it.” Of course, Presbyterians were not the only clergymen in Colonial America to champion the cause of liberty and independence from behind their pulpits.</p>
<p>In truth, if it wasn’t for clergymen such as John Leland (along with political statesmen such as Patrick Henry, of course), it is doubtful that there would even be a First Amendment&#8211;or the rest of the Bill of Rights, for that matter.</p>
<p>But, back then, pastors were not motivated by the desire to build big buildings or impress political potentates or climb ecclesiastical elevators. They were motivated by courage and commitment. And you could tell it every time you went to church. They didn’t mince words; and their sermons seldom concluded in less than an hour. They were watchmen.</p>
<p>Sadly, in the same manner in which the national news media have abandoned their responsibility as America’s watchdogs, so, too, the vast majority of pastors have abandoned their responsibility as America’s watchmen. The First Amendment protection of the freedom of the press and religion is not enough to protect the freedom of the press and religion from themselves.</p>
<p>To be sure, many of our pastors and ministers today are sincere, compassionate, and honorable men. But they have never been taught the Biblical principles of liberty; they have never been taught how to apply the liberty principles of Scripture to our everyday lives&#8211;including our political lives; they have never been taught the true meaning of Biblical submission in general and Romans 13 in particular. However, more and more of these men are coming awake to these things. Of course, others stubbornly refuse to even consider the truth of these matters.</p>
<p>But, listen up, folks! Truth will always find a way to reveal itself: the dear Lord will make sure of that. As the mainstream media became toadies of Big Government, along came independent radio talk shows, newspapers, and the Internet. And in all likelihood, more people are getting their news and information from online sources today than from network or cable news shows. As a result, more and more people are awakening to the truth every day.</p>
<p>And, by the same token, as many establishment churches and pastors have become toadies of the IRS and political correctness, new, independent, unorganized, non-501c3 churches and fellowships are sprouting up all over America. Some of these groups are led by ministers whom God has led out of the establishment church. Others are led by laymen who have likewise left the establishment church. I hear from these people every day. And, by the grace of God, I hope to be more personally involved in helping Christian people around the country form liberty-oriented churches. More on that soon.</p>
<p>The First Amendment was designed to protect America’s watchdogs and watchmen. And it is a truism that there can never be a revival of liberty in this land without a resurrection of our watchdogs and watchmen. The good news is that resurrection is already taking place.</p>
