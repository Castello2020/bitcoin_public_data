<p>Humanity’s horizons glowed from the brilliance of Nikola Tesla. But to our horrible misfortune, the glow was much too bright for the Power Status Quo (PSQ). Money means power, and Tesla cost tycoons a lot of money by slaying with alternating current (AC) the dead-end direct current (DC) power distribution system of Thomas Edison (financed by J.P Morgan).</p>
<p>More than forty of Tesla’s patents from 1888 cover the entire system of “polyphase” AC that, virtually unchanged, powers civilization to this day—a monumental lifetime achievement for any man.</p>
<p>But polyphase AC didn’t lead directly to the PSQ’s campaign of erasing Tesla from history. It was “<strong>Tesla’s Coil</strong>,” key to unlocking “Aether” and harnessing “Radiant Electricity.” The ultimate forbidden technology, Aether and Radiant Electricity was a primary focus of Tesla’s last forty years on Earth.</p>
<p>By tapping the Aether, by touching “ . . . the wheelwork of nature,” Tesla illuminated visions of humanity freed from domination by the likes of Rothschild, Morgan, Rockefeller . . . the entire global tyranny machine powered largely by fossil energy, private central banking, war.</p>
<p>One man found an antidote for pathocracy, humanity’s premier poison. [1] His name was Nikola Tesla; that remains one of the few things about the man that has not been altered by the PSQ. The name survives, but little else about Tesla has not been violated. His crime or “sin” was competition tycoons couldn’t control.</p>
<p>Tesla always knew he would triumph. In his own words, regarding tycoons such as J.P. Morgan: “I am unwilling to accord to some small-minded and jealous individuals the satisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing more than microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. The world was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time, but the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success.”</p>
<p>Tesla’s “ . . . triumphal success” has the power to unwind tyranny. All we need is for enough humans to awaken from the PSQ’s spell. Tesla obviously thought awakening was possible even while insisting, “No free energy device will ever be allowed to reach the market.” Tesla knew that mass awakening was the wildcard. If we let him down, we let humanity down.</p>
<p>Tycoons throw enormous wealth at protecting people from reality by keeping them asleep. But waking up is free, the only ticket to freedom of development of the human potential.</p>
<p>Freedom . . . a gorgeous concept increasingly hollowed-out by the PSQ. Try to imagine what humanity might achieve without being kicked in the face by the psychopathic elite.</p>
<p>George Orwell said in his novel, <em>1984</em><em>,</em> “If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.”</p>
<p>If we have any chance at proving Orwell wrong, Tesla might be our best hope. So he gets the boot. But they haven’t stamped out Tesla’s <em>spirit</em><em>.</em> His ultimate technology is still alive not only in Black-Ops, but in laboratories of valiant researchers cheating death-by-truth.</p>
<p>The PSQ’s perpetual fouling of Tesla accents his elevation of what it means to be human. That most salient testament to Tesla’s brilliance, his suppression by the PSQ—it’s all around us, hidden in plain sight.</p>
<p>Style of the PSQ exhibits fear of people thinking for themselves. As long as pockets of human intelligence resist brainwashing, and independent thoughts fly around uncontrolled, that means the PSQ’s choke hold on power is not “safe.” Similar alarm flourished in America’s top Rothschild agent, J.P. Morgan. [2] He knew monopolistic fortunes were not safe with Tesla a funded free spirit. Morgan and other tycoons stung by the “War of the Currents” [3] went into a defensive blitz. And when Tesla denied Morgan control of Radiant Electricity, Morgan had Tesla’s laboratories burned down. Works of genius were destroyed, but not the man. Morgan also instructed the four publishers of school textbooks to never mention Nikola Tesla; ditto for the Smithsonian—Nikola Tesla was an unperson. Morgan stamped like a professional on truth about Tesla. And the money boot keeps stamping with help from public ignorance, fear of the unknown, trust in “authority.” . . .</p>
<p>Creativity . . . humans working outside “the box”—writers, inventors, scientists and researchers and free spirits soaring above dogma embody what the PSQ fears in humanity. Nikola Tesla is a stellar example of what the PSQ fears most.</p>
<p>Tesla revered nature, not money. That got Tesla the electrical wizard off to a bad start with the PSQ—a moral eminence compounded by Tesla’s public declaration: “Science is but a perversion of itself unless it has as its ultimate goal the betterment of humanity.”</p>
<p>Those were fighting words to the tycoons—especially the part about, “ . . . betterment of humanity.” Tycoons seek “arrested human development,” conspire to fit humanity with cement overshoes. Tesla’s treasures remain difficult to fathom with the PSQ so good at not only mangling and suppressing them, but misrepresenting many as works of Edison, Marconi and others.</p>
<p>On his deathbed, Edison said his biggest mistake had been in trying to develop direct current, rather than the superior alternating current system that Tesla had put within his grasp.</p>
<p>Tesla’s reply about Marconi’s work in radio: “Marconi is a good fellow. Let him continue. He is using 17 of my patents.”</p>
<p>If Tesla doesn’t terrify the PSQ, why their obsession with polluting his accomplishments? Why did they ban Tesla in textbooks and at the Smithsonian, choke off his funding and conjure him into a bogeyman?</p>
<p>Standard indoctrination coddles third graders along in this video of an “Awesome! ‘Tesla Coil’” (don’t miss Alex Jones growling in the wings). [4]</p>
<p>Here’s an encouraging story of spunky third graders with a great teacher, and their letter-writing campaign focused on getting Tesla acknowledged in the Smithsonian. [5]</p>
<p>Among Tesla’s most noble contributions to humanity and the cause of freedom . . . his intimate disclosure of PSQ’s will to protect their power at the complete disregard of humanity. Tesla revealed what it means to be psychopathic, and elite, showing humanity what inhumanity we are up against. Destruction of competition is a martial situation where, as the PSQ likes to frame it: “No options are off the table.”</p>
<p>The Internet has made progress against common public sentiment regarding Tesla being derivatives of: “I heard Tesla was kind of a crackpot.” Big money manipulates this idea from off in the wings, but when it comes to truth about Tesla, austerity takes center stage.</p>
<p>A nurtured “ . . . then how come?” variety of popular ignorance clings to the idea: “If Tesla was so great, then how come we’re not utilizing his so-called ultimate technology?” The PSQ religiously stamping out competition is “how come.” And once again, when it comes to protecting their monopolies, “ . . . nothing is off the table.”</p>
<p>Accurate information about Tesla still haunts the Internet. People can even learn about Eric Dollard. [6] But the PSQ’s “Internet problem” seems merely a speed bump, considering the PSQ’s record of successfully controlling whatever they want to control, if given enough time. Where would the PSQ be without it’s enablers, us?</p>
<p>A great quote from Eric Dollard: “Tesla scared the central bankers senseless. They knew what his plan meant. Energy independence meant an almost complete loss of control of the people.”</p>
<p>Tesla fought in the trenches, pulling back curtains on the PSQ—on humanity versus tyranny, freedom versus slavery. Profit from death and destruction—perpetual war fueled by fossil energy. Private central banking’s “ . . . continuous consolidation of wealth and power into higher, tighter and righter hands” (GHW Bush quote). Continuous consolidation of wealth in the fewest hands drives debt slavery, genocide, looting of the future, the “New World Order.”</p>
<p>“If we don’t exploit every resource with alacrity and no mercy, our competitors will”—that’s the apparent creed of the PSQ. Sugary platitudes regarding people yet to be born seem vulgar in light of the PSQ twisting future generations into competitors. First come, first served. A penny stolen is a penny earned.</p>
<p>Imagine “free” energy.</p>
<p>Imagine no contrived shortages and price gouging. No ”gas” tanks, power lines, meters, power bills, wars for oil and pipeline routes, Alberta tar and Keystone XL kinds of high-pressure DilBit arteries of death—imagine some of the PSQ’s worst nightmares. Toss in no climate-changing hydrocarbon pollution, no more churning out mountains of radioactive waste to attack the human genome for thousands of generations, no psychopathic domination by an invisible elite controlling what billions of people need to survive. Imagine modern warfare obsolete. [7] Tesla offered salvation from survival of the wickedest.</p>
<p>The wicked panicked . . .</p>
<p>Truth is the antidote for diseased wealth and propaganda smothering and mangling the best of Tesla. A rare step in the right direction would be millions of people realizing that Tesla really did not dedicate the second half of his life to making bigger and ever-more-“Awesome!” sparks—but rather, he was absolutely dedicated to freedom of humanity. Tesla’s greatest invention being reduced to a toy for “ . . . entertainment and educational displays”—that’s very potent PSQ mind venom. They even tagged Tesla the “God of Lightning.” Can’t beat lightning for “Awesome!” sparks. Can’t beat the PSQ for . . . perhaps W.C. Fields said it best: “There comes a time in the affairs of man, when we must take the bull by the tail, and face the situation.” The “bull” in this case is the PSQ; the situation is what blasts from under the bull’s tail to foul humanity, and our nest.</p>
<p>Do we still have, if we ever did have, the mettle to wake up and rub the PSQ’s nose in their foulness? The stakes have never been higher.</p>
<p><strong>The sin of competition</strong></p>
<p>A quote variously attributed to both J.D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan set the stage for maniacal fouling of Tesla: “Competition is a sin.” [8]</p>
<p>Chutzpah of these two “tycoons’” implies that monopoly is divine—especially monopoly on energy, money, food, fresh water, and war; a “royal flush” in this Earthly game of poker.</p>
<p>Consider our nightmare of perpetual war in terms of this quote from Aldous Huxley, author of the novel, <em>Brave New World</em><em>:</em> “The propagandist’s purpose is to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human.”</p>
<p>Lies are the foundation of the PSQ’s reaction to Nikola Tesla. It’s paramount to humanity that freethinkers survive the elite and witness epiphany of this wisdom from Buddha: “The lie tastes sweet at the beginning, but bitter at the end. The truth tastes bitter at the beginning, but sweet at the end.”</p>
<p><strong>“Tesla’s Coil” versus “The Tesla Coil”</strong></p>
<p>The jungle of confusion and suppression of Tesla’s masterpiece might be easier to navigate if we distinguish between “<strong>Tesla’s Coil</strong>,” and the “Tesla Coil.” The former could be the epitome of human invention, the latter is its neutered caricature. For elaboration on this distinction, let’s check in with Zionist propaganda, the richest kind.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is hailed by Zionist Israel as “ . . . the major source of information in the world.” They even advertise, with standard Zionist chutzpah, that Wikipedia is “ . . . under constant, paid review of Zionist assets.” [9]</p>
<p>Below is Wikipedia’s first three paragraphs (underlining added) for their listing: “Tesla Coil” (as opposed to “<strong>Tesla’s Coil</strong>”):</p>
<p>“A Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit invented by Nikola Tesla around 1891. It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity.</p>
<p>“Tesla coils can produce higher voltages than other artificial sources of high-voltage discharges, electrostatic machines. Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.</p>
<p>“Tesla used these coils to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, x-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires. Tesla coil circuits were used commercially in sparkgap radio transmitters for wireless telegraphy until the 1920s, and in pseudomedical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices. Today their main use is for entertainment and educational displays.”</p>
<p>Please note the use of “high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity,” and, “high frequency alternating current phenomena,” topped off with, “Today their main use is for entertainment and educational displays.” In terms of what Tesla actually achieved—in terms of transcendent capabilities of “<strong>Tesla’s Coil</strong>,” Wikipedia’s “Tesla Coil” definition could not be more misleading if Wikipedia’s goal was to mislead.</p>
<p>Smell a rat? Tesla has offered to show us that rats don’t always win.</p>
<p>Regarding Wikipedia’s, “Today their main use is for entertainment and educational displays” . . . this is a naked example of Wikipedia’s Zionist-propaganda roots, and propagation of twisted truth.</p>
<p>Frank Zappa characterized America’s educational system as a mechanism designed to create “ . . . functional ignorance.”</p>
<p>Disguised as an educational system, America’s youth indoctrination system also gets a nod in Wikipedia’s line about the “Tesla Coil” being for “ . . . entertainment and educational displays.”</p>
<p>Entertainment, surely, but educational? Entertainment and indoctrination are more accurate here; the “Tesla Coil” is hailed while “<strong>Tesla’s Coil</strong>” is . . . what, “conspiracy theory”?</p>
<p>We suffer severe multi-generational distress when “education” is largely indoctrination aimed at inhibiting independent thinking. Students memorize dogma sanctioned by the PSQ so they can pass standardized tests sanctioned by the PSQ. Students learning to think for themselves, learning how to distinguish truth from dogma—this will not do. The PSQ wants young minds regurgitating hive thinking in preparation for becoming obedient workers in thrall of authority, wingless and weighed-down by leaden dogma planted in their minds by PSQ ovipositors.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla’s “Wheelwork of Nature”</strong></p>
<p>While the primary function of the contrived “Tesla Coil” is to disengage Tesla’s masterpiece from reality, the primary function of “<strong>Tesla’s Coil</strong>” is to disengage voltage from current—disengage “the true electricity” (Aether) from the flow of massive electrons. Only when <em>zero current</em> is achieved in “<strong>Tesla’s Coil</strong>” will Aether flow freely and the “Tesla Effect” be realized. Any flow of electrons chokes off the Aether. It’s no coincidence that the awesome-spark-toy “Tesla Coil” has popularly replaced “Tesla’s Coil” to choke off Tesla’s threat to the PSQ.</p>
<p>Tesla’s inspiration regarding the decoupling of voltage and current grew during his brief employment by Thomas Edison.</p>
<p>Edison’s DC power distribution system was so inefficient that power-line resistance would cause voltage to fade within several city blocks. Voltage was cranked up very high at the main generators, and “pumping stations” were required every half mile to boost sagging voltage and current.</p>
<p>When a main switch was thrown to hit transmission lines with cranked-up voltage right off the main generators, a blast of blue and purple spikes and stinging, shocking sensations radiated in all directions from the transmission lines before electrons (current) flowed in the lines. This instantaneous phenomenon actually killed some linesmen. Engineers considered these bursts of magnified electrostatic potential a nuisance to be eliminated. Tesla saw them as a powerful, mysterious form of energy to be explored.</p>
<p><strong>In Part Two:</strong></p>
<p>● Tesla and the Earth (his laboratory)</p>
<p>● “<strong>Tesla’s Coil</strong>” (the real thing)</p>
<p>● The “Tesla Effect”</p>
<p>● Aether’s “whitefire” fountains and “mass-free cold electricity”</p>
<p>● Wardenclyffe without propaganda</p>
<p>● Tesla allowed a cameo appearance in the Smithsonian</p>
<p>● Eric Dollard’s eight destroyed laboratories, and why a most profound and honorable way to help humanity, Earth, and generations to come is also the most dangerous</p>

<p>There are many forms of government subsidies. Ambitious politicians ingeniously design schemes to expand their power and repay their donor patrons. Opportunist corporate enterprises beg for favor to fund projects or guaranteed loans. The role of government venture capitalism has produced a much-sordid record for the taxpayer. The sheer concept of picking winners and losers is a pure political play that defies pragmatic prudence. In spite of this, actuality, the rush to squander public money is one of the few growth industries. The pitiful results of the predictable bankruptcy are the common fate of this flawed business model.</p>
<p>The latest outrage has <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/511576/buyers-circle-around-ailing-fisker-automotive/">Buyers Circle Around Ailing Fisker Automotive</a>. Yet, some critics of this assessment would have you believe that Fisker Automotive is in a sharp contrast to competitor Tesla Motors.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But the fact that potential buyers are from China is already raising alarms about Fisker, which raised $1.2 billion in venture capital and spent about $192 million in federal loans to build a factory. &#8220;Technology developed with American taxpayer subsidies should not be sold off to China,&#8221; Republican senator Charles Grassley told Bloomberg. He compared it to the acquisition of A123 Systems by China-based auto parts company Wanxiang Group.</p>
<p>By contrast, Tesla Motors, which also received a DOE loan to build its factory, is crossing into higher volume production. Yesterday, Tesla announced that it expects to be profitable this quarter and is making its Model S at a rate of 400 a month, which will allow it to hit its annual target and meet demand for the electric sedan. (See, Tesla&#8217;s Explosive Revenue Suggests a Bright Future.)</p>
<p>One crucial difference between Tesla and Fisker, which is well known for its bold designs, has been Tesla&#8217;s manufacturing expertise. Fisker may well still go public and be a successful EV supplier. But for energy-related startups to go the route of Tesla rather than Fisker, they&#8217;ll need innovative technology, access to capital, supportive policies, and great business execution.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Obama environmental cult would argue that it is largely appropriate to spend public resources to fund private technological businesses. Some will be successful while others will fail. However, the partnership role with government in this new state/capitalist prototype is necessary to achieve the greater good of a fossil free ecosystem. Expensive cars, not designed for the commuter, are now joint venture public finance missions, in order to curtail gas fumes.</p>
<p>Henry Ford is rolling in his grave and Enzo Ferrari is searching for the electric switch.</p>
<p>The notorious &#8220;Green&#8221; sector has vivid examples of bribery, theft, incompetence and high-priced inefficient technology. The Foundry publishes a most informative list of<a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2012/10/18/president-obamas-taxpayer-backed-green-energy-failures/">President Obama’s Taxpayer-Backed Green Energy Failures</a>. &#8220;So far, 34 companies that were offered federal support from taxpayers are faltering — either having gone bankrupt or laying off workers or heading for bankruptcy.&#8221; Examine the specific site links for expanded details.</p>

<p>Now expand the creativity of the subsidy culture to the bankruptcy constituency. The report, <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2013/02/21/union-that-bankrupted-hostess-to-receive-generous-government-subsidies/">Union That Bankrupted Hostess to Receive Generous Government Subsidies</a>, will push you over the edge.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Last year, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2012/11/16/no-more-twinkies-unions-to-blame/">refused to accept concessions</a> that would have kept Hostess in business. The company had tried to cut costs as it faced <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2012/01/10/twinkies-kodak-bailouts-and-the-free-market/">high labor expenses</a>, rising ingredient costs, and decreasing sales. The Teamsters union accepted the concessions, but the Bakery union would not, choosing to strike. Unable to continue operating, Hostess filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Now those who helped bring down an American icon will receive generous, taxpayer-funded benefits from the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. These <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/05/trade-adjustment-assistance-dont-link-the-costly-and-ineffective-program-to-free-trade-agreements">generous benefits</a> come <em>in addition</em> to existing unemployment insurance, job placement, and job training programs. TAA benefits include:</p>
<blockquote><p>
• Up to two years of job training in an approved training program,</p>
<p>• Up to 52 weeks of Trade Readjustment Allowances for workers in job training,</p>
<p>• Job search and relocation allowances,</p>
<p>• A refundable &#8220;health care tax credit&#8221; that covers 65 percent of a worker’s health insurance premiums in qualifying health plans, and</p>
<p>• A two-year wage insurance program that partly replaces workers’ earnings if they accept lower-paying jobs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The civic grant philosophy is not just for corporatists. Union goons prefer that their rank in file lose their livelihood, so that they can enjoy the welfare stipends of the state-run insolvent society. The prospects of a Mandarin logo on a Fisker vehicle are hardly on the same scale of transferring innovative technology to Cantonese creditors. However, the common practice of squandering national treasure for dubious purposes seems to be the primary product of the political careerists.</p>
<p>Leave it to the progressives over at The American Prospect, for an unintended analogy, in the essay <a href="http://prospect.org/article/twinkie-defense">The Twinkie Defense</a> - <em>the unions made us do it</em>. &#8220;Hostess Brands is classic case of private equity engineers and executives looting a viable company, loading it up with debt, and then asking the employees to make up the difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regretfully, but with no remorse; the political class plays the role of <em>private equity engineers</em>, as the government plunders our economy, through crony spending and swelling of the debt, while saddling the taxpayer with the bill.</p>

<p>The technological miracle that transformed the 20th century into an engine of wealth creation was based upon cheap energy. The role of the electric grid cannot be understated when it comes to enhancing the quality of life for the greatest number of people. The advance of civilization often seems to go in reverse gear. However, the innovation of labor saving devices and productive machinery usually rely upon running on the stream from electric generation.</p>
<p>Even with this laudable accomplishment, the electric grid has fundamental flaws and distribution shortcomings. The challenge for the 21th century requires a re-invention of thinking as much as a technological replacement of the alternative current system of connection to the electric grid.</p>
<p>Peter Fairley reveals an important trend in <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427504/edisons-revenge-the-rise-of-dc-power/">Edison&#8217;s Revenge: The Rise of DC Power</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Anything that uses transistors relies on direct current, the flow of electricity in one direction. That explains why PCs, iPhones, and flat-screen TVs all have converter boxes to turn the alternating current in wall sockets (which reverses direction 120 times a second) into direct current.</p>
<p>Such digital consumer devices account for up to a fifth of total power consumption today, according to Greg Reed, director of the Power &amp; Energy Initiative at the University of Pittsburgh. Reed says the steep growth curve of DC power is due not only to computers but also to the spread of devices such as LEDs and solar panels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within the next 20 years we could definitely see as much as 50 percent of our total loads be made up of DC consumption,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s accelerating even more than we&#8217;d expected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>DC power is a far more practical method of generation if a consumer is determined to severe the cord with your local electric utility. The obvious drawback is that in the United States major appliances are all designed to run on AC. If one is resolute to become independent in electric creation, the practical sources of generating a usable current requires a substantial redesign of a wiring system and a substantial investment of capital for the privilege of telling the electric company to take their bill and stuff it.</p>
<p>Is this emotional determination realistic when most people reside in metropolitan regions? Now if you are an avid &#8220;<a href="http://prepper.org/">Prepper</a>&#8221; and have secured the ideal isolated and rural location to build your dream castle retreat, by all means, do your own thing.The reality is that reliability of consistent power is one of the main advantages of connecting to the grid. Sure power- outages increase as the lack of proper maintenance to the transmission grid deteriorates. But the alternative of a fickle wind turbine in a still sky means you better be lighting with candles. With all the shortcomings and the short life of battery storage systems, the joy of being free of the utility company may well mean converting to a 19th century hand well pump for your water and a wood stove for your heat.</p>
<p>Now many hi-tech inventions allow the self-reliant to enjoy the natural pleasures of a back to nature lifestyle. Thermoelectric generators (<a href="http://tegpower.com/">TEG</a>) might even work if you can master the technology of generating small amounts of electric current from the energy of your wood or coal furnace. Or, if you did your due diligence in selecting that prime survivalist fortress, with a dependable water flow from a year round stream, you can consider a <a href="http://www.absak.com/library/hydro-power">micro-hydro power systems</a>. If you strike out with your current incompatible location, surely you can sling a few solar panels on your roof to boil your morning cup of coffee.The point is that the actual alternatives to generating a practical level of power independent from a grid connection, can be achieved by few property owners.</p>
<p>Now before you give up and order your <a href="http://stopsmartmeters.org/2012/07/11/pge-attempts-to-muzzle-incriminating-details-emerging-from-widening-smart-meter-spy-scandal/">PG&amp;E smart meter</a>, the definite scandal has little to do with guaranteeing a cost effective electric utility system. Note the main concern has to do with your health and privacy. &#8220;Civil liberties advocates are watching this case and asking if we can’t trust the utility industry not to read our e-mails and spy on us, how can we trust them not to share details of our private lives that they acquire from the smart meter?&#8221;As the emphasis of the alternative energy debate shifts solely from methods to dominance, one must admit that the electric grid is presently being used to control your household existence. The idea of allowing individual homeowners to live their lives free from <a href="http://www.dps.ny.gov/">Public Service Commission</a> control is only an academic issue. With modern living, in the &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/041810.html">Green</a>&#8221; politically correct era, the only thing that can be counted on is a move towards a despotic government mandate that forces compliance to the &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/042510.html">Cap and Trade</a>&#8221; culture.</p>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/exhibit20.gif" /></p>
<p>Going off the grid is far more a political matter than a primitive attempt to supercharge your energy independence by perfecting the recluse way of life. We are all in the same electromagnetic pulse (EMP) matrix that threatens to severe the electric life raft. Reverting to a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature">Hobbesian State of Nature</a> in an age of comprehensive surveillance that runs on electric current will not cure the autocratic lightening strike.How can real and viable electric alternatives be developed and brought to market when the entire bureaucratic system rests upon enforcing arbitrary regulations for favored crony relationships? Proponents of &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/view/072411.html">Sustainable Energy</a>&#8221; worship a bogus deity. Their doctrine requires the elimination of coal altogether. With the rapid increase of natural gas turbines for electric generation, these zealots demand that every fossil fuel must be abandoned.</p>
<p>Such attitudes directly have a negative impact on the grid. The case of industrial wind makes the point. A dramatic expansion of the current grid would be required to provide an interconnect from scattered wind factory locations. Just ask <a href="http://www.santangelsreview.com/2011/05/21/t-boone-pickens-abandons-wind-for-natural-gas/">Boone Pickens</a>why he deserted his flirtation with this outdated, unreliable and inefficient wind generation in favor of natural gas.Home fuel cell technology to power your home offers independence from the grid, but any system that requires a cogeneration source of fuel (like propane or natural gas) has obvious economic drawbacks. The promise of producing electricity from magnet generation has a striking appeal. However, where is the practical model that can be tested and marketed at your local Home Depot?</p>
<p>Sorry, the facts all support a conclusion that for a complex society with an aging infrastructure and an authoritarian political culture, the will to invest in a different electrical distribution system does not exist. It is not even a question of developing a better method for connection; it is all about stretching the useful life of old technology. Where is <a href="http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_todre.html">Nikola Tesla</a> when you really need him? Well, the modern day J P Morgan’s that control the utility grid have a decisive foreign ownership composition. When the likes of <a href="http://www.iberdrolarenewables.us/">Iberdrola</a> and <a href="https://www1.nationalgridus.com/CorporateHub">National Grid</a> are encouraged to buy up our domestic electrical utilities, the prospects for the future mirror the problems of Europe.So if you are not a Prepper and you reside in your urban Florida condominium, be prepared to survive without air conditioning, if you want to cancel your utility account. The regulatory agencies are rubber stamps for the &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/071512.html">Corporatists</a>&#8221; utilities and citizen groups have an uphill struggle in preventing a wholesale stranglehold on your energy availability.</p>
<p>Organizing community electric cooperatives with citizen utility boards may be the only way to combat the <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/071011.html">Agenda 21</a> goal of controlling and rationing energy availability. The grid could be a miracle support line if it was under the stewardship of community interests. Decentralization of the grid, while maintaining access to sources of reliable and cost effective electric generation, should be the goal. Preventing brownouts is a technological issue, not an Enron manufactured by design occurrence.</p>
<p>The prospect of skyrocketing utility bills is a foregone reality if further consolidation is allowed. Without market competition not only in the sale of electricity, but in the delivery system of distribution, the costs of surviving your electric bill may be far more difficult.</p>
<p>Conservation is a logical objective. Notwithstanding such a noble aspiration, the financial requirements for return on equity demand that a reduction in usage demands an increase in electric rates. Only a true and practical energy generation invention that could break the ties of the electric meter, would offer any prospects of getting totally off the grid.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, major energy appliances will be manufactured for AC current. Anyone who has experience with portable generators for backup home generation know all too well that the price of gas or propane are excessive and prohibitive as a permanent alternative.</p>
<p>The only way to get the grid to work for you is to place maximum pressure on the political system to promote innovation for individual independence of the end user. DC current is the energy of choice for the greatest autonomy. However, the Washington DC connection is the greatest hurdle to overcome. The physics of Tesla’s wireless transmission of electrical energy is child’s play, when compared to the enigma of government regulation.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/barack-obama-drug-warrior3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/barack-obama-drug-warrior2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>We all know the difference between normal mistakes and those that hint at a deeper, more frightening problem, such as Alzheimer’s or another brain condition.  In light of this, how do you interpret a shocking mistake recently made by Barack Obama?  Writes Terry Jeffrey of <a href="http://cnsnews.com/blog/terence-p-jeffrey/obama-twice-mistakenly-mentions-my-sons-while-defending-contraception-mandate">CNS News</a>:</p>
<p>In two campaign speeches over the last two days, President Barack Obama has twice mistakenly mentioned &#8220;my sons&#8221; when defending his administration&#8217;s regulation requiring virtually all health-care plans in the United States to provide women, without any fees or co-pay, with sterilizations and all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives, including those that can cause abortions.</p>
<p>Given that Obama has, ostensibly, only daughters, where does such a mistake come from?  And how do you make it <em>twice on two different occasions</em> without correcting yourself?  Then again, how can an American president <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGH02DtIws">say</a>, “I’ve now been in 57 states, I think – one left to go” without correcting himself?  Yes, Obama’s most recent bizarre slip of the mind makes me think of that older, equally bizarre one.  I mean, there are mistakes.</p>
<p>Then there are <em>mistakes</em>.</p>
<p>After all, it’s ingrained in every American child when extremely little that our nation has 50 states.  Fifty states, fifty states, fifty states, fifty states….  It should just roll off the tongue – in just the way the word “daughters” should when girls are all you’ve ever had.</p>
<p>Of course, this invites the quip – and it’s a good example of how there’s some truth behind every joke – that “American child” never described Obama, at least not in spirit.  But another possibility suggests itself:</p>
<p>Is Barack Obama brain-damaged?</p>
<p>I’m not just being a wise-guy.  With the president’s admitted past drug use and the recent revelations about how he was a member of the “Choom Gang” in high school, is it hard to imagine that he might have damaged his mind through the abuse of recreational drugs?</p>
<p>“Choom,” by the way, is slang for smoking marijuana.  And it seems that this gang activity was Obama’s favorite extra-curricular option in high school.  Writes ABC News’ <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/obama-and-his-pot-smoking-choom-gang/">Jonathan Karl</a>:</p>
<p>In his 1995 memoir “Dreams of My Father,” Obama writes about smoking pot almost like Dr. Seuss wrote about eating green eggs and ham.  As a high school kid, Obama wrote, he would smoke “in a white classmate’s sparkling new van,” he would smoke “in the dorm room of some brother” and he would smoke “on the beach with a couple of Hawaiian kids.”</p>
<p>He would smoke it here and there.  He would smoke it anywhere.</p>
<p>Yes, I do like it, Uncle Scam I am.  In fact, as the Choom Gang story goes, Obama was a veritable Nikola Tesla of weed use who would actually start “pot-smoking trends.”  Add to this a diversity in drug inclinations that led him to dabble also in hard drugs, and perhaps it explains the soft head.</p>
<p>Of course, as for calling girls “sons,” there are other explanations.  Perhaps Obama is like those parents who don’t want to sex stereotype their children and thus are very pleased when their son dresses as a girl; maybe he’ll now refer to Malia and Sasha as sons half the time.  Perhaps he subscribes to the fashionable LBGT idea that “gender” is all a matter of perception.  Heck, apparently he already believes that one’s ideology and economic model needn’t have a relationship to reality.</p>
<p>Then, American Thinker editor Thomas Lifson theorizes that the explanation may be that Obama is hiding more than just a sordid past, <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2012/05/what_the.html">writing</a>:</p>
<p>It has never occurred to me that Barack Obama might have a second secret family, as Charles Kurault did, hidden from his first family (pardon the pun) and the general public.  I still find this hard to believe.</p>
<p>But what kind of brain freeze or derangement leads someone to refer to my sons, when two daughters are the only fruit of conception one has created?</p>
<p>Perhaps the freeze symptomatic of a fried brain?</p>
<p>Then again, Dr. Lifson could be right.  Maybe Obama had more of a reason than we think to say that if he had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.</p>
<p>All joking aside, the only thing we can know for sure about Obama is that he’s a very bizarre man.  He had an absentee father, and, in his high-school yearbook, he acknowledged a drug dealer but not his quasi-absentee mother.  He seems to have received more ideology than love, as he was mentored by communist-party member Frank Marshall Davis, was drawn to Marxist professors in college and was a member of the socialist New Party in the 1990s.  And when you consider this, it’s not surprising that he turned to drugs during adolescence: it’s what kids with troubled upbringings often do.</p>
<p>As to this, C.S. Lewis once wrote something very profound about the significance of upbringing:</p>
<p>No justification of virtue will enable a man to be virtuous.  Without the aid of trained emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism.  I had sooner play cards against a man who was quite skeptical about ethics, but bred to believe that “a gentleman does not cheat”, than against an irreproachable moral philosopher who had been brought up among sharpers.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know for sure how scarred, in mind and soul, Obama is as a result of his bizarre youth.  But should we continue to take the chance of letting him playAmerica’s hand?</p>

Throughout space there is energy.</em>  &#8212; Nikola Tesla, 1892<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death.  Was he for real? A crackpot? Part of an early experiment in corporate-government control?</p>
<p>We know that he was undoubtedly persecuted by the energy power brokers of his day &#8212; namely Thomas Edison, whom we are taught in school to revere as a genius.  He was also attacked by J.P. Morgan and other &#8220;captains of industry.&#8221; Upon Tesla&#8217;s death on January 7th, 1943, the U.S. government moved into his lab and apartment confiscating all of his scientific research, and to this day none of this research has been made public.</p>
<p>Besides his persecution by corporate-government interests (which is practically a certification of authenticity), there is at least one solid indication of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s integrity &#8212; he tore up a contract with Westinghouse that was worth billions in order to save the company from paying him his huge royalty payments.</p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s take a look at what Nikola Tesla &#8212; a man who died broke and alone &#8212; has actually given to the world.  For better or worse, with credit or without, he changed the face of the planet in ways that perhaps no man ever has.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><strong>1. Alternating Current</strong> &#8211; This is where it all began, and what ultimately caused such a stir at the 1893 World&#8217;s Expo in Chicago.  A war was leveled ever-after between the vision of Edison and the vision of Tesla for how electricity would be produced and distributed.  The division can be summarized as one of cost and safety: The DC current that Edison (backed by General Electric) had been working on was costly over long distances, and produced dangerous sparking from the required converter (called a commutator).  Regardless, Edison and his backers utilized the general &#8220;dangers&#8221; of electric current to instill fear in Tesla&#8217;s alternative: Alternating Current.  As proof, Edison sometimes electrocuted animals at demonstrations.  Consequently, Edison gave the world the electric chair, while simultaneously maligning Tesla&#8217;s attempt to offer safety at a lower cost.  Tesla responded by demonstrating that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting current through his own body to produce light.  This Edison-Tesla (GE-Westinghouse) feud in 1893 was the culmination of over a decade of shady business deals, stolen ideas, and patent suppression that Edison and his moneyed interests wielded over Tesla&#8217;s inventions. Yet, despite it all, it is Tesla&#8217;s system that provides power generation and distribution to North America in our modern era.</p>
<p><strong>2. Light </strong>&#8211; Of course he didn&#8217;t invent light itself, but he did invent how light can be harnessed and distributed.  Tesla developed and used florescent bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry &#8220;invented&#8221; them. At the World&#8217;s Fair, Tesla took glass tubes and bent them into famous scientists&#8217; names, in effect creating the first neon signs.  However, it is his Tesla Coil that might be the most impressive, and controversial.  The Tesla Coil is certainly something that big industry would have liked to suppress: the concept that the Earth itself is a magnet that can generate electricity (electromagnetism) utilizing frequencies as a transmitter.  All that is needed on the other end is the receiver &#8212; much like a radio.</p>
<p><strong>3. X-rays &#8211; </strong>Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the late 1800s, but Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a precursor to <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/kirlian-photography-shows-organic.html">Kirlian photography</a>, which has the ability to document life force, to what we now use in medical diagnostics, this was a transformative invention of which Tesla <a href="http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/28/4/1189.full">played a central role</a>.  X-rays, like so many of Tesla&#8217;s contributions, stemmed from his belief that everything we need to understand the universe is virtually around us at all times, but we need to use our minds to develop real-world devices to augment our innate perception of existence.</p>
<p><strong>4. Radio</strong> &#8211; Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him to be the inventor of radio to this day.  However, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi&#8217;s patent in 1943, when it was proven that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi.  Radio signals are just another frequency that needs a transmitter and receiver, which Tesla also demonstrated in 1893 during a presentation before The National Electric Light Association.  In 1897 Tesla applied for two patents <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US645576" rel="nofollow"> US 645576</a>, and <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US649621" rel="nofollow">US 649621</a>. In 1904, however, The U.S. Patent Office reversed its decision, awarding Marconi a patent for the invention of radio, possibly influenced by Marconi&#8217;s financial backers in the States, who included Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie. This also allowed the U.S. government (among others) to avoid having to pay the royalties that were being claimed by Tesla.</p>
<p><strong>5. Remote Control</strong> &#8211; This invention was a natural outcropping of radio. Patent No.<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=0613809.PN.&amp;OS=PN/0613809&amp;RS=PN/0613809">613809</a> was the first remote controlled model boat, demonstrated in 1898.  Utilizing several large batteries; radio signals controlled switches, which then energized the boat&#8217;s propeller, rudder, and scaled-down running lights. While this exact technology was not widely used for some time, we now can see the power that was appropriated by the military in its pursuit of <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/6-technologies-for-de-humanizing-war.html">remote controlled war</a>. Radio controlled tanks were introduced by the Germans in WWII, and developments in this realm have since slid quickly away from the direction of human freedom.</p>
<p><strong>6. Electric Motor &#8211; </strong>Tesla&#8217;s invention of the electric motor has finally been popularized by <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">a car</a> brandishing his name.  While the technical specifications are beyond the scope of this summary, suffice to say that Tesla&#8217;s invention of a motor with rotating magnetic fields could have freed mankind much sooner from the stranglehold of Big Oil.  However, his invention in 1930 succumbed to the economic crisis and the world war that followed. Nevertheless, this invention has fundamentally changed the landscape of what we now take for granted: industrial fans, household applicances, water pumps, machine tools, power tools, disk drives, electric wristwatches and compressors.</p>
<p><strong>7. Robotics</strong> &#8211; Tesla&#8217;s overly enhanced scientific mind led him to the idea that all living beings are merely driven by external impulses.  He stated: &#8220;I have by every thought and act of mine, demonstrated, and does so daily, to my absolute satisfaction that I am an automaton endowed with power of movement, which merely responds to external stimuli.&#8221;  Thus, the concept of the robot was born.  However, an element of the human remained present, as Tesla asserted that these human replicas should have limitations &#8212; namely growth and propagation. Nevertheless, Tesla unabashedly embraced all of what intelligence could produce.  His visions for a future filled with intelligent cars, robotic human companions, and the use of sensors, and autonomous systems are detailed in a must-read entry in the <a href="http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=1451-48690603163V">Serbian Journal of Electrical Engineering, 2006 (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8. Laser</strong> &#8211; Tesla&#8217;s invention of the laser may be one of the best examples of the good and evil bound up together within the mind of man.  Lasers have transformed surgical applications in an undeniably beneficial way, and they have given rise to much of our current digital media. However, with this leap in innovation we have also crossed into the land of science fiction.  From Reagan&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; laser defense system to today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/12/orwellian-non-lethal-war-waged-against.html">Orwellian &#8220;non-lethal&#8221; weapons&#8217;</a> arsenal, which includes laser rifles and directed energy &#8220;death rays,&#8221; there is great potential for development in both directions.</p>
<p><strong>9 and 10. Wireless Communications and Limitless Free Energy</strong> &#8211; These two are inextricably linked, as they were the last straw for the power elite &#8212; what good is energy if it can&#8217;t be metered and controlled?  Free?  Never.  J.P. Morgan backed Tesla with $150,000 to build a tower that would use the natural frequencies of our universe to transmit data, including a wide range of information communicated through images, voice messages, and text.  This represented the world&#8217;s first wireless communications, but it also meant that aside from the cost of the tower itself, the universe was filled with free energy that could be utilized to form a world wide web connecting all people in all places, as well as allow people to harness the free energy around them.  Essentially, the 0&#8242;s and 1&#8242;s of the universe are embedded in the fabric of existence for each of us to access as needed.  Nikola Tesla was dedicated to empowering the individual to receive and transmit this data virtually free of charge.  But we know the ending to that story . . . until now?</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" alt="" align="left" />Tesla had perhaps thousands of other ideas and inventions that remain unreleased.  A look at his <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yvwev4">hundreds of patents</a> shows a glimpse of the scope he intended to offer.  If you feel that the additional technical and scientific research of Nikola Tesla should be revealed for public scrutiny and discussion, instead of suppressed by big industry and even our supposed <a href="http://poorrichards-blog.blogspot.com/2011/12/history-of-mits-blatant-suppression-of.html">institutions of higher education</a>, please <strong><a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/%21/petition/release-nikola-teslas-technical-and-scientific-research/S9CjXwh5">sign this petition</a></strong> to demand that power brokers everywhere learn that we are ready to Occupy Energy and learn about what our universe really has to offer.</p>
<p>The release of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s technical and scientific research &#8212; specifically his research into harnessing electricity from the ionosphere at a facility called Wardenclyffe &#8212; is a necessary step toward true freedom of information.  The petition has a goal of 25,000 signatures and needs your support, but whether or not it is reached please continue to add your voice by sharing this information with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>A Facebook event page for the official call on January 7th, the anniversary of Tesla&#8217;s death, can be found here:  <a title="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332" dir="ltr" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332</a></p>
<p>For additional information about the demand for release, please visit:<a title="http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/" dir="ltr" href="http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/</a></p>
<p>As they state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tell your friends, bring it up and discuss it at your next general assembly, do whatever you can to get the word out, organize locally to make a stand for the release of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s research&#8230;. America is tired of corrupt corporate greed, supported by The American government, holding us back in a stagnant society in the name of profit . . . The Energy Crisis is a lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an aside: there are some who have pointed out that Tesla&#8217;s experimentation with the ionosphere very well could have caused the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~onichelson/ONichelsonTUNGUSKA.pdf">massive explosion over Tunguska, Siberia in 1908,</a> which leveled an estimated 60 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers, and may even have led to the much maligned <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/08/weather-wars-and-devils-haarp.html">HAARP</a> technology.  I submit that we would do well to remember that technology is never the true enemy; it is the <em>misuse</em> of technology that can enslave rather than free mankind from its animal-level survivalism.</p>
<p>Please view the video below, which does an excellent job at personalizing this largely forgotten human being, as well as show the reasons why to this day he is not a household name.</p>

<p>And here is a video that offers an essential alternative view of ancient Egypt and other cultures that employed pyramidal structures, which suggests the staggering outer limits of what Tesla was attempting to harness and offer to humanity:</p>

<p><strong>Mainstream Explanations:</strong> Lightning, hail, mid-air collision,  power lines, and New Year fireworks for the birds . . . but disease for  the fish.  This is even rolling eyes in the mainstream media.  Birds are  incredibly sensitive to their environment (think Canary in the coal  mine), and the thought that they were caught by surprise, or that they  &#8220;fowled&#8221; up their flight pattern is patently ridiculous.  And where are  the roasted birds from this lightning strike?  And what about fish dying  in the same region?  Just a &#8220;disease&#8221; coincidence.  One mainstream  headline has to be enshrined as the saddest attempt at sensationalism,  while revealing an obvious natural conclusion <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/03/arkansas.falling.birds/index.html">Falling Birds Likely Died From Massive Trauma</a>.  Really?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><strong>Meteor showers:</strong> We are in a period of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantids">intense seasonal meteor showers</a>,  and several perennial YouTubers reported <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/2010TheCountdown#p/u/6/NRcqgn4dFh0">hearing sonic booms</a> in the area  that could have indicated a local <a href="http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/meteor.html">shock wave</a>.    This would be one non-conspiratorial, natural cause that actually  makes  sense, but it is hard to connect to both birds and fish, unless  it  produced a disabling frequency.  There were indeed other sound  anomalies according to the report highlighted above.</p>
<p><strong>New Madrid Fault Line:</strong> An excellent article by The American Dream collated data about the <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/is-the-new-madrid-fault-earthquake-zone-coming-to-life">recent earthquake activity</a> along this fault line that runs along the mid-eastern section of the U.S.  Combined with <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/01/penn-allows-gas-fracking-waste-to-be.html">gas fracking,</a> the immense geological activity in the region, and the BP oil drilling   disaster, which off-gassed the dispersant, Corexit, into the  atmosphere, and we should be wondering about any mass deaths in the  region.  Nevertheless, this has turned into a global event, so the above  could be a side effect of something larger, or a direct contributing  factor.</p>
<p><strong>Government testing:</strong> The long history of government testing has   been exposed by many <a href="http://www.infowars.com/is-mass-bird-and-fish-die-off-connected-to-government-testing/">researchers</a>.   The strange component to this die-off   is that only certain species  have been affected, but within the entire  region.  And some reports  have indicated that the organs of these birds  were liquefied, which  could indicate a possible virus. Could this implicate  species-specific  bio-weapons? It is on record that discussions have  taken place about <a href="http://www.peace.ca/racetargetablebioweapons.htm">race-specific bio-weapons</a>; perhaps this is a test of delivery capability?</p>
<div><a href="http://activistpost.net/organicfood.html" target="_blank"> </a></div>
<p><strong>GMO mutation:</strong> Mike Adams of Natural News sets forth an <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/030914_dead_fish_birds.html">interesting theory</a>:  this latest event is local, but the die-offs are happening across  species as bee populations and bats are also declining.  Adams points  out that Monsanto has a corporate office in Arkansas.  Just wondering.</p>
<p><strong>Geoengineering:</strong> Could spraying in the area have caused this type  of fallout?  Perhaps something new added to the mixture? Chemtrails have  quickly moved from conspiracy theory to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-World-Are-They-Spraying/dp/B00483VQTE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=permacultucom-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">documented fact</a>.   So much so, that the powers-that-be have had to admit to the program,  but a beneficial one in their view.  Between cloud seeding and possible  connections to HAARP, chemtrail fallout must be considered, especially  as it is being conducted nearly worldwide.  Rosalind Peterson has been  at the forefront of <a href="http://www.agriculturedefensecoalition.org/?q=agriculture">connecting geoengineering to GMOs</a> as a combined source for oxygen-depleting algae blooms that very well  could affect a wide spectrum of natural systems. Furthermore, some  believe that the delivery system for chemtrails can also disperse  pathogens.  If there is a flu or disease outbreak in the coming days or  weeks among the human population in areas where the birds have fallen,  the chemtrail connection could be made.  If this happens, the contagion  could be blamed on a new, deadly bird flu.  A last possibility connected  to chemtrails would be nanoparticles.</p>
<p><strong>HAARP:</strong> Birds and fish can be susceptible to subtle frequency  alteration.  An interesting YouTube post from a long-time fisherman  mentioned the <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/01/why-drum-fish-in-arkansas-are-effected.html">&#8220;pearl&#8221; plate</a> behind the eye of the affected type of drum fish in this event.  He  made a plea for anyone in the area to look for signs of damage to this  plate.  Both birds and fish navigate in highly coordinated ways that  indicate that they move and communicate via frequencies.  Could the <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/08/weather-wars-and-devils-haarp.html">HAARP array in Alaska</a> have short-circuited their navigation systems?  Or, perhaps this is the  beginning of a cascading effect from decades of electromagnetic  pollution emanating from EMF and ELF waves shot around the planet via a  wide range of modern communications.</p>
<p><strong>Scalar Weapons: </strong>These directed energy beam weapons can be deployed via satellite and create a wide range of &#8220;natural disasters&#8221; that can be <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/2056635-experts-suspect-scalar-weapons-testing-caused-mass-bird-and-fish-deaths">tuned to certain frequencies</a>.   Their radius is reported to be several miles.  Even crazier is that we  have been told that the dead birds encountered massive trauma.  One of  the reported abilities of scalar weapons is to create a <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/oz/cv/scalarweapons.html">Tesla shield</a> of plasma, like a bubble, that could explode anything that enters its  airspace.  Some have speculated that this technology is in full  operation.  But what if it truly is still at the testing phase?   Remember, this is <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/01/thousands-of-birds-fall-dead-in-south.html">happening in South America</a>, too.</p>
<p><strong>Project Blue Beam:</strong> Were they testing a sound generator for the  global theater of alien invasion?  This one is &#8220;out there&#8221; for sure, but  NASA itself has announced its preparation for such a scenario. <a href="http://www.wariscrime.com/2009/01/18/news/project-blue-beam-step-one-economic-disaster/">Project Blue Beam</a>,  like its counterpart HAARP, uses the natural energy present in the  ionosphere as both a visual and acoustical device.  Again, perhaps they  are not at the ready stage yet, but, <a href="http://prometheus.al.ru/english/phisik/onichelson/tunguska.htm">like Tesla</a>, have made an unintentional misstep.</p>
<p><strong>Geomagnetic and other Earth changes:</strong> As anyone can see from the  above range of possibilities, we are facing an array of human  tampering.  However, the backdrop to this are the anomalies beginning to  take form with the apparent wandering of our magnetic pole, as even <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/12/091224-north-pole-magnetic-russia-earth-core.html">National Geographic reported</a> that the north magnetic pole is racing toward Russia.  Add to this a dwindling magnetosphere and <a href="http://www.earthfrenzyradio.com/planet-in-peril/stunned-scientists-warn-of-dwindling-oxygen.html">falling oxygen levels</a>, and the deaths among more delicate species might portend a larger problem.  Finally, an increase in sun activity and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/magnetic/animals.html">magnetic storms</a> might be weakening our overall natural habitat.</p>
<p>The widespread die-off of nature should lead us to look more intently at  the world around us, and to question our relationship to it, and our  effect upon it. Perhaps this is what we should have been doing all  along.</p>

			<p><strong>US, Citizens of the world&#8217;s Greatest Nation?</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/repent2.jpg" alt="Repent" />“The universe is a moral realm, and every atom in all creation is  God-created.  Men can never sidestep  the religious and moral issues of life; they can blind themselves to them, and  regularly do, but this is comparable to a blind man walking on high cliffs  without even a cane in hand.” Dr. R. J. Rushdoony, “Sovereignty”.</p>
<p>Losers are not popular.  Winners write glowing descriptions of  victories while the detail of dissent is often lost.  Patriotism has surrounded our founding  documents and given them a sacrosanctity that defies reality.  Used as an occasional political verity  our Constitution is regularly ignored by our government but revered by many  Christians and patriots.  Elected  officials take an oath to “preserve, protect, and defend” it, it is quoted,  reprinted, and often referred to.   The Federalist papers, written in support of the Constitution by  promoters of strong centralized government, receive wide publicity while  anti-Federalist writings are overlooked.</p>
<p>There are many similarities between the process of yoking the original  thirteen colonies under a Federal government and the current process of yoking  the nations of the world under world government.  Subterfuge birthed both projects: The  Philadelphia Convention was convened for the purpose of amending the Articles of  Confederation; the new Constitution was a bait and switch tactic. New York  delegates Robert Yates and John Lansing left the convention and wrote the  Governor of New York as follows: “Our powers were explicit, and confined to the  sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation, and  reporting such alterations and provisions therein as should render the Federal  Constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of  the Union.”  <a href="http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/elliot/vol1/yateslansing.html" target="_blank">http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/elliot/vol1/yateslansing.html</a> Instead of a single bait and switch  tactic world government advocates are burglarizing the sovereignty of individual  nations.  Powerful minority business  and government interests promoted both procedures; initially in secret and  finally in public.  A least two high  level meetings took place before the Philadelphia Convention:  One at George Washington’s home at Mt.  Vernon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon_Conference" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon_Conference</a> and another at Annapolis.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_%281786%29" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_(1786)</a> World government meetings  at the Club  of Rome <a href="http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/home/" target="_blank">http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/home/</a> , the Council  on Foreign Relations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations</a> , and the Bilderbergs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group</a>,  are much larger but equally conspiratorial.</p>
<p>Though they feared tyrannical government individual freedom was far from  the minds of the leaders of the Philadelphia Convention.  Their concerns were for business and the  prestige of cohesive nationhood.  The new world order has similar  concerns.  Many of today’s threats  to freedom were anticipated by anti-Federalists <a href="http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/elliot/vol1/mason.html" target="_blank">http://teachingamericanhistory.org/ratification/elliot/vol1/mason.html</a> but the power structure  supported the Constitution just as today’s power structure supports world  government.</p>
<p>Congressman Ron Paul is the best thing that has happened in United States  politics for a long time.  His  lonely confrontational stance was a breath of fresh air in the political debates  of 2007 and many of his successive stands have been commendable.  In 2009, a scant two years following  massive press resistance to his agenda, he has become a sort of political  pop-icon.  He is enjoying a  renaissance.  Accurate economic  predictions have gained him the attention of political pundits and he has been  interviewed and taken seriously on a broad spectrum of public radio and  television programs.</p>
<p>Ironically, Congressman Paul, a Libertarian and small government  advocate, is an ardent supporter of the Constitution which was crafted and  successfully ratified by big government Federalists.  Contemporary Tea Party members provide  another irony: They, too, are ardent Constitutionalists even though a  significant supporter of the original Boston Tea Party, Samuel Adams <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams</a>, was an  anti-Federalist, who signed for ratification with great misgivings.</p>
<p>Discernment, one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, has been noticeably  missing in Christians.  Though they  believe that God is still on His throne they are reluctant to grant Him complete  sovereignty and are often confused on the exact definition of sin.  Some like to define sin as “separation  from God”.  Very few Christians  believe that sin is disobedience to God’s Commandments.  Some would contend that disobedience to  the Ten Commandments is sin but they reject God’s civil law as  anachronistic.  This theological  confusion has resulted in the untenable predicament of supporting and accepting  a secular government that uses its power to create laws that defy the written  Word of God.  Christians cannot  please God by supporting a wicked, pagan government.  A government that encodes laws that defy  God’s standards is Satanic and Christians who support it, even as the lesser of  two evils, are in partnership with the Devil.  Our nation is under the judgment of  Almighty God because we have failed to ally ourselves with the God of the Bible  choosing instead to misapply our faith by supporting evil politicians.</p>
<p>While Congressman Paul’s call for obedience to the Constitution would be  better than our present anarchy it would not remove God’s judgment.</p>
<p>Congressman Paul has some serious flaws that should be of concern to  every Christian.  First, his  solution to our dilemma is entirely humanistic.  He claims he would adhere to the  Constitution and shrink the size of government.  Even if he were elected to the  Presidency it would be a major hassle to get his miscreant colleagues in the  congress to support any of his plans. Second, He, like our Constitution, never  mentions God’s dominion over His creation.   He maintains membership in the evil Republican Party and even supports  their wicked candidates in his home state of Texas. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc8XRhcn1hY" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc8XRhcn1hY</a></p>
<p>Christians who conciliate with evil to gain a desired end are  pragmatists.  In humanism the end  justifies the means; in God’s kingdom the means must justify the end.  Pragmatic disobedience has been accepted  by people who claim the name of Christ and is a substantial reason for His  judgment.</p>
<p>Now, gentle reader, I understand that calls for repentance are unpopular  in a nation that is full of patriot people.  Humanists will continue to seek a  political solution but at this point Christians should begin to understand that  politics instead of being a solution to God’s anger is one of the causes.  There are no human solutions to the  degradation we have created.  We are  a wicked people living in a wicked nation and we are still puffed up with  unwarranted, arrogant patriotism.</p>
<p>While it is true that leaders bear a larger responsibility, Christians  who lend their support to ministries that fail to subordinate their church and  their congregation to the sovereignty of God by teaching and preaching humility,  obedience, confession, and repentance are equally responsible for the Judgment  we are under.  If we expect to avoid  the fate God promised Nineveh we must react as Nineveh and its leaders reacted!</p>
<p>Now, if you doubt the forgoing assessment please take a few minutes and  read this comparison between Russia and America written in broken English by a  Russian writer.  <a href="http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/111658-0/" target="_blank">http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/111658-0/</a> Ironic, isn’t it?</p>

			<p><strong>Part One of Two</strong></p>
<p><img src='http://www.novakeo.com/images/goldbarcash2.jpg' alt='gold and cash' class='alignnone' />On February 17, 1950, James Paul Warburg appeared before the U.S. Senate and declared: &#8220;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&#8221; <a name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>To establish a world government, it is necessary to incrementally eradicate the constitution, bring the U.S. to her knees economically, and shackle the taxpayers to perpetual debt through bailouts and stimulus packages funded by printing billions of dollars of interest and debt-bearing Federal Reserve Notes to drastically devalue the currency in circulation thus impoverishing the taxpayers. The only benefactors are the extant banks, certain corporations and the individuals who concocted the financial disaster.</p>
<p>The colonists issued debt-free script in the 1700s commensurate to the demands of trade and industry. The citizens were self-sufficient and industrious. Incensed over the currency issue, England burdened the colonists with excess taxes to fund Britain&#8217;s imperialistic wars. This precipitated the Revolutionary War. Alexander Hamilton, a Rothschild agent, convinced George Washington to allow the Rothschilds to finance the war. In 1791, with a big war debt to be paid, Hamilton set up a central bank, owned by the Rothschilds and other foreigners called the First Bank of the United States with a twenty-year charter. <a name="_ednref2" href="#_edn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Congress rejected renewal of the charter and the bank was closed on March 4, 1811. Nathan Rothschild was outraged and asked the British Parliament to declare war to reinstate the bank. The Prime Minister refused and was assassinated on May 11, 1812. Parliament declared war on June   18, 1812. British troops burned the White House and other government buildings including the one that housed the ratification papers for the U.S. constitution. The war increased our national debt from $45 million to $127 million. <a name="_ednref3" href="#_edn3">[3]</a> President Madison proposed the establishment of a second central bank on December 5, 1815 for a twenty year period. It was created by Congress on January 7, 1817. Nicholas Biddle, a Rothschild protégé, became the bank&#8217;s president in 1822. President Andrew Jackson refused to renew the charter in 1836, as promised during his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>In opposition to the international bankers, Abraham Lincoln issued debt-free, interest-free greenbacks through the Legal Tender Act of February 25, 1862. This currency funded the Civil War, a horrific, bloody battle that took the lives of over 600,000 souls and was devised to weaken and divide the country. The privately-owned Bank of England planned to impose a gold standard on the United States. Lincoln was soon assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Rothschild agent. No debt-free or interest-free money has been issued in America since then.</p>
<p>J. P. Morgan &amp; Company was founded in New York City in 1871 as Drexel, Morgan &amp; Company by J. Pierpont Morgan and Philadelphia banker Anthony Drexel, agents for Europeans investing in the United States. Ultimately, they were so well capitalized that they financed much of America&#8217;s industrial expansion. By the 1890s, Morgan became an industry consolidator, reorganizing and restructuring the debts of financially troubled railroads &#8211; the Northern Pacific, the Erie, the Reading and many other railroads for a total of one-sixth of the track in the U.S. Morgan financed and merged smaller companies to create U.S. Steel, International Harvester and others. A decline in competition results in a concentration of control. In 1904, J. P. Morgan &amp; Company loaned money to finance the Panama  Canal, the largest real estate transaction in history. J. P. Morgan &amp; Company became the world&#8217;s most powerful investment bank.</p>
<p>J. P. Morgan loaned money to Thomas Edison for his incandescent light research and therefore directed Edison&#8217;s power generation and distribution plants. Nikola Tesla (July 10, 1856 &#8211; January  7, 1943), a Serbian who later became a U.S. citizen, was fluent in seven languages. He patented the radio on March   20, 1900, a patent usurped and used by Marconi. Tesla needed the financing that the House of Morgan offered but wishing to retain independence, he resisted the accompanying control. He had witnessed the robber baron&#8217;s 1891 aggressive takeover of the struggling Thomson-Houston Company and the Edison Company to form General Electric. <a name="_ednref4" href="#_edn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Tesla had also witnessed how Morgan coveted and endangered the autonomy of Westinghouse. Morgan wanted Tesla to sign over his broad spectrum radio patents as security for the loans. Tesla had plans for a directed-energy weapon, not yet patented. Tesla proposed an end to all war. Tesla&#8217;s alternating current induction motor could have provided free, world-wide electricity to every human. Undoubtedly, Morgan, making huge profits from energy, wished to conceal that possibility. German born George H. Scherff Sr. served as Tesla&#8217;s accountant and assistant. When Tesla died, his vast collection of papers were seized and classified by the banker-obedient government. <a name="_ednref5" href="#_edn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>By the turn of the century, Americans paid very few taxes, had minimal debt and grew their businesses internally &#8211; without bank loans. However, by 1910, there were, throughout the country, a combination of over twenty thousand private banks and national banks, chartered by the federal government, all taking business away from the big New York City banks. Legally, banks were allowed to issue currency or bank notes. Since they operated on a fractional reserve system, they could lend out 90 percent of their deposits. This system is manageable unless demands for cash in the form of checks or depositor withdrawals are greater than their reserve cash. Many of those banks failed in orchestrated financial panics. Those remaining would be coerced to join the Federal Reserve System, soon to be established, where their reserves would be managed and controlled by a small, highly competitive, greedy group.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1910, six influential competitor bankers and one well-connected congressman, Republican Senator Nelson Aldrich, stealthily collaborated at Jekyll Island to plot the establishment of a shared monopoly, the Federal Reserve System. The bankers represented the interests of J. P. Morgan, Rothschild, Rockefeller, Warburg, and Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company. Consequently, legislation was passed to create the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the culmination of decades of plotting by the international bankers. Under the jurisdiction of a board of directors, the U.S. was divided into twelve Federal Reserve Districts. Americans were led to believe that the Fed would eliminate financial catastrophes and stabilize the economy. In reality, the Fed is a cartel that was designed to obliterate competition and increase profits through higher prices and deceptive policies enforced by the government.</p>
<p>J. P. Morgan arranged the financing and purchasing of American supplies for France and Britain during World War I. By the end of that war, J. P. Morgan Bank had handled $3 billion in commercial transactions, netting $3 million in fees, and had arranged over $1.5 billion in credits to become the world&#8217;s most influential bank, moving it permanently into the political arena of foreign policy, serving as an extension of the federal government. <a name="_ednref6" href="#_edn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In 1901, the U.S. national debt was less than $1 billion. After World War I, the national debt was $25 billion. Between World War I and II, it increased to $49 billion. In 1952, in the midst of the Korean War, under U.N. command, the debt stood at $72 billion. In 1962, the debt was $303 billion which increased to $383 billion by 1970 during the Vietnam War. By 1976, at the end of the Vietnam War, it was $631 billion. During the 1980s and the orchestrated Cold War military buildup, the debt increased substantially. The international bankers funded both the U.S. and the Soviet military buildup. However, all records evidencing congressional acquiescence to the massive banker-funded technological transfer from 1916 forward were classified by Eisenhower&#8217;s executive order in 1953. <a name="_ednref7" href="#_edn7">[7]</a> By 1998, the debt was over $5.5 trillion. Now, the national debt is well over $10.8 trillion. This does not include personal indebtedness such as credit cards, car loans or mortgages.</p>
<p>By the 1920s, banks routinely offered low-interest credit to businesses that had previously relied on profits and patience for expansion. Soon, businesses, eager for additional profit accepted the deceptively low-interest loans offered by the banks. Once hooked, businesses became dependant on banks for growth. To maintain perceptions beneficial to their objectives, bankers have always entrenched like-minded minions into influential positions such as newspaper publishers, editors, columnists, university presidents, professors, textbook writers, labor union leaders, filmmakers, and radio and television commentators.</p>
<p>Even after the deliberate New York Panic of 1920-21, America was still industrially strong. Farms provided adequate and toxin-free, un-genetically modified food. Our infrastructure and transportation systems were then modern and efficient and we were technologically advanced compared to the rest of the world. In 1921, U.S. per capita income was $522. In 1925, Winston Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer, wanting England to return to world leadership, adjusted the British pound to $4.86 which limited the amount of British goods companies and individuals around the world could afford. Consequently, over the next two years, hundreds of millions of dollars of gold flowed to the U.S. from all over Europe. <a name="_ednref8" href="#_edn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Montague Norman of the Bank of England, Charles Rist of the Bank of France, Hjalmer Scacht of the Reichsbank, Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve, all privately-owned central banks, and Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury convened in 1927 and agreed to lower U.S. interest rates and the Fed&#8217;s discount rate. Additionally, in July, 1927, the directors of the Bank of England, the New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the German Reichsbank plotted to move the gold out of the U.S. Allegedly, this helped to generate the depression. By 1928, about $500 million in gold was transferred to Europe, especially Germany, most under the guise of post-war aid.</p>
<p>By 1928, U.S. per capita income grew to $628. Winston Churchill, Benjamin Strong, the New York Federal Reserve chief and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon operated together to ensure that easy money for Wall Street speculation was readily available.</p>
<p>Newspaper and magazine articles promoted stock market speculation claiming that one could make a veritable fortune in a short time for minimum monthly investments. However, there were &#8220;special&#8221; speculators who owned dozens of accounts in various names which could be traded in enormous blocks. Small investors, never in a position to manipulate the market, suffered the consequences and received the blame for the 1929 crash. Blame for every catastrophe is always placed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Since Woodrow Wilson, the Fed has installed and managed many U.S. presidents. On October 25, 1929, President Herbert Hoover claimed: &#8220;The fundamental business of the country is on a sound and prosperous basis.&#8221; The crash of October 28-29, 1929 was devised. On November 8, 2002, current Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said: &#8220;Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You&#8217;re right, we did it. We&#8217;re very sorry. But thanks to you, we won&#8217;t do it again.&#8221; <a name="_ednref9" href="#_edn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>In 1929-1930, the banks, purportedly because they were short on gold, would not give loans to U.S. industry and individuals. Yet, three banks, J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, First National Bank of New York and First National Bank of Chicago, had sufficient money to send huge amounts out of the country to the Bank of International Settlements which ultimately built up Nazi Germany. The money supply was deliberately decreased, causing the Great Depression. People defaulted on their loans and the banks repossessed farms, homes and business properties. People lost their savings &#8211; everything. The banks benefited. It was an unethical, egregious redistribution of assets. The catastrophic crash was world-wide, creating joblessness, hunger, disintegration of production and national bankruptcies.</p>
<p>On March 7, 1930, Hoover said: &#8220;All the evidence indicates that the worst effects of the Crash upon unemployment will have passed during the next sixty days.&#8221; He then signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act against the advice of the thousand economists hired by Wall Street manipulators who were most concerned about repayment of their foreign loans. In September 1930, Bernard Baruch, after returning from a visit to Churchill in England, sent a cable affirming Churchill&#8217;s views about British world supremacy. On December   11, 1930, New York&#8217;s fourth largest bank, Bank of the United States, failed. Its 450,000 depositors had no recourse and no FDIC insurance. Another one thousand banks failed in 1930. <a name="_ednref10" href="#_edn10">[10]</a> Bank failures signal bank consolidation &#8211; extant banks consume them.</p>
<p>The entire national debt in 1932 was $19.5 billion. Roosevelt then initiated the New Deal in 1933 by introducing the practice of deficit spending, which was the brain-child of Britain&#8217;s John Maynard Keynes, a member of the Illuminati. In 1910, Lenin said: &#8220;The surest way to overthrow an established social order is to debauch its currency.&#8221; Nine years later, Keynes wrote: &#8220;Lenin was certainly right, there is no more positive, or subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency &#8230; The process engages all of the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner that not one man in a million is able to diagnose.&#8221; <a name="_ednref11" href="#_edn11">[11]</a></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>On March 9, 1933, Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111, and 6260 which declared that the U.S. was bankrupt. On April 5, 1933, Roosevelt declared a National Emergency and made it illegal for U.S. citizens to own gold. He ordered all gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates to be turned into the Federal Reserve banks by May 1 (the Illuminati was created on May 1, 1776). People would face imprisonment and fines if they refused to relinquish their gold. Further, on June 5, 1933, Congress enacted a joint resolution outlawing all gold clauses in contracts. The Federal Reserve System was not energized until 1933 when the U.S. went off the gold standard which allowed the expansion and devaluation of the money supply. The Federal Reserve collects usury on every bill printed. &#8220;Our currency has no value past the confidence of those who use it.&#8221; <a name="_ednref12" href="#_edn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Gold coinage was withdrawn from circulation, and kept in the form of bullion. The public and the Federal Reserve returned their stocks of gold to the government. The people were paid $20.67 an ounce in Federal Reserve money. The Federal Reserve received Gold Certificates. So the Federal Reserve, owned by some Illuminati families, had control of the country&#8217;s gold and could control its price. The stability and responsibility of the government that issues a currency is the primary reason people accept that currency. Obviously, the collapse of that government would render the currency worthless.</p>

			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> was a world-renowned Serb-American inventor, physicist, mechanical engineer and electrical engineer. He is best known for his revolutionary work in, and numerous contributions to, the discipline of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th century. Tesla&#8217;s patents and theoretical work form the basis of modern alternating current electric power (AC) systems, including the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor, with which he helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution.</p>

			<p> Are we making Holes in Heaven? H.A.A.R.P. (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) is a controversial high frequency radio transmitter, or &#8220;ionospheric heater,&#8221; which is believed to be descended from the works of Dr. Nikola Tesla and is operated by the U.S. Navy/Air Force and Phillip Laboratories in remote Gakona, Alaska.</p>
<p>Using HAARP, our military plans to focus a billion-watt pulsed radio beam into our upper atmosphere, ostensibly for ionospheric research. This procedure will form extremely low frequency waves and send them back to the Earth, enhancing communications with submarines and allowing us to &#8220;see&#8221; into the Earth, detecting anything from oil reserves to underground missile silos.</p>
<p>However, several researchers claim HAARP poses many dangers, including blowing thirty-mile holes in the Earth&#8217;s upper atmosphere. They also warn of possible disruption of the subtle magnetic energies of our Earth and ourselves.</p>
<p>Holes in Heaven? strives to give a fair and accurate appraisal of HAARP, and brings before the public, vital information about a project which could have a dramatic effect upon our entire world.</p>
