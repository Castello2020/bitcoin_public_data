<p>Bumper stickers often reflect the quality of the theology that supports American Christianity.  “God said it and I believe it” used to be popular.  “Are You Saved?” was often seen and a whole variety of challenging, pithy phrases continue to appear: “I Love Jesus”, “Jesus Possess Me”, “Know Jesus, Know Peace”, “Love God Love People”, “One Nation Under God”, “Pray for America”, “Got Jesus”, “Victory In Jesus”, “Honk If You Know Jesus”, “Love God Love People”, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The flippant attitude that pervades American Christianity reflects the feeble impact it has on the culture and the progression of Divine Judgment that overshadows us.</p>
<p>Christians often challenge one another with regular sessions of reading “The Word”; for many Christians this means reading the New Testament with an occasional short selection from the Old.  They believe the Old Testament was applicable to another era and consider this new era one of Grace and any reference to law to be “legalistic”.</p>
<p>It is quickly apparent in reading R. J. Rushdoony that his approach to Christian theology is different than the preaching we hear at our local church.  He believes the entire Bible, every word, is the Word of God   From Genesis to Revelation he ponders each word, phrase, and sentence to determine what action his Creator seeks.  Instead of using his reason as a filter he sets it aside to be used as a guide to the actions God requires.  He wants to obey God rather than understand Him.  He does not pick and choose but glories in the entire Biblical narrative.  He tarries with God’s Law since obedience is the foundational requirement of the Covenant God of the Bible.</p>
<p>He embraces the Charismatic Movement as a new and more vibrant recognition of the Holy Spirit but expresses disdain for tongues and the gibberish that that often results. Sinful men are unable to accurately hear the Holy Spirit without the yardstick of His Law.  We are sinful beings and without the restraint of His written Commandments chaos and wickedness quickly overtake us.  Antinomianism in Charismatic circles destroys the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The power and glory of the God of the Bible must emanate from individual Christian men who live by God’s Commandments.  When men abdicate their responsibility to lead their individual families in obedience to the Will of the Creator they open the door for the state to assume that role and to tighten the vise of tyranny.</p>
<p>When the rule of the Creator is torn from its Biblical base and maligned by sinful human minds the strength of the Gospel no longer beams forth.  Instead we have the amoral, adaptable, pragmatic, competitive, social creatures that are popular today.  Men are suspected of being unfaithful and sexually promiscuous.  Those that stand for honesty, righteousness and faithfulness are often mocked by powerful triflers. </p>
<p>Men no longer understand the leadership position God requires of them.   They are responsible for the safety, well-being and conduct of their family.  They are to be the head of their home and to participate in the government of the community in which they live.</p>
<p>Rushdoony writes, ”A society cannot be vital and possessed of an ongoing vigor if the men therein are marked by a loss of faith, a retreat from responsibility, and an unwillingness to cope with personal problems.  A culture loses its will to live and to conquer if its members manifest a spirit of retreat and surrender.”</p>
<p>Role playing has become a pandemic mendacity.  Public forums are full of men who role-play.  During his campaign President Obama promised scores of actions that were popular and needed.  However, when he assumed the office of President he installed programs diametrical to those he promised.  American politicians never produce what they promise; they are puppets playing roles demanded by an unseen power center.</p>
<p>Congresspersons maintain their office as a grant from the closely held press.  They carefully avoid taking positions that defy politically correct media dictates.  They all play a role and the role is inimical to the well-being of our nation. </p>
<p>Men play an unnatural role in their homes when wives often assume equal or superior authority in family life.  Women were created to helpmates to men and when they assume roles for which they were not intended we lose the decisiveness that is a masculine trait.  Men sin by abdicating their responsibilities and women sin by assuming them.</p>
<p>However, even if role-playing ceased and rational thought began we would still be in serious trouble.  Mortal minds will never produce peace, order, and freedom.</p>
<p>Recently, someone sent me an article by Tom Mullen with the audacious title of “Jesus Christ, Libertarian”.  Mullen quotes verbatim Scripture from John 8 about the woman taken in adultery that Jesus forgave with the admonition to go and sin no more.</p>
<p>Mullin tees off on this particular incident with a plethora of dangerous and erroneous conclusions. He writes: “However, no one has a right to use violence against those who engage in behavior that does not harm another person, regardless of whether or not that behavior violates the laws of God.”  Mullin would have his insignificant opinion override the perfect Law of God.  Such arrogance is the fuel for murder and strife.</p>
<p>Mullin has devised a non-violent system but his system is vulnerable to an opposite system devised by a tyrant who has no aversion to the use of violence to achieve his goals – both systems are products of the anarchic minds of men and sans God’s immutable law one is as valid as the other.  Man was not created to govern himself.  Without the overarching, righteous law of the Creator chaos and strife will continue to plague us.</p>
<p>On page 387 of his “Systematic Theology” Rushdoony lists the curses that are visited on disobedient individuals and nations.  First, fallen man lives under the curse of physical death.  Second, he lives under the fear of “sickness, plagues, and epidemics”.  Third, the advent of drought and natural disasters produces fear.  Fourth, poverty lurks in the economies of profligates.  Fifth, nonbelievers are cursed with war, invasion, defeat, conquest, and ultimate captivity.  Sixth, Frustration annoys the intentions of men and nations when they seek their own will instead of following the Will of the Creator. And seventh, Rushdoony laments the curse of blindness that causes millions of Evangelical Christians to ignore the obvious signs of God’s judgment.</p>
<p>It is the curse of blindness that causes us to ignore the obvious poverty and strife that plagues the world’s pagan nations and the bursting prosperity that marked Christian civilization.  When the United States of America was making an effort to obey God’s Commandments she enjoyed unparalleled prosperity.  We have now become a secular nation and not only poverty but all of the other curses are bursting forth.</p>
<p>We have an adequate supply of anti-war spokespersons in the United States but I have yet to find one who espouses the only viable solution.  History is replete with constant warfare.  Men and nations have been engaged in continuous war from the beginning of time.  The Bible contains that legal structure that God gave us to bring lasting peace but sinful men ignore it.  Paul Craig Roberts is a bright and well informed writer.  He writes with commendable insight into the conduct of our nation but he never once mentions the fact the humanistic solutions to perennial war have never been effective and he fails to consider the legal platform God has given us for lasting peace.   His latest article is <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/07/03/july-4th-militarist-bunkum-encore-request/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
<p>As America continues to fall into the devil’s abbess will Christians finally wake up and begin to heed the One True God?  Mainline churches will not stem the fall.  Patriotism will not reverse it.  Politics and revolution will not save us.  Guns will not help against the judgment of Almighty God.  Our stubborn failure to repent, follow Him, and obey His commandments may seal our fate.</p>
<p>For several years I wrote about the tyrannical nature of our government.  But government is a reflection of the people who are governed and we have voted for the government we are receiving.  We, the people, are the problem.  The prayer that is need it that the One True God would change our hearts bringing a resolute desire for obedience to God and a resulting righteous government. </p>

For example, he asked attendees to consider, </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">“&#8230;.</span><em style="color: #000000;">the derision that comes from being pro-life and pro-traditional marriage (they) threaten us with consequences if we refuse to call what is good, evil, and what is evil, good.

Nor was Adam created by the One God in three Persons as a living soul embodied in flesh, fully person, fully man right from the beginning.   Adam and Eve, if they even existed were emergent products of evolution, their closest relative soulless hominids.  Thus the events described in Genesis are not meant to convey the miraculous creation ex nihilo but the scientific &#8216;reality&#8217; that the universe has an impotent creator that made and ignited a Cosmic Egg (Big Bang) which generated matter and energy. Then after billions of years of God-directed evolution eventuating in the suffering and death of millions of life-forms (God&#8217;s fault, btw) man inexplicably fell from grace even though God is the guilty party, the real cause of death and suffering.  </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">According to this counter-intuitive Gnostic-laced tale of nonsense, evolutionary science, not God&#8217;s Revelation, is a reality in nature explainable by reason and empirical observation and faithful Christians who deny this are in denial of reality.  Faithful Christians who actually affirm the Revelation of God and Special Creation are guilty of defending the backwards, anti-scientific, anti-evolution &#8216;fundamentalist&#8217; interpretation of the book of Genesis thus are not only a cause of embarrassment to fashionably-correct, scientifically enlightened Christians, but are also guilty of harming Christianity. (Creationism Harms Christianity, </span><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsacerdotus.wordpress.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEks37wLI8lYKi75hhiIlU6tXCmUA" target="_blank">sacerdotus.wordpress.com</a><span style="color: #000000;">) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">However, it isn&#8217;t faithful Christians who are ‘embarrassments’ but rather intellectually arrogant evolution-obsessed theologians.  These wolves in sheep clothing mesmerize and persuade susceptible Christian sheep to uncritically accept dangerous esoteric ideas like evolution.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> With respect to Darwin’s theory, Darwin is not its’ inventor. He received the idea from his nature-worshipping pagan grandfather Erasmus Darwin, an important name in European Masonic anti-Christian Church organizations engaged in destructive revolutionary activism. Erasmus mentored his grandson Charles: </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;</span><em style="color: #000000;">Dr. Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) was the first man in England to suggest those ideas which were later to be embodied in the Darwinian theory by his grandson, Charles Darwin (1809-1882) who wrote in 1859 Origin of Species</em><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221; (Scarlet and the Beast, Vol. II, John Daniel, p. 34) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">According to anthropologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, longtime director of the American Museum of Natural History, ancient pagans are the inventers of modern evolutionism. In the introduction to his history of evolutionism Osborn wrote:</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> &#8220;</span><em style="color: #000000;">When I began the search for anticipations of the evolutionary theory&#8230;.I was led back to the Greek natural philosophers and I was astonished to find how many of the pronounced and basic features of the Darwinian theory were anticipated even as far back as the seventh century B.C.&#8221; </em><span style="color: #000000;">(Osborn, From the Greeks to Darwin, p. xi) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">By its’ nature evolutionism belongs to the category of naturalism (all that exists is nature or cosmos), making it antithetical, or in fierce opposition to the infinite Triune God, the supernatural dimension and special creation.  The personal Triune God is outside of His creation&#8212;the natural dimension of space, time, matter and energy&#8212;thus He is not subject to the laws of science: </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;&#8230;.</span><em style="color: #000000;">science has no satisfactory answer to the question of the origin of life on the earth. Perhaps the appearance of life on the earth is a miracle. Scientists are reluctant to accept that view, but their choices are limited: either life was created on the earth by the will of a being outside the grasp of scientific understanding, or it evolved on our planet spontaneously, through chemical reactions occurring in nonliving matter lying on the surface of the planet. The first theory places the question of the origin of life beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. It is a statement of faith in the power of a Supreme Being not subject to the laws of science. The second theory is also an act of faith. The act of faith consists in assuming that the scientific view of the origin of life is correct, without having concrete evidence to support that belief.</em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8221; (Until the Sun Dies, Robert Jastrow, Ph.D. Theoretical Physics, pp. 62-63, 1977) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Only by conceptually murdering the supernatural Triune God and replacing Him with a ‘god’ within the natural dimension (naturalism), thus subject to scientific inquiry, can intellectually arrogant theologians presume to speak for god, claiming that he made and exploded a Cosmic Egg and directs evolutionary transformism together with the rest of their twisted theology dressed in Christian clothing.</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> As an idea evolution is like an onion consisting of multitudinous layers of esoteric meaning.  Darwin&#8217;s theory occupies two or three layers. The many other layers already existed prior to Erasmus going back to the Renaissance and before that to ancient Chaldea and India thence to ancient Greece and Rome where evolution is always and everywhere connected to reincarnation and spiritual evolution (transformism).    </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">On ancient pagan conceptions of reincarnation and spiritual evolution early Church Father Gregory of Nyssa said: </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><em style="color: #000000;">&#8220;[I]f one should search carefully, he will find that their doctrine is of necessity brought down to this.

Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science – the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures and spiritual evolution is the best proof of the divinity of Christ.  (God and the Knowledge of Reality, Thomas Molnar, pp. 78-79) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Father Richard John Neuhaus pulls all of these occult traditions together in his analysis of modern evolutionary scientism as a revitalization of ancient spiritual traditions closely connected to elemental spirits. In his book, “American Babylon,” Neuhaus argues that astrological elemental spirits (powers and principalities) have been recast as, </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;&#8230;</span><em style="color: #000000;">evolutionary dynamics, life forces, or laws of nature.&#8221; Though described as laws rather than spirits, these elemental &#8220;forces&#8221;&#8230;. work their inexorable ways in cold indifference to reason, to will, to love, and to hope. In short, it is suggested that the elemental spirits are in charge and that human freedom is a delusion.&#8221; </em><span style="color: #000000;">(p. 226)</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> Despite that modern evolutionary theologians validate their esoteric projects as empirical or observational science in reality observational science is their enemy.   For instance, evolutionary theology alleges that hominids are supposed to be our ancestors, the so-called transitional life-forms linking modern humans to the common ancestor of all life.    </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">However, the hominid claim has fallen flat on its’ face, said Carl Wieland.

It is the argument that evolution is entirely compatible with the Bible when Genesis, especially the first three chapters, is viewed in its entirety in a non-literal, non-historical context. This is not a heresy unique to modern times. The early Church Fathers dealt with this heresy as well, counting it among the heretical tendencies of apostate Jewish Cabbalists, Origenists and Gnostic pagans such as Simon Magus. </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Fourth-century Fathers such as John Chrysostom, Basil the Great and Ephraim the Syrian, all of whom wrote commentaries on Genesis, specifically warned against treating Genesis as an unhistorical myth or allegory. John Chrysostom strongly warned against paying heed to these heretics, </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">“…</span><em style="color: #000000;">let us stop up our hearing against them, and let us believe the Divine Scripture, and following what is written in it, let us strive to preserve in our souls sound dogmas</em><span style="color: #000000;">.” (Genesis, Creation, and Early Man, Fr. Seraphim Rose, p. 31)</span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> As St. Cyril of Alexandria wrote, higher theological, spiritual meaning is founded upon humble, simple faith in the literal and historic elements of Genesis as Revealed by God and one cannot apprehend rightly the Scriptures without believing in the historical reality of the events and people they describe. (ibid, Seraphim Rose, p. 40) </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">In agreement, Vishal Mangalwadi (1949- ), founder-president of BOMI/Revelation Movement observes that the Revelation of God is the only available foundation for truth, freedom and faith in God&#8217;s gift of reason.  But Western theologians and intellectuals have closed their minds to Revelation, hence Truth, reason and Special Creation.  Because “intelligent” Americans no longer believe in “True Truth” (Francis Schaeffer) they invent stories and use empty god words as substitutes for the infinite, personal Triune God.  Thus Gospel Truth is now &#8216;Gospel Story&#8217; and history a series of unfolding stories such as the physical science story (Big Bang) which may or may not include the use of a god-word; the biological science story (evolutionary transformism), the climate science story (global warming or change), and the social science story (gay marriage): </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">“</span><em style="color: #000000;">Doing science” increasingly means peddling politically correct dogma – that is, stories that have evolved into myths. No one really knows if there was only one Big Bang or other bigger bangs as well; whether we live in a universe or multi-verse; whether life evolved on this planet or came from outer space . . . but if you want a tenured position in a university, and if you want your research projects funded, you have to toe politically correct storyline – champion dogma</em><span style="color: #000000;">.&#8221;  (How Did the West&#8217;s &#8216;Rational Animal&#8217; Become Incapable of Using Reason?

Their subsequent fall was traced by Richard Weaver in his book, &#8220;</span><em style="color: #000000;">Ideas Have Consequences</em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8221; (1945). </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Weaver writes that 14th century Western man had made an &#8220;</span><em style="color: #000000;">evil decision</em><span style="color: #000000;">&#8221; to abandon his belief in the transcendent Triune God, His Revelation and unchanging universals, thus the position that &#8220;</span><em style="color: #000000;">there is a source of truth higher than and independent of man&#8230;&#8221;</em><span style="color: #000000;"> The consequence of this ‘evil decision’ is a still unfolding catastrophe reaching fullness in our own time: </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;</span><em style="color: #000000;">The denial of everything transcending experience means inevitably&#8230;the denial of truth.

<p>During an interview with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fcarrie-underwood-us-country-queen-speaks-out-for-gay-marriage--but-how-will-conservative-fans-take-it-7831956.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPzt3YNsP0nrhK2pSQPixzQgPo5w">The Independent</a> last year, country western star Carrie Underwood, a professing Christian, got the media’s full attention when she decided to come out in support of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Flove-homosexual-marriage&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGV4fKwh54esALkOup0RVww9jYIg">gay “marriage</a>.”  “As a married person myself,” she chirped, “I don’t know what it’s like to be told I can’t marry somebody I love, and want to marry.  I can’t imagine how that must feel. I definitely think we should all have the right to love, and love publicly, the people that we want to love.”  Underwood also noted that she attends a gay-friendly church.</p>
<p>Four years ago another popular “Christian” singer, Jennifer Knapp, came out as a lesbian.  In an interview Knapp stated that she wasn’t interested in becoming another spokesperson for the gay agenda because she wasn’t equipped for that.  “I’m in no way capable of leading a charge for some kind of activist movement,” she bluntly <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2Fct%2F2010%2Faprilweb-only%2Fjenniferknapp-apr10.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8Y55eqsLFG-jDeGYeMBGjByF1FQ">told “Christianity Today”</a> in 2010, adding, “I’m not capable of getting into the theological argument as to whether or not we should or shouldn’t allow homosexuals within our church.” (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fjonathanmerritt.religionnews.com%2F2014%2F05%2F21%2Fjennifer-knapp-writes-book-faith-sexuality-fall-grace%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2WvCBUn_oTeeZBdiOehbfYgMrLQ">Source</a>)  Four years later we learn that Jennifer has boned up on theology 101 and now feels she’s capable of arguing her view on what the Bible teaches on homosexuality.  Purchase her soon to be released book where she tells the story of her troubled life and you’ll discover Jennifer’s liberal theology.   And, not surprisingly, on her book publisher’s website we learn that she has become an “advocate for LGBT issues in the church.”</p>
<p>The gay agenda has weaseled its way into all aspects of society, including religious institutions, corporations, politics, the media, education, the arts, the entertainment industry and so on.  As a result, there’s a great divide in this country.  Even though the Bible clearly opposes homosexuality, a growing number of professing Christians have no problem with it. Far be it from a Christian to hurt someone’s feelings or to be thought of as – <em>gasp</em> – homophobic.  Anyone who dares oppose sodomy is said to be intolerant, even bigoted.  Well, the fact of the matter is that society has been indoctrinated to believe that homosexuality is normal and natural despite the fact that the scriptures teach just the opposite.  Not only is sodomy deemed unnatural, the Apostle Paul uses the term <em>unseemly</em>:</p>
<p><em>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fromans%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAFEYj3q3W281ixj49e8hJhs1Dvw">Rom 1:26-27</a>)</p>
<p>With all the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmbarber%2F140414&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwHe97w81w7C-_6FdNjtmC5YxMlg">health risks involved in homosexual behavior</a> why are Christians expected to be tolerant instead of outraged?</p>
<p>The vast majority of highly respected, published, biblical scholars agree that Scripture clearly teaches that homosexuality is <em>sin</em>.  Therefore practicing same-sex sex is unacceptable to God…to Jesus…to the Holy Spirit…in other words, to the holy <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fwhat-trinity&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEo-YUfNhiE1JzxG8URFbKyssVkVw">Trinity</a>.</p>
<p>Pastor Larry Tomczak said of so-called Christian entertainers who seem more concerned about their careers than with what the Bible teaches, “To say we genuinely care about our fellow man, yet not “speak the truth in love” is cowardice.”</p>
<p>Amy Grant and Dan Haseltine are the most recent Christian entertainers to take a stance on gay “marriage.” They’re for it.  Thus, Amy and Dan are cowards.</p>
<p>Amy Grant is a singer-songwriter, musician, author and actor.  This accomplished woman also has dozens of Dove awards, six Grammys and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Dan is the lead singer of popular Christian singing group Jars of Clay and “tweeter” extraordinaire.</p>
<p>Recently Grant agreed to do an interview with the gay press.  According to Chris Azzopardi:</p>
<p><em>During her first gay press interview, and for an entire hour, the Grammy winner reflected &#8211; with her usual sincerity and thoughtfulness &#8211; on her loyal gay fan base, how she reconciles Christianity and homosexuality, her &#8220;compassion&#8221; for gay marriage…</em></p>
<p>Azzopardi was curious to know if she was invited to perform at the wedding of one of her gay fans and couldn’t do it because of a conflict in her schedule.  She replied:</p>
<p><em>I was invited. I was honored to be invited. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pridesource.com%2Farticle.html%3Farticle%3D59691&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvWwp6SKmIPCzBzHpYiqvIfQ6yFw">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Honored?  Why would Amy, who proclaims her love for Jesus, feel that it’s an honor to be invited to sing Christian music at a gay “marriage” ceremony?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious. She has rejected <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fdictionary-sola-scriptura&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjRxef_eEQRPyM0EUTF7wuce7MCw">Sola Scriptura</a> in favor of following her <em>feelings</em>.  As I already pointed out, homosexuality is diametrically opposed to Scripture.</p>
<p>Equally concerning is Grant’s 2010 interview with the world&#8217;s largest Catholic network, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catholic.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGl6wnTwwhx5X9LcYtzQuXeM2XGg">Catholic Online</a>.  Has she not heard of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.carm.org%2Fvbb%2Fshowthread.php%3F165901-What-was-the-Protestant-Reformation&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHft-FywcbBBpjwRhi7aMrym5C3Uw">Protestant Reformation</a>?  By doing the interview she as much as endorsed a religious system that has led billions of people down a path that ends at the Gates of Hell.</p>
<p>Reformer Martin Luther made it clear what Protestants must believe about the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.the-highway.com%2FHorton_cath.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGD0HD9JfITPhvzPPM3RXBt4_QvCA">Roman Catholic Church</a>:</p>
<p><em>What kind of a church is the pope’s church?” asked Martin Luther.  “It is an uncertain, vacillating and tottering church. Indeed, it is a deceitful, lying church, doubting and unbelieving, without God’s Word. For the pope with his wrong keys teaches his church to doubt and to be uncertain.</em></p>
<p><em>If it is a vacillating church, then it is not the church of faith, for the latter is founded upon a rock, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it (Matthew.16:18). If it is not the church of faith, then it is not the Christian church, but it must be an unchristian, anti-Christian, and faithless church which destroys and ruins the real, holy, Christian church.<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fapprising.org%2F2014%2F06%2F09%2Fjoel-osteen-meets-pope-francis-with-a-prominent-mormon%2F%23footnote_2_92935&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbjmzhTqOEv3yBbRApes3--SNhkQ">3</a></em> (H/T <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fapprising.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXVztZsSfe6SLhXWgiAGKsPzmVig">Ken Silva</a>)</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t require a degree in theology to know that the RCC has for centuries been spreading a false gospel, a gospel that does not save and intends to keep men blinded from the truth.  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F4.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwOXs7PJ2qdtpvsbf83kRuHO8Zrw">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). That Ms Grant—or any other professing Christian&#8211;would agree to sit down with a representative of a false religious system shows how little discernment she has.  Sadly, it appears that she is not concerned that her fans understand authentic Christian doctrine that will help them mature and grow in their faith.  Amy must know that,</p>
<p><em>There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death. </em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fproverbs%2F16.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRaHMYVJgt14KZCgRNoOAdqAzTvA">Proverbs 16:25</a>)</p>
<p>Likewise:</p>
<p><em>Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.”</em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fjohn%2F14.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9gtp_oS3Y7YuzI4R3H3ZiieaJOA">John 14:21</a>)</p>
<p>Dan Haseltine is not a household name.   But many believers are familiar with the popular Christian band <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jarsofclay.com%2Fhome%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFv3TJXaXFLiy2gGT-6KJSj2ge_6Q">Jars of Clay</a>.  In April Dan <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewire.com%2Fpolitics%2F2014%2F04%2Fjars-of-clays-christian-fans-lash-out-after-the-lead-singer-tweets-for-same-sex-marriage%2F361256%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEw_vzMnriq2plMMOPDAjTHmhvCgQ">tweeted</a> his support for gay “marriage” and claimed that Scripture has nothing to say on morality.  When Christians objected to his unbiblical stance, he tweeted this stunning rebuke:</p>
<p><em>I don’t particularly care about Scriptures stance on what is “wrong” I care more about how it says we should treat people.</em></p>
<p>On biblical morality he tweeted:</p>
<p><em>Because most people read and interpret scripture wrong. I don’t think scripture “clearly” states much about morality.</em></p>
<p>The following day Metro Weekly reported Haseltine’s response to the uproar:</p>
<p><em>“Not meaning to stir things up BUT… is there a non-speculative or non ‘slippery slope’ reason why gays shouldn’t marry? I don’t hear one.” He went on to write “I’m trying to make sense of the conservative argument. But it doesn’t hold up to basic scrutiny. Feels akin to women’s suffrage. I just don’t see a negative effect to allowing gay marriage. No societal breakdown, no war on traditional marriage. ?? Anyone?”</em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstandupforthetruth.com%2F2014%2F04%2Fjars-clay-lead-says-christian-upbringing-im-way-now%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFq9TMubusYNFZtLNgKNSJhlsokDQ">Source</a>)</p>
<p>By not taking a strong stance against gay “marriage” Amy and Dan have surrendered to three enemies: the world, the flesh and the devil.  And let’s be clear.  From their “progressive” vantage point, their brothers and sisters in Christ who <em>oppose</em> same-sex “marriage” (for biblical reasons) are homophobes, hate mongers and bigots.</p>
<p>But this is not only about Christian entertainers that have gone the way of progressive Christianity.  It is equally about the so-called Bible believing Christian who has chosen to ignore what God’s Word says on homosexuality; the one who puts his tail between his legs and cowers rather than to stand up for the Truth.  God’s people are commanded to “contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.”  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fjude%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFv2admg3xSGGQiX4JEvYy5vysVKA">Jude 1:3</a>)  And by the way, the discerning Christian knows perfectly well that same-sex sex is prohibited in Scripture.  Moreover, a spiritual person (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_corinthians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAN_P3vy8vtdSA9BMuv1JJ0IsZeQ">1 Cor. 2:15</a>) will understand that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fsin-against-God.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDvScnU7MuNVRpRAY1Z30zDywIYw">every sin is ultimately a sin against God</a>.  “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fromans%2F3.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_CnGI_BTTBvw8mogbBPKaZrpkTw">Romans 3:23</a>)</p>
<p>I’ll end this with a lengthy quote from Walter Martin, apologist and founder of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fequip.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGvniCUqaxa2FMfoS-yiASSqHrXA">Christian Research Institute</a>.  Over two decades ago Dr. Martin gave us fair warning:</p>
<p><em>I don’t think it needs blackboard diagram; or any amount of sophisticated logical presentation a fortiori. I think you can be a fifth-grader and understand that if God says “cursed” is something He takes an extremely dim view of it. I think that’s a rational approach. So the homosexual theologians who are attempting today to defend homosexuality on the basis of Biblical theology are in the same position as the Sadducees, to whom Jesus addressed this remark: “You do err. Not knowing the Scriptures or the power of God.”</em></p>
<p><em>That’s exactly where they are. They are trying to put Christianity and homosexuality in the same bed; and you’re not gonna do it because Jesus Christ very forcibly condemned it. And you say, “Where in the New Testament did Jesus ever mention homosexuality?” Open your Bibles and find out; because contrary to what the gay church says, He not only spoke against it—He went out of His way to make it very clear [so] nobody’d misunderstand Him.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, you do have to study your Greek New Testament to come up with it. Most homosexual theologians, so-called, that I have talked to don’t even know the Greek alphabet, much less their Greek exegesis so they miss it completely—but it’s here in the passage and it should be looked at. Matthew, chapter 15, Christ is speaking, verse 19, “For out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts, murders,” notice the differentiation, “adulteries, fornications,” plural, “thefts, false witness, blasphemies.”</em></p>
<p><em>“These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.” “The word homosexual is not there; what are you arguing about?” I’m arguing about the use of the word porneus, which was found written over the wall, and the doorway, and the arches, in excavations [by] archaeologists of Roman brothels. And the word porneus did not mean “sex before marriage” alone.</em></p>
<p><em>It meant homosexuality, bestiality, and all forms of degraded sex. And it became well known to everybody in the culture, if any of them ever did their homework, that porneus referred to anything goes. Jesus well knew the Roman brothels. He well knew the culture of His time; and when He said adulteries and fornications—plural—He was making a direct reference to the practices of the Romans and the Greeks and the pagans of the time who prostituted themselves to all forms of evil.</em></p>
<p><em>He knew it; He condemned it. It’s not just the matter of the word, it’s a matter of the culture; and Jesus certainly understood the culture of His time—if He didn’t, nobody did. And therefore, when He used the word fornications, He obviously was making reference to all forms—all forms, inclusive forms—of that which was the deviation from the norm of Jewish law.</em></p>
<p><em>And the reason I can say that with such dogmatism is because He was a rabbi. And if a rabbi didn’t know Jewish law on the subject of homosexuality, nobody on earth knew it. …</em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fapprising.org%2F2011%2F03%2F21%2Fjesus-does-condemn-homosexuality%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkEnaOmCzok9xx7FYoEnmM-j0eHA">Source</a>)</p>

<p>After two mystical encounters with the evil spirit Zarathustra, the dark prophet Nietzsche announced the &#8220;<em>death of the Christian God.&#8221;</em> Dubbing himself the Antichrist, Nietzsche proclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The greatest recent event — that &#8216;God is dead,&#8217; that the belief in the Christian God has ceased to be believable — is even now beginning to cast its first shadows over Europe; however, few really understood &#8221; what has really happened here, &#8220;and what must collapse now that this belief has been undermined — all that was built upon it, leaned on it, grew into it; for example, our whole European morality</em>.&#8221; (False Dawn, Lee Penn, p. 433)</p>
<p>From the beginning of Christ’s earthly ministry, there were those who received Him but many more, like Nietzsche, who would not, and so it will be until the end.   The former are those who admit and humbly confess their sinful condition while the latter, being full of stubborn pride, covetousness, and envy will not.</p>
<p>Not even the mighty miracle of creation ex nihilo as described in John’s Gospel and Christ’s own bodily resurrection (Luke 16:31) can persuade those who choose not to believe.</p>
<p>This willful unbelief in Christ had been prophesied long before.  In support of this John cites Isaiah 53:1-3,</p>
<p>“<em>He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem</em>.”</p>
<p>In order to be received, one must be acceptable.  Christ is rejected by proud, rebellious, sinless men along with His offer of salvation because He is not acceptable to them.  Thus their final word to Him is the cross.</p>
<p>At the root of the rejection of Jesus Christ God incarnate is the rebellious assertion that man has not been created by Him.  He is a free spirit neither dependent upon Him for his life nor created in His spiritual image but rather a conscious product of evolution.  He is a man-god who can choose either to murder God or to invent sock-puppet deities to do his bidding, for he is the master of science, evolution, matter, energy, time, and being who through his own knowledge and powers will save himself, or so he foolishly believes.  In reality, an inner blinding prevents him from ‘<em>seeing</em>’ that his liberty does not lead to greater freedom but to slavery because willful rejection of his Creator means he becomes Satan’s infernal tool.</p>
<p>“<strong>I am become a monstrous machine of annihilation</strong>…”  Ritual of Destruction, the Satanic Bible, Anton LeVey</p>
<p>The ritual ‘murder’ of the Christian God led to the collapse of far more than just European morality.  Consider the following:</p>
<p>In Christian thought, a person is a spirit and personality is the total individuality of the spirit. Without spirit there is no person.  The term &#8216;person&#8217; originated in Christian theologies developmental struggle to comprehend the nature and experience of the Christian God, the transcendent, personal Triune God:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The derivative concept of human personhood is a gift of the Christian faith to culture</em>…” (Stephen P. Stratton, Chapter 14, p. 247, The Self, Paul Vitz &amp; Susan M. Felch, Editors)</p>
<p>Whether the Founders were individually Christian or not, there was among them a strong Christian consensus that finds some of its greatest spiritual and moral expression in the scholarly works of Samuel Rutherford in “Lex Rex” (1644) and in the writings of the 18th century jurist William Blackstone.</p>
<p>Rutherford reasoned that since all people are sinners, then no sinner&#8212;whether President, Att. General, Senator, ‘gay,’ pastor, cop, jurist, perverse sex-educator, abortionist, evolutionary biologist, or Supreme Court Justice for example&#8212;is superior to any other sinner. No sinner is above the law but rather subject to the law without exception.  All must recognize that they are sinners under the unchanging transcendent Law of God.</p>
<p>Blackstone greatly influenced early American understanding of the Christian God, the Bible, Law and nature. He taught that since the eternally unchanging Triune God is the omnipotent Creator who works and governs the affairs of men then all law should be consistent with His Revelation in the Bible. No law should be passed that is contrary to the higher law of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as all men are created spiritual equals in the eyes of God, then life, property, worth, dignity and other unalienable rights are conferred upon each human person at conception.   For example, the unalienable right to life is because all people are God’s spiritual image bearers while freedom of religion and speech are the temporal property of a person’s God-given spiritual property of conscience and reason.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Property</em>,&#8221; published in The National Gazette on March 29, 1792, James Madison outlines the meaning of a person’s God-given spiritual property, some of its’ temporal rights and the meaning and intent of just government as opposed to unjust government:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>He has a property&#8230;.in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them.&#8221;  &#8220;He has a property&#8230;in his opinions and the free communication of them.&#8221;  &#8220;He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them.&#8221; &#8220;He has property very dear to him in the safety and liberty of his person.&#8221;</em>  (The Heritage Foundation)</p>
<p>Property is,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.<em>a man&#8217;s land, or merchandize, or money</em> (and) <em>as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights. Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties or his possessions.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Just government is instituted to protect property of every sort:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>This being the end of government, that alone is a just government, which impartially secures to every man, whatever is his own</em>.&#8221; (Samuel Rutherford, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flexrex.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO1sCexTm3r93UBFOA6aF4uQ1WIA">lexrex.com</a>)</p>
<p>The Constitution therefore, recognizes the divine nature of man&#8217;s creation, that man is a person endowed by his personal Creator with spiritual property, a divine right to life and liberty, and the means of acquiring and possessing property. Hence our Republic recognizes Law is unchangeable because the Creator (John 1:1) is the unchanging Lawgiver Who is the same today as yesterday and for all eternity:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>It is sufficiently obvious, that persons and property are the two great subjects on which Governments are to act; and that the rights of persons, and the rights of property, are the objects, for the protection of which Government was instituted. These rights cannot well be separated</em>.&#8221; (James Madison, Speech at the Virginia Convention, December 2, 1829)</p>
<p>Vishal Mangalwadi, India&#8217;s foremost Christian scholar affirms that the Christian gift of personhood gave birth to the &#8220;<em>belief in the unique dignity of human beings,&#8221; </em>and this is,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>the force that created Western civilization, where citizens do not exist for the state but the state exists for the individuals. Even kings, presidents, prime ministers, and army generals cannot be allowed to trample upon an individual and his or her rights</em>.&#8221; (Truth and Transformation: A Manifesto for Ailing Nations, pp. 12-13)</p>
<p><strong> Death of the Christian God: Catastrophic Consequences</strong></p>
<p><strong>“</strong><em>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.”</em> John 3:19</p>
<p>Once the citadel of the Light that came into the world, modern Western Europe and America are roiling seas of darkness punctuated here and there by shrinking islands of light because evil-minded men love darkness rather than Light. Thus the perversely twisted, upside-down, lawless atmosphere of our age is the &#8220;<em>death of the Christian God&#8221; </em>made tangible.</p>
<p>When people fall away from the knowledge of God and transgress against His commandments, these actions effectively turn them back to their natural state. This means that in forsaking God, the fount of living waters, they have become cracked cisterns that hold no water. (Jer. 2:13) In other words, the death of the Christian God logically means the death of spirit (person), hence also spiritual and temporal property, and by extension the collapse of Western civilization and America’s Constitutional Republic&#8212; “<em>if the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?”</em>  Psalm 11:3<br />
The methodology of the ‘murder’ of Christ the Creator (John 1:1) requires that the miracle of six day creation (Genesis account) together with Adam and Eve and their fall be de-historicized and reduced to myth and fable (annihilated), a project already underway by the time of Descartes and fulfilled with infernal ‘higher criticism.’</p>
<p>In her book &#8220;<em>Total Truth</em>,&#8221; Nancy Pearcy, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, writes that one of the great ironies of history is that the enduring impact of Descartes philosophy has been precisely the opposite of what he had intended. Descartes had intended the defense of the human soul/spirit over and against the dehumanizing mechanistic and materialistic conception of the universe. Instead, soul/spirit was reduced to a shadowy substance totally irrelevant to the material realm known by natural science. The immortal soul/spirit became a kind of ghost only tenuously connected to the physical body.</p>
<p>After the success of Newtonian physics natural science began to take on the trappings of religion. Epistemologically, science began to be viewed as the way to true understanding, and by extension, true progress. Nature itself took on the guise of an impersonal, mystical entity described as a cosmic machine governed by deterministic energies working through natural laws as strictly as the gears of a clock. Though soul/ spirit are crucial for reason, conscience, morality, belief, faith, prayer, theorizing, science, math and religion, there was no room for them in the cosmic machine.</p>
<p>The mechanistic conception gave rise to evil ‘isms’&#8211;rationalism, positivism, skepticism, relativism, and scientific materialism (atheism), which granted the sovereign reason of sinful man and naturalistic science an epistemological monopoly on so-called &#8220;real&#8221; knowledge, facts and truth while trivializing everything else to faith, personal belief and social constructs.  The devilish consequences of this have been horrendous, for whereas the creation of universal moral law was traditionally the function of the Triune God, now this function is arrogated to the individual human will, making the &#8220;reason&#8221; of sinners into God and science into a dictatorship of the knowable.</p>
<p>“…<strong>men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil</strong>.” John 3:19</p>
<p>With &#8220;reason&#8221; sitting on the throne of the Christian God, heaven was shut-down and the physical world of the senses elevated to the supreme reality. The six day Genesis account was de-historicized and replaced with imaginative evolutionary cosmologies claiming vast ages of time.  As supernatural Christian theism declined, immutable truth, moral law and sin disappeared under the onslaught of evil “isms” and apostate Protestant Liberalism (pantheism) in tandem with reductionist evolutionary biology, which became the most prestigious way to study the depersonalized human organism. With knowledge limited to the sensory realm, Jesus Christ the Word Incarnate was “murdered,” meaning reduced by evil men to an immanent mystical evolutionary force (Christ consciousness) while man’s soul/spirit was lost in an endless cycle of reductionism and determinism. Man, the person created in the spiritual likeness of the One God in three Persons would be lost.  In his place would stand the subhuman hominid, a conscious product of evolution, the god of forces.</p>
<p>Today, the ‘god’ evolution has so thoroughly replaced the living Word (John 1:1) and Special Creation in the consciousness of vast numbers of scientifically endarkened men and women within and without the whole body of the Christian Church that one of the leading evolution-worshippers of our day, Professor S.J. Gould, describes scientism and evolution as the story of mankind that tells us,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>where we came from, how we got here, and perhaps where we are going. Quite simply, it is science’s version of Roots, except it is the story of us all</em>.”   (The Religious Nature of Evolution Theory and its Attack on Christianity, John G. Leslie and Charles K. Pallaghy, Ph.D, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>)</p>
<p>In glowing affirmation, Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) , a prominent evolutionary biologist and progressive creationist sees the ‘god’ evolution as a light that illuminates all facts, a trajectory which all lines of thought must follow, for if man,</p>
<p>“&#8230;<em>has arrived at his present state as a result of natural processes rather than a supernatural will, he can learn to control these processes…The concept of evolution, which is now basic to the life sciences, has provided new and in some ways revolutionary answers to questions men have been asking for centuries. The two most important of these are, ‘Why am I here, what is the purpose of human existence, and what is the nature of the world of life that surrounds us?”   </em>(Dobzhansky, T., Ayala, F.J., Stebbins, G.L. and Valentine, J.W., Evolution, W.H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, 1977)</p>
<p><strong>Triumph of Scientism and the ‘god’ Evolution</strong></p>
<p>At its founding and for about 150 years after America was the world’s beacon of freedom and hope because it was founded on the true Light of unchanging truths such as,</p>
<p>“<em>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8211;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. .</em> .”</p>
<p>Now however, an endarkened generation of law makers, politicians, entertainers, professors, seminarians and high school graduates no longer believe that anyone knows ‘the’ truth or even if whether males are meant to be males or females too. For them, anyone who claims to know the truth is a bigoted fundamentalist because they know there was never a fall from God’s good creation but rather an evolutionary ascent moving from primordial matter to creeping things, crawling things, knuckle-dragging things to man. They know with certainty that human beings were never created but evolved. And as the ‘god’ evolution endows nothing&#8212;not soul/spirit, personhood, unalienable rights and the freedom to exercise them&#8212;then our Constitution is as meaningless as Xmas and Special Creation.</p>
<p>The real source of this evil and madness is a godless left-right confederacy of nihilists described by Professor Angelo Codevilla as America’s Ruling Class.  In “<em>The Ruling Class: How They Corrupted America and What We Can Do About It,”  </em>Codevilla, emeritus professor of international relations at Boston University, argues that America’s real war is between Americans who still worship the supernatural Triune God and a class of evolutionary humanists who dominate both political parties, academe, Hollywood, science and media.  They preach from pulpits, run big business, our economy and the country&#8217;s major institutions and imagine themselves entitled to reshape an America that they regard as composed of un-evolved subhuman hominids.</p>
<p>The Ruling Class affirm that scientism and evolution trump the Revelation of God, and as they are the evolved products of the &#8216;god&#8217; evolution they are science’s authoritative enlightened priests and god-men who pray to themselves,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; <em>as saviors of the planet and as shapers of mankind in their own image</em>..&#8221; (The Ruling Class: How They Corrupted America and What We Can Do About It, p. xix)<br />
After more than eighty years of nearly unopposed evolutionary evangelization in the schools, media, seminaries, academia and elsewhere the Ruling Class is finally at liberty to declare that evolution is “mind,”</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>….enlarging its domain up the chain of species.&#8221;  </em>The god evolution is the <em>“universe&#8230;a mind that oversees, orchestrates, and gives order and structure to all things</em>.&#8221;   (Algeny, Jeremy Rifkin, 1983, p. 188)</p>
<p>Now that scientism and evolution reign supreme, Satan’s infernal machines, such as the demonized Rifkin,  no longer feel like guests,</p>
<p>”&#8230;..<em> in someone else&#8217;s home and therefore obliged to make our behavior conform with a set of pre-existing cosmic rules. It is our creation now. We make the rules. We establish the parameters of reality. We create the world, and because we do, we no longer feel beholden to outside forces. We no longer have to justify our behavior, for we are now the architects of the universe. We are responsible to nothing outside ourselves for we are the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever</em>.” (ibid)</p>
<p>According to Robert Muller, the father of World Core Curriculum, now that evolution is “mind” highly evolved men are free to spiritually evolve into higher and higher forms, to become one with the ‘divine:’</p>
<p>“<em>Once again, but this time on a universal scale, humankind is seeking no less than its reunion with the ‘divine,’ its transcendence into ever higher forms of life.  Hindus call our earth Brahma, or God, for they rightly see no difference between our earth and the divine.  This ancient simple truth is slowly dawning again upon humanity.  Its full flowering will be the real, great new story of humanity as we are about to enter our cosmic age&#8230;” </em>(New Genesis: Shaping a Global Spirituality, Robert Muller, father of Core Curriculum, 1984, p. 84)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..<strong>the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one.&#8221;  </strong>1 John 5:19<strong>    &#8220;Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.&#8221;</strong>  Luke 11:35</p>
<p>From the post-flood world of ancient Babylon to our own, the majority of the world&#8217;s people have lived under the tyranny of powers, principalities and various determinisms&#8212;karma, reincarnation, evolution, fates, furies, chance, cause, doom, natural selection, and genes. They believed that all events in the real world were predestined and controlled by unseen forces of the cosmos that the apostle Paul described as the elemental spirits of the universe.</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ God incarnate demonstrated His absolute control over the elements (Luke 8:24) the tyranny of determinism was cast down and utterly broken.  In the fourth century Gregory of Nazianzen suggested that at the very moment when the Magi came to worship the child of Mary and Joseph, it was then that the tyranny of determinism was broken:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;From that moment onward, the cosmos has orbited around the newborn king&#8230;Christ is the logos&#8212;the word and the reason by whom all exists and to whom all is ordered</em>.&#8221; (American Babylon, Neuhaus, p. 226)<br />
Determinism crept into the West when evil spirits entered into the heart of Christendom during the Renaissance.   They came quietly, first to certain theologians who rejected Jesus Christ in favor of Hermetic magic, Babylonian Kabala, Eastern mysticism, reincarnation, evolution, karma and other occult traditions and determinisms, and then openly with the brazen claim that laws of matter and evolution ultimately govern the world and man.</p>
<p>With penetrating insight, Father Richard John Neuhaus connects modern evolutionary scientism to its&#8217; ancient spiritual foundations in astrology. In his book, &#8220;<em>American Babylon</em>,&#8221; Neuhaus argues that astrological elemental spirits have been recast as,</p>
<p>&#8220;…<em>evolutionary dynamics, life forces, or laws of nature.&#8221;  Though described as laws rather than spirits, these elemental &#8220;forces”…. work their inexorable ways in cold indifference to reason, to will, to love, and to hope. In short, it is suggested that the elemental spirits are in charge and that human freedom is a delusion.</em>&#8220;(p. 226)</p>
<p>“<strong>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.”</strong>  Colossians 2:8</p>
<p>According to Pastor Larry DeBruyn, the word &#8220;<em>rudiments&#8221;</em> (Greek, stoicheion) relates to the universe of matter and energy and is variously,</p>
<p><em>“…. translated “elemental powers” (NAB), “elementary principles” (NASB), “basic principles” (NIV, NKJV), “evil powers” (NLT), and “elemental spirits” (ESV, NRSV). Translations indicate that stoicheion’s meaning diverges between “principles” and “powers,” between the “physical elements” constitutive of the cosmos or universe, or the “spiritual powers” that inhabit it. In 2 Peter 3:10, the first sense—that is, the “elements” which “shall melt with fervent heat”—is evident, while in Galatians 4:3 and 9, the other sense—that is, “world forces” which once “held in bondage” the Galatian believers—is evident.&#8221;</em> (The Supreme Supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ,<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fguardinghisflock.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJMBqN8eF8dZg-IRvA0zfKH7BGHw">guardinghisflock.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The Worldview of Evil Spirits</strong></p>
<p>“….<em>we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”</em>  Eph. 6:12</p>
<p>During the 1970s Satanism and possession became front page news in America.  It was during this time that the eminent theologian Malachi Martin, a former Jesuit professor at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome published his shattering book on demon oppression and possession.<br />
Martin&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Hostage to the Devil</em>: <em>the Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans</em>,&#8221; presents five cases of actual possession that express important aspects of the worldview of evil spirits which allow us to not only identify these elements but discern their devastating effects within the whole body of the Christian church, the minds of millions of Americans and by extension, our nation.</p>
<p>The worldview of evil powers always takes the form of nature worship, or celebration of created things such as matter and energy as opposed to worship of the living, personal Creator Who created everything. Thus in support of the idea that living beings created themselves it is virulently anti-supernatural and Genesis account creation ex nihilo in favor of one dimensional naturalism and evolutionary cosmologies.</p>
<p>In one case, an evil spirit’s evolutionary cosmology teaching the self-created &#8220;universe of matter&#8221; and human life was disclosed wherein,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>men, women, animals, plants, cities, oceans </em>(are) <em>interconnected.  There is really no difference between one thing and anything else&#8230;.land, ocean, animals, humans, plants are one living organism clad in the shell of breathable atmosphere.  Psychic forces bind it all together&#8230;.It is a self-creating, self-protecting, self-developing thing&#8230;..Earth as mother, as womb, as god, as tomb, as a whole unity protected by its own shell and its own strength (is) all there is.&#8221; </em>(p. 395)</p>
<p>From the Big Bang (exploding cosmic egg) which supposedly created matter and energy in the demon&#8217;s description of the universe as &#8220;self-creating&#8221; to inflationary in the description of the universe as a &#8220;self-developing thing&#8221; to Gaia as &#8220;Earth as self-protecting mother&#8221; the possessing demon’s evolutionary cosmology is very similar to occult New Age spirituality.</p>
<p>Another important case involved David, a Catholic priest who became obsessed with the evolutionary scientism of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.  Teilhard’s destructive influence is widespread today within transnational Trans-humanist circles, the U.N., the Catholic Church, and increasingly within the Protestant Church.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Teilhard de Chardin: Trojan Horse of Vatican II/Heretic Extraordinaire</em>,&#8221; Dr. J. P. Hubert wonders whether based on Teilhard’s admission of a mystical encounter if his evolutionary science was satanically inspired.  Teilhard describes his strange encounter:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The man was walking in the desert&#8230;when the Thing swooped down on him.  Then, suddenly, a breath of scorching air passed across his forehead, broke through the barrier of his closed eyelids; an irresistible rapture took possession of him&#8230;.mightily refashioning the enfeebled fibres of his being.  And at the same time the anguish of some superhuman peril oppressed him, a confused feeling that the force which had swept down upon him was equivocal, turbid, the combined essence of all evil and goodness.  You called me: here I am grown weary of abstractions, of attenuations, of the wordiness of social life, you wanted to pit yourself against Reality entire and untamed.  I was waiting for you in order to be made holy.  And now I am established on you for life, or for death&#8230;.He who has once seen me can never forget me: he must either damn himself with me or save me with himself.  O you who are divine and mighty, what is your name? Speak</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hubert concludes that Teilhardism is,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;no doubt of Satanic origin&#8212;a true &#8220;religion of man,&#8221; if ever there was one</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>America’s Unfolding Spiritual Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>For over eighty-five years, America has been incrementally conquered by the same madness-inducing demon of hatred and violence that earlier took over Russia, China, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>This demon is mainly embodied within America&#8217;s &#8220;scientifically endarkened&#8221; Ruling Class which is deeply oppressed and possessed by elemental spirits and the delusion that the true enemy of America is always on the Right.  Having rejected the biblical God and the religious heritage of our civilization, they embrace instead an ancient order of beliefs of which Communism and Socialism are logical expressions.  A new world order is what they seek, but in order that it can emerge, the still remaining remnants of America&#8217;s Christian-based culture must be completely destroyed.<br />
What this means is that the spiritual catastrophe that unfolded in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany is unfolding on America’s stage.</p>
<p>Can this catastrophe be averted?</p>
<p><strong>Repentance: The Only Way Back</strong></p>
<p>Returning to David, prior to his obsession with Teilhardism he was destined to become a professor of anthropology at a Catholic university.  But under the influence of Teilhardism, he came to see that the Genesis account of creation ex nihilo, Adam and Eve as the first man and woman and parents of all mankind who fell and passed on Original Sin to all human beings were utterly contrary to modern scientific thinking and evolution.</p>
<p>Therefore David taught anthropology from a modern “evolutionary science&#8221; perspective, even going so far as to exclude traditional presentations of doctrines about creation ex nihilo and Original Sin.  But after introducing Teilhardism to his students, doubts arose when he observed the breathtaking transformative effects of this teaching upon Jonathan, one of his students, a priest who now insisted that <em>all the sacraments </em><em>are “…no more than expressions of man&#8217;s natural unity with the world around him.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>David’s eyes were suddenly opened and he saw clearly for the first time that Teilhardism exalted man as an animal and pictured,</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>God as no more than the very bowels of earth and sky and the spatial distances of the universe with all its expanding galaxies</em>.&#8221; (Martin, p. 107)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jonathan left the church and quickly founded his own cult among wealthy Manhattan families.  He preached that the universe and all people were evolving as ‘one’ in a naturally occurring mystical union which he called &#8220;<em>Abba Father</em>.&#8221; (p. 127)</p>
<p>Martin writes that Jonathan had come under the dominion of an evil spirit and David was called in to exorcise him.  However, the demon possessing Jonathan ridiculed David, saying they both believed the same things, therefore if Jonathan needed exorcism David needed it more.</p>
<p>Reeling in shock, David was led to an agony of soul-searching over the course of many weeks during which he re-examined and finally repented of the intellectual arrogance that led him to embrace Teilhardism and the &#8220;higher criticism&#8221; of Scriptures that reduced the Revealed Word to myth, allegory and delusion and the death of Jesus to an insignificant event of the evolutionary past rather than,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…an ever present source of personal forgiveness and unshakable hope for any future</em>.&#8221; (p. 149)</p>
<p>According to Martin, the evil spirit who had nearly succeeded in killing David’s faith now taunted him that to return to faith would entail slavery of mind and will.   But when a repentant David deliberately rejected the demon&#8217;s taunts,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;a great and breathtaking dimension full of relief&#8230;.flooded his mind and will and imagination&#8230;.And when he now looked at the world of nature around him&#8230;and heard the song of a mockingbird nearby, he received it no longer as he had while a Teilhardian evolutionist, as &#8216;intimations of molecules endlessly regrouping,&#8217; but rather &#8216;of endless life for each person, and of love without a shadow.</em>&#8221; (pp. 163, 165)</p>
<p>Speaking through Nietzsche, Zarathustra had declared the death of the Christian God on behalf of all willful unbelievers, but now for David, “<em>He’s alive and I’m forgiven</em>!”   His faith in God, Christ, the Holy Spirit and Scripture restored, David was ready to exorcise the evil spirit who possessed Jonathan.  He did so,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;in the name of God who created him</em> (Jonathan) <em>and you</em> (evil spirit), <em>and of Jesus of Nazareth who saved him!  You will depart and get back to the uncleanness and agony you chose.&#8221;</em> (p. 169)</p>

<p><em>“The Doctrine and Covenants leaves no doubt about the Mormon teaching of exclusivity when it says the LDS Church is, ‘the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased….’&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Glenn Beck recently threw a hissy fit on his daily radio program over “religious people [who] claim to be followers of Christ” getting upset that he was the featured convocation speaker at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.libertyuniversity.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO_xECD3B3zPxZIsAxjvPPrtwREQ">Liberty University</a> (LU).  Beck accused those who were concerned over a cultist preaching a sermon of “absolutely smearing” LU.</p>
<p>Let’s cut to the chase.  Glenn Beck is a Mormon in good standing.  Mormonism is a theological cult.  Thus Beck’s not an authentic Christian &#8212; period.  That some Christians have the temerity to object to a cultist giving a sermon at a Christian university offended Mr. Beck, thus his rant.</p>
<p>In an earlier column I wrote <em>Questioning with boldness: Which is it Glenn, are you a Mormon or a Christian?</em> I provided an in depth examination of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mormon.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSfdiwjY03mHgCU6gpbQij8y32HQ">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.  So I’m not going to spend a lot of time re-examine it here.  However, to help you get a handle on what Mormons believe, the following is a snippet of Mormon Christianity from my column.  As you will see, what they believe isn’t even close to biblical Christianity:</p>
<p><em>LDS Christianity outright denies the Trinity which is an essential of biblical Christianity.  So LDS Christianity and orthodox Christianity do not believe in the same God.  Mormon Christianity teaches that there are many gods who are overseers of other planets.  The god of planet Earth, the one they call Elohim, was just a man with a body of flesh and bones who progressed to godhood and was rewarded with his own planet.  [Founder]Joseph Smith taught, &#8220;God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens. That is the great secret&#8230; [Y]ou have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods have done before you&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Brigham Young believed in a plurality of gods: &#8220;How many Gods there are, I do not know. But there never was a time when there were not Gods&#8230;&#8221; (</em><em>Journal of Discourses</em><em> 7:333).</em></p>
<p><em>Mormons believe that after death they will become gods and will be rewarded with their own planet.  Thereafter they will spend eternity with their many wives (polygamy) producing offspring to populate their planet.  Traditional Christianity says that God is not a man. (Numbers 23:19) Mormon Christianity teaches that man first existed as spirits in heaven.  Biblical Christianity says that the physical body comes before the spiritual. (1 Cor 15:46) </em></p>
<p><em>And LDS Christianity teaches this humdinger: Jesus and Lucifer are spirit children of God, which makes them spirit brothers. </em></p>
<p>Bible believing Christians will understand that historic orthodox Christianity does not hold to any of what Joseph Smith conjured up.  There is no way that Glenn Beck is unaware of Smith’s beliefs and background.  Later in my column I brought to light that,</p>
<p><em>…it was Joseph Smith and subsequent Mormon hierarchy that attacked Christianity.  The truth is Joseph Smith’s religion, which he made up out of whole cloth, is an abomination to God! </em></p>
<p><em>It seems weird to me that Glenn Beck spends oodles of time gathering dirt on leftist radicals and that he digs deep to get the skinny on President Obama but has neglected to do some deep digging on …  Joseph Smith.  His church’s so-called prophet was a charlatan, a polygamist, an adulterer, and he was up to his eyeballs in the occult as was his father.  There&#8217;s plenty of evidence on the web for inquiring minds that want to know the truth about Mormonism’s founder.  </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F100825&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzr5qEQKGyIX0VSWtE8Pu5TVw9GQ">Source</a>)</p>
<p>For reasons known only to him, Glenn Beck holds the LDS Church in high regard.  Consequently, he’s deluded.  Why do I say that?  To put it bluntly, Mormonism is a satanic cult.  (Those who wish to research the LDS are invited to visit my <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Femailbrigade.com%2F301.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEi125g9pqzEb3p4Yl3SZmmI99DEw">website</a>.)  LU knows this full well, yet Beck was invited to speak to its students.  As I mentioned above, Beck preached a sermon saturated with Mormon theology.  Moreover, he shared a valuable artifact &#8212; Joseph Smith’s pocket watch.</p>
<p><strong>Liberty University Enlightens Us</strong></p>
<p>Following is LU’s explanation, in part, for their decision:</p>
<p><em>We have explained over the decades repeatedly that convocation is an opportunity for students to hear from people of all faiths and from all walks of life.  Liberty has also made it clear repeatedly that it does not endorse any statements made by any convocation speaker.</em></p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p><em>By contrast, our faculty are all required to profess Liberty’s statement of faith and to affirm our doctrinal statement.  Our students are all required to take many credit hours of theology and Bible courses, regardless of their major.  Our students have no question about what Liberty’s doctrinal statement is.  It is posted publicly for all to see. Our doctrinal statement is our public statement on Mormonism.  It is the same statement that Liberty was founded upon and it will never change.</em></p>
<p><em>College is about learning.  How can you defend what you believe if you don’t understand what others believe? </em></p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p><em>I believe our students are stronger in their faith because of our convocation speaker series and the wide diversity of views that they have been privileged to hear in person over the last few decades.</em></p>
<p><em>By the way, many conservative evangelical leaders who are closer to Beck than me have told me that they believe Beck has had a born again experience recently.</em></p>
<p>Hold it right there!  The “Glenn Beck is saved” rumor has been circulating for several years thanks largely to Wall Builders Founder <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fapprising.org%2F2012%2F08%2F22%2Fdavid-barton-gave-them-revisionist-history-they-wanted%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEC1Df2rJ1avF5y10wkS5Kpt_JqIA">David Barton</a>, “American evangelicals’ favorite historian.”  If it’s true, then why is Beck keeping the good news from his friends and fans?  Moreover, if he truly is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gty.org%2Fresources%2Fsermons%2F43-13&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_c-GNIMaMa3Bqg0QcTULSU9XLDg">regenerate</a> then why hasn’t he cut all ties to the LDS Church and joined a church where the true gospel of Christ is preached?</p>
<p>LU’s explanation continues:</p>
<p><em>I do not know his heart but our audience knows that he was speaking only for himself and expressing his personal opinions and beliefs, not those of Liberty University or even of Mormonism generally. As Jerry Falwell, Sr., our founder, often used to say about speakers at Liberty who had different views than him, Liberty students are smart enough to eat the fish and spit out the bones! I believe that’s as true today as it was in his day.</em></p>
<p>Are we to assume every student is mature in their faith and has spiritual discernment?  Are we to assume that every student who attends a Christian university has been born again and thus saved? Did it not occur to Jerry Falwell, Jr. that some of the students who ate the fish Glenn Beck dished up could have choked on the bones?!</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. Liberty University has the right to invite whoever they wish to speak to its students.  But lately they seem to have an affinity for Mormons, as Glenn Beck has spoken at the university twice.  In 2010 he delivered the commencement address and received an honorary doctorate degree.  Likewise, Mormon Mitt Romney gave the commencement speech in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>A Martyr?</strong></p>
<p>Is it true that Joseph Smith died a martyr, as Glenn Beck declared to LU’s students?  Not so fast, Glenn!  The factual account of what led to Smith’s death reveal that he and his brother Hyrum were charged with treason and conspiracy by Illinois authorities whereby they were arrested and imprisoned in a minimum security cell in the Carthage city jail. According to <em>The Martyrdom of Joseph Smith </em>by Eric Johnson:</p>
<p><em>He and his brother Hyrum Smith were murdered on June 27, 1844, by an armed mob, an event that has prompted Mormons to classify them as martyrs. It has caused others, however, to raise the question whether someone who dies in a gun battle fighting against his enemies can be considered to be a martyr. A close examination of the term reveals that one must meet specific requirements to be considered a martyr, which involve, for example, the reasons why one is put to death and the way one faces such a death. An investigation of the reasons why Smith was murdered and the actions he took to avoid this fate inevitably makes it difficult to maintain that Smith was “like a lamb led to the slaughter.”</em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mrm.org%2Fmartyrdom&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFacZ_fvaA9QUBqgyowYppq_iyPpQ">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Johnson offers several reasons why he believes it is not accurate to classify Smith a martyr which you’ll find in his essay under the heading: THE FALLACY OF DEEMING SMITH A MARTYR.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glenn’s Rant</strong></p>
<p>To spare you from having to read Beck’s ridiculous rant, I’ll post a few quotes from a piece by Erica Ritz:</p>
<p><em>This is why your churches are dwindling. … You think you’re standing for something, when indeed, you’re standing for hate and bigotry. I think Jesus was hanging out with prostitutes and sinners, wasn’t he? You won’t even listen to a man who says … ‘I challenge you to know your faith, not my faith, </em><em>your</em><em> faith so well that you’re willing to die for it. Stand with one another.’ That frightens you so much? If it does, you might want to consider that you’re on the wrong side.</em></p>
<p>Let’s see.  “Prophet” Joseph Smith said that “Christianity had become apostate, and all of their creeds were corrupt, and all of their followers were deceived.” Therefore, it fell to Smith not to “reform” the Christian church, but to “restore” it.”</p>
<p>And anyone who rejects Mormon heresy is “standing for hate and bigotry.”</p>
<p>More…</p>
<p><em>I look at every single lover of light and truth as my ally, my friend, my brother. … I look at everyone who is my enemy as my brother. I don’t care what you say; I don’t care what you think your belief is; I don’t care what your lifestyle is — you’re not going to change me. And I invite you to join me, join others of multiple faiths — never asking anyone to change their faith — asking you to </em><em>strengthen</em><em> your faith, whatever it is. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblaze.com%2Fstories%2F2014%2F05%2F20%2Fa-land-of-monsters-beck-fires-back-at-those-attacking-liberty-university-for-inviting-him-to-speak%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqMaAOb0SI_UwfJkoCE_eFXgPb5A">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Beck is oblivious to the fact that his <em>truth</em> is NOT biblical Truth.  On the contrary, what he’s “preaching” to anyone who’s willing to listen, and to a captive audience at LU by the way, is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fecumenism-ecumenical.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjd9SyoGRC0RpVX7taAQHRQm8Ijw">ecumenism</a>.  This New Age Mormon who professes Christ vociferously urges his followers to join together with other religious faiths and sing <em>We Are the World.</em>  If Michael Jackson were alive today, he’d be proud of Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>Glenn claims he’s read the Bible several times.  Perhaps he has.  However, he must have skipped over Paul’s teaching in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMAY0VmYFOOkoqEQo2lwys2YH5dQ">2 Cor. 6:14-16</a>:</p>
<p><em>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial?<sup> </sup> Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?  What agreement has the temple of God with idols?  For we are the temple of the living God.</em></p>
<p>Unbelievers are in darkness.  For this reason believers are not to unite with them in any sort of spiritual enterprise.  And those who are in darkness, the unsaved, are <em>not</em> our brothers and sisters.  Thus, we are commanded to share the gospel of Christ with them.  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fniv%2F1_corinthians%2F15.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAjWjlZhf3kV7yh2vW2rV6bnnrTw">1 Cor. 15:1-11</a>)</p>
<p><strong>One last quote from Glenn Beck’s hero, Joseph Smith where we learn a bit more of his bizarre and unbiblical understanding of God, which, by his own admission is the view of God Glenn holds as he is, after all, a professing Mormon:</strong></p>
<p><em>I say, if you were to see him [God] to-day, you would see him like a man in form&#8211;like yourselves, in all the person, image, and very form as a man . . . it is necessary that we should understand the character and being of God, and how he came to be so; for I am going to tell you how God came to be God. We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity,  I will refute that idea, and will take away and do away the veil, so that you may see . . . and that he was once a man like us; yea, that God himself the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth the same as Jesus Christ himself did.</em>  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fjoseph-smith-quotes&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYwtf-ftbue75cq3M-_9rjNcWwGw">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Now a bit of wise counsel from Erin Benziger in <em>What If ‘My God’ Is Bigger than ‘Your God’?</em> :</p>
<p><em>It is sinful pride that leads men into idolatry as they create imaginary gods that suit their own personal needs. It is the same sinful pride that prevents men from bowing low before the True God. It is this pride that refuses to acknowledge one&#8217;s own inability to offer anything truly &#8220;good&#8221; and refuses to acknowledge his own sinfulness. Yet it is God Who can, by wonderful, amazing grace, break a man of this pride and bring him to his knees in humility. It is God Who can bring the most stubborn, prideful man to a place of repentance and faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ. May we pray this day and every day that God would use us to proclaim the truth of His Gospel to such men, and may we pray that His Spirit would stir and work within those men to bring them to repentant, saving faith and knowledge of His Son. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.donotbesurprised.com%2F2014%2F05%2Fwhat-if-my-god-is-bigger-than-your-god.html%23more&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOiM7dgApsDmJ9tYERcUPA3ZhZFw">Source</a>)</p>

<p>Some professing Christians become infuriated when a “watchblogger” has the chutzpah to report on a false teacher by name, as if <em>naming names</em> is unbiblical.  High-profile leaders and bloggers who mention heretics by name are often accused of demonizing or judging them.</p>
<p>For example, when I expose <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiritual-research-network.com%2Frick_warren_purpose_driven.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGG_uXxP0Vx3qlFsAI6kyzKcdxKrg">Rick Warren’s</a> latest effort to unite with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lighthousetrailsresearch.com%2Fpeaceplan.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGy_bnykAgJBva8wVRTVmyQGEG31w">globalists</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.understandthetimes.org%2Fcommentary%2Fc145rickwarren.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEY6u5zDfpCLnEWT26EzJ0uRSnUzg">Catholics</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ocregister.com%2Farticles%2Fmuslims-341669-warren-saddleback.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXcxjfkxkw8qBqqpxt6ESsmuvy4A">Muslims</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F110124&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiF_q_2AwTLQ4sDLs1yW7u9WlT7Q">New Age/New Thought occultists</a>, and when I examine his <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120321&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHocIiR7OliHu8onwzT3pKZGsoXQ">health plan</a> and his penchant for<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XXOO91ISmQ">twisting Scripture</a> (he often uses it as a tool to cover his own ideas with a pretense of divine authority), complaints come pouring in by the truck load.  Many of his defenders write to set me straight on what Scripture says about “judging him.”  Others scold me for not giving him credit for all the good he has done, as if doing good deeds, meeting felt needs and ignoring doctrine and creeds is biblical.</p>
<p>Invariably someone will cite <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F18.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXN7SiIBirCXaFqnDO_MmBPNfN1A">Matthew 18:15-17</a> :</p>
<p><em>If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</em><em> But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.</em></p>
<p>And then they’ll ask if I’ve gone privately to Rick Warren to correct him.  My response is “Of course not!”  Why?  For the reason that Christian celebrities like Rick Warren are generally not accessible.  Many are, in fact, akin to Hollywood celebs.  No doubt some of them rationalize that their popularity affords them certain privileges, one of which is to choose not to have a dialogue with those of us who write anything negative about them.</p>
<p>Yet the Bible says that those who are in sin (false teaching is sin) must be admonished.  In <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F3_john%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-hBYu9nGEL7a1TScadxixYSeJ5g">3 John 1:9</a> the Apostle John calls out Diotrephes and promises to publicly correct him upon his return. In <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fgalatians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6rVc04g_LsLrEkux-BmPg9JJjdA">Galatians 2:11-14</a> Paul stands up to the highly esteemed Apostle Peter!   He even got in Peter’s face for fearing false teachers. What resulted from Peter’s “fear of man”?:</p>
<p><em>And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was <strong>led astray by their hypocrisy</strong>.  But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, ‘If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?’ </em>(bold added)</p>
<p>In context the Matthew 18 passages (above) addresses the ways in which the leadership must go about disciplining a brother or sister in their church who has fallen into sin.  It also provides the proper steps to take before excommunicating someone who refuses to repent.  First, we are to go to him in private and if he refuses to repent we are to go a second time taking with us two or more witnesses.  If he still refuses to repent, the pastor must go before the church and proclaim his sin.  Ouch!</p>
<p>It’s essential that elders are involved in the process.</p>
<p>Likewise, the passages in Matthew 18 don’t apply to doctrinal issues nor do they apply to Christians who have put their work before the world.  A person’s willingness to do so makes them fair game for anyone who wishes to scrutinize and even criticize his or her work.   Consequently, Christians who can’t stand the heat should get out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>But I’m drifting from my point.</p>
<p>When believers make a judgment, we’re not to judge <em>self-righteously.  </em>Moreover, we’re not to judge a person&#8217;s heart or motives.  Those who do are sinning.</p>
<p>Because I <em>name names</em> I’m often accused of being judgmental<em>.</em>  All I can do is respond with Scripture:</p>
<p><em>The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. ‘For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?’  But we have the mind of Christ.</em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_corinthians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAN_P3vy8vtdSA9BMuv1JJ0IsZeQ">1 Corinthians 2:15-16</a>)</p>
<p>What?  You mean the true believer has the <em>mind of Christ</em>?  Yes!  This is a difficult concept to grasp to be sure, so I’ll point you to Matthew Henry’s commentary:</p>
<p><em>The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man&#8217;s wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. … And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. <strong>In the Holy Scriptures</strong>, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. <strong>It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit</strong>. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.</em> (bold added &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fcommentaries%2Fmhc%2F1_corinthians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkQM00puhc_jjRsCEe_lBvo1jn_w">Source</a>)</p>
<p>In short, it is the spiritual man (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fdictionary-regeneration&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeSmsHuwpDbHzVRhBqrclFR5ftKA">regenerate</a>) who possesses the<em> </em>mind of Christ and has received the knowledge of His will which is laid out for us in Scripture.  Therefore, the believer who is truly walking with the Lord— <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F121018&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwAHNDAtZ8_olCeeFKfHkCIyjxBw">in His will</a>&#8211;has the authority to judge words and actions &#8212; especially when the teaching is unbiblical.</p>
<p>How do we know when someone’s teaching is unbiblical?  That’s easy!  Test his teaching against the Word of God and if it doesn’t line up with what’s in the Bible, then what’s being taught is not from God! And if what’s being taught is not from God it’s from another source – the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fephesians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGB5SqF8X145liKUJYRgKJW57jDyQ"> spiritual forces of evil in heavenly places</a>!</p>
<p>Bible teacher and expositor John MacArthur cautions:</p>
<p><em>It should be noted that </em>[Matthew 7:1-5]<em> has erroneously been used to suggest that believers should never evaluate or criticize anyone for anything. Our day hates absolutes, especially theological and moral absolutes, and such simplistic interpretation provides a convenient escape from confrontation. Members of modern society, including many professing Christians, tend to resist dogmatism and strong convictions about right and wrong. Many people prefer to speak of all-inclusive love, compromise, ecumenism, and unity. To the modern religious person those are the only “doctrines” worth defending, and they are the doctrines to which every conflicting doctrine must be sacrificed.  </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gty.org%2Fresources%2Fbible-qna%2FBQ112912%2Fjudging-others--the-verse-pagans-love-to-quote&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrUBC-iXQd89FWQ2OIABy_wddtXg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>In my experience, many professing Christians stubbornly stick to their position that those who expose the unbiblical teaching of Christian celebs are unfairly judging them so they play the<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F7.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGj-uvsnb1TcHINh9-24vYs_EdLGA">Matthew 7:1-5</a> card: &#8220;Judge not, that you be not judged” followed by a resounding rebuke from verse 5: “You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye?”</p>
<p>Christians who fail to grasp the notion that those who are Spirit-filled have the <em>mind of Christ</em> is mind boggling.  Only believers can make this claim &#8212; no one else can.  And that includes Miss Spirituality herself, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120507&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExBXarCqOHwN2-lSGzbTk6euqV8A">Oprah Winfrey</a>!  Why?  Since Oprah is unregenerate she cannot possible understand spiritual truth because her <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fromans%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAFEYj3q3W281ixj49e8hJhs1Dvw">heart is darkened</a>!</p>
<p>God’s ways and His Word make little sense to the unsaved.  Listen to what Paul says:</p>
<p><em>The natural person </em>[unregenerate]<em> does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.&#8221;</em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_corinthians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAN_P3vy8vtdSA9BMuv1JJ0IsZeQ">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>)</p>
<p>There is no other place we can learn about the things of the Spirit of God except in the Bible.  Moreover, the Bible’s the final authority in all matters of faith.  In <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fniv%2F2_timothy%2F3.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGpWBFp2aQSLXcKIQ1slt08QeIx3Q">2 Timothy 3:16</a> we’re told that “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.”  And  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_peter%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXLKUHGyfhn2ABKDyZX9x3jv3cxQ">2 Peter 1:21</a> says “For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”  Although every page of Scripture is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fbible-inspired&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFboVYMSim_EmwjclMZxUcgEBDyxw">God-breathed</a>, a growing number of Christians choose to reject hard to understand Bible stories and doctrines.  Two examples that come to mind are the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fcreation-story.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8utH6L2ydavMIRqRotgjy7nDe5w">Creation story</a> in Genesis chapters 1 &amp; 2 and our Lord’s teaching that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblebb.com%2Ffiles%2Fryle%2Ffire_fire.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXxWdDiE0wQVmTBwhD3VH4gZ22QA">hell</a> is a place of fire, demons and everlasting torment.  Some readers will be surprised to learn that Christ preached more on hell than all the other persons in the Bible put together!</p>
<p>It’s unbelievable how many professing Christians don’t study their bibles.  They may attend church regularly but because they’re biblically illiterate they have no clue if the pastor’s teaching God’s truth or outright heresy.  In many cases they wouldn’t know biblical truth if it walked up and bit them on the nose!</p>
<p>I regularly hear from Christians whose heart’s desire is to attend a healthy well-balanced church where they can be confident that they’re receiving good solid biblical teaching.  They’ve searched high and low to find a gospel teaching church near their home but there are none.  And they’re discouraged.  The sad fact is that only a handful of ministers still preach the <em>true</em> <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fwhat-gospel&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG91KnTefqfqTsg7mIy5pfiksGMFg">gospel of Jesus Christ</a>.  My advice is always the same: “Don’t give up searching!”  But this is a subject for a whole other article so I’ll move on.</p>
<p>As if we didn’t have enough to deal with in the visible Church, a large number of ministers and so-called Bible teachers in churches and on the airwaves are selling a false gospel to consumers. Front and center is the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emailbrigade.com%2F306.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1cs5obECebh5B0S2aWCZaKRQAGg">word-faith</a>/name-it-and-claim-it/prosperity charlatans such as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ligonier.org%2Flearn%2Fconferences%2Fchristless-christianity-2010-west-coast%2Fbecoming-a-better-you%2F%3Flb%3Dfalse%26format%3Dvideo%26aref%3DSS&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8E3sIya_5Fxu6IZqLexZksg1cNg">Joel Osteen</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBpnngnpzR4">T.D.

<p>Again, we’re not to judge a person’s heart or motives, but we can certainly judge the fruit they produce!  Jesus himself said<em>:</em></p>
<p><em>Every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.</em><em> A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F7.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGj-uvsnb1TcHINh9-24vYs_EdLGA">Matthew 7:17-20</a>)</p>

<p>In &#8220;<em>The attack on biblical creation in UK schools continues</em>,&#8221; Phil Robinson reports that in the dechristianized U.K. unrelenting attacks against special creation (Genesis account) display a level of aggressive intolerance that is hard to stomach, coming as they do from self-proclaimed scientifically-enlightened ‘voices of reason.’  Some schools have already banned the teaching of special creation in favor of evolutionary science.   (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>, Mar. 9, 2014)</p>
<p>Other shrill &#8216;voices of reason&#8217; go so far as to connect special creation to mental illness and child abuse. During a radio interview in Australia famous physicist and atheist propagandist Lawrence Krauss said that while in the United States recently, he stated that &#8220;<em>teaching creationism is child abuse and I think it is.&#8221; </em>(Prayer News, a publication of Creation Ministries, Apr. 2014)</p>
<p>Throughout the West and here in America a slash-and-burn operation conducted against the Genesis account, particularly its&#8217; literal and historical elements, is justified by the false idea that evolution is science, thus intolerance of special creation is often presented as a ‘science versus religion’ or ‘faith versus reason’ issue.   So successful has this war of attrition been that younger generations of Westerners and Americans have been disconnected from both Western history and its’ founding Christian-based worldview, thus like seedlings recently popped up from the soil are unconcerned that special creation, where the ultimate source of life, being and unalienable rights are found, has nearly been displaced by anti-human pagan conceptions positing billions of years of evolutionary transformism from lower kinds of things to higher and higher kinds of things&#8212; even non-human kinds of things:</p>
<p><em>“For us, the best way to create new (‘artificial’) life forms and intelligence is to allow them to emerge through evolution, as nature does, only in much shorter timeframes and with much greater efficiency and variety.”</em></p>
<p><em><br />
“For conscious evolution to be successful, we need to observe and understand the actual workings of nature, in all its dynamism, to the point of profound reverence, or ‘worship.’ This is what I call extreme nature-worshipping… From the perspective of extreme nature-worshipping, the real significance of Darwin’s evolutionary theory is not that humans descended from lower species, but that we can continue to evolve.”</em>(Cosmic Beings: Transhumanist Deism in Ted Chu’s Cosmic View, Institute for Ethics &amp; Emerging Technology, Giulio Prisco)</p>
<p>The vicious name-calling, seething resentment toward and censorship of the six day creation account and of all who profess and teach it should raise the eyebrows of any rational thinking person.  If evolution really is a fact of science then why the irrational name-calling, ridicule, scorn, shunning, resentment, intolerance and demonization?</p>
<p>The answer is that the zealous worshipper of evolution is the Spirit of our age that emerged out of the Renaissance whose answer to the Lord Jesus Christ is the Cross (crucify Him) and whose fulfillment will be the Wicked One. (2 Thess. 2:1-8)</p>
<p>From the Renaissance to our own time the Spirit has been transgressing, blaspheming, and departing that it need not obey His voice.   Like a dog returning to its own vomit, the Spirit has returned to its first love: the cult of demons in the Godless universe of matter, psychic energy, and animated forces where time is changed, past history rendered meaningless, and the liberated Spirit imbibes the cup of wrath, an intoxicating mixture of Babylonian Mysteries, incantations, spiritism, Gnosticism, sorcery, witchcraft, Hermetic magic, Kabbalah, reincarnation, astrology, and other devilish occult traditions.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation pinpoints Babylon as the post-flood center of an occult pagan Mystery religion based on advaitic monism, science of magic transformism, exalted priesthood, gnosis, secret initiations, psychic-powers, familiar spirits, androgyny, sexual perversions, and other evils.</p>
<p>Babylon embraced the Great Lie. Its inhabitants claimed the title, &#8220;I AM.&#8221; The root source of this evil religion and its occult power was the Great Dragon himself&#8230;.Lucifer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. <em>the Great Lie </em>(is) <em>the foundation stone of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, Sikhism, Taoism, the Kabala, the Greek Hermetic, Eleusinian and Gnostic beliefs, Neo-Platonism, all the occult creeds from Theosophy and the Masonic orders to the Rosicrucian&#8217;s (and) the New Age movement. The Great Lie is&#8230;the belief that man is God, that his true identity is the immortal self&#8230;that as God, he will never die </em>(and) <em>Sin and depravity are&#8230;illusions since this inner divinity is at man&#8217;s core.&#8221;</em> (The Great Lie, Tal Brooke, SCP Journal, Vol. 29:2-29:3, 2005)</p>
<p>Though the Spirit of our age claims the title “I AM” it nevertheless follows after and falls down before other fascinating men: theoreticians of evolutionary science, nature philosophy and evolutionary pagan theology. These charismatic Pied Pipers are possessed of surpassing powers of persuasion and inflexible determination of will to which the Spirit assigns more honor than to anything else.</p>
<p>The Spirit has usurped the throne of the Word Incarnate (John 1:1) because He is not good, not just or benevolent but a devil, an evil Tyrant Who, with His infliction of suffering in this life and eternal punishment in the next must be deposed. (Psalm 2:2-3)</p>
<p>Blaming our Lord for their own sins the proud, self-righteous Spirit of rebellion, hypocrisy and negation says to Him, “…<em>you are not my father</em>.”  My father is the god of forces, therefore:<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;I am I, I come out of myself, and in choice and action I make myself.&#8221;</em> (Daniel Bell, quoted by Herbert Schlossberg in &#8220;Idols for Destruction,&#8221; p. 43)</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the Spirit of our age is the “<em>striving human will</em>” seeking desperately to launch itself,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;into minor godhood in an evolving cosmos through the mechanisms of directed spiritual evolution, spiritualized science and spirit contact</em>.&#8221; The &#8216;new&#8217; spirituality now presents itself as the <em>&#8220;rightful replacement for the Revealed Word </em>(and)<em> proclaims its spiritual liberation from the worldview that informs Christianity and its freedom from </em>(the)<em> personal and wholly other God.  But this new way of self-salvation</em> (is)<em> little more than the refurbishing of an ancient spiritual mistake</em>.&#8221;  (The Making of the New Spirituality: the Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 279)</p>
<p><strong>“As it was in the days of Noah…” </strong></p>
<p>The ominous signs of this age are obvious, said the English theologian G.H. Pember (1837-1910) in his book, &#8220;<em>The Antichrist Babylon and the Coming Kingdom</em>.&#8221;  Just as it was during the pre-flood generations, open intercourse with demons (spiritism) is now common throughout Christendom and even in Russia.   In France it is the national pastime.   The apostles of the powers of darkness are everywhere proclaiming their scientific and evolutionary theories demonstrating that the world created itself and had no need of a Creator (p. 60) while the miseries which have resulted from sin,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>are blasphemously charged upon the Almighty, Who so loved the world as to give His son for it </em>(but is now)<em> impiously forbidden to curb and discipline the rebels who owe their existence to the breath of His mouth.  And when we see such men as John Stuart Mill </em>(and) <em>John Morley, the late Chief Secretary for Ireland&#8230;guiding their fellows to defiant insubordination, we can scarcely wonder that Bradlaugh&#8230;said, ‘This world might have been happy, had not the shadow of God fallen upon it.</em>” (pp. 35-36, 1888)</p>
<p><strong>Rise of Occult Evolutionary Science </strong></p>
<p>In the impeccably researched, &#8220;<em>The Making of the New Spirituality</em>,&#8221; James Herrick observes that the scientific tradition in Renaissance Europe developed around three basic approaches: the organic, the mechanical and the magical.   It was magical and/or occult science that provided the greatest impetus for scientific exploration. (p. 45)</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis underscores this point in “<em>The Abolition of Man</em>:”</p>
<p>“<em>You will even find people who write about the sixteenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know better. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse. I allow that some (certainly not all) of the early scientists were actuated by a pure love of knowledge. But if we consider the temper of that age as a whole we can discern the impulse of which I speak.”</em></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>God and the Knowledge of Reality</em>,&#8221; the Catholic philosopher and historian, Thomas Molnar (1921–2010), reveals the &#8216;temper of that age&#8217; as a spirit of rebellion against the Christian God, and this is why occult science and evolutionary thinking provided the greatest impetus. During the Renaissance, certain Christian theologians, mystics and scholars such as Emanuel Swedenborg had discovered Hermetic magic and occult Jewish Kabbalah texts which they studied and translated resulting in Hermetic Kabbalah. Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science – the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures (spiritual evolution) is the best proof of the divinity of Christ. In other words said Molnar,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;..by the time of the Renaissance the esoteric texts of the first centuries A.D. had acquired in scholarly and humanist circles an unparalleled prestige, confronting as equals the texts held sacred by the church. In Pico&#8217;s estimation, &#8216;nulla est scientia que nos magis certificet de divinitate Christ quam magia et Cabala&#8217; (there is no science that would prove for us Christ&#8217;s divinity better than magic and the Cabala.)&#8221; </em>(pp. 78-79)</p>
<p>Hermetic magic and Jewish Kabbalah are ancient Mystery Religion traditions, as affirmed by G. H. Pember in his classic work, &#8220;<em>Earth&#8217;s Earliest Ages.&#8221;   </em>Pember thoroughly examines the role of fallen angels in connection with the magic (occult transformism) they taught to pre-flood generations and compares them to the explosion of spiritism (open intercourse with evil spirits), astrology, the Mysteries and other occult traditions sweeping over Christendom.</p>
<p>Pember writes that the Mysteries are no longer veiled in mystery but boldly presented by the powerful occult brotherhood that emerged out of the Renaissance as the fruit of modern science, especially evolutionary philosophy, which the brotherhood assert was included in the instructions given,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>to the initiates of the Hermetic, Orphic, Eleusinian, and Cabbalistic mysteries, and were familiar to Chaldean Magi, Egyptian Priests, Hindu Occultists, Essenes, Therapeutae Gnostics, and Theurgic Neo-Platonists</em>.&#8221; (Pember, pp.243-244)</p>
<p><strong>Hermetic Magic<br />
</strong><br />
Hermeticism is an ancient Egyptian secret magic tradition based on a set of fourteen books known</p>
<p>collectively as the Corpus Hermeticum attributed to a mysterious figure known as Hermes Trismegistus. Implied in Hermeticism is an evolutionary process of magical transformism (spiritual evolution) moving from one kind of lower thing to another kind of higher thing:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Human beings are themselves the product of a long spiritual evolutionary process that moves from &#8216;creeping things&#8217; to fish, mammals, birds and then people.  Humans can&#8212;through occult knowledge and extraordinary ability&#8212;continue this evolutionary process and become daemons, then gods, and finally planets or stars</em>.&#8221; (The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 40)</p>
<p>With respect to Hermes identity, researchers of antiquity are divided.  Some believe Hermes was a mythical figure.  Others argue he was Ham or his son Cush.  The historian Samuel Shuckford argues that Hermes was Pathrusim, king of Thebais, the son of Mizraim, the son of Ham.   His Egyptian name was Tyoth or Thoth.  (The Sacred and Profane History of the World Connected, 1808)</p>
<p>In any case, it was Thoth-Hermes who instructed his brothers in the arts and science magic of alchemy or transmutation of a lower kind of thing into a higher kind of thing. For example, after a lengthy transformative process out of the eternally existing divine abyss (primordial matter), the self-created Sun-God Ra boasted that he “<em>came into being from primordial matter.”  </em>He made all the forms under which he<em> “appeared by means of the god-soul” </em>which he raised up out of Nu, primordial matter. (The Long War Against God, Dr. Henry Morris, p. 243)</p>
<p><strong>Occult Kabalah</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Kabalah is the key to the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists</em>.” (Occult Mason Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 626)</p>
<p>Like its’ Hermetic counterpart, Kabala implies a process of evolutionary transformism:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;the older Enoch book </em>(gives) <em>a fuller insight into the &#8220;Merkabah&#8221; and &#8220;Bereshit&#8221; lore of the ancients than the &#8220;Hekalot,&#8221; which present but fragments, while the central figure of the Cabala, Meṭaṭron-Enoch, is seen in ch. lxx.-lxxi. in a process of transformation</em>.” (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Helena Blavatsky, one of the key architects of Luciferian New Age pantheism, Kabalah derived,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em> from the older secret doctrines concerning divine things and cosmogony, which were combined into a theology after the time of the captivity of the Jews in Babylon. All the works that fall under the esoteric category are termed Kabalistic.” </em>(Blavatsky, Theosophical Glossary, p. 168)</p>
<p>The godless cosmogony of Kabala teaches the gradual condensation or evolutionary progression of a primal substance into visible matter.  This is a fundamental,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em> doctrine of the Cabala </em>(and<em>) is the ancient Semitic conception of the ‘primal ocean,’ known to the Babylonians as ‘Apsu’ and called by the Gnostics βύθος =</em>  (Anz, ‘Die Frage nach dem Ursprung des Gnostizismus,’ p. 98).</p>
<p>The Chaldean occult science and pagan Mystery Religion was embraced by apostate Jews during their captivity in Babylon and delivered to subsequent generations of initiates by word of mouth. According to Blavatsky, these initiates of the Chaldean tradition in the centuries before Christ were known as Tanaim:<br />
<em>“The kabalist is a student of ‘secret science’, one who interprets the hidden meaning of the</em></p>
<p><em>Scriptures with the help of the symbolical Kabala… The Tanaim were the first kabalists among the Jews; they appeared at Jerusalem about the beginning of the third century before the Christian era… This secret doctrine is identical with the Persian wisdom, or ‘magic’</em>.” (Ibid. p.167)</p>
<p>The Essenes were also associated with the Kabala. The Jewish Encyclopedia describes the cabalistic practices of the Essenes, which were Judaized elements of Eastern mystical traditions:</p>
<p>“<em>So, too, were the Essenes familiar with the idea of the journey to heaven…and they were also masters of angelology. The practice of magic and incantation, the angelology and demonology, were borrowed from Babylonia, Persia, and Egypt; but these foreign elements were Judaized in the process, and took the form of the mystical adoration of the name of God and of speculations regarding the mysterious power of the Hebrew alphabet …, ‘the name of God creates and destroys worlds’, to become, finally, foundations of the philosophy of the ‘Sefer Yetzirah</em>.&#8221;  (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Blavatsky the Essenes were pagan priests of the Greek goddess, Diana of Ephesus, where the Tanaim had established a college for instruction in the Chaldean mystery religion:</p>
<p>“<em>Essenes&#8230; had many Buddhistic ideas and practices; and it is noteworthy that the priests of the Great Mother at Ephesus, Diana-Bhavani with many breasts, were also denominated&#8230; It was at Ephesus where was the great College of the Essenes and all the lore the Tanaim had brought from the Chaldees&#8230; Essenes, believed in reincarnation</em>.” (Theosophical Glossary, pp. 113-14; The Secret Doctrine, Vol. II, p. 111n)</p>
<p>Eventually Alexandria, Egypt became the epicenter of cosmological and pagan religious ideas as well as the intellectual meeting point between Greek Mystery Religion/Hermetic magic initiates and nature sages and guardians of Kabala.  After the fall of Jerusalem, Alexandria was the center from which occult pagan Jews would disguise their mystery tradition in Christian terminology and attempt to penetrate the fledgling Church with heresy.</p>
<p>One of the primary tactics employed by Cabbalist pagan Jews for this purpose is the same one employed by their modern evolutionary Gnostic pagan counterparts.   It involves the reduction of the Genesis account, particularly the first three books, to allegory and myth, a ploy that eliminates the physical Adam from which all people descended and the sin that he transferred to the rest of the human race. This strikes directly at the heart of the Gospel: the need for the ‘last Adam’ to provide for us an escape from the wrath of God against sin incurred by the first Adam.  In this way, not only is the work of Christ on the cross rendered superfluous, meaning the heart of the faith is ripped out, but God is made responsible for sin and evil. (1 Peter 3:18-22; 1 John 2:22)</p>
<p>Long ago, the teachings of some of the early Church Fathers regarding the apostasy toward the end of the church age predicted the reappearance of this evil tactic. The fathers categorized it a Gnostic pagan heresy.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Heresies 6.10&#8243;</em> Hippolytus writes that the Gnostic pagan Simon Magus feigned faith and allegorized much of Scripture, especially Genesis, to support his evolutionary Hermetic and Gnostic occult pantheist teachings.   Church Fathers Ireneaus, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria reveal that Gnostic cult leader Marcion rejected the Old Testament, taught that the God of the Old Testament and his prophets are evil, made God the author of sin and removed all references that Christ was Creator (John 1:1)   (Ireneaus, &#8220;Against Heresies 1.26, 5.1,&#8221; Tertullian &#8220;Against Marcion 2.17,&#8221; Clement of Alexandria, &#8220;Against Heresies 4.29)</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Babylonian Mystery Religion is the mother of evolutionary Cabala, Gnosticism and all other occult pagan traditions:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;.especially does Gnosticism testify to the antiquity of the Cabala. Of Chaldean origin&#8230; Gnosticism was Jewish in character long before it became Christian&#8230; Gnosticism—that is, the cabalistic ‘Hokmah’ (wisdom)—seems to have been the first attempt on the part of the Jewish sages to give the empirical mystic lore, with the help of Platonic and Pythagorean or Stoic ideas, a speculative turn; hence the danger of heresy…of which the systems of Philo, an adept in Cabala&#8230;show many pitfalls&#8230;Jewish gnosticism unquestionably antedates Christianity, for Biblical exegesis had already reached an age of five hundred years by the first century C.E.  Judaism had been in close contact with Babylonian-Persian ideas for at least that length of time, and for nearly as long a period with Hellenistic ideas. Magic, also, which,&#8230;was a not unimportant part of the doctrines and manifestations of gnosticism, largely occupied Jewish thinkers. There is, in general, no circle of ideas to which elements of gnosticism have been traced, and with which the Jews were not acquainted.”  </em>(Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p><strong>Building  the New Tower of Babylon</strong></p>
<p>In the essay,<em> “The Paganization of Biblical Studies</em>,” Dr. Peter Jones, director of truthxchange and adjunct professor of Westminster Seminary CA., writes that the books of the evolutionary Gnostic pagan Presbyterian heretic Lloyd Geering, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University, are promoted by the most powerful element of the Spirit of our age—the international occult New Age Luciferian elite-pagans&#8212;as programmatic templates for the future utopian pagan community from the point of view of Christian apostasy and socialism undergirded by evolutionary pantheist orthodoxy.</p>
<p>According to Geering, the world&#8217;s future culture will be post-Christian, global, religiously pagan and evolutionary.  This agenda is remarkably similar to that of Teilhard de Chardins’ disciple, the ex-Roman Catholic Thomas Berry in his book, <em>&#8220;The Great Work</em>&#8221; which is also being implemented through texts of the UN&#8217;s global programs.</p>
<p>The rising New World Order will be post-Christian because evolution proves that human beings, as they evolved out of primordial matter, created language, then symbols, then religious explanations and God Himself.  Therefore tomorrow&#8217;s culture will be pluralistic, syncretistic, relativistic and poly-gendered because evolution integrates all scientific, cultural, religious, economic and human gender into one worldwide anthill thus when the global society emerges from the evolutionary process,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…it will require humanity to develop a new consciousness and a new form of spirituality</em>&#8221; because <em>&#8220;the new story which has become basic to the global world begins with a new word or idea&#8230;evolution.” </em>(ibid, Jones)</p>
<p>Like its’ mother, Mystery Babylon, the scientifically-enlightened ‘new&#8217; global religion of evolutionary transformism is occult pantheist advaita monism, which means that as an ancient impersonal god-force is within the cosmos, earth, human beings, rats, weeds, tumble bugs, cancer and everything else then all things are essentially &#8216;one.&#8217;  Since the god-force is within all things it is within the demonically &#8216;illumined&#8217; consciousness of every spiritually evolved initiate and adept.</p>
<p>This being the case, by means of trance states, brain-altering drugs, transcendental meditation, visualization, channeling, Zen Buddhism, Kundalini yoga, tantra, and other occult ways, the initiate can channel the god-force within thereby becoming a little god who controls matter because he controls mind. The physical world then, is an illusion because reality is inside the divine mind of the god-man.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is captured by Orwell in his book, “<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>” in which negation of the physical world is an integral part of the social and political philosophy of Big Brother and his despotic Party. At one stage in the book, Winston stumbles upon the shocking realization that in the end the Party would announce that two plus two made five because the logic of Big Brothers’ position required it since the existence of external reality was denied by his philosophy.  Thus when the Thought Police agent O’Brien tortures Winston for politically incorrect “wrong thought” he states,</p>
<p><em>“We control matter because we control the mind.  Reality is inside the skull.  You will learn by degrees, Winston.  There is nothing that we could not do.  Invisibility, levitation&#8212;anything.  I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to….You must get rid of these nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature.  We make the laws of Nature.” </em>(Orwell, “The New Spirituality and its Hallmarks, Alan Morrison, SCP Journal, Vol. 30:4-31:1, 2007, p. 19)</p>
<p><strong>Evolving Toward Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>The Aquarian Conspiracy</em>,&#8221; a book that has been called &#8216;the New Age Bible,&#8217; Marilyn Ferguson (1938-2008) admits that the ‘new age’ evolutionary pantheism and occult technologies being employed throughout America were at one time the private domain of ancient initiates.   In fact, as Constance Cumbey reveals in her thoroughly researched book, <em>&#8220;The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow,&#8221;</em> many New Age historians claim their occult religion and techniques originated in Atlantis and afterward were preserved in the ancient land of Babylon,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;and surrounding Plains of Shinar and from there disseminated throughout the earth, including Taoist doctrines of China, Mayan-Aztec teachings of Mexico and Central/South America; Great Spirit teachings of the American Indians, Hindu/Buddhist teachings of Asia, etc.&#8221; </em>(pp. 250-251)</p>
<p>After the Flood, said Shuckford, while the faithful Noah remained in the East and established the worship of the true God, eighty years after the Flood his rebellious son Ham and his sons together with other family members departed and eventually settled in the plains of Shinar where they resolved to build a tower, a monument to their own pride, vanity, ambition and rebellion against God. (ibid, p.94)</p>
<p>It was Noah’s son Ham, according to ancient Church Father Clement, who  ‘preserved’ and revived the Mystery Religion of ‘Atlantis’ and its attendant evils:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Fallen angels taught men the use of magical incantations that would force demons to obey man. After the flood Ham the son of Noah&#8230;discovered this and taught it to his sons.  This became ingrained into the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians.  Ham died shortly after the fall of the Tower of Babel.  Nimrod, called Ninus by the Greeks, was handed this knowledge and by it caused men to go away from the worship of God and go into diverse and erratic superstitions and they began to be governed by the signs in the stars and motions of the planets</em>.&#8221; (Recognitions of Clement 4.26-29)</p>
<p>In his well-researched book, &#8220;<em>Ancient Post-Flood History</em>,&#8221; Ken Johnson, Th.D., reports that the sons of Ham persuaded the people to accept that the true God was merely an impersonal creative force within all of nature, making man the highest form of life/god.  Through the power of persuasion, Ham and his sons revived magical evolutionary transformism, pantheism and idolatry. (pp. 47-48)</p>
<p>Eventually Ham was deified and worshipped by later pagans as the gods Cronus and Jupiter:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ham is represented by many writers as a very wicked, immodest, and profligate creature: Berosus (i) makes him a magician, and to be the same with Zoroast or Zoroastres, and speaks of him as the public corrupter of mankind; and says that he taught men to live as before the flood, to lie with mothers, sisters, daughters, males and brutes, and creatures of all sorts; and that he actually did so himself, and therefore was cast out by his father Janus, or Noah, and got the name of &#8220;Chem&#8221;, the infamous and immodest&#8230;&#8221; Upon seeing his father&#8217;s nakedness Ham,  &#8220;told his two brethren without; he went out of the tent after he had pleased himself with the sight&#8230; and in a wanton, ludicrous, and scoffing manner, related what he had seen: some of the Jewish Rabbins (k), as Jarchi relates, say that Canaan first saw it, and told his father of it; and some say (l), that he or Ham committed an unnatural crime with him; and others (m), that he castrated him; and hence, it is supposed, came the stories of Jupiter castrating his father Saturn, and Chronus his father Uranus.&#8221; </em>   Genesis 9:22 Gill&#8217;s Exposition</p>
<p>History did not begin after billions of years of evolution when primitive hominids swung down from the trees and discovered how to scratch crude symbols onto rocks.    Nor did it begin after the Flood.  At least 2,000 years of human existence preceded the Flood, meaning that when Noah and his family entered the ark they carried at least one hundred years of pre-flood memories, traditions, technology, and superior knowledge. Their world view was shaped by the historical Adam and Eve and the generations of their offspring.   Thus Noah and his family brought with them not only the knowledge of the personal God, Special Creation, fall of man, the Deluge, sacrifice to God for the propitiation of sin, the arts of weapon-making and warfare, knowledge of letters, symbols, math, architecture, science, cosmetics, and agriculture  but knowledge of  first-hand encounters with Watchers, their occult teachings, the Nephilim, and primeval pantheism tied to magic, spiritism, herbal abortifacients, human and animal sacrifice, drinking of blood, males marrying males and even beasts, and many other evils.</p>
<p>In affirmation, the eminent researcher of antiquity James Bailey said:</p>
<p>“…<em>human history can now be hesitantly traced back as an unbroken narrative to 4000 B.C….the picture emerging…is one of the Fall of Man in historic terms as well as his rise; it is a picture…more of degradation than of success; it is a picture of monotheism breaking down into polytheism and of the struggle to return to monotheism.  The establishment view of the history of religion gradually progressing from animism to polytheism </em>(then)<em> to monotheism is the reverse of facts</em>.” (“The God-Kings and the Titans: The New World Ascendancy in Ancient Times 1973, p. 296)</p>
<p>Four thousand years before Christ were the antediluvian generations and the Watchers in the post-flood world, making the billions of years of evolutionary transformism a fabulous fable.  It is neither ‘new’ (Ecclesiastes 1: 9-11) nor scientific except in the sense of pre-flood and post-flood occult science and attendant traditions revised and revamped for our own time, as Geering unhappily discovered.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones writes that Geering was surprised when he found out that the<em> ‘New Spirituality’ </em>has <em>&#8220;links with pre-monotheistic&#8230;nature religions,</em>&#8221; leading Jones to wryly comment that in an odd turn of events,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;.contemporary spiritual&#8217; evolution goes backwards!  Biblical theism disturbed evolutionary progress.  The clocks have to be put back </em>(for we are in the presence of)<em> a powerful pagan/Gnostic theological agenda, claiming to be spanking new, objective and scientific, but as old as the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>Clocks have to be turned back, all the way back to the days of Noah in the pre-flood world where evolution is closely connected to the devil’s lie that man is a being who though presently limited in time and space is nevertheless capable of achieving a great leap of being and magically evolving into a much more powerful god-like being in the future.</p>
<p>As the scientifically endarkened Gnostic pagan Spirit of our age simultaneously worships on the altar of ‘self’ as it self-righteously peers down its’ long, pointy nose and contemptuously sniffs and sneers at the remnant of backwards, unscientific, anti-evolution  faithful, in reality it is the entirely deluded pagan Spirit that is on a collision course with a modern version of the pre-flood world catastrophe&#8212;-and we know how badly that ended.</p>

<p>I wrote about the controversy swirling around the so-called Christian organization World Vision <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F140410&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOvDhB48vra3CLAz0g_2vD4jHxkg">here</a>.  For those who are unaware of what occurred on March 24, WV <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2Fct%2F2014%2Fmarch-web-only%2Fworld-vision-why-hiring-gay-christians-same-sex-marriage.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPgnNYtXYlNynFNqToTw2WBmfgjQ">announced</a> that they had plans to hire “married” homosexuals.</p>
<p>The backlash was fast and furious. Christian leaders, Roman Catholics, the pro-family movement and others in the faith community made it abundantly clear that they opposed WV’s decision to hire people in counterfeit marriages on the grounds <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> the Bible teaches <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that</span> homosexuality’s a sin.  It’s no secret that Bible-believers hold to the teaching that God established the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fchristianity%2Fdevotions%2Fmarriage&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4XLryW9om-O8q7R4dd5n330FTrg">marriage</a>sacrament for the purpose of bringing Him glory; thus marriage other than that which He designed does not bring glory and honor to Him. One would assume that WV’s president and board members had an understanding of what the Bible teaches on marriage – but maybe not.</p>
<p>They learn fast, though.  The board noticed a storm brewing when donors began to withdraw their financial support and they quickly changed course.  The public’s reaction was so strong that they reversed their decision faster than greased lightning.</p>
<p>In part 2 we will examine whether or not World Vision’s truly a Christian organization.  I mean, that’s the burning question, isn’t it?   One way to find out is to take a look at its website.  On the homepage they make the claim that they are a,</p>
<p><em>Christian humanitarian organization dedicated to working with children, families, and their communities worldwide to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps because I’ve spent a number of years exposing false teaching in the Church, likewise the cults and the occult, when I read the phrase “full potential” Anthony Robbins immediately came to mind.  Robbins is one of many Human Potential magnets.  He has taken on the trendy title “life coach.”  The life coach’s aim is to get you to a place where you can tap into your <em>full potential</em>.  Robbins’ beliefs are rooted in the New Thought movement.  (Those who wish to know more about New Thought can do so <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianheadlines.com%2Fnews%2Fvictory-for-religious-hiring-in-world-vision-case.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSgBad89QXr1KLaaIqki2-kV1RWg">here</a>.)  In essence “Syncretism between Christianity and early New Thought was a hallmark of this movement,” says cult expert Marcia Montenegro.</p>
<p>So &#8211; why would a “Christian humanitarian organization” choose to define itself using anti-Christian language inspired by New Thought rubbish?</p>
<p>Any organization that calls itself Christian should have as its main goal reaching families and communities around the globe with the gospel of Christ.  And if that’s not its stated goal then how is it any different from other secular organizations such as the <em>American Red Cross</em> or the <em>World Food Programme</em>. What sets Christian relief organizations apart from all the others is that they have a biblical mandate to evangelize the lost.  Jesus <em>commanded</em> His followers to:</p>
<p><em>Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.</em><em> Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</em>  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmark%2F16.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNRxbpT9bvmJx50XpOmf1hEuq_MA">Mark 16:15-16</a>)</p>
<p>For many years my husband and I sponsored children through WV.  Because it calls itself a Christian organization we just assumed that those in the field would be about the business of providing relief as well as evangelizing lost souls bound for hell.  When it became apparent to us that WV was moving more toward what is deemed a “social justice” organization, we wrote to express our concerns.  No response was forthcoming.  Eventually we stopped sponsoring children through WV and chose another organization.</p>
<p>The social gospel is a <em>false</em> gospel. (Discover more about social justice <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fsocial-gospel.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCNidz4M__mrIgNaoR--rQt4Fkyw">here</a>.)   What does Scripture tell us about spreading a false gospel?</p>
<p><em>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fgalatians%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYGxwgH4jy83VCXRzNONX8DHvTdQ">Galatians 1:6-9</a>)</p>
<p>I fully expect WV’s supporters will want me to demonstrate that WF prohibits proselytizing (sharing the gospel of Christ.)  In the process of researching for this piece I discovered all the proof doubters will need &#8212; and it comes right from the horse’s mouth.   I visited the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworldvision.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0srMyBUtvgtCnKcwkbW_XSl7klg">homepage</a>…clicked on <strong>Our-Impact…</strong>clicked on<strong> Faith-in-action </strong>and unearthed their goals and accomplishments:</p>
<p><strong><em>Our faith in Jesus is central to who we are</em></strong><em>, and we follow His example in working alongside the poor and oppressed. We serve every child in need that we possibly can, of any faith, or none. We partner with churches throughout the world, equipping them to meet the needs of their communities.</em></p>
<p>Scroll down the page to <strong>Our Approach </strong>and here’s what you’ll find:</p>
<p><strong>Do You Talk To People About Jesus?</strong></p>
<p><em>In all ways appropriate for a local context, we seek to witness to Christ — through our deeds of love and mercy, the character and conduct of our staff, and through our words of testimony. As we demonstrate the unconditional love of God to others, we are ready to give the reason for the hope within us, but expect people to evaluate the truth of our message <strong>by our actions</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>God created men and women in His image, giving each of us a free will. Therefore, we respect individuals — including their culture, faith, and beliefs. We respect the dignity and the right of all people to maintain and change their religious beliefs. We seek in every instance to be faithful ambassadors of the good news of Jesus <strong>through our actions</strong> (2 Corinthians 5:20) and hope that our lives will reflect God’s generous love for people, ultimately bringing glory and praise to Him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Do you expect the people you help to share your beliefs?</strong></p>
<p><em>We serve all people, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or gender. <strong>We do not proselytize,</strong> and we pledge never to exploit vulnerability to obtain a profession of faith. We do not feed the hungry as a means to an end. We feed the hungry because God cares about people who are hungry, and He wants them to be fed (Psalm 145:13-17).</em></p>
<p><em>Insisting that people hear a certain message or affirm a specific belief as a prerequisite to receiving our assistance violates codes of conduct established for disaster, relief, and humanitarian groups of which we are a member. However, our hope is that <strong>our work and lives</strong> would contribute to people becoming followers of Christ.</em></p>
<p><strong>How does being a Christian organization impact your work?</strong></p>
<p><em>Our faith in Jesus Christ is core to who we are. As an expression of God’s unconditional love for all people, especially vulnerable children, we serve alongside the poor and oppressed. <strong>We hope to live as followers of Christ by being active, visible bearers of God’s love</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>Relying on God’s grace and Spirit, we affirm the truth of the gospel and our hope in Christ <strong>through our character, speech, actions</strong>, and in the signs of God’s power at work in individual lives, in the communities where we work, and in all creation. </em>(emphasis added &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldvision.org%2Four-impact%2Four-faith-in-action&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsJQSxnVt01AmSQEvgDym4x6GCEg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>By its very words WV is a Christian organization that professes a belief in the gospel.  On its website it states that “Jesus is core of who we are.”  Yet its policy is not to proselytize?</p>
<p>Romans1:16-17 says:</p>
<p><em>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”</em></p>
<p>Instead of sharing the good news with those who are perishing, WV is all about doing “good works.”  Now don’t get me wrong.  I’m not saying Christians shouldn’t do good deeds and be “active, visible bearers of God’s love.”  But good works and sharing Christ with the lost go hand in hand.  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fromans%2F10.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfQPG1W0tVzXqufgn_mXOa7Fjikg">Romans 10:17</a> tells us that “Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”</p>
<p>In <em>Barnes’ Notes on the Bible</em>, the meaning of “hearing” is explained:</p>
<p><em>When it is said that faith cometh by hearing, it is not meant that all who hear actually believe, for that is not true; but that faith does not exist unless there is a message, or report, to be heard or believed. It cannot come otherwise than by such a message; in other words, unless there is something made known to be believed. And this shows us at once the importance of the message, and the fact that people are converted by the instrumentality of truth, and of truth only. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fcommentaries%2Fromans%2F10-17.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIWb52M-gk_flAySDxXTpnY92Qhw">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Just prior to WV doing an about face, Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, slammed the organization over its plans to hire unrepentant homosexuals.  Perhaps his, and articles like it, is the reason Richard Stearns and the board reversed their decision and decided to repent.  The question many people are asking at this juncture is how do we know that the leadership has sincerely repented of their willingness to mollify the radical homosexual lobby’s demand for them to hire gay people?  Time will tell.  However, it’s evident that at least for the time being, board members have decided it’s not in WV’s best interest to go against Bible believers and faith groups because they’re the ones who pay the bills!<br />
I’m out of room so I’ll end with an excerpt from Albert Mohler’s stinging rebuke – before WV repented:</p>
<p><em>Writing to the Corinthian Christians, the Apostle Paul stated: “Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.” [1 Corinthians 6:9-10]</em></p>
<p><em>The leader of World Vision U.S. now claims that the Bible is not sufficiently clear on the sinfulness of same-sex sexuality and relationships, but he also claims a “mission of building the kingdom</em>.”  <em>The Apostle Paul makes homosexuality a kingdom issue, and he does so in the clearest of terms.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, Paul’s point is not that homosexuals are uniquely sinful, but that all of us are sinners in need of the grace and mercy of God that come to us in the gift of salvation. Thanks be to God, Paul follows those words with these: “And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.” [1 Corinthians 6:11]</em></p>
<p><em>The worst aspect of the World Vision U.S. policy shift is the fact that it will mislead the world about the reality of sin and the urgent need of salvation. Willingly recognizing same-sex marriage and validating openly homosexual employees in their homosexuality is a grave and tragic act that confirms sinners in their sin — and that is an act that violates the gospel of Christ. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.albertmohler.com%2F2014%2F03%2F25%2Fpointing-to-disaster-the-flawed-moral-vision-of-world-vision%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvPKHLwaT-fRFzzO7OBGEzbze5aw">Source</a>)</p>

<p>The dust has settled a bit since Christian humanitarian aid organization World Vision’s March 24 <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2Fct%2F2014%2Fmarch-web-only%2Fworld-vision-why-hiring-gay-christians-same-sex-marriage.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPgnNYtXYlNynFNqToTw2WBmfgjQ">announcement</a> that it would hire gay couples who are legally married in the state in which they reside.  Since “World Vision-gate” remains a hot topic, it’s time for some introspection; likewise to do some digging to find out if WV truly is a Christian organization, as it claims.</p>
<p>When WV announced its decision to hire gay people, not surprisingly Bible believing Christians found the decision unsettling.  Clearly WV’s Board of Directors chose to ignore the plain teaching of Scripture regarding <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fchristianity-and-homosexuality&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGW94u-eKztKHlzwtaUdPnqeztFvQ">homosexuality</a>.   As a result, a large number of believers, including some high-profile evangelical leaders, took to the blogosphere in protest and thousands stormed WV’s website.  Board members hadn’t counted on the huge uproar their unbiblical decision would cause.   Certainly they expected WV’s financial support to take a minor hit from unhappy sponsors. But evidently no one anticipated just how big the hit would be.  According one source 10,000 sponsors pulled out. (More on this in a moment.)</p>
<p>Within 2 days the board reversed its decision.  Immediately Richard Stearns, president of World Vision issued a public apology.  The following is an excerpt of his apology from <em>Christianity Today</em>:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The last couple of days have been very painful,&#8221; organization president Rich Stearns told reporters this evening. &#8220;We feel pain and a broken heart for the confusion we caused for many friends who saw this policy change as a strong reversal of World Vision&#8217;s commitment to biblical authority, which it was not intended to be.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Rather than creating more unity [among Christians], we created more division, and that was not the intent. … Our board acknowledged that the policy change we made was a mistake … and we believe that [World Vision supporters] helped us to see that with more clarity … and we&#8217;re asking you to forgive us for that mistake.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;We listened to [our] friends, we listened to their counsel. They tried to point out in loving ways that the conduct policy change was simply not consistent … with the authority of Scripture and how we apply Scripture to our lives. … We did inadequate consultation with our supporters. If I could have a do-over on one thing, I would have done much more consultation with Christian leaders.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;What we are affirming today is there are certain beliefs that are so core to our Trinitarian faith that we must take a strong stand on those beliefs. … We cannot defer to a small minority of churches and denominations that have taken a different position.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Yes, we will certainly defer on many issues that are not so central to our understanding of the Christian faith. … But on the authority of Scripture in our organization&#8217;s work [and employee conduct] &#8230; and on marriage as an institution ordained by God between a man and a woman—those are age-old and fundamental Christian beliefs. We cannot defer on things that are that central to the faith.&#8221;  </em></p>
<p>Here’s what Stearns said about the large number of child sponsorships that were cancelled:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;That grieves us, because the children we serve will suffer because of that.  … But our choice is not about money or income. It&#8217;s a sincere desire for us to do the right thing. To be consistent with our core values and to respond to the legitimate feedback and counsel we have received from supporters and friends of World Vision.&#8221; </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2Fct%2F2014%2Fmarch-web-only%2Fworld-vision-reverses-decision-gay-same-sex-marriage.html%3Fpaging%3Doff&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAhyNRy_o9Dl9_LLITSKvvXhV4cg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Doing the right thing meant WV had to throw gay people under the bus.</p>
<p>Stearns now wants us to believe that the organization needed feedback and counsel from supporters and friends to help them realize that homosexuality is a sin and as such practicing homosexuals must repent and turn to God.</p>
<p>As previously stated, it was alleged that10,000 kids lost their sponsorship in those 2 short days after the original announcement. Who made this claim?   Far left blogger Matthew Paul Turner. And who did Turner blame for the loss of support?  “So-called born again Christians.”  In a blog post Turner grumbled:</p>
<p><em>Last Monday, the day of the announcement, World Vision’s call center received 7000 calls and a loss of 2000 child sponsorships. That’s just in 12 hours on Monday! The following day those numbers swelled. And then on Wednesday, within minutes of World Vision announcing that it was reversing its decision, the calls stopped and, according to Stearns, “the bleeding stopped.” …  It took several days to count the total loss of sponsorships, a number that eventually rose to “just about 10,000 children,” according to Stearns. A handful of people did call back, hoping to start up their sponsorships again. But the majority did not.</em></p>
<p>Later in his piece Turner cuts lose on the born again believers who dared to withdraw their sponsorship:</p>
<p><em>There’s nothing “moral” about using a kid as a bargaining chip to punish a Christian organization for making a decision that you don’t agree with. There’s nothing honoring about using children to force an organization’s hand. There’s nothing “pro life” about that. There’s nothing remotely “Christlike” about that. It’s downright disgusting, manipulative, and sad. If I was a Pentecostal, I might even call it demonic.  </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmatthewpaulturner.com%2F2014%2F04%2F03%2Ften-thousand-kids-in-2-days%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGpK6-CIVkQUJ3CgRT1DN3FGF3czA">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Demonic?  No!  What really happened here is that Bible believing Christians sent a message to World Vision:  We will not sponsor organizations that compromise biblical truth.</p>
<p>Amy Spreeman of  <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstandupforthetruth.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFd0tJX2VPsZlelYnC3Hx7lPtaD6g">Stand Up For the Truth</a></em> who’s been closely following World Vision-gate isn’t buying Turner’s allegations.  She brings to light two things we need to ask and consider:</p>
<p><em>1. Is there proof that 10,000 kids are now abandoned?<br />
2. Do “sponsorship fees” really go to the kids?</em></p>
<p><em>Nope and nope. First, WV president Richard Stearns this week gave out this figure via phone conference to a small group of <strong>hand-picked bloggers who are pro-gay</strong> <strong>marriage</strong>. The blogger with the biggest audience is Matthew Paul Turner. He works for World Vision. ‘Nuff said. </em>(emphasis added &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstandupforthetruth.com%2F2014%2F04%2Fcan-please-least-talk-world-vision-accurately%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7GIKApei35h8kqle9HJeItBCCSg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>When it comes to the Bible’s clear teaches on <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fbible-homosexuality&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxbkZ5CnjqebBxbjtB-OobNpV4nA">homosexuality</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fchristianity%2Fdevotions%2Fmarriage&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4XLryW9om-O8q7R4dd5n330FTrg">marriage</a>, WV board member Jacqueline Fuller appears to be as biblically ignorant as Matthew Paul Turner is.  On April 3 she resigned from the organization “because she disagreed with the agency backtracking on a policy that would have recognized employees&#8217; same-sex spouses.” (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nwcn.com%2Fnews%2FWorld-Vision-same-sex-mariage-253732001.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxUWmEf8hLJFpxKrePeIlN9KZRNg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Here’s the crux of the matter as stated by <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fthecripplegate.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUVevb0TBq6sZpNWde5xO88UxHyQ">The Cripplegate’s</a></em> Jesse Johnson:</p>
<p><em>The homosexual agenda continues to advance and Christians really ought to <strong>come to terms with the fact that it is only a matter of time when our view of marriage will be plainly illegal</strong>. As has been <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.redstate.com%2F2013%2F03%2F29%2Fyou-will-be-made-to-care%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8ItvZwW9oKx4h8UliaJuPzkdiHg">said elsewhere</a>, as that agenda moves forward in our country at breakneck speed, ambivalence is not an option; you will be made to care. As World Vision’s recent announcements illustrates, it will soon not be practically possible to simply love others and preach the gospel, without having a clear explanation about what the Bible says about homosexuality.</em> (emphasis and link in original &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fthecripplegate.com%2F4-lessons-in-world-visions-flawed-vision%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrybnjNlc0AVAt_CA1DVSkugiLTg">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Spenser vs. World Vision</strong></p>
<p>In 2007 WV found itself in Federal court defending its right to hire only those who shared in its Christian beliefs.  The lawsuit went on for four years.  Then in October 2011 the decision came down on the side of World Vision.  The headline in <em>Christian Headline News</em> read:</p>
<p><strong>VICTORY FOR RELIGIOUS HIRING IN WORLD VISION CASE</strong></p>
<p>According to the report:</p>
<p><em>As a requirement for employment, Silvia Spencer, Ted Youngberg and Vicki Hulse had acknowledged their agreement and compliance with World Vision&#8217;s statement of faith upon being hired. In November 2006, however, the three were terminated by World Vision after an internal investigation determined Spencer, Youngberg and Hulse did not believe in the deity of Jesus Christ and denied the doctrine of the Trinity (&#8220;There is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son and the Holy Spirit), a fundamental tenant of the organization&#8217;s core values.</em></p>
<p><em>Claiming discrimination, the disgruntled employees filed a complaint against the Federal Way-based humanitarian aid organization in 2007. The lower court granted World Vision a summary judgment and, in 2009, the plaintiffs appealed the district court&#8217;s decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Judges found the reason for firing was not in dispute. On August 23, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled 2-1 that World Vision was a “religious organization” and therefore exempt from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars religious discrimination in hiring.</em></p>
<p>From the same article:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I am pleased, relieved and gratified with the court&#8217;s action,&#8221; said World Vision&#8217;s U.S. president, Richard Stearns, in a statement. &#8220;After four years of litigation, we at World Vision U.S. may now put this matter behind us, and continue our policy of hiring only Christians.&#8221; </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianheadlines.com%2Fnews%2Fvictory-for-religious-hiring-in-world-vision-case.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSgBad89QXr1KLaaIqki2-kV1RWg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Reading this statement from Sterns makes one wonder why, after battling for four years to have the right and freedom to hire only those who cling to WV’s supposed biblical views and values, would this professed Christian organization decide to hire “married” homosexuals?</p>

<p>When defending Western Civilization, some confuse that secular humanism, practiced as the current dominate popular culture, represents that lineage. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The decadence and decline in the West is undeniable. Yet the heritage upon which European civilization is based, owes a profound debt of gratitude to the societies that developed out of the brute force of empire and adopted principles of natural law and individual dignity. A direct correlation to the gospel of Christ becomes the centerpiece of this glorious tradition of universal brotherhood, that keeps man’s inhumanity to man in check.</p>
<p>The well-documented failures of institutions and regimes would have been far worse if left to the devices of pagan appetites or atheist’s hubris. However, the memory of the eternal struggle is short lived in the minds of most people. Confusion reigns because of a lack of knowledge, perspective and especially will, to admit that the New World Order is the invention of satanic factions that lust for control of the entire planet and beyond.</p>
<p>Therefore, the extraordinary essay by Pat Buchanan, <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/putin-vs-cultural-marxism-whose-side-is-god-on-now">Putin vs. Cultural Marxism: Whose Side Is God on Now?</a>, is a required penance for all those who have sinned.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In his Kremlin defense of <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-return-of-ethnic-nationalism-is-europe-cracking-up">Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea</a>, Russia is a Christian country, Putin was saying.This speech recalls last December&#8217;s address where the former KGB chief spoke of Russia as standing against a <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/news/6007/print">decadent West</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values. Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With Marxism-Leninism a dead faith, Putin is saying the new ideological struggle is between a debauched West led by the United States and a traditionalist world Russia would be proud to lead.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Before dismissing Putin as just a KGB thug, read <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/061012.html">Vladimir Putin Nemesis of the New World Order</a>. Then do your own research on <a href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Karl_Marx.html">Marx</a> and <a href="http://www.jewwatch.com/jew-leaders-lenin.html">Lenin</a>’s clan of <a href="http://www.analysis-news.com/AnUnderstanding/Understanding-X.htm">Khazar Bolsheviks</a>. Finally, transcend the issue just about the motives of Putin and focus on the Christian roots of the Russian population.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfaturiortodoxe.ro/orthodox/orthodox_advices_seraphim_rose_american_orthodoxy.htm">The Orthodox Revival in Russia</a> by Fr. Seraphim Rose cites the experiences and significance of <a href="http://batr.org/view_/052902.html">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> and Father Dimitry Dudko.Solzhenitsyn spoke of Gulag—a secular term; Fr. Dimitry speaks of Golgotha—the Christian understanding of the Soviet experience. The central part of Fr. Dimitry&#8217;s—and contemporary Russia&#8217;s—message to us is that all the sufferings inflicted by atheism have a meaning—we can find Christ in them… Here are a few passages of Fr. Dimitry&#8217;s teaching:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In our land has occurred Golgotha; the torments of all the martyrs begin gradually to cleanse the air… The present crucifixion of Christ in Russia, the persecutions and mockings only lead to the resurrection of faith in men… This gives us strength, firmness, makes us better than we are now… Let us imagine the state of our martyrs. Did the thought of sinning occur to them at this moment? No matter what kind of sinners they may have been in this minute they become saints… And those who suffer for those condemned to death also become better. How many martyrs there have been in Russia—and therefore, how many holy feelings! Will these holy feelings really give no fruit? And perhaps we live and will live only by the feelings of the holy martyrs, being supported by them… In our country now is Golgotha. Christ is crucified. Golgotha is not merely sufferings, but such sufferings as lead to resurrection and enlighten men… Our time can be compared only with the first three centuries of Christianity, and perhaps then it was even easier; then they did not yet know all the refinements of subtle torture… If one compares the religious state here and in the West, the balance is on our side. Why? Because here we have Golgotha, and there they don&#8217;t. Does an abundance of material goods give a religious rebirth? … Here we have nothing, but if people believe they are ready to die for their faith.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fr. Rose provides his assessment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His truthfulness and fiery faith have made many enemies—sadly enough, even among Orthodox Christians. Some have found him too emotional, too apocalyptic, too messianic—and it is true that such a fiery, urgent, Orthodox preaching hasn&#8217;t been heard in Russia and probably the whole Orthodox world since the days of St. John of Kronstadt; many Orthodox people have become self-satisfied with their &#8220;correct and proper&#8221; Orthodoxy and are somehow offended when Orthodoxy is preached and communicated so warmly to everyone who will listen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you just imagine such a discussion in the western media or even among Dispensationalist Christians, who are preoccupied in taking up the sword to champion Zionism? Any comparison between the West and Mother Russia would be incomplete without the insight of the audacious Brother Nathanael Kapner, <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=205">Putin’s Purge Of The Rothschild Money Changers</a>.In a televised Christmas message on January 7 2008 Putin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Russian Orthodox Church contributes to the promotion of moral values in society. One should not completely draw a line between the culture and the church. Of course by law in our country the church is separate from the state. But in the soul and the history of our people it’s all together. It always has been and always will be.&#8221; — <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/138/story_13827_1.html">Here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brother Nathanael leaves nothing unsaid in <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=84">PUTIN VS JEWS OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2006 <a href="http://www.twq.com/08spring/docs/08spring_gaddy.pdf">Putin had paid off Russia’s debt to the Rothschilds</a>. Russia’s financial dependence on the Jewish financiers was now over. Putin could then establish what became his <em>Russian Unity Party’s</em> 2007 <a href="http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2007/84/01.html">campaign slogan</a>: Putin’s Plan Means Victory For Russia! This slogan continues to make the<em> New World Order</em> Jews very nervous…<a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=198">Here</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While these sentiments are several years old, make no mistake about it, they are even truer today, with the efforts of the <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/040313.html">BRICS Development Bank to replace the IMF</a>.</p>
<p>For a more current description, look to Pastor Scott Lively in <a href="http://www.scottlively.net/2013/10/18/report-from-moscow/">Report from Moscow</a>, and a summary of a reversal of roles, read on.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Russia is today experiencing a Christian revival and is decidedly NOT communist. Some 30,000 churches have been built in the last year, and the ones in Moscow are reportedly overflowing with worshippers on Sundays. Most of the church is Orthodox, which is steeped in tradition, but at the same time relevant to the modern society.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;How incredibly ironic it is that Russia is now our best hope for stopping the conquest of the world by the &#8220;progressives.&#8221; On <a href="https://02varvara.wordpress.com/tag/fr-dmitri-smirnov/">Father Dimitri’s</a> television show, I made the point that the Americans and the Soviets both won and both lost the Cold War. The Americans broke the Soviet system through economic strategies and tactics. But before they collapsed, the Soviets poisoned the United States with Cultural Marxism, promoting moral degeneracy and family breakdown through so-called &#8220;progressive&#8221; ideology. Today, post-Soviet Russia is re-emerging as a Christian nation, while the United States is becoming a &#8220;Gay Soviet Union.&#8221; What a strange turn of events.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Echoing this conclusion is the report <a href="http://www.spc.rs/eng/russia_religious_revival_brings_new_life_orthodox_media">In Russia, a religious revival brings new life to Orthodox media</a>. &#8220;After 70 years of state-imposed atheism and 20 years that have run the gamut from glasnost to post-Soviet chaos to a revival of Russian pride, Russians have increasingly embraced their Orthodox roots.&#8221; The video <a href="http://youtu.be/qzqnhj8W9Ac">Christianity Grows in Russia &amp; Declines in the West</a> is to the point.The Latin Papacy has lost its spiritual way often over the millenniums and the Scofield Christian-Zionist apostate bible thumpers betray the Gospel of Christ with their devotion to the Talmud perversion of the Old Testament. Both need to seek repentance. Once the enemy of Christianity, when Russia was Rothschild’s USSR, today a revival of Christianity has started.</p>
<p>Western Secularism, which encapsulates the immoral ethos that underpins the globalist economic model, based upon a rejection of authentic Christian teaching, is the downfall of humanity.</p>
<p>If Russia can salvage their society from atheist communism, surely the West has the ability to humble themselves and repent for their depraved chutzpah and wicked ways. The <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/index.html">Totalitarian Collectivism</a> that has destroyed the Christian culture on both sides of the Atlantic must return to their traditional roots.</p>
<p>Michael Hoffman on ‘<a href="http://realcurrencies.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/meet-the-real-deal-michael-hoffman-on-usury-in-christendom/">Usury in Christendom</a>’ is essential, <em>‘…freedom from interest on money, is essentially the battle for freedom from the Money Power</em>’. The West has become the &#8220;Money Changers&#8221;, because the temple has subverted commerce by heretical destruction of faith and separation from God. By destroying traditional Christian religious belief, the secular body is defenseless. Such a message is radical to most, because it is reactionary to the spiritual non-believer.</p>
<p>Former Russian President <a href="http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2011/11/president-dmitry-medvedev-speaks-on.html">Dmitry Medvedev</a> has spoken of the &#8220;fruitfulness of cooperation between the Russian Orthodox Church and government and public institutions and called the revival of Orthodox Christianity in Russian in the past two decades a miracle.&#8221; The West needs a spiritual revival of its own conception. If the Russia Bear can be tamed, what prevents the American eagle from souring once again?</p>

<p>What happens when an institution becomes more important than the cause for which the institution was formed? How long should people who believe in the cause remain loyal to such an institution? And at what point does loyalty to such an institution comprise an abandonment of the cause itself?</p>
<p>I’m afraid the majority of Americans have been institutionalized in a manner not unlike the way prisoners are institutionalized after a long period of confinement. After a point, a prisoner is so conditioned to accepting the circumstances of his confinement that, should he be released from confinement, he truly would be unable to cope. Such seems to be the mentality of a majority of us today.</p>
<p>Christians have been institutionalized. The reason and purpose of the church or Christian organization is no longer relevant. Generations have grown up reciting the same liturgies, regurgitating the same prayers, and rehearsing the same programs until the reason for it all doesn’t even matter. But take the institution away from them, and they would not be able to cope.</p>
<p>The Pharisees despised the Lord Jesus because He challenged the religious institutions that had come to govern people’s lives. I am convinced if Jesus came to America today, He would be just as despised by the vast majority of our religious leaders as He was by the Pharisees.</p>
<p>The Church that Jesus built in the Book of Acts owned no buildings, was indebted to no lenders, took no tax benefits from the civil government, had no denominational hierarchy, and identified itself with no ecclesiastical brand. And the Church was just as persecuted by the religious establishment as Christ was.</p>
<p>One of the reasons one may know that the modern church is so unlike Christ and the apostles is by the persecution that it never experiences. Just as the Pharisees were bosom buddies with the Roman Empire’s governing elite, so are our religious leaders today. Caesar was very generous in sharing the fruit of his tyrannically-extracted bounty with his allies in the Jewish Sanhedrin. And they were happy to return the favor by insisting that the Hebrew people submit to Caesar’s harsh rule over their lives.</p>
<p>The Pharisees also enjoyed a cozy relationship with the moneychangers. The moneychangers were descended from a long line of corrupt banking interests that dated all the way back to the Edomites. We are not talking about your friendly local banker here. These were highly organized, well-positioned money-manipulators. Jesus was so incensed with their manipulation and theft within in the Temple that he used physical violence to remove them from the property. He is recorded as doing this twice in the Gospel narratives. Note that after the second time in which it is recorded that He drove out the moneychangers (with a whip, no less), the Pharisees soon had Jesus crucified. There is no question that one of the reasons Pilate ordered Jesus to be scourged with a whip was in direct retaliation for the manner in which Jesus whipped the moneychangers. Remember, the moneychangers were from a very well-ensconced, elitist national (and even international) organization.</p>
<p>And lest you think all of this is irrelevant to today, the moneychangers are still very much with us. The Rothschilds, Rockefellers, and other members of the international banking elite, are the direct descendants of the moneychangers of Jesus’ day. And if you ever have an opportunity to ask one of them about it, they will proudly admit it.</p>
<p>Yes, the Pharisees institutionalized religion. This accomplished two things: 1) it helped enslave the people, 2) it helped make them rich. The institutionalized church is accomplishing much the same things today.</p>
<p>The establishment church is doing as much to enslave people as any other institution in the world. Our political institutions and educational institutions have nothing on the church for making good little subjects and serfs to the all-powerful state. And if you don’t think that a host of church leaders are not reaping the spoils from assisting our taskmasters, you’re not paying attention.</p>
<p>Many, if not most, of these big-name TV evangelists have as many houses and yachts and Swiss bank accounts as any big-name Hollywood actor or politician. In some cases, more. Most of these big-church pastors are bathing in luxury. Many of them take the kinds of vacations that only CEOs of the biggest corporations or presidents could afford. Do you really think that the IRS rules and regulations governing these non-profit corporations, called churches, really bother these church leaders? Get real!</p>
<p>No wonder all of these “successful” preachers are constantly teaching their congregations to always submit to the government. No wonder they have no interest in abandoning their 501c3 tax-exempt status. They are in the exact same position as were the Pharisees of old. And they are just as effective in helping to enslave people today as were the Pharisees.</p>
<p>The institution of the church&#8211;along with its programs, formalities, buildings, rituals, etc.,&#8211;has become more important than the purpose for which the church was created. Instead of preaching the liberating message of the Cross, which frees men from the fetters of sin&#8211;and that includes sinful political and financial fetters&#8211;the church is preaching a message of subjugation and enslavement. It is teaching people to submit to all kinds of oppression, including religious oppression.</p>
<p>Some of the most oppressed and subjugated people in the world are religious people. There are churches and Christian colleges that are every bit as tyrannical as anything coming out of East-bloc or Muslim countries. About the only thing missing is physical torture and execution. Spiritually, however, the oppression is the same.</p>
<p>How could real men who love the liberty they have in Christ allow themselves&#8211;and especially their wives&#8211;to be told how to dress, how to wear their hair, what kind of music to listen to, what kind of vacations to take, what restaurants they may or may not eat at, what forms of entertainment they may or may not participate in, etc., etc., ad infinitum?</p>
<p>I tell you the truth: many Christians in America are already slaves. To talk to them about freedom is a complete waste of time. The chains of tyranny are already clamped around their hearts. Why should it matter to them if chains are clamped around their necks? When they talk about “defending the faith,” they are talking about defending the institution. They are slaves to the institution. And the same is true for many unchurched Americans.</p>
<p>What is more important: liberty, or the government that is supposed to secure liberty? To a sizeable number of Americans today, it is more important to preserve the institution than the freedoms that the institution was created to protect.</p>
<p>Our Declaration of Independence states, “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends [the God-given rights of life, liberty, etc.], it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”</p>
<p>Did you see that: “any form of government”? ANY FORM. The form of government is only as good as its ability to secure liberty.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of politicians and media personalities talking about “American exceptionalism.” This is a potentially dangerous mindset. If one means that America is exceptional in our history and the manner in which our Constitution and Bill of Rights were established to protect liberty, well and good. But if it means that America has carte-blanche to do anything it wants&#8211;no matter how unconstitutional or tyrannical&#8211;because it is “exceptional,” it is a bunch of hooey.</p>
<p>What difference does it make if we have a 50-State Union or not? There is a bill in the California legislature that would divide that State into six states. Five counties in Western Maryland are trying to secede from Baltimore. Ten northern counties in Colorado are trying to secede from Denver. If a State refuses to secure the liberties of the people of that State, they have every right under God to separate. The State is not nearly as important as the liberties of the people within the State.</p>
<p>The spirit of secession is actually growing like wildfire all over the world. In recent history, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Kosovo all separated from Yugoslavia. Transnistria broke free from Moldova. Abkhazia and South Ossetia fought free from Georgia. The Slovaks seceded from Czechoslovakia. And now Crimea is separating from Ukraine.</p>
<p>To be sure, not every country that secedes from another country is motivated purely by the love of liberty. But for those of us in America, the issue that has propelled the desire to separate from one country or one State has always been liberty. It was the love of liberty that created the United States and that created the free and independent states of Maine, Vermont, Kentucky, and West Virginia&#8211;all of which seceded from existing U.S. states.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what difference does it make if Washington, D.C., is our federal capital, or, if say, Helena, Montana, would become the federal capital of a mountain state confederation of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Northern Colorado, eastern Washington and Oregon, the Dakotas, Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, and Alaska? Or if Austin was the federal capital of an independent Republic of Texas? Preserving some sort of political union (especially if it is a forced and coerced union) is not nearly as important as preserving liberty.</p>
<p>Again, it is not the political institution that is important. What is important is the liberty that the political institution is supposed to secure.</p>
<p>Many great minds in this country are already philosophizing over the possibility that secession is an idea whose time has come&#8211;again. A few years ago, Walter Williams wrote, “Like a marriage that has gone bad, I believe there are enough irreconcilable differences between those who want to control and those want to be left alone that divorce is the only peaceable alternative. Just as in a marriage, where vows are broken, our human rights protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution have been grossly violated by a government instituted to protect them. Americans who are responsible for and support constitutional abrogation have no intention of mending their ways.</p>
<p>“Americans who wish to live free have two options: We can resist, fight and risk bloodshed to force America&#8217;s tyrants to respect our liberties and human rights, or we can seek a peaceful resolution of our irreconcilable differences by separating. That can be done by peopling several states, say Texas and Louisiana, control their legislatures and then issue a unilateral declaration of independence just as the Founders did in 1776. You say, ‘Williams, nobody has to go that far, just get involved in the political process and vote for the right person.’ That&#8217;s nonsense. Liberty shouldn&#8217;t require a vote. It&#8217;s a God-given or natural right.</p>
<p>“Some independence or secessionists movements, such as our 1776 war with England and our 1861 War Between the States, have been violent, but they need not be. In 1905, Norway seceded from Sweden, Panama seceded from Columbia (1903), and West Virginia from Virginia (1863). Nonetheless, violent secession can lead to great friendships. England is probably our greatest ally and we have fought three major wars together. There is no reason why Texiana (Texas and Louisiana) couldn&#8217;t peaceably secede, be an ally, and have strong economic ties with United States.</p>
<p>“The bottom line question for all of us is should we part company or continue trying to forcibly impose our wills on one another?”</p>
<p>See William’s column here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchuckbaldwinlive.com%2FArticles%2Ftabid%2F109%2FID%2F1149%2FInstitutionalized-Tyranny.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1RS7GDjYF35eP0TqKh9wrKVsJJA" target="_blank">It&#8217;s Time To Part Company</a></p>
<p>Hear! Hear!</p>
<p>In the eyes of God, marriage is the most sacred of all unions. It is far more sacred than any political union. If our Creator has authorized the separation of a husband and wife under certain circumstances in which one party violated the sacred terms of the holy contract (and He has), who among us has the audacity to say that political unions may not be abandoned when government commits political adultery by forsaking its oath to the people?</p>
<p>Again, are we more interested in preserving an institution or the liberty that the institution is supposed to secure?</p>
<p>As an institution, the Church at large is apostate. Yet, millions of Christians continue to prop up an institution that has abandoned the purpose for which it was created. They are more interested in preserving the forms and liturgies and tapestries and buildings of the institution. And, all the while, they are being spiritually enslaved by the very institution they are helping to prop up.</p>
<p>And as an institution, the U.S. federal government is apostate. Yet, millions of citizens continue to make excuses for it, justify it, and condone it. They are more interested in preserving the agencies and entities and power of the institution. Yet, all the while, they are being enslaved by the very institution they are helping to prop up.</p>
<p>What happens when an institution becomes more important than the cause for which the institution was formed? When the institution is civil government and the cause is liberty, tyranny is what happens.</p>

			<p><strong>Christians React&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/americas-judgment3.jpg" /></p>

<p>It is possible that like ancient Judah, the United States is destined to come under despotic rule.  Though we do not have Jeremiah to keep us informed (Jeremiah 27) it appears that the wheels of destiny are carrying us in that direction.  It could be that world tyranny is God’s plan for the ultimate advance of His Kingdom.  Our time is temporal while God’s time is eternal.</p>
<p>Jeremiah warned the people of Judah not to resist the Babylonians that it was God’s judgment that caused their captivity and when they resisted they were resisting God.</p>
<p>Recently, a theologically sound Christian brother graciously explained to me why it is evil to “take to the streets” in protest against tyrannical government.</p>
<p>He wrote that God raises up pagan rulers to shame us into repentance and if we repent He raises up Godly rulers.  If a nation fails to repent God keeps it under tyrannical rule or destroys it.  Remedial action involves going to the lesser magistrates – councilmen to mayors, mayors to governors to presidents, etc. &#8211; and thinks taking to the streets is “resisting the ordinance” of God.</p>
<p>He further contends that today’s Christian church is not nearly as bad as it was in the days of Martin Luther and that we should “diplomatically and with love and care” approach church officers to explain our concerns.  If this does not work he believes God will abandon us and raise up another civilization.</p>
<p>When revolutions are successful in overthrowing evil and oppressive regimes, the evil and repressive regime is often replaced by another violent, evil, and repressive regime.  Governments, even evil governments, serve purposes that are necessary to the functioning of society.  In our time the devastating results of revolution are evident in Libya, Syria, and now in the Ukraine. <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2014/02/21/before-and-after-pictures-of-kievs-independence-square-capture-battle-in-ukraine-4313179/" target="_blank">See here</a>.</p>
<p>Revolutionary anarchism seldom produces a superior form of government.  It is often fomented by forces that intend to <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/03/06/looting-ukraine-begun/" target="_blank">impose their own rule</a> on the chaos that results.</p>
<p>In over fifty years of my Christian walk I have approached several ministers with suggestions on improving fidelity to the Will of God.  I have yet to find an ordained minister who will consider suggestions for improvement.  The status of lay persons prevents them from becoming a source of correction.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._W._Tozer" target="_blank">A.W. Tozer</a><a name="0.1__GoBack"></a>, a self-educated Christian minister, described the situation well in his 1955 book “The Root of Righteousness”:  “Churches and Christian organizations have shown a tendency to fall into the same error that destroyed Israel: inability to receive admonition.  After a time of growth and successful labor comes the deadly psychology of self-congratulation.  Success itself becomes the cause of later failure.  The leaders come to accept themselves as the very chosen of God.  They are special objects of divine favor; their success is proof enough that this is so.  They must therefore be right, and anyone who tries to call them to account is instantly written off as an unauthorized meddler who should be ashamed to dare to reprove his betters.”</p>
<p>“If anyone imagines that we are merely playing with words let him approach at random any religious leader and call attention to the weaknesses and sins in his organization.  Such a one will be sure to get the quick brush off, and if he dares to persist he will be confronted with reports and statistics to prove that he is dead wrong and completely out of order.  ‘We be the seed of Abraham’ will be the burden of the defense.  And who would dare find fault with Abraham’s seed?”</p>
<p>Tozer’s description of the plight of the clerisy (1955) seems to verify the condition of the contemporary Christian Church for a period longer than the forty year ministry of Jeremiah.  Attempts, gracious or otherwise, to change church leaders have failed. My experience matches Tozer’s description.</p>
<p>I am afraid we are long past the time when attempting to reach leaders by starting with lessor magistrates can be used as an orderly and effective redemptive procedure.  In his penetrating book “The Soul of the American University” George Marsden chronicles the secularization of our Christian schools of higher learning.  In 1805 Harvard University, initially a Christian institution, elected Henry Ware, a Unitarian, as Hollis Professor of Divinity.  The deterioration of the United States social order began in earnest over two centuries ago.</p>
<p>A perfunctory confrontation to the secularization of higher education took the form of alternative colleges.   In 1808 Andover Theological Seminary was founded and dedicated by charter to be forever committed to orthodox Calvinism.  Yale was founded as an alternative to Harvard.  Slowly all of these institutions succumbed to the popular demand for a secular education.</p>
<p>Men are sinners and the urge to usurp God’s sovereignty is steady and strong.  Antinomianism and Arminianism have been chipping away at sound Christian doctrine since settlers landed on the shores of North America.  The sound doctrines carried to the new world by the Pilgrims and Puritans were resisted by some and challenged by others.  John Wesley’s Methodists brought the heresies of Jacob Arminius and spread them throughout the colonies; Baptists and Congregationalists granted autonomy to individual congregations while Quakers, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Moravians, Catholics and Jews set up churches.  Continuity of Protestant doctrine was lost very early in American history.</p>
<p>Arminianism found fertile ground but it was the scourge of Dispensationalism that effectively declawed the Lion of Judah.  Removing Law from the Christian religion is like removing the heart from a human; it is the core of Christianity.  R. J. Rushdoony claims that those who hate The Law hate God.   The Law reveals the character of the God of the Bible.  When Christian theologians teach free-will they rob God of sovereignty and a god who is not sovereign is not really God at all.  Denominations that teach these two destructive “A”s are really foreign religions.</p>
<p>America has a secular government and its citizens have a secular mindset.  Humanism has invaded our churches.  God’s Law is so far from the thinking of most modern citizens that they consider stoning a guilty individual for breaking a mandate from the Creator of the Universe worse than using weapons of modern warfare to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings all created in God’s image.  The hysterical fear of Sharia law is a reflection of the appraisal of God’s Law.  Fear has fostered unreasonable opinions that have distorted truth and contributed to the detachment from reality that is common in our culture.  We are far down the road from obedience to the God of the Bible.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church of Luther’s day had usurped the use of the sword and sentenced heretics to death.  It was, however, a visible evil that could be confronted as a single entity.  Today, we are faced with scores of more subtle enemies.  The landscape is covered with the dead bodies of religious organizations whose ghosts are still active but useless.</p>
<p>The sad, preplanned deterioration of the United States of America has never been effectively confronted with the true Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Luther confronted the Catholic Church directly forcing decisive action and the Reformation went on to confront the ruling class with the status of God’s Law teaching the people that both they and their rulers are subject to the higher legal standards imposed by The Creator.</p>
<p>Will God discard the United States of America and work with another civilization?  Maybe, but considering that God sent Jonah to Nineveh to announce judgment and then caused the hearts of the people to repent making a liar out of a reluctant Jonah, we need to understand that His actions cannot always be predicted.  God will determine the fate of our nation.  It appears impossible from a human appraisal but prayer and confrontation have accomplished miracles and there is still hope for the miraculous.</p>
<p>Christians are vested with the responsibility of confronted evil with righteousness.  Strident confrontations of sinful behavior properly express the Will of God and should be part of our resistance.  Our God is not a pantywaist. We are to avoid chaos and anarchy but we are to be active in promoting the Kingdom of God against the pervasive kingdom of man.</p>
<p>Without a modern Jeremiah God’s directions must be conveyed through His Word.  Public platforms for the dissemination of information are closely controlled and Christians are not allowed.  The streets may be the only venue available for voicing true Christianity; don’t worry though, there a few Christians willing to take on such a responsibility.</p>
<p>My Christian friend who took issue with “taking to the streets” uses the word “ethics” in reference to “God’s Law”.  He maintains that the meanings are the same.  I believe he is wrong.  Ethics is less offensive and is often used as a secular term whereas God’s Law is specific.  Pulling punches may quell conflict but it is dishonest and breaches God’s injunction to let our yeas be yea and our nays be nay.  R. J. Rushdoony writes, “A true church can suffer in battle, because it confronts the enemy; a false church refuses to battle, because it is at peace with sin and death, and does not know Jesus Christ as Lord.”</p>
<p>There is a time for war and a time for peace.  Christians are losing the war because they refuse to suffer!</p>
<p>I cannot end this essay without including a quote for Rushdoony’s Second Volume of Systematic Theology (Page 967).  This quote describes perfectly our condition and its remedy:</p>
<p>“We are then told, first, that for faithfulness to God’s law, man will be blessed in the weather, the land, and in it harvests (Lev.26:3-5).  Second, there shall be peace, i.e., no danger from enemies external and internal.  This peace goes hand in hand with victory (Lev. 26:6-8).  Third, there will be fruitfulness, i.e., many children, because God’s covenant peace is with them.  They will also have fruitful harvests and an abundance of food (Lev. 26:9-10).  Fourth, God shall dwell among His people to keep them in safety (Lev. 26 11-13.  Fifth, If they are disobedient or faithless, God will curse them.  Terror, plagues, enemies, and more will pursue them, and they will see depopulation (Lev. 26:14-26).  Famine will take its toll.  Sixth, in their continued apostasy, they will be pushed into cannibalism and more.  The Lord will destroy their cities, and their land will be made a desolation.  They will be taken into captivity also.  All this will allow the land to enjoy its Sabbaths as they go into captivity (Lev. 26:27-43.  Seventh, in all of this, God will seek their restoration.  His judgments will be covenant judgments, seeking their return to the law and the covenant (Lev. 26:44-46)”</p>

<p><i>Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.</i> ~ Eph 5:11</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the movie “Son of God” has created quite a stir in the Christian community.  Before I gave the theater my money I read several reviews, blog posts, Facebook comments and viewed TV interviews of husband and wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey promoting their film.  Roma is a familiar face to many and is best-known for her role on the successful TV show “Touched by An Angel.”  Mark Burnett is the executive producer of a string of hit TV shows such as &#8220;Survivor,&#8221; &#8220;The Voice, “Celebrity Apprentice,&#8221; &#8220;Shark Tank,&#8221; and he has won several Emmys.</p>
<p>When I first heard that another full-length feature film about the life of Christ was coming to the silver screen, I was skeptical for several reasons.  First, Mark and Roma are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fproclaimingthegospel.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFC3frvRKIQF9SC4yqvYBlZF-DJFw" target="_blank">Catholic</a> and I was concerned that the movie would be produced from this perspective; a perspective that in many cases I disagree with.</p>
<p>Second, I learned that Roma earned a degree in “spiritual psychology” from the University of Santa Monica, a private graduate school founded by New Age spiritual and self-help quack John-Roger.   P.J. Miller is not being flippant when he asks:</p>
<p><i>What do you call someone who is a student of new age psychology and spiritualism? Do you call them new agers? Do you call them seekers? Would you dare call them Christian? Well, if you’re Roma Downey, then yes, you would call yourself all the above. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpjmiller.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F02%2F20%2Froma-downey-and-mark-burnetts-son-of-god-film%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgZWzUvSSuonF-KhRyFE76zVKmtg" target="_blank">Source</a>)</i></p>
<p>Third, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcIXCok9HPg" target="_blank">movie trailer</a> shows Jesus asking Peter to follow Him. Peter looks skeptical and asks Jesus what they’re going to do.  Jesus grins and replies “Change the world.&#8221;  Well, no.  Jesus never said those words to Peter!  Here’s what Jesus actually said:</p>
<p><i>While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</i><i> And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”<sup><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></sup>Immediately they left their nets and followed him. </i>(Mat 4:18-20)</p>
<p>Jesus <i>commanded</i>  &#8211; Peter and Andrew dropped what they were doing to follow Him.  (More on this in a moment.)  Another clip shows a woman sitting in a boat on the Sea of Galilee with Jesus and the apostles during the storm where Jesus walks on water.  But according to Scripture there was no woman in the boat:</p>
<p><i>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.  </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F14.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQMifrWgBs3o8e0MX5YlB1nLJO6g" target="_blank">Mat 14:22</a>) <i></i></p>
<p>In the movie Mary was the woman in the boat.  But why would they have a woman in the boat when Matthew informs us that the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Ftwelve-apostles-disciples-12.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHKds39cg97GDWLIkhPjBmgEvhiw" target="_blank">disciples/apostles</a> got into the boat.  Mary wasn’t one of the twelve disciples/apostles – no woman was!</p>
<p>Finally, S. Michael Houdmann revealed in his review of the movie that, “the reason for Jesus&#8217; death and the meaning of His resurrection are completely missing. The fact that Jesus&#8217; death is the atoning sacrifice for sin is not mentioned at all (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2F1%2520John%25202.2&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG905IHhqX4ANXW8h2rFEl3ybcB-A" target="_blank">1 John 2:2</a>).”</p>
<p>As I said, “Son of God” has elicited a great deal of controversy as did Mark and Roma’s “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.com%2Fshows%2Fthe-bible%2Fvideos%3Fmkwid%3DsSPL82MEx%257Cc_pcrid_38422039518_pkw_the%2520bible%2520miniseries_pmt_b%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_term%3Dthe%2520bible%2520miniseries%26utm_campaign%3DG_The%2BBible%26paidlink%3D1%26cmpid%3DPaidSearch_google_G_The%2BBible_&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFELoDt1jPlNQ5AsvmarGeUJWHSSA" target="_blank">The Bible</a>” miniseries produced by <i>LightWorkers Media</i>, a company owned by them. This “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunnyshell.org%2F2013%2F03%2Fhistory-channels-bible-exalts-man-over_4.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNENGZsv0GJfi2VStlvgqd5IX4qefA" target="_blank">heretical and blasphemous</a>” program aired on the History Channel last year. &#8220;We knew when we were shooting,” said Downey, “that the Jesus portion of our &#8216;Bible&#8217; series was special and we shot much more footage and we&#8217;ve re-edited many more scenes into a stand-alone feature film called &#8216;Son of God.&#8217;&#8221;   I don’t have the space to tackle the “The Bible” brouhaha.  I will say, though, that several highly controversial pastors sat on the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbibleseriesresources.com%2Fboard-of-advisors&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF58IDJY5UUlo7Sr0ZN7tr0PkvRnQ" target="_blank">Board of Advisors</a>.

<p><b>The Son of God?</b></p>
<p>“Son of God” opened on February 28, so by now a lot of folks have had the opportunity to view it in theatres and many more will have it streaming into their living rooms in a few months.  Naturally, reviews were quickly written, some good, some not so good.  (You’ll find links to the reviews at the end of this piece.) Suffice to say that in a short amount of time a lot has been said about the film.</p>
<p>Many of you won’t be surprised to learn that Mark and Roma asked Saddleback Church founder Rick Warren to help spread their version of the “good news.”   He happily agreed.  “I&#8217;ve seen most of the films produced about Jesus in the past 50 years,” said the pastor, “and ‘Son of God’ is the best.  We&#8217;re excited Jesus is back on the big screen, and we&#8217;re going to fill the theaters. I want every other faith leader in America to do the same.”</p>
<p>So – why would the man who is affectionately called “America’s Pastor” agree to promote a film that its critics describe as outright unbiblical?</p>
<p>Not only did Warren endorse the film, according to the <em>Baptist Standard</em> staff report :</p>
<p>Pastor and author Rick Warren partnered with LifeWay Christian Resources to release a Bible study related to the <em>Son of God</em> movie from 20th Century Fox, which hits theaters Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The small-group curriculum resource by Warren, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifeway.com%2FProduct%2Fson-of-god-the-life-of-jesus-in-you-leader-kit-p005683781&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcgHScltwfKoVSrmkrNSALmULXSA" target="_blank"><em>Son of God: The Life of Jesus in You</em></a>, is a companion piece to the movie produced by husband-and-wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey.</p>
<p>The six-session study features video clips from the movie and videos from Warren explaining Jesus’ teachings and their impact on people’s lives. Topics include baptism, temptation, suffering, death, resurrection and ministry. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.baptiststandard.com%2Fnews%2Fbaptist%2F16135-baptist-briefs-son-of-god-film-study-materials&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe5Hn8F-yRqcWl1o5LUyhycE_kmA" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>As a Southern Baptist preacher, Rick Warren knows perfectly well that the Roman Catholic Church holds to the view that it is the one true Church.  Thus, any church outside the RCC is anathematized (excommunicated, cursed or damned). The Protestant Reformers held the view that the RCC’s gospel is not a gospel that saves; therefore the RCC is apostate.  Anyone who rejects the true gospel – we are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone – is an unbeliever.  Period.  Warren also knows what the Bible teaches regarding believers going into <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F110124&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiF_q_2AwTLQ4sDLs1yW7u9WlT7Q" target="_blank">partnerships with unbelievers</a>:</p>
<p><i>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMAY0VmYFOOkoqEQo2lwys2YH5dQ" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>)</p>
<p>Here’s the thing.  Not everyone who professes the name of Christ has a true saving faith.  What about Mark Burnett and Roma Downey?  Do they have a true saving faith?  Let’s examine the fruit.</p>
<p><b>Endorsements</b></p>
<p>Popular pastor and author Mark Driscoll’s church bought out 3,500 seats.  In 2013 he and his wife shared a stage with Mark and Roma at Resurgence 13.  Driscoll later remarked:</p>
<p><i>We watched the world premier trailer for</i><em> </em><i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonofgodmovie.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-fkG9dZ52XXs5GpGYJ54MvuRECQ" target="_blank">The Son of God</a> at the conference, and the footage choked me up as I thought of the millions of people who will hear about Jesus through this project. I am so encouraged by God’s work through this couple. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftheresurgence.com%2F2013%2F11%2F07%2Fson-of-god-mark-burnett-roma-downey-at-r13&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5IaLbzfvROoRWgJK81bKNGWfuYA" target="_blank">Source</a>)<i></i></p>
<p>God’s work?</p>
<p><i>The connection between the Passover sacrifice (Exodus 12) and Jesus as the Lamb of God (</i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2FJohn%25201.29&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNETeolXbTfLhDRdYfRa0yM6E5HHPQ" target="_blank"><i>John 1:29</i></a><i>) is not made. The fact that Jesus&#8217; resurrection proves His victory over death and sin and guarantees a resurrected eternal life for all who believe in Him (1 Corinthians 15) is nowhere to be found.  &#8211; </i>S. Michael Houdmann</p>
<p>Another endorser of the film was “Social Justice Christian” Rev. Jim Wallis.  In my column <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120911&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIE-sMLkZMpVsz_lvVUBF_fHl0fA" target="_blank">Liberalism created the culture of evil and death, part 3</a> I wrote:</p>
<p><i>This man wears many hats.  He is the founder of Sojourner’s Magazine, speaker, author and activist.  He’s also President Obama’s “spiritual advisor.”  This alone speaks volumes.  Rev. Wallis insists that he’s an evangelical Christian even though he has abandoned the biblical gospel for the “social gospel.”  He believes he’s on a mission from God to assist the poor and oppressed to bring forth the Kingdom of God on earth. </i></p>
<p>When this purveyor of the false social justice gospel was asked for advice by the couple, he gladly gave it to them:</p>
<p><i>What won me over to the whole series was the clip about Jesus meeting Peter, the fisherman. In a Washington, D.C., premiere of “The Bible” series a few weeks ago, I had wonderful conversations with Mark and Roma. Mark asked me if they were right to have Jesus say that he wanted to change the world. Those words are not literally in the scriptures, but it seemed to him and Roma that’s exactly what Jesus was talking about. Absolutely correct, I told them both. And we went through the first few chapters of Mathew which demonstrate that truth. I love the clarity and courage of the statement from Jesus in “The Bible.”</i></p>
<p>Sunny Shell disagrees:</p>
<p><i>Christ came into the world to save sinners from the righteous wrath of God, which is the just penalty for our sins. He never said He came to change the world.

<p><strong><i>Joel Osteen</i></strong><i>, pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Tex., who is distributing 8,000 tickets donated by an anonymous donor; <strong>Jerry Falwell</strong>, Jr., of Liberty University which has more than 12,000 students; <strong>Craig Groeschel</strong> of LifeChurch which has 18 campuses in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles with over four million members and Miles McPherson of the Rock Church with weekly attendance of more than 10,000 in San Diego, Calif.</i> (Emphasis in original - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.examiner.com%2Farticle%2Frick-warren-son-of-god-best-movie-of-jesus-50-years&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFU_NyUVASLjKJekDa5tfeSfhWwKw" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>In an article that appeared on <i>Fox News</i>, Mark and Roma wrote:</p>
<p><i>In all our combined years in the entertainment industry, we’ve never seen anything like this kind of grass-roots support for a project. It is truly miraculous.</i></p>
<p><i>So, too, is the unprecedented depth and breadth of those who have endorsed the film. Pastors like Rick, as well as scholars and faith organizations, have graciously supported our effort to share this story of our Savior – though they belong to different denominations, adhere to varying theological doctrine, worship God in their own unique ways. </i></p>
<p><i>Bishop T.D. Jakes of The Potter’s House in Dallas said “the audience will be enthralled, encouraged and inspired.” </i></p>
<p>S. Michael Houdmann was not enthralled by the movie.  In his review he writes:</p>
<p><i>The Son of God presents a Jewish Messiah who is crucified, dies, comes back to life, and commissions His followers to spread the word. But why did He have to die? What is the meaning of the resurrection? What is the message the apostles were supposed to proclaim, and why was it worth dying for? <b></b></i></p>
<p>More from the <i>Fox News</i> article…</p>
<p><i>Joel Osteen of Lakewood Church in Houston called it “an epic work that touches the heart.”</i></p>
<p><i>The Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles Jose Gomez says it’s “a very important movie because it gives us the opportunity to realize God’s presence in our own lives.”</i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fopinion%2F2014%2F02%2F27%2Fson-god-miraculous-journey-to-big-screen%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-smuaswla4b1ygxCikRAo3i46Xw" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Certainly there are by now “Church leaders” that are sincerely shocked to find out that they endorsed a movie produced by New Age Catholics.  Here’s more proof from a 2010 article <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbecksmithhollywood.com%2F2009%2F04%2Froma-downey-happy-out-of-spotlight%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_oBUaRK962PgJULO81uMLpLoLuw" target="_blank">Roma Downey Happy Out of the Spotlight</a> that shows she’s an advocate of New Age/New Thought spirituality:</p>
<p><i>Says Roma, who lives in Malibu, ‘My kids go to school about a 40-minute drive away. I’m open to the group’s opinion about what we listen to on the way there. On the way back, I get my own selections — books on tape by Eckhart Tolle, Tony Robbins…My husband says I’m so self-realized I’m practically levitating.’</i></p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with Eckhart Tolle, he’s a New Ager.  A few years ago Tolle paired up with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120507&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExBXarCqOHwN2-lSGzbTk6euqV8A" target="_blank">Oprah Winfrey</a> to do 10 online classes on XM Satellite radio on his blockbuster book “A New Earth: Are You Ready to Be Awakened.”  Oprah and Tolle took participants through his book chapter by chapter.  Regrettably, a large number of professing Christians took the class!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christiananswersforthenewage.org%2FArticles_HumanPotential1.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-F3ncTQ4AYRlwb3R9_5522XPqIg" target="_blank">Human Potential</a> guru and &#8220;coach for success” Anthony Robbins once said: &#8220;My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel tons of pleasure and very little pain.&#8221;  Evidently no pain is experienced after completing a barefoot firewalk, a self-empower technique Robbins’ teaches to get an otherwise sane person to walk on a bed of burning hot coals during his “Unleash The Power Within” seminar.  On this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od-bcLqelnY#t=11" target="_blank">video</a> you’ll hear the sound of drums beating and the crowd chanting “YES! YES! YES!” as Robbinswhips them into a frenzy in preparation for the firewalk.</p>
<p>More…</p>
<p>Roma appeared on “psychic medium” <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F080328&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoEPHJhGb6qyChcEUmyIZoszlzew" target="_blank">John Edward’s</a> TV show and allegedly spoke to her deceased mother.  What does the Bible have to say about consulting a medium?</p>
<p><i>And he burned his son as an offering and used fortune-telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_kings%2F21.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbHPjPuA6cdkYAYbK5InRfolex4Q" target="_blank">2 Kings 21:6</a>)</p>
<p>Well, it’s apparent that Roma, who says she loves the Bible, is unaware—or doesn’t care&#8211;that God says consulting a medium is evil.</p>
<p>Later she collaborated with Edwards by providing a CD to accompany a book he wrote:</p>
<p><i>Roma prays the entire rosary</i><i> on the beautiful CD that comes along with this book. It’s quite lovely and gives you the special opportunity and a unique spiritual closeness to Roma to be able to pray right along with her as if she was right there at your side.”</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdavemosher.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F03%2F06%2Froma-downeys-comments-and-connections-with-psychic-medium-john-edward-show-she-is-not-a-christian-as-she-claims-but-a-new-ager%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFvRX_2PmQgJ6HjxzeL4MTWIkJ4Q" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>So now you know a bit about two New Age gurus Roma Downey looks forward to listening to each day and an occultist she collaborated with.  The worldview of these men is as far from Christianity as the Earth is from Pluto.</p>
<p>P.J. Miller sat listening to Jim Bakker introduce Mark and Roma on Bakker’s TV show and recalled “their previous work on the History Channel’s The Bible and how they managed to literally re-write the Bible itself, and presented another gospel message altogether. I was captured by their … aggressive but subtle attempt to portray themselves as ‘believers’.  The sappy spiritual love fest that permeated on set showed me that something was indeed changing within Christianity, and that something was another Jesus being introduced to the masses.”</p>
<p><i>Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.</i><i> For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAUYRr8l_vl0ukuYfMAByj5ZPIRw" target="_blank">Mat/ 24: 23-24</a>)</p>
<p>After several weeks of due diligence I’ve decided that “Son of God” is not a film I wish to see.  In addition to the concerns I have included in this article, my research has turned up many more &#8212; way too many to incorporate here.  Most troubling is the astonishing lack of discernment shown by some of our so-called Christian leaders.  The Son of God I serve is best described in the Bible which is the inerrant, infallible, inspired Word of God.  Inspired means that God moved through the writers to convey to those who read it the words He wanted us to hear.  So to change the words that Christ spoke is prideful and wicked.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that those who are unfamiliar with the biblical Jesus and see this film will not come away with a clear understanding of His mission here on Earth.</p>
<p><i>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_john%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFadypSTjyThkBi-zCJpgrDYPqWQg" target="_blank">1John 2:2</a>)<i></i></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us.  Hereby know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.&#8221; </i>(1 John 4:6)</p>
<p>In this verse the emphasis is on the believer&#8217;s ability to discern between a spirit of truth and a spirit of error, heresy, apostasy, lies and cleverly disguised deceptions such as modern evolutionary thinking and methodological naturalism.</p>
<p>The spirit of truth is relatively easy to discern as such people come willingly to the light of truth (John 3:21).  Having a heart for truth, they really and truly want to know and embrace Truth.  On the other hand, the spirit of error is more difficult to discern because the taproot and energy of this spirit is in Satan, the father of lies, of false gods, cleverness, sophistry, false science and evolution, heresy, apostasy, rebellion, murder, and envy.</p>
<p>Satan is the great deceiver (Rev. 12:9).  He uses his servants of deception to manipulate, confuse, and mislead (Ephesians 4:14).   Today his most powerfully influential servants are the world&#8217;s occult &#8216;elites&#8217; but are also found throughout the secular, Christian, cult and occult New Age arenas. (2 Cor. 11:14-15)</p>
<p>One of Satan&#8217;s important servants, the evangelical apostate Alice Bailey (1880-1949), is a major architect of today&#8217;s rapidly spreading serpent-powered occult New Age movement, a spiritual juggernaut effecting a counter-conversion of consciousness that closes the soul to Jesus Christ while opening it to powers of darkness.</p>
<p>According to Bailey&#8217;s contemporary apostles, the &#8216;Plan&#8217; telepathically revealed to Bailey for the coming New Age can be traced back to the fall of Lucifer and his angels from heaven. Bailey&#8217;s demon-master, the Tibetan, described the revolt of the angels against the Holy God as part of the<i>&#8220;divine plan of evolution</i>,&#8221; by which angels &#8220;<i>descended from their sinless and free state of existence in order to develop full divine awareness on earth</i>.&#8221;  (Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future, Fr. Seraphim Rose, p. 224)</p>
<p>In this total reversal and inversion of the Revealed Word of God, the Fall of man was really an evolutionary ascent to liberating knowledge by which man&#8217;s eyes were opened to good (Satan) and evil (the Holy God).  Thus Helena Blavatsky, another important servant of Satan and architect of New Age spirituality concluded that it is but natural,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<i>to view Satan, the Serpent of Genesis, as the real creator and benefactor, the Father of Spiritual mankind.  For it was he who was the &#8216;Harbinger of Light,&#8217; bright radiant Lucifer, who opened the eyes of the automaton created by Jehovah&#8230;Indeed, (mankind) was taught wisdom and the hidden knowledge by the &#8216;Fallen Angel.&#8221;   As man&#8217;s benefactor, Lucifer continues to assist man&#8217;s evolution.   In the words of the apostate evangelical, now New Age theologian David Spangler, a disciple of both Blavatsky and Bailey, Lucifer is &#8216;the angel of man&#8217;s evolution.&#8221;</i>  (ibid, pp. 224-225)</p>
<p>From the time of the Apostles of Jesus Christ to our own day, an unbroken chain of Satan&#8217;s servants have disguised themselves as super apostles and ministers of righteousness who as always are,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the <i>inventors of impure heresies</i> (the) <i>profaners and apostates </i>(who open)<i> their mouths wide against the divine glory&#8221;. .</i>..Church Father Cyril of Alexandria</p>
<p>These spirits hate Truth and most generally elevate themselves among God&#8217;s family so as to lead believers into compromise and conformity with the pagan world system.</p>
<p>On behalf of what Satan&#8217;s contemporary ministers term &#8216;rational&#8217; and &#8216;scientific&#8217; they sweep away the essentials of the faith necessary both for salvation and the recognition of evil. (2 Peter 2:18) And without the grace and spiritual discernment that is born of true faith, Satan ceases to exist in the eyes of the spiritually blind, whether secular or Christian.</p>
<p>Commenting on the incredible blindness of our scientifically enlightened, theologically compromised and apostate modern society, the cultural theorist Denis de Rougemont (1906-1985), author of &#8220;<i>The Devil&#8217;s Share, An Essay on the Diabolic in Modern Society</i>&#8221; observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What appears to me incredible is not the Devil, not the Angels, but rather the candor and the credulity of the skeptic, and the unpardonable sophism of which they show themselves to be the victims </i>(they say) <i>&#8216;The Devil is a gent with red horns and a long tail; now I cannot believe in a gent with red horns and a long tail; therefore I don&#8217;t believe in the Devil.&#8217;  And so the Devil has them precisely where he wants them.&#8221; (</i>The Coming Darkness, John Ankerberg and John Weldon, p. 61)</p>
<p>When believers find spiritual Truth trivialized and diminished, marginalized and ridiculed in the church, some will go in search of a faithful church, some will fall away entirely, and others will turn to cults and the occult.</p>
<p>Tragically, since Satan&#8217;s ministers ridicule and reject the authority of God&#8217;s Word, the second and third groups have no guidelines for evaluating and testing the occult/Eastern spiritual experiences and devices they encounter such as the Enneagram, Jungian psychology, the MBTI, kundalini yoga, and meditation techniques already popular in our culture, apostatizing churches and steadily creeping into compromised churches.  Thus they can easily stumble into the spirit world and if not already fallen away, then onto the broad smooth way of apostasy:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..<i>acceptance of the enneagram, if not already a sign of apostasy, must lead to a loss of faith since it distorts the Gospel and contradicts Catholic doctrine, depriving the individual of a genuine Catholic language and setting in its place what has been most aptly termed as psychobabbling. What is most puzzling, however, is the continued silence of the Church&#8217;s official teachers who know that this absurdity is being promoted and spread among our Catholic school teachers and priests.&#8221;  </i>(NCCB Preparing Cautionary Note on Use of Enneagram, Paul Likoudis, Catholic Culture.org)</p>
<p>For an eye-opening look at the demon-oppressed Carl Jung and a penetrating analysis of his occult, alchemical, Gnostic, and demon-informed psychology and connections to the wildly popular Enneagram and MBTI, read &#8220;<i>Carl Jung, Neo-Gnosticism, &amp; the MBTI,&#8221; </i>by Rev. Ed Hird, past National Chair of Anglican Renewal Ministries of Canada:  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww3.telus.net%2Fst_simons%2Farm03.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5uB22HhtE-d5X75UY31qAQz74sg" target="_blank">http://www3.telus.net/st_<wbr></wbr>simons/arm03.htm</a></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&#8221; </i>1 John 4:1</p>
<p>In his best-selling book &#8220;<i>Strange Fire</i>,&#8221; Pastor John MacArthur masterfully chronicles the unsavory history underpinning the modern Charismatic/Apostolic Movement (NAR) and its false prophets.  The New Apostolic Reformation is both a breeding ground for scandal, bad doctrine, and spiritual chicanery and the fastest growing &#8220;Christian&#8221; movement in the world.  MacArthur lays out a chilling case for rejecting its false prophets and for exposing their errors to the cleansing light of Truth.</p>
<p>In his own penetrating analysis of the Charismatic/Apostolic movement, Fr. Seraphim Rose notes that the spiritist manifestations (i.e., impartation, holy laughter, drunk in the spirit, roaring, barking, hissing, slain in the spirit) experienced in Charismatic churches are found in the occult New Age movement.   The spirit that invaded the Charismatic movement during the &#8216;Toronto Blessing&#8217; is not the Holy Spirit, said Rose, but the kundalini spirit (serpent power), the same spirit that ancient Egyptians, Hindus, yoga practitioners, and New Agers are familiar with.</p>
<p>From the time of the ancients serpent power has been important to religious and mythological symbolism all around the world. Within the Egyptian mysteries, serpent power was associated with,</p>
<p>&#8230;<i>&#8220;the elemental forces that were in play before the creation of the world</i>.&#8221; (Carl Teichrib, <i>Gods of Ancient Egypt</i>, p. 182)</p>
<p>In his book, <i>&#8220;The Sign of the Serpent</i>,&#8221; Mark Balfour relates how pervasive serpent symbols are within India and the Hindu religion:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Any observant traveler who moves from the snow-tipped Himalayas in the North to the sun-soaked sands of Cape Comorin at India&#8217;s southern tip, will encounter – particularly in the rural areas and at sacred centres of pilgrimage wherever Siva, God of both Divine Wisdom and regeneration, is the presiding Deity – the serpent motif sculptured within shrines, impressed on myriads of stone implants in the ground and depicted in art</i>.&#8221; (<i>A Short Guide to Occult Symbols: Serpent Power</i>, Carl Teichrib, 2005, Kjos Ministries)</p>
<p>Balfour elaborates on this belief:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In Hinduism, the Cosmic Serpent – Ananta Sesha – symbolic of timeless eternity, carries the world on his 1000-fold [Cobra] hood&#8230;As the creative impulse stirs within the great Serpent in the Sky – when passive idea becomes active thought – the forces of attraction and repulsion come into play as &#8216;spirit&#8217; begins its involution into &#8220;matter</i>.&#8221; (ibid, Teichrib)</p>
<p>Moreover, Kundalini yoga, a discipline within Hinduism, teaches that latent serpent power lies at the base of the etheric human spine,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<i>like a coiled serpent, ready to sprin</i>g.&#8221; (<i>Harper&#8217;s Dictionary of Hinduism</i>, p. 156, ibid, Teichrib)</p>
<p>Through strenuous yoga techniques, serpent power uncoils and rises through seven <i>&#8220;chakras&#8221;</i> or power centers within the human body. Serpent power is considered,</p>
<p>&#8220;(to be a) <i>concentrated field of intelligent cosmic, invisible energy absolutely vital to life beginning in the base of the spine as a man or a woman begins to evolve in their first incarnation</i>.&#8221; (<i>The Donning International Encyclopedic Psychic Dictionary,</i> p. 343, ibid, Teichrib)</p>
<p><b>&#8220;<i>Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field&#8230;&#8221;</i> </b>– Genesis 3:1</p>
<p>Serpent power is imparted by laying on of hands, or Shakti-pat.  The demon-possessed Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajineesh was called the &#8220;divine drunkard&#8221; by his disciples, and according to Tal Brook, author of “Riders of the Cosmic Circuit,” by his millions of worshippers in India, America, and Europe and throughout the world.  Rajineesh encouraged his devotees to come and drink from him, meaning, receive his touch:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>His spiritual &#8216;wine&#8217; was often passed on with a single touch to the head (Shakti-pat), at which his followers would collapse in ecstatic laughter. Another famous guru, Swami Muktananda, would hold meetings at which thousands of his followers from around the world came to receive his touch.  They experienced uncontrollable laughing, roaring, barking, hissing, crying, shaking, as well as falling unconscious.&#8221;</i>(Rose, p. 217)</p>
<p>These demon-possessed gurus were imparting to their adoring worshippers experiences they had undergone during initiation rituals and which they attributed to spirit-possession.</p>
<p>Veteran researcher Brooks Alexander observes of Rajineesh, Muktananda and other gurus:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>All of these gurus espouse a similar philosophy, and they all turn it into practice in a similar way.  It is a pattern that we find not only in tantra (Indo-Tibetan occultism), but in European Satanism, antinomian Gnosticism, and ancient pagan sorcery as well.&#8221; </i>(Book Review: Riders of the Cosmic Circuit,&#8221; in SCP Journal, Vol. 7, No. 1, 1987, p. 39)</p>
<p>According to Alexander, Satan&#8217;s servants have successfully assimilated occult Eastern teachings and techniques into our church and our culture.  With remarkable speed and ease, Eastern and occult ideas and spiritist techniques for contacting spirits such as trance music, brain-altering drugs, meditation and yoga are being propagated to undiscerning Westerners and Americans, within and without the church, on a mass scale:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<i>they are filtered through the pervasive secularism of our culture.  In this way they are demystified without changing their essential content.  The basic components of an Eastern/occult world view are recast in forms of expression that are naturalistic, scientific, and humanistic&#8230;Occult philosophy is being secularized and psychologized with increasing refinement&#8230;.Their underlying themes run through contemporary science, economics, politics, art, psychology, and religion.&#8221;  </i>(The Coming Darkness, p. 55)</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Be sober, be vigilant: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour</b>.&#8221; 1  Peter 5:8</p>
<p>Satan&#8217;s servants are out in the open today.  They have successfully initiated a devastating assault upon the whole body of the Christian church and by extension, upon Western and American society in ways that to previous generations would have seemed unthinkable.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.&#8221;  </i>Ephesians 6:11</p>
<p>And though all may seem dark, hopeless and lost, fear not, for the faithful believer, the one who seeks and perseveres in Truth, is of God:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.&#8221; </i>(1 John 4:4)</p>

<p>“To gain this victory, we must wage the war.  Too many want victory without the war, as though eloquence, patriotic or religious gush, ever overcame an enemy.”  R. J.  Rushdoony,” Numbers” Pg. 270</p>
<p>Patty and I spent Christmas in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDestin%2C_Florida&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMTAlzLDogq1hcC87DeZ89oYRgJg" target="_blank">Destin, Florida</a>.  Destin is an upscale resort town named from a Yankee fisherman who settled there in the mid-Nineteenth Century.  It is home to one of the nation’s largest outlet malls.</p>
<p>In one of the shoe outlets we met a clerk from Maine.  Her story is typical of many who have been victimized by the massive changes that have been foisted on the world.  Born, raised, and married in a shoe prosperous Maine town, she and her husband had two children and were living lavishly.  He was a manager at a shoe manufacturing plant where she also worked.  Their combined income was in the high six figures providing them a luxurious lifestyle.</p>
<p>As the inexorable Asian labor monster invaded the shoe industry her husband lost his job. The entire industry shrunk and he was unable to find work.   She became the sole wage earner under a company promise that there would be no additional lay-offs.  The promise was broken and shortly her job was also moved offshore.   They lost everything: their home, their car, and their ability to support two children.  Without prospects of employment in Maine they moved to Florida where they are now working at dramatically lower incomes.  They have re-established their family and, though far less affluent, are again living an orderly life.  Since many employees of Maine factories are still struggling, they consider themselves fortunate.</p>
<p>Their story can be multiplied hundreds-of -thousands of times as industry after industry has been devastated by the planned economic reorganization of the world.</p>
<p>Maine is one of a number of areas that have been severely affected.  The Northeast quadrant has been hardest hit with factory closings and the accompanying disruption of the social order.  Some attempt to cite automation as a culprit but automation provides a social benefit while wholesale robbery is a devastating crime.</p>
<p>The current economic disaster was preceded by an earlier mini-disaster when the Japanese were given free access to our markets.  Now, Asians in several countries have entered the fray and despite efforts by the compliant media to cover it up debilitating disruption is clearly evident.</p>
<p>Since 1950 into the first decade of the Twenty-First Century Detroit, Michigan has lost over 61 percent of its population, Gary, Indiana 55 percent, Youngstown, Ohio over 60, Flint, Michigan over 43, Cleveland, Ohio over 56, Dayton, Ohio over 46,  Canton, Ohio over 37, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania over 54.  Though it is growing in income Chicago has still lost over 25 percent of its population.</p>
<p>The kettle holding the United States population was put over very low heat in the 1950s.  The drum beat of women’s liberation began and continued relentlessly until after several decades single income homes became archaic being replaced by a household income that included two working adults.  This malicious manipulation was imposed without adequate confrontation.</p>
<p>Then we began to hear about the competitive nature of the American work force and how they could successfully compete in the new world market.  Soon the Japanese had usurped a major percentage of the automotive industry forcing the irascibly persuasive Lee Iacocca to shame the congress into loaning Chrysler enough money to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>But the bloody Japanese axe that struck the auto industry was only the beginning.  The Chinese horde soon followed and suddenly every “Made in USA” product disappeared from our stores.  Faced with labor costs a fraction of U. S. standards, industry after industry moved manufacturing to Asia.</p>
<p>The competition was not over the ability of American workers to produce goods as efficiently as Asian labor, as it had been framed.  It was instead over the standard of living Americans had enjoyed compared to the standard of living of Chinese peasants.  As the Twenty-First Century arrived, a multitude of Americans were like the family from Maine working in retail, health-care or fast food for wages of half or less than their previous employment.</p>
<p>Current propaganda tells us our economy is improving and new jobs are being created.  It is all propaganda; don’t believe it!   In the new world order competition will force labor costs to parity and parity is lower still.</p>
<p>Though they have prepared for an uprising the powers behind centralization want to maintain peace as long as they can continue extending world domination.  The media, a propaganda arm of world government, will continue to report improvement as long as people can be convinced.</p>
<p>Human efforts are useless in stopping this onslaught.  The battle is between Christianity and paganism.  The only effective weapon against paganism is the God of the Bible and His Law.</p>
<p>Rousas Rushdoony explains, “When men forsake God, they forsake all truth, because for them there is no difference between good and evil, nor between truth and lies”.  “Numbers” Pg.316</p>
<p>The Bible, Old and New Testament, Law and Grace, comprise the full gospel.  The full gospel would have stopped tyranny in its infancy, but we have forsaken the full gospel and replaced it with the “creative word” of men.   I received an email today from my kid sister entitled “What a Church Service”; a video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=FcLF5wopyjo" target="_blank"><span title="http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=FcLF5wopyjo CTRL + Click to follow link">Andre Rieu leading a musical worship service</span></a> for a large congregation. Beautiful it is, but an appropriate church service it is not.  It is a secular multicultural extravaganza with beautiful music.</p>
<p>Christians who seek to be entertained with music and praise and do not have ears to hear what God requires of His people are useless in stopping the advance of Satan.  It is truth and justice and the seating of King Jesus at the throne of power that should be the objective of every Christian congregation.  Lies, fantasy, and all the manipulations of arrogant men should be confronted from our pulpits and by our congregations.  It is our Christian duty to counter the evil establishment bringing their wrath against the power of the Church of Jesus Christ.  When the Christian religion fails to create wrath in God’s enemies there is a serious problem in the Christian religion.</p>
<p>We are being overrun by the minions of evil.  We should be fighting a war.  We need preachers whose intrepid denouncements will inspire us to enter the battle on the side of the God of the Bible.</p>
<p>The enemy controls our television stations, our newspapers, our government, and, sadly, most of our churches.  The voices of dissent are few.  Wake up Christians and hear the call to battle!</p>
<p>When a newspaper erroneously contends our economy is improving our pulpits must present Christians with the statistics that prove otherwise.  Christians are truth-tellers!  When the Media promotes homosexuality our pulpits must denounce it with God’s Words from the Bible.  Christian duty requires that we confront evil.</p>
<p>Muslims are busy fighting for control of the Middle East.  They appear to be overcoming the secular tyrants.  Islam is a false religion and an enemy to Christianity but it is not the core danger to world freedom. In that battle Islam is an ally against the wicked forces of the new world order.</p>
<p>It is time to stop playing church.  It is time for every Christian minister to disregard reputation and directly confront the secular forces that threaten peace and order God intends for His creation.</p>
<p>Churches that concentrate on the end times, on tongues and prophecy, evangelism, or on being theologically reformed should forsake their niche religions and confront the secular minions with the full gospel.  The size of a church or its growth is of no importance; what is important is its strength against the forces of evil.  Reputations must be sacrificed; our God and King is being threatened and we are His soldiers.  It is our duty to fight for the elevation of His government– both civilians and rulers are subject to the rule of King Jesus.</p>
<p>As Patty and I exited a restaurant in Destin late in the afternoon on Christmas day we noticed a table of 8 young men with their heads bowed.  We thought it wonderful that all these young people were honoring the One True God.  However, on second look they were honoring the IPhone god instead.</p>

<p>America is tumbling out of control toward a crash-and-burn impact with disaster, and, for the most part, pastors and churches are asleep&#8211;I mean in a coma. Both major parties in Washington, D.C., are selling-out our liberties faster than Chris Christie can swallow a Big Mac, and Christians don’t even roll over; George W. Bush and Barack Obama have created the largest surveillance society in the history of mankind, and pastors lie comatose; Dianne Feinstein and her Constitution-hating collaborators in Congress try their best to expunge our right to self-defense, and Christian organizations don’t open an eyelid; the right of Habeas Corpus, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and our very right of privacy have, for all intents and purposes, been eviscerated by the miscreants in Washington, D.C., and most pastors and Christians remain fast asleep. But let a Christian TV star get the axe for telling a magazine reporter that he views homosexuality as sinful, and Christians storm out of their beds like firemen answering the bell for a five-alarm fire.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. The politically-correct entertainment and news industries are hyper-paranoid about anything deemed to be “anti-gay.” Homosexuals currently enjoy more protected status than the spotted owl. That A&#038;E would attempt to suspend a long-bearded, redneck Christian for saying homosexuality is a sin should shock no one. Liberal actor Alec Baldwin (no relation to this writer)&#8211;a darling of the left-wing establishment&#8211;lost his TV show on MSNBC for comments he spoke that were considered to be anti-gay.</p>
<p>Am I glad so many people rallied to the support of Phil Robertson? Yes, of course. Was the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain stupid to pull Duck Dynasty products from their stores as punishment for what Robertson said? They sure were. Are Christians who want to boycott Cracker Barrel and other companies that cater to political-correctness within their rights to do so? You bet. People such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have made careers (not to mention millions of dollars) intimidating private companies with all kinds of boycotts. But I must be honest: this whole episode burns the stew out of me.</p>
<p>In the first place, it doesn’t seem to dawn on the vast majority of pastors, churches, and most of these non-profit Christian organizations what the source of all of this politically-correct bull manure really is. The source of all of this dung is that Cesspool by the Potomac: Washington, D.C. It is the policies, laws, and public statements from the White House, Congress, and Supreme Court&#8211;not to mention all of the politically-correct propaganda being taught in the government schools and universities&#8211;that pressure private companies (especially big companies) to stay on the smiley side of Washington. The IRS can make life a living hell for anyone&#8211;and that includes big companies. It wasn’t that long ago when the federal government almost closed down Cracker Barrel for what it perceived as acts of discrimination. Take away the intimidation of Washington, D.C., from most of these companies, and the majority of these politically-correct issues (including the homosexual issue) would disappear.</p>
<p>If Christians really wanted to boycott the institution with the biggest pro-homosexual agenda in the world, they would boycott paying taxes to the IRS. Through the US State Department and Pentagon, the homosexual agenda is not only being advanced domestically but internationally. Our State Department hires open homosexuals as diplomats and sends them to countries that hold deep religious and cultural aversions to that lifestyle. More than one country has the homosexual lifestyle thrown in their face through the diplomatic corps of the US State Department. The Pentagon has put homosexuals in the closest of confines with US troops in virtually every military assignment and theater. Various agencies and departments of the federal government spend billions of taxpayer dollars advancing or even demanding a militant homosexual agenda.</p>
<p>Plus, a little intellectual honesty is in order at this point. Not every individual homosexual is a proponent of the militant homosexual agenda. In fact, many homosexuals joined in the chorus of those who were insulted by A&#038;E’s flagrant disregard for Mr. Robertson’s freedom of speech.</p>
<p>I read Robertson’s controversial comments in GQ magazine, and he did NOT single out homosexuality any more than many other acts of immorality. The reporter asked him, “What, in your mind, is sinful?” Robertson simply answered the question by noting a variety of acts he deemed to be sinful by Holy Writ, including sins which he, himself, had committed earlier in his life. He also said that no sin was greater than another sin. He then went on to say that Christ came to redeem men from all of their sin&#8211;whatever it was. Has this not been the message of the Gospel for over 2,000 years?</p>
<p>But I remind you that it has been the federal government that has done more to expunge Christian ideology from US society than any other entity in the world&#8211;especially since 1962 and ’63. And, unfortunately, the CEOs and CFOs of most major corporations are mostly government toadies who will do anything to avoid falling out of the good graces of Washington. Yet, all of this seems lost to the vast majority of pastors, churches, and Christian organizations.</p>
<p>In the second place, it seems to me that the vast majority of pastors and churches only get exercised over two issues: abortion and homosexuality. And lately, most pastors and churches won’t even break a sweat opposing abortion. Where are they on the right of self-defense? Where are they on the right to own property? Where are they on the right of privacy? Where are they on the right to be secure in their own homes? Where are they on the Biblical Natural law principles of self-determination, limited, jurisdictional government, and personal liberty? Every one of these issues is a moral issue. Every one of these issues is a fundamental tenet of Biblical Natural Law. Yet, for the most part, none of these issues warrant even the slightest peep of exhortation from the vast majority of pastors, churches, and Christian organizations today.</p>
<p>Christians by the millions verbally descended upon A&#038;E and Cracker Barrel for the politically-correct firing of one man over his personal opinion. But where are they when the politically-correct culture in Washington, D.C., turns into the force of law? Where are they when unconstitutional and, yes, un-Biblical federal mandates threaten the existence of our liberties and our very way of life? Where are they when the politically-correct usurpers in DC abuse the power and force of law that results in the violation&#8211;not just of one man and one man’s opinion&#8211;but of the liberties of every man, woman, and child in the United States? Where are they? They are sound asleep.</p>
<p>If pastors, churches, and Christian organizations would be as vocal and vehement in opposition to turning our country into a giant police state, we would have our privacy back almost overnight. If pastors, churches, and Christian organizations would be as vocal and vehement in their opposition to DC’s attacks against our right of self-defense, there would never be another gun control bill put forward and the vast majority of prohibitions against the Second Amendment already in place would be overturned almost immediately. If pastors, churches, and Christian organizations would be as vocal and vehement in their opposition to the rampant misuse of our military and police, justice would be restored almost at once.</p>
<p>Let’s be brutally honest: the reason this country is in the dung heap it is in is directly due to the sluggish indifference of America’s pastors, churches, and Christian organizations. And I think the flap at A&#038;E and Cracker Barrel proves it.</p>
<p>The massive outcry of millions of pastors and Christians around the country influenced A&#038;E to rehire Phil Robertson. This same outcry influenced Cracker Barrel to return Duck Dynasty products to their stores. If the same kind of massive outcry from millions of pastors and Christians would target the destruction of our Natural God-given liberties emanating from Washington, D.C., the course of our country could be turned around almost overnight. But now that Phil is back on the show and Duck Dynasty products are back on the shelves at Cracker Barrel, I’m confident most of these pastors and Christians are already back in their beds.</p>
