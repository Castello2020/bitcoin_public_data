<p>Commenting recently on the Elliot Rodger killings, arch-leftist Michael Moore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/posts/10152065762191857?fref=nf" target="_blank">wrote</a> that while “other countries have more violent pasts…more guns per capita in their homes…and the kids in most other countries watch the same violent movies and play the same violent video games that our kids play, no one even comes close to killing as many of its own citizens on a daily basis as we do….” From a man who used to take the simple-minded gun-control position “fewer guns=less homicide,” it was surprising evidence of growth. After making his point, however, Moore made a mistake in following up with, “and yet we don&#8217;t seem to want to ask ourselves this simple question: &#8220;Why us? What is it about US?” It’s not, however, that we don’t want to ask the question.</p>
<p>It’s that we don’t want to hear the answer.</p>
<p>We can begin seeking it by asking another question: Why is it that Vermont, with approximately the same rate of gun ownership as Louisiana, has less than one-eighth the murder rate? Even more strikingly, why does New Hampshire have both a far higher gun ownership rate <em>and</em> a lower murder rate than England, Piers Morgan’s favorite poster-boy nation for gun control?</p>
<p>Professor Thomas Sowell provided more of these seeming contradictions in 2012, <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/gun-381016-control-murder.html" target="_blank">writing</a>:</p>
<p>When it comes to the rate of gun ownership, that is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, but the murder rate is higher in urban areas. The rate of gun ownership is higher among whites than among blacks, but the murder rate is higher among blacks.</p>
<p>… [There are also] countries with stronger gun control laws than the United States, such as Russia, Brazil and Mexico. All of these countries have higher murder rates than the United States.</p>
<p>You could compare other sets of countries and get similar results. Gun ownership has been three times as high in Switzerland as in Germany, but the Swiss have had lower murder rates. Other countries with high rates of gun ownership and low murder rates include Israel, New Zealand, and Finland.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer we don’t want to hear? The critical difference among these regions and nations is explained right in Sowell’s title: it’s “not guns.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s people.”</p>
<p>What “people” differences are relevant? Let’s start with race and ethnicity. In the cases of homicide in 2012 in which the races of the perpetrators were known, 55 percent were <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2012.xls" target="_blank">committed</a> by blacks, 62 percent of whom were under 30 years of age. Black youths are 16 percent of the youth population, but constitute 52 percent of those arrested for juvenile violent crime.</p>
<p>The statistics for Hispanics are more difficult to ferret out because, unbeknownst to many, law enforcement agencies tend to lump them in with whites in crime statistics (the FBI has <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2013/06/28/fbi-to-categorize-latinos-in-crime-statistics/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it will finally categorize Hispanic crime — in its report on 2013). However, there is some information available. Examiner’s Ken LaRive <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/federal-statistics-of-black-on-white-violence-with-links-and-mathematical-extrapolation-formulas" target="_blank">tells us</a> that “Hispanics commit three times more violent crimes than whites,” but that the disparity could be even greater because of their often being classified as white.</p>
<p>The National Youth Gang Survey Analysis <a href="http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Survey-Analysis/Demographics" target="_blank">report</a>s that gang members are approximately 49 percent Hispanic, 35 percent black and 10 percent white. And while whites are 35 percent of NYC’s population, blacks and Hispanics <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/2013/07/19/black-americas-real-problem-isnt-white-racism/" target="_blank">commit</a> 96 percent of all crime in the Big Apple and 98 percent of all gun crime.</p>
<p>Another good indicator is international crime statistics. Hispanic countries <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate_by_decade#2010s" target="_blank">dominate</a> the homicide-rate rankings, with Honduras topping the list with a rate eight times as high as that of our worst state, Louisiana. Also note that there are no European/European descent nations in the top 20 and not one Western-tradition nation in the top 30 (Russia and Moldova are 24 and 28, respectively).</p>
<p>And what can we say about these “people” differences? It’s much as with the question of why men are more likely to be drunkards than women. You could explore whether the differences were attributable to nature, nurture or both. But it would be silly to wonder if the answer lay in men having greater access to bars, alcohol or shot glasses.</p>
<p>This brings us to why covering up minority criminality encourages gun control:</p>
<p>Americans won’t understand that the critical factor is people differences if they aren’t told about the people differences.</p>
<p>They will then — especially since most citizens aren’t even aware that there are nations with more firearms but less murder — be much more likely to blame guns. Of course, this is precisely what you want if you’re a left-wing media propagandist.</p>
<p>There is a question that could now be posed by the other side: if the main difference in criminality is demographics, why not outlaw guns? After all, it won’t make a difference one way or the other, right? I’ll offer a couple of answers to this question.</p>
<p>First, for a people to maintain just liberties, a freedom must <em>always</em> be considered innocent until proven guilty; the burden of proof is not on those who would retain it, but on those who would take it away.</p>
<p>Second, while private gun ownership and just law enforcement can’t turn barbarians into civilized people any more than excellent schools can transform dunces into geniuses, they can act as mitigating factors that minimize criminality as much as possible given the “raw material” with which the particular society has to work. It’s much as how you can maximize your personal safety: you may be safer in a great neighborhood with no martial arts training than in a terrible one with that training. Nonetheless, it allows you to be safer than you would be otherwise whatever neighborhood you choose.</p>
<p>And what do the stats show in our fair to middling USA neighborhood? Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck reported that guns are used by good citizens 2.2 to 2.5 million times per year to deter crime. That likely saves many more innocent lives than are lost in massacres every year, but these unseen non-victims don’t make headlines the way Sandy Hook tragedies do. That’s why I like to say, using a twist on a Frédéric Bastiat line, a bad social analyst observes only what can be seen. A good social analyst observes what can be seen — and what must be foreseen.</p>
<p>Lastly, one more truth becomes evident upon recognizing that demographics are the main factor in criminality: even if you do believe in gun control, imposing it federally and applying a one-size fits all standard is ridiculous. In terms of people and crime, there’s a world of difference between towns in New Hampshire or Vermont, with their England-level murder rates, and cities such as East St. Louis, IL, or Detroit, which rival El Salvador in citizen lethality. You can make gun control the same everywhere, but you can’t change the fact that people will be very, very different.</p>

</div>
<p>Turkey seems fond of so-called ‘false flag’ operations.  In 1955, for example, the Turkish government <a name="0.1__Hlt389423584"></a><a name="0.1__Hlt389423585"></a><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SdubdhMwM1YC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=1955+turkish+thessaloniki+september+5&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O7NHJneGjC&amp;sig=ajqdcxRUjGySQOuzaDDtZVTv1v8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EduLU5GdDaeqsQSB7oCoAg&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1955%20turkish%20thessaloniki%20september%205&amp;f=false" target="_blank">covertly</a> bombed its own consulate in Thessaloniki, Greece and blamed it on Greeks.  The following day, Turkey stage-managed massive anti-Greek <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_pogrom" target="_blank">riots</a> in Istanbul that killed over a dozen Christians and caused hundreds of millions in damage.</p>
<p>Fast forward to March 2014.   A leaked audiotape caught Turkish officials <a href="http://www.whiteoutpress.com/articles/2014/q1/leaked-recording-shows-turkey-to-attack-itself-blame-syria/" target="_blank">plotting</a> to stage ‘false flag’ military attacks on their own territory and blame them on Syrians.   Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, General Yaşar Gürel, and Intelligence chief Hakan Fidan planned to use the attacks as an excuse to invade Syria.   The title of this article could easily apply to that plot.</p>
<p>To close observers of the Caucasus, however, it could also describe a failed covert Turkish plan to attack Armenia two decades ago and turn the geopolitics of the region upside down.</p>
<p>In October 1993, two years after the USSR had splintered, an ethnic Chechen Muslim named Ruslan Khasbulatov – the Speaker, believe it or not, of the Russian Parliament – led a <a name="0.1__Hlt389508423"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Russian_constitutional_crisis" target="_blank">coup</a> against beleaguered Russian President Boris Yeltsin.  According to American, French, and Greek officials, Khasbulatov and Muslim Turkey had a secret agreement.</p>
<p>If his coup succeeded, Khasbulatov would order Russian troops to withdraw from Armenia, where they helped guard the latter’s border with Turkey.   That would pave the way for Turkey to invade the landlocked Christian nation of just three million inhabitants.</p>
<p>History tells us that Turkey has always wanted to overrun Armenia.   Doing so would create a path to Turkic-speaking Muslim Azerbaijan, the Caspian Sea, and, eventually, Central Asia.  It’s called pan-Turkism.</p>
<div>
<img src="http://www.thetotalcollapse.com/wp-content/uploads/Caucasus_Map.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>In 1993, of course, Azerbaijan was losing its war with Armenians over the ancient, majority-Armenian province of <a href="https://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/karabagh.html" target="_blank">Karabagh</a>.   Azerbaijan was, therefore, eager for Turkey to attack Armenia, and Turkey was ready to help Azerbaijan turn the tide.</p>
<p><strong>The Plot Fails</strong></p>
<p>Harkening back to the Armenian genocide, Turkish President Turgut Özal had <a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/centers/armenian/source106.html" target="_blank">threatened</a> to teach Armenia “the lessons of 1915.”  Tansu Çiller, Turkey’s prime minister, <a href="http://www.armenianow.com/news/politics/32122/turkey_armenia_azerbaijan_karabakh_war" target="_blank">warned</a> Armenia that she wouldn’t “sit back and do nothing.”  Turkey was massing forces on Armenia’s western border and <a href="http://armenianhouse.org/demoyan/turkey/index.html" target="_blank">supplying</a> Azerbaijan with weapons, military advisors, and paramilitary forces.  Chechen militants and Afghan Mujahideen were already fighting alongside Azeris.</p>
<p>A successful Turkish attack on Armenia – Russia’s only military partner in the Caucasus – would have all but destroyed Russian influence in the region.  That, in turn, would have increased the likelihood that Chechnya, and much of the Muslim North Caucasus, would eventually escape the Russian Bear’s grip.  For a native-born Chechen like Khasbulatov, it would all be a dream-come-true.</p>
<p>But bombarded by Russian tanks, Speaker Khasbulatov, V.P. Alexander Rutskoi, and hundreds of rebel parliamentarians and supporters <a href="http://rt.com/news/parliament-siege-yeltsin-timeline-691/" target="_blank">surrendered</a> the Parliament building on October 4, 1993.  The coup and the plot to invade Armenia had failed.</p>
<p><strong>The Secret Pact</strong></p>
<p>The Khasbulatov-Turkish pact was first revealed by Leonidas T. Chrysanthopoulos in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Caucasus-Chronicles-Nation-Building-Diplomacy-1993-1994/dp/1884630057" target="_blank">Caucasus Chronicles</a> (London:  Gomidas, 2002).   He was Greece’s ambassador to Armenia from July 1993 to February 1994.   Chrysanthopoulos, now 68, has served as ambassador to Canada and Poland, and was recently Secretary General of the 12-country, Istanbul-based Black Sea Economic Cooperation organization.</p>
<p>France’s ambassador to Armenia, Mme. France de Harthing, told him that “French intelligence sources” confirmed that “the Turkish incursion into Armenia would take place immediately after Khasbulatov would have withdrawn the Russian troops from Armenia.”   “This information,” wrote Chrysanthopoulos, “was later confirmed to me by my United States colleague,” Ambassador Harry J. Gilmore.</p>
<p>As a “pretext,” Turkey would claim to be targeting Kurdish PKK militant bases, which in fact have never existed, in Armenia.  Such a “pretext” is similar, though not identical, to a ‘false flag.’</p>
<p>The Turkish strike would be “incursions of a limited nature,” though it’s unclear what “limited” meant.  More likely, as Turkey wouldn’t find any PKK, the aim was to forge a permanent corridor across Armenia, link up with Azeri forces, and cleanse Karabagh of Armenians.</p>
<p>The U.S. and France have never, as far as is known, publicly denied the existence of the Khasbulatov-Turkish plot.  Moreover, Chrysanthopoulos gives no indication that any country tried to talk Turkey out of its deal with Khasbulatov.</p>
<p>Is any of this relevant today?</p>
<p><strong>NATO Ambitions</strong></p>
<p>Yes, because current Turkish, American, and NATO policies in the Caucasus strongly echo the 1993 Khasbulatov-Turkish plot.  For two decades, the West has been trying to penetrate and dominate the Caucasus – Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia –and eventually cross the Caspian Sea into energy-rich Central Asia.</p>
<p>One piece of the plan has already been partially implemented: constructing oil and gas pipelines from Azerbaijan through Georgia and Turkey.</p>
<p>NATO’s remaining goal: absorb the entire Caucasus.  NATO would thereby threaten Russia from the south, just as it now pressures Russia from the west with its absorption of much of Eastern Europe (and, NATO hopes, Ukraine).</p>
<p>Georgia and Azerbaijan are inclined to eventually join NATO.   Armenia, however, is not, though it has excellent relations with NATO and the West.  Armenia has little choice but to ally itself with Russia because the former faces an ongoing existential threat from NATO member Turkey, the 1993 plot being one example.</p>
<p>Armenia is the Caucasus&#8217;s linchpin.  Had the Khasbulatov &#8211; Turkish quasi-‘false flag’ operation against Armenia succeeded, Russia would probably have lost, and NATO would have gained, the entire Caucasus.   New provocations, including ‘false flags,’ by Turkey and NATO cannot, therefore, be ruled out.</p>
<p>Turkish, American, and NATO leaders must also be interrogated as to whether their policies in the Caucasus are leading to peace or war.</p>

<p><strong><em>“Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge, which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible…” </em><em>– George Orwell, 1984</em></strong></p>
<p>Nations, cultures and populations are best controlled through the use of false paradigms. This is a historically proven tactic exploited for centuries by oligarchs around the world. Under the Hegelian dialectic (the very foundation of the Marxist and collectivist ideology), one could summarize the trap of false paradigms as follows:</p>
<p><em>If (A) my idea of freedom conflicts with (B) your idea of freedom, then (C) neither of us can be free until everyone agrees to be a slave.</em></p>
<p>In other words: problem, reaction, solution. Two sides are pitted against each other in an engineered contest. Each side is led to believe that its position is the good and right position. Neither side questions the legitimacy of the conflict, because each side fears this will lead to ideological weakness and disunity.</p>
<p>The two sides go to war, sometimes economically, sometimes militarily. Both governments demand that individuals relinquish freedom, independence and self-reliance, a sacrifice that “must be made” so that victory can be achieved. In the end, neither nation nor society has truly won. The only winners are the oligarchs, who sing words of loyalty to their respective camps, while acting in league from the very beginning. The oligarchs, who never intended to target each other in the first place. Their target, their ONLY target, was the citizenry itself — the dumbfounded masses now mesmerized with shock, awe and terror.</p>
<p>The false paradigm method and the Hegelian dialectic are in full force today. Only a few years ago, Russia, China and the United States were considered close economic and political allies. Today, those alliances are being quickly scrapped in order to make room for conflict, a conflict useful only to a select international elite. As I have outlined in numerous articles, including<em><a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2074-russia-is-dominated-by-global-banks-too">Russia Is Dominated By Global Banks, Too</a> </em>and <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2126-false-eastwest-paradigm-hides-the-rise-of-global-currency"><em>False East/West Paradigm Hides The Rise Of Global Currency</em></a>, when one looks beyond all the theatrical rhetoric being thrown around between Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, the ultimate reality is that the relationship of both governments to the global banking elite is the same.</p>
<p>During both of Obama’s Presidential terms, he has flooded his cabinet with current and former<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.whiteoutpress.com/articles/q42012/list-of-goldman-sachs-employees-in-the-white-house/" target="_blank">employees of Goldman Sachs</a>, a longtime proving ground for elitist financiers with globalist aspirations.</p>
<p>And who is the primary economic adviser to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state? Why<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-05/goldman-sachs-hired-by-russia-as-corporate-broker-to-boost-image.html" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a>, of course!</p>
<p>U.S. and European elites have been calling for a centralization of economic power under the control of the International Monetary Fund, as a well as a new <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2011/0214/297662-g20/" target="_blank">global currency</a>.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Putin also wants a new <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html" target="_blank">global currency</a> under the control of the IMF.</p>
<p>Obama is closely advised by globalists like Zbigniew Brzezinski, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and cofounder of the Trilateral Commission, who in his book <em>Between Two Ages: America’s Role In The Technetronic Era</em> states:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;The nation-state is gradually yielding its sovereignty …[F]urther progress will require greater American sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the present relatively favorable American position…&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>As long as he has been in power, Putin has been closely advised by <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/world/europe/henry-kissinger-to-meet-with-vladimir-putin-in-russia.html?_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">Henry Kissinger</a>, yet another member of the CFR and proponent of the Trilateral Commission, who <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/henry-kissinger-the-world-must-forge-a-new-order-or-retreat-to-chaos-1451416.html" target="_blank">has said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;In the end, the political and economic systems can be harmonized in only one of two ways: by creating an international political regulatory system with the same reach as that of the economic world; or by shrinking the economic units to a size manageable by existing political structures, which is likely to lead to a new mercantilism, perhaps of regional units. A new Bretton Woods kind of global agreement is by far the preferable outcome…&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Both Kissinger and Brzezinski refer to this harmonized global economic and political structure as the “New World Order.” The fact that the political leaders of Russia and the United States are clearly being directed by such men should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>China, too, has made demands for a restructuring of the global monetary system into a<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7851925a-17a2-11de-8c9d-0000779fd2ac.html" target="_blank">centralized currency basket</a> under the dominance of the IMF.</p>
<p>China’s <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.thedailybell.com/news-analysis/35155/Directed-History-of-the-Citys-Alliance-with-China/" target="_blank">ties to the banking elite</a> of London are well documented.</p>
<p>The call on both sides for a new monetary system and the end of the dollar as world reserve seems to greatly contradict the fantasy that the East and West are fundamentally at odds.  The progression towards a world currency and/or economic governance also appears to be growing along with the consolidation of economic and military ties between Eastern nations. This would suggest that the rise of the East and the crippling of Western elements is actually advantageous to global bankers in the long term.</p>
<p>While disinformation agents and media shills have attempted to downplay any danger to the strength of America and the dollar, Eastern governments have been swiftly establishing alliances and decoupling from U.S. influence.</p>
<p>The historic 30-year <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/pikeresearch/2014/05/30/russia-china-gas-deal-narrows-window-for-u-s-exports/" target="_blank">Russia/China gas deal</a> has, of course, been finalized. This deal is already eating up market space and influencing the way in which the energy trade traditionally behaves.</p>
<p>China and Russia have also <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101705303">expanded on their bilateral agreements made in 2010</a>, which remove the dollar as the reserve currency in transactions between the two nations.</p>
<p>China’s thirst for gold continues, while the country is now building its own <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.metal.com/newscontent/61012_china-invites-top-foreign-banks-to-global-gold-exchange" target="_blank">gold exchange</a> to rival the U.S. Comex.</p>
<p>Russia has recently established what Putin calls the “Eurasian Economic Union,” a deal which includes Kazakhstan and Belarus, two countries that hold large, freshly discovered <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/29/us-ukraine-crisis-eurasia-idUSKBN0E90O520140529" target="_blank">oil fields</a>.</p>
<p>In response to the engineered conflict over Ukraine, as well as the “Asian-Pacific Pivot” by the U.S., China has openly called for a new <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-calls-for-new-security-pact-with-russia-iran/" target="_blank">security pact</a> with Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget that China is set to surpass the U.S. as the <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/china-business/9947825/China-to-overtake-America-by-2016.html" target="_blank">world’s largest economy</a> by 2016, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>While the rise of the East is being painted in Western circles as a threat to U.S. and NATO dominance, the bigger picture is being hidden from view. Yes, indeed, the consolidation of the East is a considerable threat to the dollar and the U.S. economy — most importantly in the event that China refuses to accept dollars as payment on exports and debts. With the world’s largest exporter/importer refusing to take dollars as a reserve, most nations will inevitably follow their lead.  The argument against this development is, of course, that there is no rational trigger for such a violent fiscal attack. I would remind skeptics that there was no rational trigger for the current strengthened relations between Russia and China until the Ukraine crisis. Is anyone really foolish enough to bet against another direct or indirect conflict between NATO and the East? And is anyone really ignorant enough to assume that said event would not be used as an excuse to cut the legs out from under the dollar completely?</p>
<p>The New World Order players have positioned the East and West for just such a scenario. Why? In my article <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2145-who-is-the-new-secret-buyer-of-us-debt"><em>Who Is The New Secret Buyer Of U.S. Debt?</em></a>, I give evidence indicating that the Bank of International Settlements and the IMF are preparing the financial world for a new global monetary system, brought into existence by a second Bretton Woods conference. The debasement of the dollar and the rise of the East are NOT obstacles to this plan.  Rather, they are required factors. There can be no truly global economic system without “harmonization”, the demise of the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status, and the end of sovereign economic governance.</p>
<p>For those who doubt this scenario, read Paul Volcker’s latest statement, as reported by <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-06-01/paul-volcker-proposes-new-breton-woods-system-prevent-frequent-destructive-financial" target="_blank">Zero Hedge</a>.</p>
<p>Volcker, the same man who was directly involved in the destruction of the first Bretton Woods agreement and the final death rattle of the gold standard, is now promoting a NEW Bretton Woods-style agreement in which currencies are pegged to a controlled market system — in essence, a centralized international monetary system. Volcker also suggests that a single nation-based reserve currency like the dollar may be a danger to overall fiscal health.</p>
<p>Volcker is right. The dollar-dominated forex casino and fiat fraud is a danger to the world. Volcker helped make it that way! And what a surprise, the former Federal Reserve chairman has a solution on a silver platter for the American people — all we need is GLOBALcentralization and bureaucratic oversight.</p>
<p>The propaganda is being carefully planted within the mainstream. Christine Lagarde of the IMF now spends the whole of her media interviews inserting the phrase “global economic reset” without explaining exactly what that would entail, while central banking elites like Volcker suggest a Bretton Woods II conference leading to a global monetary authority. In the meantime, Russian government-funded media outlets like RT produce pieces <a style="color: #006699;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvKucpTckjA">accusing the U.S. of being a nuclear menace</a> while we Americans get to watch manipulative Hollywood films like <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/JRshadowRecruit.html" target="_blank">“Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,”</a> which depicts a Russian plot to collapse the U.S. economy.  China and U.S. representatives <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2014/0531/US-and-China-accuse-each-other-of-intimidation-and-coercion">squabble with each other at geopolitical meetings</a> fueling fears of diplomatic breakdown, while the Pentagon &#8220;suggests&#8221; they may have to revamp their military strategies in <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://news.yahoo.com/west-ponders-stop-fight-great-war-113159434.html">consideration of yet another World War</a>.  Just as in Orwell&#8217;s book, 1984, old enemies become allies and then enemies once again, and at the top of the pyramid, it&#8217;s all a farce.</p>
<p>The best lies contain elements of truth. The truth here is that the East is forming alliances in opposition to the West, the West is involved in underhanded covert operations all over the planet, and both “sides” are in fact on the verge of a catastrophic battle for supremacy. The great lie is that important details have been left out of our little story. Both sides are merely puppet pieces in a grand game of global chess, and any conflict will ultimately benefit the small group of men standing over the board. They include the international financiers who have influenced the very policy fabric of each government toward a climactic crisis which they hope will finally give them the “New World Order” they have always dreamed of.</p>

<p>During my youth, I grew up as a “Service Brat.”  My dad served 27 years in the U.S. Marine Corps.  I respected God, the Stars and Stripes, America and our presidents without question.  I loved my mom’s apple pie!</p>
<p>However, credible researches discovered that President Franklin D. Roosevelt “let” Pearl Harbor occur to draw public support to jump the United States into World War II.</p>
<p>Our kids fought the Korean War because somebody in Harry S. Truman’s circle decided we needed to stop communism over 10,000 miles from our shores.  The best bet on who started the Korean War:  a banker, a corporation head or anyone hoping to make enormous gains off mass deaths.</p>
<p>By the time Vietnam conscripted and killed a lot of my friends, as well as my own time in the U.S. Army, I learned about lies, corruption, bankers and the real reason for Vietnam.  I learned that presidents lie. They think nothing of sacrificing young men in ridiculous wars such as Lyndon Baines Johnson’s onslaught of Southeast Asia.  He killed over 2.3 million Vietnamese and 58,319 of our young men.  He ruined millions of lives, families and the environment with Agent Orange.</p>
<p>Years later, George W. Bush “created” the Iraq War on his lies and deceptions of “Weapons of Mass Destruction.”  He destroyed an entire functioning civilization, brought endless death and misery to God knows how many people.  We’re still fighting and dying in Afghanistan over a year since bin Laden died at the hands of Navy Seals.</p>
<p>Highly decorated U.S. General Smedley Butler, upon retiring, wrote a book that every American should read:  War is a Racket.  The only people who benefit from war: bankers, munitions manufacturers, clothing and food producers and corporations. They make a lot of money off death of our citizen soldiers.</p>
<p>General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us about the “Military Industrial Complex” that engineers wars, global tensions and anything to shove our kids into uniform and battles.  Congress and presidents shoved our noses into everybody else’s business for decades.</p>
<p>We didn’t listen to Butler.  We “supported” all those wars via massive “advertising” that a “threat” awaited us.  Those wars made a lot of CEOs filthy rich.</p>
<p>In 1971, defense expert Daniel Ellsberg presented the Pentagon Papers exposing the incredible corruption and widening of the Vietnam War by Nixon and Johnson before him—all based on lies.</p>
<p>Last week, NBC’s Brian Williams interviewed “whistleblower” intelligence officer Edward Snowden about the National Security Agency’s incredible spying on American citizens.    I watched the entire interview: Snowden showed himself to be incredibly honest, forthright, concerned, all-American, he honors the U.S. Constitution and he is a man of principles.  He chronicled his work in the government that opened him to the corruption at the highest offices in our government. </p>
<p>Secretary of State Kerry called Snowden a “Traitor, coward and should come home to face the music.”</p>
<p>Daniel Ellsberg responded, “Kerry’s remarks are despicable!”</p>
<p>I agree.  We need 10,000 Edward Snowden’s.  In America today, we face incredible corruption in our Congress and Mr. Obama himself.  The list grows:  Fast and Furious, won’t enforce our immigration laws, phony Social Security number, Benghazi killings, suing states from enforcing their own laws, continue to fund 10 year wars when they know they are futile, and on and on.  The corruption in Congress runs wide, deep and sickening from 20 and 30 year career Senators and Congressmen swimming in lies, cheating and playing the American people. Insider military trading on the stock market, paid off by corporations to NOT enforce our immigration laws and another 100 crimes against the American people.</p>
<p>“So many things we are told are untrue,” said Snowden.  “The Iraq War was launched on false premises.  We were led by false statements to go into Iraq.”</p>
<p>I can stand with Snowden because I know we marched into Vietnam on the same false statements such as the “Gulf of Tonkin Incident.”</p>
<p>When he tried to notify superiors, they said, “You should stop asking questions.”</p>
<p>I faced the same thing when I served as an officer in the U.S. Army.  I learned to never question orders.  If I did, command officers ridiculed me. I learned quickly to follow the military protocol.</p>
<p>Snowden said, “I watched the government’s dishonesty.  What was going on needed to be told to the public. I did nothing to harm the citizens or soldiers of America.”</p>
<p>Williams asked, “Why won’t you come home and face the music?”</p>
<p>“The Espionage Act states that you cannot have a defense,” said Snowden.  “The music is not an open court or fair trail.”</p>
<p>“Are you blameless,” asked Williams.</p>
<p>“The most important idea is that what is right may not be legal,” said Snowden.</p>
<p>I can attest to that fact.  Once the man or “group” who gained George Bush’s ear turned the crank to initiate the Iraq War, no sane, rational or reasoning man could stop it.</p>
<p>“We are seeing an erosion and obstruction of our rights as citizens under the NSA,” said Snowden.  “I felt that I was/am serving my country and protecting my fellow citizens.  Even one of the U.S. Senators said that bulk surveillance is unacceptable.  We see senior officials taking powers they don’t warrant.  In the end, I did the right thing.”</p>
<p>I applaud Snowden. If more Snowden’s stood up in the face of withering criticism or “following the power elites” that create wars or spy on our own citizens or recklessly endanger our country—none of our kids would have died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Desert Storm or Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Look to career U.S. Senators like Feinstein, Boxer, Reid, Udall, Bennet, McCain, Kyle, Schumer, Levin, Kerry, Durbin, Kennedy, Hatch, Graham and dozens of other senators for their complicity in driving this country into needless wars, not defending our borders, slamming us into $18 trillion debt and putting all of us at risk.  For example: the current S744, passed by the Senate last year, guarantees our country spirals into the demographic, cultural and linguistic toilet.  Yet, the damned fools passed it.  I recall Mark Twain’s sage words, “Suppose you are an idiot and suppose you are a member of Congress…ah but I repeat myself.”</p>
<p>We should welcome Edward Snowden home as a national hero, and, at the same time shouting out to Secretary of State John Kerry, “You’re despicable beyond measure.” </p>

<p>Ever wonder why nobody (except Kareem Serageldin) went to jail for all the crimes committed during the financial bubble that popped in 2008?</p>
<p>If you think back to the 2000-era bubble, lots of people went to jail for the fraud perpetuated at Enron, Tyco, Adelphia, and other firms. Plus, the law back then destroyed a whole accounting firm — Arthur Andersen, you may remember — and 28,000 jobs along with it, in the wake of the bust.</p>
<p>Yet post-2000, firms with far more brazen crimes got off by paying a mere fine.</p>
<p>Take HSBC.</p>
<p>Its U.S. subsidiary committed, as Taibbi writes, “an astonishing list of crimes — a laundry list that included pretty much every kind of crime a bank can possibly be charged with.”</p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laundering billions of dollars for drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia</li>
<li>Washing money for terrorist-connected organizations in the Middle East</li>
<li>Allowing “rogue states” under formal sanctions by the U.S. to move billions freely through the bank</li>
<li>Helping Russian mobsters wash money under an elaborate traveler’s check scheme</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>And what was the penalty for all this?</p>
<p>$1.9 billion.</p>
<p>At the time, it was the biggest fine in history. But in context, for a firm that made $22 billion per year, it was not much at all. In fact, looked at in a cold calculating light, the message clearly is: Crime pays.</p>
<p>Note there was no jail time for anybody. Everybody at HSBC got paid. Well, HSBC agreed to partially — partially, mind you – defer (!) bonus payments to its top executives.</p>
<p>Oh, and HSBC had to say it was sorry. “We are profoundly sorry,” said CEO Stuart Gulliver.</p>
<p>But how did we get here?</p>
<p>Matt Taibbi explores the reasons in his book The Divide. Taibbi used to write for Rolling Stone. He was the guy who famously called Goldman Sachs a “great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.” (I wish I had written that line.)</p>
<p>He’s a very good investigative reporter and a fine writer. He’s mellowed out a bit in this book and you won’t find much of the usual Taibbi name-calling and profanity. Taibbi, for good or ill, plays this one straight.</p>
<p>He covers a lot of ground, but the central thesis is one most people will intuitively grasp: If you are rich and powerful, you can get away with almost anything. Rights exist on a sliding scale. And if you are on the bottom, you can do time for loitering.</p>
<div id="in-flow-ad">
<div id="beacon_bedaa2c8e7"><img src="http://ads.agorafinancial.com/www/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=2108&amp;campaignid=166&amp;zoneid=182&amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Flfb.org%2Fcrime-pays-and-the-american-gulag%2F&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Flfb.org%2F&amp;cb=bedaa2c8e7" alt="" width="0" height="0" /></div>
</div>
<p>Taibbi writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The cleaving of the country into two completely different states — one a small archipelago of hyper acquisitive untouchables, the other a vast ghetto of expendables with only theoretical rights — has been in the works a long time.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But to answer the question posed up top about why nobody’s going to jail, there’s more to the story. You have to go back to a memo written by Eric Holder, the current attorney general, back in 1999, when he was an official in the Clinton White House.</p>
<p>He articulated a concept called “collateral consequences.”</p>
<p>It meant, in essence, that the government could take into account all kinds of factors like job losses and such in deciding whether to press criminal charges against a big company. “If the math isn’t there,” Taibbi writes summing things up, “hold the charges. Seek other forms of justice instead. Fines. Civil sanctions. Cease and desist orders. Deferred prosecutions. There are other ways, Holder wrote, to get the job done.”</p>
<p>In other words, there would never be another Arthur Andersen. Firms had new ways to wiggle out of criminal charges. Hence, we have the monster we have today. Companies too big to jail.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in other aspects of life, a culture approximating a police state grows apace. Taibbi points to the record levels of incarcerations in the U.S. “Our prison population, in fact, is now the biggest in the history of human civilization,” Taibbi writes. The U.S. has more people behind bars today “than there were at any time in Stalin’s gulags.”</p>
<p>The story here is nasty. He tells the story of private prisons, such as those of Corrections Corp. of America. They get, “depending on whom you believe,” upward of $166 per day from the federal government per inmate. This is four times what it cost back when the government took care of its own detainees.</p>
<p>“The big influx of cash impressed investors on Wall Street,” Taibbi writes. From 2000-2011, CCA’s stock went up 34-fold. Sales went from $300 million to $1.7 billion by 2011. “Overall, the corrections industry is one of the soundest stock/equity bets in the world, with soaring revenues — the industry as a whole pulled in more than $5 billion in America in 2011.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, that didn’t just happen. CCA and others donate generously to politicians. They support anything that might lead to more people spending time in their cells. They particularly like anti-immigrant bills. And Taibbi has harrowing tales about the mistreatment of immigrants in this country. He calls Hispanic immigrants “one of America’s last great cash crops.”</p>
<p>“And someone else wins, too,” Taibbi writes. “Wall Street. Some of the biggest investors in private prison companies are, you guessed it, the too-big-to-fail banks.”</p>
<p>Taibbi writes about an analysis from Zacks that gleefully revels in the lack of economic sensitivity in the business. And then cites a chart with shows a hockey stick increase in the number of incarcerated Americans.</p>
<p>So the country is turning more and more into a dragnet… but only for the poorest. There is no HSBC banker sitting in a CCA cell. It is symbolic of the kind of economy we have today:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Like too-big-to-fail banking itself, private prisons are an industry that depends not on the unpredictable economy but upon political connections. It’s the perfect kind of business in the oligarchical capitalism age, with guaranteed profits to provide a low-cost public insurance against the vagaries of the market.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The economy is riddled with corruption like this, a marriage between big business and Big Government. And a recurring theme in this book is the offspring this marriage creates: a relentless, insatiable bureaucratic force that grinds up individuals fed into its maw.</p>
<p>“These bureaucracies accomplish just two things,” Taibbi writes. “They make small piles of money smaller and big piles of money bigger… It just relentlessly creates and punishes losers, who get to sit beneath an ever-narrowing group of winners, who may or may not stay on top for long.”</p>
<p>Legal rights are not absolute. Those with money who can tirelessly throw lawyers and lawsuits and counterlawsuits at any problem can survive almost anything. For the rest, it’s a matter of attrition. And those at the bottom have no chance.</p>
<p>I can’t do justice to all the journalistic fieldwork and stories Taibbi has put in his 416-page book. It is a gripping read and will infuriate you and frighten you, and maybe even make you sad for what’s happened to the “Land of the Free.”</p>
<p>The book does not have a happy ending. The good guys don’t win in the end. But I encourage you give it a read. What it describes is life in these United States. Those of us who cherish liberty have quite a job ahead of us.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

</div>
<p>President Barack Obama’s commencement address at West Point on May 28 managed to displease pretty much everyone in the nation’s commentariat. Before making an overall assessment of its significance, it is necessary to examine the validity and implications of Obama’s individual statements.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“[B]y most measures America has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world. Those who argue otherwise – who suggest that America is in decline or has seen its global leadership slip away – are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics.”</em></p>
<p>This key assertion, made at the beginning of the President’s address, does not stand to empirical scrutiny. In economic terms, America was <a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/newsletters13/images/52-3-fig4.gif" target="_blank">far stronger</a> vis-à-vis the rest of the world <a href="http://www.growth-dynamics.com/news/sep20_04_files/image004.gif" target="_blank">in 1945</a> than she is today. In more recent times, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_states" target="_blank">U.S. share of world GDP peaked in 1985 with just under 33 percent</a> of global GDP (nominal). Between 2004 and 2014, United States’ share of global gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/270267/united-states-share-of-global-gross-domestic-product-gdp" target="_blank">has fallen from 22.5 percent to 18.5 percent</a>, and it is expected to continue falling. By the end of this year <a href="http://blogs.piie.com/realtime/?p=4297" target="_blank">China will overtake the United States in gross domestic product</a>, which <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d79ffff8-cfb7-11e3-9b2b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz33nby4kyz" target="_blank">had originally been projected to happen</a> by the end of this decade. Analysts concede will gradually <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-economic-power-shifting-in-chinas-favor/2014/05/14/bee0d608-daf3-11e3-b745-87d39690c5c0_story.html" target="_blank">shift the ability to confer advantages or disadvantages on other countries</a> – in other words, power – in China’s favor.</p>
<p>In military terms, while America enjoyed the nuclear monopoly in 1945-49, her period of undisputed unipolar dominance was between 1991 (the collapse of the USSR) and 2008 (Russia’s counterattack in South Ossetia). Although the Pentagon budget will drop from $600 billion this year to $500 billion in 2015, it will continue to account for over a third of the global total. The unsatisfactory outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan and dented America’s image of military invincibility. As <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21601535-no-other-country-comes-close-americas-hard-power-its-lead-slipping-unrivalled" target="_blank">the Economist commented on May 3</a>, “The yawning gap between Uncle Sam and his potential foes seems bound to shrink.” The prevailing view among most critical analysts is that <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/decline-of-the-american-empire-global-configurations-of-power-the-swindle-economy-and-the-criminal-state/5359263" target="_blank">over the past decade the U.S. has suffered military reverses, and now faces severe global competition</a>.</p>
<p>As for the “global leadership,” it is unclear what exactly Obama had in mind. Russia and China are creating a powerful Eurasian counterweight to what they rightly perceive as Washington’s continuing bid for the global hegemony. <a href="https://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/modi-ante-portas" target="_blank">India’s new prime minister</a> is a potential partner at best, and certainly loath to acknowledge America’s “leadership.”  In the Islamic world, Obama’s attempts at appeasement – which started with the Cairo speech in 2009 – have not worked: The U.S. is now <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/15/us-obama-muslims-animosity-deepens" target="_blank">even more unpopular in the Muslim world</a> than it was under George W. Bush. America is heartily disliked even in Turkey and Jordan, presumably our allies, not least because of the continuing drone strikes. American influence in Latin America is weaker now than at any time since Theodore Roosevelt, as manifested in the unanimous rejection of Washington’s efforts to effect a regime change in Venezuela. Members of the American elite class are <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-05-20/opinion/ct-america-standing-overseas-europe-lipson-oped-05-20140520_1_john-kerry-achievement-balance-sheet" target="_blank">hard pressed to name a single country with which the U.S. has better relations today than five years ago</a>. The NSA global spying network has infuriated even some otherwise reliable American friends in Western Europe. Most “Old Europeans” are remarkably resistant to U.S. pressure to agree to serious sanctions against Russia.</p>
<p>On balance it appears that Barack Obama is the one misreading history and engaging in partisan politics.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“Meanwhile, our economy remains the most dynamic on Earth, our businesses the most innovative.”</em></p>
<p>In reality, by most value-neutral parameters the American economy is chronically weak and insolvent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Far from growing, the economy contracted in the first three months of this year at the annualized rate of one per cent, and it is unclear where future growth would come from. Gross domestic income is also <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=bwk" target="_blank">falling sharply, for the first time in years</a>.</li>
<li>There are fewer workers, they are less efficient than a decade ago, and new employment is mostly in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/05/24/temporary-jobs-on-rise-in-shifting-us-economy/9273921/" target="_blank">low-paying part-time jobs</a>. Labor force participation (the percentage of Americans at work) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/29/us-economy-growth-gdp-dip-recovery" target="_blank">is low, at levels not seen</a> since the stagnant economy of the 1970s. One-fifth of 80 million American families <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/famee.pdf" target="_blank">do not have a single employed member</a>.</li>
<li>Government dependence has <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/18-stats-that-prove-that-government-dependence-has-reached-epidemic-levels" target="_blank">reached epidemic levels</a>: the number of Americans getting money or benefits from the federal government exceeds the number of full-time workers in the private sector <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-real-unemployment-rate-in-20-of-american-families-everyone-is-unemployed" target="_blank">by more than 60 million</a>. Welfare spending and entitlement payments account for <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/18-stats-that-prove-that-government-dependence-has-reached-epidemic-levels" target="_blank">69 percent</a> of the federal budget.</li>
<li>One-third of all American households <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/25/news/economy/middle-class-paycheck/index.html?iid=hp_river" target="_blank">are living hand-to-mouth, one paycheck from poverty</a>. The median annual income is <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/median-household-income-update.php" target="_blank">7.5 percent lower than in January 2008</a>.</li>
<li>The inflation-adjusted S&amp;P500 is back to where it was in 2007. The single biggest buyer of stocks are the companies of the S&amp;P500 itself. At $4 trillion, stock buybacks account for one-fifth of the total stock market value. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-27/here-mystery-and-completely-indiscriminate-buyer-stocks-first-quarter" target="_blank">The biggest buyback in market history</a> added zero productive value to the companies concerned.</li>
<li>The mountain of debt <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/np/debt/current" target="_blank">is nearing $17.5 trillion</a>. The drivers of <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2014/05/14/2014-deficit-tells-doesnt-u-s-budget-gap" target="_blank">growing deficits and debt in the future</a> are unfunded entitlement programs <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2014/04/11/washington-post-op-ed-didnt-pay-shes-right/" target="_blank">that are designed to transfer</a> resources from working people to retirees. When the government pension and health care commitments which are missing from official budget figures are accounted for, <a href="http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/books/government-debt-iceberg.pdf" target="_blank">the total national debt is nearly $95 trillion</a>, more than seven times the published figure.</li>
<li>The dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency is almost over. Russia and China have joined forces in “de-dollarization” of their <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/20/russia-china-bankdeal.html" target="_blank">mutual transactions</a> and are looking for a more productive and safe use for their monetary reserves. Their recent gas deal is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/energysource/2014/05/29/the-colder-war-and-the-end-of-the-petrodollar" target="_blank">the beginning of the end for the petrodollar</a>. Eventually Washington will have to choose between an outright default and hyperinflation, and the rest of the world is waking up to that fact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some “dynamism,” some “innovation”…</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“America continues to attract striving immigrants.”</em></p>
<p>Obama’s statement is correct. It does not illustrate America’s alleged strength as was his intent, however; it underscores this country’s major weakness. <a href="http://www.krgv.com/news/lawmaker-illegal-immigration-spiraling-out-of-control" target="_blank">Illegal immigration is spiraling out of control</a>, the Border Patrol is overwhelmed. If the influx continues at current high levels, the U.S. population will increase to almost half a billion in 2060 – more than a 50 percent increase. New immigrants – mostly from the Third World, unskilled, uneducated, and a net drain on American resources – and their descendants will account for over one hundred million of that increase. On current form, English-speaking Americans of European origin will become a minority in their own country four decades from now. They will inhabit an increasingly overpopulated, polluted, lumpenproleterized, permanently impoverished country. America unfortunately does continue “to attract striving immigrants,” mostly illegal ones and of poor quality. This is far greater threat to the survival of the United States in a historically or culturally recognizable form than terrorism or any conceivable alliance of foreign powers. Barack Obama does not understand this, or does not care, or – just as likely – cherishes the prospect.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“The values of our founding inspire leaders in parliaments and new movements in public squares around the globe.”</em></p>
<p>By “public squares” Obama was probably alluding to Kiev’s Maidan. Indeed, it has propelled some “new movements” to global prominence, such as the Svoboda party and the Right Sector. The Founding Fathers would be horrified to learn that, in the opinion of the President of the United States, their values have inspired Messrs. Tyahnybok, Yarosh, and other blood-soaked heirs to Stepan Bandera. This is on par with <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/good-revolutions-gone-bad" target="_blank">Senator Joseph Lieberman saying</a>, “The United States of America and the Kosovo Liberation Army stand for the same values and principles. Fighting for the KLA is fighting for human rights and American values.”</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“And when a typhoon hits the Philippines, or schoolgirls are kidnapped in Nigeria, or masked men occupy a building in Ukraine, it is America that the world looks to for help.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Obama is mixing apples (natural disasters) and pears (man-made ones). The problem of Islamic terrorism in Nigeria was exacerbated by the refusal of the Department of State under Hillary Clinton to place Boko Haram (“Secular Education is Sinful”) on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011, despite the urging of the Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA, and over a dozen Senators and Congressmen. The <em>de facto</em> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/09/opinion/gingrich-hillary-clinton-boko-haram-terrorist" target="_blank">protection thus given to Boko Haram</a> has enabled it to morph into a state-within-the-state with an estimated 300,000 followers.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It would be ironic if “the world” were to look to America for help in Ukraine (which in any event it does not), since the course of crisis there has been, overwhelmingly, of Washington’s own making, as manifested in Victoria Nuland’s famous phone call to Ambassador Pyatt. The new <em>Drang nach Osten</em>makes sense from the point of view of the liberal globalist-neoconservative duopoly: there is no better way to ensure U.S. dominance along the European rimland in perpetuity than drawing Europe back into NATO (i.e. U.S.) security orbit in general and subverting the Russo-German rapprochement in particular. The “masked men” in buildings are a direct consequence of American meddling.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“So the United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century past, and it will be true for the century to come.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It has never been true, it is not true now, and it never will be true. Madeleine Albright’s famous dictum was an arrogant statement by an immigrant ignorant of American history and a sign of her well-attested instability. It was reiterated in Bill Clinton’s 1996 speech, where he <a href="http://opinion.inquirer.net/39396/the-indispensable-nation" target="_blank">explained why he intervened, disastrously, in Bosnia</a>: “The fact is America remains the indispensable nation. There are times when America, and only America, can make a difference between war and peace, between freedom and repression, between hope and fear.” That Obama has chosen to recycle such rubbish is a sign of intellectual and moral bankruptcy. “Indispensable” to whom, exactly? It is unimaginable for the leader of any other country in the world – Vladimir Putin, say, or Xi Jinping – to advance such a claim. It is tasteless at best and psychotically grandomaniac at worst, a latter day “Manifest Destiny” on steroids. The problem is that such hubristic delusions easily translate into non-negotiable foreign policy objectives. Resisting the will of the “indispensable nation” is <em>ipso facto</em> evil: Susan Rice’s condemnation of Chinese and Russian vetoes of the U.S.-supported UN Security Council resolution on Syria as “disgusting,” “shameful” and “unforgivable” comes to mind.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“Russia’s aggression towards former Soviet states unnerves capitals in Europe while China’s economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Quite apart from the genesis of the crisis in Ukraine, to which “Russia’s aggression” hardly applies, Obama’s use of the term “former Soviet states,” plural, implies that in his opinion Ukraine is not the only “victim of Russia’s aggression.” Presumably he means Georgia, the only “former Soviet state” with which Russia has had a conflict since the collapse of the Soviet Union. If so, and there is no other explanation for his turn of his phrase, Obama has a dangerously flawed understanding of the August 2008 Georgian crisis.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Georgian then-President Mikheil Saakashvili’s order to attack South Ossetia’s capital, Tskhinvali, was a breathtakingly audacious challenge to Russia, to which she was bound to react forcefully. That response was promptly exploited, for the first time since Gorbachev, by the American mainstream media machine and the foreign-policy community in Washington to paint Russia as a rogue power that is not only dangerous but intrinsically malignant. The vehemence of that rhetoric exceeded anything ever said or written about <em>jihad</em>, before or after September 11. To be fair, Saakashvili was led to believe that he was tacitly authorized to act as he did. President George W. Bush had treated Georgia as a “strategic partner” ever since the Western-engineered “Rose Revolution” five years earlier, and in early 2008 he strongly advocated NATO membership for Georgia. Washington had repeatedly supported Georgia’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity,” which implied the right to use force to bring South Ossetia and Abkhazia to heel, just as it is supporting “resolute action” in Donetsk and Lugansk today. Saakashvili may be forgiven for imagining that the United States would have bailed him out if things went badly. It is noteworthy that he was not disabused of such notions. The calculus in Washington appears to have been based on a win-win scenario, not dissimilar to the current Ukrainian strategy. Had Georgian troops occupied South Ossetia in a blitzkrieg operation modeled after Croatia’s “Operation Storm,” while the Russians remained hesitant or ineffective, Moscow would have suffered a major strategic and (more importantly) psychological defeat after almost four years of sustained strategic recovery. If Russia intervened, however, she would be duly demonized and the U.S. would push for NATO consolidation with new vigor. “Old” Europeans – the Germans especially – would be pressed to abandon their détente with Moscow. A resentful Georgia would become chronically anti-Russian, thus ensuring a long-term American presence in the region.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">In the event, like the Ukrainian army today, the Georgian army performed so poorly that a military <em>fait accompli</em> was out of its reach. Excesses against Ossetian civilians – just like the shelling of schools in Slavyansk today – made the “victim of aggression” narrative hard to sell, Obama’s “aggression” rhetoric notwithstanding.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“The question we face… is not whether America will lead but how we will lead, not just to secure our peace and prosperity but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It is unclear how, if at all, America will secure her own “peace and prosperity” in the years and decades to come, let alone how she can extend it “around the globe.” If this is a statement of Obama’s grand strategy, it is flawed in principle and unfeasible in detail. In this statement there is not a hint of an overall blueprint for action that matches our country’s resources to her vital interests. A sound grand strategy enables a state to deploy its political, military, economic, and moral resources in a balanced and proportionate manner, in order to protect and enhance its security and promote its well-being, never mind “the globe.” In Obama’s universe, however, there are no brains behind “indispensable,” heavy-handed diplomacy and military power. Obama creates a false dilemma (“the question we face”) unsupported by facts. China, India, Russia, the Muslim world and Latin America do not want to be “led,” quite the contrary. Old Europe is reluctant at best. Subsaharan Africa is an irrelevant mess. <em>The question we face</em> is not global leadership, but national survival.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“Regional aggression that goes unchecked, whether in southern Ukraine or the South China Sea or anywhere else in the world, will ultimately impact our allies, and could draw in our military. We can’t ignore what happens beyond our boundaries.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">This simultaneous dig at Russia and China reflects a hubristic world view that is unmatched by conflict-management resources. A sane American relationship with Moscow demands acceptance that Russia has legitimate interests in her “near-abroad.” Obama’ four-nation tour of East Asia last Aprilescalated existing U.S. military commitments to the region, created some new ones, deeply irritated China, and emboldened American allies and clients to play hardball with Beijing. Obama does not understand that it is extremely dangerous for a great power to alienate two of its nearest rivals simultaneously. The crisis in Ukraine is going on, but the situation in Asia is potentially more volatile. Dealing with both theaters from the position of presumed strength and trying to dictate the outcomes is perilous, as many would-be hegemons (Philip II, Louis XIV, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, Hitler), blinded by arrogance, have learned to their peril. Obama has continued the hegemonist habit of instigating crises at different spots around the world, even though the resources are scarce and the strategy is fundamentally faulty. An overtly anti-U.S. alliance between Russia and China is now in the making. U.S. overreach led to the emergence of a <em>de facto</em> alliance in the Eurasian Heartland, embodied in the gas deal signed in Shanghai. Russia and China are not natural allies and they may have divergent long-term interests, especially in Central Asia, but they are on the same page when it comes to resisting U.S. hegemony, pardon, “leadership.” In the early 1970’s Dr. Henry Kissinger wisely understood the benefits of an opening to Beijing as a means of pressuring Moscow on the Cold War’s central front. Back then the USSR was far more powerful than the People’s Republic. Today, by contrast, China is much more economically and demographically powerful than Russia, and for the United States the optimal strategy would dictate being on good terms with the weaker party in the triangle. America does not have a policymaker of Kissinger’s stature today, who would understand the potential of a long-term understanding with Moscow as a tool of curtailing Chinese ambitions along the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“America must always lead on the world stage. If we don’t, no one else will. The military that you have joined is, and always will be, the backbone of that leadership.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">The notion that “the world stage” demands a “leader” is flawed. It is at fundamental odds with the balance-of-power paradigm, which has historically secured the longest periods of peace and unprecedented prosperity to the civilized world. Today’s world is being multipolarized, whether Obama the Exceptionalist likes that or not. The very idea of the self-awarded “world leadership” would appear absurd in the days of Bismarck or Metternich. Washington has neither the resources nor the minds for such a role, even if it were called for.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;"><em>“The United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it &#8212; when our people are threatened; when our livelihoods are at stake; when the security of our allies is in danger.”</em></p>
<p style="color: #494949;">None of the above applied in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, or Libya… but enough of Obama. There was more rhetoric at West Point, including an ode to American exceptionalism and further references to America’s global leadership, but it just as tedious, vacuous and intellectually wanting as the first ten minutes of his address.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Overall, it is evident that the United States in Barack Obama’s final term has not given up the hegemonist habit of instigating crises at different spots around the world, even though the management resources are scarce and the strategy is fundamentally faulty. An overtly anti-U.S. alliance between Russia and China is now in the making. It will be a belated equivalent of the Franco-Russian alliance of 1893 – the predictable result of an earlier great power, Wilhelm’s Kaiserreich, basing its strategy on hubristic overestimation of its capabilities. U.S. overreach has led to the emergence of a <em>de facto</em> alliance in the Eurasian Heartland, embodied in last month’s energy agreement signed in Shanghai. Russia and China are not natural allies and they may have divergent long-term interests, especially in Central Asia, but they are on the same page when it comes to resisting U.S. hegemony.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">In the early 1970’s Dr. Henry Kissinger wisely understood the benefits of an opening to Beijing as a means of pressuring Moscow on the Cold War’s central front. Back then the USSR was far more powerful than the People’s Republic. Today, by contrast, China is much more economically and demographically powerful than Russia, and for the United States the optimal strategy would dictate being on good terms with the weaker party in the triangle. It is unfortunate that America does not have a policymaker of Kissinger’s stature today, who would understand the potential of a long-term understanding with Moscow as a tool of curtailing Chinese ambitions along the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Judging by the West Point address, for the remaining two and a half years of Obama’s term U.S.-initiated global confrontations will continue as before. Instead of de-escalating the bloody mess to which she has made a hefty contribution, Victoria Nuland will continue encouraging her blood-soaked protégés in Kiev to seek a military end-game in the East. Instead of calming the South China Sea, Washington will continue encouraging its clients to be impertinent. And Putin and Xi will draw their conclusions: that they do have a powerful common enemy, a rogue regime not amenable to reason or rational calculus.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It cannot be otherwise, considering the Obama Administration’s 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, which is but a rehash of the strategic assumptions of the Bush era. In Obama’s words from two years ago, our “enduring national interest” is to maintain the unparalleled U.S. military superiority, “ready for the full range of contingencies and threats” amid “a complex and growing array of security challenges across the globe.” The Guidance itself asserts that the task of the United States is to “confront and defeat aggression anywhere in the world.” This is not a grand strategy but a blueprint for disaster—especially when combined with the interventionists’ urge to “confront and defeat” not only aggression as such but also “aggression” resulting from  internal conflicts irrelevant to the American interest (Syria, Ukraine) and putative threats to regional stability (Iran).</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Obama is a more reluctant interventionist than McCain or Romney would have been, but he, too, does not recognize the limits of American power and does not correlate that power with this country’s security and prosperity. He fails to balance military and nonmilitary, short and long-term capabilities. He rejects the fact that the world is becoming multipolar again, while the relative power of the United States is in steady decline. Obama’s absence of a viable grand strategy produces policies that are disjointed, nonsensical, and self-defeating. He is prone, no less than his predecessor, to equate any stated political objective in some faraway land with America’s vital interests, without ever offering a coherent definition of those “vital” interests.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">On both sides of the duopoly, the ideology of American exceptionalism and the doctrine of global dominance reign supreme. At a time of domestic economic weakness and cultural decline, foreign policy based on the American interest requires prudence, restraint, and a rational link between ends and means. Abroad, it demands disengagement from distant countries of which we know little; at home, a sane immigration policy.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">It will not happen.</p>

<p>The damaging of Iran&#8217;s centrifuges through the Stuxnet virus a year or so back can only be considered an act of war (certainly the Iranians see it that way!). Is the President authorized to commit acts of war against Iran? I have yet to meet any foreign policy wonk who thinks so. The closest thing to an &#8220;authorization to use military force (AUMF)&#8221; they can come up with is Article 2 of the Constitution. All I find there is the vesting of executive power in the President and the naming him &#8220;Commander in Chief&#8221;. The article goes on to state the President shall &#8220;from time to time&#8221; recommend to the &#8220;Consideration&#8221; of Congress &#8220;such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient&#8221; (This in contradistinction to the explicit right of Congress to declare war in Article 1).</p>
<p>Only a constitutional lawyer of John Yoo&#8217;s caliber could take this to mean President Obama (or Bush, under whom it all started) is authorized to commit acts of war against Iran. But I have heard of no move to hold the president accountable for violating the constitution. Maybe that should yet be considered, as the question of what hostile acts the president is authorized to engage in has assumed a qualitatively larger dimension with the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. Is Obama authorized to commit acts of war against Russia?</p>
<p>The idea may seem preposterous, but consider this. Even before the confrontation began, back last July, a Russian space launch, which was to place a satellite in orbit as part of Russia&#8217;s attempt to build a global positioning system (GPS) competitive with our own, failed spectacularly while being broadcast live on national TV. Then, in May, another launch carrying a $200 million telecommunications satellite failed. Such failures can hardly be blamed on Russian ineptitude in space technology as we rely on their rocket engines for our own launches, including shuttling astronauts to the International Space Station. By comparison, the European space agency has not suffered a launch failure in 12 years.</p>
<p>Then, in early March, there was a major fire at the largest refinery in Europe, which happens to be in Russia. Here&#8217;s a photo of it:</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/refineryburningrussia3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>At that time, you may recall, Russia&#8217;s annexation of the Crimea appeared imminent. Finally, in late April there was a massive explosion at an ammunition depot in Siberia (There have been a number of ammo dump explosions over the last few years).</p>
<p>Are we committing acts of war against Russia?* Is the president authorized to engage in such hostile acts? Consider that Iranian centrifuges would still be blowing up without the Iranians knowing why or we being aware our government was at war with Iran if the Iranians (with Russian help) hadn&#8217;t discovered the Stuxnet virus. It might be well to press the president on this point before we learn the hard way why the Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, placed the power to declare war exclusively in the hands of the legislative branch.</p>
<p>*If we are, I think I know how we are doing it; but, lest you reclassify me from conspiracy nut to <em>bona fide</em> wacko, I&#8217;ll keep it to myself (just two words: Star Wars).</p>

<p>The top five <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/top-25-us-defense-companies-2012-2?op=1">military contractors</a> by sales are Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumann, General Dynamics and Raytheon. In addition to the Department of Defense allocations, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/black-budget/">top five intelligence agencies</a> that often provide military use applications are the <a href="http://www1.american.edu/salla/Articles/BB-CIA.htm">Central Intelligence Agency</a>, the National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Program and the General Defense Intelligence Program. The actual amount of monies that go into funding off the books secret projects, estimated by Bill Sweetman as cited in the <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-economic-crisis-and-the-pentagon-s-black-budget/23422">Economic Crisis and the Pentagon`s Black Budget</a>, exceeds rational comprehension. <em>&#8220;The Pentagon’s ‘black’ operations, including the intelligence budgets nested inside it, are roughly equal in magnitude to the entire defense budgets of the UK, France or Japan, and ten percent of the total.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Even the Washington Post in the account, <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2013/08/black-budget-details-us-operations-goals">&#8220;Black Budget&#8221; details U.S. operations, goals</a> reports the &#8220;Spending in the most recent cycle surpassed that amount based on the $52.6 billion detailed in documents obtained by The Post, plus a separate $23 billion devoted to intelligence programs that more directly support the U.S. military.&#8221;So where did this figure come from? None other than the audacious whistleblower or infamous traitor, depending on your viewpoint, revealed the figures. In the article, <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/08/31/snowden-reveals-first-ever-public-disclosure-of-secret-black-budget-programs/">Snowden Reveals First Ever Public Disclosure Of Secret Black Budget Programs</a>, the costs may be in the trillions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Washington Post revealed that the &#8220;black-budget&#8221; documents report a staggering 52.6 billion dollars that was set aside for operations in the fiscal year 2013. Although it’s great to have this type of documentation in the public domain proving the existence of these black budget programs, the numbers seem to be off according to some statements made by some very prominent people who have been involved in the defense sector for years. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that these programs are not using billions of dollars, but trillions of dollars that are unaccounted for.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Almost makes you believe that when <a href="http://www.infowars.com/rumsfeld-says-2-3-trillion-never-lost-just-untracked/">Rumsfeld Says $2.3 Trillion Never Lost, Just Untracked</a>, he might have actually been telling the truth for once.</p>

<p>See for Yourself: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/02/pentagons-black-budget/">The Pentagon’s $51 Billion ‘Black’ Budget</a> provides some astounding details of the way the &#8220;Black Operations&#8221; system works.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Pentagon likes to play a little hide and seek with its black budget. Projects with code names like the Navy’s &#8220;RETRACT JUNIPER&#8221; and &#8220;LINK PLUMERIA&#8221; are simple enough to find in the <a href="http://comptroller.defense.gov/defbudget/fy2012/fy2012_r1.pdf">research development, testing and evaluation budget (.pdf)</a>. As are many of the Army’s &#8220;TRACTOR&#8221; projects: &#8220;TRACTOR NAIL,&#8221; &#8220;TRACTOR CAGE,&#8221; and so on. But then comes along a project like &#8220;TRACTOR DESK&#8221; hiding in one of the Army’s eight research budget documents, while others find their way to the operations and maintenance and procurement budgets.These projects are also where to go when searching for what’s getting cut. Something called the &#8220;Classified Program USD(P),&#8221; formerly valued around a respectable $100 million, had its budget reduced to zero. &#8220;TRACTOR JUTE&#8221; is on life support and &#8220;COBRA JUDY&#8221; had the sting taken out of it.</p>
<p>Most other projects saw lesser cuts, however, and others like &#8220;RETRACT MAPLE&#8221; even saw minor gains. This is also while the researcher <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/02/darpa-budget-death-ray//lmore-72646%20">at Darpa only received a slight trim</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like the KISS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep to simple, stupid</a>) principle did not make it into the budget.Now take a high profile program that surely excites the imagination, even if it strains the pocketbook.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.defenceaviation.com/2013/11/lockheed-martin-sr-72-specification-technical-data.html">Lockheed Martin SR-72 Specification &amp; Technical Data</a>, might just be another cover-up project designed to conceal the actual replacement for the SR-71 (<a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/mystery/aurora.htm">Aurora</a>) rumored to be flying for decades.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Lockheed Martin SR-72 is a conceptualized unmanned, hypersonic aircraft intended for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance proposed by Lockheed Martin to succeed the retired SR-71 Blackbird. The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird has been overtaken by it’s successor, The SR-72, the fastest Aircraft ever built. According to Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, the SR-72, has a twin-engine aircraft which is designed in such a way that it can fly at Mach 6. By 2018, the SR-72 could be up for demonstration showing off at the high-speed strike weapon (HSSW), a U.S. hypersonic missile program taking shape under the Air Force and Darpa.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div>All these covert platforms are so secret that the complete disclosure is above the pay grade of most elected representatives. <a href="http://www.openminds.tv/breaking-down-the-black-budget/11263">Breaking down the Black Budget</a> alludes to the SAPS. Seemingly, a most appropriate slang name; - a fool, dupe - befitting government puppets.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to Ben Rich (Lockheed Skunk Works director 1975-1991), keeping programs secret can add anywhere from 10 to 15% to the overall cost . . . Within the murky world of secret defense projects there are three main categories: SAP’s (Special Access Program), USAP (Unacknowledged Special Access Program), and so called &#8220;Waived SAPS&#8221;. In the case of waived SAP’s, their existence is not known by Congress or possibly the President.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<div>So where does the money come from for the military to develop and build their play toys weapons of mass destruction? <a href="https://solari.com/blog/coming-clean-beyond-the-fiscal-cliff-black-budget-8th-of-22-challenges/">Catherine Austin Fitts</a>, answers with the claim that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The black budget has numerous sources. First, there is funding allocated in secret by Congressional &#8220;oversight&#8221; committees. Second, there are funds clawed from other agency appropriations. Third there are an endless series of other sources of funding include seizures, proceeds from the marketing of hard narcotics and engineering of mortgage and other financial fraud in your community and from many other illicit businesses operated globally by the intelligence cartel. Finally, I suspect one of the largest sources and uses has become market manipulations through the Exchange Stabilization Fund.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Somewhere along the way, genuine national defense is short-changed, even if one’s political views support the policy of imperium hegemony. The dominance of the <a href="http://www.batr.org/corporatocracy/021914.html">military-industrial-complex</a> comes not from their firepower systems, but from the ability to perpetuate a never-ending warfare society, based upon phony threats and a permanent aggressor interventionism and empire expansion.The corporatists love this cash cow because killing fellow humans is the most profitable business in all of history. Keeping this fact hidden from the taxpayer is the ultimate black budget blueprint that needs protection for the Corporatocracy to continue.</p>

</div>
<p>A 1928 book entitled “Propaganda” by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernayshttp:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays" target="_blank">Edward Bernays</a> begins with these words. “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.  Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.”</p>
<p>“We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized.  Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society.”</p>
<p>“Our invisible governors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet.”  Pg. 9</p>
<p>He continues: “Some of the phenomena of this process are criticized—the manipulation of news, the inflation of personality, and the general ballyhoo by which politicians and commercial products and social ideas are brought to the consciousness of the masses. The instruments by which public opinion is organized and focused may be misused. But such organization and focusing are necessary to orderly life.”</p>
<p>“As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increasingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented.” Pg. 12</p>
<p>Bernays lived to see a practical application of his ideas in the government of the United States of America.  Born in 1891 he died in 1995 at the age of 103.  His brand of Talmudist humanistic government is the guiding light of our current society.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School" target="_blank">The Frankfort School</a> enhanced Bernays’ totalitarian model with an equally onerous Communism.  With the same geographic German roots Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Pollock, Fromm, Lowenthal, and others fled Hitler’s oppressive regime and sang their song of tyranny in American intellectual circles.</p>
<p>Similar authoritarianism were envisioned by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Strauss" target="_blank">University of Chicago professor Leo Strauss</a> whose students included an array of  movers and shakers (Justice Clarence Thomas; Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; former Assistant Secretary of State Alan Keyes; former Secretary of Education William Bennett; Weekly Standard editor and former Quayle Chief of Staff William Kristol; Allan Bloom, former New York Post editorials editor John Podhoretz; and former National Endowment for the Humanities Deputy Chairman John T. Agresto) who often damned Constitutional freedoms in favor of war and conquest.</p>
<p>R. J. Rushdoony’s writings emphasize the inevitable development of the tyrannical state as the ultimate authority in humanistic societies.  Instead of deriving order from the immutable dictates of the Creator, humanism leaves the creature with an anarchic, goalless absurdity.  Tyranny is the only solution to mutable human opinion. Governments that evade responsibility to the Creator soon become despotic.</p>
<p>Humanism is not confined to totalitarian governments it is just as prominent and even more deadly in religious organizations.  The Protestant Christian Church began its steep slide with the idea that “free will” allowed the creature to decide whether or not it would accept the Will of the Creator.  Arminianism copies the original sin recorded In Genesis 3. The Bible describes a God Who is sovereign and Who both selects and enables His subjects.  Humanism had grown like a cancer in the Christian Church allowing so called Christians to function as humanists while claiming the Name of Christ.</p>
<p>Several doctrines common in the Catholic Church are equally humanistic.  The Church of Jesus Christ has no authority to forgive sin or to confer salvation; both are reserved to God alone.  The Bible contains no injunction to pray to Mary or to any other human figure the church might designate. This contradicts the Biblical mandate and is blasphemous.</p>
<p>Judaism is rife with human error that began with the Pharisees in the time of Christ and has continued to grow and fester.  God’s Word contained in the Torah has been replaced with the words of men in the Talmud where Rabbis override the voice of the Creator with sly rebuttals and ameliorate sin with absurd excuses.  The apartheid Talmud, a humanistic guide to the Torah, rules the behavior of the powerful U. S. Jewish community.</p>
<p>Sincere subjugation to the Living God and attentive obedience to His Word is anathema to the prideful heathens that control the world.  The arrogance that results from human hegemony is forcing dissonant evil on a world of confused and sinful people.  Homosexuality, gay marriage, abortion, porn, imperialistic war, murder, torture, legal theft, judicial injustice, and rampant mendacity have all become entrenched in our society.</p>
<p>R. J. Rushdoony writes: “The alternative to the sovereignty, government, and providence of the triune God is in practice the sovereignty, government, and providence of church state or some agency of man.  It means freedom from God for the slavery of sin and rebellion.  The man who is in revolt against God’s reign will soon be the slave, not only of sin, but of apostate institutions, churches, states, families , men, women, and children.  For such a slave, freedom is intolerable.  As a young Nazi boasted before WWII, ‘We are free of freedom.’ “   “Systematic Theology” Pg. 211-212</p>
<p>The passage reminded me of my estranged daughter who along with her husband and five grandchildren left the family, sold their home and all their possessions and moved into a cult.  They had a fine marriage and were excellent parents but they struggled to make a living and to find an outlet for their Christianity.</p>
<p>They were always happy to receive help but they regularly ignored advice.  Their failure to cope with the responsibilities of freedom was a product of their own rebellion and now they live and work under the control of others.</p>
<p>Slavery has been demonized in our society but it is not always bad.  There are those who prefer to delegate their freedom and will work for those who assume responsibility.</p>
<p>When Bernays refers to “the masses” he uses an impersonal derogation to describe the population that failed to ascend into the elite structure.  Today, that would be the 99 percent who are under the rule of a shadowy elite one percent.</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact that our Constitution was crafted in secret by a group of leading citizens.  It was designed to provide freedom to the population through rule of the people by the people.  It was a sterling concept but it had a fatal flaw:  Authority was vested in citizens who do not have the ability to properly govern themselves</p>
<p>Governments that are not bound to God’s Law will always become tyrannical.  Libertarians seek a minimum of government intrusion – some seek none.  They come close to the Christian concept which is miniscule.  But since humans were not created to govern themselves they require an overarching authority.  God’s model has the entire creation under His mandates.  His model provides maximum freedom for both the leaders and the people. It offers an absolute legal code that cannot be amended.  Without this immutable anchor for all of God’s creatures tyranny will continue.</p>
<p>“The providence of God is little spoken of today, because His powers of government have been transferred to the state and to man, together with His sovereignty.  It is the stare that today preaches providence to willing congregations, calling it cradle to grave for (or womb to tomb) care, social security, and a variety of other names.  Men everywhere believe in providence, and they look to their gods to it. Unhappily, their gods are false gods, and not the living Lord.”  R. J. Rushdoony  “Systematic Theology”, Vol 1, Pg. 211</p>

			<p><em>Jewish Quarter, the Old City, Damascus&#8230;</em></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/EliyahuHanabidamascus3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>It’s always encouraging when one comes upon some inspiring human enterprise, here in Syria or elsewhere, that refutes the worn shibboleths and clichés about how this or that group, or this or that religion, hates others and won’t cease targeting them until they are destroyed and burning in Hell.</p>
<p>In Syria today there is much evidence to refute the claims, often politically motivated, that Jewish cultural heritage sites are being singled out for destruction by rabid anti-Semites. One example of this is the Eliyahu Hanabi Synagogue in the neighborhood of Jobar, on the outskirts of Damascus. For centuries, Jobar has been inhabited by a peaceful, mixed community of Muslims, Christians, and Jews, many of whom often attended events together at the synagogue.</p>
<p>Reports this week in Zionist media about the destruction of the 400-year-old (not <em>2000</em>-year-old, as claimed, erroneously, by one report in Israeli media) synagogue, along with the loss of all its contents, are similar to reports over the past three years which turned out to be patently false. This observer has been waiting for clearance to visit the site, to learn exactly what happened there this week, to assess its current condition and inventory its religious artifacts, which comprise part of Syria’s, and humanity’s, collective heritage.</p>
<p>One of the more virulent charges to come forth this week, particularly from the colonial Zionist regime occupying Palestine, is the mantra of ‘see what the hatred of those Arabs for the Jewish people has done.’ Admittedly it’s an effective fund-raising mechanism—as well as a handy intimidation tool—for the Zionist lobby, as it scrabbles to retain control of the US government and American public sentiment, a public which seems to be growing increasingly vexed by the lobby’s actions and which are finally pulling back from rubber-stamping the crimes of the apartheid regime.</p>
<p>Jobar is a suburb of Damascus, and location-wise the Eliyahu Hanabi Synagogue (measuring approximately 17 meters long by 15.7 meters wide) sits undeniably at a crossroads, in an area that has been occupied by rebel forces since the beginning of the Syrian conflict—which means it was sure to get damaged. With each shelling of the district over the past three years, claims were made that the synagogue had been destroyed by government forces. One such report, published on April fool’s day in 2013 by the Times of Israel and widely circulated by Zionist media outlets, claimed that, “The 2,000-year-old Jobar Synagogue in the Syrian capital of Damascus—the country’s holiest Jewish site—was looted and burned to the ground by government forces.” The report was patently false but got spread far and wide, despite the fact that there have been no government forces in Jobar since the conflict began. Two copy-cat reports followed later in 2013, but they were equally false. Nearly a year later, however, in March of 2014, media reports conceded that the synagogue was still standing, with only minor damage, and that its contents appeared to be in good condition.</p>
<p>This observer has received credible reports about certain stolen artifacts, including gold chandeliers, from the Eliyahu Hanabi Synagogue being offered for sale. It is well known in Syria that certain militia and other opportunists have been financing themselves by selling this country’s cultural heritage whenever and wherever they get the opportunity. There is in fact a multi-million-dollar black market in this type of illicit trade. Security agencies in Syria, in coordination with INTERPOL, have been alerted to the thefts of Jewish property, just as with thefts of other antiquities, and they periodically issue what are referred to as “watch for and confiscate” lists of stolen artifacts.</p>
<p>It is <em>not</em> true…based upon this observer’s many personal experiences in Syria…that Arabs hate Jews, although they would have plenty of reasons to, or that animosities between the two peoples are irreversible and irretrievable, and the reason I say this is that increasingly, in the Middle East as well as globally, people are beginning to distinguish between Jews as individuals (as “people of the book” and basically more or less like the rest of us) and fascist Zionism—an ideology being exposed as the greatest enemy and threat to Jews everywhere.</p>
<p>The latest, but so far unverified, information received by this observer from rebel sources claiming to have “contacts” in the Jobar Synagogue indicate that some early 20<sup>th</sup> century artifacts, including gold chandeliers and icons, were stolen early on in the conflict, and also that the area surrounding the synagogue has been shelled sporadically over the past nearly two years, resulting in modest damage to the exterior walls. This information was obtained as of last month. Conditions may well have changed this week. Other Syrian sources indicate that there has been interior damage with some scattered rubble in the nave and prayer rooms of the temple. But there has been no confirmation to claims of thousands of manuscripts, including Bibles, being looted from Jobar. On the contrary, many documents, including Bibles and other artifacts, were transferred by the local Jobar Council, with the full cooperation of the Syrian government, to an Ottoman-era synagogue in the Old City of Damascus for safe keeping. The location, which this observer has visited and where many Jobar Synagogue artifacts are today in storage, is one of six areas in Syria currently listed on the World Heritage List of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The site currently has round-the-clock government security that continues to guard the Old City of Damascus. It is also one of the 11 synagogues that President Assad had promised in 2011 to repair and restore, but alas that’s a project that the rebellion has put on hold.</p>
<p>In light of all the unverified claims about the synagogue in Jobar, one is reminded again of the decade-long US/UK War against Iraq and the false reporting about what happened at certain archaeological sites in that country. Specifically we might recall the Iraqi Jewish artifacts that Ahmad Chalabi claimed he was able to ‘rescue’ for the Coalition Provisional Authority. Chalabi, of the ill-fated Iraqi National Congress, along with the Bush administration’s Coalition Provisional Authority, sought to gain some much needed good press for himself and pals Richard Perle, Nathan Sharansky, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, this after April 2003 reports of thousands of priceless ancient artifacts being looted from Iraqi museums. The war planners were being castigated for their failure to protect Iraq’s cultural treasures, and it soon became clear that some of Chalabi’s pronouncements regarding the fate of Jewish artifacts were false and politically self-serving. Discredited, Chalabi’s party did not win any seats in the December 2005 election.</p>
<p>Some suspect similar political grandstanding motives in the current reports about Jobar, and it may be a while before credible eyewitness accounts from the scene are gathered. At that point we will we know the truth about the fate of the Eliyahu Hanabi Synagogue and the whole of Jobar. A delegation, including a Jewish representative from Damascus as well as this observer, has been trying to visit the area, but armed conflict and the continued occupation of the synagogue by rebels has prevented us so far from gaining entry.</p>
<p>What’s important to note, though, is that the people of Syria and their government have made herculean efforts to avoid what happened in Iraq, and to assure the preservation of their global cultural heritage, of which Jewish antiquities is an important pillar. One example of these efforts is the fascinating case of the Dura-Europos Synagogue, discovered in 1932.</p>
<p>The synagogue in Dura Europos had survived in such good condition because of its location, near a small Roman garrison on the Euphrates River. Parts of the building, which abutted the main city wall, were requisitioned by the Roman army and filled with sand as a defensive measure against northern and eastern marauders. The city was abandoned after Rome’s fall, never to be resettled, and the lower walls of the rooms remained buried and largely intact until excavated. The archaeological dig discovered many Jewish wall-paintings and also Christian texts written in Hebrew. Especially interesting perhaps was the discovery of paintings in the synagogue depicting limited aspects of Mithraism, a religion practiced in the Roman Empire between the first and 4<sup>th</sup> centuries and that was especially popular within the ranks of the Roman legions. Named for the Persian god Mithra, many Syrians followed the cult, as did some Roman senators who resisted the ‘new’ Christianity.</p>
<p>Itemized in the list below are specific Jewish-Syrian antiquities, including Old-Testament-themed paintings, this observer has verified as being under protection. Keep in mind, these are only a few examples, among many thousands, that I have been advised appear to be in excellent condition as of late May 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Torah niche from the ancient Synagogue of Dura Europos on which are drawings of the Prophet Abraham, including the scene of his offering his son. Also beside them a drawing of the candle stick and the temple façade.</li>
<li>A drawing featuring the Prophet Ezra reading a papyrus, Prophet Moses in the flames of boxthorn, the Ark of the Covenant in the hands of Philistines, and David anointed as a king by Samuel.</li>
<li>A number of paintings with themes from the Old Testament</li>
<li>A drawing of the pharaoh and Moses as a child, and a beautiful painting of Abraham between the two symbols of the sun and the moon.</li>
<li>A drawing representing the story of Mordechai and Esther and Elijah bringing life back to a baby.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the current and legitimate focus on Jobar, the record of the Syrian people on preserving their cultural heritage, especially during the current crisis, is admirable. Two weeks ago this observer visited the old city of Homs, and spent a fair bit of time at the Um Al-Zenar Church of Saint Mary, <em>Church of the Holy Belt,</em> which dates from 52 AD. Tradition has it that this seat of the Syriac Orthodox archbishopric contains a venerated relic, and indeed the Bishop spoke to me about it one day as he shoveled rubble from around the altar. The relic is claimed to be a section of the belt of St. Mary, the mother of Jesus, and is said to be hidden near a below-ground spring. One arrives at the spring by walking down a long, very narrow, pitch black set of stone steps. The Holy Water that can be found there, a small pond in essence, is filled with fragments of stone and wood chunks from the fighting, yet supposedly this water has curative powers. I scooped up a couple of handfuls, and it was indeed very refreshing, but did nothing, so far, to cure my leg problem.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, this observer was struck by the number of parishioners, along with volunteers from the neighborhood, mostly Muslims, covered in dust and soot as they worked at cleaning out the rubble. In the courtyard in front of the church this observer stoked a still smoldering heap of burned bibles and other church documents and icons which I was told rebels had torched as they prepared to vacate the compound earlier this month. Two days after I departed Homs, the Um Al-Zenar Church, though a partially burned out shell devoid of pews and religious artifacts, held its first Holy Communion since the conflict began.</p>
<p>From my experience, Syrians, without exception, are deeply connected with their cultural heritage and do not distinguish all that much among its origins. Many Syrians are proud to help others protect and rebuild their damaged religious and cultural sites, and in fact it seems to be a unifying factor among this besieged population. People this observer speaks with as he travels around Syria to visit archeological sites seem to blame both sides for the damage, but they tend to focus more on the task of restoring their heritage sites. Space does not allow me to enumerate the countless examples of this, but I will mention one.</p>
<p>This observer was served tea one day by some members of the Jewish community in the old City of Damascus, including my friend Saul, who claims to be the last Jewish tailor in Syria, as well as the lovely elderly ladies known as ‘the Jewish sisters’ and whose apartment is near where St. Paul, according to tradition, converted to Christianity. The view expressed by my hosts that day—and I believe them—is that Jewish cultural heritage in Syria is being respected, protected and preserved with the same care as Muslim, Christian, and pagan antiquities.</p>

			<p><em>“I liken the economy to a car on a flat road that has no momentum. When you take your foot off the gas, the car just stops moving.”</em> — Stephanie Pomboy, Interview Barron’s</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Not-the-Economy-3.jpg"  /></p>
</div>
<p>If you follow the stock market, you probably think the economy is sizzling. But if bonds are your thing, then you probably think we’re still in recession.</p>
<p>So which is the better gauge of what’s going on in the real economy; stocks or bonds?</p>
<p>The bond market is more accurate. And recently, long-term yields have been dropping like a stone which is not a good sign for the economy. Investors seem to think that slow growth and low inflation are here to stay, and they could be right. According to Bloomberg, “Falling yields on longer-term Treasuries historically reflect periods of lackluster growth. Since 1960, they have predicted seven of the last eight recessions when 10-year yields fell below 3-month bill rates.” As of today, the benchmark 10-year UST is a dismal 2.44 percent.</p>
<p>The reason investors have been piling back into Treasuries is because is the labor market is weak and there’s no sign of inflation anywhere. When wages stagnate and incomes drop–as they have since the slump ended– then there’s no upward pressure on prices because everyone is making less dough, so there’s less demand, less growth and, hence, less inflation. Of course, Obama could have fixed the situation by holding off on slashing the deficits or by increasing the amount of stimulus in his fiscal package. That would have circulated more money into the economy boosting employment and revving up growth. But that would have put the economy back on its feet again which was not what he wanted. What he wanted was to grind working people into the ground by keeping the economy on life-support while his chiseling Wall Street buddies made out like bandits on the latest stock market bubble. The Wall Street Journal explains what’s going on:</p>
<p>“Bond yields are – once again – plunging worldwide. The reason for this revived buying among fixed-income investors is that central banks are – once again – signaling their intent to ease monetary conditions in yet another bid to kick-start sluggish economies and forestall a downward spiral in prices, or deflation. The prospect that central banks will continue to inject money into the world’s bond markets…has acted as a green light for the world’s bond buyers.”</p>
<p>So investors think the Fed will have to taper the “Taper” and start buying more government paper. But why?</p>
<p>Because they have no choice. Many of the usual buyers of US Treasuries have cut back on their monthly purchases or stopped buying altogether. That means that rates will have to rise to attract more buyers unless the Fed makes up the difference. Check out this blurb from Barron’s interview with Stephanie Pomboy:</p>
<p>“Foreigners are buying about $10 billion a month of Treasuries. This compares with deficit financing needs for the U.S. government of roughly $40 billion a month, based on this year’s deficit. So the Fed needs to pick up roughly $30 billion a month in slack. When the Fed slashed its buying to $25 billion, effective this month, it for the first time opened up a demand deficit for Treasuries. If they continue to taper, that gap will expand, and things could get bumpy in the Treasury market. Rates won’t go up five basis points before the Fed would start talking about more QE.” (<a href="http://acrossthecurve.com/?p=14148">Barrons Interview Posits Weak US Economy</a>, Barron’s)</p>
<p>It’ll get bumpy alright, real bumpy. Higher rates will send housing and stocks into freefall. The Fed will have no choice but to step in to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>The economy is already suffering from chronic lack of demand. Add higher rates to the mix, and cost-conscious consumers are going to cut back on everything from auto loans to nights-on-the-town. Yellen’s not going to let that happen. She’s going to come up with some cockamamie excuse for buying more USTs and hope-like-hell that wages and incomes rebound so she can start tapering again.</p>
<p>This illustrates the conceptual flaw in Central Bank policy. QE and zero rates are supposed to reduce the price of money, thereby enticing consumers to take out loans and spend like crazy. That, in turn, is supposed to generate more activity and stronger growth. But there’s a slight glitch to this theory, that is, consumers aren’t the brain-dead lab rats the Fed thinks they are. Most people don’t base their spending decisions on price alone. Sometimes, for example, it doesn’t make sense to borrow money no matter how cheap it is. The average working stiff doesn’t give a rip if he can get a loan at 3.5 percent when his credit card is already maxed out and the only job he can find is working graveyard at Jack in the Box. That guy doesn’t need more debt, he needs a decent paying job. Here’s how the managing partner of MBMG Group, Paul Gambles explained the phenom in an interview on CNBC:</p>
<p>“People and businesses are not inclined to borrow money during a downturn purely because it is made cheaper to do so. Consumers also need a feeling of job security and confidence in the economy before taking on additional borrowing commitments.” (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/contributed/2014-05-13/obvious-reason-qe-doesnt-work">Washington’s blog</a> via Zero Hedge)</p>
<p>Bingo. Of course, the members of the Fed know that this whole “cheap money” thing is bogus, but they keep reiterating the same blather so they can keep the wampum flowing to their crooked friends on Wall Street. It’s worth noting that: since the end of the recession, “one-third of all income increases in this country went to just 16,000 households, 95 percent of it went to the top 1 percent, and the bottom 90 percent’s incomes fell, and they fell by 15 percent.”</p>
<p>In other words, the Fed knows exactly how QE works, (and who benefits) and it has nothing to do with extending credit to working people. That’s malarkey. It’s all about providing limitless liquidity for financial speculators so they can send stocks into the stratosphere and rake in record profits. Here’s a blurb from a piece by Zero Hedge that helps to illustrate what’s going on:</p>
<p>“According to the most recent CapitalIQ data, the single biggest buyer of stocks in the first quarter were none other than the companies of the S&amp;P500 itself, which cumulatively repurchased a whopping $160 billion of their own stock in the first quarter!</p>
<p>Should the Q1 pace of buybacks persist into Q2 which has just one month left before it too enters the history books, the LTM period as of June 30, 2014 will be the greatest annual buyback tally in market history.” (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-27/here-mystery-and-completely-indiscriminate-buyer-stocks-first-quarter">Here Is The Mystery, And Completely Indiscriminate, Buyer Of Stocks In The First Quarter</a>, Zero Hedge)</p>
<p>Why are companies buying shares of their own stock, you ask, when buybacks add no productive value to a company at all?</p>
<p>It’s because it gooses stock prices which makes shareholders happy. It’s a complete scam. And it’s a huge scam, too. Currently, total stock buybacks represent a whopping $4 trillion or 20 percent of the total stock market value. Just think of the walloping prices are going to take when these same shareholders decide it’s time to bail out? Look out below!</p>
<p>Now get a load of this clip from Action Forex:</p>
<p>“Disappointment over the pace of economic growth explains at least some of the downturn in yields. The U.S. economy very likely contracted in the first quarter of the year, perhaps by as much as 1.0% annualized … Even with a strong bounce back in the second quarter … – the average pace of growth in the first half of the year will be a tepid 2.0%, about the pace it’s been since the end of the recession…</p>
<p>The retrenchment in yields also reflects events abroad … However, there is perhaps another reason for the decline in yields that is more pernicious. There is the realization that even after the recovery has run its course, economic growth is likely to be slower than it has been in the past. Slower growth means that as the fed funds rate eventually moves off the floor, it will not go back to the 5.25% it was prior to the Great Recession or even the 4.0% it averaged over the quarter of a decade prior. Expectations of “lower forever”…increasingly appear to be built into longer-term interest rates.” (<a href="http://www.actionforex.com/analysis/weekly-forex-fundamentals/the-weekly-bottom-line-20140524216260/">A year in the bond market</a>, Action Forex)</p>
<p>Did you catch that part about “lower forever”?</p>
<p>What the author means is that the economy has reset at a lower level of activity and will not return to normal. This is an admission that the managers of the system have no intention of fixing what’s wrong; cleaning up the banks, writing down the debts, regulating the system, increasing workers buying power (boosting demand) or providing sustained fiscal stimulus until unemployment and growth are back where they should be. Instead, basic macro has been replaced with public relations, that is, a swindle that’s spearheaded by faux-liberal icons Krugman and Summers who are pushing the “secular stagnation” folderol which is just a lame excuse for maintaining the status quo plus a few anemic add-ons, like infrastructure projects. Big whoop. It’s all a fig leaf for maintaining the same wealth shifting monetary policies that are in place today.</p>
<p>So this is it? Are we really doomed to a future of high unemployment and slow growth?</p>
<p>The IMF seems to think so. Here’s an excerpt from an article by Nick Beams which gives a rundown on a recent IMF report that was ignored by the media. The article is titled “No end to economic breakdown”:</p>
<p>“Almost six years after the eruption of the global financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund has effectively ruled out any return to the economic growth rates that preceded September 2008.</p>
<p>Two major chapters of the IMF’s World Economic Outlook … provide a gloomy assessment of the state of the world economy. In the advanced economies, investment is falling as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), while in the “emerging markets,” there is no prospect for growth rates to return to pre-2007 levels.</p>
<p>The IMF notes that real interest rates have been declining since the 1980s and are “now in slightly negative territory.” But this has failed to boost productive investment. On the contrary, what it calls “scars” from the global financial crisis “have resulted in a sharp and persistent decline in investment in advanced economies.” Between 2008 and 2013, there was a two-and-a-half percentage point decline in the investment to GDP ratio in these countries. The report adds that ratios “in many advanced economies are unlikely to recover to pre-crisis levels in the next five years.”</p>
<p>This conclusion is of immense significance given the critical role of investment in the functioning of the capitalist economy … Investment…is the key driving force of capitalist economic growth … But if investment stagnates or declines, the circle turns vicious. This is what is now taking place.” <a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/04/08/pers-a08.html">IMF report: No end to economic breakdown</a> (april), wsws</p>
<p>So no return to normal, after all. The American people are now facing a long period of high unemployment and slow growth that will shrink the middle class and change the country in ways we can hardly imagine. It’s unavoidable. It’s the policy.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: As this piece was going to press, the Wall Street Journal announced that “revised” First Quarter GDP contracted at a 0.6% annual rate. So while stocks have been setting records almost daily due to the massive injections of money from the Fed, the economy is steadily sliding towards recession.</em></p>

</div>
<p>Memorial Day is when we commemorate our war dead. Like the Fourth of July, Memorial Day is being turned into a celebration of war.</p>
<p>Those who lose family members and dear friends to war don’t want the deaths to have been in vain. Consequently, wars become glorious deeds performed by noble soldiers fighting for truth, justice, and the American way. Patriotic speeches tell us how much we owe to those who gave their lives so that America could remain free.</p>
<p>The speeches are well-intentioned, but the speeches create a false reality that supports ever more wars. None of America’s wars had anything to do with keeping America free. To the contrary, the wars swept away our civil liberties, making us unfree.</p>
<p>President Lincoln issued an executive order for the arrest and imprisonment of northern newspaper reporters and editors. He shut down 300 northern newspapers and held 14,000 political prisoners. Lincoln arrested war critic US Representative Clement Vallandigham from Ohio and exiled him to the Confederacy. President Woodrow Wilson used WWI to suppress free speech, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt used WWII to intern 120,000 US citizens of Japanese descent on the grounds that race made them suspect. Professor Samuel Walker concluded that President George W. Bush used the “war on terror” for an across the board assault on US civil liberty, making the Bush regime the greatest danger American liberty has ever faced.</p>
<p>Lincoln forever destroyed states’ rights, but the suspension of habeas corpus and free speech that went hand in hand with America’s three largest wars was lifted at war’s end. However, President George W. Bush’s repeal of the Constitution has been expanded by President Obama and codified by Congress and executive orders into law. Far from defending our liberties, our soldiers who died in “the war on terror” died so that the president can indefinitely detain US citizens without due process of law and murder US citizens on suspicion alone without any accountability to law or the Constitution.</p>
<p>The conclusion is unavoidable that America’s wars have not protected our liberty but, instead, destroyed liberty. As Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, “A state of war only serves as an excuse for domestic tyranny.”</p>
<p>Southern secession did pose a threat to Washington’s <em>empire, but not to the American people.</em>Neither the Germans of WWI vintage nor the Germans and Japanese of WWII vintage posed any threat to the US. As historians have made completely clear, Germany did not start WWI and did not go to war for the purpose of territorial expansion. Japan’s ambitions were in Asia. Hitler did not want war with England and France. Hitler’s territorial ambitions were mainly to restore German provinces stripped from Germany as WWI booty in violation of President Wilson’s guarantees. Any other German ambitions were to the East. Neither country had any plans to invade the US. Japan attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbor hoping to remove an obstacle to its activities in Asia, not as a precursor to an invasion of America.</p>
<p>Certainly the countries ravaged by Bush and Obama in the 21st century–Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Pakistan, and Yemen posed no military threat to the US. Indeed, these were wars used by a tyrannical executive branch to establish the basis of the Stasi State that now exists in the US.</p>
<p>The truth is hard to bear, but the facts are clear. America’s wars have been fought in order to advance Washington’s power, the profits of bankers and armaments industries, and the fortunes of US companies. Marine General Smedley Butler said, “ I served in all commissioned ranks from a second Lieutenant to a Major General. And during that time, I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street, and for the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer for capitalism.”</p>
<p>It is more or less impossible to commemorate the war dead without glorifying them, and it is impossible to glorify them without glorifying their wars.</p>
<p>For the entirety of the 21st century the US has been at war, not war against massed armies or threats to American freedom, but wars against civilians, against women, children, and village elders, and wars against our own liberty. Elites with a vested interest in these wars tell us that the wars will have to go on for another 20 to 30 years before we defeat “the terrorist threat.”</p>
<p>This, of course, is nonsense. There was no terrorist threat until Washington began trying to create terrorists by military attacks, justified by lies, on Muslim populations.</p>
<p>Washington succeeded with its war lies to the point that Washington’s audacity and hubris have outgrown Washington’s judgment.</p>
<p>By overthrowing the democratically elected government in Ukraine, Washington has brought the United States into confrontation with Russia. This is a confrontation that could end badly, perhaps for Washington and perhaps for the entire world.</p>
<p>If Gaddafi and Assad would not roll over for Washington, why does Washington think Russia will? Russia is not Libya or Syria. Washington is the bully who having beat up the kindergarden kid, now thinks he can take on the college linebacker.</p>
<p>The Bush and Obama regimes have destroyed America’s reputation with their incessant lies and violence against other peoples. The world sees Washington as the prime threat.</p>
<p>Worldwide polls consistently show that people around the world regard the US and Israel as the two countries that pose the greatest threat to peace. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/gallup-poll-biggest-threat-world-peace-america-1525008">http://www.ibtimes.com/gallup-poll-biggest-threat-world-peace-america-1525008</a> and<br />
<a href="http://www.jewishfederations.org/european-poll-israel-biggest-threat-to-world-peace.aspx">http://www.jewishfederations.org/european-poll-israel-biggest-threat-to-world-peace.aspx</a></p>
<p>The countries that Washington’s propaganda declares to be “rogue states” and the “axis of evil,” such as Iran and North Korea, are far down the list when the peoples in the world are consulted. It could not be more clear that the world does not believe Washington’s self-serving propaganda. The world sees the US and Israel as the rogue states.</p>
<p>The US and Israel are the only two countries in the world that are in the grip of ideologies. The US is in the grip of the Neoconservative ideology which has declared the US to be the “exceptional, indispensable country” chosen by history to exercise hegemony over all others. This ideology is buttressed by the Brzezinski and Wolfowitz doctrines that are the basis of US foreign policy.</p>
<p>The Israeli government is in the grip of the Zionist ideology that declares a “greater Israel” from the Nile to the Euphrates. Many Israelis themselves do not accept this ideology, but it is the ideology of the “settlers” and those who control the Israeli government.</p>
<p>Ideologies are important causes of war. Just as the Hitlerian ideology of German superiority is mirrored in the Neoconservative ideology of US superiority, the Communist ideology that the working class is superior to the capitalist class is mirrored in the Zionist ideology that Israelis are superior to Palestinians. Zionists have never heard of squatters’ rights and claim that recent Jewish immigrants into Palestine–invaders really–have the right to land occupied by others for millenniums.</p>
<p>Washington’s and Israel’s doctrines of superiority over others do not sit very well with the ”others.” When Obama declared in a speech that Americans are the exceptional people, Russia’s President Putin responded, “God created us all equal.”</p>
<p>To the detriment of its population, the Israeli government has made endless enemies. Israel has effectively isolated itself in the world. Israel’s continued existence depends entirely on the willingness and ability of Washington to protect Israel. This means that Israel’s power is derivative of Washington’s power.</p>
<p>Washington’s power is a different story. As the only economy standing after WWII, the US dollar became the world money. This role for the dollar has given Washington financial hegemony over the world, the main source of Washington’s power. As other countries rise, Washington’s hegemony is imperiled.</p>
<p>To prevent other countries from rising, Washington invokes the Brzezinski and Wolfowitz doctrines. To be brief, the Brzezinski doctrine says that in order to remain the only superpower, Washington must control the Eurasian land mass. Brzezinski is willing for this to occur peacefully by suborning the Russian government into Washington’s empire. ”A loosely confederated Russia . . . a decentralized Russia would be less susceptible to imperial mobilization.” In other words, break up Russia into associations of semi-autonomous states whose politicians can be suborned by Washington’s money.</p>
<p>Brzezinski propounded “a geo-strategy for Eurasia.” In Brzezinski’s strategy, China and “a confederated Russia” are part of a “transcontinental security framework,” managed by Washington in order to perpetuate the role of the US as the world’s only superpower.</p>
<p>I once asked my colleague, Brzezinski, that if everyone was allied with us, who were we organized against? My question surprised him, because I think that Brzezinski remains caught up in Cold War strategy even after the demise of the Soviet Union. In Cold War thinking it was important to have the upper hand or else be at risk of being eliminated as a player. The importance of prevailing became all consuming, and this consuming drive survived the Soviet collapse. <em>Prevailing over others is the only foreign policy that Washington knows.</em></p>
<p>The mindset that America must prevail set the stage for the Neoconservatives and their 21st century wars, which, with Washington’s overthrow of the democratically elected government of Ukraine, has resulted in a crisis that has brought Washington into direct conflict with Russia.</p>
<p>I know the strategic institutes that serve Washington. I was the occupant of the William E.Simon Chair in Political Economy, Center for Strategic and International Studies, for a dozen years. The idea is prevalent that Washington must prevail over Russia in Ukraine or Washington will lose prestige and its superpower status.</p>
<p>The idea of prevailing always leads to war once one power thinks it has prevailed.</p>
<p>The path to war is reinforced by the Wolfowitz Doctrine. Paul Wolfowitz, the neoconservative intellectual who formulated US military and foreign policy doctrine, wrote among many similar passages:</p>
<p>“Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere [China], that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union. This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power.”</p>
<p>In the Wolfowitz Doctrine, any other strong country is defined as a <em>threat and a power hostile</em> to the US regardless of how willing that country is to get along with the US for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>The difference between Brzezinski and the Neoconservatives is that Brzezinski wants to suborn Russia and China by including them in the empire as important elements whose voices would be heard, If only for diplomatic reasons, whereas the Neoconservatives are prepared to rely on military force combined with internal subversion orchestrated with US financed NGOs and even terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>Neither the US nor Israel is embarrassed by their worldwide reputations as the two countries that pose the greatest threat. In fact, both countries are proud to be recognized as the greatest threats. The foreign policy of both countries is devoid of any diplomacy. US and Israeli foreign policy rests on violence alone. Washington tells countries to do as Washington says or be “bombed into the stone age.” Israel declares all Palestinians, even women and children, to be “terrorists,” and proceeds to shoot them down in the streets, claiming that Israel is merely protecting itself against terrorists. Israel, which does not recognize the existence of Palestine as a country, covers up its crimes with the claim that Palestinians do not accept the existence of Israel.</p>
<p>“We don’t need no stinking diplomacy. We got power.”</p>
<p>This is the attitude that guarantees war, and that is where the US is taking the world. The prime minister of Britain, the chancellor of Germany, and the president of France are Washington’s enablers. They provide the cover for Washington. Instead of war crimes, Washington has “coalitions of the willing” and military invasions that bring “democracy and women’s rights” to non-compliant countries.</p>
<p>China gets much the same treatment. A country with four times the US population but a smaller prison population, China is constantly criticized by Washington as an “authoritarian state.” China is accused of human rights abuses while US police brutalize the US population.</p>
<p>The problem for humanity is that Russia and China are not Libya and Iraq. These two countries possess strategic nuclear weapons. Their land mass greatly exceeds that of the US. The US, which was unable to successfully occupy Baghdad or Afghanistan, has no prospect of prevailing against Russia and China in conventional warfare. Washington will push the nuclear button. What else can we expect from a government devoid of morality?</p>
<p>The world has never experienced rogue states comparable to Washington and Israel. Both governments are prepared to murder anyone and everyone. Look at the crisis that Washington has created in Ukraine and the dangers thereof. On May 23, 2014, Russia’s President Putin spoke to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, a three-day gathering of delegations from 62 countries and CEOs from 146 of the largest Western corporations.</p>
<p>Putin did not speak of the billions of dollars in trade deals that were being formalized. Instead Putin spoke of the crisis that Washington had brought to Russia, and he criticized Europe for being Washington’s vassals for supporting Washington’s propaganda against Russia and Washington’s interference in vital Russian interests.</p>
<p>Putin was diplomatic in his language, but the message that powerful economic interests from the US and Europe received is that it will lead to trouble if Washington and European governments continue to ignore Russia’s concerns and continue to act as if they can interfere in Russia’s vital interests as if Russia did not exist.</p>
<p>The heads of these large corporations will carry this message back to Washington and European capitals. Putin made it clear that the lack of dialogue with Russia could lead to the West making the mistake of putting Ukraine in NATO and establishing missile bases on Russia’s border with Ukraine. Putin has learned that Russia cannot rely on good will from the West, and Putin made it clear, short of issuing a threat, that Western military bases in Ukraine are unacceptable.</p>
<p>Washington will continue to ignore Russia. However, European capitals will have to decide whether Washington is pushing them into conflict with Russia that is against European interests. Thus, Putin is testing European politicians to determine if there is sufficient intelligence and independence in Europe for a rapprochement.</p>
<p>If Washington in its overbearing arrogance and hubris forces Putin to write off the West, the Russian/Chinese strategic alliance, which is forming to counteract Washington’s hostile policy of surrounding both countries with military bases, will harden into preparation for the inevitable war.</p>
<p>The survivors, if any, can thank the Neoconservatives, the Wolfowitz doctrine, and the Brzezinski strategy for the destruction of life on earth.</p>
<p>The American public contains a large number of misinformed people who think they know everything. These people have been programmed by US and Israeli propaganda to equate Islam with political ideology. They believe that Islam, a religion, is instead a militarist doctrine that calls for the overthrow of Western civilization, as if anything remains of Western civilization.</p>
<p>Many believe this propaganda even in the face of complete proof that the Sunnis and Shi’ites hate one another far more than they hate their Western oppressors and occupiers. The US has departed Iraq, but the carnage today is as high or higher than during the US invasion and occupation. The daily death tolls from the Sunni/Shi’ite conflict are extraordinary. A religion this disunited poses no threat to anyone except Islamists themselves. Washington successfully used Islamist disunity to overthrow Gaddafi, and is currently using Islamist disunity in an effort to overthrow the government of Syria. Islamists cannot even unite to defend themselves against Western aggression. There is no prospect of Islamists uniting in order to overthrow the West.</p>
<p>Even if Islam could do so, it would be pointless for Islam to overthrow the West. The West has overthrown itself. In the US the Constitution has been murdered by the Bush and Obama regimes. Nothing remains. As the US <em>is</em> the Constitution, what was once the United States no longer exists. A different entity has taken its place.</p>
<p>Europe died with the European Union, which requires the termination of sovereignty of all member countries. A few unaccountable bureaucrats in Brussels have become superior to the wills of the French, German, British, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Greek, and Portuguese peoples.</p>
<p>Western civilization is a skeleton. It still stands, barely, but there is no life in it. The blood of liberty has departed. Western peoples look at their governments and see nothing but enemies. Why else has Washington militarized local police forces, equipping them as if they were occupying armies? Why else has Homeland Security, the Department of Agriculture, and even the Postal Service and Social Security Administration ordered billions of rounds of ammunition and even submachine guns? What is this taxpayer-paid-for arsenal for if not to suppress US citizens?</p>
<p>As the prominent trends forecaster Gerald Celente spells out in the current <em>Trends Journal</em>, “uprisings span four corners of the globe.” Throughout Europe angry, desperate and outraged peoples march against EU financial policies that are driving the peoples into the ground. Despite all of Washington’s efforts with its well funded fifth columns known as NGOs to destabilize Russia and China, both the Russian and Chinese governments have far more support from their people than do the US and Europe.</p>
<p>In the 20th century Russia and China learned what tyranny is, and they have rejected it.</p>
<p>In the US tyranny has entered under the guise of the “war on terror,” a hoax used to scare the sheeple into abandoning their civil liberties, thus freeing Washington from accountability to law and permitting Washington to erect a militarist police state. Ever since WWII Washington has used its financial hegemony and the “Soviet threat,” now converted into the “Russian threat,” to absorb Europe into Washington’s empire.</p>
<p>Putin is hoping that the interests of European countries will prevail over subservience to Washington. This is Putin’s current bet. This is the reason Putin remains unprovoked by Washington’s provocations in Ukraine.</p>
<p>If Europe fails Russia, Putin and China will prepare for the war that Washington’s drive for hegemony makes inevitable.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Prior to the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq, US and other western oil companies were all but completely shut out of Iraq’s oil market. But thanks to the invasion and occupation, the companies are now back inside Iraq and producing oil there for the first time since being forced out of the country in 1973.”</p>
<p>– Antonia Juhasz, oil industry analyst,  Al Jazeera.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are the ‘best of times’ for the oil giants in Iraq.  Production is up, profits are soaring, and big oil is rolling in dough.  Here’s the story from the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Iraq’s oil production surged to its highest level in over 30 years last month, surprising skeptics of the country’s efforts to restore its oil industry after decades of war and neglect.”  (Wall Street Journal)</p></blockquote>
<p>Mission accomplished?</p>
<p>You bet.  But for those who still cling to the idea that the US was serious about promoting democracy or removing a vicious dictator or  eliminating WMD or any of the other kooky excuses, consider what we’ve learned in the last couple weeks. Here’s the story from Aljazeera:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While the US military has formally ended its occupation of Iraq, some of the largest western oil companies, ExxonMobil, BP and Shell, remain.</p>
<p>On November 27, 38 months after Royal Dutch Shell announced its pursuit of a massive gas deal in southern Iraq, the oil giant had its contract signed for a $17bn flared gas deal. Three days later, the US-based energy firm Emerson submitted a bid for a contract to operate at Iraq’s giant Zubair oil field, which reportedly holds some eight million barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Emerson was awarded a contract to provide crude oil metering systems and other technology for a new oil terminal in Basra, currently under construction in the Persian Gulf, and the company is installing control systems in the power stations in Hilla and Kerbala. Iraq’s supergiant Rumaila oil field is already being developed by BP, and the other supergiant reserve, Majnoon oil field, is being developed by Royal Dutch Shell. Both fields are in southern Iraq.” (“Western oil firms remain as US exits Iraq”, Dahr Jamail, Aljazeera.)</p></blockquote>
<p>If it sounds like the big boys are dividing the spoils among themselves; it’s because they are. Exxon, BP, Shell; they’re all here. They all have their contracts in hand, and they’re all drilling their brains out thanks to the American servicemen and women who gave their lives for some trumped up baloney about WMD. Isn’t that what’s going on?</p>
<p>Sure it is. And even now–after all the reasons for going to war have been exposed as lies–the farce continues. Nothing has changed. Nothing. There’s still no talk of reparations, no official investigation, no indictments, no prosecutions, no trials, no penalties, no nothing. Not even a stinking apology. Just a big “up yours” Iraq. We’re way too important to apologize for killing a million of your people and reducing your five thousand year old civilization to a pile of rubble.  Instead, we’ll just screw you some more and paper it over with a little public relations, like Obama did a couple weeks ago when he promised to “leave behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people”.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. Obama’s all about sovereignty and stability, everyone knows that.  That’s why Baghdad is the terror capital of the world, because Obama’s so committed to security.</p>
<p>These PR blurbs are effective though, they provide the necessary cover for leaving enough troops behind to protect the oil installations and pipelines.  That’s the kind of security Obama cares about. Security for the oiligarchs and their stolen property.  Everyone else can fend for themselves, which is why Baghdad is such a bloody mess.  Here’s more from Aljazeera:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Prior to the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq, US and other western oil companies were all but completely shut out of Iraq’s oil market,” oil industry analyst Antonia Juhasz told Al Jazeera. “But thanks to the invasion and occupation, the companies are now back inside Iraq and producing oil there for the first time since being forced out of the country in 1973.” (Aljazeera)
</p></blockquote>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/iraqwarforoil3.jpg"  /></p>
</div>
<p>Yeah, thanks for that invasion, Mr. Bush. We couldn’t have done it without you, guy. Hope you have a great retirement painting pictures of poodles and stuff while people continue to get blown to pieces in the terrorist Hellhole you created. Here’s more Al Jazeera:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Juhasz, author of the books The Tyranny of Oil and The Bush Agenda, said that while US and other western oil companies have not yet received all they had hoped the US-led invasion of Iraq would bring them, “They’ve certainly done quite well for themselves, landing production contracts for some of the world’s largest remaining oil fields under some of the world’s most lucrative terms.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr Abdulhay Yahya Zalloum, an international oil consultant and economist …(said) he believes western oil companies have successfully acquired the lions’ share of Iraq’s oil, “but they gave a little piece of the cake for China and some of the other countries and companies to keep them silent”. (Aljazeera)</p>
<p>How do you like that? These guys operate just like the Mafia. The Bossman pays off China with a few million barrels, and China keeps its mouth shut. Nice. Everyone gets “their cut” so they don’t go blabbing to the media about the ripoff that’s taking place in broad daylight. The stench of corruption is overpowering.</p>
<p>And here’s something else you won’t see in the media. In a White House press release,  the Obama administration announced that they would continue to support Iraq’s “efforts to develop the energy sector” in order  to “help boost Iraq’s oil production.”….</p>
<p>According to Assim Jihad, spokesman for Iraq’s ministry of oil, “Iraq has a goal of raising its oil production capacity to 12m bpd by 2017, which would place it in the top echelon of global producers.” (Aljazeera)</p>
<p>“12 million barrels-per-day by 2017″?</p>
<p>That makes this the biggest petroleum heist in history. And we’re supposed to believe that the oil bigwigs didn’t know anything about this before the war? What a crock! I’ll bet you even money the CEOs and their lackeys figured out that Saudi Arabia was running out of gas, so they decided to pick up stakes and move their operations to good old Mesopotamia. That’s why they put their money on Bush and Cheney, because they knew that two former oil men would do the heavy lifting once they got shoehorned into the White House.  The whole thing was a set-up from the get-go, right down to the 5 shady Supremes who suspended the voting in Florida and crowned Bush emperor in 2000. The whole thing was probably mapped out years in advance.</p>
<p>Big oil runs everything in America. People talk about the power of Wall Street and Israel, but oil is still king. They run it all, and they own it all. And “what they say, goes.”  Here’s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Juhasz explained that ExxonMobil, BP and Shell were among the oil companies that “played the most aggressive roles in lobbying their governments to ensure that the invasion would result in an Iraq open to foreign oil companies”.</p>
<p>They succeeded,” she added. “They are all back in.” (Aljazeera)</p></blockquote>
<p>Hooray. Big oil wins again, and all it cost was a million or so Iraqis who got blown to bits air raids or shot up at checkpoints, or beaten to death with a rubber hose at Abu Ghraib or any of the other democracy reeducation centers that dot the countryside. But, hey, look at the bright side: At least production is up, right? Can you see how sick this is? Here’s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Under the current circumstances, the possibility of a withdrawal of western oil companies from Iraq appears remote, and the Obama administration continues to pressure Baghdad to pass the Iraq Oil Law.” (Aljazeera)</p></blockquote>
<p>And what is the “Iraq Oil Law”, you ask?</p>
<p>It’s a way to privatize the oil market using Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs) which disproportionately benefit the corporations.  Obama’s a big backer of the law since it means even heftier profits for his thieving  friends.  In other words, the humongous profits they’re already skimming off aren’t quite good enough. They want more. They want to own the whole shooting match lock, stock and barrel.</p>
<p>This is really an outrage. What other country behaves like this?</p>
<p>No one. No other country in the world goes out and kills a million people, destroys their country, and leaves them to scrape by on next to nothing just so they can pad the bank accounts of voracious plutocrats have more dough than they know what to do with. No one else would even dare to act like that for fear that they’d get bombed into annihilation by the world’s biggest bullyboy, the US of A.  Only the US can get away with this type of crap, because the US is a law unto itself.</p>
<p>Iraq was the Cradle of Civilization. Now it’s the cradle of shit. The US decimated Iraq; blew it to bits, bombed its industries, its bridges, its schools, its hospitals, leveled its cities, polluted its water, spread diseases everywhere, killed its kids,  pitted brother against brother,   and transformed a vibrant, unique country into a dysfunctional cesspit run by opportunists, gangsters, and fanatics.</p>
<p>And, here’s the corker:  No one gives a rip. Face it: No one gives a flying fu** about Iraq. The American people lost interest long ago, the politicians can’t be bothered, and the UN is too afraid of the US to lift a finger to help. They’d rather stamp their feet and scold Putin over Crimea than utter a peep about the genocide in Iraq.  That’s the state of things today, right?  No accountability for the men who started the war, and no justice for the victims. Just the infrequent (phony) pronouncement of support from the White House or the all-too-frequent sectarian bombing that leaves an untold number of civilians dead or wounded. This is all the US leaves behind; hatred, death and destruction.</p>
<p>Here’s a clip from a poem by Iraqi writer who wants readers to take a minute and think about all the suffering the United States has created. The poem is titled “Flying Kites”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Come and see our overflowing morgues and find our little ones for us…</p>
<p>You may find them in this corner or the other, a little hand poking out, pointing out at you…</p>
<p>Come and search for them in the rubble of your “surgical” air raids, you may find a little leg or a little head…pleading for your attention.</p>
<p>Come and see them amassed in the garbage dumps, scavenging morsels of food…</p>
<p>Come and see  our little ones, under-nourished or dying from disease. Cholera, dysentery, infections…</p>
<p>Come and see, come….”  (“Flying Kites” Layla Anwar)</p></blockquote>
<p>A million people were killed so a few rich fu**ers could get even richer. That’s a hell of a legacy.</p>

			<p>It is easy to stand up and cheer for your favorite government activity. It is quite another to acknowledge what it means in the real world.</p>
<p>I almost never try to speak for other people. However, I think it is fairly safe to say that the average military recruit firmly believes that he joins the military so that you and I can live and breathe in freedom. To be sure, he had other reasons for joining, but I think the defense of liberty is a fairly common characteristic.</p>
<p>That is certainly what I thought when I was in Navy boot camp in Orlando, Florida, in 1983. After all, this is what I had been told all my life: sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines defend freedom.</p>
<p>But is this actually what they do?</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Marine lost both legs in an IED blast in Iraq. He claims he was forced by TSA to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/mar/19/tsa-agents-humiliated-wounded-marine-aggressive-in/" target="_blank">remove both prosthetic legs</a> before he could board an airplane in Phoenix.</li>
<li>This Vietnam veteran in Spicewood, Texas, had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/08/raids-of-the-day-the-capi_n_2644894.html" target="_blank">flashbacks to his combat experience during a marijuana raid</a> at a friend’s house. What police claimed was marijuana turned out to be ragweed.<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg?w=300&amp;h=152" alt="jared goering" width="300" height="152" /></a></li>
<li>Jared Goering, who served 19 years in the Army, including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was <a href="http://www.lifewithdogs.tv/2013/08/veteran-kicked-off-boardwalk-for-having-a-service-dog/" target="_blank">kicked off the boardwalk in Wildwood, N.J.</a> for walking with his service dog, Gator.</li>
<li>Emily Yates, who served two tours with the Army in Iraq, was <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=3bf_1378009165" target="_blank">violently arrested by park police in Philadelphia</a> for asking why she couldn’t play her banjo under some shade trees.</li>
<li>Dimitrios Karras is a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan. Read about the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/ares-armor-operating-store-camera-caught-first-moments-of-saturday-raid" target="_blank">ATF raid on his business</a> in National City, California.</li>
<li>Martin Goldberg of Brooklyn is a World War II veteran <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/raid-of-t_n_3102929.html" target="_blank">whose apartment was subject to a drug raid</a>. Later, the cops realized they had raided the wrong apartment. His 83-year-old wife was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat as a result of the raid.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/norfolk-41.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/norfolk-41.jpg?w=640" alt="norfolk 4" /></a></li>
<li>In 1997, four sailors from the USS Saipan (LHA-2) were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19Norfolk-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">falsely accused</a> of the rape and murder of a Norfolk, Virginia, woman. One spent eight-and-one-half years in prison while the other three were sentenced to life in prison. These three were pardoned in 2009. Even though the actual killer is serving a life sentence, four innocent men are still required to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Four" target="_blank">register as sex offenders</a> and are still <a href="http://www.norfolkfour.com/" target="_blank">fighting to clear their names</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/charles.loeks/posts/584864751544987?comment_id=6139516&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=4&amp;notif_t=feed_comment_reply" target="_blank">Charles Loeks</a> was 18 and fresh out of Marine boot camp. On a trip home to Covina, California, he was hanging out with a few friends when he was arrested for resisting arrest and nothing else. He spent 21 days in Los Angeles County jail, even though he had harmed no one.</li>
<li><a href="http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2014/04/22/north-carolina-deputy-snatches-two-phones-fails-snatch-third-handcuffs-man-reason/" target="_blank">Carlos Jaramillo</a> is a former Marine combat instructor who lives in Onslow County, North Carolina. Watch what happened when he recorded a sheriff’s deputy who arrested him for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>Noel Polanco was an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/nyregion/funeral-for-noel-polanco-unarmed-man-killed-by-police.html" target="_blank">unarmed 22-year-old National Guardsman</a> who was shot and killed by New York City police at a traffic stop near LaGuardia Airport.</li>
<li>John Laigaie, a retired Army master sergeant, was <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/bellingham-man-wins-15000-settlement-after-city-co/nZPdj/" target="_blank">threatened at gunpoint</a> by police while legally carrying a gun in a park in Bellingham, Washington.</li>
<li>Homer Wright is an 80-year-old Army veteran who was <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/80-year-old-homeowner-arrested-for-shooting-burglar.html" target="_blank">charged with felony gun use</a> after he shot a burglar who entered his home in Englewood, Illinois.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/schmidter.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/schmidter.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" alt="schmidter" width="300" height="225" /></a></li>
<li>Mark Schmidter, a Vietnam veteran who lives in Orlando, is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeAreMarkSchmidter/info" target="_blank">currently serving 145 days in a cage</a> for passing out <a href="http://fija.org/" target="_blank">jurors’ rights</a> information on the steps of a local courthouse.</li>
<li>Justin Ross of Ankeny, Iowa, was recently discharged from the Army. <a href="http://whotv.com/2014/02/03/raid-filmed-ankeny-police-traumatize-family/" target="_blank">Police used a battering ram</a> to enter his home executing a warrant for some items purchased with stolen credit cards. They did not find any of these items.</li>
<li>Saadiq Long is an Air Force veteran who was placed on a TSA no-fly list. He had to <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/US-Air-Force-Veteran-Fina-by-Glenn-Greenwald-130210-789.html" target="_blank">battle for months</a> to be removed from this list just so he could fly home from Qatar to visit his ailing mother.</li>
<li>Chuck Benton of Long Grove, Iowa, served 22 years in the Army. He was <a href="http://rare.us/story/im-a-christian-and-i-want-to-end-the-drug-war/" target="_blank">arrested and charged</a> simply for living in the same house with his son who was <a href="http://qctimes.com/news/local/medical-marijuana-heads-for-trial-in-iowa/article_3f94aa61-1fe8-5462-b2bf-4d5b598824e4.html" target="_blank">growing medical marijuana</a>.</li>
<li>Cody Donovan is a former Marine MP who lives in New Milford, N.J. He was <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/newmilford/New_Milford_man_allegedly_carried_loaded_gun_to_Garden_State_Plaza_during_shooting.html?mobile=1&amp;ic=1&amp;iphone=1" target="_blank">charged with unlawful possession of a weapon</a> after carrying a loaded gun into the Garden State Plaza mall when he attempted to help police apprehend the shooter.<br />

<li>In 1932, 17,000 veterans marched on Washington to demand payment of bonuses they had been promised as a result of their service in World War I. Two were shot and killed by police. 55 were arrested and 135 were injured when the United States Army became an instrument of domestic law enforcement. Two of the chief enforcers were named MacArthur and Patton. Yes, those two.</li>
<li>Mark England, an Army combat medic who saw action in Iraq and Kosovo was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48iLJ8NCEF8">beaten and tasered by police</a> at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas.</li>
<li>Air Force Staff Sergeant Matt Pinkerton of Glen Burnie, Maryland, faces <a href="http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/for_the_record/attorney-glen-burnie-shooting-was-self-defense/article_36bb4d67-b713-5b22-b6c5-d9e2b1d1016d.html" target="_blank">second degree murder charges</a> after fatally shooting a home intruder in September.</li>
<li>Leo Hendrick, an army veteran who lives in Northwood, Iowa, faces up to <a href="http://globegazette.com/news/local/northwood-chicken-trial-begins-tuesday/article_7ce23d57-2911-5b65-9ade-89a857e9b7c2.html" target="_blank">30 days in jail and a $600 fine</a> for raising chickens in his yard.</li>
<li>Yes, the cops had a search warrant. However that in no way excuses their <a href="http://www.king5.com/news/get-jesse/Lakewood-landlord-left-with-repair-bill-after-search-warrant-by-police-246460031.html" target="_blank">vandalizing the home</a> of Army veteran Dan Neary of Lakewood, Washington.</li>
<li>These World War II veterans were <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/10/vets-knock-down-barrier-to-visit-wwii-memorial/" target="_blank">threatened with arrest</a> for visiting a closed war memorial in Washington, D.C. during the October “shutdown.”<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vets-arrested-nyc1.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vets-arrested-nyc1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=260" alt="vets arrested nyc" width="300" height="260" /></a></li>
<li>These Vietnam <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/10/police-arrest-vietnam-veterans-nyc-memorial/70276/" target="_blank">veterans actually were arrested</a> for visiting a New York City war memorial after curfew.</li>
<li>Denis Reynoso was a disabled veteran who saw action with the Marines in Iraq. He <a href="http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/23350877/2013/09/05/one-person-transported-to-hospital-after-lynn-shooting" target="_blank">was shot dead by police</a> in his Lynn, Massachusetts, apartment.</li>
<li>Nick Morgan, an Iraq veteran, was pulled out of a crowd by police in Hempstead, New York, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZaJQUhVFH0" target="_blank">trampled by their horses</a>.</li>
<li>Gary Shepherd of Broadhead, Kentucky was a Vietnam veteran. He used medical cannabis to relieve the pain in his left arm, which was crippled during the war. Shepherd was <a href="http://www.hr95.org/Memorial.html" target="_blank">shot dead by a SWAT team</a>, after they had threatened to cut down his cannabis plants.</li>
<li>Valente and Manuel Valenzuela of San Antonio produced sufficient documentation to enlist, respectively, in the Army and Marine Corps. Both fought in Vietnam, where Valente won a Bronze Star. Now they are <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Vietnam-veterans-at-risk-of-being-deported-4855055.php" target="_blank">facing deportation to Mexico</a> because of erroneous entries on their birth certificates.</li>
<li>Jerome Murdough, a homeless Marine Corps veteran, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/20/homeless-veteran-dies-in-overheated-rikers-island-cell/" target="_blank">died in a jail cell on New York’s Rikers Island</a> after being arrested for trespassing. A heating malfunction caused the temperature in the cell to soar to 100 degrees.</li>
<li>Kenneth Chamberlain was a retired Marine and Vietnam veteran living in White Plains, New York. Early one morning he set off his medical alert device. The first responders in this case were not medics, but rather <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yu6yIeL6Ts" target="_blank">police, who proceeded to kill Mr. Chamberlain</a>.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vets-for-64-colorado.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vets-for-64-colorado.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169" alt="Colorado veterans say LEGALIZE!" width="300" height="169" /></a></li>
<li>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEnjYprPqmk" target="_blank">group of combat veterans in Colorado</a> organized to help <a href="http://regulatemarijuana.org/" target="_blank">legalize marijuana</a> during the 2012 elections. They claim – and I believe them – that marijuana helps mitigate PTSD. If you support any punishment whatsoever for a <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2013/03/22/treating-ptsd-with-medical-marijuana" target="_blank">combat veteran who heals himself</a> with a plant that grows wild in some form within a few miles of you, I don’t care what you tell me. YOU DON’T BELIEVE IN FREEDOM!</li>
<li>Stanley Gibson, a <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/disabled-veteran-killed-police-shooting" target="_blank">43-year-old Gulf War veteran</a> was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVpT3d6ik-8" target="_blank">shot dead over a total non-crime</a> by Las Vegas police in December, 2011.</li>
<li>Army Specialist Michael Sharkey returned home from deployment in Afghanistan to find his home in New Port Richey, Florida, unlawfully occupied by two squatters. The local sheriff says that Sharkey has <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2610917/Outrage-pair-ex-convict-squatters-Florida-home-Afghan-war-veteran-refuse-leave.html" target="_blank">no grounds upon which to evict them</a>.</li>
<li>These veterans say they are being required to <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/03/va-says-routine-is-to-threaten-vets-gun-rights/" target="_blank">prove they are worthy of gun rights</a>. Our rights are <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2012/07/01/life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-godliness-a-sermon-i-would-like-to-preach/" target="_blank">gifts from God</a> that are inherent in our very humanity. We never have to prove to anybody that we have them.</li>
<li>Dwight Edwards, a disabled Marine veteran of Afghanistan, says that cops in Queens <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/ex-marine-claims-cops-beat-103rd-precinct-article-1.1327916" target="_blank">brutally beat him for no reason</a>.</li>
<li>Army Staff Sgt. C.J. Grisham, who won the Bronze Star with Valor, was <a href="http://www.kcentv.com/story/21860185/local-soldier-says-police-violated-his-guns-rights" target="_blank">forcibly disarmed for no good reason by a policeman</a> while on a hike with his son not far from Fort Hood, Texas.<br />

<li>Brandon Raub, a Marine who was decorated for bravery in Iraq and Afghanistan, was forced to spend a week in a Virginia mental hospital over <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=N5dA1N3S9Es" target="_blank">some “anti-government” Facebook posts</a>. (His interviewer here, <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/about/john_whitehead_extended_bio/" target="_blank">John Whitehead</a>, is a constitutional attorney, Vietnam infantry veteran and superlative <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/" target="_blank">anti-police state blogger</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/operation_vigilant_eagle_is_this_really_how_we_honor_our_nations_veterans" target="_blank">Operation Vigilant Eagle</a> is a project of the Department of Homeland Security that has led to numerous Iraq and Afghanistan veterans “finding themselves under surveillance, threatened with incarceration or involuntary commitment, or arrested, all for daring to voice their concerns about the alarming state of our union and the erosion of our freedoms.” Indeed, merely being a <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf" target="_blank">“returning veteran”</a> can have you designated as a potential terrorist.<br />

<li>We will never know the whole truth about Navy veteran and former Los Angeles cop <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/02/17/there-is-no-truth-only-news/" target="_blank">Christopher Dorner</a>, who was the subject of a police manhunt and media witch hunt in 2013. He never got the chance to tell his story in court.</li>
<li>Hector Barrios came to America in 1961. He was drafted and served as an infantry soldier in Vietnam. In 1996, he was busted for possessing marijuana, which he used to treat his PTSD. As a result, he was <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/04/25/Vietnam-vet-dies-abroad-deported-from-the-country-he-served/5401398450290/" target="_blank">deported to his native Mexico</a> where he died.</li>
<li>Matthew Corrigan of Washington, D.C. was a first sergeant in the Army Reserve and a veteran of Iraq. <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/guns/2012/may/28/miller-swat-rampage-destroys-iraq-vets-home-over-g/" target="_blank">His home was destroyed in a SWAT rampage</a> because it was reported to the police that Corrigan had a gun.</li>
<li>Jamie Dean was an Army veteran of Afghanistan was diagnosed with PTSD. Upset about his impending deployment to Iraq, Dean had an intense emotional outburst at his Maryland home in December 2006. Even though he neither harmed nor threatened anyone, he was <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig7/bothwell2.html" target="_blank">shot and killed by a local SWAT team</a>.<br />

<li>Bennie Coleman, 76, is a retired Marine who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2013/09/08/left-with-nothing/" target="_blank">lost his Washington, D.C., home because of a $134 tax lien</a> that District authorities had sold to an investor.</li>
<li>Jeremy Usher is a former Navy hospital corpsman who lives in Greeley, Colorado. He faces jail time for using <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22708848/greeley-veteran-faces-jail-time-using-marijuana-treatment" target="_blank">medical marijuana</a> to treat his PTSD.</li>
<li>Brittany Ball, a 23-year-old soldier at Fort Jackson, S.C., was <a href="http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/23686918/cell-phone-video-shows-off-duty-deputy-attempt-to-arrest-soldier-at-bar" target="_blank">manhandled by a cop</a> at a local bar, even though she had done nothing wrong.</li>

In 2010, he was <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/jun/08/erik-scotts-family-files-lawsuit-against-costco-sh/" target="_blank">gunned down and killed by police</a> as he peacefully walked out of a Las Vegas Costco.</li>
<li>Scott Olsen saw action with the Marines in Iraq. Later, he would join the Occupy Oakland movement. In October, 2011, <a href="http://rt.com/usa/police-occupy-oakland-olsen-831/" target="_blank">suffered a fractured skull</a> after being hit in the head with a projectile fired by police.</li>
<li>Derek Hale served honorably with the Marines in Iraq. Although, he had committed no crime, he died after being <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032702486.html" target="_blank">tasered three times and then shot three times</a> by police in Wilmington, Delaware.</li>
<li>Roderick King, an Iraq war veteran, <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/dncrime/Philly-cop-arrested-suspended-for-false-imprisonment.html" target="_blank">was arrested in Philadelphia</a> after he and his friends had criticized a cop’s driving.</li>
<li>Howard Dean Bailey, a Navy veteran, was <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/04/howard-dean-bailey-deported-i-served-my-country-and-then-it-kicked-me-out-105606.html#.U0mHYfldWSp" target="_blank">deported to his native Jamaica</a> when immigration authorities discovered he had taken a plea bargain in a marijuana case in Norfolk, Virginia.<br />

<li>To be sure, the recently deceased folk singer Pete Seeger could not have been more of a leftist. However, he did serve three years in the Army after being drafted during World War II. He was <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/pete_seeger_1919_2014_he_changed_the_world_one_song_at_a_time" target="_blank">sentenced to one year in jail</a> after refusing to reveal his political connections to the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956. He appealed this sentence, citing the First Amendment, and ultimately spent only four hours behind bars.</li>
<li>Larry Kirschenman of Nogales, Arizona, served 22 years in the Army and was decorated for bravery in Vietnam. Learn how he was brutalized by Border Patrol agents when asking why he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1-U7beD4I4" target="_blank">subjected to a warrantless search</a>.</li>
<li>We will never know for sure what happened in Army veteran Matthew Stewart’s Ogden, Utah, apartment one night in January 2012, as he will never have his day in court. He was in prison awaiting trial on charges of shooting and killing one of the police officers who raided his apartment searching for marijuana. Stewart, whose guilt was never proven, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/24/matthew-david-stewart_n_3332915.html" target="_blank">committed suicide in his cell. </a></li>
<li>Sergio Arreola is a cop in Los Angeles who served with the Marines in Iraq. He was beaten by the police in suburban Pomona for <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2014/01/no-honor-among-thugs.html" target="_blank">no good reason whatsoever</a>.</li>
<li>This former Army paratrooper is appealing to the New York state legislature to legalize medical marijuana. He has severe multiple sclerosis and is <a href="http://www.mpp.org/media/op-eds/let-this-be-the-year-for.html" target="_blank">“forced to break the law to have some semblance of a bearable existence.”</a><br />

<li>On May 5, 2011, a Tucson SWAT team approached the home of Jose Guerena, who had served two tours with the Marines in Iraq. Guerena grabbed his AR-15 as is his right, but did not fire. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/tucson-swat-team-defends-shooting-iraq-marine-veteran/story?id=13640112#.UZYlqEqS2MI" target="_blank">The SWAT team let loose with 71 rounds, 60 of which perforated Guerena’s body.</a></li>
<li>Marty Maiden lived a few blocks from Guerena in Tucson. and saw action with the Army in Afghanistan. He posted a suicidal note on Facebook which prompted a call to the police, <a href="http://www.jrn.com/kgun9/news/A-man-is-dead-after-officer-involved-shooting-232690341.html" target="_blank">who shot him dead</a>.</li>
<li>Steve Lefemine is a <a href="http://lefemineforlife.net/?p=82" target="_blank">West Point graduate</a> who was arrested for protesting against abortion in a “no-demonstration zone” outside the Republican National Convention in New York in 2004. The 2nd Circuit U.S. Circuit Court justified the arrest based on a <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/08_-_August/2nd_Circuit_upholds_RNC_arrests_of_two_anti-abortion_protesters/" target="_blank">“compelling state interest in security”</a>.<br />

<li>Eileen Erickson’s husband Sid served in Vietnam and died of Agent Orange exposure. Erickson is now in the crosshairs of authorities in Venice, California, who want to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-lopez-treehouse-20130911,0,6227023.column" target="_blank">tear down the tree house</a> Sid built before he died.</li>
<li>Listen to this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C430EHLtAZs" target="_blank">disabled Navy veteran plead</a> with then-Senate candidate Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) about the benefits of medical marijuana. Listen to the totalitarian response.</li>
<li>John Wrana, a 95-year-old Army Air Corps veteran of World War II, was <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-03/news/ct-met-kass-0802-20130803_1_butcher-type-kitchen-knife-park-forest-police-taser" target="_blank">tasered and then shot to death</a> by police in Forest Park, Illinois. His “crime”? Refusing medical attention.</li>
<li>John Colaprete saw action in Vietnam as a Marine Corps officer. In 1994, his Virginia Beach home and restaurants were the object of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/us/3-businessmen-testify-of-armed-raids-by-irs.html" target="_blank">paramilitary-style raids by the IRS</a>. The raid was prompted by a false accusation by a former employee. While you need to watch this documentary in its entirety some time, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">for now just pick it up for a few minutes starting at the 55:40 mark</a>.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/joe-louis.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/joe-louis.jpg?w=640" alt="joe louis" /></a></li>
<li>Boxing legend Joe Louis was also tyrannized by the IRS. The Brown Bomber enlisted in the Army in 1942 saying “Let us at them Japs.” Louis never saw combat, as he was assigned to the Special Services Division. While still a civilian, Louis fought some charity bouts and donated the proceeds to the Navy Relief Society. The IRS, however, viewed these proceeds as taxable income. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Louis#World_War_II" target="_blank">IRS problems would plague him</a> all his life. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">Please watch this video starting at the 53:17 mark.</a></li>
<li>Adam Arroyo is a Hispanic veteran of the Iraq war who lives in Buffalo. <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130604/CITYANDREGION/130609629/1002" target="_blank">Police shot and killed his dog</a> while executing a drug warrant for a black man.</li>
<li>Henry Taylor was a retired Air Force veteran in Louisville, Tennessee, who was <a href="http://www.thedailytimes.com/Local_News/story/Blount-County-Sheriffs-deputy-shoots-kills-property-owner-during-security-check-id-039818" target="_blank">shot dead by a local sheriff’s deputy</a> while investigating a burglary at a rental property he owned.</li>
<li>This is a fascinating article: <a href="https://greendragontavern.com/CMS/GDT/articles/when-johnny-comes-marching-home...he-goes-to-jail" target="_blank">When Johnny Comes Marching Home … He Goes to Jail</a>. It is absolutely tragic how we chew up and spit out so many of those we send to “fight for our freedom.”<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/kokesh1.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/kokesh1.jpg?w=640" alt="kokesh" /></a></li>
<li>Radio talk host Adam Kokesh won the Navy Commendation Medal as a Marine in Iraq. In recent years, he has been <a href="http://libertycrier.com/avtm-4-0-crowdfunder-campaign/?utm_source=The+Liberty+Crier&amp;utm_campaign=00062d8203-The_Liberty_Crier_Daily_News_2_5_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_600843dec4-00062d8203-284780633" target="_blank">arrested several times for various non-violent protests</a>. His most recent arrest happened after he loaded a shotgun in public in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 2013. On July 10, police <a href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/2013/07/12/thoughts-on-the-police-raid-on-adam-kokesh-and-on-his-canceled-march/" target="_blank">violently raided his home and arrested him</a>. He was incarcerated for four months <a href="http://benswann.com/adam-kokesh-a-modern-day-political-prisoner/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=nl" target="_blank">without bond, bail or trial</a>. He is currently on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh" target="_blank">probation for two years</a>. You may not like Kokesh’s demeanor or approve of all of his antics, but he has been very courageous when so many of his critics can’t be bothered to put down the remote.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg?w=640" alt="james moore" /></a></li>
<li>James Moore, my brothah from anothah mothah, walked away from a very lucrative engineering position in San Jose to re-enlist in the Army following 9/11. He sustained significant physical injuries as well as PTSD while serving in the Special Forces in Afghanistan. On the afternoon of March 25, 2008, Moore, who had done absolutely nothing wrong, was <a href="http://www.freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/necessary-force.html">beaten to the point of flat lining by Denver police.</a></li>
<li>One of the coolest people I have never met is Antonio Buehler. Buehler graduated from West Point in 1999, earned his Ranger tab, and saw action in Kosovo and Iraq. (He also sports a Stanford MBA.) Early in the morning on January 1, 2012, Buehler <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVZDpGCKks" target="_blank">was arrested</a> for taking a few pictures of Austin police manhandling a young woman outside a 7-11. Buehler has been arrested four times since. He heads the <a href="http://peacefulstreets.com/" target="_blank">Peaceful Streets Project</a>, whose members work to expose abuse, brutality and overreach both in Austin and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FreeAntonioBuehler/" target="_blank">across the nation</a>.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/antonio-buehler.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/antonio-buehler.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168" alt="antonio buehler" width="300" height="168" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are no doubt numerous other injustices against veterans that I do not know about. Enough to fill a book. None of these things would have happened if America were a free society. As Kokesh puts it, “The greatest enemies to the Constitution are not to be found in the sands of some far off land but rather right here at home.”</p>
<p>I cannot speak to the specific political beliefs of most of the veterans I have mentioned here. Some may be pacifists, while others may make John McCain look like a hippie in Haight-Ashbury. No matter what their individual views may be, the freedom they risked their lives for was flagrantly violated on the streets of the land they fought to protect.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg?w=586" alt="With the ability to carry 192 nuclear warheads, just one Ohio-class submarine is the world's sixth largest nuclear power." /></a></p>
<p>Society endlessly applauds sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines for “fighting for our freedom”. It is in no way disrespectful to say that this is not what they do. No foreign government or terrorist group poses any threat to our liberty. America accounts for about half of the world’s military spending. We have 300 ships in our Navy, plus thousands of planes, tanks and nuclear warheads as well as 300 million firearms in private hands. Nobody is going to invade us.</p>
<p>In a constitutional country, which America ceased to be 100 years ago, the job of the military – a vital and most noble one – is to defend the borders, shores and airspace. It cannot protect you from being tyrannized domestically. Indeed, throughout history, armies have been instruments of domestic tyranny. Our Constitution forbids a standing army for just this reason.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tienanmen.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tienanmen.jpg?w=586" alt="Keeping'em free." /></a></p>
<p>Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia had enormous military establishments. How did things work out in these countries?</p>
<p>I am a Christian who believes liberty is a gift from God – Leviticus 25:10; II Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:1. To quote Jefferson, liberty is preserved not by military might, but by “eternal vigilance” against one’s own government at all levels. It is the grossest form of disrespect to send young men around the world to “fight for freedom” while relinquishing that freedom on the home front.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif?w=586" alt="soldier letter cartoon" /></a>For several years, America has had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate" target="_blank">world’s highest incarceration rate</a>. Since 2001, Americans have gladly accepted previously unthinkable intrusions on their freedom in the name of “safety” and “security”. These include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig6/napolitano2.html" target="_blank">warrantless searches and spying</a>, the <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hornberger/hornberger130.html" target="_blank">suspension of habeas corpus</a>, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2011/07/14/tsa-does-not-protect-you-period/" target="_blank">sexual assault as a condition of travel</a>, rampant <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/350955711587953/" target="_blank">police brutality</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/" target="_blank">indefinite detention</a> without any semblance of due process, severe <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2012/05/02/were-almost-there-now/" target="_blank">restrictions on peaceful protest</a>, massive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/03/11/1-6-billion-rounds-of-ammo-for-homeland-security-its-time-for-a-national-conversation/" target="_blank">ammunition purchases by DHS</a> and <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/the_empire_strikes_back_attack_of_the_drones" target="_blank">surveillance drones in our skies</a> watching our every move. Can <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2011/07/imperial-priorities-obedience-first.html" target="_blank">predator drones</a> be far behind?</p>
<p>And in every election 98 percent of voters put their stamp of approval on perpetuating this monstrosity.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/boston-martial-law-3-e1368935624546.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/boston-martial-law-3-e1368935624546.jpg?w=586&amp;h=528" alt="boston martial law 3" width="586" height="528" /></a></p>
<p>On April 20, 2013, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/20/but-they-got-the-suspect-thats-not-the-point/" target="_blank">Boston and several surrounding towns</a> got a <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/25/lockdowns-do-not-keep-you-safe-letter-to-the-denver-post/" target="_blank">serious taste</a> of <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/23/sometimes-martial-law-is-necessary/" target="_blank">martial law</a>. How many military veterans were on the receiving end of this? Is this what they signed up to fight for?</p>
<p>Stop thinking in clichés. Have a good hard look at everything your media and government tell you. This includes media outlets and parts of the government that you like. Study. Read. Ask questions. And learn that the defense of liberty is not the duty of the military. Rather, it is your duty and mine.</p>

<p>China is an economic powerhouse. It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s second largest economy. It&#8217;s heading for number one status.</p>
<p>Perhaps sooner than most expect. It&#8217;s growth way outdistances America. It&#8217;s multiples greater.</p>
<p>Russia matches Washington&#8217;s military might. It does so in nuclear weapons strength. With sophisticated delivery systems.</p>
<p>Able to strike global targets accurately. With hugely destructive force. Enough to decimate potential adversaries. Perhaps to discourage potential aggression.</p>
<p>Russia is rich in what China needs most. Oil and gas mainly. Technological expertise. Industrial equipment. Sophisticated weapons.</p>
<p>Each nation is significant separately. They&#8217;re able to challenge America responsibly.</p>
<p>Together they&#8217;re a powerful combination. A force for world peace. For multi-polarity. For humanity. For weakening Washington&#8217;s imperium.</p>
<p>Sino-Russian ties stress unity. They&#8217;re strategically important. They&#8217;re stronger than ever in modern times.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re deepening. They expanding. Washington is increasingly concerned. It&#8217;s going all-out to subvert what weakens its strength.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s waging political, economic and cyberwar. It&#8217;s fighting a losing battle. Sino/Russian unity is odds on to prevail.</p>
<p>Especially with committed ties. With deepening ones. With stronger than ever ones.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Putin arrived in Shanghai. It&#8217;s China&#8217;s financial capital. He came to finalize a &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; trade deal. It&#8217;s enormously important.</p>
<p>It bonds both countries more closely together. It does so politically economically, commercially and militarily.</p>
<p>Both countries will trade increasingly in their own currencies. They&#8217;ll strengthen them. They&#8217;ll bypass dollar transactions. They&#8217;ll weaken it.</p>
<p>Russia will supply China with around 38 billion cubic million meters of natural gas annually. For the next 30 years.</p>
<p>It may double in size ahead. Depending on China&#8217;s internal needs.</p>
<p>Other increased trade was agreed on. In technological, industrial, and commercial sectors. In military hardware.</p>
<p>Growing Sino-Russian trade lessens reliance on increasingly undependable Western sources. It gives them less access to their markets.</p>
<p>Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping reject irresponsible US-led Western bashing. They called sanctions political tools.</p>
<p>They condemned &#8220;encouraging and financing&#8221; Washington&#8217;s regime change agenda.</p>
<p>The President of Russia&#8217;s web site <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/news/7199">headlined</a> &#8220;Russian-Chinese talks.&#8221; Both leaders met in Shanghai.</p>
<p>They &#8220;signed a <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/transcripts/7200">Joint Declaration</a> of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the new stage of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between the two countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>They &#8220;witnessed the signing of a package of intergovernmental, interdepartmental and commercial documents on cooperation in the economy, trade, energy and the humanitarian areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>They issued a joint statement. &#8220;(A)mbitious goals&#8221; were agreed on, it said. &#8220;(L)ong-term milestones&#8221; were established.</p>
<p>&#8220;(I)mportant bilateral documents&#8221; were signed. &#8220;Relations between Russia and the People’s Republic of China are developing successfully and have reached a new level of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation,&#8221; it stressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;(S)pecial attention (was on) economic issues. China is Russia&#8217;s leading foreign trade partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Sino/Russian Investment Committee was established. Its mandate is expanding economic and financial ties.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;diversifying trade.&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;reducing…dependence on global economic&#8221; conditions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s promoting cooperation in &#8220;technology-intensive areas.&#8221; They include industrial, commercial, banking and military areas.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re increasing bilateral ruble/renminbi trade. It bears repeating. Doing so bypasses dollar transactions. It weakens dollar strength.</p>
<p>Putin said &#8220;the historical memory of the great heroism of our peoples in World War II brings Russia and China even closer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both leaders agreed to hold joint celebrations. They&#8217;ll commemorate &#8220;the 70th anniversary of Victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other international issues were discussed. They include common geopolitical ones. Similar priorities are shared. Closer coordination is planned.</p>
<p>Sino/Russian unity, partnership and friendship were strengthened. It&#8217;s a &#8220;new stage&#8221; in &#8220;strategic relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strong bilateral relations are a force to be reckoned with. It promises to be more so ahead.</p>
<p>Moscow remains justifiably angry. It&#8217;s enraged about Washington elevating Kiev putschists to power. Rogue EU partners share blame.</p>
<p>Putin and Xi said crisis conditions can only be resolved diplomatically. They demand dialogue. They reject confrontation.</p>
<p>They &#8220;urged all Ukrainian regions and public and political groups to enter in broad nationwide talks…&#8221;</p>
<p>They want responsible governance. They want legitimate constitutional development.</p>
<p>They want &#8220;universally recognized rights and freedoms of people&#8221; observed.</p>
<p>Sergey Lavrov said Russian/EU/US-led NATO relations need fundamental reconsideration.</p>
<p>They require &#8220;essential rethinking,&#8221; he said. Disagreements must be resolved diplomatically, he stressed.</p>
<p>US-led NATO created Ukrainian crisis conditions. Russia targeting followed.</p>
<p>Western forces irresponsibly expand eastward. Encroaching on Russia&#8217;s borders threatens its heartland.</p>
<p>Bilateral relations are jeopardized. East/West confrontation is risked. So is world peace.</p>
<p>The road to Moscow runs through Kiev. Junta power has no legitimacy. Fundamental freedoms are targeted.</p>
<p>Eliminating them altogether is planned. Hardline rules runs things. Opposition isn&#8217;t tolerated.</p>
<p>Free expression is verboten. Putschists want their message alone getting out. They want vital truths suppressed.</p>
<p>Independent journalists aren&#8217;t safe. Russian LifeNews ones were targeted.</p>
<p>Oleg Sidyankin and Marat Saichenk were harassed. They were arrested. They&#8217;re detained. They&#8217;re held incommunicado.</p>
<p>Their lives potentially are endangered. They&#8217;re charged with &#8220;aiding terrorist groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>They released damning video images. They showed Kiev military forces using UN-marked attack helicopters against their own people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Air and ground assaults murder them in cold blood. Kiev wants this type information buried.</p>
<p>It wants reliable news sources eliminated. RT International&#8217;s stringer journalist Graham Phillips was arrested.</p>
<p>He explained by phone before silenced incommunicado, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m sitting at a blockade post in a portacabin. The dialogue is quite interrogation oriented.&#8221;</p>
<p>His car was searched. His laptop, equipment and personal belongings were confiscated.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment I’m with the Ukrainian forces…near Mariupol,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here for over two hours and I&#8217;ve been described, my status, as being detained in terms of I can&#8217;t leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would also say I&#8217;m being treated OK…I believe that someone is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve done checks on my documentation. They found my reports and clips I&#8217;ve done and they&#8217;re now looking through them asking me my position on things, asking if I&#8217;m a spy, and asking me quite thorough questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve checked all my documentation and photos, my laptop and the car. So that&#8217;s who I&#8217;m with at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was asked about separatism. About working with RT. He &#8220;describ(ed) (his) position on Crimea.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called its referendum legitimate. He stands by his position, he said.</p>
<p>He called Kiev&#8217;s government illegitimate. It &#8220;isn&#8217;t democratic. I don&#8217;t support this current situation in the east of Ukraine,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In Donetsk and Lugansk regions. He called attacking Eastern Ukrainians &#8220;completely wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, he &#8220;maintains complete objectivity and neutrality as a correspondent.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bulletproof jacket and helmet were confiscated. He’s unharmed so far, he said. Incommunicado since cut off there&#8217;s no way to know for sure.</p>
<p>Right Sector thugs targeted him. They put a bounty on his head. They offered $10,000 for his capture.</p>
<p>They called him a &#8220;Russian spy.&#8221; His life&#8217;s endanger in their hands. Or in sight to be shot in cold blood.</p>
<p>Radicalized Kiev elements posted a Facebook comment. He &#8220;works for terrorists,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;(H)e photographs and publishes the location of Ukrainian troops…&#8221;</p>
<p>He &#8220;spreads disinformation. (He publishes) Putin&#8217;s propaganda in the media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be immediately detained by Ukrainian forces ad deported from Ukraine.&#8221; Orders come from &#8220;EuroMaidan leaders,&#8221; it claimed.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s Foreign Ministry condemned his detention. Its human rights commissioner Konstantin Dolgov called it media obstruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is another step…made by Ukrainian authorities to curb the activities of unwanted journalists,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They &#8220;work professionally and show an objective picture, the ugly side of the outrages made by ultranationalists, the results of (Kiev putschists&#8217;) punitive operation in the southeast,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>Seizing Phillips constitutes an &#8220;unlawful seizure, detention of Russian journalists.&#8221; Moscow demands all lawlessly detained media representatives be released.</p>
<p>Kiev &#8220;continues its vicious line,&#8221; Dolgov added. Coup-appointed officials spurn their &#8220;international obligations concerning freedom of speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>They target media freedom. They want it eliminated altogether. They want their message alone reported. They want truth buried.</p>
<p>They want fascist putschist power enhanced. They deplore democratic values.</p>
<p>They want ordinary Ukrainians having no say. Polls show their popularity eroding. They risk losing it overwhelmingly.</p>
<p>Perhaps nationwide rebellion will follow. When ruthlessness exceeds levels too great to tolerate, all bets are off.</p>
<p>The only solution is nonviolent revolution. Perhaps just a matter of time. It can&#8217;t happen a moment too soon.</p>

			<h4>Origin of the Master Model</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/modern-slavery.jpg" alt="" />The master plan for world domination we see playing out today was first proposed to the US at the end of World War I. However, there were no takers. People were too war weary. However, when the plan was again proposed at the end of World War II, it was accepted. Consequently, World War II quietly transitioned into the secret “war” to set up what has become known as the “new world order” — an absolute dictatorship over the entire planet.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States set up the School of the Americas to train future dictators and terrorists who would be sent out into the world to destroy sovereign nations and place them under US domination by installing puppet governments obedient to the United States. Many conquests were made quietly using clever economic tricks <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>. However, leaders who refused to submit quietly would see their entire country reduced to rubble and the land rendered unlivable by uranium dust scattered by US bombs. The message was clear: Submit to the United States or face total destruction.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A social model based upon the assumption that cleverness and power automatically convey the right to take anything desired from those who are less adept and unable to resist is not a sustainable model for harmonious social interactions. However, this is the chosen model. The mantra for this model, “A man’s true worth is measured by the amount of other peoples’ happiness that he can <em>possess </em>and <em>destroy</em>” <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote1" name="fn1">[1]</a>, is essentially a call for a class war between the greedy elite and the innocent masses of the world who simply desire a peaceful existence.</p>
<h4>Acquisitions</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States looks at the rest of the world as a “resource”. If a country has something — oil, gold, minerals, etc. — that the US covets, it believes it has the right to take those things by whatever means necessary. In many cases the coveted resource is human slave labor. Let’s look at some representative examples:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/US_ThirdWorld/US_Guat.html" target="_blank">Guatemala: The Banana Wars</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With the cooperation of the dictator, United Fruit Company (US) owned almost half of the country and used the locals as slaves to harvest its Chiquita brand bananas. However, during the period from 1945-1954 new leaders made changes. They helped the poor and set up social security and health care. Then they took land away from United Fruit and gave it to the local people. United fruit complained to the CIA that its business interests were being interfered with by the “communist” government. Any government which shows kindness to the poor and weak is called communist by the US. The US attacked Guatemala — killed the elected leaders and many thousands of citizens — and established a puppet dictatorship which would obey the will of United Fruit. The people were returned to a state of slavery. The CIA trained death squads to make sure the people were crushed into submission.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Strip Mining in Africa <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote4" name="fn4">[4]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In Africa, the International Monetary Fund — a puppet of the US — destroys a country with strip mining. The original country was self sustaining. People were able to grow lots of food and hunt animals. However, once the land was ruined by US corporations, it was unusable to plant crops and the native animals died. The people had to buy food from other countries with money loaned to them by the IMF which they could never hope to repay. Therefore, a once free and self supporting people were made debt slaves of the IMF. Once all the natural resources have been stolen, the corporations will simply pack up and leave the indigenous people to starve and die.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Countries Used as Trash Dumps <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote5" name="fn5">[5]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Used computers and associated items are dumped in poor countries where starving barefoot children sift through the mess of hazardous waste and broken obsolete glass computer monitors hoping to find something they can sell to get enough money to stay alive another day. Property stickers show the waste is mainly from the US government and various US state governments.</p>
<h4>Corruption of Trusted Sources</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reporters and News Organizations</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The masses are conditioned to believe news they receive from establishment sources. In the earlier times, this assumption was often correct. It was considered so important by the founding fathers that freedom of the press was enshrined in the US constitution. However, times have changed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Walter Cronkite was known as the “trusted voice”. No one knew he was also the official announcer at the secret Bohemian Grove meetings. The leaders of the world’s news organizations also attend this event. That is why, even though the meetings began over one hundred years ago, until recently no one knew this group even existed. President George W. Bush may have set a new record for bribing journalists to allow their trusted name to be used as the author of material actually written by government propaganda experts. Apparently, everyone has a price and the government, of course, has no problem when it comes to money.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When Ronald Reagan reportedly ordered the death of investigative reporter Jessica Savitch <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote6" name="fn6">[6]</a>, the message to independent journalists was clear: Go against the official party line an you’re done!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, dedicated journalists face mysterious deaths and strange single car accidents but a few survive long enough to give us a glimpse of truths we would otherwise never know. They are true heroes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Churches</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are everywhere. Unfortunately, legitimate Spiritual teachers are not. People look at churches either as harmless or with some sort of conditioned hypnotic respect. Churches send out “missionaries”. However, the “mission” of these missionaries may not be so clear. If you wanted to infiltrate a foreign country, these people would be an ideal asset.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are not Spiritual centers. At best, all they want is your money. At worst, they are Satanic and you are in severe Spiritual danger if you come under their influence and control.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Catholic Church has been a trusted asset of the US intelligence community for quite some time. Significant information obtained by priests during confessions is routinely passed on to the government.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This agreement predates the internet by many years. Because the church has branches in almost every country, it has great potential for covert activities. For example, if you need to get an operative who is in danger out of a country, they can go to a Catholic church for “confession”. Once the door is closed, they can exit through a secret passage, be disguised in robes and spirited safely out of the country. Church secrecy is at least on a par with US secrecy. Also, the Catholic church and the US shadow government share the same Satanic value system and engage in child rape and ritual killings.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Doctors and the Medical Industry</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Medicine in the United States is an industry. It is no longer a profession. Its corporate model puts profit above all else. If some patients accidentally benefit they are the lucky ones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The medical community has a rigid hierarchical structure and effective mechanisms for enforcing secrecy. Essentially, its model closely resembles the military chain of command structure. This makes it a perfect partner for the government in the area of secret human experiments.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, when the government was doing radiation experiments on humans, a doctor or someone dressed as a doctor would just walk up to unsuspecting patients and inject them with radioactive material. They were then secretly followed for years to see what would happen. Eventually, some of those who survived were told the truth. Most people used in the MK Ultra and subsequent secret projects were never notified.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Hospitals are set up to protect themselves. Staff may appear to be dedicated, smiling people who truly care about you. However, they are basically prostitutes who are being nice because you are worth money to them. When they make mistakes they have a “loss prevention” department staffed by clever lawyers who are trained to protect the financial interests of the hospital by denying everything and fabricating believable coverups. They are trained to do whatever is necessary. The staff will all agree to support whatever lies are needed. They know their job and their financial future depends upon maintaining strict secrecy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The only people who receive legitimate medical care are the select elite cleared to access<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>. These people always get excellent care because the doctors work for the shadow government and mistakes on their part are simply not tolerated.</p>
<h4>Infiltrations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Countries which have the resources to sustain an intelligence community generally try to get operatives (spies) into other countries so they can directly observe activities. When real people gather intelligence, this is called <em>human intelligence </em>or HUMINT. The US, of course, does this too. However, you may not be aware of the extent to which the US also infiltrates itself. The central government really does not trust anyone.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Essentially all local police departments, state offices and state governors have a covert federal agent working close by pretending to be just another employee. Also, every US neighborhood has an informer who reports to the federal government. Large corporations, which tend to behave like “mini governments”, need to be infiltrated and kept under observation. Colleges and universities are also monitored.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here is how this spy network operates: The NSA likes to recruit young kids right out of college. When they are hired and sworn to secrecy they still do not know what their assignment will be. They must agree to do this assignment without first being told what it is.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Some agents, like John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>, are assigned to work in other countries. However, others are assigned to work inside the US. Their assignment could be to go to some state and apply to join the local police department. They would pretend to be just a regular person looking for a job. They would take the necessary training and spend their life as a local policeman so they could directly observe other local police from the inside and report to the NSA. Since they are actually an employee of the NSA, presumably they get to keep both salaries and, eventually, both retirements. All significant local police forces in the US are infiltrated this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Additionally, some agents will be assigned to get a job on the state governor’s staff as well as in major local state agencies. A CIA or NSA agent is always on the staff at major colleges and universities. The same goes for major corporations.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Senior level agents are allowed to have special TV receivers in their homes linked to the secret government TV network. This way everyone stays on the same page. The channels on this network actually broadcast the truth. TV channels available to ordinary people contain only government approved propaganda mixed with “bread and circuses” presentations to make sure the <em>sheeple </em>stay asleep and content.</p>
<h4>Fronts</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US government is involved in illegal activities internationally and domestically. If it performed these activities overtly in the name of the United States, there would be serious consequences under both international and local laws. To avoid this situation, the US government operates thousands of “front organizations” which appear to be private but are actually shadow operatives of the US.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a> explained that he was recruited, hired and trained by the NSA. He was an NSA agent. However, for his cover as an <em>economic hit man</em>, he “officially” worked for a “private” company called Charles T. Main. This company was a government front to shield the US because the activities the NSA trained Perkins to do were illegal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is standard operating procedure for the US as well as other countries and many corporations. It shields them from legal recourse by providing deniability for the crimes they actually direct and commit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Generally, when the US wants to influence other sovereign countries, it creates harmless looking NGO’s which appear to be independent but are actually fronts for covert activities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Domestically, colleges and universities — especially those with associated medical schools and hospitals — are great places to conceal a variety of covert projects such as the MK Ultra series of human experiments which, reportedly, continue today using new cover names. The US also likes to create non-profit corporations which exist only to provide classified services to the United States. A good example would be the Institutes for Defense Analysis (IDA). The US, reportedly, is its only client.</p>
<h4>Programming</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Mass media “programming” is actually programming you. It has developed into a subtle form of mind control. Before radio and television, special interests recognized that motion pictures could be used to alter public opinion in their favor. Perhaps, for example, you wanted to attack labor unions. When radio and later television came along providing access to national and international audiences, the temptation to exploit these technologies became irresistible. Originally, the US government recognized this and set up fairness rules to prevent monopolies from taking over the broadcast media and blocking opposing viewpoints. All this ended, unfortunately, when Ronald Regan canceled all the fairness regulations. Today, a handful of powerful corporations own and control essentially all content delivered by radio and television.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Television is the main vehicle for mass indoctrination. It is said that people watching TV actually fall into a light hypnotic trance. The “entertainment” you see on TV does not “just happen to be there”. It is very carefully planned and timed to attract and influence targeted audiences. It is said that if some event were to somehow shut down all television broadcasts the government would experience a severe crisis because it would lose control over the minds of the masses.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">TV creates sort of a “hive mind” among the masses and keeps everyone coordinated and tuned into the official party line. Without this, people would have no choice but to start thinking for themselves and forming independent opinions. Clearly, this would be a disaster.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The radio broadcast of “War of the Worlds” and the later movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still” are said to be CIA psychological experiments to judge how the general public would react to some type of ET contact.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, broadcasting is not just a one way event. Because people react to events and use social media to express these reactions, the effect of specific propaganda can be analyzed in real time. Since the government now intercepts all electronic communications, it is able to see general opinions and then tweak algorithms to maximize the desired effect of propaganda. This ability makes TV a two-way communications system although most people, of course, do not realize this and have no concept of the level of sophistication these technologies have reached.</p>
<h4>Information Theory</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Information Theory is the name of a relatively new branch of science which became popular in the 1960′s. It covers a broad range of technologies. Basically, it is the science of the flow of information and how that flow can be selectively controlled so that information flows only in desired pathways. As you may have already guessed, governments love this sort of stuff.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>ECM</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">ECM stands for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">El</span>ectronic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co</span>unter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span>asures. In general, these are techniques to disable other electronic devices. Basically, it is electronic warfare. When the secret service is active in an area, for example, they will selectively jam all radio frequencies except for the specific frequencies they are using so that no one else can communicate.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">World leaders, who are generally terrified of “threats” materializing from practically anywhere, like to travel with ECM generators running just in case “someone” from “somewhere” was trying to target them for “some reason”. Basically, they are paranoid whack jobs.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People familiar with aviation tell the story of how Tony Blair, while traveling to or near a commercial airport, reportedly caused a commercial jet to crash because all the ECM garbage he was transmitting jammed the plane’s navigation system. Of course, the British government would never admit this.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secure Communication With Submarines</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7754" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-1.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="315" />Since submarines were invented, communicating with them has been a problem because conventional radio waves will not travel underwater. Therefore, early submarines had to get close enough to the surface to put up some kind of antenna in the air to send or receive radio messages. Obviously, this could pose a problem if you did not wish to be discovered and located. After all, the motivation to create submarines in the first place was the feeling that they would be able to move about the planet secretly. However, newer technologies now make this impossible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To solve the problem of reliable secure communication without the need to surface, scientists learned that sea water was essentially transparent to a special type of Argon laser. To set up the current communications network, it was decided to use several satellites with each satellite sending only part of an encrypted communication signal. The complete signal could only be received at a specific point underwater where all the laser beams intersected. Intercepting only one or two beams would prove useless. This communications system is considered to be impossible to intercept.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Quantum Entanglement</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Returning to the submarine issue for a moment, before modern communications were perfected, there was a search for some reliable method to send a signal to a submerged submarine that could not be detected. This was considered necessary in a war situation to secretly transmit an attack command. What they originally did was to locate a couple of people who could communicate telepathically. One would be at the command base and the other on the submarine. Doing a bit more research, it was determined that this type of communication is instantaneous and somehow operated outside of time. Radio waves travel at the speed of light.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Quantum entanglement is a process which uses technology to send and receive signals outside of space-time. Now, why would you possibly want to do this? Well, if you had a base or a colony on a planet in some other solar system light years away, you would not want to wait years for messages to be received. Following this thread — and adding some basic common sense — why would you want to dedicate resources to search for habitable planets in distant solar systems when you had already “proven” it would be impossible to ever get there? Could it just be that someone is not coming clean with whole story?</p>
<h4>The Separation Barrier</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a model of the separation barrier which insulates the ruling class from the slave class. It is essentially “intellectual apartheid”. The question is, why is it there. It takes considerable effort, money and manpower to maintain this artificial barrier. What is the reasoning behind not having a level playing field for everyone? Why does this idea absolutely terrify the elite? What are they afraid of?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Pirate Story</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a summary of a story told years ago on a radio broadcast most likely by Paul Harvey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinary people were afraid. The Earth was flat so they dare not venture far from home. Periodically, a pirate ship would come. They did not know how it got there or from where it came. It brought treasures they had never seen. The Chief Pirate would encourage the young men to study and specialize in specific skills. He wanted them to become educated but only in one narrow area. The Chief Pirate knew the world was not flat and how to navigate to other lands. However, this knowledge was never discussed. This “top secret” knowledge or the “big picture of the known world” would only be given to the Chief Pirate’s son who would inherit his title and someday become the Chief Pirate.</p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">This story is about the origin of the concept we call <em>compartmentalization</em> — the process of controlling the slave masses by only allowing them to know specific bits of the truth while the leaders are allowed to know total truth.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Leaders can only maintain their status if there are slaves. Otherwise, everyone would be equal and operate on a level playing field. This means “leaders” would have to pull their own weight like everyone else. Clearly, this would be intolerable. Leaders love beautiful and exotic things but don’t want to do the work needed to create these things. They probably could not even plant a garden much less build the various “ivory towers” where they like to live surrounded by servants. If left on their own they would very likely starve. This is why it is so important to create and maintain the complex separation barrier.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Why don’t people who live above the separation barrier ever “come down” and talk to the people below the barrier? Well, other than the obvious fact that they would likely be killed or jailed for espionage or treason, there is another, simpler, reason.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Would you like to spend your days sitting in an open field with kindergarten kids looking for four leaf clovers? Probably not. You have progressed beyond that. The slaves below the separation barrier cannot even imagine the world of those who live above the barrier. In fact, the elite do not even consider the slaves human. They call them “disposable biological units”. The United Nations prefers the slang term “the herd”. Slaves can be easily bred in quantities needed and programmed to do desired tasks. Then, they can be easily disposed of when no longer useful. That’s how they look at you. So, why would they want to make friends with you?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Mars Example</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is an interesting event playing out today that you may have noticed. This concerns the recruitment and selection of people to be sent to Mars. There are simulation projects where volunteers are locked away to imitate the long voyage to Mars. They are being told that this is a one way trip and they can never hope to return to Earth.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What you are witnessing is the selection process for the “seed people” who will be used to breed the future slave class on Mars. In a situation similar to the period when most believed the Earth was flat and you would fall off if you tried to go to sea, these people are convinced that the only way to get to mars is to ride a rocket on a perilous journey taking years. Because they truly believe this, when they get to Mars, they will teach this crap to their kids along with other misconceptions like it is impossible to go faster than the speed of light and other associated obsolete scientific principles. They will have no<br />
desire to ever return to Earth or go anywhere else because they truly believe it is not possible. They will be contented slaves.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course the truth is that there are already secret colonies on Mars. It is not that hard to get there using antigravity and other secret propulsion methods and it is quite likely possible to simply walk through some kind of wormhole device and come out on Mars.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, the slaves will never know this. Just as it is done on Earth, there will be an artificial separation barrier. The insiders will know the truth and will be physically hidden from the slaves. There will be secret police and other methods — the same as are used on Earth — to make sure no slave ever escapes from the “information prison”. Business as usual will continue.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reinforcement of Ignorance</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Governments and their oligarchs love to keep their subjects in a cloud of ignorance. Back in the days when people believed the Earth was flat, the inner circle ruling class knew it was round. Maintaining the deception was convenient because it kept the slaves from developing any desire to travel far from home.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Nothing has changed all that much today. Consider, for example, all the fuss over the missing MH370 plane. You are being played for a sucker. It is impossible for that plane to have “disappeared”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US DoD spy satellite system reportedly consists of ten constellations of satellites. Each constellation has over seven thousand satellites. They see and record everything that happens on this planet. The floor of the oceans can be seen just as clearly as the land areas. The resolution of the system is better than one square millimeter. Also, everything is recorded so you can go back in time and play past images.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7756" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-2.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="141" />This is a picture of a common electric lamp. Take this lamp and throw it in the ocean — any ocean anywhere on this planet. The spy satellite system will locate it, give you the coordinates and give you a photo at least as good as the one above. That is the capability of the system. So, clearly, it is impossible not to know the location of something as large as a Boeing 777 plane. All the TV publicity is a choreographed play. You are being scammed and you need to wake up and realize this fact.</p>
<h4>Murders and Assassinations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">To ensure a strong empire, dissent must be crushed. The United States trains assassins and carries out both domestic and foreign murders and assassinations on a regular basis. You may be familiar with the classic movie scenes where a black limousine with tinted windows drives by a target with thugs shooting machine guns. Although this would accomplish the task, it is a bit too obvious in a country that advertises itself to be a free, civilized democracy. Someone might catch on and begin to doubt the party line. Consequently, these things must be done quietly.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Inside the US, murders are reportedly carried out by a group known as “FBI Division Five”. Other agencies likely have the responsibility for foreign assassinations. However, the basic techniques used would be similar.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Typically, an agent would wake up every day and connect to the top secret internet to see who he was assigned to kill that day. There would be several options. If it was important to eliminate the target immediately, a fast acting chemical agent would be selected which, for example, would cause the target to die within a few hours of a “natural” heart attack.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, if time was not critical and the government just wanted the target out of the way, you might want to select one of the cancer causing agents such as those likely used to eliminate Hugo Chavez and Senator Ted Kennedy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is also a third possibility. This involves character assassination instead of actual murder. Consider, for example, a person who has gained a lot of public recognition talking about, say, free energy. If you simply kill the person, there could be blowback and talk that he was silenced by the government. In such cases, it is easier to use a chemical agent designed not to kill but, rather, to cause states of mental confusion resulting in obviously strange behavior. This would be coordinated with the government controlled mainstream press to make sure everyone became convinced the person was a nut and would therefore ignore anything said without regard to the truth or validity of the message.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once the appropriate chemical has been selected, you need to load it into the secret delivery system and locate your target. To find your target you will connect to the top secret internet and pinpoint the location of the target through their cell phone. You can also activate all the cameras and microphones in electronic gadgets connected to the internet associated with the target in case you wish to look around the target’s home and hear in real time what is taking place.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, this will not help you locate the target when it is time to actually do the hit. So, you need to get the top secret profile data which will show any predictable habits of the target. Everyone is constantly tracked through their cell phones and profiles are logged and stored. In this case, the profile shows that the target has a favorite restaurant and goes there for lunch every day around 11:30. Now, you know exactly what to do. You go to the restaurant, hang out until you see your target, and get in line behind the target. Now, all you need to do is slightly bump into the target to deliver the chemical. Generally, the targets never even notice.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This mission is now complete. If it is early enough, you can check back in to the top secret system to see who you are supposed to kill next. Just another day. Just a routine job.</p>
<h4>Money</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>Money</em> is an imaginary force. It is used to motivate and control slaves. Real forces effect all life forms. However, only people respond to money. The only reason they do is because they have been artificially programmed to do so.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money can be created in unlimited quantities by those adept in the use of this force. The physical world is finite, however the world of imagination is not. There is no limit to the quantity of money that can be imagined into existence. Money can also be imagined out of existence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Let’s assume that one day the entire financial system simply disappeared. If you lived in a rural area and had a nice veggie garden, some friendly chickens, collection facilities for rain water and a few photocells for electricity, you would not notice this. The veggies would continue to grow. Rain would periodically fall. The chickens would lay eggs as usual. The sun would continue to shine. However, if you lived in a city environment, you would be devastated.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Before money, people lived in small hunter-gatherer groups. The concept of ownership did not exist. People worked and survived as a group. Men and women were equal. Everyone contributed to the community. Resources were shared equally. The concept of “mine” and “yours” did not exist. Women generally became pregnant only once about every three years although there was no birth control. Later, when the concept of money entered the consciousness, women were seen as having less value because men were paid for work but women were not paid to raise and care for kids. Society has changed, however, the downgraded status of women has not.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money systems have always been manipulated by clever people. When gold was used as money, people learned they could dilute pure gold with silver or maybe even lead to come up with something that looked like pure gold and had the correct weight but was a fraud. A king suspected he was being scammed but had no way to prove it. He called on the great minds of the time for help. This led to what is known as the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://faculty.weber.edu/ewalker/Chem2990/Chem%202990%20Specific%20Gravity%20Readings.pdf" target="_blank">Archimedes’ principle</a> which is better known today as “specific gravity”. This principle made it possible to compare a sample known to be pure gold to a questionable sample and prove the unknown sample was not pure gold. Likely, some clever crook lost his head once this test became known.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is a general belief that gold is the ultimate reference for all money. However, secrets concerning the exact quantity of gold make this a perilous assumption. Reportedly, the United States stole a tremendous quantity of physical gold from Japan towards the end of World War II. This gold exists off the books. To make matters worse, Japan was not all that concerned. Japan had been using gold bars as ballast on its ships because they were compact and heavy. They thought nothing of throwing the bars overboard as necessary. Japan used platinum as a money reference and the US never got that. This should make one rethink all the hype about the value of gold. It may be a lot more plentiful than we have been led to believe. Also, the secret off the books stashes of gold would allow its relative value to be manipulated at will just like other commodity markets.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Financial Axis of Evil <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote3" name="fn3">[3]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7755" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-3.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="231" />This is the model of the financial axis of evil which rules this planet. It consists of three main branches as shown above. Collectively, they are known as “The Empire of the City”. Briefly, here is how this system operates:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The London financial district is in London, Washington D.C. is in the United States and the Vatican is in Italy. However, these three places are not part of the countries where they exist. They are independent “city states” and have their own laws and constitution. They are, effectively, “mini countries” inside of other countries and fly their own flags. The city state of London is a private corporation and pays no taxes to actual London or to Britain. The city state of London is the master power center and is controlled by the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm" target="_blank">Rothschild family</a> which considers itself to be the legal owner of this planet. The Vatican is the largest private land owner in the world and the first true multinational corporation with installations (churches) and secret agents (The Knights of Malta) everywhere. They control through the power of fear of the unknown and practice black magic. Washington D.C. relies upon brute military force. All three closely cooperate combining their specialties of financial trickery, witchcraft and military might. Of course, all three worship Satan as their Master.</p>
<h4>Slavery</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Slavery is alive and well throughout the world. The US constitution prohibits slavery, however, most americans live in slave-like conditions.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is said that it will take the average college student until age fifty to pay back their student loan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery addressed the concept of physically owning another person. However, it did not address the issue of holding another person in bondage as a debt slave. It also did not consider the concept of private for profit prisons who force inmates to work as slaves. These systems exist today and are perfectly legal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Actually, a recent report from prestigious Princeton University has reclassified the US government as an oligarchy — a country run by and for the rich elite. Former US President Carter has stated that the United States “no longer has a functioning democracy”. So much for the Founding Father’s dream. Speaking of dreams, check out the free you tube video titled “The American Dream”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Other forms of slavery are illegal but still flourish. Sex slaves are always in demand. Traffickers are sometimes caught but you need to realize that your leaders use sex slaves and also routinely abuse young girls and boys. Sometimes they are also killed during occult rituals. No one ever talks about this and these people are never punished. This has been the normal way of life for Satan worshipers for many years and nothing has changed or is likely to ever change in the future. Stanley Kubrick’s last movie, <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>, covers this subject. Some believe this intense dramatization of how the elite really live may have cost him his life.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People still have some rights left in the United States but other countries are a different story. Qatar is doing construction for the World Cup. The event is not scheduled until the year 2022, however they have <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/2022-world-cup-qatar-accused-3303458" target="_blank">already killed 1200 slaves</a> <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote7" name="fn7">[7]</a> by working them to death. People are lured from poor countries with the promise of jobs and money. When they arrive, their passports are confiscated and they are forced to work until they literally drop dead. If the World Cup is actually held in Qatar in 2022, there will be glamorous TV coverage and no one will remember or care about all the dead slaves. The show must go on.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Qatar, incidentally, sponsors Al Jazeera TV network.</p>
<h4>Adaptation Techniques</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The status quo of today will never change because the people who created it will never die. Because of <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>, when men like Henry Kissinger, who heads the Bilderberg Group’s steering committee, get too feeble to function, they will simply go to one of the secret locations and use the temporal reversal device to regress back to about twenty years old. Their memories will be unaffected. Then they will get new identities and continue on. This process can be repeated indefinitely.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Because you can never change the status quo, your best hope for a lifetime of reasonable quality is to find clever ways to live in this world with as much independence as possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">One method of adaptation is autonomous and semi-autonomous communities. If the community is registered as a religious institution it is automatically shielded from most government interference by the US constitution. It pays no taxes and can pretty much write its own rules by simply calling whatever it wants to do “religious doctrine”. Many small semi-autonomous groups exist where people who share a common set of values find ways to quietly live out their lives pretty much on their own terms. The government does not seem interested in bothering these smaller groups as long as they live peacefully and are not doing anything that the government perceives to be a threat.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Amish people are a good example of an autonomous group. You would probably not want to live as they do, however, before you completely dismiss them, you may want to look at some definite advantages in their chosen lifestyle.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Remember, these are the people who reject technology. They just might have made the correct choice. Technology, at first, seemed like a good idea. However, now that people are addicted to technology they are also enslaved by technology. Everything they do is monitored and recorded by the government. Privacy no longer exists. It did not have to be this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Technology, in itself, is not evil. However, it can be quite evil if you live under a government run by sociopathic control freaks which, unfortunately, you do. In the Amish world, electronic surveillance does not exist because electronic devices do not exist. The constant propaganda from TV has no effect on people who do not have TV. A horse does not report its position to a GPS satellite and is not controlled by a computer.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Also, the people are generally healthy and do not suffer from many diseases common to the mainstream population. They are not being poisoned by fluorinated water or additives found in processed food because they don’t use these things. Also, they get lots of physical exercise.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Without totally withdrawing from the world, there are some positive steps you can take. By now you know never to drink fluorinated water or use any personal product containing fluoride such as many brands of toothpaste. To minimize harmful food additives, look for Kosher food which is marked with either the encircled “K” or “U” (Ultra Kosher). These foods have less or no harmful additives. The Jewish community is very protective of its people and the Mossad is widely considered to be the best intelligence service in the world. Therefore, they would have the inside scoop on everything including food and do not want to see their people harmed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Whatever you decide to do, you definitely do not want to be part of so called mainstream society. These people are doomed. They are sheep (<em>sheeple</em>) slowly walking to the slaughter house. Don’t go there!</p>
