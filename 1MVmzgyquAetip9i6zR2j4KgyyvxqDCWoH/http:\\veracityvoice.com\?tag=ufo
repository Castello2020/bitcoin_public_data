<p>On 28 November 1953, at 2 am, a man crashed through a closed window and fell to his death from the 10th floor of the Statler Hotel in New York City. He was identified as Frank Olson, a bacteriologist with the US Army Research Center at Fort Detrick, Maryland. He had fallen from a room he shared with another scientist, Robert Lashbrook. It was ruled a suicide.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years later, in 1975, William Colby, then CIA director, declassified documents that changed the complexion of the case. It was revealed that Olson had actually been an undercover CIA operative at Fort Detrick, and that one week prior to his death, he had been drinking Cointreau at a high-level meeting with scientists at Deep Creek Lodge in rural Maryland. The Cointreau was laced with a large dose of LSD administered by his CIA boss, Sidney Gottlieb. He was then sent to New York with Lashbrook, also with the CIA, to see a psychiatrist because the LSD had induced a psychosis.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that Olson had been part of the top secret CIA program that was known as Project MK-ULTRA, exploring the use of chemicals and <a title="PsyWar: A Short History of the Battle for the Mind" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/24/psywar-a-short-history-of-the-battle-for-the-mind/">drugs for purposes of mind control</a>, and bacteriological agents for covert assassination. Olson had been working on ways to deliver anthrax in aerosol form, for use as a weapon. New evidence that came to light, through the persistent efforts of Olson’s son Eric, made the suicide ruling highly suspect.</p>
<p>It turned out that Olson had been labelled a security risk by British intelligence after getting upset witnessing human experimentation on a trip to Frankfurt, Germany the previous summer. Eric Olson now believes that his father was drugged and then murdered to make sure that he didn’t reveal the secrets of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1441499733/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1441499733&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">MK-ULTRA project</a>. Following the 1975 revelations, the government must have felt more than a little guilt about the affair because Olson’s family was given a 17 minute audience with US President Ford, who apologised to them, and they were awarded damages in the amount of $750,000.</p>
<p><strong>Controlling Human Behaviour</strong></p>
<p>The MK-ULTRA program was instituted on 13 April 1953 by CIA Director Allen Dulles, ostensibly to counter the brainwashing techniques of American prisoners being held by the North Koreans during the Korean War, and to duplicate those techniques on enemy prisoners, i.e. the creation of “Manchurian Candidates.” This was the claim used to obtain funding for the project. However, the Prisoner of War brainwashing program was just the tip of the iceberg, and the CIA-sponsored experiments ventured far and wide into areas of Mind Control under the aegis of MK-ULTRA that had little or nothing to do with methods of interrogation.</p>
<p>The Colby revelations were part of a sweeping investigation of the CIA in January 1975 by the “Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States,” chaired by Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller. The subsequent June 1975 Report to the President said: “The drug program was part of a much larger CIA program to study possible means for controlling human behaviour. Other studies explored the effects of radiation, electric-shock, psychology, psychiatry, sociology and harassment substances.”</p>
<p>Even though the program got off to a rocky start with the Olson affair, it recovered quickly and became an umbrella project with 149 sub-projects. The overall guiding principal was succinctly stated in an internal CIA memo dated January 1952: “Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature such as self-preservation?”<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>The drug program came under the aegis of the Chemical Division of the Technical Services Staff headed up by Sidney Gottlieb from 1951 to 1956. Gottlieb was a highly intelligent eccentric who drank goat’s milk, enjoyed folk-dancing, and raised Christmas trees on his farm outside Washington.</p>
<p>The Agency funded <a title="Are Psychedelic Drugs the Next Frontier in Wellness Research?" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/09/26/can-lsd-help-cure-depression/">LSD research programs</a> at major medical centres and universities including Boston Psychopathic, Mt. Sinai Hospital at Columbia University, University of Illinois Medical School, University of Oklahoma and others. The funding was carried out secretly through the Josiah Macy Foundation, and the Geschickter Fund for Medical Research in Washington, D.C. The CIA claimed the secrecy was necessary to keep it from the Russians, but we have already seen that it was part of much larger project to <a title="The Illuminati: Renegades of the Mystery Schools" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/17/the-illuminati-renegades-of-the-mystery-schools/">learn how to control human behaviour</a> in general, so this is not credible.</p>
<p>Gottlieb told Dr. Harold Abramson at Mt. Sinai (who just happened to be the psychiatrist that Olson was supposed to see!) that he wanted “operationally pertinent materials [about]: a. Disturbance of Memory; b. Discrediting by Aberrant Behaviour; c. Alteration of Sex Patterns; d. Eliciting of Information; e. Suggestibility; f. Creation of Dependence.” That sounds like pretty deep stuff for the spy game. They were really afraid of public reaction and congressional condemnation, especially since the CIA charter did not allow domestic operations, and certainly prohibited experimentation on US citizens.</p>
<p>The callousness of the research is best exemplified by the CIA-funded work of Dr. Harris Isbell, the Director of the Addiction Research Center in Lexington, Kentucky. The drug addict hospital inmates, who were mostly black, were encouraged to volunteer for LSD research in return for hard drugs of their choice or time off their sentences. In most cases, they were given pure morphine or heroin. At one point Isbell kept seven men on LSD for 77 straight days. Many others were on it for up to 42 days.</p>
<p>Concerning extended LSD usage, John Marks in his landmark book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393307948/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0393307948&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind Control</em></a> says about writer Hunter S. Thompson (recently deceased) that he “frightened his readers with accounts of drug (LSD) binges lasting a few days, during which Thompson felt his brain boiling away in the sun, his nerves wrapping around enormous barbed wire forts, and his remaining faculties reduced to their reptilian antecedents.” The recent movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ISJQ1W/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B006ISJQ1W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>The Rum Diary</em></a>,<em> </em>starring Johnny Depp, based on the autobiographical book by Hunter S. Thompson, presents an imaginative re-enactment of his LSD adventures.</p>
<h3>The CIA Turns On the Counter-Culture</h3>
<p>Not satisfied with university research, Gottlieb recruited New York narcotics agent George White to distribute LSD surreptitiously to the “borderline underworld.” Operating through safe houses in Greenwich Village, Haight-Ashbury and Marin County, White gave doses to prostitutes, pimps, drug addicts and other “marginal people” and then observed the results and reported to Gottlieb.</p>
<p>John Marks says they were people “who would be powerless to seek any sort of revenge if they ever found out what the CIA had done to them. In addition to their being unlikely whistle-blowers, such people lived in a world where an unwitting dose of some drug… was an occupational hazard anyway.”</p>
<p>Eventually, White started using it randomly all over New York and San Francisco. Regarding the results, Marks says, “The MKULTRA scientists reaped little but disaster, mischief, and disappointment from their efforts to use LSD as a miracle weapon against the minds of their opponents.” Yet, they continued this program for 10 years until 1963.</p>
<p>Ironically, since the CIA had pretty much cornered the market on LSD internationally, buying up all the product of Sandoz and Eli Lilly, the spread of the drug to the counter-culture was through the Agency.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Timothy%20Leary&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Timothy Leary</a>, Ken Kesey, Allen Ginsburg and Tom Wolfe were first “turned on” thanks to the CIA, and that’s how the “flower children” became psychedelic.</p>
<p>But, the LSD experiments may have been more successful than Marks realised. They were carefully noting the precise effects on brain chemistry, and in the six areas that Gottlieb was concerned with: memory disturbance, aberrant behaviour, altered sexual patterns, eliciting information, suggestibility and creation of dependence. This became evident when they started using LSD as an adjunct in hypnotic and electronic experiments.</p>
<h3>Re-Patterning the Brain</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most notorious and nefarious MK-ULTRA sub-project was carried out at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada under the directorship of Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, an American from Albany, New York. Cameron had trained at the Royal Mental Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, under eugenicist Sir David Henderson, and founded the Canadian branch of the World Federation for Mental Health. At various times, he was elected president of the Canadian, American, and World psychiatric associations. In other words, Cameron was no renegade but had the full faith and endorsement of the world psychiatric establishment.</p>
<p>The CIA wanted Cameron to “depattern” the contents of the brain to make it receptive to new patterning. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=David%20Remnick&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">David Remnick</a> in a <em>Washington Post </em>article on 28 July 1985 said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The…. heart of the laboratory was the Grid Room…. The subject was strapped into a chair involuntarily, by force, his head bristling with electrodes and transducers. Any resistance was met with a paralysing dose of curare. The subject’s brainwaves were beamed to a nearby reception room crammed with voice analysers, a wire recorder and radio receivers cobbled together… The systematic annihilation or ‘depatterning’ of a subject’s mind and memory was accomplished with overdoses of LSD, barbiturate sleep for 65 days at a stretch and ECT shocks at 75 times the recommended dosage. Psychic driving, the repetition of a recorded message for 16 hours a day, programmed the empty mind. Fragile patients referred to Allan Memorial for help were thus turned into carbuncular jellyfish.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930852923/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0930852923&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Anton Chaitkin</a> in his essay, ‘British Psychiatry: From Eugenics to Assassination’, says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Patients lost all or part of their memories, and some lost the ability to control their bodily functions and to speak. At least one patient was reduced almost to a vegetable; then Cameron had the cognitive centres of her brain surgically cut apart, while keeping her alive. Some subjects were deposited permanently in institutions for the hopelessly insane.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA funded these horrors through a front called “The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology.” Other supporters of the Allan Institute were the Rockefeller Foundation, the Geschickter Foundation, and the Canadian government.</p>
<p>About Cameron’s work, Wikipedia says: “Naomi Klein states, in her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312427999/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312427999&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">The Shock Doctrine</a>,</em> that Cameron’s research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was actually not about mind control and brainwashing, but ‘to design a scientifically based system for extracting information from “resistant sources.” In other words, torture’. And citing a book from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Alfred%20W.%20McCoy&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Alfred W. McCoy</a> it further says that ‘Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Cameron’s experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb’s earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA’s two-stage psychological torture method’.” This method was codified in the infamous “KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation Manual” published by the CIA in July 1963, and in the <em>Human Resources Exploitation Training Manual – 1983 </em>that was used in CIA training courses in Latin American countries up until 1987. These manuals describe methods of psychological torture, far more potent than physical torture, to elicit information from “resistant sources.”</p>
<h3>An Orwellian Nightmare</h3>
<p>As one would expect, the technologies now available to the mind-controllers have zoomed off the chart to the point where George Orwell’s <a title="Is Privacy History? Top 5 Ways You Are Being Digitally Monitored and Catalogued Daily" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/12/11/is-privacy-history-top-5-ways-you-are-being-digitally-monitored-and-catalogued-daily/">world of omni-surveillance</a> now seems almost quaint. Of course, it is true that 1984 was 28 years ago. But even as far back as 1970, US congressman James Scheur was able to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“As a result of spinoffs from medical, military aerospace and industrial research, we are now in the process of developing devices and products capable of controlling violent mobs without injury. We can tranquillise, impede, immobilise, harass, shock, upset, stupefy, nauseate, chill, temporarily blind, deafen or just plain scare the wits out of anyone the police have a proper need to control and restrain.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A brief survey of some of the scariest products known to be in the arsenal of the secretive alphabet agencies arrayed against John Q. Public are such devices as the Neurophone, patented by Dr. Patrick Flanagan in 1968. It converts sound to electrical impulses which can be delivered from satellites. When aimed at individuals, the impulses travel directly to the brain where the sounds are re-assembled and appear to be voices inside the head, which can be perceived as coming from God, or telepathic aliens, or whatever. Or the sounds can come out of a turned-off TV or radio. Through software, the device can mimic anyone’s voice and translate into any language.</p>
<p>It is believed that the CIA, DIA, NSA et al use the Neurophone to deliver threats and propaganda to selected targets, or just to torment someone they don’t like. One can imagine the possibilities. Could this explain some of the killings by “psychopaths” who say they were instructed by God, such as Mark David Chapman, David Berkowitz, or Sirhan Sirhan? If they had been previously evaluated through sophisticated personality assessments and groomed by LSD or hypnosis, such voices could easily tip the balance and convince them to kill.</p>
<p>We’ve all heard about the “Thought Police” and laughed because it seemed so implausible. Well, the joke is on us. <a title="Airport Scanners in 2014 – Fear and the End of Privacy" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/02/14/airport-scanners-in-2014-fear-and-the-end-of-privacy/">Brain scanning technology</a> is now well-advanced. In 1974, Lawrence Pinneo, a neurophysiologist and electronic engineer with the Stanford Research Institute succeeded in correlating brain wave patterns from EEGs with specific words. In 1994, the brain wave patterns of 40 subjects were officially correlated with both spoken words and silent thought at the University of Missouri. It is believed that US intelligence agencies now have a brain wave vocabulary of over 60,000 words in most common languages.</p>
<p>Brain waves constitute a magnetic field around the head (the aura), each person having a unique, identifiable electromagnetic signature which becomes visible through Kirlian photography, and these fields can be monitored by satellites. The translated results are then fed back to ground-side super computers at speeds of up to 20 gigabytes/second. Neurophone messages can then be beamed to selected individuals based on their thoughts. It is believed that about one million people around the globe are now monitored on a regular basis. As these numbers increase, as they certainly will, to include most educated and important people in the world, the <a title="Former Presidents Warn About the “Invisible Government” Running the United States" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/09/13/former-presidents-warn-about-the-invisible-government-running-united-states/">New World Order</a> will definitely have arrived.</p>
<p>As Australian writer Paul Baird has observed, “no-one will ever be able to even think about expressing an opinion contrary to those forced on us by the New World Order. There will literally be no intellectual property that cannot be stolen, no writing that cannot be censored, no thought that cannot be suppressed (by the most oppressive/invasive means).” Baird also claims that ex-military/intelligence whistle-blowers have reported that experiments in controlling voters with these techniques have been tried in several foreign countries. So much for democracy.</p>
<p>Other technologies, such as microwave bombardment to confuse and disorient field personnel, microchip implantation, silently delivered acoustical subliminal messages, widespread population control through psychiatric drugs, and extreme close-up satellite-based viewing able to read documents indoors, are all well-developed and in use by military and intelligence agencies. This doesn’t even address the monitoring of overt spoken and written material. Under Project ECHELON, the NSA monitors every call, fax, e-mail and computer data message in and out of the US, Canada and several other countries. Their computers then search for key words and phrases. Anything or anyone of interest draws the attention of agency operatives, who can then commence surveillance operations by the NSA or other intelligence agencies.</p>
<h3>Novel Capabilities</h3>
<p>We conclude with a chilling vision of the future from the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. It is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARTBL4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003ARTBL4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>New World Vistas of Air and Space Power for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Prior to the mid-21st century, there will be a virtual explosion of knowledge in the field of neuroscience. We will have achieved a clear understanding of how the human brain works, how it really controls the various functions of the body, and how it can be manipulated (both positively and negatively). One can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources, the output of which can be pulsed, shaped, and focused, that can couple with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscular movements, control emotions (and thus actions), produce sleep, transmit suggestions, interfere with both short-term and long-term memory, produce an experience set, and delete an experience set. This will open the door for the development of some novel capabilities that can be used in armed conflict, in terrorist/hostage situations, and in training…”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And based on the past clandestine abuses of MK-ULTRA reviewed above, one can predict with relative certainty that these capabilities will be used on civilians, with or without their knowledge or acquiescence, in the service of the New World Order.</p>

			<div class="date">
				<p>June 19, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17900#respond" title="Comment on The Illuminati Depopulation Agenda"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17900 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17900">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/25672aurahand.jpg" align="right" />While the global elite construct underground bunkers, eat organic and hoard seeds in Arctic vaults; the global poor are being slowly starved thanks to high commodity prices and poisoned with genetically modified (GMO) food. Austerity measures aimed largely at the poor are being imposed on all the nations of the world. Weather events grow more deadly and brushfire wars more frequent. An AK-47 can be obtained for $49 in the markets of West Africa. The depopulation campaign of the inbred <i>Illuminati</i>bankers is accelerating.</p>
<p><b>In 1957 President Dwight Eisenhower</b>, who later warned of a “military-industrial complex”, commissioned a panel of scientists to study the issue of overpopulation. The scientists put forth Alternatives I, II and III, advocating both the release of deadly viruses and perpetual warfare as means to decrease world population.</p>
<p>The first supposition dovetailed nicely with the pharmaceutical interests of the Rockefellers. According to Nexus magazine, the Rockefellers own one-half of the US pharmaceutical industry, which would reap billions developing medicines to “battle” the deadly viruses about to be released.</p>
<p><b>In 1969 the Senate Church Committee discovered that the US Defense Department</b> (DOD) had requested a budget of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars for a program to speed development of new viruses which target and destroy the human immune system. DOD officials testified before Congress that they planned to produce, “a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could be acquired… Most important is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.” House Bill 5090 authorized the funds and MK-NAOMI was carried out at Fort Detrick, Maryland.</p>
<p>Out of this research came the AIDS virus which was targeted at “undesirable elements” of the population. The first AIDS viruses were administered through a massive smallpox vaccine campaign in central and southern Africa by the World Health Organization in 1977. A year later ads appeared in major US newspapers soliciting “promiscuous gay male volunteers” to take part in a Hepatitis B vaccine study. [1]</p>
<p><b>The program targeted male homosexuals age 20-40 in New York City</b>, Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco. It was administered by the US Centers for Disease Control which, under its earlier incarnation as the US Public Health Department in Atlanta, oversaw the Tuskegee syphilis experiments on African American males. [2]</p>
<p>San Francisco has been a target of numerous CIA experiments, due to its high population of left-leaning and gay citizens, which the Illuminati views as “undesirables”. According to Dr. Eva Snead, San Francisco has one of the highest cancer rates in the country. For years, malathion – first developed by the Nazis – was sprayed over the city by helicopters from the CIA’s Evergreen Air, whose Arizona base is used, according to author William Cooper, as CIA transshipment point for Columbian cocaine. The mysterious Legionnaire’s Disease occurs often in San Francisco and the CIA’s MK-ULTRA mind control bad acid program was based there.</p>
<p><b>The intellectual force behind the introduction of AIDS</b> was the Bilderberger Group, which became fixated on population control after WWII. Author Cooper says the Policy Committee of the Bilderbergers gave orders to DOD to introduce the AIDS virus. The Bilderbergers are close to the Club of Rome, which was founded on a Rockefeller estate near Bellagio, Italy and is backed by the same European Black Nobility who frequent Bilderberger meetings. A 1968 study by the Club of Rome advocated lowering the birth rate and increasing the death rate. Club founder Dr. Aurelio Peccei made a top-secret recommendation to introduce a microbe that would attack the auto-immune system, then develop a vaccine as a prophylactic for the global elite. [3]</p>
<p>One month after the 1968 Club of Rome meeting Paul Ehrlich published <i>The Population Bomb</i>. The book hints at a draconian depopulation plan in the works. On page seventeen Ehrlich writes, “The problem could have been avoided by population control…so that a ‘death rate solution’ did not have to occur.” A year later MK-NAOMI was born. Peccei himself authored the Club of Rome’s much-touted <i>Global 2000</i> report, which President Jimmy Carter pushed on his BCCI shakedown cruise of Africa. Peccei wrote in the report, “Man is now vested with unprecedented, tremendous responsibilities and thrown into the role of moderator of life on the planet- including his own”.</p>
<p>The Bilderbergers were behind the Haig-Kissinger Depopulation Policy, a driving force at the State Department and administered by the National Security Council. Pressure is applied to Third World countries to reduce their populations. Those that do not comply see their US aid withheld or are subject to Pink Plan low-intensity war that targets civilians, especially women of child-bearing age. In Africa famine and brush-fire wars are encouraged. AK-47 rifles can be bought at West African markets for under $50. The same is true in the markets of Peshawar, Pakistan. In 1975, a year after attending a Club of Rome conference on the topic, Secretary of State Kissinger founded the Office of Population Affairs (OPA).</p>
<blockquote><p>DOD officials testified before Congress that they planned to produce, “a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could be acquired… Most important is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Latin American OPA case officer Thomas Ferguson spilled the beans on OPA’s agenda when he stated, “There is a single theme behind all our work; we must reduce population levels. Either they do it our way, through nice clean methods or they will get the kind of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran, or in Beirut…Once population is out of control it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it…The professionals aren’t interested in reducing population for humanitarian reasons…Civil wars are somewhat drawn-out ways to reduce population. The quickest way to reduce population is through famine like in Africa. We go into a country and say, here is your goddamn development plan. Throw it out the window. Start looking at your population…if you don’t …then you’ll have an El Salvador or an Iran, or worse, a Cambodia”. [4]</p>
<p><b>Ferguson said of El Salvador, “To accomplish what the State Department </b>deems adequate population control, the civil war (run by CIA) would have to be greatly expanded. You have to pull all the males into fighting and kill significant numbers of fertile, child-bearing age females. You are killing a small number of males and not enough fertile females to do the job…If the war went on 30-40 years, you might accomplish something. Unfortunately, we don’t have too many instances of this to study”.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Report from Iron Mountain</b></span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/25672pyramidstone.jpg" align="left" /><b>In 1961 Kennedy Administration officials McGeorge Bundy</b>, Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk, all CFR and Bilderberger members, led a study group which looked into “the problem of peace”. The group met at Iron Mountain, a huge underground corporate nuclear shelter near Hudson, New York, where CFR think tank The Hudson Institute is located. The bunker contains redundant offices in case of nuclear attack for Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and JP Morgan Chase. [5] A copy of the group discussions, known as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=iron%20mountain%20secret%20government&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Report_from_Iron_Mountain&amp;ei=5kq_UfCKFfKgyAH1sIFw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh7GQLQc2tW_eLgekLqZScSUyBEg" target="_blank">Report from Iron Mountain</a>, was leaked by a participant and published in 1967 by Dial Press.</p>
<p>The report’s authors saw war as necessary and desirable stating “War itself is the basic social system, within which other secondary modes of social organization conflict or conspire. (War is) the principal organizing force…the essential economic stabilizer of modern societies.” The group worried that through “ambiguous leadership” the “ruling administrative class” might lose its ability to “rationalize a desired war”, leading to the “actual disestablishment of military institutions”.</p>
<p><b>The report goes on to say, “…the war system cannot responsibly</b> be allowed to disappear until…we know exactly what we plan to put in its place…The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power…The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in its war powers. War has served as the last great safeguard against the elimination of necessary classes.”</p>
<p>Historian Howard Zinn described this conundrum when he wrote, “American capitalism needed international rivalry- and periodic war- to create an artificial community of interest between rich and poor, supplanting the genuine community of interest among the poor that showed itself in sporadic movements”.</p>
<p><b>The Iron Mountain gang was not the first to discover the virtues of war.</b> In 1909 the trustees of the Andrew Carnegie Foundation for International Peace met to discuss pre-WWI American life. Many of the participants were members of Skull &amp; Bones. They concluded, “There are no known means more efficient than war, assuming the objective is altering the life of an entire people…How do we involve the United States in a war?”</p>
<p>The <em>Report from Iron Mountain</em> goes on to propose a proper role for those of the lower classes, crediting military institutions with providing “antisocial elements with an acceptable role in the social structure.  The younger and more dangerous of these hostile social groupings have been kept under control by the Selective Service System…A possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of society is the reintroduction, in some form consistent with modern technology and political process, of slavery…The development of a sophisticated form of slavery may be an absolute prerequisite for social control in a world at peace.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“…the war system cannot responsibly be allowed to disappear until… we know exactly what we plan to put in its place… The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power… The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in its war powers.

<p><strong>The Iron Mountain goons, though thrilled by the idea of slavery, listed</strong> as other socioeconomic substitutions for war: a comprehensive social welfare program, a giant open-ended space program aimed at unreachable targets, a permanent arms inspection regime, an omnipresent global police and peacekeeping force, massive global environmental pollution which would require a large labor pool to clean up, socially-oriented blood sports and a comprehensive eugenics program. [6]</p>
<p>The Iraqi genocide fulfilled the dreams of the Club of Rome Zero Population Growth maniacs, while also providing a testing ground for two of the war substitutes proposed by the Iron Mountain fascists: an arms inspection regime and UN peacekeepers.  Both concepts gained traction in the international community thanks to the Gulf War.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Let the Iraqi Genocide Begin</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estimates of Iraqi casualties during the Gulf War are sobering</strong>.  Some organizations like Greenpeace put the death toll at near one million people.  It was a war in which the media was denied access on a scale never before seen, so casualty figures vary greatly.  According to Tony Murphy, a researcher at the International War Crimes Tribunal, the US attack on Iraq killed 125,000 civilians, while destroying 676 schools, 38 hospitals, 8 major hydroelectric dams, 11 power plants, 119 power substations and half the country’s telephone lines.  The attacks occurred mostly at night when people were most vulnerable.</p>
<p>In the months following the war the death rate of Iraqi children under five tripled.  Thirty-eight percent of these deaths were caused by diarrhea. [7]  Victor Filatov, a Russian journalist reporting for <em>Sovetskaya Rossiya</em> from post-war Baghdad wrote, “What further bloodshed do these barbarians of the 20th century need?  I thought the Americans had changed since Vietnam…but no, they never change.  They remain true to themselves.”</p>
<p><strong>According to former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the US was found guilty</strong> of nineteen war crimes against Iraq before the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=international%20war%20crimes%20tribunal&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FInternational_Criminal_Court&amp;ei=v1q_Uf6xBKqQyQGgsIBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrcA416NJD3FzUxz-76qj-liCvtg&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.aWc" target="_blank">International War Crimes Tribunal</a>.  The US dropped 88,000 tons of bombs on Iraq during the Gulf War and has rained down countless more bombs since.  Many bombs were tipped with armor piercing depleted uranium (DU) warheads, which may account for chronic Iraqi health problems.  Dr. Siegwart-Horst Gunther, a German physician who came to Iraq to help its people, became gravely ill when he handled just one cigar-sized fragment from a DU warhead.  Dr. Gunther measured the tiny object’s radioactivity to be 11 microSv per hour, whereas an acceptable exposure is no more than 300 microSv per year. [8]  Three hundred tons of DU ammunition was deployed during the war.</p>
<p>Many believe DU is responsible for Gulf War Syndrome, which has killed and permanently injured many US soldiers who fought in the Persian Gulf theater.  Since 2000, nearly 11,000 US Gulf War veterans have died from Gulf War Syndrome, while the Pentagon continues to cover up this travesty.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Satanism &amp; Psychotronic Warfare</strong></p>
<p><strong>The US also tested numerous top-secret high-tech weapons</strong> <strong>systems</strong> in the Gulf theatre, while utilizing some old low-frequency favorites.  When Iraqi ground forces surrendered, many of them were in a state of delirium and lethargy that could have been induced by extremely low-frequency radio waves, which the US used as a weapon as early as the Vietnam conflict.</p>
<p>Yale University and CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jose Delgado studied mind control for the Company <img alt="" src="http://loveforlife.com.au/files/2neumy3.jpg" width="268" height="201" data-lazy-type="image" data-lazy-src="http://loveforlife.com.au/files/2neumy3.jpg" />during the 1950’s as part of the MK-ULTRA program.  Delgado determined, “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even possible to create and follow intentions…By electronic stimulation of specific cerebral structures, movements can be induced by radio command…by remote control.”</p>
<p><strong>According to a military document written by Colonel Paul Valley</strong> and Major Michael Aquino titled <em>From PSYOP to Mindwar: The Psychology of Victory</em>, the US Army used an operational weapons system “to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with US national interests”.  The technique was used to secure the surrender of 29,276 armed Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army soldiers in 1967 and 1968.  The US Navy was also heavily involved in “psychotronic” research. [9]  Many US soldiers who served near the DMZ that divided North and South Vietnam claimed to see UFOs on a regular basis.  <em>The Pentagon Papers</em> revealed that an electronic barrier was placed along the DMZ by the secretive <a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=1142" target="_blank">JASON Society</a>.</p>
<p>Major Michael Aquino was an Army psyops specialist in Vietnam, where his unit specialized in drug-inducement, brainwashing, virus injection, brain implants, hypnosis, and use of electromagnetic fields and extremely low-frequency radio waves.  After Vietnam, Aquino moved to San Francisco and founded the Temple of Set.  Set is the ancient Egyptian name for Lucifer.  Aquino was now a senior US Military Intelligence official. [10]  He’d been given a Top Secret security clearance on June, 9, 1981.  Less than a month later an Army intelligence memo revealed that Aquino’s Temple of Set was an off-shoot of Anton La Vey’s Church of Satan, also headquartered in San Francisco. Two other Set members were Willie Browning and Dennis Mann.  Both were Army Intelligence officers.</p>
<p><strong>The Temple of Set was obsessed with military matters and political fascism</strong>.  It was especially preoccupied with the Nazi Order of the Trapezoid.  Aquino’s “official” job was history professor at Golden Gate College.  The Temple recruited the same Hells Angels who Billy Mellon Hitchcock had used to dole out his bad CIA acid.  Its members frequented prostitutes where they engaged in all manner of sadomasochistic activities. [11]  Director of Army Counter-Intelligence Donald Press revealed that Dennis Mann was assigned to the 306 PSYOPS Battalion and that Aquino was assigned to a top secret program known as Presidio.</p>
<p>Presidio is also the name of a spooky complex in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which Mikhail Gorbachev reportedly frequented as the Soviet Union was falling apart.  Was Aquino part of an operation to “map the mind” of the Soviet Union’s last leader and induce him into proposing both <em>glasnost</em> and <em>perestroika</em>, the two free market policies that ultimately led to the Soviet Union’s demise?  Remember the curious mark which suddenly appeared on Gorbachev’s forehead?  Was he implanted with some sort of microchip mind-control device to make him think “in accordance with US national interests”?</p>
<p><strong>Such Orwellian technology is marketed on a regular basis throughout the world</strong>.  International Healthline Corporation and others sell microchip implants in the US, Russia and Europe.  The Humane Society has adopted a policy of micro-chipping all stray pets. The State of Hawaii <em>requires</em> that all pets be micro-chipped.  Six thousand people in Sweden have accepted a microchip in their hand, which they use for all purchases. Trials are also underway in Japan.  In July 2002, National Public Radio reported a similar trial beginning in Seattle.  Later in 2002, after a rash of suspicious abductions of young girls, BBC reported that a British company plans to implant children with microchips so that their parents can monitor their whereabouts.</p>
<p>Dr. Carl Sanders, a highly acclaimed electronics engineer, revealed that a microchip project he launched to help people with severed spinal cords was taken over by Bill Colby’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=bill%20colby%20%2B%20operation%20phoenix%20&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhoenix_Program&amp;ei=OFu_UefeCKqgyAG6goGYCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0OWTTqoG1_WcdtidXIwaGL9YXNQ&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.aWc" target="_blank">Operation Phoenix </a>in a series of meetings organized by Henry Kissinger.  Sanders says the optimal spot for a microchip implant is just below the hairline on a person’s forehead, since the device can be recharged by changes in body temperatures, which are most pronounced there.  Interestingly, this is the location of the pineal gland or Third Eye.</p>
<p><strong>The 1986 Emigration Control Act grants the President the power to mandate</strong> any kind of ID he deems necessary. [12]  Researchers at Southern California have developed a chip which mimics the hippocampus, the part of the brain that deals with memory.  Pentagon officials are interested in using it in experiments to create a “super-soldier”. [13]  Another microchip called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrainGate" target="_blank">Brain Gate</a> is being implanted in paralyzed people.  It allows them to control their environment by simply thinking. [14]</p>
<p>In Iraq, psychological warfare gave way to slow genocide.  According to UNICEF, as of late 2001, 1.5 million Iraqi children had died as a result of sanctions, while one child in ten died before their first birthday.  Thalassemia, anemia and diarrhea were the biggest killers and could have been prevented were it not for a chronic shortage of blood and medicine in Iraq due to the sanctions.  UN Committee 661 served as arbiter of what constituted a “dual use” item and therefore banned for import into Iraq.  As of 2001, over 1,600 Iraqi contracts with Western companies for medical equipment had been blocked by 661. [15]</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Yale University and CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jose Delgado studied mind control for the Company during the 1950’s as part of the MK-ULTRA program.  Delgado determined, “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even possible to create and follow intentions…By electronic stimulation of specific cerebral structures, movements can be induced by radio command…by remote control.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Gulf War decimated Iraq’s sewer and water treatment systems</strong>.  Iraqis were forced to drink polluted water, leading to numerous health problems.  Iraq was not allowed to import chlorine to clean the water since 661 deemed it a potential chemical weapon.  Electrical power was rationed in three-hour daily increments per household since the Iraqi government couldn’t get the parts it needed to fix its power plants after the US bombed its entire power grid.  With the devaluation of the Iraqi <em>dinar</em> and the ban on the export of 2.4 million barrels of oil per day, the average Iraqi lived on $2.50 a month- enough to buy a pair of shoes.  The only Iraqis not affected were the wealthy elite, who had long ago stashed their savings overseas in US dollars.</p>
<p>UNICEF estimates that 28% of Iraqi children no longer went to school.  Before the war almost all children attended.  Often families could only afford to send one child to school because of the cost of simple things like backpacks, shoes and notebooks.  Rafah Salam Aziz, Director of Mansour Children’s Hospital, said parents were often forced to make similar decisions about their children’s lives.  Aziz said, “Many times it’s easier for a family to let a baby die rather than let the whole family go hungry and get sick.”[16]</p>
<p><strong>In 1996 Clinton Defense Secretary William Perry announced a new military buildup</strong> in the Persian Gulf.  Soon cruise missiles were again raining down on Baghdad.  Many nations now grew weary of both US bombing and the sanctions regime, which was brutalizing the Iraqi people while strengthening the grip of Saddam Hussein.  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose country signed a deal with Iraq to rebuild its shattered oil sector, said he was disturbed at the use of “extreme and radical force against the Arab world”.  The Russian opposition offered a more scalding appraisal.  Alexander Lebed stating angrily, “The US is like a strong master who spits on everybody.”[17]</p>
<p>Turkey, Jordan and Syria all expressed unease over the new round of bombing.  Even the Saudis, where Islamic fundamentalism was on the rise and two major bombings had occurred at US bases, now refused to allow the US to use its bases to bomb Iraq.  Many countries, including France, began openly flaunting the UN embargo against Iraq in the late 1990’s.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Halliday, former Assistant Secretary of the UN </strong>who initially headed the UN Humanitarian Program to Iraq, resigned his post in protest. He said sanctions were demolishing the very class of Iraqi people who wanted to create a better government in the country.  He was scornful of the UN Oil for Food Program under which the US received 70% of Iraqi oil.  Halliday stated plainly, “We are guilty of committing genocide, through the Security Council, against Iraq.”[18]</p>
<p>Halliday’s 1998 successor was Hans Van Sponeck, who watched as the UN unfurled the UNSCOM arms inspection regime, paid for by Iraqi oil sales.  US inspector Scott Ritter confirmed Iraqi suspicions that UNSCOM was gathering intelligence for CIA and Mossad.  UNSCOM was just the latest CIA tool.  In 1996 the Iraqi government claimed international relief agencies, including the World Food Program, which claimed to be helping the Kurds, were actually CIA operatives attempting to destabilize the country.</p>
<p><strong>In fact the CIA had spent more than $20 million in its support of the Iraqi National Congress</strong>, led by long-time CIA surrogate Jalal Talibani’s PKK Kurdish faction. [19]  In January 1997 Iraq uncovered two Mossad spy rings in one month following the attempted assassination of Saddam Hussein’s son. [20]  Hans Van Sponeck had seen enough. He too resigned in protest.</p>
<p>In early 1999 it was revealed that the US had used UNSCOM to plant electronic bugging devices in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  Arms inspector Scott Ritter said the CIA was using UNSCOM to “provoke a crisis”.  In December 1998 UNSCOM, faced with the embarrassing accusations of espionage, pulled out of Iraq.  On December 15th the US launched a new round of bombing.  Ritter says intelligence gathered by UNSCOM was used for targeting. UNSCOM spokesman David Kay resurfaced in 2003 calling for a US invasion of Iraq. He now worked for SAIC, which landed numerous Pentagon contracts to rebuild Iraq.</p>

<p>The debate over what actions actually constitute “terrorism,” I believe, will become one of the defining ideological battles of our era. Terrorism is not a word often used by common people to describe aberrant behaviors or dastardly deeds; however, it <em>is</em> used by governments around the world to label and marginalize political enemies. That is to say, it is the government that normally decides who is a “terrorist” and who is a mere “criminal,” the assertion being that one is clearly far worse than the other.</p>
<p>The terrorist label elicits emotional firestorms and fearful brain-quakes in the minds of the masses. It causes the ignorant and unaware to abandon principles they would normally apply to any other malicious enterprise. They begin to reason that a criminal should be afforded justice, while a terrorist should be afforded only vengeance, even though the act of branding a person a “terrorist” is often completely arbitrary. This vengeance is usually pursued by any means. Thus, the terrorist moniker becomes a rationalization for every vicious and inhuman policy of the establishment, as well as for the citizenry.</p>
<p>Dishonorable and foolish people claim the existence of terrorism essentially gives license for the rest of us to become criminal, willfully trampling on individuals’ rights to privacy, property, free speech, due process, civic participation, etc. Mass criminality against the individual in the name of social safety is the glue that holds together all tyrannical systems, triggering a catastrophic cycle of moral relativism that eventually bleeds a culture dry.</p>
<p>Historically, the expanded use of the terrorist label by governments tends to coincide with the rising tides of despotism. A government that quietly seeks to dominate the people will inevitably begin to treat the people as if they are the enemy. Those citizens who present the greatest philosophical or physical threat to the centralization of power are usually the first to suffer. I do not think it is unfair to say that any system of authority that suddenly claims to see terrorists under every rock and behind every tree is probably about to rain full-on fascism down upon the population.</p>
<p>The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is the legal extension of this process, with a vaporous gray language that allows the government to interpret it in any manner it deems useful, which conveniently allows it to interpret a wide range of “offenses” as acts of war against the state.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s “If You See Something Say Something” campaign is the social extension of the process, by which it creates the framework for a paranoid self-censored surveillance culture.</p>
<p>The fusion center network is the enforcement extension designed to surround local and State police with an atmosphere of indoctrination and federalized dogma, teaching common cops to profile according to a template that is so ambiguous that literally any activity could be considered suspicious or terroristic.</p>
<p>All that is left for the establishment is to force the vocabulary of fear into mainstream consciousness. This means constant propaganda. This means furious hype. This means an utterly shameless barrage of false associations, misdirections and fantastical fairyland lies. This means that we have reached a point in the grand totalitarian scheme in which the American populace is about to be bombarded with an endless drone of terrorism brainwashing — not demonizing a foreign enemy, but demonizing the hypothetical extremist next door. In fact, the Boston Marathon bombing seems to have been the signal for an escalation of such rhetoric. The high-speed conditioning has already begun.</p>
<p>In Middlefield, Ohio, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/watch-ohio-driver-killed-gun-battle-cops-article-1.1335608" target="_blank">James Gilkerson</a>, an unemployed man taking care of his elderly mother, was pulled over during a routine traffic stop only to exit his vehicle firing an AK-47 at police officers. The action was obviously unprovoked; the police responded with deadly force, and rightly so. I would have done the same. Gilkerson’s attack was crazy, yes. Criminal? Yes. But Middlefield Police Chief Arnold Stanko’s remarks to the press bring a whole other dark side to this already tragic event. Stanko stated that: “He got out of the vehicle, intending to kill my officers. We don’t know why he did it… He was a scumbag and a terrorist, and he’s dead.”</p>
<p>Stanko doesn’t know why Gilkerson fired at police, but he is certain that the man was a “terrorist.” What if Gilkerson was depressed or overmedicated or he just snapped that day? Terrorism denotes certain premeditation and planning. This attack was clearly not part of a malicious scheme, yet the label of “terrorist” is being thrown around nonchalantly, almost as if law enforcement has been trained to use such rhetoric whenever it suits them.</p>
<p>In Montevideo, Minn., the FBI recently raided the home of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/06/us-usa-crime-minnesota-idUSBRE9450KJ20130506" target="_blank">Buford Rogers</a>, who was convicted of felony burglary in 2011. Authorities had received reports that Buford was in possession of a firearm, which is illegal for convicted felons. The raid did indeed produce firearms, as well as items the FBI dubbed “explosive devices.” They did not specify what these “explosive devices” were or if they actually posed a significant threat to anyone. After the bust, headlines read “FBI Thwarts Terror Attack.”</p>
<p>Again, there is absolutely no indication here of a planned attack. There’s no indication that Rogers had any intent to hurt anyone or even any ideological motivations to hurt anyone. Yet the terrorism label is used again to describe a routine criminal arrest.</p>
<p>In Tempe, Ariz., 18-year-old <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/09/joshua-prater-ied_n_3245735.html" target="_blank">Joshua Prater</a> was arrested after a maid found an “explosive device” in his closet and turned it in to authorities. Prater claims he built the device, consisting of a carbon dioxide cartridge, a fireworks fuse, gunpowder, match heads and fireworks, eight years ago; and he claims he was not aware it was dangerous. Police did not call Prater a terrorist, but they did refer to his device as an “IED,” which, as we all know, is the abbreviation used by U.S. soldiers to describe an “improvised explosive device,” the favorite weapon of insurgents and “terrorists” in Iraq and Afghanistan. Such terminology is <em>not</em> coincidental. Make no mistake; this is a calculated effort to introduce the language of the battlefield to the streets of America.</p>
<p>Seattle police are now holding simulation drills of attacks on local schools in which law enforcement officials fight against gun-wielding proxy opponents posing as “angry parents.”</p>
<p><iframe width="590" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2xsPaFjslZM?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>These kinds of drills are a part of a larger DHS program implemented through fusion centers which, in my view, is designed to desensitize law enforcement to violence against common citizens. Said drills have simulated conflicts with constitutionalists, home-schoolers, patriots and so on. Let’s be clear here; the “terrorists” that the police are now being trained to fight against are people like you and me. We are being painted as the future enemy.</p>
<p>Just to solidify this reality, I will also point out the recent exposure of a DHS training program series available on the Federal Emergency Management Agency Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program website, which includes a media section designed to provide teaching aids to agency heads and law enforcement. The series includes a fabricated news broadcast that covers a hypothetical raid on a “militia headquarters.” The video shows semi-automatic firearms, rifle scopes, night vision, flak jackets — all perfectly legal in the United States today — as illegal “contraband,” while painting gun owners and militias as chemical weapon-wielding terrorists.</p>
<p><iframe width="590" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bn5Qh9QLCnA?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>What started as an appeal to the average American’s sense of Islamophobia after the 9/11 attacks has now evolved into the full-spectrum theater of random domestic terrorism that culminates in what the establishment calls “self-radicalization.”</p>
<p>The concept of self-radicalization is a very interesting propaganda tactic. Rather than limiting the public’s fear only to some outside foreign enemy like Al Qaeda or some domestic activist organization like the liberty movement, the establishment has now composed a narrative in which each and every one of us might one day catch the extremist virus of dissent, defiance or ideological violence and suddenly decide to kill, kill, kill.</p>
<p>The more naïve subsections of our society will accept unConstitutional methods against the “radicalized” out of fear and conditioning, without realizing that the machinations of bureaucracy being used against those they hate could just as easily be used against them in the future.</p>
<p>If the elites achieve the social endgame they desire, legal and political wordplay will become so broad that anyone could be targeted. If you are a citizen who defies the establishment power structure, then you are an extremist. If you are an extremist, then you are a terrorist. If you are a terrorist, then you are an enemy combatant. And, under the NDAA, if you are an enemy combatant, you are no longer a citizen and you no longer deserve Constitutional protection. The circular logic is maddening, not to mention outrageous. But it is also very useful when an abusive government needs a pretext to silence or destroy dissent. Under totalitarianism, all people become terrorists. It starts with the mistreatment of the worst of us, and it ends with the mistreatment of the best of us.</p>

			<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.” </i>  Proverbs 16:18</p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fallofmankind3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fallofmankind2.jpg" align="left" /></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In “<i>Against the Heathen</i>,” early Church Father Athanasius reveals that pride and haughtiness preceded man’s fall into idolatry and paganism.  A haughty spirit led them to make light of higher things, and deliberately disregarding what they knew to be true they began to seek in preference things in the lower or natural dimension.  Thus they fell into worship of self, sexual pleasures and acquisition of status and things to the living God and higher things.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The truth as to evil said Athanasius,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> <i>“….is that it originates, and resides, in the perverted choice of the darkened soul</i>” which, “<i>materialized by forgetting God”</i> and engrossed in lower things<i>, “makes them into gods</i>,” and thereby  <i>“descends into a hopeless depth of delusion and superstition,</i>” whereby <i>”they ceased to think that anything existed beyond what is seen, or that anything was good save things temporal and bodily; so turning away and forgetting that she was in the image of the good God, she no longer… sees God the Word after whose likeness she is made; but having departed from herself, imagines and feigns what is not (and then) advancing further in evil, they came to celebrate as gods the elements and the principles of which bodies are composed</i>….” (Against the Heathen, New Advent)  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Having descended into delusion and superstition they imagined they had no free will and further that “all that exists” is the natural dimension&#8212; a divine One Substance, watery abyss, chaos, or void, primordial matter, animated natural powers, forces, and deterministic laws, all of which they celebrated and attributed miraculous powers to.   So for example, with the Egyptians’ self-created Sun-God Ra, the divine abyss or One Substance out of which he evolved is Nu&#8211;primordial matter:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“I came into being from primordial matter…I made all the forms under which I appeared by means of</i> (or out of<i>) the god-soul which I raised up out of Nu</i> (i.e., the primeval abyss of water.) (The Long War Against God, Dr. Henry Morris, p. 243)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This is naturalism, or materialism, which is the belief that there is neither living God nor heavenly realm.  There is only the natural dimension, thus evolutionary materialist Dr. Scott Todd wrote in the science journal ‘Nature:’</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“<i>Even if all the data point to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic.”</i>  (Naturalism in the Light of Reality, Robert Gurney, creation.com, June 14, 2012) </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Materialism is of the worldview of monism which is held in common by pantheism and spiritualism and dates back to pagan antiquity and was or is taught by all non-biblical thought systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Greek Stoics and Epicureans, for example, were materialistic monists and these two schools of natural science and evolution held the ancient world of thought in allegiance well into the Roman Empire.  Epicureanism reigns supreme in our own age through modern evolutionary materialism, which is merely revamped and revised Epicureanism.   </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The pagan philosopher Epicurus (342-270 B.C.) believed in an infinite number of worlds, or parallel universes in the words of contemporary ‘new’ pagan materialists.  Like his modern counterparts, Epicurus taught that there was no god or gods, first principles, moral law, souls and afterlife as all things on earth had evolved from the earth material.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Epicurus preferred lower things to higher things, as do his contemporary followers, thus he taught that “all that exists” is an eternally existing void and animated matter.  This made human beings, their intelligence and volition, an evolved accident of chance.    Reason is left, but reason is active only because sensations (i.e., firing of neurons, chemical interactions) stimulate it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In modern “scientific” terms, the idea that brute matter spontaneously generated itself from nothing (void) in much the same way as Ra spontaneously generated himself from Nu is called abiogenesis.  On the basis of this ancient mythological superstition, new-pagan evolutionary materialists assert that the living supernatural God, souls, spirits, angels, demons, heaven, hell and metaphysics do not exist.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">As for ‘modern’ evolutionary theory, anthropologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, longtime director of the American Museum of Natural History reveals that Darwin is not its’ originator but rather ancient pagans are.  In the introduction to his history of evolutionism Osborn wrote:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“<i>When I began the search for anticipations of the evolutionary theory….I was led back to the Greek natural philosophers and I was astonished to find how many of the pronounced and basic features of the Darwinian theory were anticipated even as far back as the seventh century B.C</i>.” (Osborn, From the Greeks to Darwin, p. xi)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Abiogenesis is such an obvious embarrassment that today some naturalists such as SETI researcher Paul Davies and Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the DNA molecule, have abandoned it in favor of panspermia.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Panspermia is the idea that life on earth was accidentally seeded by meteorites containing the essential building blocks of life or perhaps by highly evolved extraterrestrials who for billions of years have been guiding the evolution of man.   The extraterrestrial idea was favored by Arthur C. Clarke in his book, “<i>Childhood’s End</i>” and a variation on this theme has recently been advanced by Davies, Crick, and Ralph Pudritz of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Davies has written seriously about the possibility of “<i>alien bioengineering</i>” that could be detected in the DNA of life on earth and suggests that citizen scientists and school students be enlisted to help search for evidence. (An Alien Code Close to Home: Seeking ET Beyond the Radio Silence, Astrobiology Magazine, Jeremy Hsu, 10/27/2011)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Pudritz theorizes that humans and aliens may share the same DNA which itself could be part of a universal structure “<i>of the first genetic codes anywhere</i>….” (Why Aliens Might Look Like You, Eddie Wren, dailymail.co.uk/ June 11, 2012)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Crick proposes a theory called “directed panspermia,” the idea that,</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">He admits however that his theory only pushes the unresolvable problem of the origin of life out into deep space:</span></span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Myth of Extraterrestrials</span></span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In his book, “<i>Scientific Mythologies</i>,” James A. Herrick traces the ‘aliens from outer-space’ idea back to certain Renaissance astrologers, occultists, and mystics such as Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) who claimed to not only receive telepathic secrets from spirits but to have visited populated planets during out-of-body experiences. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Swedenborg’s influence is far-reaching.  From Kant to the occult theosophist Madame Blavatsky and points in between and on into our own time to psychologist J.B. Rhine, a vast array of science fiction writers (i.e., Clarke, H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, Steven Spielberg) and numerous evolutionary scientists.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Over time, Swedenborg’s astral plane ‘space travels’ gave birth to what Herrick dubs “<i>The Myth of the Extraterrestrial.</i>”  As far back as the seventeenth century science fiction writers were imagining “<i>the intelligent extraterrestrial visitor</i>” and preparing the public to accept their existence.   And accept them they have, for the twentieth century has witnessed a veritable population explosion in the alien domain, said Herrick.  (p. 43)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In general, science fiction, like new-pagan evolutionary materialism, is neither particularly scientific nor futuristic.  It is rather a regression to the mystical pagan origins of modern science that reappeared in the heart of Christendom during the Renaissance.   In “<i>The Abolition of Man</i>” (1974) C.S. Lewis points out that the Renaissance reawakened a magical view of the world closely connected with pagan Gnostic sectarianism, Hermetic magic, astrology, Eastern pantheism and alchemical scientism .   Accompanying all of this was evolution, occultism, Epicureanism, reincarnation and karma.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Evolution is both the antithesis of creation ex nihilo and the primary doctrine of both Eastern pantheism and Western scientific materialism, and so early on Lewis understood that both movements were merely two sides of the same pagan revival.  Thus he argued that pantheism and materialism are not enemies in principle but rather cooperating philosophies united against the supernatural Creator, His Revelation, creation ex nihilo, all higher things, the linear view of history and Christian-based civilization.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">What this means is that naturalism, abiogenesis, chance, natural selection, multiple universe and panspermia theories are but six contemporary adaptations of ancient pagan “idolatry, magic, occult mysticism and mythology.”   These six are of a whole host of fallacies derived from modern evolutionary thinking that have permeated the post-Christian West and American society giving birth to a “new” pagan religion of evolutionary science.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Fall of Western Civilization</span></span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Christendom and Protestant America arose on the wings of the Genesis account of creation ex nihilo, the Biblical view of man’s sinful condition and God’s Moral Law.   Their subsequent fall was traced b</span>y Richard Weaver in his book, “<i>Ideas Have Consequences</i>,” (1945).   In many ways Weaver’s analysis parallels Athanasius’ account of the fall of man.  </p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Weaver writes that 14<sup>th</sup> century Western man had made an <i>&#8220;evil decision</i>” to abandon his belief in the transcendent God and universals and thus the position that &#8220;<i>there is a source of truth higher than, and independent of, man&#8230;&#8221; </i> The consequences of the rejection of “higher things” were catastrophic:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&#8220;<i>The denial of everything transcending experience means inevitably&#8230;the denial of truth. With the denial of objective truth there is no escape from the relativism of &#8216;man is the measure of all things.&#8221;</i> (The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America, George H. Nash, pp. 32-33)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><b>“Now the soul of mankind, not satisfied with the devising of evil, began by degrees to venture upon what is worse still.”</b>   Athanasius</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Fueled by a corrupted motive of dominating and bull-dozing the real world so as to coerce other wills, Western apostates conceptually murdered the living God, sealed off the supernatural dimension and elevated Nature to the supreme reality.  The doctrine of original sin was abandoned and replaced by the “goodness of man.”  With only the material realm of the senses held to be real, supernatural Christianity declined, the omniscient mind of human-gods arose, and pagan materialistic science became the most prestigious way to study man.  With knowledge limited to the sensory realm, man’s spiritual attributes&#8212;-soul, mind, conscience and volition&#8212;were soon lost in an endless cycle of reductionism and determinism.  Man, created in the spiritual likeness of his supernatural Creator was lost.  In his place stood the soulless human ape, an accidental emergent product of evolution and “earth material.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> <b>Fall of Western Man</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From the Renaissance to our own time, a stunning spiritual transformation of consciousness has shifted Western and American thinking away from the supernatural God and biblical religion and toward the lower thing, the new pagan religion of evolution.    In his book, “<i>The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Tradition</i>,” James Herrick calls it the “<i>New Religious Synthesis</i>” and briefly outlines seven of its components:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">1. History (as well as unchanging truth and moral absolutes) has no spiritual significance.  This is because the idea of continuous evolutionary change makes them absurd.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">2. The supremacy of omniscient reason, mystical mind-powers, intuition, and collective consciousness.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">3. The spiritualization of science. Since the empirical study of the material universe employs reason to acquire knowledge, and reason is not physical but rather spiritual, today it is acknowledged that reason is in fact acquiring spiritual knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">4. Animated nature (animism).   The natural dimension is alive with energies, divine spirit, Zoe, god-soul, and consciousness. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">5. Gnosis, or esoteric knowledge, the provenance of spiritual elites and extraordinarily gifted individuals, including some scientists.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">6. Spiritual evolution.  Through control and direction of their own spiritual evolution certain naturally selected humans are destined to realize unimaginable spiritual advances. Spiritual or conscious evolution leap frogs off of Darwin’s’ biological theory and will supposedly lead to actual human divinity.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">7. Religious syncretism rooted in common mystical experiences and telepathic revelations from disembodied intelligences. (Herrick, pp. 33-35)</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“But in his estate shall (Antichrist) honour the God of forces.” Dan. 11:38</span></span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Under the New Religious Synthesis, the animated <i>god-force called evolution</i> is the principle miracle-producing power of the cosmos. Whether by way of abiogenesis or by accidental or directed panspermia, human beings are evolution’s conscious products and can now achieve ever-higher levels of consciousness by directing their own evolution.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In the book, “<i>The Aquarian Conspiracy</i>,” Marilyn Ferguson pointed out that the efficient direction of evolution requires “<i>a mechanism for biological change more powerful than chance mutation</i>” which will open “<i>the possibility of rapid evolution in our time</i>.” (p. 148)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Some evolutionists now claim that this powerful mechanism is presently available to man from aliens who will solve mankind’s problems and conduct man to a new “cosmic” age. Aliens are busily transforming the consciousness of abductees and other Westerners and through them teaching evolution, naturalism  and occult New Age philosophy as well as warning of a coming planetary apocalypse and denying the living God, the supernatural dimension and Christian theism. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">All of this has led French physicist and UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee to conclude that something is happening to human consciousness that is causing a major shift in man’s belief systems and his relationship to the concept of the invisible.  Vallee believes that the same “<i>powerful force’</i> that influenced the human race in the past is influencing it again:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“…..human belief…is being controlled and conditioned, man’s concepts are being rearranged, and we may be headed toward a massive change of human attitudes toward paranormal abilities and extraterrestrial life.”  (</i>Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future, Fr. Seraphim Rose, p. 109)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In light of this, Vallee proposes the hypothesis that there is a control system,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“… for human consciousness…I am suggesting that what takes place through close encounters with UFOs is control of human beliefs, control of the relationship between our consciousness and physical reality, and that this control has been in force throughout history….”</i> (Alien Intrusion: UFOs and the Evolution Connection, Gary Bates, p. 158)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Frank Baumer concurs and observes that evolution has,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“….<i>persuaded people to think of everything in nature as the fruit of a gradual growth rather than an original creation.”</i>   The sweeping acceptance of evolutionary thinking means that it is “<i>now difficult if not impossible for an educated man to conceive of a primitive revelation such as traditional Christianity taught, or even of an original natural religion from which men had declined</i>.” This difficulty arises because “<i>in an evolving world, perfection obviously lay, not in the past, but in the future.”</i>(Religion and Rise of Skepticism, p. 147)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In occult terminology, transformation of consciousness is egregore, a concept representing a “thought form” (i.e., Richard Dawkins’ memes) or “collective group mind,” resulting from a psychic entity influencing the thoughts of a group of people.   However, egregore derives from the Greek word for “watchers,” leading the French occult magician Eliphas Levi (1810-1875) to identify egregore with the fallen angel ‘fathers’ of the nephilim.   In Christian language, transformation of consciousness means “demonic outpouring.’ Vallee’s “powerful force” is a new demonic outpouring being loosed upon mankind.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">So complete has the transformation been that the <i>God of forces</i> has successfully inverted the order of creation and reversed the direction of Biblical theism.  With creation ex nihilo virtually replaced by evolution, it is now believed that men have not fallen from perfection but instead are gradually evolving upward from their ape beginnings toward greater and greater spiritual perfection.  Self-perfecting man no longer needs the living, supernatural God as the idea of “conscious evolution” means he can save himself, and perhaps even attain god-hood.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><b>“The gradual abasement of the Soul from Truth to Falsehood (is) by the abuse of her freedom of Choice</b>.”     Athanasius</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Two brilliant visionaries foresaw the stunning events we are witnessing today—the wholesale rejection of Truth tied to the fall of Westerners into idolatry and paganism influenced and directed by a demonic outpouring effecting a transformation of consciousness in tandem with the rise of the New Religious Synthesis.  Each man in his own way predicted these events would usher in the end of the world and the appearance of the Antichrist. The two visionaries, Vladimir Soloviev (1850-1900), a brilliant Russian philosopher and theologian, and Robert Hugh Benson (1871-1914), an English Catholic priest, recorded their predictions in gripping novels&#8212;Soloviev in the “<i>A Short Tale of the Antichrist</i>” and Benson in “<i>Lord of the World</i>.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Benson saw through the scientific pretenses of new-pagan materialism and its’ primary doctrine, evolutionary theory, leading him to describe it and its’ ideological movement Communism as “<i>quiet pantheism</i>.” </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Benson predicted that evolutionary thinking would prepare Westerners and Americans not only to embrace the ‘new’ pagan religion but to worship and adore Antichrist, for this human-god (Mr. Felsenburgh) is the first perfected product of nature and evolutionary forces. Mr. Felsenburgh has arisen in America and he is,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“….the first perfect product of that new cosmopolitan creation to which the world has labored throughout its history</i>…” (p 85)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">He transfixes men, and they excitedly declare they have seen, </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“…<i>the Son of Man,’ the ‘Savior of the world,’ we knew Him in our hearts as soon as we saw Him, as soon as He stood there. It was like a glory around his head</i> (and now we) <i>understand it all… It was He for whom we have waited so long; and He has come, bringing Peace and Goodwill in His hands.”</i> (pp. 85, 89)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Christianity failed, it divided people. But now Jehovah is gone.  He never existed at all except as a hideous nightmare. Now at long last man’s natural Savior has arisen:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">”<i>The reign of God has really begun</i> (and<i>) we are all partakers of God</i>” because God is in everything, including all men….”<i>Jehovah has fallen. He is in His grave.”</i>  In His place is the evolved Son of Man, a god indeed and a man as well…”<i>a god because human and a man because so divine</i>.” (ibid, pp. 93, 95)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Soloviev’s predictions regarding events in our age are astonishing in their prescience, primarily because they not only offer an amazingly accurate glimpse into the mind of the super-man who will become the Antichrist but they also illustrate the real obstacle to salvation, the refusal by proud, willful men to recognize and admit to their sinful condition. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Prior to his transformation, Soloviev describes the proud super- man as outwardly just, but within he is full of pride and is morally reprehensible:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“…. <i>He believes in God but loves nobody but himself. His relationship with Christ was quickly defined as one of superiority</i> (for he will never) <i>bow before Him like the most stupid of Christians</i> (nor<i>) mutter senselessly….’Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me’….’I, the bright genius, the superman! No, never</i>!” (The Wrath of God: The Days of Antichrist, Livio Fanzaga, pp. 39-40)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">As the super-mans’ spiritual fall progresses, instead of the former cold rational respect for the living God and Christ:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“…..<i>there was born and grew in his heart, first, a kind of terror, and then a burning, choking and corroding envy and furious breath-taking hatred</i>.”  Devoured with envy of Jesus Christ he cries out “<i>He rotted in the tomb, rotted like the lowest</i>…” (ibid, pp. 40-41)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This is the moment the Evil One has been waiting for.  He openly approaches the proud super-man and possesses him:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“<i>He saw those piercing eyes and heard&#8230;a strange voice, toneless…stifled, and yet clear, metallic and absolutely soulless as though coming from a phonograph.” Satan pours out his spirit, saying, “I ask nothing of you, and I will help you for your own sake…Receive my spirit…it gives birth to you in power. At these words…the superman’s lips opened of themselves, two piercing eyes came quite close to his face, and he felt a sharp, frozen stream enter into him and fill his whole being. And at the same time he was conscious of a wonderful strength, energy, lightness and rapture</i>.” (p. 43)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Soloviev masterfully portrays a striking contrast between the apostles of Christ and the Antichrist. The former receive the power of the living God and are full of wisdom, truth, and courage while the latter receives the power of the devil and is full of nihilistic pride, lies, burning envy, murderous hate, blasphemy, cursing, resentment, deception, covetousness, and perversion.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Antichrist, as described by Soloviev, suffers the same massively inflated pride and envy that transformed Lucifer into the devil. This same pride and envy animated the pantheist sorcerer Hegel, the neo-pagan Masonic Illuminati who planned and instigated the bloody French Revolution, as well as Karl Marx, Nietzsche, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, the West’s “God is dead” theologians, America’s Ruling Class, and many contemporary New World Order globalists. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  <b>The “New” Pagan Religion of Darkened Souls</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“….human history can now be hesitantly traced back as an unbroken narrative to 4000 B.C.  The facts must not, however, be twisted to suit the fallacy of necessary human progress.  For the picture emerging….is one of the Fall of Man in historic terms as well as his rise; it is a picture …more of degradation than of success; it is a picture of monotheism breaking down into polytheism and of the struggle to return to monotheism.  The establishment view of the history of religion gradually progressing from animism to polytheism, from polytheism to monotheism is the reverse of facts</i>.”  (The God-Kings and the Titans: The New World Ascendancy in Ancient Times, James Baily, 1973, p. 296)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Evolution is a religion, said Michael Ruse. From the beginning it was a religion and this is true of evolution today.  (Michael Ruse, former professor of philosophy and zoology at the University of Guelph, Canada, “How evolution became a religion: creationists correct?” National Post, pp. B1, B3, B7, May 13, 2000)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.  From the beginning this was true, and in these last days it is still true.  Pride, haughtiness and envy are the common bonds linking Satan, the Antichrist, idolatry, paganism, the Religion of Evolution and all who have been and are being spiritually transformed by it.   Thus when the Antichrist arrives, perhaps as a highly evolved extraterrestrial or as the Transcended Master Maitreya, all darkened souls will perversely celebrate him as the highly evolved god and man they foolishly believe they too will become.</span></span></span></p>

<p>In December 2012 the Prime Minster of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, caused a stir by speaking straight-faced to reporters about extraterrestrial beings.</p>
<p>In a candid moment after a televised interview, he made statements to a reporter that instantly got the attention of many.</p>
<p>ExoNews.org reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>After completing an on-air interview with five television reporters on December 7, 2012, Prime Minister Medvedev continued to respond to reporters and made some off-air comments without realizing that the microphone was still on. He was then asked by one reporter if “the president is handed secret files on aliens when he receives the briefcase needed to activate Russia’s nuclear arsenal,” Medvedev responded:</p>
<p><em>Along with the briefcase with nuclear codes, the president of the country is given a special ‘top secret’ folder. This folder in its entirety contains information about aliens who visited our planet… Along with this, you are given a report of the absolutely secret special service that exercises control over aliens on the territory of our country… More detailed information on this topic you can get from a well-known movie called Men In Black… I will not tell you how many of them are among us because it may cause panic.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>News reports treated the admission as a joke, especially with the assumed reference to the well known Hollywood ’Men in Black’ film. However many speculate at Medvedev’s frank, ’matter-of-fact’ attitude, and also that he called &#8220;Men in Black&#8221; a <i>documentary film</i>.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Men In Black&#8221; documentary is a well known film in Russia that details UFO cases:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the Russian Men In Black (MIB) documentary, a number of prominent UFO cases in Russia and the USA are discussed. The Roswell UFO crash is covered, along with a number of extraterrestrial abduction cases, and UFOs disabling nuclear weapons facilities. The documentary examines testimony that extraterrestrial bases have been established on Earth, and that some are in restricted US military areas with the full knowledge of the Pentagon. The documentary even goes on to seriously discuss President Eisenhower’s alleged meeting with extraterrestrials, where agreements were reached with some of the visitors giving them permission to take some of the Earth’s resources in exchange for advanced technology.</p></blockquote>

<p>While these statements by Prime Minister Medvedev are remarkable, either for his surprisingly dry teasing, or for his unexpected disclosure, it should be noted that he’s not the first high-profile source to speak on extraterrestrials and what finding life could mean to humanity.</p>
<p>Indeed the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/vatican-prepares-for-extraterrestrial-disclosure" target="_blank">Vatican has already publicly discussed</a> their plan for extraterrestrial life, and former Canadian Cabinet Minister Paul Hellyer is well known for his stance on UFOs. These sources can be added to the list of <a href="http://www.syti.net/UFOSightings.html" target="_blank">former astronauts that detail their experiences</a> with unexplained phenomena and military and government coverups.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/radio/program.php?id=637" target="_blank">[RedIceRadio speaks with Paul Hellyer to discuss UFO issues, shadow government, and more]</a></p>
<p>What makes Medvedev’s words more interesting is a newly released document that is to be covered at <a href="http://redicecreations.com/article.php?id=23481" target="_blank">Davos &#8211; the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting of world leaders in business, banking, and politics. They’re meeting in Switzerland from the 23rd to 27th of January not only to discuss economics, but also to address financial crises, environmental challenges, and global government. </a><br />
Apparently, aliens are ALSO on the agenda.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eutimes.net/2013/01/russia-orders-obama-tell-world-about-aliens-or-we-will/" target="_blank">EUTimes.net</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Medvedev is scheduled to open this years Forum where as many as 50 heads of government, including Germany’s Angela Merkel and Britain’s David Cameron, will attend the five-day meeting that begins on 23 January.</p>
<p>Critical to note about this years Forum is that the WEF, in their <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-2013/section-one/executive-summary/" target="_blank">2013 Executive Summary</a>, scheduled for debate and discussion a number of items under their <b>X Factors from Nature</b> category, and which includes the “discovery of alien life” of which they state: <i>“Proof of life elsewhere in the universe could have profound psychological implications for human belief systems.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>From the Summary:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>X Factors from Nature</b></p>
<p>Developed in partnership with the editors of Nature, a leading science journal, the chapter on “X Factors” looks beyond the landscape of 50 global risks to alert decision-makers to five emerging game-changers:</p>
<p>- Runaway climate change: Is it possible that we have already passed a point of no return and that Earth’s atmosphere is tipping rapidly into an inhospitable state?</p>
<p>- Significant cognitive enhancement: Ethical dilemmas akin to doping in sports could start to extend into daily working life; an arms race in the neural “enhancement” of combat troops could also ensue.</p>
<p>- Rogue deployment of geoengineering: Technology is now being developed to manipulate the climate; a state or private individual could use it unilaterally.</p>
<p>- Costs of living longer: Medical advances are prolonging life, but long-term palliative care is expensive. Covering the costs associated with old age could be a struggle.</p>
<p><b>- </b>Discovery of alien life: Proof of life elsewhere in the universe could have profound psychological implications for human belief systems.</p>
<p>The Global Risks report is the flagship research publication of the World Economic Forum’s Risk Response Network, which provides an independent platform for stakeholders to explore ways to collaborate on building resilience to global risks. Further information can be found at <a href="http://www.weforum.org/risk" target="_blank">www.weforum.org/risk</a></p></blockquote>
<p>For the millions of people pressing for disclosure of the existence of extraterrestrial life and an end to the secrecy and coverup involved, this Davos ’Executive Summary’, and remarks by the PM of Russia, might mark yet another ’small step for mankind’ towards admission.</p>

<p>Let no man or woman dare speak of a shadow government. The crony corruptocrats that make up the ruling elites of the world must maintain the illusion, that elected governments are based upon willful consent and have the legitimate authority to establish rules of conduct that their citizen are obligated to obey. For those regimes that maintain their grip of power by undemocratic means, the apologists for the international community give a wide berth of acceptance in order to maintain the appearance of individual national sovereignty.</p>
<p>In the essay, <a href="http://batr.org/view_/041702.html">There Is No Conspiracy &#8211; Only Official Policy</a> provides a study in power politics when a banana republic dares defy the moneychangers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The lesson for world leaders is you don&#8217;t cross the masters of power. But for Americans it is that a world run by the IMF never benefits us, the people. The enactment of the FTAA is just one more element in the grand scheme of global rule. There is no need to dapple in extraordinary theories; it is all in the open for everyone to see. The policy is clear &#8211; the nations of the world are mere colonies to the interests of the ruling elites. Citizens of countries and their elected leaders are mere subjects of the international community. Not exactly the revered Republic that we all owe allegiance, is it?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The pattern of retribution against any tin horn leaders that refuse to succumb to the boot of the World Bank or the IMF is in plain sight. Just ask the mutilated and deceased <a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/030611.html">Muhammad al-Gaddafi</a> for testimony of the enforcement treatment one can expect for opposing the world financial plutocracy. While the imperium empire of drone warfare, targets governments that oppose the global hegemony, the behind the screens discord among varied vying factions often goes unnoticed.</p>
<p> The Constitution Society sees the nature of <a href="http://www.constitution.org/shad4816.htm">The Shadow Government</a> differently from most popular interpretations of the power elite.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the best indications that the Shadow Government is not centered in the financial sector are the things it has to do to finance itself. Shadow Government is expensive. We can identify the main sources of its revenue:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) Black budgets. This is the core of its operations, but is not enough to secure its control over the country and the world.</p>
<p>(2) Drug trade. It has seized control of the major part of the illegal traffic in addictive substances, in part by using the organs of law enforcement to eliminate competition, and by gaining control of the money and the ways it gets re-introduced into the economy.</p>
<p>(3) Raiding financial institutions. This is what was done with the S&amp;Ls, and is being done, more slowly, with the banks. It involves several aspects: diversion of the funds, seizure of smaller institutions by a few large ones under Shadow Government control, with the seizure financed by the taxpayers, and acquisition under distressed prices of the assets of those institutions, many of which are well-positioned business enterprises that give the Shadow Government both control of the key enterprises in most business sectors and sources of revenue. The Savings &amp; Loan raid was used to finance a major expansion of the Shadow Government. However, it is not a method that can be repeated.</p>
<p>(4) Public authorities. These are quasi-governmental enterprises that control substantial assets, often taxpayer-subsidized, without effective accountability. They include housing, port, energy, water, transportation, and educational authorities. To this might also be added various utilities, and both public and publicly-regulated private monopolies, like local telephone and cable companies. They are also a major source of government contracts.</p>
<p>(5) Government contracts. Major source of diverted funds, but must often be shared with others involved.</p>
<p>(6) Arms trade. Another major source of funds, both direct and diverted. But requires payoffs to local officials.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

What this viewpoint ignores is that the tactics of subversive operations frequently demand undercover execution and plausible deniability. The methods of covert operations conducted by black bag operatives avoid the question; who really controls the intelligence agencies? It is a fatal error to reject the prevalent role of the money center institutions and central banks in the unified network of financial control and global integration.</p>
<p>A more perceptive breakdown by <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread60574/pg1">Richard Boylan Ph.D.</a> offers a structural analysis of the secret &#8220;shadow&#8221; government.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the Shadow Government five branches may be identified. These branches are: the Executive Branch, the Intelligence Branch, the War Department, the Weapons Industry Branch, and the Financial Department.</p>
<p>An analysis of the overall purposes of these five branches suggests that the overall purpose of the Shadow Government is to exercise covert control by:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Collecting comprehensive institutional and personal information</p>
<p>2. By establishing national and international policy independently of the established Government</p>
<p>3. By developing high-tech arms and equipment, and, with these, establishing small, specialized, highly mobile, elite military units to effect these covert policies, when need arises, without having to rely on the official (and &#8220;unreliable&#8221;) Armed Services, (whose subservience to the Shadow Government is reasonably suspect)</p>
<p>4. By developing an armed capability to repel any threat to the status quo, (including the uncertain ontological, social, and economic impacts of any revelation of the reality of UFO and extraterrestrial presence) through the development of a Star Wars/BMDO ground and space-based surveillance and SDI weapons network</p>
<p>5. By denying information compromising to the Shadow Government from all those outside &#8220;need-to-know&#8221; policy-making levels</p>
<p>6. By exercising control on the money supply, availability of credit, and the worth of money, through policy decisions made outside of the official Government</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The essential political planetary threat that faces humanity is rooted in the globalist drive to accelerate their NWO plans for a neo-colonial feudal hierarchy. <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/092610.html">The New World Order Feudal Enslavement System</a> outlines the plot. However, the elements that comprise the surreptitious functions and assignments of shadow government missions need to maintain a clandestine secrecy to be effective. Stealth practices often foster perpetual public ignorance.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDGueH-D844" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrast this with maybe the best example of the most visible globalist institution that is used by the shadow elites as their private administration tool for worldwide compliance. The John Birch video <a href="http://youtu.be/ZDGueH-D844">U.N. and the United States | John F. McManus</a>presents the argument that Americanism is incompatible with the international community of collectivists that the United Nations is based upon.</p>
<p>The interminable public feuding in General Assembly sessions are sheer spectacle for the uninformed. The real dirty work is done behind the scenes through coerced implementation of programs like <a href="http://www.dalegreen.us/AGENDA21.html">Agenda 21</a>.The best way to come out of the shadows is to strip back the curtain. Effectiveness dictates that the banksters and corporatists use the dark art of intrigue and subterfuge to manipulate the systems of governance, which they put in place, to serve their own interests.</p>
<p>The destruction of the unique American experiment falls upon the treason of the ruling class. <a href="http://ourfoundingtruth.blogspot.com/2009/09/john-calvins-influence-on-james-madison.html">Human Depravity, James Madison, and The Founding Fathers</a> explains the nature of the existential internal threat that destroyed the essence of the old Republic. Madison wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we were all like angels, blameless and freely able to exercise perfect control, we would not need rules or regulations. Why, then, do we have so many laws and statutes? Because of man&#8217;s wickedness, for he is constantly overflowing with evil; this is why a remedy is required.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When the shadow government usurps the stated original limited authorities and separations of powers, the citizens of the country are relegated to a menu entrée on the feasting table of the power elites. The globalism agenda is the objective of the shadow government. Participates need not be spooks or machinates. Those who influence the operations of the sub-rosa establishment may wear the garb of Illuminati or use the signals of secret societies, but most are pure button down internationalists.</p>
<p>The populace is viewed as useless eaters to the elites, who labor to drive a wedge between government and the ordinary man. The privileged oligarchs see themselves as the ennobled in the entitlement enslavement society of their creation. Keeping the masses dependent until the ultimate elimination of dissenters is the objective.</p>
<p>The specter of the shadow government has always been part of the inner conflict for national integrity. The difference at this time is that it is all pervasive. The United States has become a global empire designed to impose an internationalist monitory yoke around the neck of subservient serfs.</p>
<p>The money machine of shadow banking practiced by the <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/062712.html">Bank for International Settlements on Big Banks</a> is a prime component of the definitive ruling elite comradeship. Governments are no longer sovereign entities. They function as subsidiaries of the global satanic New World Order conglomerate. The <em>crony corruptocrats</em> bury deep their crimes and give new meaning to being above the law. Without a widespread public awakening, the forces of wickedness will triumph.</p>
<p>Less we forget . . . <em>&#8220;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&#8221;</em> <a href="http://bible.cc/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a></p>

<p><img title="XDrone" src="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/XDrone.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="272" /></p>
</div>
<p>The emergence of new drone technologies have captured the public’s imagination, as well as sparked controversy, especially since the arrival of the US Navy’s show-stealing X-47B drone. With its triangular shape, non-existent tail, and sleek, almost saucerian look, the aircraft succeeds in resembling classic descriptions of flying saucers dating all the way back to the 1940s.</p>
<p>As a journalist, one never wants to spend too much time discussing his or her own experiences, opting instead to present a fair, unbiased perspective on such subjects. However, my purpose here is hardly to dissect the controversies surrounding drone use in military operations, border patrol operations, or even surveillance in urban areas. Rather, my reason for addressing the drones on a personal note has to do with my own recent observation of some variety of small, controlled aircraft for which, at present, remains unidentified… and quite perplexing.</p>
<p><a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/x47b-09.jpeg"><img title="x47b-09" src="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/x47b-09-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>My unusual sighting of what I take to be some variety of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) began with the appearance of a curiously bright light moving along over Interstate 26, just outside Asheville, North Carolina, as I was heading home for the evening; I had been traveling north at about 10:22 PM on the evening of July 23, 2012, headed for the junction with Interstate 40 about a mile away. This white-orange light appeared to simply be hanging in the sky, unmoving, and though I suspected the landing lights of some commercial kind of aircraft, the object in question did not seem to move as my position changed relative to it.</p>
<p>Following my previously stated course, heading northbound along I-26 toward the I-40 junction, I came up alongside the object, which was partially obscured by trees at the time. At this point, I had begun to think what I must be seeing was a helicopter, as it appeared to be hovering in midair, or otherwise moving in some way inconsistent with a commercial airliner. The bright light had apparently been oriented toward the front of the craft, and on the sides I could now see a small flashing white light (making it seem like some kind of conventional craft, yet again), in addition to bluish green and red lights.</p>
<p>The blue lights were uncharacteristic, however, and caught my attention since this color typically does not appear on commercial aircraft of any kind (for more on this, click <a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0263.shtml">here</a> for a discussion of various beacons used on airplanes for different purposes and applications). This would not be the case, however, for a hobby craft or remote-controlled stunt plane… but then again, this “plane” appeared to be hovering at the moment, hence my mind began to drift along toward the potential for a helicopter.</p>
<p>At this point I pulled off to the side of the road, and jumped out of my car right there on the connecting ramp between I-26 and I-40, hoping to get a better look at the craft. The object began to drift along slowly toward the south; curiously, the lighting on the craft did seem to betray a generally airplane-like shape, looking nothing like a helicopter. Furthermore, the object, which had been almost at a standstill there in the sky, had appeared to be moving silently, and as stated, quite slowly (there were few cars near me on the interstate, and I could hear no sounds that seemed to come from this object that reminded me of helicopter blades). Finally, it is also worth noting that the object appeared much smaller than the average airplane, and at a relatively low altitude (just a few hundred feet). My guess would have been that the object was roughly the size of a large automobile.</p>
<p><a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TriangleUFO.jpeg"><img title="TriangleUFO" src="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TriangleUFO-300x263.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="263" /></a>It was a very odd combination of something very conventional-looking, and yet which behaved very counter-intuitively just as well. At present, while I am leaning heavily toward this object being some kind of UAV drone, perhaps serving some military or other surveillance purposes, what’s interesting is that, in years past, I know of two other individuals who have described seeing a similar object, albeit one described as being more triangular in shape, and at the same precise location!</p>
<p>Sure enough, a friend of mine, Tyler Pittman, described an experience where he had seen a triangular object at the precise same spot, heading North, which at it’s closest was directly above him. He too pulled off the side of the road hoping to photograph the thing, which was about the size of a large automobile, he said; but it managed to get away before he could get to the camera on his phone. Finally, at roughly the same spot, my own brother Caleb, who had a friend in the car with him at the time, also described seeing this triangular shape in the sky a few years back, near the junction between I-26 and I-40.</p>
<p>It is interesting indeed that my own brother had this experience a while ago, and that all our recollections of the craft seem to correlate in terms of descriptions, for the most part. But here’s where things get even more interesting: the night after my own encounter, Caleb and a friend had been attending an outdoor showing of the original “Ghostbusters” film at an area theater, when the two of them spotted an object overhead which was, according to Caleb, obviously the same craft I’d seen. He sent me the following at 10:01 PM on Tuesday, July 24, 2012, via SMS text messages:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m watching ghost busters outside at (Biltmore Cinnebar Theatres) and that triangular drone you saw last night is flying around overhead. Both Dakota and I saw it. It has a very wide range, flashing lights but definitely triangular. I don’t think it’s privately owned because I don’t think they’d allow it in the air, I’m going to go with that it is a drone.</p></blockquote>
<p>He followed with this as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Got a great look at it… Dakota (a mutual friend, and my brother’s roommate) and I have some decent theories of what it might be but I really have no doubt at all that it is some kind of drone. I didn’t see it hover but it was moving pretty slowly for the altitude it was at.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like my own sighting the night before, Caleb also noted the blue lights, in addition to the triangular shape:</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw blue, red, orange and white lights; definitely triangular. I saw it coming from pretty far away over the car dealership (Jim Barkley Toyota, on Brevard Road adjacent to the shopping mall where they were located at the time) then it flew over and headed towards the airport but circled around and flew over us again at what seemed like a different angle… maybe sideways. The lights had a pattern to them but they seemed to strobe in a slightly different manor than an airplane.</p></blockquote>
<p>This description certainly matches my own feeling about the craft I’d seen; certain aspects reminded me very much of an airplane, while others (namely its apparent ability to hover and drift along slowly) are very unconventional. Next, I plan to touch base with local law enforcement, and see if anyone else has information on what the object may have been. Do any <em>Mysterious Universe </em>readers recall seeing similar objects themselves, and if so, what are your conclusions about the aircraft you had seen?</p>

<p>Red Ice Radio has gathered together some of the most important research and opinions on what might be the motivations, the plans, the symbolism, the purposes, and the potential outcomes of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Hours of interviews and examination have culminated in a body of knowledge that breaks down the mainstream narrative and alerts the public to be aware in 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2012/07/RIR-120716.php" target="_blank">Listen to our entire 2½ hour Olympics Special</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be death? Mayhem? Terrorist attacks?</p>
<p>Will terrible catastrophes usher in a new era of war and control? A New World Order?</p>
<p>Will the stars align and inaugurate a dynamic of peace and goodwill among humanity? A new paradigm of consciousness?</strong></p>
<p>These possibilities and more have been speculated upon for the years leading up to 2012, and now that time is upon us. The London 2012 Olympics have arrived with much anticipation, but whether one sees this as a glorious time to celebrate the union of athletic champions, or instead a cause for raising alarm, is a matter debated by many.</p>
<p>There are plenty of clues that suggests that the Olympic “celebration” and many of the surrounding events and installations are part of an “occult mega ritual”, and one can’t help to wonder exactly who it is supposed to benefit?</p>
<p>According to the Greek history, the first Olympic games were dedicated to the twelve Olympian gods, and were based on ancient mythology and religion. The tradition and special meaning of the games &#8211; the heroic competition and the fantastic effort to combine mind, body, and will in a attuned whole &#8211; is what energizes the games to this day.</p>
<p>But what other ’special meanings’ can be found in the modern Olympic games?</p>

Listen to the entire 2½ hour program here</a>.</p>

<p>***</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2012/05/RIR-120520-hr2.html" target="_blank"><strong>Ian Crane</strong></a> - Ian reasserts the importance of a careful approach to esoteric, occult and conspiratorial subject matters. He also talks about the phenomenal acceleration into global governance unfolding before our eyes and discusses the extraordinary militarization of London: 49,000 troops will be present for the games &#8211; but what are they guarding against?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The London Olympics, in my opinion&#8230; are going to be used as a platform to springboard the introduction of global governance.</p>
<p>London is already the most surveilled capital on the planet, but of course what’s coming up in the next few weeks with the Olympics is just unbelievable. We are looking at an area of the city of London literally becoming THE most securitized place on the planet with the possible exception of the West Bank, or Gaza. It is absolutely horrendous.</p>
<p>We’ve got helicopter carriers in the River Thames. We’ve got anti-aircraft missiles being placed on the roofs of apartment blocks around the Olympic area&#8230;<br />
The British government is doing its best to encourage long-serving police officers who joined up for all the right reasons to leave, to take early retirement. And what they’re being replaced with is basically thugs&#8230;.<br />
We are literally seeing the privatization of policing so what we’re ending up with is the equivalent of night-club bouncers policing the streets.</p>
<p>&#8230;there’s a situation here where it’s NORMALIZING these outrageous excesses.”<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Listen to the interview we did with Ian Crane from May 22, 2008, that started much of this research:<br />
<a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2008/05may/RICR-080522-SUB.php" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2008/05may/RICR-080522-SUB.jpg" alt="" border="0" /><br />
Ian Crane &#8211; The New World Order’s Quest for Zion in 2012</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=4789" target="_blank"><strong>Rik Clay</strong></a>- Rik discusses his findings about the ’Zion Olympics’ in London leading up to the end game year 2012. Rik presents a connection with numerology and synchronicity and delves into: 11:11, pyramid numerology, Solar Eclipse, September Eleventh, The Birth of Christ, Zion, and more.<br />
Rik couples all this with the &#8220;new age&#8221; and how an &#8220;end game messiah&#8221; will be presented to us around 2012.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“ If you shuffle the Olympics 2012 logo around, you can spell the word ‘ZION’. Obviously Zion stands for the term ‘New Jerusalem’.</p>
<p>First thing that was brought to my mind was the poem by William Blake. William Blake wrote a poem in the 18th century called “Jerusalem”. Blake was a known 18th century esotericist with connections to the Freemasons. When we talk about Olympics 2012, we’re talking about something that’s been planned for hundreds of years&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;this occult symbology is working on the subconscious, and it’s working on the subconscious of the global population, then it’s got the ability to bring itself forward into matter.</p>
<p>You’ve got a number of roads that circle [the Olympic] site&#8230;<br />
All the way around the Olympics 2012 site, which you could call &#8220;Zion&#8221; if you go with the logo, it’s biblical road names surrounding the whole site. There’s not one road name that’s not biblical. You start looking at that and you think ’what the hell is going on?’</p>
<p>There’s this crazy CGI ‘action film’ on how they’re going to build the Olympic 2012 stadium. This has got it all in it. Basically within 40 seconds of this video there’s four chimneys that stand like an 11:11, but then it moves into the most significant symbology you could ever see &#8211; an “Independence Day” style mother ship, little UFOs flying all around. Then it ends in robotic streetwalkers in the middle of London, stomping around the place towards the Olympic stadium.<br />
Does this mean there is a significant event looming for the Olympics?”<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2012/03/RIR-120322-hr2.html" target="_blank"><strong>David Icke</strong></a> - David interprets an ’energetic’ perspective on the Zion Olympics. He describes mass ritual, symbols and energy vampirism. How many people will be tuning in? What kind of energy and intention will be poured into these events from around the world?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8221; 2012, whatever we think about it, it’s a focus year&#8230;</p>
<p>And of course the most blatant and obvious symbol of the Olympics is the lighted torch. And what do they do? They light the fire and the flame goes throughout the games.<br />
There is a synchronicity of all this, and London, and 2012, that means that it is very, very important to them.</p>
<p>Energy flows where attention goes.</p>
<p>Billions and billions of people worldwide, during the London games are going to be focused on London.</p>
<p>It’s all about energy. It’s all about manipulation of energy, manipulation of information fields, so that you subconsciously, subliminally manipulate people’s perception of reality.&#8221;<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.williamhenry.net/" target="_blank"><strong>William Henry</strong></a> - William wonders if the dwellers of Sion will return in 2012. Will there be a disclosure of sorts, heralded by the London Olympics? Williams mentions the return of Quetzecoatl, the feathered serpent and explains how the symbols used during the Olympics are pointing to the opening of a StarGate. Lines blur mythology and iconography &#8211; which is light, dark, good or bad?</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
“You’ve got this rainbow motif going directly connected with Sion, and here we’re talking about these mascots manifesting as rainbow beings of the games&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s coincidental, it’s fun, it means nothing&#8230; but it might mean a lot actually. It might mean EVERYTHING.<br />
There’s unquestionably another layer of meaning that is here to be interpreted with all this symbolism in London.</p>
<p>&#8230;it became clear that this is exactly how a cabal or a New World Order group would introduce this new world religion.<br />
It would be at a global ceremony such as this&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;those with eyes to see get the message.”<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2012/07/RIR-120715.php" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2012/07/RIR-120715.jpg" alt="" align="right" border="0" /><strong>Ben Fellows</strong></a> - Ben, an investigative journalist specialising in undercover work, warns that the security is a ridiculous sham and, worse than being simply theatre, is a real threat to the safety of all involved in the London Olympics. After infiltrating the G4S company in charge of security and seeing the alarming failings throughout, he speaks out on the disaster that’s waiting to happen.<br />
The English Home Office now scrambles to ‘fill in the gaps’ with increased troop presence. Will this rectify anything, or is this ’outrage’ a way to dodge accountability if a terrorist event occurs?</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
“&#8230;This is dangerous stuff&#8230;</p>
<p>I’m not going to the Olympics. Everyone who knows me has actually given their ticket back &#8230; because they don’t want to go because they all feel it’s unsafe as well.</p>
<p>Most of the x-ray operators I spoke to in my class were scared. They were terrified. They’d turn round to me and say &#8220;Look, we’re missing, basically, major objects coming through.&#8221; I had to actually pretend to be a would-be terrorist. I was given a knife, I was given a gun, I was given this fake IED to go through. The walk-through metal detector don’t pick up the gun or the knife because there’s not enough metal in them. &#8220;Here’s a phone, here’s some keys&#8221;, and then it went off. The x-ray officer wasn’t even looking in the bag with the IED in it.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is a dirty bomb, probably which is already in the stadium&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;the Olympic stadium has got quite a lot of radioactive material in the ground. They used to deal with a lot of radioactive material there. And the radioactive material that’s in the ground is something called thorium that has a half-life of about 14 billion years, or something crazy. It’s really devastating stuff&#8230;<br />
If a bomb were to go off, even a fairly small sized bomb, thorium has a property to it whereby it becomes a lot more explosive and so it would increase the explosion.</p>
<p>The best case scenario, I suppose, is that they’re just incompetent and out to steal money.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Listen to our entire interview with Ben: <a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2012/07/RIR-120715.php" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.chadstuemke.com/home/" target="_blank"><strong>Chad Stuempke</strong></a> - Chad looks at ancient sacred landscapes, star-gate parks, and deciphers cosmic symbolism found therein. He suggests that our symbolism originates from the cosmos &#8211; it’s subconsciously downloaded from the Artisan Architects.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
“There’s a LOT of intentional symbolism going on&#8230; a lot of it’s backing up the conspiracy theories that have been swirling around, in particular the ’Zion’ and ’New Jerusalem’&#8230; in particular the rainbow symbolism, the gateway symbolism, that I believe isn’t necessarily intentional&#8230; the Illuminati, so to speak, isn’t behind it.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve been watching these urban portals and cosmic parks being brought to fruition, in particular special places and special times. I’ve been watching this 2012 Olympic park being built and, coinciding the research, it didn’t take long to realize that a lot of this symbolism is the same things we’ve been looking at previously.<br />
They’re literally bringing into fruition a cosmic park&#8230; This may be some sort of symbolic disclosure that’s emanating from the cosmos.</p>
<p>Both aliens and giants have made appearances in opening ceremonies over the last couple of decades. It kinda started in 1984 in Los Angeles. They lowered the&#8230; UFO, down into the stadium during closing ceremonies &#8211; it was a seven foot, eight inch, ’giant’ as the announcer said, dressed in an alien suit. It got out and talked to the crowd, saluted the crowd. He was proud of the Olympic ideals.”</p>
<p></em></p></blockquote>

</div>
<p><a href="http://theopenscroll.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Bob Schlenker</strong></a> - Bob studies the hidden meanings and patterns found in religion and culture, and ties them into what is unfolding in the London Olympic Games of 2012. He warns that blood rituals and dark societies are driving humanity towards something ominous.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
&#8220;I look for anything that speaks to me of an occult intent, that there’s a ritual behind it. There’s a number of themes I’ve been tracking in other places, and there’s a cross-threading with the Olympics really heavily.<br />
It’s really sinister. It looks like there’s a threat behind almost all of it.<br />
The nature of the mass ritual suggests some things that really need our attention.</p>
<p>I don’t know who is in the know and who is not, but people do give direction about these things. It’s the way of the occult operations of the Illuminati and the Masons and all the secret societies to announce in advance what’s going on.<br />
It’s part of the rules of engagement.&#8221;<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.expansions.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Stewart Swerdlow</strong></a> - Stewart cautions people to be watchful in 2012 for false flag attempts, especially under the guise of a dramatic alien war. The powers that be have been embedding symbols and scenarios into our consciousness for years, and 2012 might be the ’end game’ where they employ high technologies and mind control to subvert humanity through fear and horror, and establish a new, unimagined grip upon the globe.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><br />
“It is my belief , and I may be wrong, but this might be the perfect opportunity for the Illuminati to stage an alien invasion with billions of people focused on one place on the earth at one time. They can have anything in the sky with the Bluebeam Project, they can use the missiles to fire at them. They can make quite an event.</p>
<p>It’s a time of many things coming together to leave it as a simple event &#8211; the Illuminati would never let that happen, of course. It’s the year 2012, so it’s the ‘end times’ according to the Mayan calendar … It is also the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. It is also in London, the center of the global empire, so there’s many factors coming together all at once&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s a very symbolic time and we can expect something to happen of a global proportion.”<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>***</p>
<p>We must all wait and see what will unfold during the 2012 London Olympic Games. It may be that all of these things may occur, or something might happen that we could not possibly have imagined or anticipated. The games might begin and end and nothing of significance will seem to have occurred on the grand stage.</p>
<p>Yet for a time our mass consciousness will have been captured, and the symbolism of the global Olympics will have been driven even more deeply into our psyches.</p>
<p>A new ’normal’ will have been established regarding high security, fractured privacy, and invasive surveillance, at least. An incredible trauma will shape us and make us more pliant and fearful, at worst.</p>
<p>Whatever occurs, the London 2012 Olympics will be seen and remembered as a real game changer.</p>

			<p><strong>Our Survival Depends On Learning To Recognize Him&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/TheAntichrist3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/TheAntichrist2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Today we are witnessing the complete breakdown of our institutions. This is true in finance, banking, and government. The bald fact confronts us at the gas pump and in the supermarket. It is true in education, where we pay heavily to ensure our children learn only to find, instead, they are being propagandized and their presence in schools used to assert control over how they are raised.</p>
<p>War has become our continual condition. Young people are enticed and coerced into the military through promises, which will not be kept, and economic conditions which leave them no choices. They come home inflicted with PTSD,TBI, struggling to function. Many die of suicide, or on the streets, homeless.</p>
<p>Our courts have long since ceased being the dispassionate tribunal where the condition and wealth of those standing before it does not matter. Corruption, purchased verdicts, and greed, drive those who were entrusted with ensuring equal access to justice for all Americans.</p>
<p>Law enforcement, police, prisons, and its management and infrastructure, moved into fast forward over a decade ago. The police know nothing about the Constitution or our rights. Their training is militarized. Prisons have become corporate profit centers, expanding due to the proliferation of laws which bolster their bottom line, sucking money out of the pockets of Americans.</p>
<p>We have been told it is right and proper to bail out irresponsible and predatory corporations &#8211; but individuals who paid into Social Security must pull in their belts and live on less on less – even as the cost of food continues to climb monthly, edging them toward starvation.</p>
<p>Organic dairies and gardening are under attack, while GMO is fast tracked.</p>
<p>The middle class has all but disappeared, leaving only the wealthy &#8211; and the rest of us.</p>
<p>In every part we confront the growth of restrictions and controls, limitations of our right to choose for ourselves.</p>
<p>We look into each others eyes and ask, “What happened?”</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard many theories and watched as attempts to correct the corruption failed. Checks and balances have also been hijacked. These are all failing because the foundational problem was not recognized.</p>
<p>The electoral process has been hijacked. From the presentation of candidates, until the votes are counted, the whole is managed through a process which includes media owned by what I call Greedville, in the case of media seven large, global corporations which are all controlled by psychopaths. Information, now divorced from facts, is filtered through systems for nomination and voting managed outside of the public view.</p>
<p>The presence of psychopaths among us is the problem.</p>
<p>Normal people could never pull this off. Normal people have consciences. Our unseen problem has been those without conscience, the psychopathic, who concentrate where they have access to power, changing institutional practices and culture, looting the system.</p>
<p>Humanity needs to understand and take action. In this series we will lay out causes and what can be done to take back our world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand psychopathy through the case of Alexander, 13<sup>th</sup> Duke of Manchester, psychopath.</li>
<li>The strategies used by psychopaths</li>
<li>How our institutions fail to account for psychopathic behavior.</li>
<li>How psychopaths manipulate the emotionally normal to work for them.</li>
<li>Understand the impact of their presence among us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alexander, 13<sup>th</sup> Duke of Manchester</strong></p>
<p><em>The Early Life of a Psychopath</em></p>
<p>Allow me to introduce you to the poster boy for Psychopathy, His Grace, Alexander, the 13<sup>th</sup> Duke of Manchester, or Alexander Montagu, though during his criminal career he has used other names in plenty. He is not a smart psychopath, but his life illustrates many truths about the condition.</p>
<p>Alexander Montagu is one of the hundreds of thousands of those without conscience walking among us. This assertion is supported by a wealth of evidence from multiple sources over a period spanning decades.</p>
<p>His condition was first identified by a psychiatrist named Dr. Barry Williamson, who attended him in 1984 when he was institutionalized for assault with a spear gun and attempted suicide.  At the time he was on welfare, received because he was deemed &#8216;disabled.&#8217;</p>
<p>Montagu was treated at <a href="http://www.sjog.org.au/hospitals/pinelodge_clinic/hospital_services/psychiatric_services/inpatients.aspx" target="_blank">Pine Lodge Clinic,</a> according to the transcript.</p>
<p>Dr. Williamson&#8217;s  comment, made to Montagu&#8217;s solicitor Mr. Zoltan Varszeghy, who has now returned to Hungary, is included. The comment entered into the court record was, <em>“Dr. Williamson attended him there. Dr. Williamson has in fact told me he has psychopathic tendencies.”</em> The full transcript can be viewed.

<p>Montagu was then facing charges of assault against his wife and at least one police officer with a spear gun.</p>
<p>His behavior as a child was disruptive, both according to his mother, this supplied in emails, and according to his brother Kimble, information provided in a <a href="http://www.thedukeanddoxieofmanchester.info/2012/04/declaration-by-kimble-montagu-given-for.html" target="_blank">declaration</a> given in 2011.</p>
<p>Alexander was expelled twenty times from the school he attended in Beverly Hills and from every other school where he was placed, according  to his mother, Lady Mary Montagu. He failed to develop relationships with either of his siblings, both of whom grew up to live normal, stable, lives.</p>
<p><em>This is an identifying characteristic of a psychopath.</em></p>
<p>His relationship with his mother is one of demanding his needs be serviced while he provides nothing in return.</p>
<p><em>Another psychopathic characteristic; he is entitled.</em></p>
<p>He has borrowed money from his sister, Emma, and never repaid the funds and his brother, Kimble was also called upon for assistance, despite the fact Kimble is not close to him and so testified in his <a href="http://www.thedukeanddoxieofmanchester.info/2012/04/declaration-by-kimble-montagu-given-for.html" target="_blank">declaration</a> given under penalty of perjury for the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, in July of 2011.</p>
<p>Borrowing money from others, or receiving services, activates a strategy which his former wife,Wendy Buford, reported seeing played out many times.</p>
<p>After receiving funds or services Montagu  distances himself from the individual, who he vilifies.  He then picks a fight, and refuses to carry through with his promise for payment or repayment.  It is always their fault, never his.</p>
<p>This is the concept of &#8216;splitting,&#8217; used by the disordered. The targeted victim is either all good, when they are being used; or all bad, when he is finished with them.</p>
<p><em>This is a standard strategy common to psychopaths.</em></p>
<p>The vilification strategy also includes assault by slander, a massive campaign to destroy the reputation of the individual who is no longer useful to him. Relatives, journalists, business partners, former wives, and friends have all experienced this parting gift from Montagu.</p>
<p>When discovered in a crime Montagu blames others. During Montagu&#8217;s recent arraignment for passing a bad check in Las Vegas he, or his wife, variously claimed it was a case of mistaken identity, use of the wrong checkbook, or a plot carried out to embarrass him.</p>
<p>This frequently works for him  because he is titled, and because, as a psychopath, he shows no sense of guilt or shame.  He lies smoothly and constantly, remaking reality as he believes it will work to persuade his victim to perform as he wants.</p>
<p>Having thoroughly victimized his target Montagu positions himself as the victim.  This is a strategy known as, the &#8216;Turn Around.&#8217;</p>
<p><em>This also is characteristic of psychopaths.</em></p>
<p>All successful con men are psychopaths.  Police in Australia identified Alexander Montagu as a <em>&#8220;highly successful con-man,&#8217; </em>by the time he was 29 years of age, this remark memorialized in an article written about him in the <em>Australian Post</em> in May of 1991.  This classification of psychopath is not necessarily violent, but is, nonetheless, psychopathic.  Murderers such as <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Paul Bernardo, Clifford Olson, John Wayne Gacy may be serial killers, smiling as they murder, but most psychopaths, such as Montagu, are subclinical, meaning they avoid punishment because their crimes are financial or less egregious forms of abuse than murder &#8211; but still costly and damaging to their victims.</span></span></p>
<p>This term, used by Robert Hare, the recognized world expert on psychopathy, includes individuals who, who, like Montagu are dangerous and unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>A difference in the brain</strong></p>
<p>The source of psychopathy is in the brain itself.   A  <a href="http://psychcentral.com/news/2011/11/25/a-psychopaths-brain-is-different/31866.html" target="_blank">study</a> carried out at the University of Wisconsin-Madison by researchers found a variance while studying images of prisoners’ brains.  These revealed that psychopaths have reduced connections between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the part of the brain responsible for sentiments such as empathy and guilt, and the amygdala,  reconciling fear and<a href="http://psychcentral.com/disorders/anxiety/" target="_blank">anxiety</a>.</p>
<p>Because psychopaths do not feel emotions,fear or empathy, they do not experience love or guilt.  Normal humans reference emotional states and their actions and choices are dictated and limited by their feelings. These characteristics are shared by all normal humans and human institutions are designed, taking into account concern for others and a working conscience.</p>
<p>A normal individual cannot lie without experiencing anxiety. This is the basis of the Lie Detector.  A psychopath feels no anxiety when he is lying, for him lying is normal behavior.  This helps to explain how our institutions have been converted by the psychopathic for their own profit. As normal humans we sense when someone is anxious, this can lead us to believe they are lying – and to the assumption those without anxiety are telling the truth.</p>
<p>Psychopaths who are subclinical, formulate their strategies for getting what they want from experimenting with what works to accomplish their goals. Over the last centuries, and especially during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, psychopaths have intentionally, and actively, worked to convert our institutions to a centralized model which allowed them to have control.</p>
<p>How this took place is the subject of a later article.</p>
<p>An examination of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal government, finance, our infrastructure for regulation, among others, shows how these can, in effect, become operational tools for the highly psychopathic, who are concentrated in these specific areas.</p>
<p>Estimates of the percentage of the psychopathic in finance is believed to be far larger than the general population. Theories of the impact of psychopaths on corporate culture have been, according to Robert Hare, PhD., and growing number of experts and observers, highly significant.</p>
<p>In a paper appearing in the Journal of Business Ethics, 2011, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAAOAo&amp;url=http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/fulltext.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1269145-p35739432&amp;ei=HYF6T623Joae8gStm72CBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCtl7zm-4RtStwHiaUqUfeRq7KJQ&amp;sig2=Xj5QF6rnL1J-PwZo8ElOOw" target="_blank"><em>“The Corporate Psychopaths Theory for Global Financial Crisis,” </em></a>written by Clive R. Boddy and copyrighted by Springer, cites the need for further study of the impact of psychopaths in the corporate environment, pointing out the &#8216;strengths&#8217; of psychopaths, charisma, self-confidence, and presentation, allow them to claim credit for successes for which they are not responsible. Since they lack conscience this is most likely to happen. Psychopaths are not troubled when they walk away with huge remuneration, leaving the company to falter and die. In recent days, we have often watches this take place.</p>
<p>The theory is receiving serious consideration in business and studies are continuing.</p>
<p>Psychopaths operating on the level of banking, finance, and other institutions function on a higher level level than Montagu. They are more intelligent and are more able to emulate emotions. They are smoother and far more difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Montagu is an example of a lower level psychopath, he routinely threatens violence and has been violent, witness his several convictions for assault in Australia.  He, however, learned to modify the amount of violence to ensure he would not again face incarceration.</p>
<p>All psychopaths tend to find successful strategies and repeat them. Psychopaths, regardless of intelligence, are limited in innovation. But they are skilled in manipulation and control. They have a radar sense of knowing what the normal person expects and use this to gain trust and access to whatever they are trying obtain from the victim. They wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing, waiting for the moment to strike.</p>
<p><em>Manipulation and control are standard tools for psychopaths.</em></p>
<p>Montagu&#8217;s subsequent acts illustrate the desire for immediate gratification, ability to ignore potential hazards, and ability to rewrite reality to fit into the lies he was telling to engage possible victims.</p>
<p><em>This is typical of the psychopath, category - </em><a href="http://lifestealers.homestead.com/Characeristics-checklist.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>Egocentric and Grandiose</strong></em></span><em></em></a></p>
<p>In 1988 Montagu had openly solicited marriage by purchase for the title of Duchess. In another article, titled, <a href="http://www.thedukeanddoxieofmanchester.info/2012/04/1988-people-my-barmy-marriage-by-ian.html" target="_blank"><em>“My Barmy Marriage.” </em></a>written the same year in The People, Marion Stoner reacts, offering her story, having read Montagu was attempting to profit by marriage.</p>
<p>She had been unable to find him to serve papers, she reported in the article. She goes on to outline what transpired to a small degree. Her <a href="http://www.thedukeanddoxieofmanchester.info/2012/03/application-for-separation-filed-by.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: small;">Application for Separation  </span></a>, given under penalty of perjury, is more forthcoming and reads like a horror story. Other documents, found <a href="http://www.thedukeanddoxieofmanchester.info/2012/03/marion-stoner-first-marriage-of.html" target="_blank">here</a>, support her statements.</p>
<p>1991 found Montagu arrested for entering Canada. The title of the article,<span style="font-size: x-small;"> <a href="http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=o2AgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vGUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2681%2C4690778" target="_blank">Diana&#8217;s Cousin Selling Title</a>appeared on September 21, 1991  in the Sun Jou</span>rnal. The reason for his arrest appears at the end, <em>“He was arrested for allegedly entering Canada illegally from Hong Kong on June 17<sup>th</sup>. Immigration officials say he failed to disclose 29 criminal convictions for fraud and assault in Australia.”</em></p>
<p>Montagu knew he was not divorced from his first wife, Marion Stoner, who he had assaulted and lethally threatened with a spear gun, after less than three months of marriage. The spear missed Marion&#8217;s friend&#8217;s head, also present, by half an inch.</p>
<p>Today Montagu asserts, against all existing proof, several conflicting stories. He tells people Marion Stoner never existed. He tells people the wedding was a gag. He tells people his mother flubbed the annulment, and he tells people his mother had a long term plot to get the title of Duke for his younger brother. The story used depends on what he thinks will work.</p>
<p>Proof means nothing to a psychopath. Reality is what they say it is. This can sometimes work against them in several ways.</p>
<p><strong>Viscount Mandeville solves the problem of being deported and homeless.</strong></p>
<p>And, as a testament to how easily the psychopath, even a less intelligent psychopath, can manipulate normal people, let us consider how Montagu managed to stay in a relationship with Wendy Buford Montagu for 15 years, years fraught with trauma for her.</p>
<p>Montagu originally married Wendy because he was running out of money and was in danger of being deported. Married to an American woman with a job evidently became his goal. Wendy reported Alexander was supposedly living with his business partner but had his own car. She later learned he was borrowing the car owned by his business partner&#8217;s girl friend, claiming to own it.</p>
<p>The entire relationship can truthfully be characterized as one outrage after another.</p>
<p>Montagu married Buford in 1993, just before the birth of their son, Alexander, Jr., his first act was to demand she visit the immigration office to prove they were legally married (a lie) so he could evade deportation, which he said was about to take place due to the threats of his business partner. Within weeks of their first date he had insinuated himself into her apartment and was using her car as his own. His business partner&#8217;s girl friend had reclaimed her automobile.</p>
<p>Over the next 15 years the couple was evicted 11 times, each time because Alexander spent the money for rent or the mortgage elsewhere. Wendy was never permitted to know anything about their finances. Asking if the rent was paid was pointless. Alexander would always lie.</p>
<p>When evicted for non-payment of rent or mortgage, he focused anger on the landlord, routinely destroying the property. This has included pouring cement down the toilets. according to his present wife Laura.  With Montagu the barrage of such behavior was constant and consistent, according to his wife of 15 years, Wendy Buford Montagu.</p>
<p>Since Montagu never had a job it was his wife&#8217;s income from her job which was garnisheed.  Today, Wendy is still paying off these debts.</p>
<p>Although his mother, Lady Mary, carried the paperwork for the Stoner divorce in 1996, asking Alexander only to sign and return papers.</p>
<p>After the divorce Lady Mary ordered him to remarry Wendy, who had no idea he had been married to Marion Stoner at the time of their wedding. Alexander never mentioned the matter. He had lied on their marriage license, checking, &#8216;never married,&#8217; instead of &#8216;married but annulled,&#8217; which had been an option. He had not mentioned an annulment, but one of his alternative reality stories would be blaming his mother for not finishing an annulment which there is no record had ever been filed.</p>
<p>Yet if Alexander had not, himself, informed the Trustees, the matter would have died there. Alexander, whose life, like all psychopaths, is filled with chaos, decided to divorce Wendy after he succeeded to the title of Duke in 2002, while waiting for the sale of the Manchester Jewels to provide him with funds.</p>
<p>Wendy could not help but notice he started going to the tanning salon, had his teeth redone, and spending other money on himself from a household budget which was slim at best. Overweight, he also had a colon reduction so he could slim down. Naturally, he lied to Wendy, telling her the surgery was covered by insurance and was for his back. This deception worked for him until she came to pick him up at the hospital and asked the nurse how the back surgery had gone.</p>
<p>Their divorce from a non-existent marriage was orchestrated by Montagu with the intention of gaining custody of the children so Wendy would be required to pay him both alimony and child support.</p>
<p>Filing a false report of violence, he received a temporary order excluding her from the family home. Wendy, realizing what was happening, cooperated completely with the court and went through an intense, expensive, and humiliating process which proved she did not take drugs, was not an alcoholic, and was not violent. Wendy was awarded physical custody of both children, who were turned over to her without any of their possessions and dressed in only their pajamas.</p>
<p>Alexander made none of the court ordered payments for tests he had demanded, though the court had insisted he do so. Montagu had stolen all of Wendy&#8217;s property, evidently selling her family heirlooms and jewelry. Wendy has received none of her possessions. All Montagu offered to give her were some old clothes.</p>
<p>Making Wendy disappear must finally have occurred to him as a solution to his problem. Fortunately for her, the individual Montagu asked to carry out the act, who was not psychopathic, called her and warned her what had been offered him. Her call to local detectives made this course too risky for Montagu to pursue.</p>
<p>Montagu had attempted to hide his assets and bank accounts. These had been discovered through subpoena, including one account holding nearly one millions dollars. He was confronted with the records on the stand and still tried to lie his way out, claiming it could not be his account.</p>
<p>Montagu left the area, never paying the court ordered support for his children or alimony. The court proved entirely unable to cope with someone for whom deceit was natural and who never paid his bills.</p>
<p>Normal people follow the rules. Psychopaths ignore them.</p>
<p><strong>Charges of Bigamy are proved.</strong></p>
<p>Two years after their divorce was over, 2009, evidently hoping the monies paid to the children would be directed to him by the Trust if his children were known to be illegitimate, he so informed the Trustees.</p>
<p>The Trustees were forced to stop the payments to the children, made on their behalf as beneficiaries, which had made up for the support not received by their father. After short consideration the Trustees filed a law suit, intended to clarify and affirm their wish to continue payments, not allowed under existing law.</p>
<p>The law suit was filed in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division and heard on July 19<sup>th</sup> 2011. The Trustees could restart payments to the straitened family. In the immediate aftermath a spate of articles hit papers across the world, naming Montagu as a bigamist, which examination of the existing documents and testimony had proven him to be.</p>
<p>Proof means nothing to a psychopath. Realizing the public relations disaster he had wrought, Montagu began to whine, asking for someone to prove someone else was responsible.</p>
<p>With the negative weight of the world opinion directed at him, not a shred of shame or contrition surfaced. Consideration for what his children had suffered, what he had done to his former wife, were ignored. The fact he was also proven to have committed massive fraud against his former wife, he also ignored, focusing only on himself.</p>
<p>His only interaction with his children is limited to calling them up to slander their mother and make demands. This reached a high, or low point, when he called his 12 year old daughter, Ashley, to describe pictures he had taken of her mother, clearly asleep in her bed unclothed. He told his daughter he had arranged to sell these to a porn site online. The taped message exists and will soon be back up online.</p>
<p>Whatever happens is always blamed on someone else. Bringing it full circle, this was true of his childhood and, as you read <a href="http://www.thedukeanddoxieofmanchester.info/p/articles.html" target="_blank">articles </a>written about him over his life time, you see this has been  consistent.  He shows no sense of shame, no empathy, no compassion.</p>
<p><a href="http://wn.com/Margaret_McMurdo" target="_blank">Judge Margaret McMurdo</a>, before whom Montagu appeared in Australia for stealing and selling rental cars in 1991, advised him to continue his psychiatric care,  &#8220;You need it,&#8221; she commented.   It has been noted by others in the legal profession he lives in a fantasy world and does not relate to reality.  The court was unable to cope with Montagu, releasing him to prey again, even though by 1991 there was a solid record of his crimes.</p>
<p><strong>The Direction Forward – A Solution</strong></p>
<p>During the 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s psychiatry believed psychopaths could be &#8216;cured.&#8217;  This hopeful assessment has now been largely abandoned, due to the insights gained through the work of Robert Hare, Ph.D., who has demonstrated the fact psychopaths receiving counseling benefit, but only by becoming more effective psychopaths.</p>
<p>It is time we focused on the source of the problem and, in cooperation with reform movements, began taking psychopaths into account.</p>
<p>Studying the history of Alexander, Duke of Manchester, provides evidentiary proof of the inability of courts on three continents to cope with the extreme likelihood he would, upon release, again look for unwitting victims. The number of Montagu&#8217;s victims doubtless number in the hundreds. As tragic as this is, it cannot be compared to the disastrous outcome from psychopaths who infest our institutions, converting for their own profit. Millions of Americans are, today, their victims. This is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>We must stop the psychopathic from participation, where a conscience and empathy are essential. Those areas are government, corporations with government contracts, our courts, our schools, and all entities funded by or in contractual relationships with government.</p>
<p>The Hare test for psychopathy, given by a qualified and trained professional is very reliable, remarkably so, when used by non-law enforcement. Hare expressed reservations at having it used more widely and, there are indications this might prove to be the case, according to an article, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/26/136619689/can-a-test-really-tell-whos-a-psychopath" target="_blank"><em>Can A Test Really Tell Who&#8217;s A Psychopath?</em></a> by <a href="http://www.npr.org/people/90889243/alix-spiegel" target="_blank">Alix Spiegel</a> appearing on NPR. But the problem arises from tests given by individuals, who though trained, are being paid by parties with a vested interest in a specific outcome. If tests are given blind, with no information provided to the person administering the test, this would not be an issue.</p>
<p>Hare himself has suggested it be used for those in government, corporations, courts, including attorneys, and in law enforcement. This would be given upon application for employment or, now to continue employment.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need legislation to enact this measure. Before voting for candidates, we demand they be tested,in effect, certified non-psychopathic, a kind of Honesty Bond. Some corporations will willingly test their officers and upper level employees. We buy from them, boycotting all others.</p>
<p>Ordinary corruption, we can handle.</p>
<p>A Note:</p>
<p>One week from today is Easter, the yearly celebration of the resurrection of Christ, a man who exemplifies Love. Eerily, the psychopathic exemplify the anti-Christ. Devoid of conscience and compassion, psychopaths share the characteristics of the devil, doing evil for evil&#8217;s sake. As I considered this I felt a chill run across my back.</p>
<p>Many have wondered when the Anti-Christ, long predicted, would be known. Many individuals and institutions have been suggested in this role. The threat represented by the anti-Christ seemed to come from all around us but be no place specific.</p>
<p>A threat spread among us would have that effect. Not knowing, we could not see, looking into faced that seem all too human.</p>
<p><em>Psychopaths, they do evil for evil&#8217;s sake.</em></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/beckhagee3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/beckhagee2.jpg" alt="" /></a>I have written several articles voicing concern over the Christian Right (CR) uniting with leaders in the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) for the purpose of fighting the culture war.  Other Christian bloggers are concerned as well and have been asking valid questions, such as why the CR chooses to involve themselves with these fringe groups.  As of this date we’re still in the dark.  So I’ll toss out the question again: Why do Christian leaders, pastors, and luminaries choose to unite with what Jesus referred to as “ravenous wolves”?</p>
<p>In my article series <a href="http://www.worldviewweekend.com/worldview-times/article.php?articleid=7200" target="_blank">The Religious Right uniting with Religious Renegades</a> I expressed alarm over some or our Christian leader’s decision to attend Gov. Rick Perry’s <em>The Response: A call to prayer</em>.  Many evangelicals were distressed that respected leaders would be standing shoulder to shoulder with folks who are associated with fringe groups such as the <a href="http://emailbrigade.com/307.html" target="_blank">New Apostolic Reformation</a>(NAR), the <a href="http://herescope.blogspot.com/2008/09/ihop-latter-rain.html" target="_blank">International House of Prayer</a> (IHOP) and the <a href="http://emailbrigade.com/306.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Word of Faith</span></a> (WoF).  These groups hold many of the same unbiblical beliefs such as “positive confession.”</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8216;Positive Confession&#8217;, a movement that came to popular acclaim through supposedly good fruit such as healing, has revealed its true nature as something more like a cult, with extremes of belief that bring the Name of the Lord into disrepute. The roots of Word of Faith doctrine are firmly planted in the soil of the metaphysical cults.&#8221; </em>(Cross + Word, 1997)</p>
<p>For several weeks before <em>The Response</em> many CR leaders who weren’t on board with the rally warned their brothers and sisters who were endorsing it that if they went to Perry’s prayer rally they’d be joining forces with false teachers and heretics.  But their warnings went unheeded by many.  A case in point would seem to be Joel Rosenberg.</p>
<p>On August 5, Joel posted his reasons for attending <em>The Response</em> (<a href="http://flashtrafficblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/a-call-to-prayer-fasting-for-our-country-the-politicians-dont-have-any-answers-but-where-is-the-church/" target="_blank">here</a>).  He later posted a glowing report of his experience (<a href="http://flashtrafficblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/07/we-need-another-dunkirk-30000-turn-out-to-pray-fast-for-america-and-israel/" target="_blank">here</a>). From where I stand it appears he chose to shut his ears to friends and fans that urged him not to lend his good name to an event that included IHOP-Kansas City on the leadership team.  Here’s what Joel <a href="http://flashtrafficblog.wordpress.com/2011/08/07/we-need-another-dunkirk-30000-turn-out-to-pray-fast-for-america-and-israel/" target="_blank">wrote on his blog</a>:</p>
<p><em>“The Response” was no ordinary prayer meeting. Personally, I’ve never been to anything like it, and I was blessed by every minute of it. There were no political speeches. No entrance fees. No offering. No fund-raising <wbr>appeal. No merchandise sold. No light show. No entertainment of any kind. This was simply seven straight hours of prayer and fasting, heartfelt contrition and repentance, Bible reading from the Book of Joel and many other Scriptures, and wonderful worship – both modern praise songs and beloved hymns — with every generation represented along with so many races and ethnic backgrounds. Let’s do more of this.</wbr></em></p>
<p>About those who urged him not to participate he said:</p>
<p><em>Some evangelicals were critical of “The Response.” They urged people not to attend because they have serious and fundamental theological differences with some of those involved in the event. A few emailed me and urged me not to participate. I heard those concerns and I have strong disagreements with some of the participants, too. But the truth is the vast majority of organizers and participants of this prayer meeting were theologically, morally and ethically solid evangelical, Bible believing followers of Jesus Christ. They included some trusted friends and allies that I have worked with over the years like Dr. James Dobson and Shirley Dobson, Vonette Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, Pastor Greg Matte of Houston’s First Baptist, Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America, Don Wildmon of the American Family Association, among others. Such men and women see the grave crises facing our country. They believe and faithfully teach that the Bible offers the only answers. Together with the governor of an important state, they called the country to pray based on the Scriptures. And many — including the media — paid attention.</em></p>
<p>Three things.  (1) A <strong>large number</strong> of organizers and endorsers were NAR/IHOP leaders.  (2) <em>Bible believing follower of Jesus Christ</em> Tony Perkins has partnered with the NAR in the past (see links below).   Tony knows how dangerous these groups are so why does he continue to partner with them?  (3) The AFA sponsored and organized the rally so most likely <em>Bible believing follower of Jesus Christ</em> Don Wildmon chose the leadership team.  Don knew well in advance that some were apostate IHOP-KC leaders. Is Wildmon (and other <em>Bible believing followers of Jesus Christ </em>in AFA’s leadership) so results oriented that it doesn’t matter to them who they unite with as long as they get the results they want?  Another question for AFA is: Do some of its leaders share the NAR’s unbiblical <a href="http://www.worldviewweekend.com/worldview-times/article.php?articleid=7244" target="_blank">Dominionist</a> beliefs?</p>
<p>Last year Joel Rosenberg was invited to speak at the 2010 Break Forth Canada Conference and promoted the conference positively on his blog.  He shared a platform with those in the contemplative/emerging/new spirituality camp including New Age sympathizer and Emergent guru <a href="http://www.deceptioninthechurch.com/leonardsweetquotes.html" target="_blank">Leonard Sweet</a> and universalist <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIBy0Bkk1ks" target="_blank">William P. Young</a>.  When people wrote to voice their distress over his involvement in the conference, here’s how Joel responded:</p>
<p><em>The reason I am attending is because it is the largest Christian conference in Canada (some 15,000 are expected to attend), I believe the Holy Spirit wanted me to accept the invitation, and I’m not ready to concede such ground to those who are peddling false teaching. I’ve been asked to come and teach the Word of God and preach the gospel and that’s what I intend to do. I can’t explain why Young, for example, was invited. But why cede the entire stage to him? Moreover, at this critical juncture, I hope to explain why the God of the Bible loves Israel so much and why He wants us to help mobilize a global movement of true believers to stand with Israel while so much of the rest of the world turns against her. Thanks for your concerns. I would appreciate your prayers. God bless you. </em>(<a href="http://flashtrafficblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/exclusive-israeli-vice-prime-minister-tells-evangelicals-u-s-policy-of-engagement-with-iran-perceived-by-radicals-as-weakness/" target="_blank">Online source</a>)</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit wanted him to accept the invitation?  That doesn’t seem very likely in light of what the Bible says:</p>
<p><em>But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. </em><em>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’ table, and of the table of devils. </em>(I Corinthians 10:20-21)</p>
<p>Please understand that I’m not picking on Joel Rosenberg.  To be fair, he’s not alone.  Many Christians share a platform with men and women they have theological differences with.  I’ve singled Joel out because the reasons he gave for doing it don’t really stand up.  It stands to reason that if he’s invited to “teach and preach the gospel” the other speakers are invited for the same reason.  At the Canada conference attendees were exposed to Sweet’s and Young’s heresy!  Moreover, they were exposed to a false gospel.</p>
<p>In a previous article I pointed out that some of <em>The Response</em> organizers and participants were also involved in the <a href="http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/news/26616-christian-and-conservative-leaders-call-for-mayday-prayer-" target="_blank">May Day 2010: A cry to God for a Nation in Distress</a> put on by NAR “prophet” Cindy Jacobs of General’s International.  <a href="http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2010/04/27/may-day-prayer-alert-as-james-dobson-says-were-in.aspx" target="_blank">James Dobson promoted the event</a> and recorded an audio message encouraging people to attend. Several CR leaders who attended both prayer rallies have been guests on Mormon Glenn Beck’s radio and TV broadcast.  Glenn’s guests have included Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission, mega church Pastor Jim Garlow, David Barton of Wall Builders, televangelist James Robison (he didn’t attend <em>The Response</em>), even Joel Rosenberg.  Rev. John Hagee was one of the only pastors to pray solo at <em>The Response</em>.  Hagee chose Glenn Beck as a keynote speaker for “<a href="http://www.glennbeck.com/2011/05/04/glenn-to-keynote-christians-united-for-israel/" target="_blank">A Night to Honor Israel</a>.”  CR leader Gary Bauer, President of Our American Values and a board member of Hagee’s Christians United for Israel, also spoke.   For readers who are unfamiliar with Rev. Hagee, he’s the founder and pastor of San Antonio-based Cornerstone Church which is one of America’s largest WoF churches (prosperity gospel, name it and claim it).  According to G. Richard Fisher, Hagee is a false teacher:</p>
<p><em>[C]areful evaluation of the teachings of Hagee…reveals false teaching and a defective view of a basic and essential issue regarding salvation and the Gospel. Hagee preaches another way of salvation for the Jew, which is in direct violation of Paul’s warnings in Galatians 1:6-9</em>.  (<a href="http://www.pfo.org/jonhagee.htm" target="_blank">Online source</a>)</p>
<p>Some of you are probably thinking, “Hagee’s books line the shelves of Christian bookstores and sell like hotcakes so he must be a solid Christian.”</p>
<p>It ain’t necessarily so:</p>
<p><em>“How a book sells is not an indication of its merit. The American public has a seemingly bottomless appetite for nonsense, as evidenced by the countless tomes about astrology, aliens from outer space, quack diets, and UFOs that have regularly graced best-seller lists over the years. Some books that sold millions have later been exposed as hoaxes. A slot on the best-seller list tells you exactly one thing about a book: that a lot of people bought it.”<sup> </sup></em>(<a href="http://www.pfo.org/jonhagee.htm" target="_blank">Online source</a>)</p>
<p>The point I’m making is that even discerning Christians are finding it difficult to ferret out true believers from those that have a very different agenda.</p>
<p>I have one final question for CR leaders:  Do you not know that:</p>
<p><em>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, <strong>receive him not into your house</strong>, <strong>neither bid him God speed: For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds</strong>. </em>(2 John 9-11)<em> </em>(Bold mine)</p>
<p>The NAR’s aberrant doctrines and beliefs are causing division in the Church.  In Romans 16:17-18, Paul writes,</p>
<p><em>Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.</em> (See also <a href="http://kingjbible.com/philippians/3.htm" target="_blank">Philippians 3:17-19</a>).</p>
<p>CR leaders must be obedient to God’s Word and stop uniting with those who are deceiving the hearts of the simple and do as Paul says: Mark them!</p>
<p>I’ll leave you with an excerpt from a 1988 message given by the late Dr. Walter Martin <em>Warning of the Word Faith Movement’s teaching to the church:</em></p>
<p><em>Jesus said there will come men who will speak claiming their authority is from me…There will come men who will speak in my Name. That is, I am supposedly saying this to you – that’s a very important phrase!  They are going to come and say I&#8217;m speaking to you in my Name, they will work miracles in my Name, they will cast out devils…they will prophesy and preach. But when I meet them I will say, leave me, I never knew you, workers of iniquity!</em></p>
<p><em>Why? Because they use His authority and His Name because the power was in Jesus’ Name, or in Jesus&#8217; authority, not in them. And God honored the Name of His Son. And they took that as a means of teaching their own false doctrines and false prophecies and because of that they corrupted the faith of the church. But inwardly, spiritually, they really roooaaar! And if you don&#8217;t know fleece from fur, you’re dinner, dumb dumb.  And the only way you can know fleece from fur is to know how to test them. And you don&#8217;t test them by Walter Martin or by Norman Geisler, as good as the apologist and defenders of Christianity might be and as much as you trust them. You don&#8217;t test them by other people.  You test them by Scripture. Then if your fidelity is the Scripture, and your allegiance is the Scripture, you reject them! But, says Paul, in the last days men are going to be drawn away by false teachers and prophets in the Church speaking in the Name of Jesus and you’re not going to test them.  You’re going to go along with them. <strong>And they’re gonna fragment and divide the Church because you won’t test them.  Well, it’s about time we test them.</strong> </em>(Note: For clarity I took the liberty of making a few changes.  The original quote is on<a href="http://www.letusreason.org/Wf26.htm" target="_blank">Let Us Reason Ministries</a>.)</p>

			<p>The catastrophic disaster that swept Japan into a new stone age is truly an earth-shattering milestone. Worldwide grief and empathy is real and deserved. If this occurrence were only, a script out of a Godzilla B movie, or just lyrics from a <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/ika/go+godzilla+go_20204671.html">ringtone song</a>, the hurt or the aftermath would not be so horrible.</p>
<p><em>you cannot run in any direction</em></p>
<p><em> no place to hide ain&#8217;t got no protection</em></p>
<p><em>it can be sorrow, blood, and destruction</em></p>
<p><em>but it can give you incredible emotion</em></p>
<p>How does one explain this calamity? Is it a mysterious act of God, or is it modern technology run amuck?</p>
<p>As long as the earthquake was not triggered by <a href="http://www.ufo-blogger.com/2011/03/japan-earthquake-tsunami-haarp.html">HAARP</a> like intentions, the wall of tsunami destruction is part of the risk of residing in the active zone of the ring of fire. The meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant complex is far less than a matter of fate. Is nuclear electric generation just too risky to chance or can humanity trust upon technology to institute new safeguards for future developments?</p>
<p>The answer usually depends upon one’s viewpoint on the Global Warming theory. Those who worship at the altar of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> love their environmentalist adoration. While nuclear power is CO2 friendly, the radiation peril is too threatening to accept. The half-life of these zealots often reflects the mental capacity of Homer Simpson and the appearance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycephaly">Polycephaly</a> mutant beasts of burden.</p>
<p>Those who see Global Warming as a manageable problem often place great reliance on scientific progress in solving and overcoming environmental challenges. These people normally populate the engineering professions and research laboratories that spawn the next evolution of made-made technological marvels.</p>
<p>Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger write in the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704312504575618972157288244.html">WSJ</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is a better way. Nations should focus on lowering the cost of clean energy, not raising the cost of fossil energy. The goal? Make clean energy cheap enough to become a viable option for poor as well as rich nations. Until that happens, emissions will continue to rise, and no effort to regulate carbon can succeed.</p>
<p>How do we accomplish that? Stop subsidizing old technology that will never compete with fossil fuels and create incentives for innovation. Along with ramping up support for research, governments should buy cutting-edge clean-energy technologies, prove them—and then give away the intellectual property, so others can improve on it&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there are those who view Global Warming as a hoax and a political grab for further consolidation of a centralized society under the control of a corporate/state oligarchy. The evidence is on their side. Exhibit 1, <a href="http://citizenpoweralliance.wordpress.com/industrial-wind-and-the-wall-street-cap-and-trade-fraud/">Cap and Trade</a> proposals demonstrate the total disconnects for meeting the energy needs of a modern society.</p>
<p>The high and mighty culture would like you to believe that nuclear energy from civilian reactors is a centerpiece of scientific superiority over nature. Well, there are a few problems with this conclusion. Since the nuclear genie escaped from the bottle, the myth that science is equal to God has run wild for decades. At the risk of condemnation by the scientific inquisition court, is the world a better place to live under the canopy of a mushroom cloud?</p>

<p>Admittedly, the symbol of this age is the face of existential oblivion, dressed up in space suits on life support. The fallout from the Fukushima reactor disaster will last longer than the radioactive dust that contaminates the ecosphere. At question is not solely the safety of the nuclear electrical generation process, but the notion of pushing the limits of human endeavors that endanger the survival of the species itself.</p>
<p>A favorite and world-class curmudgeon, Fred Reed, proposes a valid and alternative conclusion to the insanity in, <a href="http://mensnewsdaily.com/x/2011/03/08/why-we-need-an-asteroid-strike/">Why We Need an Asteroid Strike</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I figure that what we need is to tear the whole sorry system down and see what comes next. The best hope is that a patriot will learn how to impel some unused interplanetary object, Phobos or Deimos or Ganymede maybe, into Washington at ninety percent of the speed of light. This would eliminate the teachers unions, the Pentagon, AIPAC, Fox News, Langley, the Washington Post, lobbies, and my mother-in-law. Cockroaches would doubtless survive, that being what they do best, and evolve into a civilization less degraded than ours, briefly&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/nuclear-power-cartoon.jpg" alt="nuclear-museum.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="0" align="Left" /></p>
<p>The disinformation coming out of Japan from official circles all qualifies as radiation poisoning. The Green revolution is nothing more than a denial cult of blind faith in the power of mankind to destroy society with all the best intentions that the Tempter can muster. Wind and solar are not candidates for prime time. Renewable deficiencies are well documented by <a href="http://www.windaction.org/">IWA</a> and <a href="http://citizenpoweralliance.org/">CPA</a> and suggest that only a &#8220;true believer&#8221; would accept the prevarications of the anti fossil fuel lobby. Sentencing clean coal to the pits of a dark hole verges on calling for the release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</a> from prison.</p>
<p>After the Japanese disaster, the nuclear industry needs an alternative to the current reactors, now perceived as unsafe. <a href="http://thisweekinnuclear.com/?p=1193">John Wheeler</a> in This Week in Nuclear, evaluates the safety of small nuclear reactors</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These smaller reactors contain less nuclear fuel. This smaller amount of fuel (with passive cooling I’ll mention in a minute) slows down the progression of reactor accidents. This slower progression gives operators more time to take action to keep the reactor cool. Where operators in large reactors have minutes or hours to react to events, operators of SMRs may have hours or even days. This means the chance of a reactor damaging accident is very, very remote.</p>
<p>Even better, most SMRs are small enough that they cannot over heat and melt down. They get all the cooling they need from air circulating around the reactor. This is a big deal because if SMRs can’t melt down, then they can’t release radioactive gas that would pose a risk to the public. Again, this means the need for external emergency actions is virtually eliminated.</p>
<p>Also, some SMRs are not water cooled; they use gas, liquid salt, or liquid metal coolants that operate at low pressures. This lower operating pressure means that if radioactive gases build up inside the containment building there is less pressure to push the gas out and into the air. If there is no pressure to push radioactive gas into the environment and all of it stays inside the plant, then it poses no risk to the public.</p>
<p>SMRs are small enough to be built underground&#8221;.
</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;So called&#8221; miracles of science often become the thimerosal babies of tomorrow. Likewise, the politics of nuclear energy are riddled in contradictions. <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/energy/articles/2009/03/16/lessons-from-the-yucca-mountain-nuclear-waste-storage-debate">Lessons from the Yucca Mountain</a> Nuclear Waste Storage Debate, points out the ineptness of domestic energy policy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over the past decade, more than 7,000 shipments of radioactive nuclear waste have been sent, without any problem, to a government repository in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>This crucial repository is not the ill-fated Yucca Mountain, the Nevada site that has been steeped in controversy since Congress selected it 22 years ago to store the country&#8217;s civilian nuclear waste. Yucca Mountain, in fact, has gotten so bogged down in legal and political fights that <a href="http://www.usnews.com/sections/news/obama/index.html">President Barack Obama</a>, in his new budget, is proposing to eliminate almost all of its funding and explore &#8220;alternatives,&#8221; raising serious questions about how the United States will resolve its nuclear waste problems—and, for that matter, whether the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/stimulus/2009/01/07/keen-for-a-revival-the-nuclear-industry-eyes-the-stimulus-package.html">nuclear industry</a> will be able to grow in coming decades.The functioning repository is located in Carlsbad, N.M., and it may hold some useful answers. Since opening in 1999, it has received more than 60,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste from the country&#8217;s nuclear defense facilities. Experts say its success offers valuable clues about how Washington can learn from the mistakes made at Yucca Mountain to find a lasting waste solution&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<div>If the nuclear industry is targeted for demise, only natural gas or coal can produce the needed electric energy on a scale to keep the economy viable. The alternative of rolling brown outs are a favored tactic used by such titans of business ethics as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis">Enron</a>. Welcome to the era of designed shortages and inflated costs.</div>
<p>The risks of hydrofracking techniques to extract natural gas are very real and profound. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/us/27gas.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1&amp;hp">New York Times</a> reports on contamination of the water table.</p>
<blockquote><p>¶More than 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater was produced by Pennsylvania wells over the past three years, far more than has been previously disclosed. Most of this water — enough to cover Manhattan in three inches — was sent to treatment plants not equipped to remove many of the toxic materials in drilling waste.</p>
<p>¶At least 12 sewage treatment plants in three states accepted gas industry wastewater and discharged waste that was only partly treated into rivers, lakes and streams.</p>
<p>¶Of more than 179 wells producing wastewater with high levels of radiation, at least 116 reported levels of radium or other radioactive materials 100 times as high as the levels set by federal drinking-water standards. At least 15 wells produced wastewater carrying more than 1,000 times the amount of radioactive elements considered acceptable.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Weird science is a serious problem, but factitious global warming is a well-designed dose of irradiation that attacks the mush of feeble-minded morons who want to be &#8220;PC&#8221; in a culture gone mad. If you surrender to the totalitarian collectivists, you are accepting the global gulag. Clean coal offers the best economic and safe energy future for an independent America. Synthetic fuel conversion from coal into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel">synfuel</a> is the best way to reduce the addiction of imported oil.</p>

<p>Apollo 10&#8242;s amazing encounter with a VERY bizarre anomaly while behind  the far side of the Moon. This segment will give you an up-close look at  an astounding audio transcript from the Apollo 10 mission that has  never before been publicly analyzed &#8211; and that NASA and the Apollo 10  astronauts to this day still refuse to talk about.</p>
<p>You will follow Tom Stafford, Gene Cernan, and John Young as they become  only the second crew in history to journey behind the lunar far side.  During this period of &#8220;LOS&#8221; (Loss Of Signal), the astronauts encounter  something truly incredible &#8211; they discover MUSIC behind the Moon!</p>
<p><strong>NASA&#8217;s Alien Anomalies caught on film &#8211; A compilation of stunning UFO footage from NASA&#8217;s archives&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>This compilation includes many of my favorite NASA UFO  encounters/sightings that I have archived over the years. All of these  examples (with the exception of the second-to-last one) were captured on  film by NASA astronauts or Russian Cosmonauts over the past  half-century &#8211; showing many amazing examples from different eras &#8211;  Gemini, Apollo, Apollo/Soyuz Test Project, Skylab, STS, the ISS, plus a  couple Russian-source additions from their unmanned Zond and Mir Space  Station programs as well thrown in to round things out.</p>
<p>The second last example is the only one in the compilation that features  footage that was not taken in space and is not official-source (NASA or  Soviet/Russian Space Agency). That clip shows an LTP (Lunar Transient  Phenomenon) event captured through a camera connected to the eyepiece of  a terrestrial-based telescope that luckily was being focused on the  Moon at the time. In this case, the LTP manifests as an object  transiting across the face of the lunar disc. Many thanks to amateur  astronomer Alberto Mayer of Italy for doing a wonderful job of filming  this stunning event (and for stacking the footage for us all to see).</p>
<p>While the examples you will see here captured on film can all be  &#8220;officially&#8221; classified as &#8220;unidentified&#8221; objects, that absolutely does  NOT mean that NASA, the DoD, and certain elements within the scientific  community worldwide are completely in the dark as to what these things  you are seeing are. Make no mistake: The Powers That Be are indeed aware  of far more about our mysterious Universe than they are ever willing to  admit to us. We, the plebeian masses of this planet, are being held in a  state of enforced ignorance, deemed not worthy of knowing the full  truth by those who are REALLY &#8220;running the show&#8221; down here on Earth. As  this video shows over and over again however, there are indeed snippets  of that amazing truth that have been left scattered about the official  government archives over the decades, there for us to find so we may  begin to educate ourselves about what is the most monumental coverup in  human history &#8211; where the only thing more incredible than the lies is  the truth!</p>

<p>Lady Gaga stole the Grammy limelight on Sunday by arriving encased in  a giant egg, and crawling out of it to perform her new single &#8220;Born  This Way&#8221;.</p>
<p>Gaga, 24, declared in a Twitter message that she was &#8220;in incubation&#8221; for  her live appearance. Aides said she had spent three hours crouched  inside the egg with an oxygen mask ahead of her arrival.</p>

Borne aloft by attendants dressed in scanty gold-colored garb, the egg  was the latest in a series of stunts by the performance artist and  singer. In September, she wore a headline-grabbing dress made entirely  of raw meat that she wore to the MTV Music Video Awards.</p>
<p>Onstage on Sunday, she crawled out of the egg dressed in yellow and sporting what appeared to be pointed shoulder implants.</p>

<p>
Away from the Grammy ceremony in Los Angeles, the singer made headlines  by saying in a pre-recorded TV interview that she uses marijuana and  whiskey to help write her songs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;(I) drink a lot of whiskey and I smoke weed when I write. And I don’t  do it a lot because it’s not good for my voice,&#8221; the singer told TV news  show &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t want to encourage kids to do drugs&#8230;.And I don’t lie. I’m not a  liar. I built good will with my fans. They know who I am. And I’m just  like them in so many ways,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Halfway through the Grammy ceremony, Gaga had won three of the six  awards she had been nominated for &#8212; one for her album &#8220;The Fame  Monster&#8221; and two for her song &#8220;Bad Romance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had this dream when I was really young that I could be whoever I wanted to be,&#8221; she said in her acceptance speech.</p>
<p>The singer, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, told &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; there was always a point to her outrageous outfits.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s nothing that I’ve ever put on my body that I didn’t understand  where it came from, the reference of it, who inspired it. There’s always  some sort of a story or a concept that I’m telling,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The egg is a pagan symbol of the rebirth of the Earth in celebrations of  spring and was adopted by early Christians as a symbol of the  resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>According to this tradition, after the Ascension of Jesus, Mary  Magdalene went to the Emperor of Rome and greeted him with &#8220;Christ has  risen,&#8221; whereupon he pointed to an egg on his table and stated, &#8220;Christ  has no more risen than that egg is red.&#8221; After making this statement it  is said the egg immediately turned blood red.</p>

<p><strong>Mukat and Tamaoit: Cahuilla Legend of Twin Creators</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning there was no earth or sky but only the dense darkness  of space. Darkness was everywhere and yet it seemed alive, for out of it  came sound, darkest sound. And then appeared a flash of light which cut  the depths of space, leaving behind the froth of the mother substance.  This substance lay like the white of egg upon the stomach of darkness,  which resembled a spider’s web. Three times the substance strove to give  birth, and in the third attempt it was pierced with a lightning ray.  Being thus penetrated, it slowly grew and in time produced two great  eggs. When the eggs began to hatch they broke first at the top,  revealing two heads, then shoulders, hips, knees, ankles and toes. Mukat  and Tamaoit emerged. They were twins and fully grown at birth. Mukat  remained upon the newly created earth and begat life out of his essence.  Tamaoit disappeared beneath the earth, leaving only mountains to  commemorate his birth.</p>
<p>This, in paraphrase, is what old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahuilla_people" target="_blank">Cahuilla Indians</a> told the young about the creation of the world. Like multicolored  skeins gathered around the nesting place of the cosmos, all cultures  have woven their legends of the mystery of creation. Perhaps one of the  most powerful symbols of this mystery is <strong>the egg</strong>.</p>
<p>To ancients in all lands, the egg was the symbol of generation and  immortality. In Scandinavia and Russia clay eggs were put in tombs to  ensure life after death. A similar idea was signified in ancient Egypt  by the winged egg floating above the mummy, carrying the soul to another  birth. The Chinese believed that the first archetypal man sprang from  an egg dropped by Tien, a great bird. The alchemists spoke of the  philosophical egg which combined all the elements of life, the container  of thought and matter. The Greeks thought of the egg as the seven-fold  vault of space, a symbol originally compounded in the dual septenary  planes of the Cosmic Egg of Hindu tradition.</p>
<p>Reverence for the egg is evoked by its form as well as by its  mystery. Its elliptical form describes the movement of heavenly bodies  and of the earth itself. It describes the sphere of light that surrounds  all living things. It is in the oviform that the potency of spirit in  matter manifests. The Katakopanisad teaches that in the Spiritual Egg,  Purusha or Divine Spirit stands before primordial matter and from their  union springs the great Soul of the World.</p>
<p>Often connected with the Spiritual Egg is the idea of a sacred bird  that drops the Egg into the waters of space or chaos. Just as there is  the Chinese Tien-bird, so there is Seb, the Egyptian chicken who gave  birth to the egg of Ra, the sun. In Hindu tradition the ’Swan of  Eternity’ lays a ’Golden Egg’ at the beginning of each Mahamanvantara.  This Swan is the sacred Kalahansa, the Word. Its egg is the Word made  manifest. The raven is sometimes connected with the egg-symbol of  generation and primeval wisdom as illustrated by Odin’s black ravens  fluttering around the Goddess Saga or Noah releasing the black raven  after the great deluge or pralaya. The Omaha Indians describe a  beginning when all things were in the mind of Wakonda. There was naught  but silence, nothing was joined, nothing stirred. Within this darkness  was the germ of the maker and moulder, the hurler, the Bird Serpent.  Then rose up Hurakan, the night wind; the great black raven dropped its  egg upon the waters. Beneath the raven’s sheltering wings, the mothers  and fathers to be slept within the egg.</p>
<p>On every level the egg eternally regenerates. Virginal, it embodies  the quality of eggness, the power of becoming developed through  fecundation. The human egg is the female reproductive element.<br />

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/pagans03.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/pagans02.jpg" alt="pagans" /></a>More than eighty years ago, America began moving away from its&#8217; founding Biblical-based worldview to what President Calvin Coolidge identified as &#8220;pagan materialism.&#8221;  Fearing for the future of our Constitutional Republic he said in a speech delivered on the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, July 5, 1926:</p>
<p>&#8220;Democracy is Christ&#8217;s government in church and state,&#8221; said Coolidge as he quoted John Wise (1710).  &#8220;Here was the doctrine of equality, popular sovereignty, and the substance of the theory of inalienable rights&#8230;.When we take all these circumstances into consideration, it is but natural that the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence should open with a reference to Nature&#8217;s God and should close&#8230;with an appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world and an assertion of a firm reliance on Divine Providence&#8230;In its main feature the Declaration of Independence is a great spiritual document.  Equality, liberty, popular sovereignty, the rights of man&#8212;these are not elements which we can see and touch.  They are ideals. They have their source and roots in the religious convictions.  They belong to the unseen world. &#8221;   (Backfired: A Nation Born for Religious Tolerance No Longer Tolerates Religion, William J. Federer, pp. 270-271)</p>
<p>The &#8220;pagan materialism&#8221; Coolidge warned against is evolutionary materialist scientism, also known as Secular Humanism.  Materialism is neither new nor scientific.   In the main, it is ancient Epicurean Atomism revamped and dressed up as modern science.   Materialism teaches that all that exists is merely material or energy which is impersonal, totally neutral to any moral system or any interest in man as man. In this view, there is no basis for law, and no basis for man as unique and important.</p>
<p>Materialism is of the world view of monism which teaches that all that exists is &#8220;one self-creating, self-sufficient substance&#8221; which may be divine spirit (pantheism) or spiritless substance (materialism).<br />
Monism is held in common by materialism, pantheism, and spiritualism and dates back to pagan antiquity and was or is taught by all non-biblical thought systems from Buddhism to Epicureanism, Gnosticism and today&#8217;s New Age Cosmic Humanism.</p>
<p>Monism teaches that all things, including mankind, are merely diverse parts of the one-substance.   God is acceptable to this monistic frame of mind only if He is not something outside of and superior to the one-substance but one with it.  In other words, God must be dispersed throughout the whole substance.</p>
<p>In his book, &#8220;Utopia: The Perennial Heresy,&#8221; Thomas Molnar explains that evolution, whether Darwinian or a spiritual conception such as Teilhard&#8217;s idea, serves as an imaginary mechanism of perfection for both man and the one-substance:</p>
<p>&#8220;Through evolution the world substance becomes progressively pure, homogenous and perfect until the terminal point is reached&#8230;&#8221;  (p.235)   At that point, there is either a perfected non-spiritual substance (materialism) or a perfectly spiritualized substance (pantheism).  For utopians this means a heaven on earth ruled by perfected god-men.</p>
<p>In that materialism excludes the transcendent Creator, angels, demons, heaven, and hell it must also explain away man&#8217;s God-given individual spiritual endowments &#8211;soul, mind, free will, and conscience&#8211; attributes defined by the Founders as self-evident truths, for it is self-evidently true that all men  think, choose, and feel guilt.    In short, in denying the existence of God the Father and man&#8217;s supernaturally endowed attributes,  materialist scientism abolishes our unalienable rights, thereby making worthless both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that Coolidge warned against pagan materialism:</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless the faith of the American in these religious (Biblical) convictions is to endure, the principles of our Declaration will perish. We cannot continue to enjoy the result if we neglect and abandon the cause.&#8221;  (ibid, p. 265; emphasis added)</p>
<p>Despite the valiant efforts of Pres. Coolidge and many other men of integrity to edify Americans, the consensus in contemporary America and the western world is no longer Biblical but pagan, that is, Cosmic Humanism (Eastern/Gnostic occult New Age) and Secular Humanism (materialist scientism).</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means that through the goetia (black magic) of  Darwinian transformism &#8220;we the people&#8221; have been speculatively reduced to aggregates of matter, subsumed into the &#8220;one substance&#8221; and now have solidarity (oneness) with apes, rocks, trees, fish, tumblebugs, pond scum, and dirt.   Individual salvation has become collective salvation, individual rights are now group rights,  male-female created distinctions have been melted down into androgyny, and monogamous marriage has become a sexual free-for-all.</p>
<p>Law, foreign affairs, taxation, politics, immigration, morality and all other important decisions are now decided by a small group of &#8220;elites,&#8221; many of whom are New Age spiritists led by spirit guides and Transcended Masters, and what they decide at any given moment is supposedly for the common good of society.  These all-powerful individuals are America&#8217;s Ruling Class, and in back of them, the U.N., NGOs,  and other powerful global organizations.</p>
<p><strong>The Return to Paganism</strong></p>
<p>C.S. Lewis  observed in The Abolition of Man (1947) that Cosmic and Secular Humanism  appeared in Western history in the heart of Christendom during the Renaissance.   The Renaissance reawakened a magic view of the world closely connected with  pagan Gnostic sectarianism, Eastern pantheism as well as alchemical-scientism.  Along with Eastern pantheism came spiritual evolution, reincarnation, karma and occultism, which means that evolutionary conceptions  existed long before Darwin.</p>
<p>Early on Lewis understood that Cosmic  and Secular Humanism  were merely two sides of the same revival of pagan monism. Thus he argued, Cosmic and Secular Humanism are not enemies in principle but rather cooperating philosophies united against the transcendent Creator, Christianity and Christian-based civilization.</p>
<p>Brooks Alexander also identifies both Cosmic and Secular Humanism as the two sides of pagan monism.   And because they are from the same root they tend to cross-pollinate and:</p>
<p>&#8220;mingle, producing a brood of offspring that exhibits the genetic heritage of its parents in a confused and confusing array.  Soon it becomes impossible to say whether a given movement, trend or school of thought is a secular impulse that has absorbed Eastern/occult values, or an Eastern/occult teaching that has dressed itself in secular language.&#8221;  (The Rise of Cosmic Humanism: What is Religion?&#8221; Brooks Alexander,  SCP Journal, 1981-82, p. 2)</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Ye Can Be As Gods&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The powerfully seductive Big Lie  underlies both Cosmic and Secular Humanism.   This thought is expressed openly in the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and  Dr. Beverly Galyean, leading exponent of occult New Age confluent education:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Buddhists and the Jains do not depend on God; but the whole force of their religion is directed to the great central truth in every religion: to evolve a God out of man.&#8221; (Inspired Talks, Ramakrishna Vivekananda Center, 1958, p. 218)</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we begin to see that we are all God, that we have the attributes of God, then, I think the whole purpose of human life is to reown the Godlikeness within us&#8230;So my whole view is very much based on that idea.&#8221;   (Galyean quoted by Francis Adeney, Educators Look East, Radix 12, No. 3, Nov-Dec. 1980, p. 21)</p>
<p>This same idea expressed in secular terms  such as self-realization and self-actualization (a term coined by Abraham Maslow) underlies many contemporary psychotherapies.</p>
<p>In carefully couched terms, the  &#8220;Humanist Manifesto&#8221; (1973) also declares autonomous man&#8217;s godhood:</p>
<p>&#8220;We affirm that moral values derive their source from human experience.  Ethics is autonomous and situational&#8230;life has meaning because we create and develop our futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conclusion of both Cosmic and Secular Humanism is the same: human beings can be as God and invent their own &#8220;ten commandments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another key point at which Cosmic and Secular Humanism intersect  is evolution.    Secular Humanism adopted the Gnostic myth of biological (Darwinian) evolution as an explanation both for the origin and development of life as well as for the perfecting of the one substance and mankind.  Cosmic Humanism springboards off of Darwinism into imaginary spiritual conceptions such as  Teilhard de Chardins&#8217;  idea.   The apostate French Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) taught that God emerges from matter.  According to him, this evolution of God from the world results in evolution becoming &#8220;conscious of itself&#8221; and  ultimately, in the transformation  of all matter into &#8220;Christ consciousness&#8221; or &#8220;pure spirit.&#8221; He called this final stage the &#8220;Omega Point&#8221; or &#8220;the cosmic Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>New Age  techniques to get in touch with the &#8220;Christ consciousness&#8221; include physical exercises, special diets (especially vegetarianism),  biofeedback, chanting, psychodrama, consciousness-raising strategies, hypnosis and self-hypnosis, centering, body disciplines and therapies such as hatha yoga and aikido as well as sensitivity groups and encounter groups, Zen, Tibetan Buddhism and transcendental meditation and yoga.    Former guru Rabindranath R. Maharaj, now a committed follower of Jesus Christ, describes his former transcendental meditation ritual and its&#8217; terrifying consequences:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing was more important than our daily transcendental meditation, the heart of Yoga, which Krishna advocated as the surest way to eternal Bliss.  But it could also be dangerous.  Frightening psychic experiences awaited the&#8230;meditator, similar to a bad trip on drugs.  Demons described in the Vedas had been known to take possession of some Yogis.  Kundalini power, said to be coiled like a serpent at the base of the spine, could produce ecstatic experiences when released in deep meditation&#8211;or&#8230;it could do great mental and bodily harm.  The line between ecstasy and horror was very fine&#8230;During daily meditation I began to have visions of psychedelic colors, to hear  unearthly music, and to visit exotic planets where the gods conversed with me, encouraging me to attain even higher states of consciousness.   Sometimes in my trance I encountered the same horrible demonic creatures&#8230;depicted by the images in Hindu, Buddhist, Shinto, and other religious temples.  It was a frightful experience, but the Brahmacharya explained that it was normal and urged me to pursue the quest for Self Realization.   At times I experienced a sense of mystical unity with the universe.  I was the universe, Lord of all, omnipotent, omnipresent.  My instructors were excited at this.  I was obviously a chosen vessel, destined for early success in the search for union with Brahman.  The Forces that had guided my father were now guiding me.&#8221;  (Death of a Guru, Rabindranath R. Maharaj, pp. 56-57)</p>
<p><strong>Dying Materialism Opens Door To Occult Forces</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Unless we are mistaken&#8230;the twentieth century&#8230;is to witness a gigantic conflict of spirits&#8230;More serious and fiercer than ever before, the conflict is between the old and the new worldview.&#8221;   Herman Bavinck, Christian theologian, 1901</p>
<p>Materialist scientism has always been utterly repugnant to more spiritually sensitive people.  With its&#8217; nihilism, mindless mechanistic universe, reductionism, moral anarchy and irrationalism, it has generated its own crisis of credibility. However,  as a universal alchemical-solvent that has broken down the West&#8217;s Biblical-based worldview, it has served to throw wide the door to equally irrational but far more dangerous occult New Age Cosmic Humanism, which as a spiritual force began to emerge in the United States around 1965.</p>
<p>By the mid-1980s,  a bright &#8220;new&#8221; spirituality began to seductively beckon demoralized, restless, narcissistic, consumerist Westerners.  Promising personal &#8220;spiritual&#8221; power, peace, unending pleasure, and oneness with the Divine, it enticingly whispers, &#8220;you can become god.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Marilyn Ferguson&#8217;s book, &#8220;The Aquarian Conspiracy,&#8221; she identifies the &#8220;new&#8221; spirituality as New Age and says that this movement of spirit is poised to radically transform our culture.  Western society is at a pivotal point, said Ferguson in reference to what she called the &#8220;Emergent Culture&#8221; of New Age.</p>
<p>Ferguson called it the Aquarian Conspiracy for two reasons.  First, astrology foretells the end of the Age of Pisces (the fish).  Astrologically the fish symbolizes the Christian Age, which is finally giving way to the New Age of Aquarius.  Second, she calls it a conspiracy in recognition of a spiritually-cohesive, vast interlocking-network of individuals, grassroots initiatives, and thousands upon thousands of formal New Age organizations at every level of society, from the lowest level to the highest global corridors of political, spiritual, and economic power that link this movement both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>As occult spirituality moved with great speed and force over and across post-Christian America, mainstream media took note and reported:</p>
<p>&#8220;Neopaganism Growing Quickly: Numbers Roughly Double Every 18 Months in United States, Canada, and Europe.&#8221;   Denver Post, June 26, 2008 (How Evil Works: Understanding and Overcoming the Destructive Forces that are Transforming America, David Kupelian, p. 115)</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorcery Sells, and the Young are Buying&#8221;   Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 10, 2007 (ibid)</p>
<p>&#8220;Wicca is Believed to be One of the Fastest-Growing Religions Among High School and College Students&#8221;    National Public Radio, May 13, 2004  (ibid)</p>
<p>In his book, &#8220;America&#8217;s Schools: The Battleground for Freedom,&#8221; Allen Quist warns:</p>
<p>&#8220;New Age religion is now aggressively being taught in our nation&#8217;s public schools.&#8221;  A model curriculum has been developed that &#8220;is clearly centered on pantheism.&#8221;  &#8220;Much of what passes for environmental education and multiculturalism is really indoctrination in pantheistic/New Age theology.  The ACLU and other similar organizations have no objections to (pantheistic indoctrination).  It is only Christianity that these organizations object to.&#8221;  (p. 51)</p>
<p>Tom DeWeese, President of the American Policy Center, has also been following the rise of occult pagan spirituality.  In a work entitled, &#8220;Teachers, Preachers and Greens: The Unholy Alliance to Transform America,&#8221;  DeWeese reveals the existence of a well-funded yet covert effort to paganize American society through an assault on schools and churches.  He reveals that the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City is the home of the enormously influential Gaia Institute as well as the  Temple of Understanding&#8212; a politically influential U.N. Non-Governmental Organization.   DeWeese describes a pagan &#8220;church service&#8221; at St. John the Divine:</p>
<p>&#8220;As the congregation sit in their church pews in the great Cathedral of St. John, the Divine in New York City, the priest stands at the alter, ready to receive a procession of animals for the annual Feast of Saint Francis blessing. Down the aisle comes a procession of elephants, camels, donkeys, monkeys and birds. These are followed by members of the congregation carrying bowls of compost and worms. Next, to the sounds of music, come acrobats and jugglers. In the pulpit, former Vice President Al Gore delivers a sermon, saying, “God is not separate from the Earth.” (<a href="http://www.federalobserver.com/2010/11/14/teachers-preachers-and-greens-the-unholy-alliance-to-transform-america/" target="_blank">http://www.federalobserver.com/2010/11/14/teachers-preachers-and-greens-the-unholy-alliance-to-transform-america/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Men Have Souls &#8230;and Demons Exist</strong></p>
<p>Today anthropologists, scientific psychiatrists, and other professionals from the counseling and medical field take very seriously the fact that something frightening and unexplainable by Western science is going on here in America and throughout the West.  In their search for answers they are jettisoning as useless materialist explanations. A &#8220;new&#8221; consensus is emerging:  Men have souls and demons exist:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;we need to understand a number of different concepts in order to comprehend the worldwide phenomenon of possession and exorcism. On the psychological level, we have come to know the notion underlying all possession, namely, that the body is a shell, inhabited by a soul, and that this shell may on occasion be surrendered to an intrusive alien entity. &#8221; (How about Demons? Possession and Exorcism in the Modern World, Felicitas Goodman. IndianaUpress:1988)</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr Frank Lake in a talk on the demonic recalled the occasion when &#8216;Hans Rudi Weber was giving a talk on Christ&#8217;s Victory over the Demonic Powers to this large gathering of psychiatrists and theologians. It was quite amusing to see how uncomfortable the theologians were at this strange exhibition of what I think they regarded as Medievalism from a distinguished member of their own theological group. It was as if they were apologizing to the scientific psychiatrists present that a theologian had returned to the era of demons and evil possession. By contrast the psychiatrists were in fact leaning forward eagerly recognizing that the collective demonic is something with which they are continually dealing. As they said afterwards, &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t some theologian tell us about this before? We know what he&#8217;s talking about, we live with it.&#8217;&#8221; (But Deliver us From Evil: An Introduction to the Demonic Dimension in Pastoral Care, John Richards, London, Dartman, Longman and Todd,1974)</p>
<p>Possession takes two forms, communal and individual:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;</strong>central possession is communal, strongly institutionalized, and ritualistically induced, but peripheral possession is more normally individual and spontaneous.&#8221; (Demonic Possession: A Medical, Historical, Anthropological, and Theological Symposium, John Warwick Montgomery (ed.), Bethany,1976)</p>
<p>“In later life,<strong> </strong>Jung admitted that he was open to the ideas that all these metapsychic phenomena could be explained better by the theory of spirits &#8230;.in the long run (he said) I have to admit that the spirit hypothesis yields better results in practice than any other.” (The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue, John P. Newport, Eerdmans,1998)</p>
<p>Dr. Carl Raschke also notes with alarm America&#8217;s downward spiral into the madness of occult spirituality.  He points out that the decadence, pornography, mass murders, criminality, the  &#8216;new religions,&#8217; and Satanism in American culture have certain social and spiritual ties that bind them together, revealing that they are part of a similar spiritual genus.   In &#8220;Satanism and the Devolution of the &#8216;New Religions,&#8217;&#8221; Raschke notes that Satanism is so widespread today that there are even U.S. military personnel who are members of secretive Satanist groups.</p>
<p>Raschke concludes that the &#8220;upsurge of Satanist practices&#8230;must be interpreted not as some kind of odd wrinkle&#8230;but as a culminating phase of the &#8220;New Age&#8221; movement&#8230;The Satanist mindset is not &#8220;religion&#8221; in the regular sense of the word, but a mystification of the most corrupt secular passions and values&#8230;Satanism is but the spiritual Frankenstein created by a social order that has attempted to sustain itself without God.&#8221;  (Satanism and Witchcraft: The Occult and the West&#8211;Part 6, Dr. John Ankerberg and Dr. John Weldon)</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;All the gods of the pagans are demons&#8221; Psalm 96:5</strong></p>
<p>New Age Cosmic Humanism has infused and spiritualized secular materialism, transforming it into an agency for the transmission of ultimate values and revelations from the unseen realm&#8230;.from powers and principalities.   As a result, in the space of a few short decades, occult pagan spirituality has made profound inroads.  Its upsurge manifests itself in the form of everything from UFO channeling cults, ghost-hunting, necromancy, goddess worship, shamanism, light-bearers, spirit guides, transcendental meditation, labyrinth walking, yoga, Wicca, revitalized Norse paganism, the annual Burning Man Festival (now televised)  and the proliferation of  Satanic cults.</p>
<p>From England to Australia, from New Zealand to South America, Canada and the United States, occult New Age spirituality is quickly becoming the West&#8217;s dominant orthodoxy.</p>
<p><strong>The End of the West?</strong></p>
<p>Evolutionary conceptions, monism, empiricism, reductionism, determinism, positivism, materialism, pantheism, socialism, and the &#8216;new religions,&#8217; in the words of Calvin Coolidge, are not &#8220;elements which we can see and touch,&#8221; but religious convictions, aspirations, ideals, and ideas in the minds of men.  As the great apocalyptic prophet Fyodor Dostoevsky clearly understood, they are a madness-inducing &#8220;fire in the minds of men&#8221; that comes from the &#8220;unseen world.&#8221;</p>
<p>This being the case, political fixes and Republicans in control will not cure what ails America because  Americans by and large, are spiritually diseased.   This means that our primary battle is spiritual, for we are not &#8220;contending against flesh and blood, but against the (evil spirits)&#8230;.against spiritual wickedness in the high places.&#8221; (Eph. 6:12)</p>
<p>Occult spirituality always surfaces at the end of a civilization.  It heralded the end of Babylon, Rome and the Aztec civilization.  It came at the end of the medieval world and now it has come at the end of  the post-Christian West&#8230;&#8221; a social order that has attempted to sustain itself without God.&#8221;</p>
<p>During Rome&#8217;s darkest, most evil hours, early Christians&#8212;thousands of whom were cut in half, used as human torches, and crucified upside-down&#8212;nevertheless successfully forced occult forces underground, thus allowing for Christendom and later on America to arise.</p>
<p>America is the West&#8217;s last best hope.  But do contemporary Christians and like-minded Americans possess the undying faith, unfaltering courage, love of Truth, rock-solid conviction, perseverance and will to engage this spiritual war?</p>

			<p><span>By Cahal Milmo  |  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/did-churchill-and-eisenhower-cover-up-ufo-encounter-2043641.html">Independent.co.uk&#8230; </a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/churchillikeufo3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/churchillikeufo2.jpg" alt="Gingrich-clown" /></a>With  a civilian population haunted by the Blitz and the Second World War  still in the balance, it was one development Winston Churchill could  have done without – an incursion into British airspace by an  arrow-shaped metallic object feared to contain an invasion force of  little green men.</p>
<p>Such was the sensitivity of an alleged UFO sighting by an RAF bomber  crew returning to England from a mission over Germany that Churchill  ordered it to be covered up with the words: &#8220;This event should be  immediately classified since it would create mass panic amongst the  general population and destroy one’s belief in the Church.&#8221;</p>
<p>This at least was the allegation put to the Ministry of Defence by  relatives of a senior British military aide who claimed to have  witnessed the cigar-chomping Prime Minister discuss the incident with  General Dwight Eisenhower as part of a meeting about a succession of  &#8220;foo fighter&#8221; sightings by Allied air crews in the Second World War.</p>
<p>The curious matter of visits by wartime aliens is one of hundreds of  reports of strange celestial phenomena – from a space station covered in  pulsating lights to an unusually agile rocket which buzzed a Boeing 737  at Manchester Airport – to be revealed in documents released today by  the National Archives in Kew, west London.</p>
<p>The files are the latest tranche of 11,000 UFO sightings logged by the  British Government between the early 1900s and 2000 to be released from  Ministry of Defence files, providing a candid insight into a national  obsession with suspected flying saucers and attempts by Whitehall  functionaries to explain that they were – almost always – nothing of the  sort.</p>
<p>Officials launched a investigation into the MoD files when the unnamed  grandson of the British military aide to Churchill wrote in 1999 saying  that the object seen by the RAF reconnaissance crew &#8220;appeared to hover  noiselessly relative to the aircraft&#8221;. The grandson, who described  himself as a scientist, said: &#8220;It appeared metallic&#8230; the object very  suddenly disappeared, leaving no trace of its earlier presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;This event was discussed by Mr Churchill and General  Eisenhower, neither of whom knew what had been observed. There was a  general inability for either side to match a plausible account to these  observations&#8230; another person raised the possibility of an unidentified  flying object, at which point Mr Churchill declared the incident should  be immediately classified for at least 50 years and its status reviewed  by a future prime minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>A trawl of documents revealed no existing record of the encounter. But  it was one of many sightings of fireballs and moving lights by Allied  aircraft during the Second World War. American pilots called them &#8220;foo  fighters&#8221; after a comic strip character who often said, &#8220;where there’s  foo there’s fire&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any decision by Churchill to halt publicity about the sightings has also  gone unrecorded but in July 1952, after a spate of reports in Britain  and the US, he wrote to the Air Ministry saying: &#8220;What does all this  stuff about flying saucers amount to? What can it mean? What is the  truth?&#8221; Unknown to Churchill, intelligence chiefs had formed The Flying  Saucer Working Party in 1950 to investigate the reports, with the  blessing of Lord Mountbatten, who thought the UFOs were alien craft.</p>
<p>The MOD has long stated it &#8220;knows of no evidence that substantiates the existence of these alleged phenomena&#8221;.</span></p>
