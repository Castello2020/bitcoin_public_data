<p>How corrupt has America become? It has become as corrupt as globalism itself, a byproduct in international greed, where the gutting of good paying jobs has relegated the United States to being nothing more than a third rate country with a first rate war machine. An essential aspect to what we regard as the American economy today is its reliance on fraud and corruption, from the banking sector to corporations exporting and outsourcing good jobs with the help of a political class that is not only fraudulent but treasonous to the extreme, they are driving America towards an abyss that it will not come back from.</p>
<p>Waging international war for resources under false pretenses is a globalists wet dream, and under the cloak of the nefarious “war on terror,” multinational defense and security firms have made trillions of dollars over the last decade. They destroy so they can rebuild, and all the human collateral damage is just an unsightly part of doing business.</p>
<p>Another perverse aspect to globalism is massive illegal immigration under the disreputable banner of multiculturalism, for some shady businesses in America the profit margins can increase exponentially by hiring illegal workers over Americans.</p>
<p>Corporations hire illegal workers to keep wages low, and benefits to an absolute minimum. Americans are shunned for unquestioning cheep labor, and governments allow and foster this fraud to the detriment of many Americans. Some Americans, if you can still call them Americans, profit greatly in this perverse atmosphere of fraud.  The Federal government consistently places the interests of illegal aliens and businesses who hire them over and above American workers and the ‘rule of law’.</p>
<p>A case in point is Oklahoma, specifically Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has become a hotbed of greed and corruption. Tulsa is what some call a sanctuary city, where tens of thousands of illegal workers are in jobs that Americans are obviously not occupying. This ugly fact is good for some corporations and businesses, expanding their profits by paying undocumented workers low wages with no real benefits. What does it cost the American tax payers when these illegal workers have babies and use the medical industry with false identities, who foots the medical bills?  It defiantly is not businesses or the governments.</p>
<p>Another case in point is a company called Name Brand Clothing; based in Tulsa, it has stores in six states, the company sells salvage clothing at 75 percent off retail and it prefers to hire illegal workers instead of Americans. It is the proverbial &#8216;poster child&#8217; for corporate greed and corruption in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Why does it hire illegal workers? Well, first of all, it is about greed, making some people rich at the expense of everyone else. The managers at Name Brand Clothing generate outrageous bonuses by essentially suppressing wages on all hourly paid employees year after year. They choose illegal workers because illegal’s do not complain about being stuck on minimum wage for years on end with no real medical benefits and no paid holidays.</p>
<p>The owners and managers of Name Brand Clothing knowingly and willingly submit false identifications and Social Security Numbers to the IRS and to the Oklahoma Tax Commission, which is of course contrary to both federal and state laws. They have been doing this for over a decade, and they can commit these criminal acts because Federal and State governments are currently as corrupt and dishonest as companies like Name Brand Clothing.</p>
<p>Veracity Voice interviewed a long time worker at Name Brands Clothing for an inside examination into the workings of corporate greed and corruption that currently plagues corporate America.</p>
<p>We are protecting the person’s identity because the person is still currently employed by the company. We will refer to that person as the ‘Employee’.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: How long have you been working for Name Brands?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: I rather not say exactly since I still work for them, lets just say that I have been employed at Name Brands for about 10 years, give or take a couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What do you do there?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Again, I rather not say exactly, lets just say I worked in the head office, and have seen the corruption first hand.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Why have you decided to speak out at this time, and not before?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Actually I did in a way speak about this before; I wrote a letter to the Sheriff’s department, and the FBI about 4 years ago. I also wrote letters too FOX 23 and Channel Six News, concerning the outlandish fraud and corruption happening at Name Brands, and absolutely nothing came of it. It seems that it is not PC to talk about this issue in Tulsa; the mainstream media won’t touch it. That is why I am talking with Veracity Voice; the only outlet whistleblowers have today in America is in the alternative media.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Are you saying that the mainstream media is covering it up?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: In a way they are by not reporting all the law breaking going around Tulsa as far as hiring illegal workers by businesses, they certainly seem to be part of the club, and will not rock the boat.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What Club?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Corrupt businesses, Local, State and Federal governments that allow the criminal behavior, the police departments that will not enforce the law and mainstream media that will not report any of it. It is one big corrupt club.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What kind of fraud and corruption have you seen at Name Brands?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Well, you can compare the greed and corruption at Name Brands along the lines of what’s happening in Wall Street and the financial system, some people are profiting greatly through outright fraud and thievery at the expense of everyone else, and government is engaged in helping the criminality.</p>
<p>At Name Brands, the fraud is done by submitting false ID’s and Social Security Numbers (SSN) to the IRS. I’ve seen with my own eyes management turn away American workers seeking work then turn around and hire illegals. The main reason they do this, Is because the illegals are content to work for minimum wage with no real benefits. Essentially, they keep everyone’s wages stagnant except for management.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What do you mean except for management?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: The lower the costs for running the business, the higher the bonuses for management, its classic corporate greed. Management at Name Brands make large sums of money in the form of bonuses while all other workers do not receive real medical benefits or paid holidays except for two, Thanksgiving and Christmas, and those two paid holidays are highly conditional.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Highly conditional?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Yes, two weeks prior to Thanksgiving and Christmas if an employee is late for work for any reason Name Brands will not pay you for the holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: You’re kidding right?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: No, unfortunately I’m not kidding. At Name Brands it’s a culture of nepotism and greed, like the saying goes “there is no honor among thieves” there is no honesty, no real integrity, just godless corruption. There is one woman, who has worked for the company for 17 years, and she has only received one 5 cent raise not counting minimum wage increases. It’s outright disgusting how they treat workers.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Why does she stay?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Well, some people have problems, and finding other employment can be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What kind of problems?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: All sorts of problems like emotional and mental problems, in some cases drug problems, other cases workers being ex-convicts, finding employment can be difficult. Like some parasite, companies like Name Brands like to take advantage of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society, that’s why they like illegals; they can thieve from them without any complaint, protected by corrupt governments. Most self-respecting Americans will not work for a company that treats hourly workers like trash.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Let’s get back to the fraud, how many illegals are they employing?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: At TPC which is Name Brands production center in North Tulsa, they usually have around 80 illegals working there, and at their store in South Tulsa there are about 10.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: That many?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Yes, it’s absolutely incredulous and in your face. It is both frustrating and depressing at the same time to see this traitorous conduct on a daily basis. It is time for Americans to take a stand against these globalists that are profiting through corruption.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Who are the people that run Name Brands Clothing in Tulsa?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: As far as I know, Rusty Gaddy is the CEO, Jim Stevenson and Jim Breese are VP’s. At TPC there is Reid Lewellin and Jason Garman, both managers, and Brent Daily is the manager at the Tulsa Store, they all commit fraud on a daily bases. They do not care for America or Americans, all they care about is increasing their bonuses at the expense of everyone else, and what really bothers me is that the governments, both at the local and federal level engage in the same fraud, they do absolutely nothing about it. The Federal government knows very well that Name Brands has for well over a decade submitted thousands of false ID’s and SSN’s. This is criminal behavior at both the local and Federal level when the government chooses not to enforce its own laws.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What do you think should be done with these people?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: These people are more than thieving fraudsters, they are traitors to the country and its people, so I say arrest Rusty Gaddy, arrest Jim Breese, arrest Jason Garman and Reid Lewellin, and arrest all of the crooks that run the criminal enterprise called Name Brands Clothing. These people are also very cowardly, if they find out that any employee is against their corruption they will slander him or her with false accusations, they will make up stuff to make that employee look bad. The two most egregious slanderers at Name Brands are Jason Garman and Jim Breese, they will slander and harass you to the point of desperation, and people will quit their jobs because of the continual harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Job harassment is a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Yes, and they get away with that too.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Talk a little bit about the one man that has used more than one ID to work at Name Brands.</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Ya, he has three different aliases. I do not know which one is his real name, all I know is that Name Brands went out and got him a new fake ID, when they found out that the old ID the man was using belonged to a another man.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Where did they get the fake ID?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: I do not know for sure, I heard that they went to some website run by the Federal government, and it provided Name Brands with a fake ID.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What do you think should be done with companies that choose to break the law as a regular part of doing business?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Again, arrest and prosecute the criminals, if law enforcement will not do their jobs, then Americans need to start fighting back by boycotting corporations like Name Brands that fragrantly and openly break the law. I mean these people act like it’s the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century or something; these anti-American globalists &#8211; at the end of the day that’s what these people really are &#8211; Name Brands conducts business like multinationals that run sweatshops all over the third world. They help create the culture of illegal behavior, by giving employment to illegals, which allows the illegals to stay in the city, drive vehicles without drivers licenses and insurance, use emergency Heath Services at taxpayer cost, they currently function ‘above the law’ and all accountability. Real Americans need to stand up against these criminals before they completely destroy this country.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Many in the business sector and in the political establishment will argue that the illegals fill jobs that Americans will not do, this reasoning is also pushed by the mainstream media, what do you say to this reasoning?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: I think it is a false argument, I&#8217;ve seen with my own eyes Name Brands turn away Americans willing to work, in some cases desperate for a job, they are turned away in favor of hiring illegals. So, that kind of reasoning is nothing more than an illusion.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Some will charge you with racism for holding these views, how do you respond to this kind of slander? </p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: It has been my experience that those that accuse people of being racist are in fact racists themselves. They falsely accuse others of being racist so they could push their nefarious agenda by smearing the reputations of those that are opposed to their mendacity and corruption. The charge of racism holds no water in the case of illegal immigration.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Why don’t you look for another job?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: I am its not easy finding work these days. And if I quit, I probably will not be able to collect unemployment benefits if I can’t find a job.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Because Name Brands will fight against your right to obtain unemployment insurance, its company policy. They will send their managers to testify against your eligibility for unemployment benefits, and they will without any hesitation, lie and malign anyone applying for the benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: They have done this before, entered false information against former employees to the Unemployment Bureau?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Yes, many times, and they get away with that too, companies like Name Brands function ‘above the law,’ and it must stop now.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p>The massive unrestrained flux in illegal immigration has changed the demographics of Tulsa, forcing many businesses to provide bilingual services, including city and state government services at great cost to the taxpayer. It is the ongoing balkanization of the city where east Tulsa is now known as little Mexico, a criminal and negative phenomenon that is currently occurring in many cities across the nation.</p>

			<p><strong>Part 1:  Changing the DNA structure of the Mother Nature&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/belgianblue3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>In the 20st century, the human mob re-arranged rivers, deserts, rainforests and the oceans to suit its voracious appetite for dominance over the Natural World.  Stemming from that 100-year epic onslaught, we humans created communities around the globe featuring 10 million, 20 million to 36 million people piled up in mega-cities around the world.</p>
<p>We contaminated rivers with our poisons, the air with our fossil fuel exhaust and clear cut rainforests by the millions of acres.  Our onslaught of the Natural World continues with 80 to 100 species of our fellow travelers losing their existence 24/7 to our encroachment upon their habitat. (Source: Norman Myers, Oxford University)</p>
<p>One of our most prolific acts continues on the bees and other pollinators around the world.  In the past 50 years, we poisoned every crop with hundreds of chemical herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers, which, in turn, caused trillions of bees to suffer “Colony Collapse” throughout the world.  Without the bees, which I wrote about earlier this year, our species cannot feed itself.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, in the 21st century, in order to feed our 7.2 billion in numbers, we began tinkering with the structural DNA of plants and animals. </p>
<p>Today, our scientists change the DNA patterns of fish and plants in order to make them bigger, grow faster and yield more harvest: genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p>But we forgot to ask Mother Nature if our meddling in her business would cause any harm.  Amazingly, we allow governments, scientists on the payroll of companies like ADM and Monsanto, to tell us that such activities work to make our lives better with no harm to the natural world.</p>
<p>With my research on GMOs connecting their horrific harm to the Natural World and ultimately to we humans, this series will show you the “GMO Frankenstein” being foisted upon us by ugly businessmen in high places to could care less about you, your family or the rest of the species sharing this planet with us.</p>
<p>My intention in writing this series: to educate you to the incredible damage GMO foods cause you along with your family and more important: the horrific destruction to the Natural World.</p>
<p>If you look at human cancers spreading like wildfire across America and the world and every physical ailment we face in America, along the accelerating damage to bees, other pollinators and to the fish in our oceans—you will become appalled at this onslaught and its final consequences.</p>
<p>Investigative reporter Jeremy Siefert said, “When people first hear about just the basic facts concerning Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs or Genetically Engineered Foods) – the DNA of seeds altered with genes from other organisms like bacteria so food crops can withstand herbicides that will kill all other plants, patented by giant chemical companies and found in 80% of processed foods – the standard response is “Oh, my God.” For some, it’s just an exclamation, but for others, it’s the beginnings of a prayer. There’s a mixture of horror and disbelief, as if finding out we’re living inside a very strange sci-fi novel. Beyond that, it’s the sting of humiliation from being ignorant about something so big, mixed with the anger that comes from feeling like you’ve been duped.</p>
<p>“Even without understanding what a GMO is or why it matters, most of us believe as citizens of a supposedly free and democratic society that we have the right to know if GMOs are in the food we eat. The fact we don’t know, and that our right to know has been taken away by corporate greed and government collusion, should upset and mobilize people. When all the food and seed and water and air is owned and patented by giant multinational corporations, will we even protest? Do we have the wakefulness and willpower to take that first step and stand up for this basic right?” (Source: <a href="http://www.fairworldproject.org">www.fairworldproject.org</a>)</p>
<p>What I discovered in my research: ADM and Monsanto do not want you to know, along with high government officials, the deleterious effects on the Natural World that GMO food production causes in the long run.  These mega-giant corporations “own” regulatory agencies, government officials (bribes or dandy trips to anywhere in the world), and other complicit chemical companies around the world.</p>
<p>Be warned, you will not like the kind of treachery being foisted upon you by your U.S. Congress and officials who should present a moral and ethical stance against GMOs, but fail us because of one item: money.</p>
<p>Thus, as we move through this series, you may choose to save yourself and your family by buying “Certified Organic Foods” along with “Certified Non-Genetically Modified Organism” foods that give you the nutrients of Mother Nature without the “Frankenization” of your food supply and of the planet’s natural systems.  Additionally, Monsanto and other HUGE corporations work every angle to stop any “GMO” labeling of their poisonous foods.  Why do you think the do that?</p>
<p>If this information educates you enough, you may take action provided in the organizations and leaders trying to rid the world of GMOs.  Help them and ultimately, you will help your family.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if these “monsters” of Monsanto and ADM get their way, they will cripple this world, all living creatures and the structural systems that allow all life on Earth to remain in balance and allow us all to thrive.</p>

			<div class="date">
				<p>April 2, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17228#respond" title="Comment on The Burning of Judas and the Problem of Evil"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17228 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17228">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/judasburnig3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/judasburnig2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Last night, the people of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas gathered in the town square to witness the traditional burning of Judas. The burning of Judas in effigy is a local custom taking place at the end of Holy Week (“Semana Santa”). The square behind the Palacio Municipal was packed with thousands of locals, who climbed onto stairways and shimmied up columns in order to get a better look at the symbolic end of evil.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, ten large plastic sculptures by local artists, depicting perpetrators of social and political injustice, were placed on display in the square.  The theme for this year&#8217;s depiction of our current Judases was “Mistreatment of babies.”  Not to be harnessed by literal constraints, the artwork depicted a wide range of perpetrators of harm and injustice, including Uncle Sam, a bankster holding aloft a large bag of money and a reptilian sort of dragon which seemed intent on global domination.</p>
<p>At the stroke of ten, the burnings commenced. One by one, each piece of art was pyrotechnically exploded into flames, while pinwheels of fireworks arched up into the sky above the square.  The crowd itself exploded into applause, while depictions of oppression and corporate greed transmogrified into ten pyres of burning annihilation.</p>
<p>One of the art works was apparently seeded too heavily with explosives and at the time of detonation, huge sparks rained down on the crowd. A stampede ensued, as the crowd rushed for the cover of the Palacio Municipal. There were no reports of injuries sustained.</p>
<p>Symbolically,  the destruction of evil and the triumph of good laces all our myths, our religious texts and our modern day political constructs, not to mention the celluloid outspewings of Hollywood.  The thirst for justice and the conquest of evil seems basic to the human story.  In the United States, this thirst for justice has assumed again a nearly mythic stature, as our populace is waking up to history:  <em>Our</em> history, the truth behind the dream of America, the truth of imperial greed and slaughter, the killing of the indigenous, the enslavement of people of color, of wars based on lies and contempt for human life and the mockery of justice which is now taking place every day in our halls of justice.</p>
<p>But behind this thirst for justice lies a deeply disturbing question. How does one conquer evil without oneself using the tools and methods of evil?  Does a guillotine chopping off the head of a  king or prince actually end the reign of corruption or does it simply confirm and perpetuate violence as a means of asserting self- will?  And &#8212;this question cuts to the core&#8211;does the one manning the guillotine soon use this power to become the very oppressor he sought to defeat?</p>
<p>In a recent interview (<a href="http://youtu.be/BKCVmJoS2PU">http://youtu.be/BKCVmJoS2PU</a>), Howard Nema and I discussed the burning of Judas and also some recent revelations of corruption in a county in Southern California, as well as the apparently successful intimidation of a brave and beloved San Bernardino county activist by &#8230;.well, those manning the guillotine.  These days, one sees lights being extinguished, dampened and diminished everywhere one looks.   Telling the truth and acting upon that knowledge of right vs. wrong is becoming an increasingly perilous endeavor. </p>
<p>The light we should seek and applaud is not, to my way of thinking, the pyre of a burning Judas.  The flames that should be drawing us into town squares, into virtual meeting places on the web, into our spiritual sacred spaces and into our political meeting halls are the lights carried by each and every one of us who still knows wrong from right and has the courage to speak out. These are the sparks of the Divine flame which need to be honored and these are the lights which will be passed and carried through the generations.</p>
<p>Fear has a way of darkening the light. If it is any comfort, no one gets out of here alive. Not a Judas, not a Christ, and certainly not you or me. What will remain behind us is our light and what we have done during our brief tenure on this embattled planet.  Whether this legacy pushes back the darkness or, out of fear and a sense of self preservation instead solidifies and strengthens the darkness is entirely up to us. </p>
<p>Yes, there is indeed a battle going on and the battlefield is in the hearts and minds of every one of us. As the old Indian legend tells it, each of us contains two wolves—the good wolf and the bad wolf. Which wolf gains ascendancy depends on which one we feed. The Judas burning last night in the central square may have been the externalization of the Judas that lurks in each of us. It may be time to confront him, face to face and without illusions.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/StCharlesBendOrg3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/StCharlesBendOrg2.jpg" align="left" /></a>In 2010/2011, workers at St. Charles Hospital in Bend, Oregon came together to join Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 49 to improve their conditions and strengthen their voice. It was the largest union organizing victory in Oregon for 30 years. This victory held great promise for not only St. Charles&#8217;s service workers, but all workers in Central Oregon and health care employees statewide.</p>
<p>On November 1st of this year, workers voted to decertify SEIU Local 49 in a vote of 334 to 212. Why this bitter reversal in less than two years?</p>
<p>To start to answer this question it is necessary to understand how the laws in this nation favor employers at the expense of workers&#8217; unity.</p>
<p>To win legal recognition of a union, by itself, is an exercise in jumping through bureaucratic hoops and being set up for employer intimidation. A vote alone is not enough. Even if a super majority signs cards to join, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) requires that another election must be held six weeks after these cards are turned in. This gives the employer a big window to begin to intimidate employees with captive meetings and other tactics where the employer can discourage a yes vote.</p>
<p>In spite of this, workers&#8217; at St. Charles stood strong and won legal recognition by a narrow vote in favor of joining SEIU Local 49. However, the biggest challenge was only starting. Workers needed to negotiate a contract with the administration of St. Charles who were determined not to cede the slightest control of their power.</p>
<p>The strategy of the St. Charles administration was simple. Show up to the bargaining table to fulfill their legal requirement, but refuse to negotiate in any meaningful way. After a year they would be free to start a decertification campaign and, if all goes well, get rid of the union.</p>
<p>Using dollars that could have been spent on patient care and improving the wages and benefits of their employees, St. Charles hired the second largest anti-union consultant in America. No doubt, these efforts were supported by hospital CEOs across the state.</p>
<p>They conducted an aggressive campaign to find ways to fire union leaders and targeting pro-union employees for intimidation. Thirty percent of St. Charles service workers signed a petition to have a decertification vote. This minority was enough to set the wheels in motion to set up an NLRB election to get rid of the union, whereas, it takes a majority of workers to have an election to vote in a union.</p>
<p>So over the top were the St. Charles administration&#8217;s efforts that they flagrantly broke labor law. The union filed several Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges with the NLRB and the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries. As a result, the calendar date to have a decertification vote was put on hold.</p>
<p>This did not, however, make the administration any more flexible at the bargaining table. Because the process of investigation and judgment is incredibly slow and the penalties are weak for ULPs, they treated all this as a minor annoyance. Meanwhile, the employees continued to be subject to the pressure of the St. Charles anti-union campaign, and saw no satisfactory progress in bargaining, which seemed to be going on with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Even with a likely favorable ruling regarding the ULPs, a decertification vote would eventually have to take place. Consequently, the union decided to lift the hold on the vote calendar date because of the ULPs.</p>
<p>When the votes came in, it was clear that the majority of the St. Charles service workers were exhausted by the intimidation as well as frustrated and decided to decertify. A legal system tilted in favor of big business combined with the St. Charles administration&#8217;s intransience and deep pockets won the day for corporate greed. SEIU Local 49 has not yet decided whether to challenge the results.</p>
<p>But, as the old saying goes, the battle might be lost, but not the war. It is necessary to draw the lessons of this defeat and adjust tactics in order to win.</p>
<p>When the staff of SEIU Local 49 got a call that the workers of St. Charles Bend needed their assistance to pull together and resist the greed of their employer, the union did the right thing and threw considerable effort into the cause. Even with the decertification, the workers at St. Charles are in a better position today to conduct collective concerted action than they were before SEIU Local 49 jumped in.</p>
<p>St. Charles has four hospitals and is by far the largest employer in Central Oregon. They have no serious competitors in the region. They can afford to care nothing about public opinion, only the bottom line.</p>
<p>Consequently, though the hospital in Bend is their largest, the administration is in a strong position to resist a union organizing campaign at only one of their facilities. They have the resources to do so with a monopoly of health care services in Central Oregon and anti-union consultants willing to provide their services for a fat fee.</p>
<p>A union&#8217;s strength relies on its ability to organize the majority of workers on an industry wide basis. A union organizing drive at St. Charles would be strongest if it could build organizing committees at all four of its hospitals.</p>
<p>In addition, unions are at their strongest when they act as a social movement and link community needs to the needs of its members. Such links, if seriously built, have the potential of choking the employer&#8217;s profits if the union goes on strike with massive community support on the picket lines. The employers know this and are more likely to negotiate a fair contract in order to avoid such action if they see the growth of such a development.</p>
<p>At this stage, immediately focusing on a campaign to re-win union representation at St. Charles Bend alone may not be the best step forward. Rather, it would be better to adjust organizing tactics by encouraging the organizing of a social movement that would take collective action on the issues of health care and workers&#8217; justice in Central Oregon. It would include working members at all of St. Charles facilities as well as community members and former employees. It is this kind of solidarity that is at the heart of the union movement and will facilitate the winning of formal union recognition at St. Charles as part of a larger struggle.</p>
<p>A potential model would be OurWalmart. This organization was initiated and supported by the United Food and Commercial Workers&#8217; (UFCW) union though OurWalmart&#8217;s members decide on their own actions. While the first efforts to organize workers into the UFCW failed at Walmart, the growth of OurWalmart has greatly helped future victories. It is because of the growth of OurWalmart that workers have been able to go out on strikes at numerous Walmart facilities for the first time in the company&#8217;s history. These workers went on strike to protest unfair labor practices such as retaliation against workers for taking collective action, which is legally protected even without the formal recognition of a union. As a result, they have Walmart on the defensive and have been able to win improvements to their conditions. The experience of such victories through sticking together is teaching Walmart workers about the potential of winning more if they form a union.</p>
<p>The service workers at St. Charles Bend already have a strong organizing committee. They could act as a springboard for a more broad based community organization to promote a culture of health care worker/community solidarity in Central Oregon. This will encourage future union organizing efforts at St. Charles on a wider level.</p>
<p>While labor law favors the employer in this nation, there are always ways to overcome this obstacle. The decertification of SEIU Local 49 at St. Charles Bend is a setback, but often out of setback come new opportunities.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/barrack-aipac-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/barrack-aipac-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>The battle for justice in the Middle East is our battle. It is part of the vast, global battle against the 1 percent. It is about living rather than dying. It is about communicating rather than killing. It is about love rather than hate. It is part of the great battle against the corporate forces of death that reign over us—the fossil fuel industry, the weapons manufacturers, the security and surveillance state, the speculators on Wall Street, the oligarchic elites who assault our poor, our working men and women, our children, one in four of whom depend on food stamps to eat, the elites who are destroying our ecosystem with its trees, its air and its water and throwing into doubt our survival as a species.</p>
<p>What is being done in Gaza, the world’s largest open-air prison, is a pale reflection of what is slowly happening to the rest of us. It is a window into the rise of the global security state, our new governing system that the political philosopher <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8606.html" rel="nofollow">Sheldon Wolin</a> calls “inverted totalitarianism.” It is a reflection of a world where the powerful are not bound by law, either on Wall Street or in the shattered remains of the countries we invade and occupy, including Iraq with its hundreds of thousands of dead. And one of the greatest purveyors of this demented ideology of violence for the sake of violence, this flagrant disregard for the rule of domestic and international law, is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or <a href="http://action.aipac.org/welcome/6/" rel="nofollow">AIPAC</a>.</p>
<p>I spent seven years in the Middle East. I was the Middle East bureau chief for The New York Times. I lived for two of those seven years in Jerusalem. AIPAC does not speak for Jews or for Israel. It is a mouthpiece for right-wing ideologues, some of whom hold power in Israel and some of whom hold power in Washington, who believe that because they have the capacity to war wage they have a right to wage war, whose loyalty, in the end, is not to the citizens of Israel or Palestine or the United States but the corporate elites, the defense contractors, those who make war a business, those who have turned ordinary Palestinians, Israelis and Americans, along with hundreds of millions of the world’s poor, into commodities to exploit, repress and control.</p>
<p>We have not brought freedom, democracy and the virtues of Western civilization to the Muslim world. We have brought state terrorism, massive destruction, war and death. There is no moral distinction between a drone strike and the explosion of the improvised explosive device, between a suicide bombing and a targeted assassination. We have used the iron fist of the American military to implant our oil companies in Iraq, occupy Afghanistan and ensure that the Muslim world remains submissive and compliant. We have supported a government in Israel that has carried out egregious war crimes in Lebanon and Gaza and is daily stealing larger and larger portions of Palestinian land. We have established a network of military bases, some the size of small cities, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Kuwait, and we have secured basing rights in the Gulf states of Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. We have expanded our military operations to Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Egypt, Algeria and Yemen. And no one believes, except perhaps us, that we have any intention of leaving.</p>
<p>And let us not forget that deep inside our secret world of offshore penal colonies, black sites, and torture and interrogation centers, we practice the cruelty and barbarity that always accompanies unchecked imperial power. There were scores of graphic pictures and videos from the prison in Abu Ghraib that were swiftly classified and hidden from public view. And in these videos, as <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/seymour_m_hersh/search?contributorName=seymour%20m%20hersh" rel="nofollow">Seymour Hersh</a> reported, mothers who were arrested with their young sons, often children, watched in horror as their boys were repeatedly sodomized. This was filmed. And on the soundtrack you hear the boys shrieking. And the mothers were smuggling notes out to their families saying, “Come and kill us because of what is happening.”</p>
<p>We are the biggest problem in the Middle East. It is we who legitimize the Mahmoud Ahmadinejads, suicide bombers and radical jihadists. The longer we drop iron fragmentation bombs and seize Muslim land, the longer we kill with impunity, the more these monsters, reflections of our own distorted image, will proliferate.</p>
<p>“If you gaze into the abyss,” Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, “the abyss gazes into you.”</p>
<p>I am no friend of the Iranian regime, which helped create and arm Hezbollah, is certainly meddling in Iraq, has persecuted human rights activists, gays, women and religious and ethnic minorities, embraces racism and intolerance, and uses its power to deny popular will. And yes, it is a regime that appears determined to build a nuclear weapon, although I would stress that no one has offered any proof this is occurring. I have spent time in Iranian jails. I was once deported from Tehran in handcuffs. But I do not remember Iran orchestrating a coup in the United States to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d'%C3%A9tat" rel="nofollow">replace an elected government</a> with a brutal dictator who for decades persecuted, assassinated and imprisoned democracy activists. I do not remember Iran <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war" rel="nofollow">arming and funding</a> a neighboring state to wage war against our country. Iran never shot down one of our passenger jets, as did the USS Vincennes—nicknamed Robocruiser by the crews of other American vessels—when in June 1988 it fired missiles at an Airbus filled with Iranian civilians, killing everyone on board. Iran is not sponsoring terrorist strikes within the United States, as our intelligence services and the Israeli intelligence services currently do in Iran. We have not seen five of our top nuclear scientists since 2007 murdered on American soil. The attacks in Iran include suicide bombings, kidnappings, beheadings, sabotage and “targeted assassinations” of government officials and other Iranian leaders. What would we do if the situation were reversed? How would we react if Iran carried out similar acts of terrorism against us?</p>
<p>We are, and have long been, the primary engine for radicalism in the Middle East. The greatest favor we can do for democracy activists in Iran, as well as in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Gulf and the states that dot North Africa, is to withdraw our troops from the region and begin to speak to Iranians and the rest of the Muslim world in the civilized language of diplomacy, respect and mutual interests. The longer we cling to the doomed doctrine of permanent war the more we give credibility to the extremists who need, indeed yearn for, an enemy that speaks in the same crude slogans of nationalist cant and violence that they do. The louder the Israelis and their idiot allies in Washington call for the bombing of Iran to thwart its nuclear ambitions, the happier are the morally bankrupt clerics who are ordering the beating and murder of demonstrators. We may laugh when crowds supporting [President] Ahmadinejad call us “the Great Satan,” but there is a very palpable reality that informs the terrible algebra of their hatred. And since even the most optimistic scenarios say that any strike on Iranian nuclear installations will at best set back Iran’s alleged weapons program by [only] three or four years, we can be sure that violence will beget violence, just as fanaticism begets fanaticism.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy of this vaunted moral crusade is not lost on those in the Middle East. Iran signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pakistan, India and Israel did not and developed nuclear weapons programs in secret. Israel now has an estimated 400 to 600 nuclear weapons. The word “Dimona,” the name of the city where the nuclear facilities are located in Israel, is shorthand in the Muslim world for the deadly Israeli threat to Muslims’ existence.</p>
<p>What lessons did the Iranians learn from our Israeli, Pakistani and Indian allies?</p>
<p>Given that we are actively engaged in an effort to destabilize the Iranian regime, given that we use apocalyptic rhetoric to describe what must be done to the Iranian regime, and given that Israel could obliterate Iran many times over, what do we expect from the Iranians? On top of this, the Iranian regime grasps that the doctrine of permanent war entails making “pre-emptive” and unprovoked strikes. And they know that if Iraq, like North Korea, had had a bomb they would have never suffered American invasion and occupation.</p>
<p>Those in Washington who advocate attacking Iran, knowing as little about the limitations and chaos of war as they do about the Middle East, believe they can cripple nuclear production and neutralize the 850,000-man Iranian army. They should look closely at the 2006 Israeli air campaign in southern Lebanon, which saw Hezbollah victorious and united most Lebanese behind the militant Islamic group. If the massive Israeli bombing of Lebanon failed to pacify 4 million Lebanese, how can we expect to pacify a country of 70 million people? But reality never seems to impinge on the neoconservative universe or the efficacy of its doctrine of permanent war.</p>
<p>I have watched over the years as these neoconservatives have meddled disastrously in the Middle East. The support by neoconservatives of the Israeli right wing—and I covered Yitzhak Rabin’s 1992 campaign for prime minister when prominent AIPAC donors poured money and resources into Likud to defeat Rabin—is not about Israel. It is about advancing this perverted ideology. Rabin detested these neoconservatives. When he made his first visit to Washington after being elected prime minister he dismissed requests from the lobby for a meeting by telling aides: “I don’t speak to scumbags.”</p>
<p>These neoconservatives, who like our own neoconservatives hide behind the rhetoric of patriotism, national security and religious piety, are not wedded to any discernable doctrine other than force. They, like all rabid nationalists, are stunted and deformed individuals, only able to communicate in the language of self-exaltation and violence.</p>
<p>“The nationalist is by definition an ignoramus,” the Yugoslav writer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_Ki%C5%A1" rel="nofollow">Danilo Kiš</a> wrote. “Nationalism is the line of least resistance, the easy way. The nationalist is untroubled, he knows or thinks he knows what his values are, his, that’s to say national, that’s to say the values of the nation he belongs to, ethical and political; he is not interested in others, <em>they are no concern of his</em>, hell—it’s other people (other nations, another tribe). They don’t even need investigating. The nationalist sees other people in his own images—as nationalists.”</p>
<p>AIPAC does not drive Middle Eastern policy in the United States. I am afraid it is worse than that. AIPAC is one of an array of powerful and well-funded neoconservative institutions that worship force and drive our relations with the rest of the world. These neoconservatives choose an enemy and then our compliant class of journalists, specialists, military analysts, columnists and television commentators line up to serve as giddy cheerleaders for war. Moments like these always make me embarrassed to be a reporter. Our political elite, Republican and Democrat, finds in this ideology a simple, childish allure. This ideology does not require cultural, historical or linguistic literacy. It reduces the world to black and white, good and evil. The drumbeat for war with Iran sounded by AIPAC is part of this broad, sick, binary vision of a world that can be subjugated by force, a world where all will be made to kneel before these corporate and neoconservative elites, where none, including finally us, will be permitted to whisper dissent.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive war, under post-Nuremberg law, is defined as a criminal act of aggression. George W. Bush, whose disregard for the rule of law was legend, went to the U.N. for a resolution to attack Iraq, although his interpretation of the U.N. resolution as justifying the invasion of Iraq had dubious legal merit. But in this current debate over war with Iran, that pretense of legality is ignored. Where is Israel’s U.N. resolution authorizing it to strike Iran? Why isn’t anyone demanding that Israel seek one? Why does the only discussion in the media and among political elites center around the questions of “Will Israel attack Iran?” “Can it successfully carry out an attack?” “What will happen if there is an attack?” The essential question is left unasked. Does Israel have the right to attack Iran? And here the answer is very, very clear. It does not.</p>
<p>These neoconservatives were too blind and too enamored of their own power to see what invading Afghanistan and Iraq would trigger; so too are they unable to comprehend the regional conflagration that would be unleashed by attacking Iran, what it would mean for us, for Israel, for our allies and for tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of innocents.</p>
<p>“Where there is no vision, the people perish,” the Bible warns.</p>
<p>And since our elites have no vision it is up to us. The uprisings from Tunisia to Egypt to Greece to Occupy Wall Street to our gathering outside AIPAC’s doors in Washington are the same primal struggle for sanity, peace and justice, for a world wrenched free from the grip of those who would destroy it. And the abject fawning of our political elite, including Barack Obama, before AIPAC and its bank account is yet another window into the moral bankruptcy of our political class, another sign that the formal mechanisms of power are useless and broken. Civil disobedience is all we have left. It is our patriotic duty. We are called to make the cries of mothers, fathers and children in the squalid refugee camps in Gaza, in the suburbs of Tehran and in the bleak industrial wastelands in Ohio heard. We are called to stand up before these forces of death, the purveyors of violence, those whose hearts have grown cold with hatred. We are called to embrace and defend life with intensity and passion if we are to survive as a species, if we are to save our planet from the ravages of corporate greed and the specter of endless and futile war.</p>
<p>The Israeli poet <a href="http://www.poetryinternational.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=3158" rel="nofollow">Aharon Shabtai</a>, in his poem “Rypin,” translated by Peter Cole, examined what power, force and self-worship do to compassion, justice and human decency. Rypin was the Polish town his father escaped from during the pogroms.</p>
<blockquote><p>These creatures in helmets and khakis,<br />
I say to myself, aren’t Jews,<br />
In the truest sense of the word. A Jew<br />
Doesn’t dress himself up with weapons like jewelry,<br />
Doesn’t believe in the barrel of a gun aimed at a target,<br />
But in the thumb of the child who was shot at—<br />
In the house through which he comes and goes,<br />
Not in the charge that blows it apart.<br />
The coarse soul and iron first<br />
He scorns by nature.<br />
He lifts his eyes not to the officer, or the soldier<br />
With his finger on the trigger—but to justice,<br />
And he cries out for compassion.<br />
Therefore, he won’t steal land from its people<br />
And will not starve them in camps.<br />
The voice calling for expulsion<br />
Is heard from the hoarse throat of the oppressor—<br />
A sure sign that the Jew has entered a foreign country<br />
And, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Saba" rel="nofollow">Umberto Saba</a>, gone into hiding within his own city.<br />
Because of voices like these, father<br />
At age sixteen, with your family, you fled Rypin;<br />
Now here Rypin is your son.</p></blockquote>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ecology-and-capitalism3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ecology-and-capitalism2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Contrary to everything we have been taught, there is no actual United States of America. The U.S. is an occupied territory that could more accurately be described as the Corporate States of America. If the geopolitical states are united, the people are not. We are a nation divided by ideology and by social and economic class. The U.S. is not a democracy and it never was. The systems of power do not allow the voice of working people to be heard or their collective will to be acted upon.</p>
<p>Despite the subterfuge of freedom and democracy, the rights of corporations have consistently superseded the sovereign rights of the individual and those of the community. Labor history and a litany of environmental catastrophes bear this out. For instance, everywhere one looks government agencies, ostensibly created to protect the public welfare, are allowing hydraulic fracturing of Marcellus shale, even when it poisons municipal drinking water and causes incalculable harm to the environment.</p>
<p>Our diverse forests are commodified, measured in board feet to be clear-cut and off-shored at prodigious bargain rates, like a liquidation sale. World class biodiversity is yielding to desertification and monoculture. Money changes hands. The few are getting rich at the expense of the many. The world and the people who live in it are treated like products to be exploited. We are told that nothing is sacred, save for the dollar and markets.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is an inescapable fact that no human being, including corporate CEOs and members of Congress, can live without potable water or breathable air. We are literally sacrificing the Earth’s life support systems and mortgaging the future, while attempting to satiate the greed of a few grotesquely wealthy individuals. Through lifelong indoctrination, Americans are persuaded that self-interested greed is in their best interest.</p>
<p>The rich and powerful have decreed that corporate profits, the Holy Grail of American capitalism, are more precious than life itself. The remorseless people in power are without conscience. History confirms that sociopaths do not hesitate to take what they want from their unsuspecting victims by any and all means.</p>
<p>But surely, even among Friedmanites, it must be allowed that some things cannot be commodified or bought and sold. For instance, clean air and potable water are the birthright of every living organism. These are necessities that belong to the commons; they cannot ethically be privately owned. In contrast to this assertion, two edicts of modern capitalism are private ownership and the commodification of workers and nature.</p>
<p>Capitalism, and the market fundamentalism that is associated with it, has stripped bare the Earth’s biodiversity and substituted a world of commodities in its stead. What we see and think we know is not real. It is the product of marketing and perception managers—a hologram.</p>
<p>There is growing conflict between capitalism and the planet’s ecology, its essential life support systems. A fierce struggle between capital and democracy is in progress. The booted foot of capitalism is pressing upon the throat of democracy. We inhabit a dying world and are inheriting dying freedoms. Corporate greed and over-population is the culprit. Conflict is everywhere.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the social upheaval, inequality, and environmental problems of today in some way ensue from capitalism, including overpopulation and armed aggression. Capitalism requires continuous economic expansion and a burgeoning market for consumers. This is simply not possible on a finite planet.</p>
<p>These tensions are manifested no more clearly than throughout the coal belt and mountains of West Virginia, where I make my home. Here, mountains are cleared of forests before being blown to smithereens in order to cheaply extract coal to enrich Massey Energy Corporation. The process, known as mountaintop removal, has poisoned streams, altered their courses, and changed the contours of the land and its hydrology. It has devastated both human and biological communities while filling the coffers of the timber and coal industries.</p>
<p>Conventional underground mining has claimed the lives of thousands of coal miners trying to scratch out a modest living from the Earth. At times, it has led to armed conflict between miners and the Pinkertons hired by the mining companies in places like Matewan and Blair Mountain.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, King Coal and the gas and oil industry run the state’s legislature. The government is effectively owned by corporate lobbyists. As a result, it is futile to make legal and moral appeals to government for redress of our grievances. If we limit ourselves to the tools that our oppressors provide us, the entire region will become a sacrifice zone. Working people and the poor make the sacrifices; billionaires and industry carry off the profit. We are left to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>The illusion of democracy, including voting in the absence of meaningful choice, is a poor substitute for direct action and anarchy. Democracy cannot flourish in the sterile soil that capitalism leaves in its wake. Either we have democracy or we have capitalism, or we create something entirely different. Radically opposing ideas cannot be reconciled.</p>
<p>Modern humans inhabit a human-engineered world of absurdities and contradictions. Regardless of the Supreme Court’s assertions, corporations are not people, and money is not speech. Every sentient human being knows this. However, the law says otherwise. We must deny the corporate state that victory by refusing to capitulate.</p>
<p>The struggle for community rights, egalitarianism, and social, economic, and environmental justice must occur outside of the system that creates inequality and fosters wanton destruction of the commons. Countless species of plants and animals that provide essential ecological services are being eliminated to create space for strip malls, gated communities, gambling casinos and golf courses. As a result, ecological and economic catastrophe loom. We are facing global famine in an anthropocentric over-heated world.</p>
<p>Globally, wealthy multi-national corporations are gorging themselves on the biological and mineral wealth of the commons. What could be more absurd or unethical?</p>
<p>The brainchild of Adam Smith, capitalism, which replaced feudalism during the French Revolution, is founded upon demonstrably false premises, many of which were unknown in Smith’s time. Nevertheless, classically-trained economists assert that capitalism is a primal force of nature rather than the defective human construct that it is. Modern capitalism has produced pathological symptoms and endorsed an ethos that is antithetical to life and to liberty. It is killing the world and foreclosing evolutionary possibilities.</p>
<p>Indeed, ethical considerations aside, and speaking purely from a biological perspective, one may emphatically state that modern capitalism is an aggressive cancer that is devouring its host. But most of us are in denial. People like me are asked not to utter the “C” word in public spaces. It might offend the well-intentioned believers. Whenever this occurs I am reminded of Thoreau, who uttered, “Any truth is better than make believe.” One has an ethical obligation to state what one knows succinctly and clearly.</p>
<p>It is not in dispute that the ideology of constant expansion on a finite planet is contradicted by inviolable ecological dictums—among them, carrying capacity, ecological overshoot, and die-off. But classical economists act as if these laws do not apply, or they are mysteriously overridden by the irrational exuberance of capitalism.</p>
<p>In reality, every political economy is underlain by ecology and by living, evolving, biological systems. Ecology is the only economy that really matters.</p>
<p>By possessing even a modest degree of ecological literacy, one can make some revealing predictions with mathematical certainty. For example, the continuation of capitalism as the primary political economy can have one of two possible outcomes: the virtual destruction of the biosphere, meaning the death of the host organism, or the abolition of the capitalist system.</p>
<p>What would a post-capitalism world look like and how might it work?</p>
<p>Global capitalism, with its dependence on the availability of cheap fossil fuels and petrochemicals for food production, must give way to small-scale local economies and organic agriculture. Food must be locally grown and, as far as possible, other necessities locally produced. The age of cheap fossil fuels is ending. Industrialized man must bravely confront his addictions and embrace sobriety or he will self-destruct.</p>
<p>It is said that nature bats last. Humans do best when they emulate natural systems that have evolved over eons of time.</p>
<p>A moneyless economy based upon need must supplant the current profit-driven system of exploitation. Accordingly, goods and services may then be exchanged without the conduit of markets. These exchanges would be of equal value and thus inherently fair.</p>
<p>The classic business models will be replaced by worker-owned and worker-operated cooperatives. In this arrangement, workers—not a board of directors—make all of the business decisions. They share the risks and benefits and distribute the surpluses of production, while significantly reducing the work day and the work week. A portion of the surpluses of production is allocated to the betterment of the community and to the protection of the commons.</p>
<p>New economic models must be predicated upon ecological principles or they will fail. Existing alternatives to capitalism, such as Spain’s Mondragon Worker Cooperative, must be critically analyzed and evaluated as a model that could, with modifications, be implemented elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is no better teacher than evolution and natural selection. History confirms that the most revolutionary ideas are occasionally the oldest. For instance, anthropological studies indicate that early Homo sapiens evolved by implementing egalitarian principles into their tribal clans. People and the cultures they create must either evolve or perish.</p>
<p>The egalitarian societies of the future will look radically different from the capitalism of today. Political campaigns and elections will recede into history and quickly forgotten. Evolved societies do not need leaders or elected officials.</p>
<p>Every member of an egalitarian community is a leader. Power flows in a circular form rather than a linear, top-down hierarchy. It is derived directly from the people. There will be no social or economic stratification. No one shall have privileges or rights that are denied to others. Every member of the community must be equally empowered and equally valued. All people will have equal access to opportunity. Healthcare and higher education, like pure water and clean air, will be regarded as a right of birth and provided without cost.</p>
<p>Direct action will replace voting in political elections. Rather than consent to be governed, sovereign people can create the world they want to live in. In communities where people are empowered and where they have an equal stake, they will want to participate. Everyone brings something to the table. Everyone contributes and all of society benefits.</p>
<p>Communities will become as interconnected and interdependent as ecological systems. But each will remain autonomous within the larger matrix of nature. States and nations as we know them may eventually recede into history and disappear.</p>
<p>Rather than the callous competition and exploitation nurtured by capitalism, communities can be organized around the principle of cooperation and social need. As in healthy ecosystems, the welfare of the individual is dependent upon the well-being of the community—and vice versa. No one will be left behind. All of us shall rise together.</p>
<p>All living organisms share a common origin and a common destiny. Ecology and economy must merge into an integrated natural system suited to long-term survival in a world already ravaged by industrialized man. Ecological and social healing must be part of the process of building sustainable communities.</p>
<p>The transition from capitalism to cooperation will be neither smooth nor easy. There will be many false starts. At first, there will be fierce resistance to revolutionary change. People cling to the familiar and the comfortable, to what they know, even when the dominant paradigm and popular culture does them harm.</p>
<p>The first tentative steps of a journey are often the most difficult. There are no clear blueprints to follow. There will be trepidation and uncertainty. But we must commit to beginning. The alternative is oblivion. But if we embark on the voyage the survival of the species, and a new age of enlightenment will be possible.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Nikola-Tesla-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Nikola-Tesla-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a><em>&#8216;Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe. Throughout space there is energy.</em>  &#8212; Nikola Tesla, 1892<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death.  Was he for real? A crackpot? Part of an early experiment in corporate-government control?</p>
<p>We know that he was undoubtedly persecuted by the energy power brokers of his day &#8212; namely Thomas Edison, whom we are taught in school to revere as a genius.  He was also attacked by J.P. Morgan and other &#8220;captains of industry.&#8221; Upon Tesla&#8217;s death on January 7th, 1943, the U.S. government moved into his lab and apartment confiscating all of his scientific research, and to this day none of this research has been made public.</p>
<p>Besides his persecution by corporate-government interests (which is practically a certification of authenticity), there is at least one solid indication of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s integrity &#8212; he tore up a contract with Westinghouse that was worth billions in order to save the company from paying him his huge royalty payments.</p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s take a look at what Nikola Tesla &#8212; a man who died broke and alone &#8212; has actually given to the world.  For better or worse, with credit or without, he changed the face of the planet in ways that perhaps no man ever has.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><strong>1. Alternating Current</strong> &#8211; This is where it all began, and what ultimately caused such a stir at the 1893 World&#8217;s Expo in Chicago.  A war was leveled ever-after between the vision of Edison and the vision of Tesla for how electricity would be produced and distributed.  The division can be summarized as one of cost and safety: The DC current that Edison (backed by General Electric) had been working on was costly over long distances, and produced dangerous sparking from the required converter (called a commutator).  Regardless, Edison and his backers utilized the general &#8220;dangers&#8221; of electric current to instill fear in Tesla&#8217;s alternative: Alternating Current.  As proof, Edison sometimes electrocuted animals at demonstrations.  Consequently, Edison gave the world the electric chair, while simultaneously maligning Tesla&#8217;s attempt to offer safety at a lower cost.  Tesla responded by demonstrating that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting current through his own body to produce light.  This Edison-Tesla (GE-Westinghouse) feud in 1893 was the culmination of over a decade of shady business deals, stolen ideas, and patent suppression that Edison and his moneyed interests wielded over Tesla&#8217;s inventions. Yet, despite it all, it is Tesla&#8217;s system that provides power generation and distribution to North America in our modern era.</p>
<p><strong>2. Light </strong>&#8211; Of course he didn&#8217;t invent light itself, but he did invent how light can be harnessed and distributed.  Tesla developed and used florescent bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry &#8220;invented&#8221; them. At the World&#8217;s Fair, Tesla took glass tubes and bent them into famous scientists&#8217; names, in effect creating the first neon signs.  However, it is his Tesla Coil that might be the most impressive, and controversial.  The Tesla Coil is certainly something that big industry would have liked to suppress: the concept that the Earth itself is a magnet that can generate electricity (electromagnetism) utilizing frequencies as a transmitter.  All that is needed on the other end is the receiver &#8212; much like a radio.</p>
<p><strong>3. X-rays &#8211; </strong>Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the late 1800s, but Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a precursor to <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/kirlian-photography-shows-organic.html">Kirlian photography</a>, which has the ability to document life force, to what we now use in medical diagnostics, this was a transformative invention of which Tesla <a href="http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/28/4/1189.full">played a central role</a>.  X-rays, like so many of Tesla&#8217;s contributions, stemmed from his belief that everything we need to understand the universe is virtually around us at all times, but we need to use our minds to develop real-world devices to augment our innate perception of existence.</p>
<p><strong>4. Radio</strong> &#8211; Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him to be the inventor of radio to this day.  However, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi&#8217;s patent in 1943, when it was proven that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi.  Radio signals are just another frequency that needs a transmitter and receiver, which Tesla also demonstrated in 1893 during a presentation before The National Electric Light Association.  In 1897 Tesla applied for two patents <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US645576" rel="nofollow"> US 645576</a>, and <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US649621" rel="nofollow">US 649621</a>. In 1904, however, The U.S. Patent Office reversed its decision, awarding Marconi a patent for the invention of radio, possibly influenced by Marconi&#8217;s financial backers in the States, who included Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie. This also allowed the U.S. government (among others) to avoid having to pay the royalties that were being claimed by Tesla.</p>
<p><strong>5. Remote Control</strong> &#8211; This invention was a natural outcropping of radio. Patent No.<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=0613809.PN.&amp;OS=PN/0613809&amp;RS=PN/0613809">613809</a> was the first remote controlled model boat, demonstrated in 1898.  Utilizing several large batteries; radio signals controlled switches, which then energized the boat&#8217;s propeller, rudder, and scaled-down running lights. While this exact technology was not widely used for some time, we now can see the power that was appropriated by the military in its pursuit of <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/6-technologies-for-de-humanizing-war.html">remote controlled war</a>. Radio controlled tanks were introduced by the Germans in WWII, and developments in this realm have since slid quickly away from the direction of human freedom.</p>
<p><strong>6. Electric Motor &#8211; </strong>Tesla&#8217;s invention of the electric motor has finally been popularized by <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">a car</a> brandishing his name.  While the technical specifications are beyond the scope of this summary, suffice to say that Tesla&#8217;s invention of a motor with rotating magnetic fields could have freed mankind much sooner from the stranglehold of Big Oil.  However, his invention in 1930 succumbed to the economic crisis and the world war that followed. Nevertheless, this invention has fundamentally changed the landscape of what we now take for granted: industrial fans, household applicances, water pumps, machine tools, power tools, disk drives, electric wristwatches and compressors.</p>
<p><strong>7. Robotics</strong> &#8211; Tesla&#8217;s overly enhanced scientific mind led him to the idea that all living beings are merely driven by external impulses.  He stated: &#8220;I have by every thought and act of mine, demonstrated, and does so daily, to my absolute satisfaction that I am an automaton endowed with power of movement, which merely responds to external stimuli.&#8221;  Thus, the concept of the robot was born.  However, an element of the human remained present, as Tesla asserted that these human replicas should have limitations &#8212; namely growth and propagation. Nevertheless, Tesla unabashedly embraced all of what intelligence could produce.  His visions for a future filled with intelligent cars, robotic human companions, and the use of sensors, and autonomous systems are detailed in a must-read entry in the <a href="http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=1451-48690603163V">Serbian Journal of Electrical Engineering, 2006 (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8. Laser</strong> &#8211; Tesla&#8217;s invention of the laser may be one of the best examples of the good and evil bound up together within the mind of man.  Lasers have transformed surgical applications in an undeniably beneficial way, and they have given rise to much of our current digital media. However, with this leap in innovation we have also crossed into the land of science fiction.  From Reagan&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; laser defense system to today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/12/orwellian-non-lethal-war-waged-against.html">Orwellian &#8220;non-lethal&#8221; weapons&#8217;</a> arsenal, which includes laser rifles and directed energy &#8220;death rays,&#8221; there is great potential for development in both directions.</p>
<p><strong>9 and 10. Wireless Communications and Limitless Free Energy</strong> &#8211; These two are inextricably linked, as they were the last straw for the power elite &#8212; what good is energy if it can&#8217;t be metered and controlled?  Free?  Never.  J.P. Morgan backed Tesla with $150,000 to build a tower that would use the natural frequencies of our universe to transmit data, including a wide range of information communicated through images, voice messages, and text.  This represented the world&#8217;s first wireless communications, but it also meant that aside from the cost of the tower itself, the universe was filled with free energy that could be utilized to form a world wide web connecting all people in all places, as well as allow people to harness the free energy around them.  Essentially, the 0&#8242;s and 1&#8242;s of the universe are embedded in the fabric of existence for each of us to access as needed.  Nikola Tesla was dedicated to empowering the individual to receive and transmit this data virtually free of charge.  But we know the ending to that story . . . until now?</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" alt="" align="left" />Tesla had perhaps thousands of other ideas and inventions that remain unreleased.  A look at his <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yvwev4">hundreds of patents</a> shows a glimpse of the scope he intended to offer.  If you feel that the additional technical and scientific research of Nikola Tesla should be revealed for public scrutiny and discussion, instead of suppressed by big industry and even our supposed <a href="http://poorrichards-blog.blogspot.com/2011/12/history-of-mits-blatant-suppression-of.html">institutions of higher education</a>, please <strong><a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/%21/petition/release-nikola-teslas-technical-and-scientific-research/S9CjXwh5">sign this petition</a></strong> to demand that power brokers everywhere learn that we are ready to Occupy Energy and learn about what our universe really has to offer.</p>
<p>The release of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s technical and scientific research &#8212; specifically his research into harnessing electricity from the ionosphere at a facility called Wardenclyffe &#8212; is a necessary step toward true freedom of information.  The petition has a goal of 25,000 signatures and needs your support, but whether or not it is reached please continue to add your voice by sharing this information with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>A Facebook event page for the official call on January 7th, the anniversary of Tesla&#8217;s death, can be found here:  <a title="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332" dir="ltr" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332</a></p>
<p>For additional information about the demand for release, please visit:<a title="http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/" dir="ltr" href="http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/</a></p>
<p>As they state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tell your friends, bring it up and discuss it at your next general assembly, do whatever you can to get the word out, organize locally to make a stand for the release of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s research&#8230;. America is tired of corrupt corporate greed, supported by The American government, holding us back in a stagnant society in the name of profit . . . The Energy Crisis is a lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an aside: there are some who have pointed out that Tesla&#8217;s experimentation with the ionosphere very well could have caused the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~onichelson/ONichelsonTUNGUSKA.pdf">massive explosion over Tunguska, Siberia in 1908,</a> which leveled an estimated 60 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers, and may even have led to the much maligned <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/08/weather-wars-and-devils-haarp.html">HAARP</a> technology.  I submit that we would do well to remember that technology is never the true enemy; it is the <em>misuse</em> of technology that can enslave rather than free mankind from its animal-level survivalism.</p>
<p>Please view the video below, which does an excellent job at personalizing this largely forgotten human being, as well as show the reasons why to this day he is not a household name.</p>

<p>And here is a video that offers an essential alternative view of ancient Egypt and other cultures that employed pyramidal structures, which suggests the staggering outer limits of what Tesla was attempting to harness and offer to humanity:</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/2012earth3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/2012earth2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>At the dawning of 2012, Americans made resolutions and wish lists for themselves and their families.   Americans plan to lose weight, obtain a job, bring a child into the world, save an animal, volunteer for the environment and dozens of other resolutions to make this a better world.</p>
<p>We Americans make plans by joining organizations, forming groups and collectively working toward bettering our own lives and communities.</p>
<p>In many ways, “The Doctors”, “The Biggest Losers” , “Dr. Oz”, “The Nature Conservancy” , “The Center for Biological Diversity”, “American Cancer  Society”, “<a href="http://www.EvolvingWisdom.com">www.Evolving Wisdom.com</a>” and hundreds of people and organizations attempt to make our world better for today and into the future.</p>
<p>It’s about interconnectivity, synchronicities and the common good.  It’s about caring what happens to our civilization.   It’s about caring for the future and our children. It’s about the 7<sup>th</sup> generation to come.  As we walk across the land today and our treatment of that land, we walk on the faces of future children yet to be born.</p>
<p>It’s about moving away from “what can I gain and how rich can I become and how much can I screw the taxpayers” to “what can I do to make America better.”</p>
<p>It’s time our Congress, that possesses all the power in the world, to make for a better America and 535 members need to get their collective heads out of their rear ends and start working together to bring jobs to America, work for the environment, enforce our laws,  work for American citizens and our betterment in the world.  We need a president that cares about our country and not side with other countries as Obama has done.  We need a president that takes care of our needs, homes, jobs, education and futures—instead of rebuilding other countries.  Invest in our infrastructure, schools, medical facilities and environment.</p>
<p>Why does this Congress continue insourcing, outsourcing and offshoring millions of jobs when we suffer 15 million unemployed and 46 million Americans subsisting on food stamps?    Why does this Congress continue pumping 100,000 legal green card holding immigrants into this country every 30 days when we haven’t employed our own citizens?  Why does this Congress allow a $700 billion annual trade deficit when we need to bring manufacturing jobs back to America?  Why continue two wars that mean and have done absolutely nothing to protect or give any form of security to America and cost us over $1 trillion along with the blood of our children?</p>
<p>Do any of those questions make sense?  Do the members of Congress make sense?  The answer:  citizens give 535 congressional critters a nine percent approval rating. You cannot help but wonder what that nine percent uses for brains. Obama languishes at 46 percent approval.  They fact is: both Congress and Obama fail abysmally.  But notice most of them are filthy rich and secure.</p>
<p>Does this wish list for America make sense?  If so, send it to your senators and house reps.</p>
<p>1.    Get out of Afghanistan and Iraq completely.  It’s killing our finest young men and women, and slaughtering our financial wellbeing at $12 billion monthly.  The long term costs grow more appalling by the day.  According to BATR writer, Dan Froomkin, “December 30, 2011 &#8220;<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/" target="_blank">Information Clearing House</a>&#8221; - Reports about the end of the war in Iraq routinely describe the toll on the U.S. military: 4,487 dead, and 32,226 wounded. But the wounded figure wildly understates the number of American service members who have come back from Iraq less than whole.  The true number of military personnel injured over the course of our nine-year-long fiasco in Iraq is in the hundreds of thousands—maybe even more than a half million—if you take into account all the men and women who returned from their deployments with traumatic brain injuries, post traumatic stress, depression, hearing loss, breathing disorders, diseases and other long term health problems.”</p>
<p>2.      We need to change “free” trade to “fair” trade. That means we buy $1 billion from the Chinese, Indians, Mexico and other countries—and they buy $1 billion worth of goods from us.  It will balance our trade to equity and give our citizens jobs at living wages.</p>
<p>3.      We need to stop insourcing, offshoring and outsourcing American jobs in order to employ our 15 million unemployed American workers from all arenas.  Our Congress must stop allowing H-1b, H-2b, L-1 and other work visas that take jobs from Americans.  It’s sickening as to the fraud of it now going on within our own corporations that use America as a “selling” base, but displace American workers out of jobs—for obscene profits.</p>
<p>4.      We must move beyond “comprehensive immigration reform” to a total moratorium on all immigration.  If we continue at our current importation of third world citizens with their line of desperate individuals that grows by 80 million annually, we will add 100 million people within the next 23 years. We’re already 12 to 15 million into that number.  We cannot sustain another 100 million Americans at the current level of carbon footprint, water footprint, ecological footprint, resource usage and energy consumption. I defy anyone to argue with my logic and the facts.   We cannot EVER hope to continue the American Dream or lifestyle if we allow ourselves to become massively overpopulated.  Our entire civilization hangs in the balance.  We must stabilize our population with the “carrying capacity” of our finite continent.</p>
<p><em>“Most Western elites continue urging the wealthy West not to stem the migrant tide [that adds 80 million net gain annually to the planet], but to absorb our global brothers and sisters until their horrid ordeal has been endured and shared by all—ten billion humans packed onto an ecologically devastated planet.” Dr. Otis Graham, Unguarded Gates</em></p>
<p>5.      We must engage every science and technology to promote alternative energy at every level as quickly as possible.  As our oil and natural gas energy depletes, and imported supplies diminish, we will not be able to operate and feed this 315 million-sized country.</p>
<p><em>“As we go from this happy hydrocarbon bubble we have reached now to a renewable energy resource economy, which we do this century, will the “civil” part of civilization survive?  As we both know there is no way that alternative energy sources can supply the amount of per capita energy we enjoy now, much less for the 9 billion expected by 2050. And energy is what keeps this game going. We are involved in a Faustian bargain—selling our economic souls for the luxurious life of the moment, but sooner or later the price has to be paid.”  Walter Youngquist, energy  </em></p>
<p>6.      We must engage a massive conservation and clean water program to save our ground water from continuing contamination and ultimately, not enough water for our citizens, animals and irrigation for our crops.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>7.      We must move from unlimited capitalistic growth that consumes our natural world and devastates millions of other species—and move toward “Steady State Economics” whereby we produce and consume within the boundaries of our carrying capacity.  (Source:<a href="http://www.steadystatet.org/" target="_blank">www.SteadyStatet.org</a> )<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>8.      We must turn our financial resources to educate our very illiterate and marginal intellectual young adult citizenry.  We suffer dropout rates of 50 to 76 percent across the USA.  We cannot and will not maintain a viable civilization with so many ignorant, dumb, illiterate and useless citizens that live on welfare.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>9.      We need to codify and institute the English language as the only language of our  civilization in order to maintain our identity, our culture and our country.  No more alternative language on TV or radio stations. No more documents in any other language other than English.  Repeal Executive Order 12166 by former President Clinton. It is destructive and costly to our country.  And, no more hyphenated Americans.  If you are a citizen of America, you are an American, period.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>10.     We Americans, or what’s left of us, must participate in our constitutional republic or we’re in the process of losing it.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>Fellow Americans, we are in serious and deep trouble today.  I am willing to bet that if we fail to engage this 10 point wish list, as well as another 20-30 items you could name, our country will continue its decline into economic poverty, loss of freedom and personal rights, environmental destruction, loss of quality of life, severe drop in standard of living and linguistic and cultural chaos.  It’s already well on its way.  If we continue on this current path, given another 10 to 20 years tops, I doubt we will enjoy a country—but instead, a polyglot of poverty that mirrors much of the third world today.  It’s our choice and I am not optimistic given our track record, apathy and corporate greed for the past 20 years.</p>

			<p><strong>The Elections Are Much Ado About Very Little&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/romneyperry3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/romneyperry2.jpg" alt="" /></a>Americans have been skillfully imbued with idea that the United States of America is the world’s greatest country; it has the most freedom, the best government, the best judicial system, the most inventive people, the best industry, the best morals, a superior social order, a more righteous citizenship, the most wealth, the best athletes, etc.  They sincerely believe in a paternal approach to the world and cling to the hope that voting will provide leadership that will keep us free, righteous, and above all, dominate.</p>
<p>Fred Reed puts it this way: “If I were to speechify to a conclave of Tea Partyers, “America is the free-est&#8230;the most democratic&#8230;the best educated and most dynamic country the world has ever known, an example to all mankind,” the assembled would hoot and hooroar and applaud in dizzy exaltation.  Here is the soul of the American approach to existence, bottomless self-admiration devoid of knowledge or curiosity, wrapped like a psychic burrito in the patriotism of overwrought middle-schoolers. And there are many, many of them.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Our system of government is not perfect but it is the best the world has to offer.&#8221;  Some semblance of this idea has been afloat in America for decades.   Every four years we elect a president.  It is a raucous, mendacious process that has become progressively manipulated.   While there is overt accountability of funding for political candidates there is evidence that candidates are preselected and that their campaigns are financed under the table.  Several high level politicians attended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group" target="_blank">Bilderberg</a> meetings before finding political success.  Obama and Clinton were both knighted at these meetings; so were Romney and Perry.  Friendly former English leader Tony Blair was in attendance before becoming Prime Minister. Large political donations frequently go under the radar.  <a href="http://news.muckety.com/2010/01/29/heiress-bunny-mellon-plays-unlikely-role-in-edwards-sex-scandal/24011" target="_blank">The details</a> of John Edward’s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/03/john-edwards-indicted_n_867406.html" target="_blank">indictment</a>  provide a glimpse into some of this skullduggery.</p>
<p>Legislation must always be introduced by an elected official but most of the important legislation passed by the House and Senate is written elsewhere.  Lobbyists write legislation which is entered in bill form by willing legislators.  Complicated world government bills like NAFTA, GATT, and CAFTA are written by members of the CFR or other like minded individuals.  The legislation for creating Homeland Security was written long before 9/11/2001 and was withheld to be introduced at that propitious time.  Congress no longer declares war, it no longer cuts off funding to projects that have lost public support, it no longer writes its own legislation, it is a pompous, <a href="http://www.wallstreetwatch.org/reports/part2.pdf" target="_blank">bought and paid for</a> organization catering to pernicious outside influences that are destroying the country.</p>
<p>It isn’t Medicare and Social Security that is bankrupting our nation; it isn’t even the immoral wars though they account for a terrible moral decline.  What is destroying America is the New World Order.  It is the shifting of manufacturing to China and other third world nations and the open border policies that accompany cultural amalgamation.  These policies emerge from the international banking cabal and are intended to wealth down America.  No one does better at covering that ground than Dr. Daneen Peterson &#8211; set aside some time and <a href="http://www.stopthenorthamericanunion.com/TreasonAbounds.html" target="_blank">read about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Demonstrations against corporate greed may siphon off some of the angst but they miss the target and will be of no more use in correcting the problem than the election of another president.  The dilemma is centered in our dependence on money which has been under the control of a hidden banking cabal for centuries.  Both political parties including their presidential leaders are controlled by the same financial cabal.</p>
<p>Ron Paul is correct in indicting the Federal Reserve but even if the United States could get out from under this tyrannical power center it would be a lonely nation because all of the major nations of the world have central banks and the control structure would still be in place.  The Rothschild family was involved in financing wars two hundred years ago when the world was primarily agrarian.  Now that the industrial revolution has created a mass producing world economy the scope of financial power covers much of the world population.  Control of the money provides control over the necessities of life.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid financial tyranny is to eliminate the need for money by becoming independent; being able to provide the necessities of life without resorting to a medium of exchange.  The world financial cabal is working to prevent this by monopolizing the food supply, by controlling seeds, water, and fertile land.  If these efforts are successful the world will become a large plantation populated by serfs whose sustenance is controlled and allotted by an elite cadre</p>
<p>This morning’s newspaper pictured Romney and Perry as the leading presidential candidates.   That article mentioned that Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, a Christie backer, had joined Romney along with John Catsimatidis, a supermarket executive, Paul Singer of hedge fund fame, and Jim Nicholson, former Republican National Committee Chairman. According the article Perry also picked up some Christie support and is positioned to pick up Palin backers.  One would assume from this article that the backing of corporate moguls and wealthy elitists is decisive in political success.  The movers and shakers have no loyalty to their primary choices, they switch horses without hesitation. The voting public has little to do with the choice of candidates; that choice is controlled by money and power – not substance.  See the candidates that are being ignored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Proud people believe they have a right to win.  They are competitive to a fault.  Vietnam veterans suffered some of that proud spirit when their coming home was marred by the disdain of civilian sore losers.  Only winners are heroes.  Winning is everything – that is the proud America way.  There was a time when Americans had a right to be proud of our nation.  We were free, benevolent, and righteous.  Unfortunately righteousness has succumbed to ugliness and even our victories are without honor.  Killing an American citizen in the Middle East by presidential order with a guided missile controlled from a U. S. Air Force base in Creech, Nevada, produces no heroes.  It is technically advanced but illegal and cowardly.</p>
<p>The media runs polls which determine the popularity of presidential candidates and the convention then nominates the most popular in an attempt to win the election.   The polls, which are controlled by the media, determine which candidate gets the nomination.</p>
<p>One thing is certain:  In the coming presidential election there will not be an honorable vote available on the ballot.  As has been the case for several decades our nation and our people will suffer for the policies enacted by either candidate because these men do not work for the benefit of our nation and its people, they are beholden to a bold and powerful evil that seeks dominion over the Universe.</p>
<p>Pride cometh before a fall!  Teetering at the precipice Americans remain a proud people.</p>
<p>It is time for American citizens to <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/peters-e/peters-e102.html" target="_blank">stop voting for candidates that do not represent us</a>, that are destroying our assets and stealing our freedom.</p>

			<p>American hospitals have devised a scheme to guarantee they never get stuck with an unpaid bill.  It’s called guardianship.</p>
<p>Thinking of checking into a hospital?  Think again.  You may never see home again.</p>
<ul>
<li> Ginger Franklin,Hendersonville,Tennessee, fell down the stairs in her condo and suffered a bump on her head.  She was declared “temporarily mentally incapacitated” and a guardian was appointed through the courts.  <a href="http://www.wsmv.com/story/15205936/woman-files-complaint-against-judge#.TlSfAuCedMY.blogger">Within six weeks, the guardian had soldFranklin’s home, car, furniture, and drained her bank account</a>.  Today,Franklin has her freedom back, but she is having to start all over.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Michael Kidd, 72, of Richardson,Texas, fell in his yard and broke a hip.  Now, he is living in Countryside Nursing Home with his wife.  Both were removed from their home when the state of Texas petitioned the courts claiming that the Kidds were mentally incompetent.  Their house sits vacant and neglected, with rotting food still remaining in the refrigerator.  The Kidds have been confined to a single room in the nursing home, while the state appointed guardian burns through their money an gives them a mere $60 a month spending allowance which they have been using to buy “real” food.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KhRSHoH_u4&amp;feature=related" target="_blank"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3KhRSHoH_u4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=window" frameborder="0" width="500" height="312"></iframe></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Robert Milton (not his real name) was taken to the hospital because he fell “one time too many” at his home, and although his stepson had been given power of attorney to make all of his health care decisions, a court-appointed corporate guardian placed Milton against his will in a nursing home where he is now isolated from his family and friends.  Meanwhile, his money is being spent as quickly as possible by the Orlando-based guardian and her attorneys.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How It Commences</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Niedesky (not his real name) was air lifted to a hospital in Orlando from Ocalaby helicopter after he was the victim of a motorcycle crash.  But something went terribly wrong during Niedesky’s surgery and he aspirated on his own vomit, causing some brain injury.  That’s when a corporate guardian was contacted by the hospital and appointed by the court as Niedesky’s full plenary, permanent guardian.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens Next</strong></p>
<p>The corporate guardian who petitioned the court stated in the court papers that Niedesky had no family.  In reality, Niedesky had been married for more than 20 years and had four teenage children.  It took more than two months for Niedesky’s wife to discover what had happened to her husband and where he was located.</p>
<p><strong>The Family is Always Portrayed as the “Devil Incarnate”</strong></p>
<p>What happened to Niedesky is becoming a commonplace occurrence in America.  A family member is rushed to the hospital.  Surgery occurs and something sometimes goes terribly wrong.  However, by quickly petitioning the courts for guardianship, the hospital avoids any kind of lawsuit for negligence or wrongful death.  Niedesky’s wife wanted to bring him home and get him out of the guardianship.  The guardian, however, kept moving Niedesky from location to location, city to city, until the statute of limitations for suing the hospital had expired.  Shortly after the statute of limitations ended, Niedsky just happened to die.</p>
<p>“The hospital saved itself millions in a lawsuit.  It is typical that shortly after the statute of limitations runs out, the ward just happens to suddenly die,” stated David Newman, Gainesville, Florida, a civil rights guardianship reform advocate.</p>
<p>Niedesky’s wife was portrayed in the court record as uncaring, incompetent, over-meddling, and negligent, and although these descriptors seem to be a contraction of terms, you will typically find the most cynical descriptions of family members in most court files where an involuntary guardianship has been granted by the courts to a total stranger.</p>
<p>For example, inMilton’s case,Milton’s stepson had been named long ago as his power of attorney and health care surrogate.  That designation, however, was destroyed by the court and the corporate guardian even accused the stepson of stealing several thousands over the years from his stepfather.  Today, Milton’s stepson, a 65 year old retired veteran, finds himself in a legal nightmare gathering bank records and hiring attorneys and forensic accountants to prove his innocence.  Meanwhile, the corporate guardian is spending Milton’s money like water.</p>
<p><strong>The Other Scenario</strong></p>
<p>Tom Griffith (not his real name) wonders why an Orlando-based corporate guardian would be interested in his father at all.</p>
<p>“He has no money.  All he gets is a small monthly cheque from Social Security of about $800.00.”</p>
<p>I explained to Griffith that his father has been marked for destruction and will mostly likely not be among the living in a very short period of time.  “We live in a country that is ruled by corporations, not the U.S. Constitution.  If there is not enough money for the nursing home to cover its expenses, there is ‘no reason’ to keep your father alive.”  I explained to Milton how Thomas Chada’s father was sent to him as a box of ashes and how other wards seem to always turn up “expired” shortly after a corporate guardian and her attorneys have burned through all of an elderly person’s money.</p>
<p>But in this case,Griffith said there was no reason to destroy his father.  “There is no money to gain.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but that is the point.  The corporate guardians have a symbiotic relationship with the nursing homes.  Sometimes, the nursing home gives them a wealthy resident that they can bilk.  At other times, the corporate guardian does them a favor by making premature end-of-life decisions when there is not enough finances to cover the elderly person’s day-to-day expenses.”</p>
<p>In the case of Griffith’s father, who just received quadruple open heart bypass surgery, it was determined that the ward, age 74, now needed dialysis, a very costly ongoing treatment.</p>
<p>“The doctors said my father does not want dialysis,”Milton stated.  “But I know my father wishes to live; he is only 74.”</p>
<p>“They probably got your father to sign such a statement without him even knowing what he was signing,” I explained.</p>
<p>Miltonwanted to know what he could do to rescue his father out of this dangerous and life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>“You can hire an attorney, but you might end up spending more than $500,000.00 of your own money to become your father’s guardian.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have that kind of money,”Griffithdeclared, shocked.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the scenario I was describing was greatly upsetting Griffith.   Those of us who have already lived this scenario remember going through the predictable stage of “mental shock” followed by the overwhelming urge to seek justice—at any cost.  I explained to Griffith that he may find himself bankrupt as a result of trying to help his father out of this doomed guardianship situation.</p>
<p>My phone continues to ring as victims, desperate to find a solution, want to know what they can do.</p>
<p>In a country that is ruled by corporations and corporate greed, there will be no solution to The Guardianship Nightmare until a public uprising is so severe that these kinds of abominable– yet commonplace situations– will no longer be able to occur.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Craigroseinteeth2.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Craigroseinteeth2.jpg" alt="" /></a>While we are coming to recognize the acts of individual, lone psychopaths in crime, business, politics and our personal lives as the source of tremendous trauma, and the monetary costs, arguably in the trillions today, we have failed to grasp the full magnitude of the problem.</p>
<p>As with all other segments of the population psychopaths run the spectrum of abilities and intelligent. According to Dr. Liane Leedom, a psychiatrist specializing in the study of the condition, at any time there are 20,000 psychopaths with IQs over 180 at large in the United States. This is cause for an entirely different degree of concern for several related reasons.</p>
<p>First, the condition is not presently curable or even treatable. It is a neurological, not psychological condition.</p>
<p>Professor Declan Murphy and colleagues Dr Michael Craig and Dr Marco Catani from the Institute of Psychiatry at King&#8217;s College London have now published findings which move further in the direction of placing the source psychopathy as an organic malfunction of the brain itself. Differences in the brains of normal individuals and psychopaths point to this conclusion.</p>
<p>Dr Michael Craig said in an article published August 5, 2009 in Science News, ”<em>If replicated by larger studies the significance of these findings cannot be underestimated. The suggestion of a clear structural deficit in the brains of psychopaths has profound implications for clinicians, research scientists and the criminal justice system.</em>”</p>
<p>While Dr Craig did not dismiss the possibility for treatment all attempts to change behavior from the use of psychotherapy have failed utterly, professionals admit. Therapeutic approaches have only succeeded in producing more predatory psychopaths.</p>
<p>(Jan. 25, 2011) — People diagnosed as psychopathic have difficulty showing empathy, just like patients who have suffered frontal head injury. This has been shown in a new study from the University of Haifa. &#8220;<em>Our findings show that people who have psychopathic symptoms behave as though they are suffering frontal brain damage,</em>&#8221; said Dr. Simone Shamay-Tsoory, who conducted the study.</p>
<p>Psychopathy is a personality disorder that finds expression in extreme anti-social behavior and intentional harm to others, including a lack of compassion and empathy. An existing explanation for such behavior suggests the inability to comprehend the existence of emotions in others. However, the fact that many psychopaths act with sophistication and deceit to intentionally harm others, indicates that they actually have a good grasp of the mental capacity of others &#8212; and are capable of using that knowledge in order to cause them harm.</p>
<p>Earlier research by Dr. Shamay-Tsoory has examined individuals with frontal head injury, i.e., damage to parts of the brain that are responsible for emotional functioning. She has shown that people suffering this type of brain damage have difficulty showing empathy. Having observed similar emotional deficiency in psychopathic behavior, she set out to see if there is in fact a similarity between the two cases.</p>
<p>The current study assessed 17 people who had been diagnosed by psychiatrists as psychopathic &#8212; and not suffering from any known brain damage; and another 25 individuals suffering frontal lobe injury. Each of the participants underwent a computerized test examining cognitive ability to recognize feelings in another and the ability to demonstrate empathy for another&#8217;s emotions. They were also tested to gauge their capacity to understand another&#8217;s thoughts. The results of these tests showed that both groups demonstrated a similar difficulty in showing empathy, while two control groups of individuals with no known mental disorders or brain damage and individuals with non-frontal brain damage both showed different results with positive empathy capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Seeing as psychopathic behavior is similar to that of a person with brain damage, it could be that it could benefit from similar forms of treatment,</em>&#8221; Dr. Shamay-Tsoory noted, a hopeful note not supported by the body of evidence as of yet.</p>
<p>One psychopath acting alone can alter the behavior of those around him or her though carefully orchestrated manipulation.</p>
<p>What happens when psychopaths cooperate? Is the economic and cultural meltdown now ongoing related to the presence of these individuals, able act at will, in our world? Is this the outcome of psychopaths acting in the “lone wolf” model, or is it an illustration of what happens when psychopaths cooperate? By their nature, intelligent psychopaths are con-men, using our emotions to manipulate us for their own ends to carry out their personal agendas.</p>
<p>There is as yet little awareness of this potentially far more dangerous impact on our lives. The thoughtful might consider stepping back to consider what is taking place today, much of it so seemingly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>The story below is true in all particulars and demonstrates something of the hazards we face in a world which fails to see those without conscience for what they are and enact laws and practices to alleviate the problem.</p>
<p>Craig Franklin and Dan O&#8217;Dowd, cooperating psychopaths within a corporation.</p>
<p>Dan O&#8217;Dowd, President of Green Hills Software, Inc., hired Franklin as Vice President of Advanced Products Development because of his own inability to make a success of his business. At the time Franklin was hired he, Franklin, had facilitated the only sales the company had manged to make since their founding in 1982. Ignoring their marketing materials, Franklin had read the code and recommended the products to three other companies, who, trusting Franklin&#8217;s judgment from experience, bought. In this way Dan was rescued from having to return to their venture capitalist, O&#8217;Dowd&#8217;s former employer, Glenn Hightower, for more funding. As we will see, Dan&#8217;s behavior later identifies him as highly psychopathic himself. Dan&#8217;s goal was to become wealthier than Bill Gates.</p>
<p><strong>Their Story</strong></p>
<p>Craig Franklin is a psychopath whose goals include enjoying incestuous relationships with very young girls or children who looked like his sister, P. Craig&#8217;s first sexual arousal took place when he was 16 and the two siblings were wrestling. Craig&#8217;s sister was then 12. In appearance, the sister, P, was highly neotonous, blond and blue-eyed.</p>
<p>P. was the only girl in a family comprised of four siblings, herself the youngest. The parents were emotionally unavailable and the four siblings were born within just a few years of each other, the first two, Craig and S, only 10 months apart. Not surprisingly, Craig received little maternal attention.</p>
<p>Craig&#8217;s odd behavior was noted by those around him from the time was in grade school.</p>
<p>After a stellar performance in college, where Craig far out performed his peers while obtaining a degree in math at Stanford University in just over three years, Craig went on to do extraordinary work in a series of early software companies. Craig&#8217;s IQ is 180.</p>
<p>However, his inability to cope with normal life, in his case evidenced by his inability to file his income tax returns each year, forced him to move on as soon as the penalties resulted in complete garnishment of his earnings. In fact, Craig never owed money, he made it a practice to have the maximum possible withheld. But he did not file the return. If he had, he would have received a large refund each year. More on Craig&#8217;s non-filing <a href="http://www.rationalreview.com/content/46399">here</a>.</p>
<p>This took place approximately every two years, making it impossible for him to exercise the very generous stock-options he was always granted, by his own report. Craig&#8217;s non-filing cost him hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>As is typical of psychopaths, Craig was profligate with money, spending every penny he had with no thought of the future. As a means of buffering himself in social situations he took up playing the guitar while still in college and began writing his own songs, most of which left the listener cold, as they, not unsurprisingly, were emotionally flat. This changed when he began studying the problem and emulating the emotional content of songs written by others, whose authentic emotions he could express. For years he tried to purchase the right to a song by a fellow Libertarian, Dean Ahmad, about Thomas Jefferson. Dean had written his version on the morning of April 3th, 1976 in honor of Jefferson&#8217;s birthday.</p>
<p>Eventually, Franklin rewrote the song. Franklin told his wife, Melinda, on one occasion, he had to use a huge portion of his left brain to emulate having a right brain (empathy), which he admitted he lacked.</p>
<p>Craig continues to use music to gain access to possibly useful relationships today. These include songs about &#8216;<a href="http://store.theadvocates.org/products/spirit-of-liberty-put-to-music-the-craig-franklin">freedom</a>&#8216; as well as <a href="http://www.tomarketkids.com/press.html">children&#8217;s songs</a>. Those he works with who are probably unaware of Craig&#8217;s history. The <a href="http://celestesingsforkids.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/KidsDream-lyrics.pdf">lyrics</a> appearing in this album, “<a href="http://celestesingsforkids.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/KidsDream-lyrics.pdf">Celeste Sings</a>,” include two examples of Craig&#8217;s writing. Justin&#8217;s Lullaby was written for his youngest son, the other song for his grand-daughter by Scott.</p>
<p>Craig&#8217;s first marriage lasted 18 months, ending because his wife, also a mathematician, insisted their tax returns be filed. The wife, Elaine, was pregnant when Craig abruptly insisted on returning to college for a master&#8217;s degree. She left him. Craig used the divorce and the son born to them in continued attempts to destroy her, apparently unconscious of the effects of his manipulations on the child.</p>
<p>No financial settlement took place until forced by both sets of parents and the court. His son, Scott, became a weapon to continue the war on his former wife, a war in which he maligned her endlessly.</p>
<p>Children are very vulnerable to a psychopathic parent.</p>
<p>While Scott was in his custody he was subjected to endless &#8216;programming&#8217; designed to cause him to distrust and resent his mother. Craig also began to discuss sex with Scott, reflecting the idea he, as a member of his &#8216;very elite family,&#8217; had a right to whatever they wanted. “Franklin men take what they want,” was a phrase he reported growing up hearing from his father, though there is no evidence this was the case in his father&#8217;s sexual behavior. The father, Dr. Carl M. Franklin, a former double vice-president of the University of Southern California, now deceased.</p>
<p>But Scott learned this to be true. Saw this demonstrated in other parts of his grandfather&#8217;s life. Craig&#8217;s father, had often gloated about his cleverness in persuading wealthy alumni to donate to the USC instead of leaving the money to their children. These same sentiments where shared in his letters to his children, later. A set of these papers is available for study.</p>
<p>Scott&#8217;s first sexual experience was a gang rape. Learning of this from a conversation overheard by his step-mother, Melinda, she demanded Craig take action. Craig immediately sent Scott back to his mother, but not before letting him know his behavior was not a problem, she later learned.</p>
<p>After Scott&#8217;s violent behavior, directed toward his mother, forced his removal to the home of his father and step-mother, his attempted to strangle his older step-sister when asked to clean up after his cat. The Franklin family blamed the victim, minimizing the violence done to the step-sister, who was six or seven inches shorter than Scott and weighed only 100 Lbs.</p>
<p>Craig, to the shock of his wife, expressed no condemnation of Scott&#8217;s behavior, using the event as an opportunity to go into counseling with Nathaniel Branden, who had previously had a sexual relationship with a woman Craig had stalked, Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>An inability to identify inappropriate and non-empathic behavior reoccurs throughout Craig&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Craig&#8217;s impact on Scott played out over the next years.</p>
<p>Craig&#8217;s second marriage to Melinda in 1987, a woman with three daughters who fit within the confines of his sexual target zone, was undertaken for several purposes. Two of these were to gain access to her daughters and provide cover for Craig&#8217;s inability to function in the normal world.</p>
<p>As is common with psychopaths he manipulated events to gain control of assets. Craig insisted the house, property of his new wife, be sold and another home purchased in which he had an interest to convert the value to his own control. He demanded the settlement from Melinda&#8217;s former marriage be used as a down payment and that he be allowed to adopt all of the children of her previous marriage, marginalizing the role of the children&#8217;s biological father and allowing him to better position himself as &#8216;Daddy.&#8217;</p>
<p>The marriage took place when Scott was still a young teenager. Craig immediately began a campaign of manipulation on the daughters, demeaning their mother, in preparation to obtaining sexual access. In this, he failed because his wife, Melinda, told him she would castrate any man who molested her children. Also, Craig&#8217;s ability to manipulate the children was hampered by their day to day familiarity with him.</p>
<p>Craig had noted to Melinda it took only six weeks for most people to understand he would not react emotionally within normal expectations. Until Craig and Melinda were living together, Melinda did not realize how strange Craig&#8217;s behavior could be. Craig, though highly intelligent, was not able to overcome what may have been a component of autism, thought by many to stem from the same root causes as psychopathy, in his functioning.</p>
<p>Melinda also had a son, who was of no interest to Craig except for purposes of manipulation, and a son the couple had together, again, used as a weapon when the couple divorced.</p>
<p>The marriage had placed Craig in a position where he had someone to blame for his inability to cope with normal life and who undertook to handle all parts except the taxes, which he concealed from Melinda until this became impossible due to their near bankruptcy in 1997.</p>
<p>In 1997 Melinda, discovering Craig&#8217;s non-filing of returns but not his psychopathic nature, threatened to file using the Americans with Disabilities Act, against the IRS. Despite the expectations of attorneys and Craig, they received refunds in the neighborhood of $250,000. These, she used to pay off their debts. At the end of the year they were solvent for the first time.</p>
<p>In 1996 Craig had obtained a grant of stock options, larger than any other employee. Both he and Dan, the president of the company, Green Hills Software, Inc., knew the success of the company had been produced from their &#8216;partnership.&#8217; The relationship allowed each man to advance toward his goals.</p>
<p>The company was now poised to go public. Craig was about to become very wealthy and, as another benefit of his employment, the company had covered for him on his non-filing and provided a corporate credit card which he could use without providing an accounting.</p>
<p>The cooperative arrangement between Craig and Dan now bore fruit for both men. Dan&#8217;s partnership with his former employer, Glenn Hightower, who had funded Green Hills Software, Inc., was subject to a &#8216;sudden death,&#8217; partnership agreement wherein either partner could demand to be bought out for a stated amount. If the challenged partner failed to come up with the funds in 3 months the other could exercise the buyout.</p>
<p>A recent graduate of Cal Tech, Dan had persuaded his employer to fund the Green Hills start up, which originally included another partner, Carl Rosenberg, who was eliminated in the early 90s using similar techniques as later used on Hightower.</p>
<p>Craig, with the assistance of the <a href="http://www.ghs.com/corporate/management_team.html#franklin">other vice presidents</a> of the company, ensured their employees would reject the finance team brought in by the VC partner, Glen Hightower, this taking place during the summer of 1998. In return for Craig&#8217;s help Dan had an attorney write a new stock option agreement, specific to Craig, in an attempt to characterize the options as his separate property. All grants to other employees, was identical, except for the number of shares, to the one originally signed by Franklin. By this time the 401K, marital property entirely earned during the marriage, disappeared. It is likely this was used to prepay for the options issued.</p>
<p>It was a &#8216;throw Mama from the Train,&#8217; strategy, intended to distance each man from their collaborative acts and both criminal and unethical.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Dowd was well aware of Craig&#8217;s sexual predilections. At least one sexual harassment law suit was quietly settled, filed by an employee.</p>
<p>Dan, acting on behalf of the company, expended time and money fighting off Melinda&#8217;s demands for discovery on the issue of the stock options and the 401K. A compliant judge, Thomas Anderle, refused to enforce the lawful demand for information.</p>
<p>During this time, September 1997, Melinda&#8217;s oldest son had suffered a major brain injury, and was not expected to live. Melinda herself had suffered a heart attack while clearing up the problems with the IRS and Craig&#8217;s finances and now needed corneal transplants due to an eye infection she ignored while ensuring the returns were filed. Although this happened in September of 1997 no one from Green Hills contacted her to offer their help or sympathy, though the family home was just blocks from the corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>Following the plan laid out for him by his attorney, Craig&#8217;s attorney went to the family home, rifled through Melinda&#8217;s papers, and stole the record which documented their adoption agreement. The divorce was conducted like a war, utilizing all the unethical practices usual to Jacqueline Misho&#8217;s practice, a methodology which would, several years later, earn her a starring role in the <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message892984/pg1">Post Divorce Tour</a> of John Cleese, whose wife had been represented by Misho. Melinda was slandered and libeled to the court and her acquaintance, as had happened to Craig&#8217;s previous wife.</p>
<p>Craig went into court and denied he was the father to any of Melinda&#8217;s children, but set up trust accounts for each child. He then absconded with the money, not a penny ever being given to any of the children. Without the documents the court accepted his bald statement, leaving five children without a legal father. The court did, however, grant a small portion of the exercised stock to the ownership of Melinda, declining to have her “reimburse” Franklin.</p>
<p>Dan undertook to carryout another strategy to deny these to Melinda, which has succeeded for over ten years.</p>
<p>Neither man evidenced any concern for the badly handicapped son, Arthur. Craig expressed exasperation Melinda had not died, a fact later reported to her. This was what he and the others cooperating with him, expected as her heart condition was inherited and her other sisters had died of the condition.</p>
<p>For both Craig and Dan, Melinda dead would have cleared the path to her daughters for him and eliminated potential exposure.</p>
<p>During this time Scott graduated from college and married. When Scott&#8217;s wife, K, gave birth to a daughter. Craig began visiting them. Craig allowed Scott&#8217;s wife&#8217;s parents to pay for stock, probably that stolen from Melinda. This was yielding a tidy income to the couple. Soon, Scott was, by the evidence, sharing his father&#8217;s fascination with pornography, as reflected in court papers several years later.</p>
<p>Melinda, the sole caretaker for her disabled son, was left penniless, living in a half-finished cabin in the mountains at 6,000 feet. She and her son were often without food and firewood. She was close to being legally blind and suffered a stroke in the dead of winter, receiving no medical care. Against expectations, she survived, a fact pointed out by Green Hills attorneys to prove nothing untoward occurred.</p>
<p>Then, in 2009, Scott, then the father of two children, <a href="http://www.appeal-democrat.com/articles/franklin-84964-house-murder.html">hired a hitman</a> to kill his estranged wife. Scott had lost his job and instead of looking for work decided to return to college, paid for by Craig. However, he was spending most of his time playing online games and watching child pornography, according to the court records. Due to a sting operation the hit did not happen. While in jail awaiting arraignment Scott, again, attempted to solicit a hit. His uncle, Craig&#8217;s brother, S Franklin, an attorney, expressed the opinion the police were making much out of a minor matter during a conversation with Melinda.</p>
<p>Asked by his father to return the stock Scott did so. Scott&#8217;s wife&#8217;s parents were not compensated and the only marital asset became unavailable to K, who was left destitute.</p>
<p>Craig ignored his son&#8217;s confrontation with the law, hiring an attorney in an attempt to obtain unsupervised visitation with his grand daughter. It was reported by Craig&#8217;s girl friend, Ann Fisher, that letters Scott wrote to his father remained unopened on a pile on his desk at work. Once Scott was no longer useful to Craig, he was forgotten.</p>
<p>The court refused Craig visitation, based on the observations of social workers. K and her children were admitted to a victims protection program and changed their identities.</p>
<p>Melinda&#8217;s youngest daughter gave birth to a little girl. Craig immediately began plying the couple with money and planned to retire to their area to, &#8216;<em>help raise my grand daughter.</em>&#8216; When Ayn, learned what had happened to K&#8217;s daughter and Craig&#8217;s monetary gifts were reported to the IRS, she cut all communication with her father. Craig had brought one of his paid companions down to hold, &#8220;<em>his grandchild</em>,&#8221; in hopes she would have a little girl with him.</p>
<p>Throughout the time Dan, who had persuaded Melinda to sign a settlement agreement in 2001 with the assurance he, acting in her best interest, would ensure Craig paid the court-ordered support regularly, used the law to evade giving Melinda the stock the court had granted to her. O&#8217;Dowd was well aware she was disabled herself and sole caretaker for a severely disabled adult son. By so doing he eventually put his entire business at risk. A sense of invincibility is an indicator for psychopathy as is, of course, intentional, calculated, deceit.</p>
<p>While far less is known about Dan&#8217;s personal life he is married to a woman of Chinese origin, Amy Chang. Amy, raised in a refugee camp before becoming a computer programmer, brought in relatives to raise the two children she had with Dan.</p>
<p>Around 2002 Green Hills Software had begun <a href="http://www.governmentcontractswon.com/department/defense/greenhills_software_inc_105722854.asp?yr=02">receiving government contracts</a> for software. While other companies in their industry are now struggling last year Green Hills had its best year ever, contracts for war have continued to be funded. Dan and Amy, who personally own 97% of the company received dividends of over $300,000,000.00. Today, this announcement appeared via the Internet. Green Hills Software is in line for a renewal of one of their government contracts for <a href="http://www.implu.com/federal_contracts/listing/N65236-11-R-0086">Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command</a>. “<em>The Government intends to issue a sole source contract in the estimated amount of $226,665.00 to Green Hills Software, Inc., 30 West Sola Street,Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2599.</em>”</p>
<p>Amy continued to exercise control for a non-profit started by Green Hills Software <a href="http://www.lastwishfoundation.org/children/">Fallen Heroes Last Wish Foundation</a>, founded in 2003. A call made to the company for a possible donation resulted in a referral to Amy at her home in Santa Barbara on behalf of Avon. In 2007, speaking for the Foundation, Amy declined to send toiletries to military serving in Iraq at Christmas time.</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s founding coincides with Green Hills&#8217; first winning of government contracts. Evidently, few grants were made and funds remaining in the Foundation&#8217;s account were eventually returned to its founders.</p>
<p>Psychopaths have very different goals and the seemingly irrationality of risks taken and strangeness makes it difficult for many normal people to comprehend or believe, even when the evidence is irrefutable. The &#8216;other than human&#8217; motives and nature of the behavior is believed by some to reflect in the representations of Devil in many human cultures.</p>
<p>Craig&#8217;s driving goal was sexual gratification and experiencing a sense of power through betraying the trust of his victim. This scenario is evidently optimized for him when the victim is a female child to whom he has caused to bond to him as a father. Dan allowed him to live out his fantasies under the cover of Green Hills Software, Inc. Several years ago Craig had a couch placed in his office. At least one of his female acquaintances reported being raped there during business hours. Other employees have commented on wondering why Dan tolerates Craig&#8217;s behavior, which includes bringing prostitutes to company functions, according to Anne Fisher.</p>
<p>Again, according to Fisher, Dan tried, unsuccessfully to place Craig in another location but Craig refused. His letters to women, which brought unwitting, hopeful contacts obtained through online dating services, went out using his corporate email address and from the company server. Craig deliberately chose unattractive women who would be unlikely to complain when they were raped and returned to the airport.</p>
<p>Craig, according to Fisher, started membership on high-end dating sites, using these to meet women. He stated as one of his relationship goals to have more children. Over the following years Craig built up a stable of &#8216;<a href="http://www.greedville.biz/romantic-realist.php">paid companions</a>,&#8217; who received checks or cash either for sex or for having dinner with him. These ranged from well known soft-core porn stars to first time prostitutes. Payment was made by the hour, for dinner of being part of a bevy of women who listened to him talk and play his guitar, or &#8216;assistants,&#8217; and &#8216;girl friends,&#8217; the latter expected to provide both personal services, such as tucking him in to bed with a glass of orange juice, making him meals, frozen and placed in his refrigerator, or sex.</p>
<p>Dan&#8217;s goal was very different. His entire life was fixed on becoming wealthier and more famous than the founder of Microsoft. While he has not succeeded, he has achieved far more success toward his goal than would have been possible without Craig.</p>
<p>Today Craig is still the senior vice-president of the billion-dollar software company, which holds large contracts from the government for sensitive technology. He is, however, scraping by, month to month as he has continued his pattern of extravagance, spending every penny he receives, according to Fisher. The actual management of the company is limited to a small set of individuals who know the facts.</p>
<p>Neither man has reached his goal, but their psychopathic partnership continues. Dan, and Green Hills Software, Inc., just received an award for <a href="http://www.sbscholarship.org/SouthCoastBusinessAwards/honorees.html">Entrepreneur of the Year on the West Coast</a>.</p>
<p>Together, both men were able to obtain an astonishing degree of gratification. Separately, each would have failed. This parallels the dynamics between Richard &#8220;Dick&#8221; Hickock and Perry Smith, portrayed by Truman Cupote in his book, “In Cold Blood.”</p>
<p>The message in Capote&#8217;s book and with the example above, each drawn from life, is that when psychopaths cooperate the innocent will pay the price. See <a href="http://greedville.biz/">Greedville.biz</a>, for more on this case and other cases, soon to be published.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/JudaismChristianityIslam3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/JudaismChristianityIslam2.jpg" alt="" /></a>Hey!  All you guys with the billion-dollar bank accounts!  Don&#8217;t you know that religions were founded on the principle of enriching the human spirit &#8212; not on enriching your own personal wealth.  Rich men can&#8217;t fit through the eye of a needle.  End of story.  Period.  God, I hate people who use religion as a means to get rich.</p>
<p>Would greedy bastards like Bush, Perry, Bachmann, Palin, Boener &#8212; or even Obama &#8212; ever be able to pass the Jesus test?  Hardly.  The Sermon on the Mount went right over their heads.  Corporatists pretending to be Christians?  That&#8217;s pathetic.</p>
<p>And what if Abraham or Moses came back to visit us earthlings today?  They would both kick Netanyahu&#8217;s butt!  &#8220;Read your Talmud!&#8221; they&#8217;d yell at him.  Corporatists pretending to be Jews?  That&#8217;s pathetic.</p>
<p>Would Mohammed approve of the Saudis bombing Bahrainian Muslims for fun and profit?  Or Sunnis and Shias killing each other by the thousands because of oil disputes?  Not on your life!  Corporatists pretending to be Muslims?  That&#8217;s pathetic.</p>
<p>It says &#8220;Under God&#8221; in our Pledge of Allegiance.  Do you ever see God approving of the resource wars that are now being conducted in His (or Her) name?  Hardly.  Do you ever see God approving of cutting Social Security to old folks and essentially giving them a death sentence so that the Pentagon can afford even more million-dollar drones to allow them to kill even more women and children?  Dudes, get a grip.</p>
<p>And speaking of our Pledge of Allegiance, it also says, &#8220;With Liberty and Justice for all&#8221;.  I can&#8217;t see that happening right now in America either, can you?</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world based on corporate greed, it&#8217;s not all about God &#8212; or Jesus or Abraham or Mohammed either.  It&#8217;s all about money.  It&#8217;s all about worshiping the Golden Calf &#8212; and then calling it religion.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t any of you corporatists EVER talk to me about religion ever again.  Talk to God about that.  And I would love to hear God&#8217;s reply.  &#8220;Go to Hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>I bet that if you added up all the human beings that corproratists have killed since the end of World War II (that famous war fought to make the world safe from corporatists!), you might find that corporatists have been responsible for more deaths than Stalin, Hitler and Mao combined &#8212; hard to believe at first but then if you count in the various resource wars in sub-Saharan Africa, Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Sudan, Libya, Iraq and Central and South America plus various other wars for oil and all the monetary fund victims dying from drought, slave wages and/or starvation from Somalia to Haiti to the DRC, and the disastrous War on Drugs plus all the deadly stunts pulled by both Bushes, Johnson, NAFTA, Clinton, Kissinger, Obama, Reagan, etc., I&#8217;d be very interested in the results.</p>
<p>But at least Hitler, Stalin and Mao didn&#8217;t claim to do all their killing in the name of religion.</p>

			<p><strong>Failures of Intelligence Is Why “America is Beautiful But She Has An Ugly Side”</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/patriotism-03.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/patriotism-02.jpg" alt="" /></a><em>“Lookin’ for a leader to bring our country home. Re-unite the red white and blue, before it turns to stone…America has a leader, but he’s not in The House…America is beautiful but she has an ugly side. We’re lookin’ for a leader with the Great Spirit on his side.” </em>-  Neil Young</p>
<p>This citizen of conscience for U.S. House of Representatives 2012 asserts that America’s ugly side is rooted in failures of intelligence, heretical Christianity and a lack of true patriotism, for “Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official.” -Theodore Roosevelt</p>
<p>“The Crusade for a Christian Military: Jesus Killed Mohammed” by Jeff Sharlet in HARPER’S May 2009 edition was a chilling clarion call regarding the entrenchment of Christian fundamentalism in the USA military that began during the Cold War, accelerated during the Vietnam era and which has wrecked havoc on the very soul of our nation.</p>
<p>Fundamentalist [referred to as evangelical by Sharlet] Chaplains began to join the military in droves as they aligned themselves with the Industrial Military Complex in opposition with Catholics and mainline moderate Protestant denominations such as Methodists, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians who were of one voice speaking out against American terrorism in Vietnam and for following in the ways of the nonviolent Jesus.</p>
<p>“Starting in 1987, Protestant denominations were lumped together simply as “Protestant”; moreover, the Pentagon began accrediting hundreds of evangelical and Pentecostal “endorsing agencies,” allowing graduates of fundamentalist Bible colleges—which often train clergy to view those from other faiths as enemies of Christ—to fill up nearly the entire allotment for Protestant chaplains. Today, more than two thirds of the military’s 2,900 active-duty chaplains are affiliated with evangelical or Pentecostal denominations.” [1]</p>
<p>“For decades, the military built a sense of solidarity out of a singular purpose, the Cold War struggle between free markets and state-planned economies—the shining city on a hill versus the evil empire…meshed neatly with ideologies [that connected] nationalism and fundamentalism…Communism…the dark alternative should we fail to unite. Fundamentalism thrived…a neat, black-and-white [theology and] a foreign policy. The end of the Cold War deprived militant evangelicals of that clarity [and] the emergence of “radical Islam” [became] the object of a new Cold War.” [Ibid]</p>
<p>The roots of American evangelism sprang from the original altar call for Christians to stand up against slavery. What has been passing for Christianity in our military today is the antithesis of what Jesus was all about.</p>
<p>“Everyone but Christians understands that Jesus was nonviolent.”-Gandhi</p>
<p>Clement, Tertillian, Polycarp and every other early Church Father taught that violence was a contradiction of what Christ was about. The first and greatest heresy in the Christian faith occurred in the third century when Augustine penned the “Just War Theory” for church and state united and “our problems stem from our acceptance of this filthy, rotten system.”-Dorothy Day</p>
<p>One of the greatest Christian spiritual leaders of all time, Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk that listened to Bob Dylan LP’s in his hermitage in Kentucky during the ’60′s was the first religious voice to rise up and speak out against the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Merton also said, “The duty of the Christian at this time is to do the one task God has imposed upon us in this world today. The task is to work for the total abolition of war. There can be no question that unless war is abolished; the world will remain constantly in a state of madness…The church [meaning all Christians] must lead the way on the road to the abolition of war…Peace is to be preached and nonviolence is to be explained and practiced.”</p>
<p>The deep spiritual darkness of Christian fundamentalism in the USA Air Force Academy in Colorado enabled the likes of Walid Shoebat, author of “Why We Want to Kill You” to speak to America’s troops in his role as a former fundamentalist Islamic supposed terrorist who is now a converted fundamentalist Christian.</p>
<p>Shoebat is one of the infamous darlings of many fear filled Christians and Jews [Read More: <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=814&amp;Itemid=197" target="_blank">The Walid Shoebat Show and "America is Beautiful, but she has an ugly side." - Neil Young</a> ] of the cult spewed by the likes of John Hagee and the idiot wind blown by FOX’s Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly and Neil Cavuto who have all hosted Shoebat as did the US Air Force Academy on Feb. 6, 2008 when he was the headline act at their annual political forum.</p>
<p>Walid Shoebat, has built a lucrative speaking career by manipulating the fears and whipping up hatred between Jews and Muslims. Shoebat insists that Israel should “wake up and smell the Hummus. We must return to the status quo – the occupation…Israel should stand strong and fight – dismantle Hamas and take away all the weapons, the way it used to be. The introduction of weapons into Palestinian society by Israel [under the Oslo accords, Israel gave assault rifles to Arafat’s ‘police force’ –ed.] was a disaster and they must be confiscated.” [2]</p>
<p>FACT: Israel originally supported Hamas to be a wedge between Fatah when Arafat became too popular with the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>Shoebat feels very strongly that the ongoing war against Israel has nothing to do with an Arab desire for a Palestinian state, “Never in history was there a Palestinian state, we never wanted a Palestinian state – even today the Palestinians do not want a Palestinian state…They want the destruction of the Jews, period. It’s a religious holy war.”[IBID]</p>
<p>FACT: Israel is a State and Palestine is the Land. States have obligations and people have rights!</p>
<p>During his time at the Air Force Academy, Sharlet encountered fervent fundamentalist militant American soldiers who are most misinformed of their very own faith for they neglect that for a Christian “our manifesto is the Sermon on the Mount, which means that we will try to be peacemakers.” -Dorothy Day</p>
<p>And “How can you kill people, when it is written in God’s commandment: ‘Thou shall not murder’?”– Leo Tolstoy</p>
<p>There are currently at least thirty-five wars being fought in the world and the USA is connected to every one of them.</p>
<p>Over forty-thousand people die every day of starvation.</p>
<p>Three billion humans endure dire destitution.</p>
<p>Hundred’s of children have been killed by unmanned drones under the Obama Administration.</p>
<p>America warehouse’s twenty-five thousand nuclear weapons and we the people inhabit a world darkened by bureaucratic systematic institutionalized structures of violence that kill human beings through war and poverty and all the consequences of destruction and despair that flow from corporate greed, violence and religiosity.</p>
<p>Nonviolence is at the core of every religion and Jesus promised it is the peacemakers who are the daughters and sons of God. Jesus denounced injustice, turned over the tables of the bankers in the Temple, was arrested, jailed, tortured and brutally executed, but remained nonviolent, compassionate and forgiving to all.</p>
<p>Jesus called us to love our neighbors- meaning everyone on the planet, to be compassionate to all, to seek justice for the disenfranchised, to forgive our enemies, to put down the sword. His death on the cross was in vain if those who claim to follow him do not have eyes to see and ears to hear that his message was we are to end the cycle of violence for God created, loves and is in all beings and all of creation.</p>
<p>It is a lack of imagination that accepts a future of endless war.</p>
<p>It is fear of the other that fuels fundamentalism.</p>
<p>The brand of Christianity being espoused by too many in our military is a fear-filled ideology that supports empire in this world and does not support what Jesus stood and died for: forgiveness, compassion and nonviolence.</p>
<p>The militarization of Christianity has nothing to do with the teachings of Jesus who promised it is the peacemakers who are the children of God and NOT those that bomb, torture, starve or occupy others!</p>
<p>The militarization of Christianity defies that “God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him. There is no fear in love. Perfect love drives out all fear because fear has to do with punishment.” 1 John 4:16, 18</p>
<p>The militarization of Christianity as professed by anti-Christ’s –meaning against the teachings of Christ- from the pulpit by preachers like John Hagee and in the fictional “Left Behind” series of profane theology express the spirit of the anti-Christ: fear of the other that drives one to violence.</p>
<p>The militarization of Christianity thrives on fear of the other but Jesus said: “FEAR NOT! You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free.”</p>
<p>The militarization of Christianity leaves behind all the non-negotiable’s for those who claim to be a Christian; which is you must forgive, bless and love your enemies-NOT bomb, torture or occupy any!</p>
<p>The problem is not with our troops or Christianity!</p>
<p>The problem is that too few who claim to be Christian have done it the way Jesus taught and modeled: to always work for PEACEFUL resolutions, even to the point of returning violence with compassion and forgiveness, as Jesus did when nailed to a cross and he prayed:  “Father forgive them, they do not know what they are doing.”</p>
<p>Christians are called by God to prayerfully use the gift of discernment and to test all things according to the teachings of Jesus. A follower of Jesus- or anyone with a good conscience- would choose equality, fraternity, community and nonviolent creative resistance to the evil that is violence.</p>
<p>It is willful ignorance, apathy, arrogance and misinformation that are holding back the transformation of hearts and minds to understand that war is the ultimate form of terrorism and supreme expression of the spirit of the anti-Christ; meaning against what Christ taught and modeled with his life!</p>
<p>“The first casualties of the military’s fundamentalist front are not the Iraqis and Afghans on the wrong side of an American F-16. They’re the spiritual warriors themselves.” [3]</p>
<p>Christ laid down in the Sermon on the Mount principles by which to guide lives, “Whoever hears these sayings of mine, and put them into practice, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded upon a rock.  And everyone that hears these sayings, and does not put them into practice, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was its fall.” (Matt. 7:24-27)</p>
<p>My Spin on the Sermon on the Mount:</p>
<p><em>About 2,000 years ago, when Christ was about 33, he hiked up a hill and sat down under an olive tree and began to teach the people;</em></p>
<p><em>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words: it is those who know their own spiritual poverty, their own limitations and ‘sins’ honestly and trust God loves them in spite of themselves who already live in the Kingdom of God.</em></p>
<p><em>How comforted we will all be, when we see, we haven’t got a clue, as to the depth and breadth of pure love and mercy of The Divine Mystery of The Universe.</em></p>
<p><em>God’s name in ancient Aramaic is Abba which means Daddy as much as Mommy and He/She: The Lord has said, “My ways are not your ways. My thoughts are not yours.” -Isaiah 55:8</em></p>
<p><em>Christ proclaimed more: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”</em></p>
<p><em>The essence of meek is to be patient with ignorance, slow to anger and never hold a grudge. In other words: how comforted you will be when you also know humility; when you know yourself, the good and the bad, for both cut through every human heart.</em></p>
<p><em>“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, they will be filled.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words: how comforted you will be when your greatest desire is to do what “God requires, and he has already told you what that is; BE JUST, BE MERCIFUL and walk humbly with your Lord.”-Micah 6:8</em></p>
<p><em>“Blessed are the merciful, they will be shown mercy.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words: how comforted you will all be when you choose to return only kindness to your ‘enemy.’</em></p>
<p><em>“For with the measure you measure against another, it will be measured back to you” Christ warns his disciples as he explains the law of karma in Luke 6:27-38.</em></p>
<p><em>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they see God.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words: how comforted you will be when you WAKE UP and see God is already within you, within every man, every woman and every child. The Supreme Being is everywhere, the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end, Beyond The Universe -and yet so small; within the heart of every atom.</em></p>
<p><em>“Blessed are The Peacemakers: THEY shall be called the children of God.”</em></p>
<p><em>And what a wonderful world it would be when we all seek peace by pursuing justice; for there can be none without the other.</em></p>
<p><em>“Blessed are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires, theirs is The Kingdom of Heaven.”</em></p>
<p><em>And one fine day the lion will lie down with The Lamb and man will make war no more; and that will create the Kingdom of God on planet earth.</em></p>
<p>St. Paul warned all followers of Christ to “not judge the non-believer; it is none of your business. But, when it comes to the believer, provoke one another to good works.”</p>
<p>The militarization of Christianity and all terrorism committed in the name of God must be confronted.</p>
<p>Our troops and veterans deserve overflowing gratitude-which is the highest expression of love- for “there is no greater love than one who will lay down his life for another.” [John 15:13]</p>
<p>Our troops require the best of intelligence and our world is desperate for Christians to follow what Jesus actually said.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/renewable-energy-policy3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/renewable-energy-policy2.jpg" alt="Energy Policy" /></a>As is typical with U.S. politicians and media, an extremely serious topic has nearly been reduced to absurdity. Once the urgency of the Gulf oil eruption has been fully sterilized, the stage will be set for business as usual politics — with the corporations comfortably in the driver seat. </p>
<p>But the corporate establishment cannot act too quickly in its fervor to drop the topic.</p>
<p>The environmental destruction brought on by corporate greed has opened the eyes of millions in the U.S. — eyes that are struggling to stay open as they now face the enormous sleep-producing machine of the mainstream media.</p>
<p>One way the media and politicians hypnotize the masses is by spreading the blame, and there are countless ways to do this.  </p>
<p>The right-wing media is taking a risky propaganda move by blaming Obama’s “big government” actions against BP, which is painted as the hapless victim of Obama’s “socialism.”  </p>
<p>Contrary to the media’s reporting, Obama did not “make” BP set up a $20 billion dollar account to pay for damages; this amount was agreed on behind closed doors for the purposes of calming public anger. BP had to “agree” to the “deal”; and as the Huffington Post reports, “… [Obama] administration officials also acknowledge a negotiation is at play here, and key issues remain unsolved.” (June 16, 2010).</p>
<p>In making its “big government” accusations, the right wing vastly underestimates working peoples’ hatred for giant corporations. As opposed to wishing that the government should take it easier on corporations, workers would like a much tougher response, for once.</p>
<p>How happy would millions of people be if BP’s assets —including those of the top shareholders and executives — were seized to clean up the oil spill and pay workers for their loss of livelihood? This cost will be at least a hundred times what BP “agreed” to pay. How many millions of people living in the U.S. angrily disagreed with Obama when he said: “BP is a strong and viable company and it is in all of our interests that it remain so.”</p>
<p>The media slant of the right wing is not entirely irrational, since it stems from a very real emotion: the fear that working people will demand that corporations be controlled democratically for the purpose of social need, not shareholders’ profit.  It is this phobia that will continue to guide the right-wing’s media perspective as the recession grinds on, creating an increased anti-corporate mentality. </p>
<p>And while the right wing poisons the truth about the oil spill by blaming Obama’s “big government,” Obama seeks to minimize BP’s role — and his own — by repeatedly blaming “America’s addiction to oil.” Although it&#8217;s true that the U.S. economy is oil dependent, Obama&#8217;s ulterior motive here is to disperse blame to everybody in the country, since most people drive cars or use oil-driven transportation. If we are all equally at fault, then nobody is to blame. The current crisis is thus pushed aside, so that “long term solutions” may be discussed instead.  </p>
<p>And while long-term energy solutions are desperately needed, they will not come from the U.S. two-party system. Obama’s oval office speech made this clear enough: in response to the largest environmental disaster in the recorded history, one of two &#8220;solutions&#8221; mentioned by Obama was “higher energy efficiency standards for buildings.”  Obama’s cuddling of BP results in part from another kind of investment of this mega-corporation:  “The largest beneficiary of campaign donations from BP in the 2008 election cycle, for instance, was President Obama, who took in $77,000 from company executives and its political action committee.” (The<em> New York Times</em>, June 19, 2010).</p>
<p>Obama’s oval office speech did not even mention the Democrat’s stalled energy bill, which includes the highly touted but Wall Street inspired Cap and Trade scheme. Even if the hugely insufficient energy bill did pass, it allots a measly $4 billion in research and development for alternative energy, an amount that will ensure that little progress is made. </p>
<p>An ex-advisor to Bill Clinton, Bill Galston, correctly concluded: &#8220;…[Obama’s oval office] speech tacitly sounded the death-knell for the inclusion of serious climate change provisions in any energy bill that Congress might enact this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, a real solution to the U.S. energy crisis was hinted at during Obama’s oval office speech, when he made reference to the U.S. economy’s immense transformation during World War II. His point was that the U.S. economy can change direction drastically to produce certain outcomes, and he’s right. War is definitely a challenge that the corporate establishment is willing to spend massive resources on. During World War II, the entire U.S. economy was directed towards this aim, with factories re-opening to massively produce tanks and bombs. </p>
<p>A similar effort will not be made towards alternative forms of energy. Millions of jobs could easily be created if closed auto plants and other factories were retooled to massively produce solar panels, windmills, energy-efficient windows, high-speed trains, buses, etc.     </p>
<p>The Gulf oil catastrophe has not proven to be a large enough disaster to provoke change, proving that nothing will as long as the Democrats and the Republicans are in charge. The U.S. oil and coal addictions will continue to produce masses of pollution and environmental destruction, the likes of which are beginning to challenge the future of humanity.</p>
<p>Since giant corporations constitute an enormous barrier to social progress, it will take the majority of working people to concentrate their energy on removing these obstacles.  The first step will be to end all support for the corporate-controlled Democrats and Republicans and work towards creating a political party that is democratically controlled by working people.</p>

			<p><img src='http://www.novakeo.com/images/pharmaceutical2.jpg' alt='Pharmaceutical' class='alignnone' />Business ethics has become an oxymoron.  Wall Street bonuses were up 17 percent to over $20 billion in 2009, the year taxpayers bailed out the financial sector after its meltdown.  So, everyone has many reasons to hate the banking and financial sectors that dumped our economy, and the general corruption of American politics by corporate interests.  There are good reasons to detest the pharmaceutical industry.  Besides raping people with onerous prices for prescription drugs, corporate greed coupled with ineffective government regulation and oversight is actually killing Americans through unsafe drugs.</p>
<p>Enter the newest fiasco, that sweetly named diabetes drug Avandia, so heavenly sounding, yet now revealed to be just another in a long history of drugs that get government approval but turn out to be lethal.  According to Bloomberg News: “Safety reviewers at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to take GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s diabetes drug Avandia off the market in 2008 because they said it was causing 500 additional heart attacks per month.”  A month!  The drug was linked to 304 deaths during the third quarter of 2009, which implies many thousands of deaths to date.</p>
<p>Consider these depressing developments.  In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have committed acts that forced them to pay the largest criminal fines in American history.  In cases involving Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb and four other drug companies, these fines and penalties have totaled over $7 billion since May 2004.  That is an amazing number, but in comparison to drug industry profits, merely a pittance.</p>
<p>In particular, Pfizer has been fined multiple times in the past 6 years for illegal off-label promotion of their drugs.  In its latest plea agreement, which took place last September, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in fines and penalties for off-label promotion of Bextra.  This settlement was the largest criminal fine in US history.  Clearly, this kind of corporate behavior requires diligent oversight by the Food and Drug Administration to protect Americans and to ensure the safety of American medicine.  Yet this newest Avandia outrage proves, yet again, that the federal government is failing people.</p>
<p>The Senate Finance Committee has just released a report and a letter to the FDA.  They have revealed that the FDA itself estimated that the drug caused approximately 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007.  “Americans have a right to know there are serious health risks associated with Avandia and GlaxoSmithKline had a responsibility to tell them.  Patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives and GlaxoSmithKline abused that trust,” said Senator Max Baucus.</p>
<p>The Senate committee started their investigation after the New England Journal of Medicine published a study in May 2007 warning of the possible cardiovascular risk of Avandia.  Avandia entered the market in 1999 and reached annual revenue of $3 billion by 2006, including sales of a combination drug that includes Avandia.  Sales plummeted to $1.2 billion in 2009, two years after that study was published which linked Avandia to a 43 percent increased risk of heart attack.  Before that the drug was the company’s second best selling drug, and they did everything to protect sales, rather than users of the drug.</p>
<p>The Senate report provides incredible details on how the drug company pursued countless awful tactics to thwart many efforts to reveal to the public and the medical community just how unsafe Avandia is.  The report notes: “The totality of evidence suggests that GSK was aware of the possible cardiac risks associated with Avandia years before such evidence became public.… Based on this knowledge, GSK had a duty to sufficiently warn patients and the FDA of its concerns in a timely manner.  Instead, GSK executives intimidated independent physicians, focused on strategies to minimize findings that Avandia may increase cardiovascular risk, and sought ways to downplay findings that the rival drug ACTOS (pioglitazone) might reduce cardiovascular risk.”</p>
<p>The company continues to fight to keep its drug in the market.  You can imagine the army of lobbyists being used to safeguard the interests of drug companies.  Other industries exhibit the same behavior, giving us widespread corporate pillage.</p>
<p>I and millions of other owners of Toyota vehicles cringe because, like so many other companies, it lost the capacity for telling the truth and protecting their consumers, and the federal government failed its oversight function.  With 31 lobbyists in Washington last year, Toyota has spent nearly $25 million on federal regulatory and legislative lobbying matters in the last five years, much more than any other foreign automaker.  Toyota’s registered lobbyists include at least eight former officials from Congress and the executive branch and it employs former engineers and officials from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the regulatory agency that failed to detect a pattern of safety problems at Toyota.</p>
<p>Put aside the anti-government rhetoric of the Tea Party movement.  The critical need is not for less government but for better government that really works in the public interest, especially protecting consumers from dastardly corporate powers.  Until that happens it is not surprising that the recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that two-thirds of Americans are dissatisfied or angry about the federal government.  Nearly 75 percent of independents feel this way.  If you think that electing either Democrats or Republicans will fix broken government, think again.  Both major parties are corrupted by corporate interests.</p>
