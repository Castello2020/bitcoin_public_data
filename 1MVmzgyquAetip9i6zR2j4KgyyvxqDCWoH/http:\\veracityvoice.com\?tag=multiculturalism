<p>How corrupt has America become? It has become as corrupt as globalism itself, a byproduct in international greed, where the gutting of good paying jobs has relegated the United States to being nothing more than a third rate country with a first rate war machine. An essential aspect to what we regard as the American economy today is its reliance on fraud and corruption, from the banking sector to corporations exporting and outsourcing good jobs with the help of a political class that is not only fraudulent but treasonous to the extreme, they are driving America towards an abyss that it will not come back from.</p>
<p>Waging international war for resources under false pretenses is a globalists wet dream, and under the cloak of the nefarious “war on terror,” multinational defense and security firms have made trillions of dollars over the last decade. They destroy so they can rebuild, and all the human collateral damage is just an unsightly part of doing business.</p>
<p>Another perverse aspect to globalism is massive illegal immigration under the disreputable banner of multiculturalism, for some shady businesses in America the profit margins can increase exponentially by hiring illegal workers over Americans.</p>
<p>Corporations hire illegal workers to keep wages low, and benefits to an absolute minimum. Americans are shunned for unquestioning cheep labor, and governments allow and foster this fraud to the detriment of many Americans. Some Americans, if you can still call them Americans, profit greatly in this perverse atmosphere of fraud.  The Federal government consistently places the interests of illegal aliens and businesses who hire them over and above American workers and the ‘rule of law’.</p>
<p>A case in point is Oklahoma, specifically Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has become a hotbed of greed and corruption. Tulsa is what some call a sanctuary city, where tens of thousands of illegal workers are in jobs that Americans are obviously not occupying. This ugly fact is good for some corporations and businesses, expanding their profits by paying undocumented workers low wages with no real benefits. What does it cost the American tax payers when these illegal workers have babies and use the medical industry with false identities, who foots the medical bills?  It defiantly is not businesses or the governments.</p>
<p>Another case in point is a company called Name Brand Clothing; based in Tulsa, it has stores in six states, the company sells salvage clothing at 75 percent off retail and it prefers to hire illegal workers instead of Americans. It is the proverbial &#8216;poster child&#8217; for corporate greed and corruption in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Why does it hire illegal workers? Well, first of all, it is about greed, making some people rich at the expense of everyone else. The managers at Name Brand Clothing generate outrageous bonuses by essentially suppressing wages on all hourly paid employees year after year. They choose illegal workers because illegal’s do not complain about being stuck on minimum wage for years on end with no real medical benefits and no paid holidays.</p>
<p>The owners and managers of Name Brand Clothing knowingly and willingly submit false identifications and Social Security Numbers to the IRS and to the Oklahoma Tax Commission, which is of course contrary to both federal and state laws. They have been doing this for over a decade, and they can commit these criminal acts because Federal and State governments are currently as corrupt and dishonest as companies like Name Brand Clothing.</p>
<p>Veracity Voice interviewed a long time worker at Name Brands Clothing for an inside examination into the workings of corporate greed and corruption that currently plagues corporate America.</p>
<p>We are protecting the person’s identity because the person is still currently employed by the company. We will refer to that person as the ‘Employee’.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: How long have you been working for Name Brands?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: I rather not say exactly since I still work for them, lets just say that I have been employed at Name Brands for about 10 years, give or take a couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What do you do there?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Again, I rather not say exactly, lets just say I worked in the head office, and have seen the corruption first hand.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Why have you decided to speak out at this time, and not before?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Actually I did in a way speak about this before; I wrote a letter to the Sheriff’s department, and the FBI about 4 years ago. I also wrote letters too FOX 23 and Channel Six News, concerning the outlandish fraud and corruption happening at Name Brands, and absolutely nothing came of it. It seems that it is not PC to talk about this issue in Tulsa; the mainstream media won’t touch it. That is why I am talking with Veracity Voice; the only outlet whistleblowers have today in America is in the alternative media.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Are you saying that the mainstream media is covering it up?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: In a way they are by not reporting all the law breaking going around Tulsa as far as hiring illegal workers by businesses, they certainly seem to be part of the club, and will not rock the boat.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What Club?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Corrupt businesses, Local, State and Federal governments that allow the criminal behavior, the police departments that will not enforce the law and mainstream media that will not report any of it. It is one big corrupt club.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What kind of fraud and corruption have you seen at Name Brands?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Well, you can compare the greed and corruption at Name Brands along the lines of what’s happening in Wall Street and the financial system, some people are profiting greatly through outright fraud and thievery at the expense of everyone else, and government is engaged in helping the criminality.</p>
<p>At Name Brands, the fraud is done by submitting false ID’s and Social Security Numbers (SSN) to the IRS. I’ve seen with my own eyes management turn away American workers seeking work then turn around and hire illegals. The main reason they do this, Is because the illegals are content to work for minimum wage with no real benefits. Essentially, they keep everyone’s wages stagnant except for management.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What do you mean except for management?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: The lower the costs for running the business, the higher the bonuses for management, its classic corporate greed. Management at Name Brands make large sums of money in the form of bonuses while all other workers do not receive real medical benefits or paid holidays except for two, Thanksgiving and Christmas, and those two paid holidays are highly conditional.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Highly conditional?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Yes, two weeks prior to Thanksgiving and Christmas if an employee is late for work for any reason Name Brands will not pay you for the holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: You’re kidding right?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: No, unfortunately I’m not kidding. At Name Brands it’s a culture of nepotism and greed, like the saying goes “there is no honor among thieves” there is no honesty, no real integrity, just godless corruption. There is one woman, who has worked for the company for 17 years, and she has only received one 5 cent raise not counting minimum wage increases. It’s outright disgusting how they treat workers.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Why does she stay?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Well, some people have problems, and finding other employment can be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What kind of problems?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: All sorts of problems like emotional and mental problems, in some cases drug problems, other cases workers being ex-convicts, finding employment can be difficult. Like some parasite, companies like Name Brands like to take advantage of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society, that’s why they like illegals; they can thieve from them without any complaint, protected by corrupt governments. Most self-respecting Americans will not work for a company that treats hourly workers like trash.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Let’s get back to the fraud, how many illegals are they employing?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: At TPC which is Name Brands production center in North Tulsa, they usually have around 80 illegals working there, and at their store in South Tulsa there are about 10.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: That many?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Yes, it’s absolutely incredulous and in your face. It is both frustrating and depressing at the same time to see this traitorous conduct on a daily basis. It is time for Americans to take a stand against these globalists that are profiting through corruption.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Who are the people that run Name Brands Clothing in Tulsa?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: As far as I know, Rusty Gaddy is the CEO, Jim Stevenson and Jim Breese are VP’s. At TPC there is Reid Lewellin and Jason Garman, both managers, and Brent Daily is the manager at the Tulsa Store, they all commit fraud on a daily bases. They do not care for America or Americans, all they care about is increasing their bonuses at the expense of everyone else, and what really bothers me is that the governments, both at the local and federal level engage in the same fraud, they do absolutely nothing about it. The Federal government knows very well that Name Brands has for well over a decade submitted thousands of false ID’s and SSN’s. This is criminal behavior at both the local and Federal level when the government chooses not to enforce its own laws.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What do you think should be done with these people?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: These people are more than thieving fraudsters, they are traitors to the country and its people, so I say arrest Rusty Gaddy, arrest Jim Breese, arrest Jason Garman and Reid Lewellin, and arrest all of the crooks that run the criminal enterprise called Name Brands Clothing. These people are also very cowardly, if they find out that any employee is against their corruption they will slander him or her with false accusations, they will make up stuff to make that employee look bad. The two most egregious slanderers at Name Brands are Jason Garman and Jim Breese, they will slander and harass you to the point of desperation, and people will quit their jobs because of the continual harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Job harassment is a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Yes, and they get away with that too.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Talk a little bit about the one man that has used more than one ID to work at Name Brands.</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Ya, he has three different aliases. I do not know which one is his real name, all I know is that Name Brands went out and got him a new fake ID, when they found out that the old ID the man was using belonged to a another man.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Where did they get the fake ID?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: I do not know for sure, I heard that they went to some website run by the Federal government, and it provided Name Brands with a fake ID.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: What do you think should be done with companies that choose to break the law as a regular part of doing business?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Again, arrest and prosecute the criminals, if law enforcement will not do their jobs, then Americans need to start fighting back by boycotting corporations like Name Brands that fragrantly and openly break the law. I mean these people act like it’s the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century or something; these anti-American globalists &#8211; at the end of the day that’s what these people really are &#8211; Name Brands conducts business like multinationals that run sweatshops all over the third world. They help create the culture of illegal behavior, by giving employment to illegals, which allows the illegals to stay in the city, drive vehicles without drivers licenses and insurance, use emergency Heath Services at taxpayer cost, they currently function ‘above the law’ and all accountability. Real Americans need to stand up against these criminals before they completely destroy this country.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Many in the business sector and in the political establishment will argue that the illegals fill jobs that Americans will not do, this reasoning is also pushed by the mainstream media, what do you say to this reasoning?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: I think it is a false argument, I&#8217;ve seen with my own eyes Name Brands turn away Americans willing to work, in some cases desperate for a job, they are turned away in favor of hiring illegals. So, that kind of reasoning is nothing more than an illusion.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Some will charge you with racism for holding these views, how do you respond to this kind of slander? </p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: It has been my experience that those that accuse people of being racist are in fact racists themselves. They falsely accuse others of being racist so they could push their nefarious agenda by smearing the reputations of those that are opposed to their mendacity and corruption. The charge of racism holds no water in the case of illegal immigration.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Why don’t you look for another job?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: I am its not easy finding work these days. And if I quit, I probably will not be able to collect unemployment benefits if I can’t find a job.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Because Name Brands will fight against your right to obtain unemployment insurance, its company policy. They will send their managers to testify against your eligibility for unemployment benefits, and they will without any hesitation, lie and malign anyone applying for the benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: They have done this before, entered false information against former employees to the Unemployment Bureau?</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: Yes, many times, and they get away with that too, companies like Name Brands function ‘above the law,’ and it must stop now.</p>
<p><strong>Veracity Voice</strong>: Thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>Employee</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p>The massive unrestrained flux in illegal immigration has changed the demographics of Tulsa, forcing many businesses to provide bilingual services, including city and state government services at great cost to the taxpayer. It is the ongoing balkanization of the city where east Tulsa is now known as little Mexico, a criminal and negative phenomenon that is currently occurring in many cities across the nation.</p>

<p>We are witnessing, I believe, a turning point in geopolitical history, one future historians may analyze as we have the Roman Empire’s fall. Vladimir Putin is making a move — and it’s not just against Ukraine. It may not be just a move against Eastern Europe. It’s not even, perhaps, just a move against US world dominance.</p>
<p>There was a time when the USSR was the “evil empire, a godless Golgotha. But that was then. Now, in 2013-14, Putin has seen fit to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/28/whos-godless-now-russia-says-its-us/?page=1">say</a>, in his December State of the Nation speech, “Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values. …Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation.”</p>
<p>This roughly coincided with Russia’s enactment of laws prohibiting homosexual propaganda and was a salvo against both the West’s Great Sexual Heresy and what enables it: moral relativism.</p>
<p>In another shot at relativism, Putin averred, “Society is now required…to accept without question the equality of good and evil, strange as it seems, concepts that are opposite in meaning.”</p>
<p>The Russian president then took aim at multiculturalism: “Today, many nations are revising their moral values and ethical norms, eroding ethnic traditions and differences between peoples and cultures.”</p>
<p>And now we’re seeing the release of Russian Culture War 2.0. In a document called &#8220;Foundations of the State Cultural Policy,&#8221; the Kremlin is doubling down and<a href="http://articles.mcall.com/2014-04-04/opinion/mc-russia-putin-west-web-20140404_1_leonid-bershidsky-ivanov-russia"> writes</a>, &#8220;Russia must be viewed as a unique and original civilization that cannot be reduced to &#8216;East&#8217; or &#8216;West.&#8217; …A concise way of formulating this stand would be, ‘Russia is not Europe.’” The document goes on to state that Russia rejects “such principles as multiculturalism and tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;projects imposing alien values on society.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, this is not your grandfather’s Russia.</p>
<p>But it very well may be your great-grandfather’s.</p>
<p>There are a few different things, I suspect, going on here. The 20 years after the Cold War’s end had been a period of <em>relative</em> co-operation between Russia and the West, but you can’t define yourself by going along (to get along) with the world’s cultural hegemon; you can’t be band leader by playing second fiddle. So Putin is defining his nation as the un-morally-wild West. In addition, he knows that to rally a people behind you, you need a boogeyman, your Eurasia, the “Nappy” (Napoleon) who will “get you,” British children, if you’re not good.</p>
<p>Yet it isn’t just that Putin is restarting the Cold War. Nor is he just an old-line KGB Bolshevik, as some stuck in commentary amber have suggested. He’s smart enough to realize that Marxism is, as the kids today would say, just so “played.”</p>
<p>He more likely wants to be the next czar.</p>
<p>What’s my theory? Try this on for size: It isn’t just that Putin wants to restore lost Russian glory.</p>
<p>He sees a chance to be a historic figure.</p>
<p>Note here that you don’t have to be good to be historic; Roman statesman Cicero called Julius Caesar an “ambitious villain,” but Caesar’s name is far better known than Cicero’s. And let’s consider what might be Putin’s calculation: the West has long been the world’s cultural trend-setter, spreading an increasingly un-Christian creed to all corners of the Earth. Of course, not everyone is on board. The Islamic abode wants nothing to do with it, but it’s Muslim; sub-Saharan Africa is largely opposed, but it lacks clout. As for South America, in addition to lacking clout it’s confused; and while China is gaining power, it’s largely pagan and non-committal on the culture war.</p>
<p>Enter the second Vladimir the Great.</p>
<p>Putin doesn’t just see a chance to define himself — and to unite the Russian people behind him — via opposition to the West, as his Marxist comrades once did.</p>
<p>He sees a chance to do it as today’s Charlemagne.</p>
<p>There’s an unsatisfied market for Christendom’s standard bearer, and Putin perceives an opportunity to exploit it. China won’t do it, Africa can’t, South America wouldn’t and couldn’t. But just as the original Vladimir the Great Christianized the Kievan Rus&#8217;, just as Charlemagne forged and helped Christianize modern Europe, Putin has a chance to lift the cross — and himself — high.</p>
<p>And the West is a gift that keeps on giving insofar as this goes. Our cultural Marxists are on the march, smell blood and will not stop. They will continue spending us into insolvency, perverting us into prone position, relativizing us into risibility and “immigrationizing” us into irrelevance. Even now, not satisfied with placing another great nail in marriage’s coffin, our militant secularists are making moves to<a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2013/09/the-slippery-slope-to-pedophilia.html"> legitimize pedophilia</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2352779/Bestiality-brothels-spreading-Germany-campaigner-claims-abusers-sex-animals-lifestyle-choice.html">bestiality</a>. It’s onward Luciferian soldiers.</p>
<p>And for Putin, it’s onward Christian soldier. As our degradation advances, Russia’s star can rise commensurately. Putin knows the West is in decline. He sees the demographic trends, that the US is transforming into a Third World/Hispanic nation and Western Europe into a Third World/Muslim continent. He knows that if there is another superpower in the near future, it will be Russia or China. And he knows what card he has to play to win this game.</p>
<p>Of course, while we could argue about whether the Christian-soldier solution is tactic and strategy or just tactic, it is so obviously prudent that it’s inconceivable Putin wouldn’t have pursued it. Just consider the benefits, starting with justification of Russian expansionism. If you’re a typical Russian, might not the idea that “the West is decadent, debauched, exhausted and effete” justify, in your mind, a Russian manifest destiny? Might it not be natural and wholly in accordance with man’s nature to believe that your moral superiority gives you the right to dominate? Note that this is the theory that helped justify the colonial powers’ imperialism: they were bringing civilization to a world of darkness. And it’s what we do to this day, applying secular values as standard. How often have we heard intervention in the Islamic “stan” du jour justified by pointing out that its rulers oppress women and are intolerant? The judgments are different, but the desire to claim the moral high ground is the same.</p>
<p>Then consider foreign relations. The USSR used to jockey for world influence with us; whereas before they had to market Marxism, however, now they can peddle purity. Standing against decadent Western secular-imperialism can win Russia many friends in Africa and even the Middle East, and most of the Far East will go with the dominant power.</p>
<p>Lastly, even if Putin is a functional atheist — even if his road to Heaven is paved with bad intentions — he surely knows that if Russia wants to prosper, Western secular/hedonist isms must be rejected. And why wouldn’t he know? As Soviet defector Yuri Bezmenov and others have<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJKJM36lMTE"> explained</a>, it was his erstwhile Marxist buddies who encouraged those movements in the West for the purposes of undermining our civilization.</p>
<p>But we’re doing a very good job of undermining it ourselves, and Putin is more concerned with building his own. Pat Buchanan recently <a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/pat-buchanan/whose-side-is-god-on-now.html">wrote</a> about this and pointed out that Putin may very well view his realm as “The Third Rome:”</p>
<p>The first Rome was the Holy City and seat of Christianity that fell to Odoacer and his barbarians in 476 A.D. The second Rome was Constantinople, Byzantium, (today&#8217;s Istanbul), which fell to the Turks in 1453. The successor city to Byzantium, the Third Rome, the last Rome to the old believers, was — Moscow.</p>
<p>Putin is entering a claim that Moscow is the Godly City of today and command post of the counter-reformation against the new paganism.</p>
<p>…Putin is saying the new ideological struggle is between a debauched West led by the United States and a traditionalist world Russia would be proud to lead.</p>
<p>Note here that the term “czar” is derived from the Latin word <em>Caesar</em>. And while Putin may be just as satisfied to be Julius or Augustus as Constantine, I’m quite sure that Marxism is no longer his bag. That would be playing second fiddle again — and the last thing the Russians want to be is like us.</p>

<p>Confrontation is a necessary dam to the progress of evil in society.</p>
<p>American policy is now confined to determining which of two evils will be rewarded.  For decades conservatives have been voting for the lesser of two evils, impaired by party loyalty and seeking a maligned victory, they fail to confront egregious evil.</p>
<p>Evil is inherent in diversity.  The exclusive righteousness characteristic of ancient Israel was predicated on maintaining religious purity.  That purity is being consistently destructed by toleration.</p>
<p>Christian churches should be at the forefront in confronting these dangers.  It is not surprising that the scant confrontation evidenced in the public domain is coming from Christians.  Nor is it surprising that Christian ministers pre-occupied with growing larger and more powerful churches are wont to confront evil either in the society at large or in their own congregations.</p>
<p>In February, 1994, the late Mother Theresa of Calcutta speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast with then President William Jefferson Clinton and his wife Hillary in the audience made the <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/<wbr></a>brochures/mtspeech.html&#8221;>following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself.</p>
<p>And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another? How do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? As always, we must persuade her with love and we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave even His life to love us. So, the mother who is thinking of abortion, should be helped to love, that is, to give until it hurts her plans, or her free time, to respect the life of her child. The father of that child, whoever he is, must also give until it hurts.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In January,1996, Pastor Joe Wright was invited to give the invocation as guest chaplain of the Kansas House.  The prayer he read was authored by Pastor Bob Russell of the Southeast Christian Church in Louisville, Kentucky.  <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/k/kansasprayer.htm#.UxDfu8uYYdU">Included in the prayer was the following litany</a>:</p>
<p>We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and inverted our values.</p>
<blockquote><p>We confess that we have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and called it moral pluralism.</p>
<p>We have worshiped other gods and called it multiculturalism.</p>
<p>We have endorsed perversion and called it an alternative lifestyle.</p>
<p>We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery.</p>
<p>We have neglected the needy and called it self-preservation.</p>
<p>We have rewarded laziness and called it welfare.</p>
<p>We have killed our unborn and called it choice.</p>
<p>We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable.</p>
<p>We have neglected to discipline our children and called it building self-esteem.</p>
<p>We have abused power and called it political savvy.</p>
<p>We have coveted our neighbors’ possessions and called it ambition.</p>
<p>We have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of expression.</p>
<p>We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our forefathers and called it enlightenment.</p></blockquote>
<p>In May, 1999, Darrell Scott, whose daughter Rachel was fatally shot at Littleton, Colorado’s Columbine High School, included the following poem in his poignant remarks before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee:</p>
<blockquote><p><center>Your laws ignore our deepest needs<br />
Your words are empty air<br />
You&#8217;ve stripped away our heritage<br />
You&#8217;ve outlawed simple prayer<br />
Now gunshots fill our classrooms<br />
And precious children die<br />
You seek for answers everywhere<br />
And ask the question &#8220;Why&#8221;<br />
You regulate restrictive laws<br />
Through legislative creed<br />
And yet you fail to understand that<br />
God is what we need!</center></p></blockquote>
<p>Hardness in the reprobate heart repels the confrontation of wisdom.  Mother Theresa’s sweet rebuke of the Clinton stand on abortion was quickly forgotten.  Several walked out on the repentant prayer read by Pastor Joe Wright and Darrell Scott’s confrontation of the House Judiciary subcommittee was like a drop of fresh water in a cesspool.</p>
<p>Error (polite for sin) is a common denominator to human existence and when it is not confronted it metastasizes.  In an effort to preserve their right to debauchery Americans have elevated human comfort above human righteousness.  They have failed to confront lies and distortions of fact in an effort to maintain peace.  This most grievous of errors has become pandemic in our churches rendering them useless in the maintenance of Godly Wisdom and Righteousness.</p>
<p>Fred Reed in one of his recent insightful columns concerning the press writes, “because of law, convention, and political fear papers have to hire &#8220;diverse&#8221; newsrooms. This exercises a powerful flattening effect on the news. For practical purposes it is not possible to express opinions, or to cover stories, that offend a sizable group on the floor of the newsroom. If your editor is female, or the guy at the next desk black, or gay, you find it very hard to write anything that these groups won’t like. You have to come to work every day. <a href="http://fredoneverything.net/ThisWeek'sFred.shtml">More diversity in the newsroom means less diversity in the news.</a>”</p>
<p>In a Brian Lamb interview on C-Span a caller queried Midge Dector, a Zionist Jewish author and wife of Neo-Con Norman Podhoretz, about why Jewish-Americans predominate in our superstructure.  The caller, who was able to announce that Jews make up a tiny fraction of the American population but have a tremendous amount of power, was loutishly cut off by Brian Lamb and Midge Dector with a straight but distasteful look on her face denied the existence of extensive Jewish power.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a lie.  Jewish intellectualism is cherished. They are a hardworking, intelligent, well educated, collusive, quasi-patriotic group of unassimilated Americans whose quest for behind the scenes power has been generously rewarded.</p>
<p>The road to Hell is paved with the inability to confront lies and America has been in the paving business for several decades.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the American media hides facts and perpetrates lies.  While the quest for world government with all of its ancillary plots forges fearlessly ahead, detailed discussion of its disastrous consequences for the American people is studiously avoided.</p>
<p>Reporting on confrontations that involve truth are never widely covered in the media.  With all the ballyhoo that is made about freedom of the press, America has not enjoyed a free press for a long time.  As Fred Reed so aptly states, the press is “controlled, controlled, controlled”.</p>
<p>Pictures of aborted babies are avoided; the cruel results of war and the mutilated bodies it produces are never shown to the public; neither the scourge of AIDS nor homosexual activities are reported in all their ugliness; diversity is promoted for America but not for Israel; the efficacy of Christianity is regularly questioned and authentic movies such as “The Passion of Christ” are denigrated.  America’s press, ridden with bias and homogeneity, is a threat to the Nation.</p>
<p>The recent ruckus over “The Passion of Christ” has brought the errant nature the media elite into focus.</p>
<p>To question the right of a Christian American to produce a Biblically authentic movie on the death of Christ because it does not conform to the Jewish agenda and the contrived propaganda of Abe Foxman and the Anti-Defamation League is both an example of the power of Jewish influence in America and a travesty of major proportions for both <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig4/lapin3.html">Jews and Christians</a>.</p>
<p>In an essay entitled “The Passion of the Christ, the Jews, and God” Screenwriter Brian Godawa addresses this problem with the following conclusion: <em>“So to understand the New Testament claims of Jesus as Messiah is to understand a history of Israel that includes hundreds of years of stiff-necked resistance to God&#8217;s own prophets, building to a climactic rejection and killing of God&#8217;s own Son, the Messiah, followed by the persecution of Messiah&#8217;s followers and terminating in God&#8217;s wrath and vengeance being taken out on the nation by the destruction of the holy city of Jerusalem and its temple. The barrenness of that temple, still desolate for over 2000 years, is a testament to the new spiritual temple created by God, the body of Christ — a new “nation” consisting of Jews and Gentiles who both have faith in Messiah, a Messiah, as portrayed in the movie The Passion of the Christ, whose rejection and victimization made Him the “unblemished lamb of sacrifice” slain on God&#8217;s altar to accomplish the victorious redemption of His people, the forgiveness of their sins.”</em></p>
<p>In his unique style Fred Reed praises the opportunity we all have on the Internet to express ideas that would never be inked in our newspapers.  This is, indeed, an exceptional opportunity but one that will surely be under attack by those that seek to exert their evil agenda over America.</p>

				<p>February 4, 2014 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19882#comments" title="Comment on Government Schools Common Core Indoctrination"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="19882 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19882">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last half century, the <a href="http://batr.org/twins/id40.html">public school establishment</a> in America has achieved enormous results, if the intention was to dumb down the population. The term public is archaic, since the current age promotes an internationalist interdependency culture, where the state defines institutional roles and sanctions accepted standards. The public plays virtually no effective role in this process. For this reason the proper term to use is government indoctrination centers. Bringing back the <a href="http://www.mcguffeyreaders.com/1836_original.htm">McGuffey Readers</a> as the alternative to the state syllabus of common core is a step in the right direction.Our <a href="http://batr.org/view_/090201.html">Dysfunctional Public Education Is No Accident</a> essay lays out the correct standard.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Education needs to be about teaching the tools, methods and process of &#8220;How To Think&#8221;. The mission of the instructor is one of developing the intuitive nature of inquiry that is natural in every person. Training the intrinsic urge of curiosity as the means of discriminating and rational thought is the prime goal for the educator. But to achieve this level of tutoring the teacher must be founded in their own understand in logic and analytical thinking. In today&#8217;s classroom, social engineering has replaced Aristotle, Locke and Kant with the latest celebrity of multiculturalism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy">Common Core site</a> attempts to outline the purpose and worthiness of their education standards. Sounds like a noble goal; however, what is the reality?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a natural outgrowth of meeting the charge to define college and career readiness, the Standards also lay out a vision of what it means to be a literate person in the twenty-first century. Indeed, the skills and understandings students are expected to demonstrate have wide applicability outside the classroom or workplace. Students who meet the Standards readily undertake the close, attentive reading that is at the heart of understanding and enjoying complex works of literature. They habitually perform the critical reading necessary to pick carefully through the staggering amount of information available today in print and digitally. They actively seek the wide, deep, and thoughtful engagement with high-quality literary and informational texts that builds knowledge, enlarges experience, and broadens worldviews. They reflexively demonstrate the cogent reasoning and use of evidence that is essential to both private deliberation and responsible citizenship in a democratic republic. In short, students who meet the Standards develop the skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening that are the foundation for any creative and purposeful expression in language.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Susan Berry presents a wealth of information and resource links in her article, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/01/12/Radical-Roots-of-Common-Core-Lead-To-Social-Justice-Indoctrination-In-Math-Class">Common Core Rooted In Math Class Social Justice Indoctrination</a> &#8220;While proponents of the Common Core claim that the new standards are focused on &#8220;college and career readiness,&#8221; more evidence is surfacing that a central purpose of the initiative is <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/04/Roots-of-Common-Core-Lie-In-Association-Between-Barack-Obama-And-Bill-Ayers">social justice and income redistribution indoctrination</a>.&#8221; This one example sums up the dilemma.</p>
<p><img alt="commoncore.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/commoncore.jpg" width="300" align="Left"  /></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Radical Math boasts over 700 lesson plans, articles, charts, books, and websites that cover a wide range of socio-political issues including redistribution of wealth, discrimination against the poor by whites, corporations, banks, etc., and the message that widespread racism against blacks continues in the United States today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now compare this critical appraisal to the lofty mission of math back in the Common Core mission statement. How can this statement below square with the above practice?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For over a decade, research studies of mathematics education in high-performing countries have pointed to the conclusion that the mathematics curriculum in the United States must become substantially more focused and coherent in order to improve mathematics achievement in this country. To deliver on the promise of common standards, the standards must address the problem of a curriculum that is &#8220;a mile wide and an inch deep.&#8221; These Standards are a substantial answer to that challenge.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Integration into a 21th century business and social model is the ultimate intent of the common core objective. Nowhere is there a debate of what kind of future mankind wants or the kind of reality that all human beings are intrinsically part of. Those questions require the study in humanity education and liberal arts training that are quite different from the instruction in algorithm programming.</p>
<p>The world view of this common core inculcation presupposes that society accepts their premises as a <em>fait accompli</em>. Their technocrat approach to instruction demands that authentic education must be marginalized if not outright eliminated. The traditional Christian cosmology has no place in this brave new world. In the article, <a href="http://truthinamericaneducation.com/common-core-state-standards/common-cores-negative-impact-on-education-and-biblical-literacy/">Common Core’s Negative Impact on Education and Biblical Literacy</a>, explains the destructive nature of this dehumanizing standardization.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The central organizing theme of the Common Core ELA standards is that study of creative literature must be diminished in favor of nonfiction &#8220;informational texts.&#8221; The idea is that students should be drilled in the types of documents they are more likely to encounter in their entry-level jobs (and make no mistake, Common Core is a workforce-development model, not an education model).</p>
<p>The fundamental problem with the Common Core approach is that, to achieve its job-training goals, it recognizes no difference between one &#8220;complex&#8221; text and another &#8220;complex&#8221; text. A great work of literature has value far beyond the complexity of the words used – it allows students to understand the eternal human condition; it allows them to confront human challenges that recur throughout the ages; it teaches empathy, prudence, forgiveness; it transports the readers to places and times not their own. The Common Core ELA standards are, quite simply, indifferent to this type of education. Training, not educating, is their goal. They are not interested in helping students become the people God created them to be; they are interested in creating workers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You can just hear the profane condemnation from the <a href="http://www.aft.org/about/innovate/commoncore.cfm">American Federation of Teacher</a> and the <a href="http://neatoday.org/2013/10/16/10-things-you-should-know-about-the-common-core/">National Education Association</a> opposing the mere mention of God in their secular temples of perdition. Irony excluded how biblical revelation dare be debated in a non-judgmental culture of relativism. At the heart of the government school establishment is an unending choir of fallen angels that preach their vision of paradise, while demanding ever higher budgets and far greater control over the indoctrination of their impressionable guinea pigs.</p>
<p><img alt="commoncore2.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/commoncore2.jpg.w300h200.jpg" width="300" align="Left" /></p>
<p>America is now a country stuck on stupid, greatly because of this unholy and apocalyptic system that dooms our society. Gee, moving to a <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/01/31/senate-resolution-to-tackle-common-cores-threat-of-national-curriculum/">common core curriculum</a> has the intent to eliminate the last remnants of independent school boards. Home Schooling is also threatened as the article, <a href="http://hedua.com/blog/homeschool-common-core/">What Homeschool Parents Need to Know about the Common Core</a> argues.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One factor is the century-long effort to nationalize and standardize American education. The standardization efforts have their roots in Dewey, Cubberley, and the schools of education at Stanford and Columbia. They picked up steam in the 1960s and 1970s as the national teachers’ unions gained more power. They strengthened more when President Jimmy Carter fulfilled a promise to the NEA by creating a separate, cabinet-level Department of Education.</p>
<p>The educrats dream of a day when every student in America will receive exactly the same education, using the same textbooks and lesson plans. Those textbooks and lesson plans will, of course, be developed by the best and the brightest, who will pass them down on tablets of stone. The worker bees and drones will be programmed to follow them exactly. This is a nightmare scenario, one which anyone who believes in individual rights, local control, and federalism should oppose at every opportunity. The Common Core Standards become dangerous when they form a stepping stone which helps to move the educrats’ vision forward.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Top down control always is intended to eradicate the voice of the individual. Under a national coordinated imposition of federal funding, local school districts have become dependent upon the conditional requirements of conformity to keep the money flowing.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? From the <a href="http://batr.org/view_/090201.html">Dysfunctional Public Education Is No Accident</a> article.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Reform is no long possible. A Federal Department of Education hastens central controls for social compliance. At this point, an education free from public schools, has more value than going through the disinformation that is currently being taught. The errors that are learned in childhood are more difficult to overturn, then if they were never acquired in the first place. So what exactly is the advantage in an education under government approved instructors? If you want to reverse the decay in moral aptitude, you must find alternatives for the education of your children.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Common Core pronouncements sound so nice. In spite of this, the key question is whether their program of study teaches the principles of developing good citizens. Lest we forget, a good citizen is an independent thinking and rationally responsible trained advocate of liberty and moral values. Maintaining and expanding a structure of mindless and obedient state compliance is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Our founding fathers were distinguished, well spoken and skilled in the understanding of human nature. Today’s specimens, hatched from government schools, are chicken-livered dimwits that aspire to the lowest paradigm that a common core can establish. The miserable failure of the taxpayer collective education system is undeniable by any judicious measure. RIP before the entire nation dies.</p>

<p>Despite the <a title="Etymology" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEtymology&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9eL1ifXrsvUsD2aAV63VZJ8bo1A" target="_blank">origin</a> of the term from the <a title="Ancient Greek" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAncient_Greek&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKWSOqBEM_STiDHSGcy63CRb0PSQ" target="_blank">Greek</a> roots “<i>skhizein” which means</i> &#8220;to split&#8221;, schizophrenia does not imply a &#8220;multiple personality disorder.”  The term means a &#8220;splitting of mental functions.”  You might say that someone suffering from a multiple personality disorder walks around with an endless number of “distinct” persons in his or her head.  All of them compete for dominance.  All of them create chaos in that person’s mind.</p>
<p>Enter the term “multiculturalism” where multiple cultures reside in the same country.   Ultimately cultures conflict with one another via people, passions and language.</p>
<p><a title="Jonathan H. Turner" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJonathan_H._Turner&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAybeFrUyI_XN2dAjss8pQCyVqXA" target="_blank">Jonathan H. Turner</a> defines it as a conflict caused by &#8220;differences in <a title="Culture" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCulture&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGU5LgCmmlUbeyY33uAATGv63CeQA" target="_blank">cultural</a> <a title="Value (personal and cultural)" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FValue_%2528personal_and_cultural%2529&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHL73EVApyuuXGZzyCOWcWwHmyEA" target="_blank">values</a> and <a title="Belief" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBelief&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1Qmzn-yV07ZFPBVtE1wqC4w5xmA" target="_blank">beliefs</a><wbr></wbr> that place people at odds with one another&#8221;. He defines this conflict as, “One that occurs when peoples’ expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met.  They face others that possess different cultural backgrounds and different expectations.”</p>
<p>We proved that cultures don’t mix when we usurped the Native American Indians of North America.  They have not integrated into the white man’s culture whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Cultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs,” said Turner.  “Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in <a title="Politics" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPolitics&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzv_OuriiecYpuFuk8FaLbIiVqXA" target="_blank">politics</a>, particularly on a macro level.  An example of cultural conflict is <a title="Abortion debate" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbortion_debate&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqi14-tEaBI25C6NUa77NvNNHdlg" target="_blank">the debate</a> over <a title="Abortion" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbortion&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgEhH1VH7wQaZKS-rHEvmCd7_52Q" target="_blank">abortion</a>.  <a title="Ethnic cleansing" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEthnic_cleansing&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7eMSsKpDe6zXCx4kkafSpz_X8Kg" target="_blank">Ethnic cleansing</a> is another extreme example of cultural conflict. Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict.”</p>
<p>The African-Americans versus European-American conflict rages in the United States without pause from 1776 to 2013.  No amount of laws, education, forced integration, police or legal consequences stop racial discrimination, racial bias, racism or violence.</p>
<p>Whether in the NFL two weeks ago with one black and one white player fighting over race or the Zimmerman-Martin killing or voting a black president into the White House—Americans fail to resolve the racial-cultural divide that permeates every city in America where blacks, Mexicans and whites mix.</p>
<p>Today, blacks in big cities practice a new game where they “Knockout” a white person from behind with a hammer or 2&#215;4 board.  “Black flash mobs” run around major US cities looting stores and killing white people. They take a video of their kills and boast on You Tube.  Much the same occurred in the 80s, 90s and last decade with blacks car- jacking whites in Detroit, Michigan at stoplights.  Whites fled to the tune of over 1.0 million over 20 years. Their flight dropped Detroit from 1.85 million to its current 680,000 today—over 90 percent Arabic-Black minority.</p>
<p>Illegal alien Mexican migrants attempt to fight their way into America demanding we suspend our laws in favor of legalizing their lawlessness. As their numbers continue to grow, we can expect violent demonstrations. They demand Americans speak Spanish and wherever Mexicans command dominant numbers, Americans must teach Mexican kids in Spanish. Mexican racism runs deep and virulent.</p>
<p>If you look at Norway, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Belgium and Holland today, you see the results of multiculturalism turning their countries into “Schizophrenic societies.”  All of them see major crime waves of rapes, murders, shoplifting, bursting prisons, schools in chaos, enclaving of entire cities into cultural ghettos, language changes, cultural changes and loss of societal cohesiveness.  Belgium, once all-European, will become an Islamic caliphate within four decades.  Its culture and language face ultimate displacement by its Islamic immigrants.</p>
<p>Of special note, Swedish women can no longer walk down the streets of Stockholm by themselves for fear of being accosted, raped or murdered by Muslim immigrant males.  Same in Norway and in France where Muslims dominate a specific enclave!</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, Holland and France face similar fates.</p>
<p>Within 37 years, the United States faces becoming a “Schizophrenic Society” with 100 million immigrants streaming into its borders from 150 countries around the world.  Some cultures will create and harbor their own in ghettos like the ones they fled.  Others will compete for dominance like the Islamic immigrants as they follow the prime directive of their Koran—“You must convert or kill all non-believers, especially the Jews.”</p>
<p>As this series winds down as to what America will look like in 2050, you cannot help but cringe at the loss of your own language, culture and way of life.  You may be sickened at what you see already occurring across America in Mexican ghettoes like Los Angeles, Houston and along the border with “colonias” that reek of third world misery.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to see our country turned into a schizophrenic cultural quagmire, call Speaker of the House John Boehner at <a href="tel:1%20202%20225%200600" target="_blank">1 202 225 0600</a>:</p>
<p>“Mr. Boehner, I understand that S744 doubles legal immigration from its current 1.0 million annually to 2.0 million while giving amnesty to 12 to 20 million illegal migrants. Do you understand that such an amnesty would flood America with over 100 million immigrants by 2050—a scant 37 years from now. How will we be able to water, house, work, feed, educate, medicate and care for that many people when we already suffer 48 million Americans who cannot secure jobs and live on food stamps? How will we maintain our environment and standard of living in light of those numbers. As an American citizen, I demand that you reduce all immigration to less than 100,000 annually and enforce the laws on the books to arrest, prosecute and jail employers of illegal migrants. That will help illegal migrants to go home on their own dime when they don’t have a job. Our own unemployed citizens can take those jobs at a living wage.”</p>
<p>Also: call your own U.S. Senators and leave the same message.</p>

			<p><strong>Illiteracy and racial dysfunction&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/literacyproblems2.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/literacyproblems2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Current U.S. Census Bureau figures show 22.3 percent of American citizens live below the poverty line.  That equates to 69,520,000 Americans.  They cannot secure a livable-wage job in order to pay for food, home, medical care and basic living in this country.</p>
<p>Within 37 years, demographic experts project an additional 100 million legal immigrants flowing into the United States of America.  They expect to arrive from Africa, Indonesia, India, China, the Middle East, Mexico, Central America, South America and many of the poverty-stricken countries of the world.  Their impact on America: they will force the addition, in sheer numbers, of an additional population enough to duplicate our 20 top metropolitan cities in the U.S. in 2013.</p>
<p>(Source: Pew Research Center, U.S. Population Projections by Fogel/Martin and the U.S. Census Bureau document those demographic facts.)</p>
<p>But what most Americans fail to understand stems from the fact that world human population expires at 57 million annually. Humans not only replace 57 million people, but also add an additional 80 million, net gain, to the planet annually. Total: 7.1 billion people in 2013.  That’s 137 million new babies that need to be watered, fed, housed, warmed, medicated and educated annually.  Unfortunately, those countries with those fecundity rates cannot educate that many new children annually.  They lack teachers, books, supplies and schools.  Tragically, over 10 million children starve to death annually. (Source: United Nations Population figures.)</p>
<p>The tragedy of America’s 1965 immigration bill added 100 million immigrants within 40 years; then, the 1986 amnesty accelerated the speed of the onslaught and now the proposed S744 amnesty bill expects to add another 100 million immigrants within 35 years or less.  Those desperate immigrants will pour into America at 200,000 every 30 days, along with their birth rates, diversity visas and chain-migration.</p>
<p>This five-minute video presents an example of illiteracy and what it costs you as this woman birthed 15 kids on welfare:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bavou_SEj1E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Why do you think those countries around the world suffer misery and starvation within their societies?  What causes it?  Why can’t they duplicate Western skills for filling grocery stores to the brim with food like you see all across America?   Answer: illiteracy, lack of intellectual horsepower, cultural poverty, lack of water and arable land.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we inject those factors into the USA at blinding speed. The new amnesty provides for two million, that’s 2,000,000 million third world immigrants annually.  They average 900,000 births annually, which equals 9 million in 10 years. That’s a total of 2.9 million legal immigrants annually. (Source: Dr. Steven Camorata, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cis.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1hidLAfqKWNFVBFI4ol-wNtBw0w" target="_blank">www.cis.org</a>)  When you look at S744, you see 250,000 green cards annually and many more visas on all levels. We could see that 100 million accelerate our population even faster than the predicated 37 years to rush from 316 million to 438 million.</p>
<p>Along the way, we lack the funds, the teachers, the schools, the resources and the languages to teach the endless millions of kids inundating our failing school systems.  Over 85 languages create linguistic chaos in my Denver, Colorado school system with minimum of 50 percent dropout rates and as high as 67 percent.  Detroit, Michigan runs 76 percent dropout rates as reported by Brian Williams at NBC Nightly News.</p>
<p>We face colossal cultural and educational dysfunction.  What one factor drives failed states around the world?  Answer: illiteracy.</p>
<p>With over 42 million Americans who cannot read, write or perform simple math, we face enormous challenges that we will not be able to solve. Some 48.1 million Americans subsist on food stamps today. They cannot work, function, feed or house themselves.  Do any of us possess any idea what the next 100 million immigrants will mean as to food stamps, section 8 housing, welfare and medical care? How will we cope with their languages?</p>

<p><b>Racial and linguistic segregation across America</b></p>
<p>When people lack education, but see wealth on TV, they react. When they can’t attain it, they shoplift, steal cars, form gangs and dwell in underworld ethnic enclaves.  You can see it in most failed countries in the world.</p>
<p>Today in Jackson, Mississippi, with a 90 percent African-American population, they elected a mayor who promotes changing five southern states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina into a separate Republic of New Black Afrika.</p>
<p>Journalist Andrea Ryan wrote, “Raising his fist in a black power salute during his swearing in, the newly elected mayor of Jackson, Mississippi was true to his character as a former leader of the black supremacy group, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRepublic_of_New_Afrika&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPNWmLc98gmyJXyYTtTQuPtmPVDQ" target="_blank">Republic of New Afrika</a>.  The group is dedicated to transforming five of the Southern states into an independent socialist black nation.  Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, born in Detroit as Edwin Finley Taliaferro, is a radical activist, and co-founder of the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement.  He’s, also, being praised by the Nation of Islam, who wrote in their publication, <em>Final Call</em>, that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmobile.wnd.com%2F2013%2F09%2Fnew-mayor-sets-sights-on-black-nation%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZt7DzL_LW5kSpfnSbK7aP2SfRgA" target="_blank">‘the seeds of a black nation are already taking root in Mississippi</a>.’</p>
<p>In Detroit, Michigan, now 93 percent Black and Middle Eastern population, Muslims expect to dominate that population as their numbers grow in the USA from their current seven million to well over 20 million by 2050.  They possess the capacity to use the U.S. Constitution to install Sharia Law by voting power of the majority.  At some point, another Mayor Chokwe Lumumba could rise out of the ashes of Detroit to lead it toward a separate state or country.</p>
<p>In the UK, France and Belgium, Sharia Law Muslims thugs prowl the streets to beat up on anyone uninformed enough to visit during the night. Last month, in London, England, ten Sharia “police”, caught on video, beat an American boy senseless and disfigured his face because he walked into the “no go zone” in the Muslim sector. France features over 70 “no go zones” dominated by Muslims.</p>
<p>Solid estimates in the USA show 22 Islamic “villages” guarded and walled off from public scrutiny in Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan and Oregon.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, the legal and illegal Mexican-Latino population overwhelms schools, housing, hospitals and food stamp stores. California features four million illegal migrants and most of them work underground or with forged papers.  They defraud food stamp and housing welfare rolls.  Spanish fast becomes THE language of southern California.  Unfortunately, they fled Mexico where the average child drops out of school by sixth grade. They repeat that cultural practice in California.  At some point, a Spanish Chokwe Lumumba will rise out of the quagmire of Los Angeles to lead that arena into a satellite state of Mexico.</p>

<p>What does this all add up to in our country?</p>
<ul>
<li>A first world country cannot continue at that level of excellence in the face of illiteracy and intellectual dysfunction.</li>
<li>A first world country cannot maintain its culture, language and educational levels of excellence by injecting itself with multiple languages, cultures and cultural illiteracy.</li>
<li>One look at the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Belgium and Holland offers a depressing look at the final outcome of mass immigration from disparate cultures and failed-states worldwide.</li>
<li>Multiculturalism, illiteracy and multi-lingualism do not, cannot and will not maintain America as a cohesive, viable, educated and first world civilization.</li>
<li>Since it’s not working in 2013, how will it work with another 100 million added immigrants within 37 year?  Answer: it will not!</li>

</div>
<p>In 1965, the United States demographic consisted of 90 percent European-Americans, 7 percent African-Americans and 3 percent Latino-Hispanic-Americans.</p>
<p>At that time, everyone considered themselves “Americans” in the “Melting Pot” of the great American experiment of a constitutional republic.</p>
<p>As with every mixed racial and ethnic country in the world—racism, discrimination and prejudice flourished.  ML King, Rodney King riots in LA, Detroit riots in 1968, Selma to Montgomery Freedom March, KKK and hundreds of other events took place.</p>
<p>Racial issues command front-page stories in 2013 with “Black Flash Mobs” forming and attacking white Americans.  A Latino-American killed a black American in Florida that caused tremendous unrest and demonstrations against “white” racism. (Trayvon Martin vs. George Zimmerman)  Mexican immigrants push African-Americans out of Los Angeles.  “White flight” from rapidly advancing minority populations provides TV talking heads with endless fodder for their take on racism and inequality in America.</p>
<p>White liberals with bumper stickers “Celebrate Diversity and Multiculturalism” carted their kids away from inner city schools with 20 different languages in Boulder, Colorado last fall to all white charter schools.</p>
<p>Not mentioned in the USA media: racism flourishes all over the world where different racial groups co-exist.  Mexico supports entrenched racism. Japan manifests racism by its non-immigration stance and sense of superiority over most other races.  Racism abounds in the Middle East.  Same in Africa and South America!</p>
<p>In the final analysis, racism stems from tribal-racial-cultural differences. It’s more biological than most people realize.  It flourishes in highly educated societies and expands in uneducated countries.</p>
<p>While unpleasant for decades, racism and racial inequality stand front and center in the political-public eye in America.  Racism hasn’t been stamped out no matter how many laws, forced integration, bussing, quotas, affirmative action and the like.</p>
<p>In all of this grand march, something historic happened to America in 1965 with Senator Teddy Kennedy’s Immigration Reform Act.  That single act dramatically changed America’s future from a dominant European tribe to a new majority that will become the new dominant ethnic group by 2042: Mexican-Latino-Hispanic.  (Source: PEW Research Center)</p>
<p>Within a 45-year span, Latino-Americans jumped from three percent of the population to 35 percent of the population on their way to 51 percent of the American population by 2042.  They will dominate in the four southern Border States.  They will make enormous ethnic, religious and cultural impact on all of America.</p>
<p>Today, virtually every business phone answering service offers: press “1” for Spanish, press “2” for English.  Another language expects to make its presence known as millions upon millions of Muslims enter America and force their language upon the landscape. Press “3” for Arabic already manifests in Detroit, Michigan also known as “Dearbornistan.”</p>
<p>“Islam&#8217;s borders are bloody and so are its innards. The fundamental problem for the West is not Islamic fundamentalism. It is Islam, a different civilization whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture and are obsessed with the inferiority of their power.”<br />
? <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fauthor%2Fshow%2F38041.Samuel_P_Huntington&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3-I6qJQD7x9P78iLBwOxWWkc_7w" target="_blank">Samuel P. Huntington</a></p>
<p>In other words, Americans allowed themselves to be transformed into another culture, language and ethos. Or, with the next 100 million immigrants arriving by 2050—a polyglot society.</p>
<p>“The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion […] but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact; non-Westerners never do.”   <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fauthor%2Fshow%2F38041.Samuel_P_Huntington&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3-I6qJQD7x9P78iLBwOxWWkc_7w" target="_blank">Samuel P. Huntington</a>, <i><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fwork%2Fquotes%2F403464&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNg-a9RNfzykRS1TGfZiYbZ55NNA" target="_blank">The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order</a></i></p>
<p>Because conquered people don’t forget, the Mexicans now migrated into America at well over 15 million in 2013, expect to enforce their language and customs onto the American landscape.  They succeed daily.  Classrooms in southern California feature Spanish as the only spoken language.</p>
<p>As this phenomenon advances, European-Americans flee areas that become dominated by minorities.  Reverse racism advances into the workplace dominated by Mexican-Americans.  If you can’t speak Spanish, you cannot secure a job.  Where Mexican-Americans dominate in America in 2013, flunkout/dropout rates skyrocket.  Why?  Average Mexican citizens quit school by the 6<sup>th</sup> grade.  In America, their minds quit even if they must attend school to age 16.</p>
<p>Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall, and that, “An autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.”</p>
<p><b>Americans stand by while their country disintegrates into an entirely different ethnic tribe(s)</b></p>
<p>Former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm spelled out in his famous speech—How to Destroy America: “Here is how they destroyed their countries.  First, turn America into a bilingual or multi lingual and bicultural country.  History shows that no nation can survive the tension, conflict and antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures.  It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; however, it is a curse for a society to be bilingual.  The historical scholar Seymour Lipset put it this way, “The histories of bilingual and bicultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension and tragedy.  Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, and Lebanon—all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with Basques, Bretons and Corsicans.”</p>
<p>As America launches on changing its ethnic identity, culture and language—does anyone understand the new reverse racism and how it will affect blacks and whites in America?</p>
<p>Does anyone understand the ramifications of adding 100 million immigrants in three decades?   Does anyone understand what it will take to keep this civilization running with accelerating illiteracy from the new Latino-Mexican dominating tribe?  Is anyone asking how we plan to water, feed and house that 100 million new immigrants that land on America?</p>
<p>Finally, are Americans ready for a complete change in language to many languages?  Are Americans ready to become a polyglot nation that fails on multiple levels today in endless countries around the world as witnessed in Governor Lamm’s speech?</p>
<p>“It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural. Nation-states will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations. The clash of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future.”  ? <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fauthor%2Fshow%2F38041.Samuel_P_Huntington&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3-I6qJQD7x9P78iLBwOxWWkc_7w" target="_blank">Samuel P. Huntington</a></p>
<p>With the passage of the S744 amnesty bill that will add two million legal immigrants annually, we remain on course to prove historian Arnold Toynbee correct, “I have observed that all great civilizations rise and fall, and that, an autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.”</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/zionism-US-strait-jacketed3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/zionism-US-strait-jacketed2.jpg" align="left" /></a>While shopping in a local grocery store my wife asked a nearby gentleman a question; he did not speak English.  Our local Mall has lost several upscale stores; they are quickly replaced but often with unfamiliar businesses.  We now have a Chinese Massage business in our Simon Mall.  The Chinese masseuses can say hello in English but little else.  Together they chatter away in Chinese.  At WalMart in the late afternoon a gaggle of different languages come from an equal number of unassimilated individuals and families.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to be in the company of familiar, like-minded people.   Disagreement destroys peace and causes strife while an inability to communicate isolates. Unfamiliar cultures are interesting to visit but vexing to live in.  Unity produces civic power; diversity is anarchic and feeble. </p>
<p>Minority cultures tend to lose many of their distinctive qualities in a couple of generations, multi-culturalism is self destructive.</p>
<p>As settlers flooded into the New World, America’s United States displaced the indigenous population and expanded across the continent of North America.  Its occupants were diverse within a limited range.  Most were Europeans seeking the freedom, wealth, and adventure of a new land.  They were a rugged and independent people willing to endure unlimited toil for the reward of self sufficiency.  Denominational divisions set them apart but most were European Christians.</p>
<p>In the early years of the new Republic care was taken in the numbers and roots of new immigrants. Originally the qualifications were European heritage, White skin, and a willingness to assimilate.  The need for industrial workers gradually relaxed Immigration laws expanding the ethnicity of new citizens; but the gates remained well guarded until 1965.</p>
<p>The Immigration Act of 1965 permanently changed the character of the United States.  It removed the nationality based quota system and expanded the eligibility scope to include all nationalities plus their extended families.  Contrary to most recorded history freshman Senator Ted Kennedy had very little to do with the new law; his contribution was mostly verbal. The law itself was written by Norbert Schlei, an assistant Attorney General during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.  Schlei was Jewish as were New York Represenative Emanuel Cellar and New York Senator Jacob Javits, the primary powers behind this disastrous legislation.  By the year 2050 it is expected that White Christian citizens of European extraction will be a minority in the nation they founded.   <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theoccidentalobserver.net%2F2013%2F05%2Fted-kennedy-did-not-pass-the-immigration-act-of-1965%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJCkFgViBiK_kkayktPgqVkqA8UA" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism has Jewish roots. Stephen Steinlight, an eloquent spokesman for Jewish policy, confirms this historic immigration policy and in 2004 urged a startling change:  “For Jews, the immigration debate pits the heart against the head. In their gut, many feel that substantially reducing immigration betrays the legacy of their parents and grandparents. But a growing number believes that maintaining this policy betrays their children and grandchildren. The danger arises because mass immigration means importing mass anti-Semitism. The upsurge of violent anti-Semitism in Western Europe tracks perfectly with mass immigration, especially of Muslims. Mass immigration is also the generator of Balkanizing notions of extreme multiculturalism. Having worked for nearly a century through communal organizations, the courts, and interfaith dialogue to achieve a tolerant and <i>cohesive</i> society largely free of anti-Semitism, it’s anguishing for American Jews to watch current immigration erase this outcome. However uncomfortable, American Jews must grapple with the issue: they have a greater stake than other Americans in how this policy plays out.” <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cis.org%2FImmgrationEffectsOnAmericanJewry&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7r-EtPH5WJ8htYf2aIvV0A-94Xg" target="_blank">The entire article is here</a></p>
<p>Jewish leadership doggedly conspires to enact policies that benefit Jews.  That these policies are inimical to the inhabitants of the nations they live in is of little concern.  This exclusive agenda has resulted in a litany of historic expulsions.  They were gradually expelled from Europe and England in 1290, France in 1306, Spain and Portugal in 1492, Hungry in 1376, Sicily in the 1400s, Bavaria in 1470, Bohemia in 1542, and Russia in 1881, 1891, 1897 and 1903.</p>
<p>Definitive success is part of their undoing.  As a race they are smart, persistently industrious, dominant, clannish, and supportive of each other.  They are social but they do not assimilate.  The Talmud has more influence on their behavior than the Ten Commandments.  Their work ethic and their clever, amoral wisdom make them invaluable in intellectual circles.  They are unusually successful in climbing the ladders of influence and power.  In the United States they make up less than 3 percent of the population but they exert frightening control over money, government, media, education, and much of industry.</p>
<p>Professor Kevin MacDonald contends that a high IQ allowed Jews to gain wealth and social status which they used to manipulate immigration policy. He writes, “Jewish organizations have been able to have a vastly disproportionate effect on U.S. immigration policy because Jews as a group are highly organized, highly intelligent and politically astute, and they were able to command a high level of financial, political, and intellectual resources in pursuing their political aims.”  (“The Culture of Critique”)</p>
<p>Their successful rise to power in the United States has been skillfully orchestrated by exploiting the Holocaust and controlling information.  Major assistance has come from starry eyed Evangelical Christians who with euphoric ignorance blindly support anything Jewish.  Control of the press has allowed manipulative Jewish interests to control the government and control of the government has allowed those same individuals to kidnap and use our nation for their own nefarious ends.     </p>
<p>American Jews are primarily <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAshkenazi_Jews&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJ0KANRHmKNiFGIpxfGiCl95t5Xg" target="_blank">Ashkenaz</a>i. They came to the United States in the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth century from Eastern Europe.  Since Communism was considered beneficial to Jews many of these immigrants were Marxists.  For a number of years in the early and mid-Twentieth Century the United States Communist Party was Kosher.</p>
<p>In a recent article entitled “Illegals Swarm in – Dallas Transformed”  Libertarian Nelson Hultberg writes,: “No country in the history of the world has ever survived multiculturalism. America will be no exception. All great nations<i> protect their borders</i>. They abide by the requisites for stability and ‘ordered freedom.’ Their intellectuals peruse history rigorously and learn from it. They respect the ethnic majority of their country. They do not malign its traditions and smear its heroes in the schools.”</p>
<p>Hultberg tells of efforts by Texas communities to stem the flow of immigrants and how those efforts were countered by the ACLU and other pro-immigration organizations.   He breaks with the Libertarian tenet of open borders but makes a serious strategic error by failing to mention the tremendous influence of powerful pro-immigration Jewish interests.  Substantial Jewish financial support sustains the ACLU which in addition to supporting open borders has been a major force in wiping Christianity from the public arena.</p>
<p>Jewish society is not homogeneous.  Jewishness is itself a form of religion but there are several different factions within Judaism. There is stronger diverse opinion in neo-Israel than in the United States.  Some Jews are Christians and some industriously expose the Satanic nature of Zionist leadership.  The Jewish population in general is to some extent a victim of the policies of their leaders.</p>
<p>The Jewish push for massive alien influxes is still in full swing.  If it becomes law Immigration bill S744 will add millions of new voters to the Democratic roster. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that current immigration volume plus S744 would create 32 million potential voters by 2036  The bill is being sponsored by radically Jewish New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer and supported by “The Gang of Eight” (Bennet, Durbin, Flake, Graham, McCain, Menendez, and Rubio) a gang that knows who butters their bread. </p>
<p>For many years United States citizens have displayed a dangerous ignorance of political reality.  Political parties create a wedge between party interests and the good of the nation and a Jewish  controlled press censors important news. Many of our citizens are intentionally stupid, they ignore impending danger seeking solace while it is available.  H. L. Mencken, the acerbic Baltimore pundit, called U. S. voters “Boobus Americanus” and the New York Post has confirmed the assumption with an article informing us that not only are our school children dumb by international standards but so is our adult population.   <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2013%2F10%2F08%2Fus-adults-are-dumber-than-the-average-human%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbG8bWbwB8Yp43kdpOiyaiWbqioQ" target="_blank">Read the article here</a>.  The United States of America has become an imperialistic power being controlled like a puppet by people much smarter than its’ voting adults.  We deserve the tyranny we are getting; we voted for the people who brought it to us.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/gangofeight3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/gangofeight2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Let’s do a little thought exercise here. Imagine that some force was flooding an indigenous people’s lands with millions of unassimilable foreigners, and it was understood that this influx would irretrievably change that land’s culture and replace the population. What would anthropologists call this phenomenon? Cultural genocide comes to mind.</p>
<p>Of course, in America we call it “immigration policy.”</p>
<p>Now, when King Edward I “Longshanks” said about dominating the Scots in the film <i>Braveheart</i>, “If we can’t get them out, we’ll breed them out,” it was to be expected from an enemy of Scotland. And how should we characterize America’s immigrationists, who have long been washing American culture away with endless waves of unassimilable foreigners?</p>
<p>Before answering, let’s first consider the testimony of Fredo Arias-King, ex-aide to former Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox (hat tip: <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2013/06/the_colonization_of_21st-century_america.html">Timothy Birdnow</a>). About how he and his colleagues spoke to 50 US congressmen and senators back in 1999 and 2000 he <a href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2006/back706.html">writes</a>:</p>
<p>Of those 50 legislators, 45 were unambiguously pro-immigration, even asking us at times to &#8220;send more.&#8221; This was true of both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>…[Moreover] [m]ost of them seemed to be aware of the negative or at least doubtful consequences of mass immigration from Latin America, while still advocating mass immigration.</p>
<p>… [The Democrat legislators] seemed more interested in those immigrants and their offspring as a tool to increase the role of the government in society and the economy. Several of them tended to see Latin American immigrants and even Latino constituents as both more dependent on and accepting of active government programs and the political class guaranteeing those programs, a point they emphasized more than the voting per se. Moreover, they saw Latinos as more loyal and &#8220;dependable&#8221; in supporting a patron-client system and in building reliable patronage networks to circumvent the exigencies of political life as devised by the Founding Fathers….</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers we spoke with knew…that they may not now receive their [the naturalized Mexicans’] votes, [but] they believed that these immigrants are more malleable than the existing American: That with enough care, convincing, and &#8220;teaching,&#8221; they could be converted, be grateful, and become dependent on them. Republicans seemed to idealize the patron-client relation with Hispanics as much as their Democratic competitors did.</p>
<p>…Also curiously, the Republican enthusiasm for increased immigration also was not so much about voting in the end, even with &#8220;converted&#8221; Latinos. Instead, these legislators seemingly believed that they could weaken the restraining and frustrating straightjacket devised by the Founding Fathers and abetted by American norms. In that idealized &#8220;new&#8221; United States, political uncertainty, demanding constituents, difficult elections, and accountability in general would &#8220;go away&#8221; after tinkering with the People….</p>
<p>…I remember few instances when a legislator spoke well of his or her white constituents. One even called them &#8220;rednecks,&#8221; and apologized to us on their behalf for their incorrect attitude on immigration. Most of them seemed to advocate changing the ethnic composition of the United States<i>as an end in itself</i>.</p>
<p>This isn’t unusual in the West, either. In fact, it was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6418456/Labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-UK-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html">revealed</a> in 2009 that the UK’s immigrationists sought to socially engineer a “multicultural” Britain because they wanted to “rub the Right&#8217;s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date” but didn’t want to divulge the scheme lest they lose their “core working class vote.” With friends like that….</p>
<p>Now, what would you call people who visit such a thing upon their own culture solely to gain power? And what fate do they deserve?</p>
<p>G.K. Chesterton’s comment, “It is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged,” comes to mind.</p>
<p>In fairness, Mr. Arias-King’s experiences predate the Tea Party revolution, and the House GOP did defeat John McCain’s shamnesty bill in 2007. I also suspect that it was legislators partial to immigration who were inclined to meet with him in the first place. And while I don’t doubt that closeted culturally genocidal maniacs still exist (in abundance), there are also those who genuinely believe that diversity should be “an end in itself.” Unfortunately, bad policy is equally destructive whether implemented out of malice or stupidity.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, multiculturalism can only ever be what it is, an ideology; it can never be a workable reality. Having many different cultures within the same borders is actually called balkanization, and its consequences have been repeatedly observed throughout history. If the differences among the disparate peoples become great enough, the nation may be partitioned so they can go their separate ways. And there are only two possibilities for avoiding this. One is if an iron fist of tyranny holds the competing cultures together, as Marshall Tito did in the former Yugoslavia (and we all know why it’s “former”); the other is if one group prevails over and subsumes the rest, as the Japanese have largely done with the Ainus, an aboriginal people who once dominated the island of Hokkaido.</p>
<p>This is absolutely the norm. Do the names, Saxons, Alans, Franks, Visigoths, Vandals, Avars, Alemanni and Frisians sound at all familiar? They were once distinct groups that occupied early medieval Europe, but they are no more, having been subsumed into a wider culture. This may be good thing if it’s a superior culture, it may be a bad thing if beauty was lost, or it may be a mixed bag. But it is an undeniable thing.</p>
<p>This brings us to the myth of diversity. All it can ever be is a liability to, hopefully, be overcome; it can never be the “strength” it’s billed as (without even a shred of evidence in support of the notion). And, interestingly, here’s what the Online Etymology Dictionary <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=diversity&amp;searchmode=none" target="_blank">tells us</a> about the origin of the term “diversity”: “mid-14c., from O.Fr. diversité (12c.) ‘difference, oddness, wickedness, perversity,’ from L. diversitatem ‘contrariety, disagreement, difference . . . .’” “Contrariety” and “disagreement”…. It certainly worked out that way in Yugoslavia, in the Soviet Union, in Czechoslovakia, in India (when two regions broke away and became Pakistan and Bangladesh). Why, even in Canada, where Quebecois and other Canadians are racially identical, there has often been talk of secession.</p>
<p>So how much more of a problem it is when a group not only has a different language, but is different racially, economically, culturally and ideologically? And what about when that group of diversifiers supposes it has a rightful claim to your territory (a <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2002/06/14221/">poll showed</a> a majority of Mexicans believing that the Southwest belongs to Mexico and that they have a “right to enter the U.S. without U.S. permission”)? What about when you try to teach these newcomers American history and they say, as a teacher respondent reported to me some years ago, “We don’t care about this — we’re Mexican.” When people have come to your land mainly to make money and have loyalty lying elsewhere, it doesn’t bode well for assimilation.</p>
<p>The kicker here is that flooding a nation with unassimilable foreigners may do no more for diversity over the long term than pythons in the Everglades. Sure, the swamp is currently more diverse — with tens of thousands of fascinating non-indigenous creatures added to the mix — but how diverse will the ecosystem be when they decimate native species? Thus have Florida authorities decided that amnesty for the snakes probably isn’t the best idea.</p>
<p>So it is with a cultural ecosystem. Harking back to my earlier point, the introduction of new cultural elements isn’t always just a matter of simple addition; subtraction and division can be factors as well. When worlds collide, when there is an incongruence of cultural elements, there may be mixing as with the wolf and coyote. Or there may be an extinction, as with how the Dodo on Mauritius was wiped out by rats. Of course, a new equilibrium is always established, but it may very well be less diverse. And, for sure, it will be different.</p>
<p>The good news here, if one can call it that, is embedded within the bad. The history of social engineers is that they possess no clearer a crystal ball than do futurists or science-fiction writers. If the immigrationist traitors simply want to destroy America, they will certainly get their way. But they will never have Mexico Norte, a republic they can comfortably rule as patrons of complacent clients. Because nature — in this case man’s — takes it course, and some people will likely realize that less is more — and that only divided we stand.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/illegalsunclesam3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/illegalsunclesam2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Saying there’s a bright side to amnesty may seem much like talk of the advantages of malignant cancer. But this won’t be a pie-in-the-sky article about the “economic benefits” of new workers, expanding the tax base or the wonders of “diversity.” There is no Ayotte-Rubio flip-flop here; in fact, for those who don’t know me, I’ve long called for a halt to even legal immigration. And understanding why is necessary to put amnesty’s “bright side” in perspective.</p>
<p>It is an inconvenient and ignored truth that the main problems posed by illegal migration are essentially the same problems of legal immigration. Are you concerned about an influx of low-skilled workers driving down wages and competing with native Americans? Legal immigration also floods the nation with low-skilled workers. Do you worry that amnesty will grow Democrat voter rolls? A vast majority of legal immigrants also vote Democrat. Most significantly, do you fret that millions of unassimilable foreigners with values contrary to Western ideals are transforming our culture into something distinctly non-Western? Legal immigrants are essentially of the same demographic, with 1965’s Immigration Reform Act ensuring that 85 percent of them hail from the Third World and Asia. The lesson?</p>
<p>Illegal migration isn’t the problem.</p>
<p>It’s an <i>exacerbation</i> of the problem.</p>
<p>To worry about it while accepting our current legal-immigration model is like losing sleep over the occasional counterfeiter while batting nary an eye at our government’s legalized counterfeiting (“quantitative easing”).</p>
<p>Of course, there is the difference that we can’t scrutinize undocumented Democrats and ensure that they’re not carrying bombs along with their bad ideology. But with respect to the only thing that matters over the long term — the destruction of Western culture in America — the most relevant way to define the types of migration isn’t “legal” and “illegal,” but good and bad. And, for the most part, the US has only one kind: the bad.</p>
<p>For those who would dispute this and say “Hey, everyone eventually assimilates; it just may take a couple of generations,” know that neither today’s immigrants nor today’s US are what they once were. For starters, approximately 50 percent of our new arrivals hail from Mexico alone, and 67 percent of American Hispanics have origins in that nation. University of Edinburgh professor Stephen Tierney explains what this means in his book <i>Multiculturalism and the Canadian Constitution</i>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fY078NtGPkAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=%22percent+of+immigrants+come+from+mexico%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7zPxnWlw2g&amp;sig=BGiKs138Mo6g9qt4U6v4xOmAG8Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dxTrS8LuN8L-8Ab1vvXLBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v">writing</a>:</p>
<p>In a situation in which immigrants are divided into many different groups originating in distant countries, there is no feasible prospect of any particular immigrant group’s challenging the hegemony of the national language [<a href="http://www.teaparty.org/sen-tim-kaine-speaks-in-spanish-on-senate-floor-pushes-immigration-bill-25310/">Tim Kaine’s español</a>, anyone?] and institutions.  These groups may form an alliance among themselves to fight for better treatment and accommodations, but such an alliance can only be developed within the language and institutions of the host society and, hence, is integrative.  In situations in which a single dominant immigrant group originates in a neighbouring country, the dynamics may be very different.  The Arabs in Spain, and Mexicans in the United States, do not need allies among other immigrant groups.  One could imagine claims for Arabic or Spanish to be declared a second official language, at least in regions where they are concentrated, and these immigrants could seek support from their neighbouring home country for such claims — in effect, establishing a kind of transnational extension of their original homeland in their new neighbouring country of residence.</p>
<p>And the blindness to the above helps explain the logic to many Republicans’ capitulation on amnesty. If the main threats posed by the two separated-by-legality migrations are the same and people don’t recognize them with respect to one, why should we be shocked that they don’t recognize them with respect to the other?</p>
<p>The truth is that amnesty is inevitable. If not the current version, a future one; if not today, tomorrow. This is because the nation has long been moving left, and when it slides far enough, all of the liberal agenda will be realized. And the importation of socialist-minded voters is a major factor in this transformation. Oh, I know that some — notably Ann Coulter in an <a href="http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2013-06-12.html">article</a> recently — point to polls showing that amnesty isn’t very high on Hispanics’ priority list. But this argument overlooks two things. First, all the polls mean is that Hispanics care about issues such as the economy and health care more, not that they don’t care about amnesty at all. Second, it’s much as with many blacks’ current opposition to amnesty. It’s irrelevant in a practical sense as long as, driven by anti-Republican prejudice and a desire for big government, these two groups continue supporting Democrats. People don’t smoke because they want tar in their lungs, but it comes with the choice.</p>
<p>Worse still, there will be no such thing as an amnesty with teeth, no matter what the Rubios of the world claim. Ultimately, there will be no significant border enforcement, no denial of benefits, no true accountability for illegal migrants. How do I know? It isn’t just that there never has been despite our having offered <i>seven</i> amnesties, and the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. It is because law means nothing without a certain necessary ingredient.</p>
<p>Will.</p>
<p>The left continually proves this. The Defense of Marriage Act is law, but Barack Obama simply refuses to enforce it. We have long had sanctuary (i.e., lawless) cities and those that refuse to obey federal drug laws. And, of course, there are literally thousands of more obscure laws on the books that are routinely ignored by states and localities, and our government has been trampling much of the supreme law of the land — the Constitution — for 100 years. Even more to the point here, the Obama administration has refused to enforce immigration laws already on the books and has granted a form of amnesty by executive order. So why suppose that a few more immigration laws would make a difference?</p>
<p>And the truth here is a sort of Catch-22: What would it mean if we really had the will to secure the border and enforce unwelcome rules on legalized illegals?</p>
<p>It would translate into our saying in the first place, unabashedly and unashamedly, “Get the heck out of our country.”</p>
<p>If our will is so wanting that we’ll pander on the big thing and not do what any sane nation does instinctively — deport invaders — it’s beyond silly to think we’ll suddenly man-up on the little things (especially since we have no history of doing that, either).</p>
<p>Given the dark picture I’ve painted, you may wonder what its bright side might be. Amnesty is inevitable, but even if it weren’t we’d still be finished because of our bad legal migration? Pass the hemlock. Yet there is a possible lemons-into-lemonade outcome .</p>
<p>Americans have become inured to the legal-immigration problem, accepting a no-go status quo like that proverbial frog in the frying pan of water. So the question is, how can you awaken reptilian-brain voters, who can’t sense steadily rising heat, to their impending 212-degree demise?</p>
<p>You turn up the flame.</p>
<p>High.</p>
<p>And along with the other ways that power is causing the left to stir the pot — the IRS abuses, ObamaCare, the anti-traditionalist rhetoric and violence — amnesty may help do just that. This could add fuel to the only hope for avoiding a descent into Third World autocracy. What is that hope? Well, if you have a severely gangrenous limb, you don’t entertain the fancy that the infection won’t spread if you simply label necrotic tissue healthy.</p>
<p>You cut your losses.</p>
<p>And our only hope is just that: the secessionist movement.</p>
<p>Hopefully, before states have to try to separate from Mexico Norte.</p>
<p>Lest I be misunderstood, this doesn’t mean I won’t fight the good fight. I’ll still oppose amnesty because doing so accords with truth. But I’ll also say that inside-the-box solutions are hopeless because that is the truth. And I’ll point out, as Christians would say, that God can bring good out of bad because that is the truth.</p>
<p>And we’d better hope and pray that this happens because, as far as our options go, bad is all we’ve got.</p>

				<p>June 16, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17856#respond" title="Comment on The Seeds of Tyranny: Fatherless Homes"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17856 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17856">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fatherhome3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fatherhome2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The position of the Father has been so badly distorted that few of us understand the Father’s proper role.  Families are the basic unit of creation and Fathers are the designated cadre.</p>
<p><span>Obedience, respect, and honor should be freely granted to Fathers; coercion destroys the structure. Families should expect the Father to provide leadership with authority, they should honor him and gratefully respond to his decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>When friendly adults are available children will shun authority and seek a conciliatory friendship.    They are quick to notice that one parent defends them against the other.  When parents are at odds over a child the child has justification for defiance. Adults who treat children as equals, who give them gifts and curry their favor outside of patriarchal government are doing them a disservice.</span></p>
<p><span>Mothers, grandfathers, grandmothers, teachers, neighbors, and other counselors who offer solace from the discipline of a father disparage the image of the Father in the eyes of the child.  Children need to witness fathers being honored and respected by family members as well as society at large.   When adults undermine the proper stature of a father they are contributing to delinquency.</span></p>
<p><span>The alien agents that control our media portray fathers as foolish, criminal, cruel, and demanding.  They make heroes of those who defy parental authority.  They do this for the same reason they saturate our society with pornography, promote homosexuality, multiculturalism, unlimited immigration, and discord; they do it to destroy our families and fracture the cohesion of our society.</span></p>
<p><span>We have emancipated women and sacrificed the authority of fathers in the process. Too often a child disciplined by a father goes to the mother who provides comfort. The father then becomes the illegitimate purveyor of misery and the children treat him accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>For a family to function properly the father’s authority must be respected by the entire family and when he disciplines a child the entire family must join him.  When another member of the family provides solace from the reprimand they do so in defiance of the father and to the detriment of the child and the proper functioning of the family.</span></p>
<p><span>Fathers are not always right but they are always fathers.  When they are wrong a good wife will ask them to consider a possible error.  If the father is in error and he changes his mind the wife has done a good deed.  If he fails to see his error and makes a mistake she must affirm the mistake; defiance undermines the father’s authority and creates chaos.</span></p>
<p><span>Recently, the media’s alien agents told us that 1 in 4 wives now earn more money than their husband. This statistic infers that 1 wife in 4 is of more value than her husband.  It is unnatural for women to exert authority over men and when they do they oppose the natural order. Women are the physically weaker sex and they should fill the role nature has given them.  When businesses defy the natural order by promoting women over men, they disrupt the peace and order of creation.</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that humans are somewhere on a created scale of life that goes from miniscule to massive. We have not yet fathomed either its depth or its height.  We are physically huge in comparison to the atom and equally tiny in comparison to the range of the Hubble Space Telescope.  Pondering our physical stature should bring us to a humility that would preclude attempting to alter the creation.  We can explore its beauty and mystery, learn more about it, move about in it, and use it to our advantage but attempts to alter a system that we did not and could not create is the height of chutzpah.</span></p>
<p><span>The family with a male and female at it genesis is a pattern that goes as far back into antiquity as human beings have been able to delve.</span></p>
<p><span>The absurdity of the agenda of the media’s alien agents is clearly <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/31/megyn-kelly-erick-erickson-lou-dobbs_n_3367571.html?ref=topbar" target="_blank">shown in a video</a> of Megyn Kelly’s stifling talk over.  In typical tyrannical media fashion Kelly refuses to allow an honest discourse with Erick Erickson.  She accuses Erickson of “judging” as if judging is evil (It isn’t).  (Originally Lou Dobbs was on the same video but Kelly stifled him so completely, they apparently removed that portion of the video.)</span></p>
<p><span>Four Star Generals from each branch of the armed service testified before congress about sexual advances against women.  One wonders how women who are unable to defend against friendly forces are going to do when they seek to defend against an enemy.  It is a bogus discussion   Four Star Generals who do not understand that women cannot be successfully mixed with men without sexual problems do not deserve to be leaders of our armed forces. Women are not physically able to protect themselves when they are put together with men.  It is the natural role of men to defend women.  We have destroyed that natural role by manipulating them into competition with men.  Though they are often intellectually equal or superior they are almost never equal physically. There is a natural sexual attraction between males and females and all attempts to stifle that attraction will fail.</span></p>
<p><span>Modern humanists are trying to change the basic structure of creation.  Genetically modified seeds are growing our food, human embryos are being created in test tubes, animals have been produced from DNA, and our fish and meat is being filled with weight making, profit producing chemicals.</span></p>
<p><span>Nature is replete with male and female specimens.  Males are usually stronger, bigger, and dominant. Working against the natural order alien agents are attempting to blur the distinction between male and female.  A recent newspaper had this headline: “Boy or Girl?  Gender a new challenge for schools”. What insidious hogwash!  Overwhelming children are born male or female and maintain that gender throughout their lives.  If the idea that they may be of another gender is <a href="http://www.massresistance.org/media/video/brainwashing.html" target="_blank">planted in their young minds by authority figures</a> some of them will maintain that nature went awry.  Questioning the gender of youngsters is an evil tactic of conniving humanity not a fact of nature.</span></p>
<p><span>Multiculturalism is another attempt to change the natural order.  Mixing races tends to destroy diversity through amalgamation.  It is an irrational procedure that has been accepted by too many rational minds.</span></p>
<p><span>When we allowed society’s alien agents to dethrone the father as head of the family we set in motion a huge array of mindless aberrations that have seriously injured the structure of our nation.</span></p>
<p><span>It is the work of the church and the family to restore order to our culture.  Our government is in the process of imposing a despotic pagan legal system.   School children are being indoctrinated with the homosexual agenda and churches are being forced to praise sodomites.  It is time for the horde of Evangelicals and Charismatics to take up the banner of fatherhood and promote it in the face of this horrendous social evil.</span></p>
<p><span>The authority of the father is key to a free and orderly society; it must be re-established if righteous order and freedom is ever to return to our culture.</span></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Stockholm-riots-Sweden-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Stockholm-riots-Sweden-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Youths in Stockholm Sweden mainly of immigrant backgrounds have set cars on fire and confronted the police with stones and rage for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/24/stockholm-rioting-continues-fifth-night?guni=Network%20front:network-front%20main-3%20Main%20trailblock:Network%20front%20-%20main%20trailblock:Position8">five consecutive nights</a>.</p>
<p>Sweden, the panacea and poster child nation for the globalists is starting to receive the fruits of their labor, which is the balkanization of Sweden through the globalist policy of multiculturalism.</p>
<p><strong>You reap what you sow</strong></p>
<p>The multicultural plague that has infected much of Western Europe has purposely resulted in a disenfranchised minority of young people with immigrant backgrounds from the east, who cannot find work, feel marginalized by a society that has deep cultural and philosophical roots that are in direct opposition to any new ethnic group with no affinity to their hosting country. The result is balkanization and conflict, the wet dream for any globalist narcissist.</p>
<p>Not even a highly socialized country like Sweden is immune to multicultural terror. Sweden presently has superlative social services and a very generous welfare system. Yet, the modern welfare state is not enough to curtail simmering ethnic tensions.</p>
<p>The globalists want massive immigration to destabilize the West, and in this they have succeeded, they have destroyed the cultural and religious integrity of Western Europe and North America. When the manufactured implosion of the financial system in the West occurs, full fledged rioting will commence a race war where ethnic communities will be battling each other into oblivion. The classic chaotic divide and conquer scenario.</p>
<p>Credit must be given to the global elite; the West is reverting back to a neo-feudal system controlled by aristocratic authoritarians who are determined to steal all the goodies before they collapse everything. This  staged economic and social demolition of all Western countries by what can be faithfully described as demonic forces, is geared for only one outcome – a world government controlled by centralized banks.</p>
<p>The current riots in Stockholm, and not long ago riots in <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_England_riots">London</a> and <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=314">Paris</a>, are the visible birth pangs to major economic and social upheaval. Creating antagonism where there wasn’t any before in Western Europe by mass immigration from the East, and in the United States via massive illegal immigration from Mexico is a diabolical tool used by the global elite to destabilize and overwhelm countries with profound cultural heritages. It is about destroying rich historic cultures and replacing it with high tech nihilism.</p>
<p>The recent <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/two-shot-after-man-hacked-to-death-in-london-street.1369236874Q">hacking murder of a British soldier in London</a> is another obvious failure of multiculturalism and the nefarious &#8216;war on terror&#8217;.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is nothing more than cultural rot on a grand scale. It exemplifies aberrant and deviant behavior over traditional morality. It glorifies death over life, where good is evil and evil is good, to kill you in order to save you.</p>
<p>Progressives and social engineers, the minions of the globalists, will <a href="http://http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22650267">excuse the rioting in Sweden</a> as an expected result of racism, ignorance and inequality in the country; ultimately believing they can somehow influence through public education the fallacy of so called racism to children that are by their own engineering being chemically dumbed down by fluoride and vaccines. This is beyond stupidity, it is diabolically insane.</p>
<p>A stupid unthinking populace is what they really want, a population of <a href="http://http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/05/22/the-chemical-castration-of-our-childrens-brains/">chemicalized zombies</a> who will unthinkingly accept ‘wars of aggression’ on thousand year old homophobic cultures at the same time allowing these bombed out natives to immigrate to the countries that are bombing them. Dislocation and cultural castration on a global scale will be the final result of this technocratic aggression throughout the world, exactly what the global elite are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>This cannot end well; the technocrats and kleptocrats will continue to ferment violence and war worldwide resulting in massive death, and what&#8217;s left living in the end will be placed in their universal gulag run by crazed psychopaths.</p>
<p>So when you see your cities going up in flames because of so called extremists, know very well that it is all being designed for you, so you can willingly join the club of the castrated and chained.</p>

			<p><strong>It Lost&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/private-property-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/private-property-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>“Wherever private property disappears, man’s liberty is gone.  Man is placed completely at the mercy of the state.  Wherever private ownership is weakened, man’s liberty is weakened also.  There is an essential relationship between liberty and property.”  R. J. Rushdoony</p>
<p><span>The Heritage Foundation provides an excellent summary of property rights.  They describe a rating of 100 this way: “Private property is guaranteed by the government. The court system enforces contracts efficiently and quickly. The justice system punishes those who unlawfully confiscate private property. There is no corruption or expropriation.”  At 50, “The court system is inefficient and subject to delays. Corruption may be present, and the judiciary may be influenced by other branches of government. Expropriation is possible but rare.”  At 0, “Private property is outlawed, and all property belongs to the state. People do not have the right to sue others and do not have access to the courts. Corruption is endemic.</span></p>
<p><span>In 1995 world property rights were rated at 56.  In 2013 they are rated at 43, a reduction of over 20 percent. (See the graph in the Heritage Link below.)</span></p>
<p><span>Though freedom is tending down throughout the world it remains highest in Western nations and lowest in the Third World.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The Heritage link rates the United States of America tenth behind Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Chile, Mauritius, and Denmark. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/index/property-rights" target="_blank">Click here</a><span> for the Heritage Foundation Property Rights link.</span></p>
<p><span>The U. S. Government now owns over 50 percent of the nation’s land and the incremental incursion of United Nation’s Agenda 21 continues to add to the coffer.  On Michael Shaw’s </span><a href="http://www.freedomadvocates.org/articles/private_property/what_is_private_property?_20061003176/" target="_blank">“Freedom Advocates”</a><span>page he writes, “Agenda 21 seeks to transform America while eliminating the middle class. It plans to reach these goals on several fronts: by restructuring agriculture, creating broad wildlife corridors void of human activity, determining where and how people live, controlling human reproduction and human movement, constraining and controlling energy consumption and water use—in short, by eliminating private property.”</span></p>
<p><span>“The institution of private property makes possible three things essential to our liberty:  It encourages productive activity, allowing us to turn our ideas into actions and to realize the benefits of those actions. It allows us to engage in voluntary trade with others, multiplying the benefits of individual action a thousand-fold.  It enables us to safeguard and develop our resources responsibly and to secure peace and prosperity as a result. To appreciate the importance of private property in your own life, you need only to consider the significance of these two facts:  Private property represents everything you obtain through productive effort or voluntary trade.  Its essence is your right to determine its use”</span></p>
<p><span>The right to private property is being eroded in the United States and around the world.  World government seeks to exert absolute control; treating people like herds of cattle to be used as labor on the world plantation.  Like a bee hive the world will be filled with worker bees whose sole task is to provide an opulent leisure for the ruling class.  National pride will give way to a multicultural social order with intermarriages blurring racial identities. Only the Nation of Israel will remain intact.  Other nations and races are destined to become worker bees indistinguishable from one another.  This is the plan.  It is the logic behind the deliberate dumbing down of America and the massive push for multicultural integration. It is the impetus for the destruction of Christianity with its emphasis on the individual. The plan is diabolical, a direct download from Satan himself.</span></p>
<p><span>The snake of humanism is very prolific when it invades a society rationality disappears and as humans stray farther and farther from their Creator, foolishness grows with exponential rapidity.</span></p>
<p><span>We live with and have accepted an increasing number of social insanities: Our president who may be Constitutionally ineligible has been elected to a second term; our government has enslaved its citizens with a national debt of </span><a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/" target="_blank">$16 trillion dollars</a><span> which amounts to over $50 thousand per citizen; in direct defiance of the natural order we are training women to fight against men in defense of our nation and sanctioning homosexual marriage; the hallowed halls of our educational institutions have accepted the weakening results of multiculturalism as a desirable goal;  our citizens have been convinced that relatively weak and militarily insignificant nations in the Arab world are a danger to us; with text book insanity Americans continue to participate in a political system that is progressively enslaving them; and while all this subterfuge goes on our government supports an international court that prosecutes crimes against humanity while they are the biggest perpetrator.</span></p>
<p><span>Most Americans harbor a lackadaisical confidence that things will improve.  They ignore the world debt crisis and fail to consider that ultimately the lenders will call on the citizens of the United States to pay the debt their government has accumulated. Think of the austerity required for an American family of four to pay off a debt of $200,000.00.  That figure is quickly rising as our politicians continue to use the public credit card.  The debtor is a slave to the lender and the United States of America is a plantation populated by slaves whose willful ignorance allows them to go about their daily tasks as if all were well.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The One True God is at odds with the new world order; it seeks to tyrannize us while He seeks to free us through obedience to His Commandments.  When God and His Law are forsaken despotism is inevitable.  We were not created to govern ourselves and since we have failed to encode this truth we are experiencing the results of our failure.</span></p>
<p><span>Partisan politics warned us about the dictatorial nature of the Obama Administration but the erstwhile Bush cabal was equally malignant.  Changing political partoes is useless. We have long ago lost control of our government and our opinions no longer matter.   Congress persons and senators vote the will of the money powers and the money powers reward them with re-election.</span></p>
<p><span>In Boston and Watertown, Massachusetts local, state, and federal authorities deployed a frightening array of coordinated force to apprehend two young men they described as terrorists.  Acting as judge and jury they violated the legal rights of the suspects and encroached on property rights by <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/136233.html" target="_blank">invading homes</a> and restricting the movement of their occupants.  The entire operation resembled aiming a howitzer at a house fly.</span></p>
<p><span>The citizens of the United States of America have been put on notice that neither they nor their properties can claim protections from the unrestrained power of those that rule them.</span></p>
<p><span>Several times I have written that Americans need to repent from theirs and their father’s wicked ways. This admonition has fallen on deaf ears and some have advised me that I should stop writing about it because it will never happen.</span></p>
<p><span>In a recent email from American Vision Dr. Joel McDurmon wrote that “a corrupt government is the product of a corrupt people”. He quoted H. L. Mencken, “Democracy is the theory that the common people know what They want, and deserve to get it good and hard.” and went on to contend that God often punishes a wicked populace by exposing them to their own sins. “Thus do the politically deluded live in a denial which dismisses even God’s Word in favor of the assertion of human wisdom.  So often do men shelter their pet political beliefs from even divine criticism.  So often do men deny God’s Word to advance their own desires. So often do men rest on false assurances built on their own godless dreams.  And just as often do societies weather and decay from the blights of human vanity.”   </span><a href="http://americanvision.org/7832/godless-state-serfdom-1-samuel-89-22/" target="_blank">Read here.</a></p>
<p><span>America and its people have supported illegal aggression and encouraged murderous wars.  We have pride fully maintained our national superiority and encouraged the use of weapons of mass destruction. We have supported our government in the role of a deity and now, since we have granted it that role, it has begun reflecting it in action.  We have winked at sin, dallied in its fringes, and taken an occasional bath.  Dishonest measurements have been accepted for decades; our buildings are constructed with dishonest two-by-fours that are actually only one and a half by three and three quarters.  Now even our Pound Cakes weigh only fourteen ounces.  Dishonesty has permeated our culture!  Our media uses lies, gross omissions, and misrepresentations in reporting the news and our government regularly distorts facts and figures.  While all this defiance of God continues our churches disregard their proper function by seeking peace and respectability.  Abortion is a horrendous sin but it is only one sin; our cancerous pride covers scores of others.</span></p>
<p><span>One of my nieces is married to a lawyer.  He employs a logical mind that makes conversation interesting.  He is a Democrat who supports Obama and believes he is doing a reasonably good job.  His approach to life is pragmatic, he considers himself moral, and understands that there is room for disagreement.  We did not set parameters for our talk but I believe he would agree with Democrat Harry Reid that government is inherently good and with Libertarian Jacob Hornberger that it should be constrained by natural law.</span></p>
<p><span>Natural law alone would never have created the freedom and order the United States of America has enjoyed.  It was Christianity and the Laws God gave to Moses that buttressed a secular government and made our nation great. Though not always pronounced it was almost universally supported even by many whose personal beliefs were different.  Pragmatism is a pagan procedure that allows compromise with evil and the end to justify the means.  Freedom is always endangered by pragmatism.</span></p>
<p><span>Because we are no longer a righteous nation we are quickly losing our freedom. The longer we linger in secular humanism the greater the constraints.  Private property was flagrantly invaded in Watertown, Massachusetts. When tyrants are successful in exercising inordinate power they will continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>We no longer have private property in America.  The internet is devoid of privacy with everything subject to the prying eyes and ears of big brother.  Private homes are no longer sanctuaries but can now be invaded by heavily armed, jack booted government troops who can kill with impunity.  Public safety trumps individual rights leaving citizens without privacy or even the right to occupy of their own property.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Life is no longer restrained by absolutes.  Power prevails and the full force of the United States military can be used to enforce the whims of those that wield it.</span></p>
<p><span>When we forsake God’s Law we subject ourselves to the whims of human power!</span></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/battleofPoitier3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/battleofPoitier2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The year is 632 A.D., and Muslim hordes have set their sights on the Mideast and North Africa — the old Christian world. And the Caliphate, as the Islamic realm is called, will not be denied. Syria and Iraq fall in 636. Palestine is next in 638. And Byzantine Egypt and North Africa, not even Arab lands, are conquered by 642 and 709, respectively. Then, just two years later, the Muslims cross the Strait of Gibraltar and enter Iberia (now Spain and Portugal). The invasion of Europe has begun.</p>
<p>And the new continent seems no impediment to Islam. After vanquishing much of Visigothic Iberia by 718, the Muslims cross the Pyrenees Mountains into Gaul (now France) and move northward. Now it is 732, and they are approaching Tours, a mere 126 miles from Paris. The Western world — what’s left of Christendom — could very well be on its way to extinction.</p>
<p>Europe is currently easy prey, comprising disunited, often belligerent kingdoms and duchies recently decimated by plague. In contrast, the Islamic world is a burgeoning civilization; so much so, in fact, that it views the Europeans as barbarians. The Muslims also command enormous battle-hardened military forces and have enjoyed almost unparalleled breadth and rapidity of conquest, while Europe no longer has standing armies. It largely relies on peasants to do its fighting, men available only when crops aren’t beckoning. Yet the Christian Europeans do have one great asset: Charles of Herstal, grandfather of Charlemagne.</p>
<p>Sensing the coming storm as early as 721, Charles realized he was going to need a professional, well-oiled fighting force if he was to tackle the Moorish wave washing across Christendom. So, using Catholic Church resources, he set out to train just such an army. And now, 11 years later, it will be put to the ultimate test.</p>
<p>With a horde of 80,000 men, the Muslims once again start moving north in 732 under the leadership of Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. And after defeating Odo the Great and sacking his Duchy of Aquitaine, there is nothing standing between Al Ghafiqi and Paris — except Charles of Herstal and his Frankish and Burgundian army. The two leaders would lock horns in October, on a battlefield between the towns of Tours and Poitier.</p>
<p>When the fateful day arrives, Al Ghafiqi is shocked by what lies before him. The “barbarians” have mustered a force the size of which he isn’t used to seeing in these European backwaters. He nonetheless enjoys a great advantage, outnumbering the Christians by perhaps as much as two to one and possessing heavy cavalry, while his adversaries are limited to infantry. The outcome should still be favorable. And it is.</p>
<p>Charles routs the Muslim forces, stopping their advance into Europe cold. He will eventually chase them back across the Pyrenees Mountains, saving Gaul — and perhaps all of Western civilization— from the sword of Islam. His miraculous 732 victory becomes known as the Battle of Tours (or Poitiers), and it wins him the moniker “Martellus.” Thus do we now know him as Charles Martel, which translates into Charles the Hammer.</p>
<p>Yet the Abode of Islam would not stop hammering Christendom. It is now 1095, and the Muslims are threatening Europe from the east. After seizing most of the Byzantine Empire’s territory 400 years prior, they have now, just recently, subdued Anatolia (most of modern Turkey), thus robbing the Byzantines of the majority of their remaining land. The Muslims are now poised to move west into Greece itself or perhaps north into the Balkans — Europe’s “back door.” And Byzantine emperor Alexius I in Constantinople knows that his realm is too weak to resist. What is he to do?</p>
<p>Alexius decides to approach the Church. Although he and current pope Urban II have been rivals, the pontiff recognizes Islamic expansion to be a clear and present danger. So he decides to address the matter at the Council of Clermont in 1095. In a rousing sermon in front of more than 650 clerics and Christian nobles, he appeals to Europeans to stop bickering amongst themselves and rally to the aid of their eastern brothers. What follows is an <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2-fulcher.html">excerpt</a> of his words as recorded by the Fulcher of Chartres:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your brethren who live in the east are in urgent need of your help, and you must hasten to give them the aid which has often been promised them. For, as the most of you have heard, the Turks and Arabs have attacked them and have conquered the territory of Romania [the Greek empire] as far west as the shore of the Mediterranean and the Hellespont, which is called the Arm of St. George. They have occupied more and more of the lands of those Christians, and have overcome them in seven battles. They have killed and captured many, and have destroyed the churches and devastated the empire. If you permit them to continue thus for awhile with impunity, the faithful of God will be much more widely attacked by them. On this account I, or rather the Lord, beseech you as Christ’s heralds to publish this everywhere and to persuade all people of whatever rank, foot-soldiers and knights, poor and rich, to carry aid promptly to those Christians….</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus was born the 11<sup>th</sup>-century Hammer writ large: the Crusades.</p>
<p>Like Martel’s campaigns before them, the Crusades were defensive actions designed to stave off Muslim aggression. Oh, this isn’t what you learned in college, I know. It’s not what we hear from the media. It isn’t what’s portrayed by Hollywood. But it is the truth. And it was explained well by Thomas Madden, Chair of the History Department at Saint LouisUniversity. In “The Real History of the Crusades” he <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/mayweb-only/52.0.html">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Crusades are generally portrayed as a series of holy wars against Islam led by power-mad popes and fought by religious fanatics. They are supposed to have been the epitome of self-righteousness and intolerance, a black stain on the history of the Catholic Church in particular and Western civilization in general. A breed of proto-imperialists, the Crusaders introduced Western aggression to the peaceful Middle East and then deformed the enlightened Muslim culture, leaving it in ruins.</p>
<p>… [But] Christians in the eleventh century were not paranoid fanatics. Muslims really were gunning for them. While Muslims can be peaceful, Islam was born in war and grew the same way. From the time of Mohammed, the means of Muslim expansion was always the sword. Muslim thought divides the world into two spheres, the Abode of Islam and the Abode of War&#8230;. In the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks conquered Asia Minor (modern Turkey), which had been Christian since the time of St. Paul. The old Roman Empire, known to modern historians as the Byzantine Empire, was reduced to little more than Greece.</p>
<p>… [The Crusades] were not the brainchild of an ambitious pope or rapacious knights but a response to more than four centuries of conquests in which Muslims had already captured two-thirds of the old Christian world. At some point, Christianity as a faith and a culture had to defend itself or be subsumed by Islam. The Crusades were that defense.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that is why I defend them today. No, they weren’t perfectly executed, nor could they achieve all their objectives any more than the Cold War truly vanquished the left. Evil is always afoot. But note that the Mideast and North Africa had more Christians than did Europe at the time of the early Muslim invasions — but no one to Crusade for them. Thus, it’s easy to imagine that, were it not for our hammering medieval heroes, we could well be what the Mideast is today. And unless we shelve multiculturalism and become what those crusaders were yesterday, we may not have a tomorrow.</p>

				<p>March 6, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17033#respond" title="Comment on A Busy Executive’s Guide To Why Public Schools Are Dysfunctional"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17033 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17033">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/f-grade-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/f-grade-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>The bleak statistics are well known. This country has 50 million functional illiterates. We don’t compete well on international tests. Students reach college not knowing what 7 x 8 is. The  Pentagon complains constantly that more than half of our teenagers are not fit for military service. Major corporations spend billions on remedial classes, teaching adults basic information they should learn during their school years.</p>
<p>Why, why, why? It’s all very mystifying for most people. What is so difficult about teaching kids to read, write, do simple math, and find the US on a map? </p>
<p><strong>Fact is, elite educators have perversely embraced one flimsy theory after another. All the while, traditional, proven methods are tossed on the trash. If you went back to a public school today, you might not recognize the place.</strong>  </p>
<p>Probably the first thing you would notice is that children no longer sit in desks facing a teacher. Often, they are divided into little groups of five or six students who sit around a table.  This approach is called Cooperative Learning. All work is group-work; praise is group-praise; blame is group-blame. M. J. McDermott in her famous YouTube video “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr1qee-bTZI">An Inconvenient Truth</a>” noted that when she went back to college as a 40-year-old, she was surprised that the kids coming directly from high school had such poor skills: “Common problems included, one, an inability to work alone, to solve problems without checking in with other people all the time&#8230;” </p>
<p>If you want to create independent thinkers and self-starters, Cooperative Learning may be the worst possible approach. If you are trying to create members of a herd, it’s a good choice. </p>
<p>Another disingenuous theory, operating in almost every classroom these days, is called Constructivism. It requires children to invent their own new knowledge. Meanwhile, teachers can no longer be sages on a stage; they must be guides at a student’s side. Even worse, teachers may be relegated to the back of the room, and renamed Facilitators. Their job is to flit quietly about, dispensing smiles of encouragement, while the students try to reinvent the insights and facts generated by 10,000 years of human history. Basically, education becomes Easter egg hunts where kids discover what they are nudged toward discovering. Everything else is terra incognita. Something simple like “Paris is the capital of France” is not easily “constructed.” However, it is quickly taught.</p>
<p>Most people of a certain age remember the horror story known as New Math, circa 1965. It was a flop and it was buried without regret. But the same ingredients were recycled into a witches’ brew called Reform Math (ca. 1985). As before, advanced concepts are mixed with simple concepts. The best methods for solving various types of problems are not taught. Children “spiral” about from topic to topic, but mastery is not a goal. Kids are not asked to know the multiplication tables. Reform Math sparked a massive amount of parental opposition. (Probably that’s why the educators had created 12 separate Reform Math curricula, with different names but the same dark heart.) Now all this failed math pedagogy is being recycled into Core Standards&#8211;Mathematics. You can go to <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">corestandards.org</a> and see for yourself. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that children are moved very quickly to dependence on calculators. They don’t know any techniques in an automatic way. Years later, when they have to add a column of numbers in a restaurant, they’re always starting over as if still in fifth grade.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let us never forget that reading has been in shambles for 75 years. About 2000, the Education Establishment changed gears slightly, allowing more phonics back into the classroom, under the banner of Balanced Literacy. However, first- and second-graders are still forced to memorize printed words as shapes or designs (instead of learning to see the sounds represented by the words). This is the mistake that Rudolf Flesch wrote about in his famous 1955 book, “Why Johnny Can’t Read”. This is the flawed theory that created those already-mentioned 50,000,000 functional illiterates. Tragically, the Education Establishment keeps pushing it.</p>
<p><strong>Next, consider the strategy called Self-Esteem. This requires that students be praised even if they do a bad job. Predictably, students become complacent and smug. But Self-Esteem is much more lethal than that. It is often used to destroy content on this basis: if a child doesn’t learn something, the child will feel bad. What is the answer? Teach the child better? No, never that. The answer is to eliminate everything difficult or challenging from the classroom.</strong></p>
<p>Still another common tactic is called Multiculturalism. This requires that third-grade students learn the history and geography of Africa or China, but not the equivalent facts about their own country. Multiculturalism is used to curtail knowledge about a student’s own world. Recall that a few decades ago, the big fad was Relevance, which required that students learn ONLY those things that were in a child’s immediate world. This theory justified ignoring a lot of history, science, and geography. Point is, our Education Establishment seems always to find a clever excuse for not teaching facts once considered essential.</p>
<p>There’s another strategy almost as devastating as all these others but you don’t often hear it talked about. It is best called No Memorization. Children are never expected to actually know anything. The idea of telling the child that there are three oceans&#8211;Atlantic, Pacific and Indian; <em>remember those names</em> &#8212; is obsolete. The goal now seems to be a fact-free classroom. Children talk about things, but they don’t learn things. Meanwhile, the education professors don’t want testing that will reveal how little the kids actually know. The answer? Students prepare portfolios or projects. You cut pictures from magazines showing the subject you are studying. The teacher says, “You understand this topic; you get an A.” That’s called “authentic assessment.” It’s actually rather inauthentic, as the whole point seems to be to circumvent what used to be considered ordinary standards.</p>
<p>All of these dangerous fads have been thoroughly mixed in with yet another: Learning Styles. In this theory, every child is unique and should probably have an IEP&#8211;Individualized Education Program. Imagine the chaos and anarchy, not to mention huge amounts of extra work, as teachers try to devise a separate curriculum for each student. This is supposedly sensible because some students are visual learners, some are auditory learners, some are kinesthetic learners, some are one kind, some are some other kind. I recently talked to a fifth-grade teacher, a man, who told me that he used no text books. He said he prepared a special assignment for each student, each day. OMG, as the texters say. Even if you can find teachers willing to do all this extra work, there is still the matter of cultural divisions: every kid is learning something different. What can they discuss with each other? Where is our common inheritance?</p>
<p>Finally, all of these dubious theories&#8211;almost a dozen of them&#8211;are forced into schools against a background of routine violence, more cheating, greater tolerance for lateness and incompletions, and a general embrace of approximate answers or fuzziness. (The only thing that public schools are firm about is that students mustn’t carry anything that might be considered a weapon or a drug. Recently, in my part of the country, a sixth-grader was suspended for 10 days because he passed a little bag of oregano from one kid to another. This is insane, but indicative.)</p>
<p><strong>Now you can see why we have millions of students who can’t read very well, can’t count very well, don’t know much history, science or anything else academic, but have been told for years that they are special, talented and wonderful. This is not a good way to prepare children for the real world, a world that may be hard and competitive.</p>
<p>Probably you’re asking about all of this, but why? Are our top educators incompetent? Do they have a foolish weakness for fads and novelty? Is it true that our top education professors have been far-left politically for almost 100 years? Is it simply that these educators are adrift in their own theories, no longer able to see that theory is not reality? I suspect ALL four reasons are synergistically in play, with the politics more important than normally imagined. </strong></p>
<p>Finally, what difference does it make? In all other fields of human endeavor, when the bosses do poorly year after year, they are fired. We don’t have to know why they did a bad job. We just have to know they should be replaced.</p>

<p>If you wonder, why the world is so confused and incoherent, look no further then the concept that <a href="http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/cultural-relativism.htm">All Truth Is Local</a>. &#8220;Cultural Relativism is the view that moral or ethical systems, which vary from culture to culture, are all equally valid and no one system is really &#8220;better&#8221; than any other. This is based on the idea that there is no ultimate standard of good or evil, so every judgment about right and wrong is a product of society. Therefore, any opinion on morality or ethics is subject to the cultural perspective of each person. Ultimately, this means that no moral or ethical system can be considered the &#8220;best,&#8221; or &#8220;worst,&#8221; and no particular moral or ethical position can actually be considered &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>This viewpoint is patently absurd on face value. Yet much of humanity uses <em>&#8220;words like &#8220;pluralism,&#8221; &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; and &#8220;acceptance&#8221; in a loose way in which modern society defines these ideas has made it possible for almost anything to be justified on the grounds of &#8220;relativism.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The article by Gene Howington, <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/2012/10/21/ethical-relativism-a-good-idea-or-a-path-to-anarchy/">Ethical Relativism: A Good Idea or a Path to Anarchy?</a> – cites a compelling example of an indisputable immorality performed that resulted in the deaths of innocents.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of the strongest arguments against ethical relativism comes from the assertion that universal ethical and/or moral standards can exist even if some practices and beliefs vary among cultures. In other words, it is possible to acknowledge cultural differences and still find that some of these practices and beliefs are wrong. Consider that although the Aztec had a society that was in some ways more advanced that their contemporary European counterparts, that their practice of human sacrifice is simply wrong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people seldom analyze their personal behavior in light of such extreme historic atrocities. However, many live a life of individual relativism. The <a href="http://www.lawandbioethics.com/demo/Main/EthicsResources/objectivity_subjectivity.htm">OBJECTIVITY, SUBJECTIVITY, AND MORAL VIEWS</a> site poses the danger of accepting a situation ethics and the risk of adopting the dead end captivity of iconoclasm.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Individual relativism is close to, but should not be confused with, <em>moral nihilism</em>. An individual relativist takes standards seriously perhaps even by going so far as establishing a strict, or burdensome moral code for himself or herself. Under this position, we view the code as binding only for that one person. A <em>nihilist</em>, on the other hand, believes that morality is an illusion. Nothing is really binding, even a code one establishes for oneself. Nihilism about any subject is difficult to overcome, if overcoming it means giving a nihilist reasons adequate to change his or her belief, because the nihilist can continually reject the basis for our reasoning. We may claim that an objective moral code is needed for proper social function, to avoid harm, to do good, to preserve integrity. The nihilist keeps telling us that all of this is an illusion or that each involves an imposed standard.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there really a difference between a personally devised ethical system, which inescapably descends into an abstruseness of conflict and indiscriminate conduct, and the nihilistic delusion that no moral behavior is attainable? Admittedly, each act of moral conscience is individual, but when society promotes a cultural relativism mystique, in order to establish an egalitarian moral neutral acceptance, the glue that binds civilization together breaks apart.</p>
<p>The conventional basis that philosophers acknowledge as foundational for any culture that accepts a deity, is natural law. The University of Tennessee provides an impressive summary of moral thought, in <a href="http://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/vita/research/ages.htm">MORAL PHILOSOPHY THROUGH THE AGES</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional underpinnings that apply Aristotle’s precepts, to Christian teachings are found in <em>Aquinas Natural Law Theory</em>. Aquinas’s account of natural law appears in his &#8220;<em>Treatise on Law</em>,&#8221; a section of his several thousand page <em>Summa Theologica</em> (1a2ae q. 90-144).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In short, for Aquinas, all moral laws are ultimately grounded in God’s unchanging eternal law, and we discover general rules of natural law through intuition. Legal experts then deduce more specific rules of human law from these, and in scriptural divine laws we find examples of both general and specific rules. Since we don’t have access to the complete list of eternal law, from our limited human perspectives morality begins with a search for the general rules of natural law. But where do we begin looking for the general rules of natural law? Aquinas says that we must look to human nature as a guide:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; [each human being] has a share of the Eternal Reason, whereby it has a natural inclination to its proper act and end: and this participation of the eternal law in the rational creature is called the natural law. [<em>Summa Theologica</em>, 1a2ae 90:2]</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Aquinas, when God created us he gave us natural instincts that reflect the general moral principles of natural law. There are two distinct levels of morally-relevant instincts. First, God implanted in us an instinctive intuition that we should pursue our proper human end. Second, God implanted in us a series of instincts that define our proper end as living, reproducing, and rational creatures.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the relevance of submitting yourself unto the authority of divine design is rare in an age of godless cultural relativism. Without a willful acceptance of inspired purpose and rules for prescribed conduct, the barbarism of immoral nihilism is inevitable. Politically, the rages of wicked government repression become institutionalized, and a much greater cruelty, than most cleric domination abuses. One need not be a defender of any particular faith to accept the fundamental <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/index.html">inherent autonomy</a> of your being within the world. Your plight is often proportional to your circumstance, but your morality or lack thereof; is directly tied to the nature of your created soul.</p>
<p>The ontogeny of every individual is a product of social environment, mortal will and providential inspiration. Most of temporal society is geared to combating political disputes or fostering phony promises. Personages cope according to their singular talents and determination to compete. Many reject, from this equation, the role and influence of the muses consorting with your own mythology. Notwithstanding, the very mention of obedience to Almighty God and the submission to His natural law, bears the risk of being burned at the stake of the cultural relativist.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.the-ethical-hacker.com/2013/01/thinking-about-obscurity/">Thinking About Obscurity</a> suggests: &#8220;Obscurity is the idea that when information is hard to obtain or understand, it is, to some degree, safe.&#8221; Alas, this seems to be the current condition of embracing natural law in an age of cultural relativism. Asking for divine inspiration that seeks <em>eternal reason</em> or using your <em>natural instincts</em> to discover everlasting principles, is hidden from the nihilist and their relativist cousins. Their condescending attacks against religion stems from their own inadequacies, while they spend their energy on convincing themselves of the illusion that a world without God is safe for their own form of <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/nahuatl.htm">Nahuatl</a> liturgy sacrifices.</p>
<p>Dr. Edward Younkins provides a strong defense of Western Civilization in his essay, <a href="http://www.quebecoislibre.org/younkins26.html">&#8220;Why the World is the Way It Is: Cultural Relativism and It’s Descendents&#8221;</a>. By including, &#8220;Multiculturalism, racism, postmodernism, deconstructionism, political correctness, and social engineering are among cultural relativism’s &#8220;intellectual&#8221; descendents&#8221;, into this mistaken value system, the stage is set for his valid conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In reality, the superiority of Western culture can be objectively demonstrated when cultures are appraised based on the only befitting standard for judging a society or culture—the extent to which its core values are life affirming or antilife. Prolife culture recognizes and honors man’s nature as a rational being who needs to discern and produce the circumstances that his survival and flourishing require. Such a culture would promote reason, man’s natural rights, productivity, science, and technology. Western culture, the prime example of this type of culture, exhibits levels of freedom, opportunity, health, wealth, productivity, innovation, satisfaction, comfort, and life expectancy unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>Western civilization represents man at his best. It embodies the values that make life as a man possible—freedom, reason, individualism, and man’s natural rights; capitalism, self-reliance, and self-responsibility based on free will and achievement; the need for limited, republican representative government and the rule of law; language, art, and literature depicting man as efficacious in the world; and science and technology, the rules of logic, and the idea of causality in a universe governed by natural laws intelligible to man. These values, the values of Western civilization, are values for all men cutting across ethnicity, geography, and gender.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That so many pseudo intellectuals not only reject this timeless assessment and actually rebel against the natural order of society, demonstrates why the world is such a mess. Diversity of ethnical relativism cries out for a methodical demise. The cultural suicide of civilization is really a crisis in valid moral values.</p>
<p>There is little safety left on a planet that surrenders it individual responsibility to the collective and forgoes any duty to fulfill ones natural purpose. The progressive slough that society proceeds upon only demeans the whole. Abandoning the quest for universal ethics denies our <em>instinctive intuition</em>. In order to fulfill our nature as a <em>rational creature</em>, humanity must believe that rightful moral principles are ubiquitously applicable.</p>
