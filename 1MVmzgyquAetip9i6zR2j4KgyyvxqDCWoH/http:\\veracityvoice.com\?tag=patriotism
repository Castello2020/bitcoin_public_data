<p>Bumper stickers often reflect the quality of the theology that supports American Christianity.  “God said it and I believe it” used to be popular.  “Are You Saved?” was often seen and a whole variety of challenging, pithy phrases continue to appear: “I Love Jesus”, “Jesus Possess Me”, “Know Jesus, Know Peace”, “Love God Love People”, “One Nation Under God”, “Pray for America”, “Got Jesus”, “Victory In Jesus”, “Honk If You Know Jesus”, “Love God Love People”, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The flippant attitude that pervades American Christianity reflects the feeble impact it has on the culture and the progression of Divine Judgment that overshadows us.</p>
<p>Christians often challenge one another with regular sessions of reading “The Word”; for many Christians this means reading the New Testament with an occasional short selection from the Old.  They believe the Old Testament was applicable to another era and consider this new era one of Grace and any reference to law to be “legalistic”.</p>
<p>It is quickly apparent in reading R. J. Rushdoony that his approach to Christian theology is different than the preaching we hear at our local church.  He believes the entire Bible, every word, is the Word of God   From Genesis to Revelation he ponders each word, phrase, and sentence to determine what action his Creator seeks.  Instead of using his reason as a filter he sets it aside to be used as a guide to the actions God requires.  He wants to obey God rather than understand Him.  He does not pick and choose but glories in the entire Biblical narrative.  He tarries with God’s Law since obedience is the foundational requirement of the Covenant God of the Bible.</p>
<p>He embraces the Charismatic Movement as a new and more vibrant recognition of the Holy Spirit but expresses disdain for tongues and the gibberish that that often results. Sinful men are unable to accurately hear the Holy Spirit without the yardstick of His Law.  We are sinful beings and without the restraint of His written Commandments chaos and wickedness quickly overtake us.  Antinomianism in Charismatic circles destroys the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The power and glory of the God of the Bible must emanate from individual Christian men who live by God’s Commandments.  When men abdicate their responsibility to lead their individual families in obedience to the Will of the Creator they open the door for the state to assume that role and to tighten the vise of tyranny.</p>
<p>When the rule of the Creator is torn from its Biblical base and maligned by sinful human minds the strength of the Gospel no longer beams forth.  Instead we have the amoral, adaptable, pragmatic, competitive, social creatures that are popular today.  Men are suspected of being unfaithful and sexually promiscuous.  Those that stand for honesty, righteousness and faithfulness are often mocked by powerful triflers. </p>
<p>Men no longer understand the leadership position God requires of them.   They are responsible for the safety, well-being and conduct of their family.  They are to be the head of their home and to participate in the government of the community in which they live.</p>
<p>Rushdoony writes, ”A society cannot be vital and possessed of an ongoing vigor if the men therein are marked by a loss of faith, a retreat from responsibility, and an unwillingness to cope with personal problems.  A culture loses its will to live and to conquer if its members manifest a spirit of retreat and surrender.”</p>
<p>Role playing has become a pandemic mendacity.  Public forums are full of men who role-play.  During his campaign President Obama promised scores of actions that were popular and needed.  However, when he assumed the office of President he installed programs diametrical to those he promised.  American politicians never produce what they promise; they are puppets playing roles demanded by an unseen power center.</p>
<p>Congresspersons maintain their office as a grant from the closely held press.  They carefully avoid taking positions that defy politically correct media dictates.  They all play a role and the role is inimical to the well-being of our nation. </p>
<p>Men play an unnatural role in their homes when wives often assume equal or superior authority in family life.  Women were created to helpmates to men and when they assume roles for which they were not intended we lose the decisiveness that is a masculine trait.  Men sin by abdicating their responsibilities and women sin by assuming them.</p>
<p>However, even if role-playing ceased and rational thought began we would still be in serious trouble.  Mortal minds will never produce peace, order, and freedom.</p>
<p>Recently, someone sent me an article by Tom Mullen with the audacious title of “Jesus Christ, Libertarian”.  Mullen quotes verbatim Scripture from John 8 about the woman taken in adultery that Jesus forgave with the admonition to go and sin no more.</p>
<p>Mullin tees off on this particular incident with a plethora of dangerous and erroneous conclusions. He writes: “However, no one has a right to use violence against those who engage in behavior that does not harm another person, regardless of whether or not that behavior violates the laws of God.”  Mullin would have his insignificant opinion override the perfect Law of God.  Such arrogance is the fuel for murder and strife.</p>
<p>Mullin has devised a non-violent system but his system is vulnerable to an opposite system devised by a tyrant who has no aversion to the use of violence to achieve his goals – both systems are products of the anarchic minds of men and sans God’s immutable law one is as valid as the other.  Man was not created to govern himself.  Without the overarching, righteous law of the Creator chaos and strife will continue to plague us.</p>
<p>On page 387 of his “Systematic Theology” Rushdoony lists the curses that are visited on disobedient individuals and nations.  First, fallen man lives under the curse of physical death.  Second, he lives under the fear of “sickness, plagues, and epidemics”.  Third, the advent of drought and natural disasters produces fear.  Fourth, poverty lurks in the economies of profligates.  Fifth, nonbelievers are cursed with war, invasion, defeat, conquest, and ultimate captivity.  Sixth, Frustration annoys the intentions of men and nations when they seek their own will instead of following the Will of the Creator. And seventh, Rushdoony laments the curse of blindness that causes millions of Evangelical Christians to ignore the obvious signs of God’s judgment.</p>
<p>It is the curse of blindness that causes us to ignore the obvious poverty and strife that plagues the world’s pagan nations and the bursting prosperity that marked Christian civilization.  When the United States of America was making an effort to obey God’s Commandments she enjoyed unparalleled prosperity.  We have now become a secular nation and not only poverty but all of the other curses are bursting forth.</p>
<p>We have an adequate supply of anti-war spokespersons in the United States but I have yet to find one who espouses the only viable solution.  History is replete with constant warfare.  Men and nations have been engaged in continuous war from the beginning of time.  The Bible contains that legal structure that God gave us to bring lasting peace but sinful men ignore it.  Paul Craig Roberts is a bright and well informed writer.  He writes with commendable insight into the conduct of our nation but he never once mentions the fact the humanistic solutions to perennial war have never been effective and he fails to consider the legal platform God has given us for lasting peace.   His latest article is <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/07/03/july-4th-militarist-bunkum-encore-request/" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>
<p>As America continues to fall into the devil’s abbess will Christians finally wake up and begin to heed the One True God?  Mainline churches will not stem the fall.  Patriotism will not reverse it.  Politics and revolution will not save us.  Guns will not help against the judgment of Almighty God.  Our stubborn failure to repent, follow Him, and obey His commandments may seal our fate.</p>
<p>For several years I wrote about the tyrannical nature of our government.  But government is a reflection of the people who are governed and we have voted for the government we are receiving.  We, the people, are the problem.  The prayer that is need it that the One True God would change our hearts bringing a resolute desire for obedience to God and a resulting righteous government. </p>

<p><strong><em>Any country that is considering waging war against another country should first consider that the loser is almost always the country that runs out of money first.</em></strong></p>
<p>Recently, an associate offered the following observation with regard to the likelihood of war in the immediate future:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The big guys like to play chess with the world. It’s the biggest game. <strong>The bankers need ups and downs and wars to make money. The military needs wars to exist. The politicians need both to exist.</strong>”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst he was reiterating a concept we have discussed on many occasions, it occurred to me that I have never seen the subject defined so succinctly, nor so informatively.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down:</p>
<h4>The bankers need ups and downs and wars to make money</h4>
<p>Just as bankers increase their profit as a result of upward and downward economic fluctuations, so, too, do they benefit from war. It is not unusual for a given bank to finance those who would create armed conflict, and indeed, they sometimes bankroll both sides. Whilst banks have other means of making money, war is often more profitable than conventional banking.</p>
<h4>The military needs war</h4>
<p>The military-industrial complex is in the business of selling armaments to governments. Although armament sales may tick over nicely in peace time, they boom in war time. Therefore, any armament supplier will benefit from war. It matters little whether it is an all-out war or a series of smaller ventures. The object is sales.</p>
<h4>The politicians need both banks and war</h4>
<p>This is true in the sense that politicians need both bankers and an active military to thrive. Political campaigns depend upon funding. Banks and armament suppliers have long been a major source of campaign funds for candidates of the primary political parties. (If each party is well-paid before the election, favourable treatment towards banks and armament suppliers is assured, regardless of which party wins an election.)</p>
<p>But there is further necessity for armed conflict with regard to politicians. First, it is a truism that a country rarely changes leaders during times of war, and nothing is more imperative to the politician than gaining a further term of office.</p>
<p>Second, nothing distracts the voting public like war. If a politician is receiving increased criticism from the voters, a good war can be counted on to get the voters concentrating more on the war than on the politician’s poor stewardship.</p>
<p>Third, governments typically remove the freedoms of a populace over time. Whilst citizens may object to the loss of their freedoms in normal times, they are often more willing to relinquish them “temporarily” in times of war, “for the good of the country.” Not surprisingly, lost freedoms are seldom reinstated <em>after</em> a war.</p>
<p>Consider the words of James Madison, the fourth US President:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Of all the enemies of public liberty, war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the dominion of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended…. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, the citizens of most countries would prefer to avoid war. After all, they rarely benefit from it. But then, the impetus for war is almost never generated by the people of a country. Unless a nation is actually attacked, in nearly every case, the people need to be talked into going to war.</p>
<h4>Convincing the People</h4>
<p>A good example of this is the US, who, since World War I, have needed convincing on almost every occasion when political leaders proposed war. In World War I, the <a href="http://www.internationalman.com/articles/all-that-s-needed-now-is-a-lusitania" target="_blank">Lusitania incident</a> was created jointly by the UK and the US to motivate them. In World War II, the goading of Japan was needed. In Vietnam, the trumped-up <a href="http://www.internationalman.com/articles/making-sure-war-occurs" target="_blank">Gulf of Tonkin</a> incident was needed, and so on.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that, when bankers, the military industrial complex, the politicians, or all three decide to instigate war, war will come to pass. Whether it is a conservative government or a liberal government, if a clear threat does not exist, one will be invented.</p>
<p>As Hermann Goering stated in the Nuremburg trials,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Naturally, the common people don’t want war. But after all, it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>At the present time in history, the countries of the First World have created the greatest pillaging of the state coffers that has ever occurred. As complacent as the peoples of both the EU and the US have been in recent decades, there does seem to be a growing understanding amongst the peoples that they have been scammed.</p>
<p>Aside from continuing quantitative easing until that scam also fails, the respective governments are running out of rabbits to pull out of the hat to distract the masses. It would therefore seem that there has been no time in history in which war was so <em>needed</em>by national leaders—both as a distraction to the populace and as a last squeeze at the monetary lemon, prior to the inevitable crash.</p>
<p>And so, what does that mean to the reader? Assuming he is not invited to take part, shouldn’t the drums of war be of little interest to him? Well, in terms of his own physical safety, that may well be true, but here is an historical fact to consider:</p>
<p><strong><em>Any country that is considering waging war against another country should first consider that the loser is almost always the country that runs out of money first.</em></strong></p>
<p>No venture is more costly than warfare. The EU and the US are bankrupt <em>now</em>. Those presently living in those locales may escape actual duty in the military, but they will unquestionably be expected to pick up the tab through taxation.</p>
<p>Those who presently feel that their obligations to their governments are already barely manageable might wish to consider what they will be, both during and after a major war.</p>

<p>At the onset of the derivatives collapse in 2007/2008 it would have been easy to assume that most of America was receiving a valuable education in normalcy bias.</p>
<p>In 2006, the amount of ego on display surrounding mortgage investment was so disturbingly grotesque anyone with any true understanding of the situation felt like projectile vomiting. To watch the smug righteousness of <em>MSNBC</em> and <em>FOX</em> economic pundits as they predicted the infinite rise of American property markets despite all evidence to the contrary was truly mind blowing. When the whole system imploded, it was difficult to know whether one should laugh, or cry.</p>
<p>The saddest aspect of the credit crisis of 2008 was not the massive chain reaction of bankruptcies or the threat of institutional insolvency. Rather, it was the delusional assumptions of the public that the grand mortgage casino was going to go on forever. There is nothing worse than witnessing the victim of a Ponzi scheme defend the lie which has ultimately destroyed him. As much as I am for people waking up to the nature of the crisis, there comes a point when those who are going to figure it out will figure it out, and the rest are essentially hopeless.</p>
<p>The cultism surrounding the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar is truly mind boggling, and by “cultism” I mean a blind faith in the fiat currency mechanism that goes beyond all logic, reason and evidence.</p>
<p>In recent weeks it has become more visible as global financiers play both sides of the Ukrainian conflict, luring Americans into a frenzy of false patriotism and an anti-Russo-sports-team-mentality. My personal distaste for Vladimir Putin revolves around my understanding that he is just as much a puppet of the International Monetary Fund and international banks as Barack Obama, but many Americans hate him simply because the mainstream media has designated him the next villain in the fantasy tale of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>Open threats from Russia that they will dump U.S. treasury bond holdings and the dollar’s world reserve status if NATO interferes in the Ukraine have been met with wildly naive chest beating from dollar cultists.  I am beginning to see the talking points everywhere.</p>
<p>“Let them dump the dollar, Russia’s holdings are minimal!” Or, “Let them throw out Treasuries, they’ll just be shooting themselves in the foot!” are the battle cries heard across the web. I wish I could convey how insane this viewpoint is, especially in light of the fact that many alternative economic analysts, including myself, have been predicting just such a scenario for years.</p>
<p>Despite the childish boastings of the dollar devout, there is an extraordinarily good possibility that the life of the greenback will be snuffed out in the near term. Here are the facts…</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Russia will not be alone in its decouple from the dollar system. China, our largest foreign creditor, and India (a supposed ally) have clearly sided with Russia on the Ukranian issue. China has stated that it will back Russia’s play in the event that sanctions are brought to bear by NATO, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-crisis-china-back-russia-cold-war-over-crimea-1438650" target="_blank">or if a shooting conflict erupts.</a></p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> China has already been slowly dumping the dollar as a world reserve currency using bilateral trade agreements with numerous countries, including Russia, India, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, etc. These agreements allow FOREX currency swaps and export/import purchases to be made with China without the use of the dollar. China has been preparing itself for a divorce from U.S. economic dependence for at least a decade. The idea that they would actually follow through over political tensions should NOT surprise anyone if they have been<a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-11/24/content_11599087.htm" target="_blank">paying attention.</a></p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> A total drop of the dollar or U.S. treasury bonds by Russia and China would send shock waves through global markets. Russia is a major energy supplier for most of Europe. China is the largest export/import nation in the world. If they refuse to accept dollars as a trade mechanism, numerous countries will fall in line to abandon the greenback as well. The fact that so many Americans refuse to acknowledge this reality is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>The only advantage the U.S. has traditionally offered in terms of international trade has been the American consumer, whose unchecked debt spending partly fueled the rise of the industrialized East, not to mention the biggest credit bubble in history. The role of America as a consumer market is collapsing today, however. The mainstream media and the Federal Reserve can blame the steady decline in retail sales on the “weather” all they want, but negative indicators in global manufacturing often take many months to register in the statistics, meaning, this destabilization began long before the days turned cold.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> China has been shifting away from export dependency since at least 2008, calling for a larger consumer based market at home. This process of enriching the Chinese consumer has almost been completed. The lie that China “needs the U.S.” in order to survive economically needs to be thrown out like the <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90778/8394173.html" target="_blank">utter propaganda it is.</a></p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> China (and most of the world) has ended new dollar purchases for their FOREX reserves, and has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-20/pboc-says-no-longer-in-china-s-favor-to-boost-record-reserves.html" target="_blank">no plans to make new purchases </a>in the future.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> China executed the <a href="http://http//money.cnn.com/2014/02/19/investing/china-treasuries/" target="_blank">second largest dump </a>of U.S. Treasury bonds in history in the past month.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Russia, China, and numerous other countries, including U.S. “allies”, have been calling for the end of the dollar’s world reserve status and the institution of a <a href="http://http//www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html" target="_blank">new global basket currency</a>using the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Even Putin has suggested that the IMF take over administration of the global economy and issue the SDR as a world currency system. This flies in the face of those who argue that the IMF is somehow “American run”. The truth is, the IMF is run by global banks and no more answers to the U.S. government than the Federal Reserve answers to the U.S. government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> The Federal Reserve has been creating trillions of dollars in fiat just to prop up U.S. markets since 2008, and we are still seeing a considerable decline in global manufacturing, retail, personal home sales, and a general malaise in consumer demand. Without a full audit, there is no way to know exactly how much currency has been generated or how much is floating around in foreign markets. Any loss of world reserve status would send that flood of dollars back into the U.S., most likely ending in a hyperinflationary environment.</p>
<p><strong>9)</strong> Another rather dubious argument I see often is the claim that the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury could simply “negate” a Treasury dump by refusing to acknowledge creditor liabilities. Or, that they could simply print what they need to snap up the bonds, much like the German government tried to do during the Weimar collapse. Unfortunately, this plan did not work out so well for the Germans, nor has it worked for any other nation in history, so I’m not sure why people think the U.S. could pull it off. However, this is the kind of cultism we are surrounded by. These folks think the U.S. economy and the dollar are untouchable.</p>
<p>Yes, the Fed and the Treasury could hypothetically erase existing liabilities, but what dollar cultists do not seem to grasp is that the dollar’s value is not built on Treasury purchases. The dollar’s value is built on faith and reputation. If a nation refuses to pay out on its debts, this is called default. A default by the U.S. would immediately damage the reputation of bonds and dollars as a good investment. Global markets will refuse to purchase or hold any mechanism that they think will not earn them a profit. How many investors today are anxious to jump into Greek treasury bonds, for instance?</p>
<p>Finally, it is unwise to operate on the assumption that foreign creditors will accept dollars as payment on U.S. Treasury bonds if they believe the Federal Reserve is monetizing the debt. When Weimar imploded under the weight of currency devaluation, many foreign governments refused to accept the German mark as payment. Instead, they demanded payment in raw commodities, like coal, lumber and ore. Expect that China and other debt holders will demand payment in U.S. goods, infrastructure, or perhaps even land.</p>
<p><strong>10)</strong> Most treasury holdings in foreign coffers are not long term bonds. Rather, they are short term bonds which mature in weeks or months, instead of years. Dollar proponents constantly cite the continued accumulation of treasury bonds by other governments as a sign that the dollar is still desirable as ever. Unfortunately, they have failed to look at the nature of these bond purchases. When China rolls over millions in short term bonds and replaces them with other short term bonds, this does not suggest they have much faith in America’s long term ability to service its debt. It would also make sense that if China had plans to remove itself from the dollar system, they would move into short term bonds which can be liquidated quickly.</p>
<p><strong>11)</strong> China is on the fast track to becoming the largest holder of physical gold in the world. Russia has also greatly expanded its gold purchases. Whatever losses they might suffer from a dump of their Treasury bond investments; it will be more than made up in the incredible explosion in precious metals prices that would follow.</p>
<p><strong>12)</strong> The most common argument against the dollar losing world reserve status has been that such a shift would be “impossible” because no other currency in the world has the adequate liquidity needed to replace the dollar in global trade. These people have apparently not been paying attention to the Chinese yuan. China has been quietly issuing trillions in yuan denominated bonds, securities and currency around the world. Current estimates calculate around $24 trillion created by the PBOC and the banks under its control.</p>
<p>Mainstream talking heads are calling this a<a href="http://ftmdaily.com/daily-briefing/011014/" target="_blank"> “debt bubble.” </a>However, this debt creation makes perfect sense if China’s plan is to create enough liquidity in its currency in order to offer a viable alternative to the U.S. dollar. Linking the yuan to the IMF’s basket currency would complete the picture, forming a perfect dollar replacement while dollar cheerleading-economists stand dumbstruck.</p>
<p><strong>13)</strong> China&#8217;s retreat away from dollar denominated investments has left a hole in the U.S. bond market.  Recently, that negative space was filled by an unexpected source; <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/02/19/investing/china-treasuries/">namely Belgium</a>.  A country whose GDP represents less than 1% of total global GDP buying more U.S. bonds than China?  The whole concept sounds bizarre.  Here is the capital coming from?</p>
<p>Think about it this way &#8211; Belgium is the political center of the European Union and a haven for international financiers.  There are more corporate cronies, lobbyists, bureaucrats, and foreign dignitaries in Belgium than in all of Washington D.C.  But more importantly, <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2012/pr12471.htm">Belgium struck a deal with the IMF in 2012</a> to begin pumping SDR denominated funds into &#8220;low income economies&#8221;.  I would suggest that this funding flows both ways, and that now, the IMF is feeding capital into Belgium in order to buy U.S. Treasury Bonds.  That is to say, the IMF is going to start using smaller member countries with limited savings as proxies to purchase U.S. debt using IMF money.</p>
<p>The ultimate danger of the IMF (run by internationalists, not the U.S. government) pre-positioning itself as the primary buyer of U.S. debt is that when the U.S. finally defaults (and it will), the IMF is likely to become the &#8220;guardian angel&#8221; of the U.S. economy, offering aid in exchange for total administrative control of our financial system, and the institution of the SDR as a world reserve replacement for the dollar.</p>
<p><strong>14)</strong> The serious prospect of regional conflict or world war over tensions between the Ukraine and Russia, Japan and China, the U.S. and Syria, the U.S. and Iran, the U.S. and North Korea, etc., could make the effort of exposing the plan to shift economic power into a one world system centralized under the IMF almost meaningless.  How many people will truly care about the financial power grab by banking elites if it drifts under the surface of catastrophic engineered wars?  They&#8217;ll be too busy hating and fighting artificially created boogeymen to pay attention to the real globalist culprits.</p>
<p>I have been pointing out for quite a long time that globalists need a “cover event”; a disaster, an economic war or a shooting war, in order to provide a smokescreen for the collapse of the dollar. Alternative analysts have been consistently correct in predicting the trend towards the dump of the dollar. Years ago, we were laughed at for suggesting China would shift towards a consumer based economy and away from U.S. dependence. Today, it is mainstream news. We were laughed at for suggesting that nations like Russia and China would drop the dollar as a reserve currency. Today, they are already in the process of doing it. And, we were laughed at for suggesting that Russia or China would use their debt holdings as leverage against the U.S. in the event of a geopolitical conflict. Today, they are openly making threats.</p>
<p>I have to say, I’ve grown tired of the dollar cultists. How many times can a group of people be wrong and still argue with those who have been consistently right? The answer is that zealots never actually escape their own delusions, even when their delusions lead them and those around them to ruin. I suspect that in the face of complete dollar collapse, they will still be rationalizing the chaos and pontificating on our &#8220;lack of understanding&#8221; while the theater burns down around them.</p>

<p>No, I don’t mean some place in the Ukraine.  For some of you who went to public school, Connecticut is in the north-eastern corner of the US, but barely.</p>
<p>I understand your confusion since Connecticut is closer to New York City than to the US.  Let’s see how Connecticut politicians constructed a situation where honest gun owners could get shot by police.  We can also prescribe a peaceful solution.</p>
<p><b>How did they get themselves into this mess?</b>  There was a huge outcry of public anguish and frustration after a crazy man murdered children at a public school in Connecticut.  The media used that emotional reaction to sell its anti-gun bigotry.  The media falsely claimed that mass murder by honest gun owners was increasing.  Yes, it is bigotry.  Bigotry is blaming the innocent, and a hundred million honest gun owners are innocent.  They don’t shoot school children, but that didn’t stop the media from blaming them.  The media blamed people like me.  Maybe they blamed you.</p>
<blockquote><p>-Politicians used a public tragedy for political gain.  In an equally crazy reaction, politicians said they would do something, do anything, even if it made us less safe.  They outlawed common firearms.  Connecticut politicians ignored the rights of the voters in doing so.  They also ignored the facts about mass violence.  The reason is simple.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Connecticut politicians put their political careers ahead of public safety.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connecticut gun owners protested as the anti-gun bill went through the legislature, but they were ignored by the Democrat majority.  After the Democrat politicians outlawed common firearms, the citizens returned the favor.  Connecticut gun owners largely ignored the new laws.</li>
<li>Politicians exposed their ill will.  Some gun owners registered their guns as dictated.  Others ignored the new regulations.  Those who registered their firearms late were rejected and <a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2014/02/connecticut-tells-gun-owners-destroy-or-hand-over-rifles-standard-capacity-magaznies/" target="_blank">ordered to sell their firearms out of state or surrender them to police.</a>  That proves gun registration was never the point of the anti-gun legislation.</li>
<li>Gun owners asked the state police if they would go door to door and seize firearms.  The police said they would follow orders.  <a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2014/02/ct-state-police-would-participate-in-gun-confiscations/" target="_blank">Police spokesmen also questioned the patriotism</a> of Connecticut gun owners.  Wise policemen do not deliberately alienate and frighten honest citizens.  Some Connecticut police are not that smart.</li>
<li>Connecticut newspapers called for door-to-door searches and gun confiscation.  That further frightened Connecticut gun owners.  The idea of midnight no-knock raids frightens me too.  It should frighten you.</li>
<li>-The gun law was challenged in court, but lower courts refused to enjoin the legislation until the appeal is completed.  This means the legislature and police can trample the rights of Connecticut gun owners for years to come.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>In total</b>, legislators, judges and the media showed stunning bigotry and lack of respect for political minorities.  Their bias is as blatant as watching a southern judge during the Jim Crow era.</p>
<p><b>Where we are today?</b>  Connecticut has an unenforceable law on its books.  So many gun owners refused to follow the law that Connecticut does not have the physical or fiscal means to enforce their law.  The ranks of law enforcement, the number of courts, and the number of prisons would have to grow ten fold.  The costs of court trials and prison incarcerations are enough to bankrupt the state.  There are other costs as well.</p>
<div>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hSo37wpKaNI" height="281" width="500" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><b>How could the situation get worse?</b>  Police have murdered innocent civilians during no-knock raids.  It is a sad fact, but it <b>has</b> happened.  Examples are <a title=" Home&gt; U.S. Man Dies in Police Raid on Wrong House" href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95475" target="_blank">here 1</a> and <a title="police-kill-80-year-old-man-in-his-bed-after-claiming-his-house-smelled-like-meth" href="http://www.policestateusa.com/2013/police-kill-80-year-old-man-in-his-bed-after-claiming-his-house-smelled-like-meth/" target="_blank">here 2</a> and <a title="Cop's Shot Innocent Man 16 Times While In Bed" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSo37wpKaNI" target="_blank">a video here 3.</a>  Though the media will try and cover for them, police and politicians will have blood on their hands if they injure civilian gun owners during firearm confiscation.  Police violence will further heighten the fear felt by honest gun owners in Connecticut.  Connecticut gun owners could try to defend themselves if people violently break into their homes.  This could lead to further bloodshed for all concerned.  Police and politicians would then be seen as murderous oppressors rather than defenders of a fair and impartial justice system.</p>
<p>Respect for Connecticut law enforcement and politicians would plummet even further.  Law enforcement officers would lose community support.  Crime and violence would increase.</p>
<p>That is bad.</p>
<p>The police could conduct door to door sweeps with armed and armored personnel carriers rolling down the street as they did after the Boston Marathon bombing.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, Connecticut could become a police state over this politicized issue.</strong></p>
<p>That is worse.</p>
<p><b>Is forced disarmament necessary?</b>  Going door to door in no-knock midnight raids is foolishly dangerous.  It is also profoundly unnecessary.  Honest gun owners present no danger to the public.  They never did.  If Connecticut gun owners are a threat at all, they threaten the public image of bigoted politicians who now look politically foolish and publicly inept.</p>
<p><b>How can this situation de-escalate peacefully?</b>  There are lawsuits in place against the Connecticut gun law.  Let the judicial process work to protect the rights of minorities.  Enjoin the law as the case slowly grinds its way through the courts.</p>
<p>The political solution is to lobby the legislators in person, and some online media have posted lists of legislators who supported gun confiscation.  Some politicians view that publicity with alarm.  They are wrong.  You should not be a politician if you don’t want to see the faces of the people affected by your laws.  An isolated and insulated ruling class is a sure way to violence.</p>
<p>Let the courts settle this.</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/images.jpeg" /><strong>There is now a New American War.  It is inside America. It is called</strong> <strong>the “War on Terror”. The enemy is YOU!<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It is a staged, Phony War that has been created by the International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS).</p>
<p><strong>This New War on Terror has an enemy. That enemy is the American People, You and Me.</strong></p>
<p>Every Military Force needs an enemy.<strong> </strong>Without an ongoing or perpetual war, the War profiteers quickly go bankrupt.</p>
<p><strong>In order to keep their profit stream going from war, war-profiteers need to create successive new wars or a significant threat of impending war.</strong></p>
<p>Creating pretexts for these much needed wars is very hard work and quite expensive too. But war is a business, a very big business, and war-profiteers need to invest big money to make even more in return.</p>
<p><strong>Members of Congress must be bought, and top Generals and Admirals of the Military High Command too.</strong></p>
<p>This costs a great deal of hard cold cash, but that’s okay because the IZCS gets all it needs from fat US foreign aid to Israel, fat contracts with Israeli Defense providers, and fat donations from those wealthy zionist businessmen that the IZCS manipulates, guilts or shakes down.</p>
<p>At this point, a select group of 70,000 K-Street Lobbyists go to work distributing funds to get elected officials on Board. The several select Generals and Admirals are handled more covertly.</p>
<p>If this is not enough revenue to pay off the necessary officials, the IZCS gets the rest directly from its private Central Banksters who can create all the money they want digitally, anytime they want, and give it to tribal brothers or anyone else, anytime they want.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course the key thing here is a significant portion of these fat revenues are kicked back to the corrupt, bought and owned members of Congress who voted for them, and to select top Generals and Admirals of the High Military Command who support the IZCS intended proxy wars by America on their behalf.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under President Obama’s Administration, for whatever reasons, the High Military Command has not been willing to take payoffs and favors and has not been blackmail-able by the IZCS.</p>
<p>[Note: this is a long article and one option is to read the caps first and then any areas you are interested in if you have time]</p>
<p><strong>Here is the new game in the so-called American Defense Industry. </strong> It is a stateside game and it involves magically transforming any and all innocent, Constitutional, law-abiding citizens into Domestic Dissenters, aka “Domestic Terrorists” or something close enough to declare war on “Potential Domestic Dissenters, aka “Potential Domestic Terrorists”. This is an occult, alchemical symbolic processing of the American people (aka “we the people”) into an defined domestic enemy that can be waged war against on many fronts–phone and email tapping, massive spying and infiltration of all domestic groupings, even neighborhood coffee parties or local church charities–you name it, everything.</p>
<p><strong>This new redefinition of normal law-abiding Americans into “Enemies of the State” and its internal security apparatus</strong> as a threat to national security <strong>IS</strong> a magical conversion or transformation of the normal American Society, mainstream law abiding America, into a huge domestic national security market. This is all an horrendous BIG LIE.</p>
<p>Actually the real situation is just the opposite–it is the USG and specifically the Fusion Centers and the Department of Homeland Security run by perverts and enemies of “we the people” that are the real risk to the true and actual national security of America the republic and to all honest, law abiding, Constitutional Americans. And the USG and DHS and Fusion Center officials are nothing less than world class criminals committing both High Treason and Sedition against America the Republic. The USG has been hijacked and is being run by those who have turned everything upside down.</p>
<p>This redefinition of course involves placing cameras and microphones on almost every street corner in the light-poles and pulsed beam psychotronic generators in many street lamps, turned on full power during rush hour to sedate and subdue the populace in order to keep the masses in line.</p>
<p><strong>Some say that the new Chairman of the JCS, General Martin Dempsey, is a breath of fresh air, a real American Patriot</strong> who honors his Oath to defend the US Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>So far, General Dempsey has resisted major efforts to coerce him to support and engage in any new major American Mideast Air and Ground invasion (another American proxy war for Israel).</p>
<blockquote><p>And many believe that our new Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is another America-firster who takes his oath to defend the US Constitution seriously also.</p></blockquote>
<p>JCS Chairman Dempsey’s independence and commitment to America on this matter has elevated him to the status of a “rock star” in the view of many who appreciate his steadfastness, and he is regarded as a true America-firster.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some experts view JCS Chairman Dempsey’s integrity and commitment to America the Republic as a major turning point, signaling the realization by the High Military Command that the 9/11 attacks were an inside-job, a false-flag attack run by the IZCS with the help of several Traitors within the USAF, JCS, and NORAD.</p>
<p>And that it also signals a shocking realization, for the first time, that most of the Institutions of the USG have been deeply hijacked by the IZCS and their Cutouts have included the Bush Cabal which is now struggling to maintain a thin hold on power.(1)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Obviously, Chairman Dempsey’s and Defense Secretary Hagel’s steadfast resistance to being manipulated by the IZCS</strong> into fighting another major Mideast ground and Air proxy war for Israel appears to be driving the IZCS to desperation.  So far these America-firsters are holding fast against any and all IZCS manipulations and pressure and doing an excellent job staying on course.</p>
<p>The IZCS knows that unless it gets another American proxy war in the Mideast for Israel, they are finished.  They also know that if the American masses ever start finding out that 9/11 was planned and controlled by those owned by the IZCS, they are done too.</p>
<p><strong>Actually the 9/11 attacks of the IZCS were in a sense a going-for-broke gamble</strong> of everything they have against the House (America the Republic). There is a very strong new American Populism which is emerging rapidly as a spontaneous by-product of the world-wide Internet and the Alternative news it carries, which provides truth to the masses for the first time.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Top insiders know all the names of who did the 9/11 inside-job false-flag attacks and are are ready to testify</strong> if an independent prosecutor is assigned and a special Grand Jury is called, and appropriate  immunity agreements are offered for “coming clean”. At least one, Steve Pieczenik, MD, Ph.D., (former Assistant Secretary of State and father of many deep cover black ops, and also the main character in many Tom Clancy books) has already gone public and named names and has said he is willing to testify in a Federal Court as to who did it.(2) Obviously Dr. Pieczenik is another great American Hero.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Some top insiders close to to the High Command have suggested that America is so deeply hijacked by the IZCS</strong> that it will take some years of the actions of high officials like JCS Chairman General Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to turn the tide and neutralize the rampant influence peddling of the IZCS over almost every member of Congress and many officials in the Department of Justice and the Alphabets.</p>
<blockquote><p>Certainly the Department of Homeland Security is now recognized as a major IZCS beach-head inside America and part of a long term plan to establish a foreign controlled IZCS neo-Bolshevik military force inside America to Tyrannize, wage war against, and eventually serially mass murder most Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why some top insiders refer to DHS as the New American Gestapo or Stasi.  Some see it now morphing into a New Red Cheka mass-murder machine for dispensing Bolshevik-style Red Terror and mass-murder to Americans.</p>
<p><strong>The Cold War was a great boon to the defense Industry even though it never went hot anywhere but Korea and Vietnam, which were limited to prevent an all out nuclear exchange.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The first Iraq War (aka the Gulf War) under Bush1 resulted from covert trickery using Kuwaiti cross drilling, which was reported to Saddam Hussein by April Glaspie, who convinced him that the USG wouldn’t care if he invaded Kuwait to stop the theft of his oil from his main oil field. The second Mideast war was an Invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan to get even with the alleged perps who supposedly did the 9/11 attacks, but actually never were involved at all.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>President Obama is now unwilling to deploy American troops in any major new American land war or massive air bombardment campaign in the Mideast.</strong> Nor is the current US Military High Command willing to allow it at this time. In order to appease the so-called Defense Industry and their lobbyists, he has apparently deployed numerous teams of “special operators” and mercenaries but these have been fighting terrorists supported by America, a self-defeating exercise.</p>
<p>He has also continued to deploy drones with air-to-ground missiles to mass murder numerous innocent women, children and non-combatants. All these Mideast and African wars are illegal, unConstitutional, undeclared and unprovoked.  They have been sold to the American People and the Congress based on the BIG LIE that they are preemptive strikes necessary to prevent any more 9/11 attacks.</p>
<blockquote><p>The need for preemptive strikes to prevent terrorist attacks inside America is an obvious lie for numerous reasons. Anyone who examines all the available evidence on 9/11, including the BBC live TV announcement by Jane Standley that WTC7 fell to the ground 20 minutes before it happened (due to top MI-6 control officers forgetting about American Daylight savings time (too much personal coke use perhaps?).(3)</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, if DHS’s main concern is spying on normal Americans who dissent and crushing them because DHS believes they are “domestic terrorists or “potential Domestic terrorists” or “lone wolf” spontaneously emerging domestic terrorists, this obviates any lies about the need for preemptive foreign attacks. The reason?  Because DHS now claims that the emergence of these ordinary lone wolf domestic terrorists inside America is a spontaneous phenomenon, as well as a completely independent problem that has nothing to do with foreign terrorists in the Mideast.</p>
<p>And beside DHS allows open borders, “sanctuary cities” where illegals can not be checked for legal immigration status, given traffic tickets for minor violations, and must be granted drivers licenses and social security cards without any proof of residency. Plus, thousands of Mideast Immigrants are allowed in to America when there is already a shortage of jobs, and the Muslim Brotherhood is invited into the White House to meet with President Obama.(4)</p>
<blockquote><p>It is obvious that as the major American Defense Contractors who are either owned or controlled by the IZCS have realized that American Mideast war efforts are waning and have worked hard to create their phony War on Terror, first in foreign countries and now in America.</p>
<p>They have worked hard to generate massive public fear in reaction to the 9/11 attacks in order to engender public support and vast expenditures of taxpayer dollars for a large national security market and internal security apparatus, like the Fusion Centers and its specialized assassination teams disguised as corporate or political protection squads, the DHS and the TSA with its Vipr Teams.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This phony, staged War on Terror has been very craftily engineered</strong> to be an unending war that will assure perpetual war profits for Defense Contractors and a perpetual supply of artificially created enemies inside America to feed that war. How is this possible you might ask?</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/youareterror2.jpg" width="300" height="145" />This new War on Terror has been socially engineered</strong> to provide a continual stream of degradations and provocations against the average American, provoking many in a never-ending stream to resist, and causing them to be labeled dissenters.</p>
<p>Once they have been labeled dissenters they are put on a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Main Core Terror Watch List, which top insiders know is a targeted assassination list for later eradication of all Freedom-loving Americans who want to restore the American Constitutional Republic.</p>
<blockquote><p>At present the Main Core list has over ten million Americans on it, and it is growing every day with thousands of new additions. Get a ticket for a driving offense or any arrest (even if later proven innocent) and it is highly likely you will be placed on this Main Core Terror Watch and Assassination list.</p>
<p>If you have a prior drug arrest many years ago or any arrest, it is likely you have already been placed on this list. If a USG web troll or fusion Center Officer comes across any patriotic postings or anything they consider subversive like the East German Stasi, that poster will likely be placed on this list.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Over time these provocations are designed to result in a continuing stream of America dissenters</strong> that want to take their Republic back from the zionist hijackers and will meet DHS tyranny and force with the like. Any and all Dissenters are now being defined as “Enemies of the State”.</p>
<blockquote><p>And anyone who wants to restore the American Republic will also be defined as a “Domestic Terrorist”. DHS is a terrorist group, hand assembled by American/Israeli dual citizen Traitors and is designed to tyrannize, capture and eventually be deployed against Americans to serially mass murder them.  This is why they have been called the New American Gestapo of the Neo-Bolshevik Red Cheka Terror Machine.</p>
<p>If you were a Ron Paul supporter or a Libertarian, you are likely on the Main Core list. If NSA routine scans of any and all of your digital emissions and have picked up enough key trigger words, then you have perhaps already been placed on the List. After all, Marcus Wolfe the former head of the East German Stasi, a vicious torturer and murder of innocent Germans, was hired as a USG consultant to set up DHS two years before he died.(5)<strong><br />

<p>Note the recent admission by US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia that it is without question that the Prison Camps now being built by the USG will eventually be used just like they were in WW2 when innocent Japanese Citizens were wrongly captured, completely asset stripped and placed in USG Prison Camps. (6)</p>
<p><strong>President Eisenhower was an insider placed in position by the Rockefellers</strong> early in his Military career and eventually propelled into the Presidency by them. But even Ike started being bothered by strong pangs of Patriotism and became alarmed at the undue influence of the Military Industrial complex over Congress. In his final public speech as President, he delivered a warning to Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Ike never imagined that the Israelis would serve as the chief action agent for the City of London zionists</strong> and would eventually hijack, buy off, bribe, compromise or honey-trap almost every single member of Congress and also use their vast Central Bankster and manipulated donor funds to hijack almost all American defense and Intel contractors and American communication companies, many of which have been moved to Israel or have been located there in the first place.</p>
<p>Originally his speech included the phrase Military, Industrial, Congressional Complex.  He took out “Congressional” after his political aides informed him that this could end up harming the Republican Party. When he referred to “Military” in the phrase “Military Industrial Complex”, he was actually thinking of the whole new peacetime defense Industry, which was driving the Military Industrial Complex and formation of a permanent armament industry.</p>
<p><strong>Ike became concerned that this permanent armament industry could assert undue influence</strong> on the American political process and could hijack American society and harm its spiritual character.</p>

<p><strong>Disarming the public is a key goal of the IZCS</strong> for everyone in America but them and their stooges at the DHS and the Alphabets or their militarized police now trained by the ADL.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hitler-300x216.jpg" width="300" height="216" />Many Police Chiefs are taken to Israel on all-paid Anti-Terror training Junkets where they drink the Kool-aid and are subjected to some of the most sophisticated Psi powered and Psychotronic mind-kontrol ever deployed. In years past, many were given lavish gifts and provided personal escorts of their age and choice. Perhaps this practice continues?</p>
<p>Any Tyrannical Government must always get rid of we the people’s guns in order to be able to stay in power and concentrate it. A major goal of any tyranny, like what we have in IZCS-hijacked America now, is to gain maximum power by eliminating (as in serial mass-murdering) all political opponents and dissenters. Doubt this? Then check world history the last couple of hundred years.</p>
<p>The USG and DHS is now ramping up the militarization of the Police of American Cities and Suburbs under DOD Program 1033 under the ‘Transfer of Excess Military Property to Local Police Program”.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a video from ‘TheLipTV’, “Over the last decade, we have seen over 5,000 people killed by police in the United States,” when “4,489 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the Iraq war. Since 9-11, you are 29-times more likely to be killed by a police officer than you are by a terrorist.”(7)</p></blockquote>
<p>Most local urban and suburban police departments have been “militarized”, that is, received heavy armament including armored cars, MP5 and M-16 fully-automatic machine guns, grenades, grenade launchers and ballistic shields.</p>
<p><strong>We the people are the new enemy of the militarized police. </strong>The police were set up to “protect and serve”, but their new mission is to wage war against “we the people” on behalf of the IZCS and the ADL.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Every military force must have a designated enemy. The common American is the new enemy of the now militarized police in their new war against Americans on behalf of the IZCS and the ADL.</p>
<p>Whether they realize it or not, the ADL has trained most police to view most Americans (we the people) as the enemy of the police and the Nation State. Ever attended a police training seminar put on by the ADL? Often they hide who really is running it. It’s the biggest bunch of twisted, sick paranoid crap one can ever imagine, and all designed to make police trigger-happy murderers of any citizen who questions their authority in any way or questions any detainment or arrest. Yes, ADL training is a crafty set of lies that produces trigger-happy cops who believe there is a domestic terrorist hiding behind every bush who want to murder them so the police cannot go home to their family at night.</p>
<p>This paranoid belief system will eventually produce this result as a self-fulfilling prophecy, as police tyranny and trigger-happy police continue to murder the innocent and use grossly excessive force for minor offenses. Almost all police abuse of the citizen is delivered “for your own safety”, when that is another big lie.  It is done for the arrogance and authority complex of the police officer–an artifact of over 25 years of ADL training for your local police, who have almost all sold out to the feds in order to get military weapons and gear.  All in return for signing over jurisdiction to DHS and the Feds.</p>
<p>Police are instructed to “charge up” anyone who questions them in any way, and any slight hesitation must be met with false charges of assault and/or battery towards the officer. Officers are told, an arrestee can beat the rap, but they cannot get out of the “ride” (i.e. the arrest and hassle of it.) They are taught that this deters deviance and crime, when actually it provokes the American people to hate police officers.</p>
<p><strong>The new militarized police have one new main function.</strong>  It is to continually provoke law-abiding, honest citizens with acts of selfishness and tyranny in order to “role force” them to act out so that “punishment” can be delivered.  The goal, especially with inner urban kids is to make sure they are sold all the drugs they want, in order to dirty them up and get them into the system for life. Big prisons are a private business–a very big business–and quotas or guaranteed imprisonment rates are in place to reduce costs.</p>
<p>Since the IZCS is actually functioning as a neo-Bolshevik political block with East German Stasi and Nazi undertones, this reveals the actual goal of DHS–to serially mass-murder all American dissenters and political opponents. Doubt this?  Then consider the purchase of over 2 Billion 40 Caliber hollow-point rounds and 7,000 M-16 fully-automatic (real assault rifles, not the mere look-a-like AR-15) and thousands of armored vehicles and armored booths, raised spy-towers and grenade launchers.(8) Many of these armored vehicles have been given to local police who have Police Chiefs who are Traitors to America the Republic in exchange for complete submission to Federal Jurisdiction of DHS.</p>
<p><strong>Some of these traitors are just stupid and overly impressed by Feds or DHS Spooks</strong>, others have been paid off in very large cash donations (hundreds of thousands of USD in military duffel bags, untraceable CIA drug profits. Some have been sexually compromised by Pedophile or Honey Traps and then blackmailed into submission. Some have succumbed after being threatened or having their families threatened. This is the lowest scum-bag manipulation (aka Humint) ever deployed, and it is everyday stock and trade for the IZCS, the world’s biggest sexual compromisers, and pedophile and sex-slave operators.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons of History: </strong>Any serious study of History quickly shows that war is a vehicle for a nation’s leaders to maintain control over their nation-states. The infamous Iron Mountain Report gave an inside glimpse of how the super-elite criminal Psychopaths running America thought about the need for ongoing war or a suitable state crisis to unify the society and solidify their control over society.</p>
<p><strong>Wars are craftily engineered </strong>by criminal super-elites who rule nation-states and their advisers. There are various, crafty ways for a nation’s leaders to covertly start wars. The well-established standby is to stage False-Flag attacks and then wage war on the nation state or entity that you have framed for the attack that you did.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another way to create a terrorist with a long and successful track record is to capture abandoned children in Mideast Countries, provide for their daily needs, while mind-kontrolling them to become terrorists with psychotic suicidal delusions of revenge toward what has been identified to them as their religious enemy which needs destruction to please their god.</p>
<p>The British, the Israelis, and the Saudi are experts at this, and American Taxpayers have unknowingly provided a large portion of the funding for this. One trick well known among intel insiders is the practice of acts of terror against the nation of the mind-kontrolled children to create an enemy for them to later attack in revenge.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Lots of American Taxpayer dollars were covertly dispensed to create and finance terrorists for future Mideast wars.</strong> American Intel has spent a great deal of money paying others,  such as the Israelis, to do this. Otherwise, American Intel has not been very successful themselves.  Their only real success is their arming, funding and training of the Mexican Drug Cartels and the training and deployment of the disgusting mass-murdering death squads in Central and South America, who murdered over one hundred thousand innocent women, children and young men.(9)</p>
<p><strong>The 9/11 attacks were an inside job by the USAF and the IZCS.</strong> The staged Gladio-style False-Flag attack was the choice selected for the attack on the Twin Towers in NYC and the Pentagon in Washington, DC, on 9-11-2001. This attack was done by the USAF, under the authority of a zionist-controlled Criminal Cabal inside the JCS and the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).(10)</p>
<blockquote><p>The 9/11 attack was planned, set up and run by NeoCon top Policy-Makers, Israeli Intel and their stateside Sayanims, utilizing a small criminal cabal inside the USAF, NORAD and the JCS. These are facts that can no longer be disputed by any reasonable person who has examined all the available evidence.</p>
<p>And it is exceedingly clear to any reasonable person who examines the pre-announcement of WTC-7 destruction that the whole attack was pre-scripted in London and Israel, and that WTC-7 was wired in advance with conventional demolition charges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Typically, it takes a considerable amount of time and labor to wire up a building, which suggests complete access at the security level.  This means that since it was a federalized building, with CIA and NYC Emergency Center occupants, building security had to be involved one way or another. And now that it has been proved that WTC-7 was wired up beforehand and demo’ed on 9-11, this means the Twin Towers had to have been pre-wired, too.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>The War on Terror is obviously a Phony.</strong> But it has been the greatest boon to the American Defense Complex ever, with many times more net American Taxpayer dollars spent on this war than any other war in history, including WW2 or the Vietnam War.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to establish a war is to create and fund so-called foreign terrorist groups.</strong> This is a costly exercise that take years and can involve as much work as fighting a war.  Yes, creating terrorist groups is very hard and expensive work.</p>
<blockquote><p>But enemies for necessary wars can be created if you have the technological help of a nation that has hundreds of years experience in creating its own enemies. This nation is the City of London (Financial District), a separate nation state like the Vatican, located within England.</p>
<p>There is a reason England has been referred to as “Perfidious Albion” for centuries. They have been known for their ability to instigate chaos inside nations they want to control by their standard well-developed strategy of “Divide and Conquer”. They are experts at creating long term provocations between different nations that have competing economic interests.</p>
<p>They do this in order to establish a beach-head from which to control the removal of natural resources and accrued wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember the Opium Wars</strong> (Boxer Rebellions) where England brought opiate addiction to China as a covert act of war in order to recover all the silver and gold paid to import Tea, spices and silk from China? This was low intensity (covert) warfare that twice led to a short hot war.</p>
<p><strong>The creation of the nation state Israel was created to serve as a long term provocation for numerous Mideast perpetual wars.</strong> This is why the Balfour Declaration was made, why the Nazi sent the “low Jews” to the labor camps, while the “High Jews” were able to either emigrate elsewhere or become collaborators like George Soros.</p>
<p>This is why the City of London created the New Israel and took land away from the Palestinians to set up a nation of Khazarian Judaic converts (aka “fake Hebrews”), a racially paranoid group mind-kontrolled to believe the delusion that they were of ancient Abrahamic Hebrew Blood.</p>
<blockquote><p>The IZCS believes in preemptive strikes against Goyim and their institutions. Judaics have also been mind-kontrolled by Zionists (many of whom are not Judaics at all) to believe that they must hijack the American political system to preemptively crush Christianity and American Goyim Culture.</p>
<p>And that if they didn’t succeed in this, they would be persecuted again, just like what they call the “holocaust”–translated from Old English as “a fiery sacrifice”.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/38783-israel-killing-machine2.jpg" width="276" height="248" /><strong>This philosophy of striking first</strong> and eliminating the Goyim to prevent another “holocaust” from ever occurring” is a Bolshevik ideology based on the “End Justifies the Means”.</p>
<p>This paranoid strike-first obsession will produce push back and persecution eventually, thus serving as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Of course the Zionists who control Talmudic, Noahide Judaism know that the 6-million-dead figure is untrue, because this had appeared in the late 1800′s andearly 1900′s in Judaic literature long before the work camps of WW2.</p>
<p><strong>New Genetics research exposes a vast, paranoid race-based delusion.</strong> Recent Johns Hopkins genetic research has shown conclusively that approximately 80% of the Palestinians are of Hebrew (Abrahamic) bloodlines, and approximately 90% of Judaic converts living in greater Israel are not of ancient Hebrew (Abrahamic) bloodlines. Thus, the world’s greatest anti-Semites appear to be Israelis who have stolen Palestinian land and continue to do so against all UN rulings and International Law.</p>
<p><strong>The nation of Israel was set up as the private nation state and Tribal Intel front for the City of London Zionist private Central Banksters</strong>, to serve as a beach-head to control the production and distribution of Mideast oil. This delusion that the Khazarian Judaic converts were God’s Chosen People (ancient Hebrews from the Ten Tribes) was then en-cultured into these Judaics who were sent to Palestine and armed so they could use terrorism to expand their region of control.</p>
<p>Greater Israel has no real boundaries and is ever expedient, as Israeli militants keep taking land and murdering unarmed Palestinians.</p>
<blockquote><p>A serious spell, a racial delusion of superiority has been cast on many Judaics no matter where they live, but especially so among those living in greater Israel, where the Luciferian Hex Flag flies. Whether true or not, the flag signifies the merger of demonic fallen angel Beast-Bloodlines from above, bred with Human female bloodlines below.</p>
<p>If we accept this Hex Flag at face value, does this mean that the top Zionists running the IZCS are perhaps alien/human hybrids, or at least claim to be in their own secret ceremonies that Stew Webb has exposed numerous times in articles and radio appearances over many years?<strong><br />
</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It is obvious that the IZCS has hijacked the US Department of State and the US Military Defense Complex as well as Congress. Listen to what Kay Griggs had to say about this.  She was married to a top USM officer and mind-kontrolled “wetboy” who became out of control and beat her and then tried to have her shut up. He and/or his controllers serious stalked and harassed Kay Griggs for years.</p>
<p>She went to live with Sarah McClendon for protection and was interviewed by Pastor Rick Strawcutter, which probably raised her profile so much that it saved her life.  Kay is another Great American Hero and is a courageous standup person, one of the best you could ever meet anytime, anyplace. If you get a chance, be sure and listen to her 8-hour video affidavit with Pastor Rick Strawcutter, who is another Great American Hero. You will be amazed and angered at who has been running the USG and the Military.(11)</p>
<p>Kay’s video affidavit is packed with insider secrets known only by top Intel insiders. How much do you want to know about what is really going on in the background? How much do you dare to pull the curtain back to expose the Wizard Of Oz (as in Ounce)? You will need a great deal of courage to handle what Kay Griggs reveals. By the way, a great deal of her testimony has been cross-corroborated by experts.  Any errors she makes are minor and not directly related to her main claims.</p>

<p><strong>Two sides of the same coin:</strong> Of course those on the inside of the Ruling Cabal know that Nazi-ism and Zionism are two sides of the same coin and run by the City of London Central bank controllers. This entity is the Old Black Nobility (OBN), which prefers to stay in the background.</p>
<p><strong>The IZCS controls Private Central Fiat, Fractional Reserve Banking:</strong> This reality that the IZCS owns and controls private Central Banking means that they have access to and can utilize Babylonian Money-Magick to make the money they need to control the USG officials and Congress from nothing.  This access provides vast sums of money in seemingly endless quantities.  Thus, they have access to all the cash they need to buy, own, compromise or blackmail almost every single Congressman/woman and Senator in America.</p>
<p>The serious down-side of this system of Babylonian Money-Magick is that it is based on fiat or fake-money with nothing but debt behind it. Actually this debt is imaginary, but has a stranglehold on most of the members of the societies it has hijacked. But it cannot go on without catastrophic readjustments, which will occur at some point.</p>
<blockquote><p>A worldwide Web of Debt: The private Central Banksters in America have been so adept and successful at extracting wealth in America and all over the world, replacing it with debt, that nearly the whole world is now engulfed in extreme debt.</p>
<p>And this debt has now reached the point it cannot be paid off. This of course is the IZCS’s age-old plan which will result in massive chaos that engulfs the world and destroys all social systems, family systems, sex roles, and systems of government.</p>
<p>After this destruction of conventional society occurs, it is expected by the IZCS top leadership that a pure Luciferian NWO System will arise from the globalist framework they have put in place.  They expect this NWO System emerging from the ashes to be their Phoenix, like the legendary Phoenix of Greek and Roman mythology.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>All this tidal wave of debt is phony and a big charade. </strong> If all the people of the world unite, nationalize their monetary systems and declare all debt null and void, and if they assign all such debt directly to Central Banksters responsible for creating it, prosperity to “we the people” can return like it did to the Colonists who left England.</p>
<p><strong>Babylonian Money-Magick has been used to create a debt based economy.</strong>  It does this by producing “onerous usury” and allows the easy transformation of “all the money created from nothing which is worth nothing at face value” into the vast amounts of ever-increasing wealth.  This wealth–fiat money–is covertly stripped from the common man these Banksters provide the money for and use as a means to extract real value and wealth from.</p>
<p>The Zionist IZCS vehicle used to gain control over almost every single member of Congress and to buy, compromise and control almost every top USG official and Judge, is the 70,000+ K Street Lobbyists, AIPAC and others who distribute the money to their marks, often through campaign contributions, cash to offshore accounts, and various other expensive luxury perks, such as ridiculously high honorariums for meaningless propaganda speeches.</p>
<p><strong>And AIPAC, the ADL, the SPLC and the like are also zionist tools of espionage against America the Republic.</strong></p>
<p>They should all be investigated by the FBI and fully prosecuted and convicted and sentenced for espionage by the Department of Justice. Note, espionage in many cases is a Capital Crime.</p>
<p>If the Rosenbergs were prosecuted, convicted and executed for their espionage against America, why should these IZCS Cutouts go free without identification and full prosecution?</p>
<p>These entities are really Intel fronts for espionage against America the Republic on behalf of the IZCS which includes the City of London zionist Central banksters, Israel, American NeoCons, and Israeli-American dual citizens who have betrayed America, putting Israel first over America.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/maddogisrael-220x320.jpg" width="220" height="320" />Vast Funding for zionist Cutouts.</strong> These entities receive vast funding from the zionist Central Banksters and from the wealthy Judaic businessmen they shake-down or manipulate for large donations by playing on their paranoid tribal delusions.</p>
<p>These tribal delusions are that donations are necessary to prevent excessive antisemitism and future persecutions or “holocausts” by Goyims and Christians.</p>
<p>Many Judaics in America and elsewhere have been en-cultured with the false ideation that Nazi-ism was a Christian phenomena and Christians and Goyim must be destroyed.</p>
<p>This of course this is as far from the truth as possible because Hitler was a British Agent and Nazi-ism was created by the Tavistock Institute and the City of London Central Banksters and a counter-force to the Bolshevism they created and deployed in Russia in 1917.</p>
<blockquote><p>What does the International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS) run out of the City of London through its main Cutouts Israel and the hijacked USG attain? Obviously the IZCS’s unlimited funds and the fact it owns and/or controls almost every member of Congress and most USG officials and Judges, means that the ICS has been able to determine USG Policy.</p>
<p>It can do this because it owns and/or controls all USG top Policy-Makers, most of whom just happen to be outside of the visible USG and within the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously the crimes of the IZCS and their espionage fronts like AIPAC, the ADL, SPLC and the like against the American Republic are far worse than the Rosenbergs.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Listed below are some of the IZCS crimes against America:</strong></p>
<p>1. The NSA and all American Intel has been completely hijacked by the IZCS and all NSA intel data goes directly to Israeli Defense Contractors and Israeli communication Corporations that process all American phone calls and data transmissions. This means that the Five Eyes International Intel System is really a Six Eyes System controlled by Israeli Intel entities and proprietaries.</p>
<p>Thus, America has no real Intel, and Israeli Intel has control over all American politicians, judges and officials by use of this Intel for human compromise, blackmail and sophisticated mind-kontrol operations. Any time factions within American Intel agencies (there are 37 and growing) form opposition to the IZCS, this is readily discovered through Israeli Intel intercepts of NSA raw Intel and actions to neutralize such efforts are quickly deployed–whatever is required.</p>
<p>The conclusion here is that America no longer has any real Intel of its own–none at all–it is all compromised and hijacked by Israeli and City of London Cutouts and contractors.</p>
<p>2. Because the IZCS has hijacked all American Intel directly from NSA feeds, the IZCS has a long history of stealing American intellectual property and providing it to their corporations. The IZCS can also hijack American corporate bids and defeat them repeatedly until many companies go out of business.</p>
<p>3. The IZCS has compromised almost every single member of Congress, US Supreme Court Judges, most Federal, and almost every single USG official and American Intel Director.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TSA-Groping-Glove.jpg" width="260" height="280" />4. The IZCS’s new DHS is a zionist terrorist front, a new Internal American Army that has been deployed against YOU as their NEW ENEMY. The IZCS has created and deployed DHS as the New American Stasi and a New American Neo-Bolshevik Red Cheka. It is controlled by an Israeli-American dual citizen who made millions of USD from selling unshielded X-ray machines to the TSA, which is creating numerous cancer clusters among TSA officers.</p>
<p>5. The principal goal of the IZCS in America is to deploy DHS to tyrannize and degrade Americans and then eventually to start a live “shoot to kill” war against ordinary Americans who organize to take their government back and restore the American Constitutional Republic. This tyranny by DHS is planned to culminate in serial mass-murder of up to 80% of Americans–one way or another.</p>
<p>6. The IZCS has set up and deployed AIPAC, the ADL, the SPLC and others to serve as agents of espionage inside America, to work to destroy its institution of government, dirty up Americans and to destroy the American Family, America’s language borders and culture and to destroy Christianity and Deism in general.</p>
<p>7. The IZCS has hijacked top factions in the CIA, DEA and other American Intel and uses them to traffick illegal narcotics and drugs into America to raise money for deep-cover covert ops.</p>
<p>8. The IZCS has compromised almost every major Urban and Suburban police Department, coercing them to sign secret transfer of jurisdiction agreements giving the Feds, DHS and the Fusion Centers complete jurisdiction in any matter they choose.  In return, they are bribed with “stolen” war materials, machine guns, rounds, armored cars and, even in some cases, grenade launchers.</p>
<p>9. The IZCS has stolen numerous loads of nuclear materials from US DOD contractors and refiners for their Dimona Plant and nuclear storage center.</p>
<p>10. The IZCS has used NSA-provided intel to murder hundreds of witnesses to their crimes and federal Whistleblowers. The rest that they don’t murder are watched and often become victims of targeted harassments, placed on DHS and Fusion Center “Terror Watch Lists”, “No-Fly” Lists and “No work lists”. Take the example of Ronald Reagan’s Secret Agent, the Great American Hero Lee Wanta who was instrumental in “bringing down” the Soviet Union. Lee Wanta has been wrongfully imprisoned, tortured, and endures ongoing harassment.</p>
<p>Or consider Mark Novitsky, another Great American Hero who refused to do wrong and coverup crimes while working for an NSA contractor. Both of these American Heroes have paid a terrible price for obeying the law and for putting the welfare of the American People first.</p>
<p>11. The IZCS has hijacked the America Monetary Production and Distribution System and transformed Americans into debt-slaves, drastically reduced the Middle Class and the standard of living, and done this by massive asset-stripping of American wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>12. The IZCS has used its Cutouts to debase American culture, take the God of our Founding Fathers out of the schools and institutions where they had certain Bible verses and phrases etched in stone, destroy traditional male and female sex roles, destroy the family, promote sexual perversion, promote promiscuity and sexual irresponsibility and addiction, promote diversity and political correctness and illegal immigration and multi-culturalism.</p>
<p>13. The IZCS has completely compromised all of the Major Mass media, transforming it into a propaganda dispenser for the USG and the Central Banksters which are completely under their control. Thus the Major media is now the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM).</p>
<p>14. The IZCS has hijacked American seed companies and most major food processors and is in the process of deploying sophisticated GMO’s which will, over time, radically increase the death rate of Americans.</p>
<p>15. The IZCS has hijacked Big Pharma and Big medicine and has used it to deploy vaccines containing monkey viruses like SV40 and numerous harmful adjuvants like squalene and aluminum or formaldehyde, as well as so-called preservatives like ethyl mercury.</p>
<p>16. The IZCS has hijacked many large Insurance Companies and used them for its own designated purposes.</p>
<p>17. The IZCS has deployed contract aircraft through their hijacked intel groups like the CIA that are spraying toxic weather and eugenic substances in the atmosphere. They have also been able to covertly add these toxic substances to ordinary jet fuel.</p>
<p>Numerous samples of these substances have been collected by researchers and scientists who have had them analyzed.  What they found were toxic levels of nano-particulized aluminum, barium slats, Hemophilus Influenza, red blood cells, white blood cells, toxic molds, and other strange fiber like substances and compounds.</p>
<p>18. The IZCS has used its vast criminal networks and resources to launder its drug money by buying up large real estate entities and banks and is able to finance almost every new major corporate building with laundered drug money.</p>
<p>19. The IZCS has used a great deal of its money from illegal drug trafficking to build deep underground military bases (DUMBS). Some of these bases are claimed by top insiders to be joint ventures with alien entities and have special genetic labs involved in the development of alien ET/human hybrids.</p>
<p>20. The IZCS is the world’s top Mind-kontroller.  It has used hijacked American Intel and its defense contractors to develop and deploy advanced high technology for psychotronic, direct brain entrainment and sound-based subliminal mind-kontrol.</p>
<p>21. Israel used advanced mind-kontrol on those who accept its all-paid junkets. Visitors end up drinking their special Kool-aide and are hit with sophisticated psychotronics, becoming significantly mind-kontrolled to operate as functional zionists without even being aware of it.</p>
<p>22. The IZCS has created what they call the federal family. They have done this by creating Fusion Centers, the DHS, the TSA and numerous armed (previously unarmed) agencies like the Department of Education. Unduly large salaries and extremely liberal benefits have been provided, as well as a special anointing with authoritarian powers to kill with very little accountability if any, due to the War on Terror.</p>
<p>Many of these federal Family folks have been mind-kontrolled by shoulder-held constant on pulsed beam microwave radios and other highly advanced psychotronics, which increases their tendencies to tyrannize and become violent with the public and minimizes their ability to control violent impulses which may crop up.</p>
<p>23. The IZCS has militarized local police departments and many Sheriff’s departments. Their ADL provides most of the police training and drives a hard line against any public dissent, describing it as “domestic terrorism”. It controls what the Fusion Centers and DHS put out as war propaganda which labels the public as “Domestic Terrorists”.</p>
<p>Here is the first part of one of their confidential lists of Domestic Terrorists or Suspected Domestic Terrorists:  Catholics, Evangelical Christians, Veterans, Libertarians, Constitutionalists, Tax protestors, Gun owners…..These reports of course are pure ADL propaganda lies and complete smear jobs, all intended to provoke police and Federal Family officers to tyrannize and easily become violent with innocent ordinary Americans or anyone who decides to peacefully protest, an American Constitutional Right.</p>
<p>Remember that the operational goal of the top Policy-Makers who are tools of the IZCS is to provoke a full scale shooting war between ordinary Americans and their police and Federal family Members such as DHS.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  The IZCS has hijacked America and has deployed numerous weapons against it now culminating in a phony, staged War on Terror, and if you are an American or live in America, one way or another YOU will soon become THEIR NEW ENEMY. Yes, from here on out if you live in America, you are the designated enemy in this new War On Terror.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the federal family, it is suggested that you read and study up on the Night of the Longknives (Operation Hummingbird) and the various purges under Lenin, Stalin and Mao. Maybe you should reconsider the oath you took to UPHOLD the US Constitution from ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN and DOMESTIC.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now for some good news about all this.  Despite how bleak this all seems it is far from hopeless and American are beginning to wake up in mass. This is due to the worldwide Internet and the massive dissemination and diffusion of the alternative news.  Once facts are published they sink into the hearts of “we the people” with a certain resonance that makes them take hold.</p>
<p>It’s almost instinctive how truth sticks like glue in people hearts and minds and spreads like wildfire all around the Earth. At least 1% of the American population has woken up. Some estimates are 11%. Proof of this is the massive first time gun buyers, the massive sales of high powered handguns, rifles and 12 gauge shotguns and massive ammo sales.</p>
<p>Guns and ammo have literally been flying off the shelves the last several years and there have been serious ammo shortages due to the massive DHS and USG stockpiling of 40 Caliber Hollow Pints and M-16 ammo rounds.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/070213dhs.jpg" width="245" height="210" />Once 12% of the population wakes up a critical mass turning point will spontaneously occur and through various very strange mass societal changes will occurs and new very powerful, unstoppable populism will emerge and the IZCS will be driven out.</p>
<p>If they are stupid enough to take us into a live shooting war, Internal Civil War with mass killing, the public will suffer great losses but the Federal Family will split and it and the IZCS and any of their forces will be defeated.</p>
<p>All wars are always won by what is in the hearts and minds.  In America the American Spirit lives and is getting stronger every day. Soon the foreign filth and their Cutouts run by the Kingpins from City of London and Israel, the perps that have hijacked America, the IZCS, will be completely exposed, stopped, or routed out, one way or another.</p>
<p>And there is good evidence that many retired Intel Cowboys have gone back to work to bring the IZCS Beast down and destroy its grip on American Intel and private Central Banking. Some of the covert operators have long records of success and can create and use numerous different identities.</p>
<p>Many of these Intel Cowboys can use make up and make their own credentials to impersonate officers, draw military and USG paychecks from multiple sources, all at the same time and hack into any computer system anywhere in the USG or American Intel, anywhere anytime. Most of them just did not realize that the IZCS has taken control because of unlimited money provided by zionist Central Banksters and Judaic supporters.</p>
<p>And the best news of all is that more than a few seasoned Intel Cowboys that served the Bush Cabal at its center as well as the IZCS, have now woken up, pulled away from the Bush cabal and are targeting the IZCS with deep cover covert ops that would make your hair stand on end if you were allowed to know.</p>
<p>Some of these Intel Cowboys have now admitted that they were kept so narrowly compartmented that they did not realize the whole picture until the Internet and the numerous Federal Whistle-blowers coming forward and spilling the beans. the simple fact is this, the worldwide Internet and the alternative news it provides spreads truth like a wildfire that cannot be put out even with the application of military force.</p>
<p>The Internet is the New Gutenberg Press, the Achilles Heel of the IZCS.  The Internet will turn out to be the greatest trick in history played on the IZCS by the young men at Drapa.  They sold the Internet to the IZCS and its SSG promising the greatest spying and surveillance system imaginable.  Yes the IZCS got much of what was promised but also a very big hidden surprise which assures their complete exposure and destruction, piece by piece. And this disassembling of the IZCS is already well under way.</p>
<p>The IZCS is now in its death throes and is like a rabid, cornered dog.  That makes it very dangerous for the next year or two until it is completely defanged which is coming. If they use the Samson option which they have been threatening numerous nation-states with (they already used it on japan with the nukes planted in the sea bed and in the security camera on site because Japanese turned against them).</p>
<p>New factions within the Military High Command and the USN have already taken note and are working carefully in the background to defang Dimona by utilizing secret satellite activated back-doors in various hardware circuits.</p>
<p>During the height of the bush Cabal (Bush1) those Intel Cowboys that did know were arrested and jailed on trumped up charges to discredit any possible testimony before Congress or in the courts. Now that many have been informed of what really happened on 9-11-01, they are hopping mad that America has been hijacked and the Constitution and its Bill of Rights, and the Rule of Law has been suppressed and ignored by this world’s largest criminal cabal.</p>
<p>The IZCS attacks on America on 9-11-01 have proved to have been a “going for broke” attempt to build a expanded Israeli in greatest intended form. We now know that it was the greatest and final reckless mistake of Israel so far. Even far worse than Israel’s False-Flag attack on the USS Liberty in their attempt to draw America into a Mideast War at the time which even President Johnson, their crypto Judaic stooge refused.</p>
<p>And now many Americans have finally been informed that the Murrah Building attack as well as the first NYC Twin Towers attack using a 55 drum of cyanide stolen from Louis Champon’s Natural Cherrie Flavoring Plant in Boca Raton, Florida, financed by Dr. Ishan Barbouti, the IZCS Cutout that has died at least three times and always come back to life.</p>
<p>As few know, only the top NeoCons 911 Planners, Dr. Barbouti rose again and came back to life to assist with many of the 9/11 attacks subplots which were designed to provide numerous false leads. A few of the most Patriotic Intel Cowboys who have “traveled” very close to the very “top of the pyramid” now believe that Israel provided the anti-matter positron micro-nukes which were installed in the Twin Towers elevators approximately every ten floors.</p>
<p>Most retired Intel Cowboys had previously thought Israel was a supportive Intel partner but didn’t realize that Israel murdered 135 Americans on the Liberty ship as a False-Flag attack and also murdered another 3,000 humans being in NYC and at the Pentagon on 911, assisted by Traitors within the USAF, NORAD and the JCS.</p>
<p>Now that these Intel Cowboys know the truth, they have woken up and back at work serving America’s true “National Security”. I don’t know exactly what they will do but I would expect some very, very crafty covert moves to expose, drive the IZCS out of America or demo it irreparably if necessary.</p>

<p>An editorial in the Financial Times last week, entitled “End drift to war in the East China Sea,” highlighted the growing alarm in ruling circles about the prospect of a conflict between Japan and China. “The possibility of war,” it declared, “is rapidly emerging as one of the biggest security risks facing the world,” and the two governments “are doing nothing to make conflict less likely.”</p>
<p>The FT focussed on comments by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he explicitly drew the comparison between the current rivalry in East Asia and that between Britain and Germany prior to World War I. “For Japan’s prime minister to allow any comparison with 1914 in Europe is chilling and inflammatory,” it stated.</p>
<p>The immediate source of tensions is the territorial dispute over rocky outcrops in the East China Sea, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. However, the chief responsibility for inflaming this dangerous flashpoint, along with others throughout the region, lies with the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia”—a strategy aimed at isolating China economically and diplomatically, and encircling it militarily.</p>
<p>While hypocritically claiming to be “neutral” on the territorial dispute, Washington has repeatedly declared that, in the event of a war over the islands, the US would support its ally Japan. Moreover, as part of the “pivot,” the Obama administration has been restructuring its military bases in Japan and encouraging Japan to remilitarise.</p>
<p>Asia in 2014 does bear a chilling resemblance to Europe in 1914. World War I arose over the intractable competition for spheres of influence between the major powers. As Lenin and Trotsky, the great Marxists of that period explained, it marked the opening of the imperialist epoch—the epoch of the death agony of capitalism.</p>
<p>The global financial crisis that erupted in 2008, the worsening world economic slump and rising geo-political tensions make clear that capitalism has resolved none of the fundamental contradictions that produced the horrors of a century ago.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, US imperialism has plunged into one war of aggression after another—Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya—as well as numerous intrigues and provocations, in a desperate bid to offset its relative economic decline through its military predominance. The installation of Obama as president and his “pivot” to Asia reflected deep concerns in the American establishment that the Bush administration’s focus on the Middle East undermined US hegemony in Asia, including over its cheap labour platforms, above all China, that had become central to corporate profit.</p>
<p>Under Obama, the US has encouraged allies such as Japan and the Philippines to take a more assertive stance in their disputes with China; begun to “rebalance” 60 percent of US air and naval forces to the Indo-Pacific; and is establishing new basing arrangements with Australia and other Asia-Pacific countries as part of its war preparations.</p>
<p>In Japan, the US “pivot” has helped foster the emergence of the right-wing Abe government that, in the space of a year, has increased military spending for the first time in a decade and moved to end constitutional restrictions on the Japanese armed forces. Last month, Abe provocatively visited the notorious Yasukuni Shrine to the country’s war dead—a potent symbol of Japanese militarism in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
<p>Abe is being driven by the interests of Japanese imperialism, which is not prepared to relinquish its position as a leading power in Asia. In his speech at Davos, Abe dismissed pundits who “called Japan the land of the setting sun” and declared that “a new dawn” was breaking. The two themes of his speech were equally aggressive—thinly-disguised criticisms of China, alongside cut-throat economic measures designed to undermine rivals and turn Japan into one of the “most business-friendly places in the world.”</p>
<p>By likening China to Germany in 1914, Abe is seeking to portray Beijing as a dangerous new menace. Unlike Germany, however, China is not an imperialist power. Despite the size of its economy, it continues to function as a cheap labour platform, completely dependent on foreign corporate investment and technology, as well as the existing centres of finance capital. In the military sphere, the US has an overwhelming preponderance, and a global network of bases and alliances that can threaten Chinese interests anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Backed into a corner by the US over the past four years, the Chinese leadership has responded by offering further economic concessions to the major powers, on the one hand, while boosting military spending and asserting its claims in waters immediately adjacent to the Chinese mainland, on the other. The Beijing regime is whipping up anti-Japanese chauvinism both to justify its military build-up and to divert attention from the extreme social tensions produced by three decades of capitalist restoration.</p>
<p>While drawing attention to the rising danger of war, the Financial Times editorial offered no solution, other than an impotent appeal for “both sides to stop rattling sabres and start talking to one another.” Ignoring the fact that the US “pivot” has stoked the present confrontation, the editorial appealed for Washington to intervene as the voice of peace and reason. Both Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping “should look for a route away from Armageddon before it is too late,” it concluded.</p>
<p>However, as in 1914, the drive to war is being fuelled by the inherent contradictions of capitalism—between global economy and the outmoded nation state system, and private ownership of the means of production and socialised production—that have erupted with full force in the wake of the 2008 global breakdown. The only means of averting the catastrophe being prepared for humanity is the abolition of the bankrupt profit system and the socialist reorganisation of society to meet the social needs of vast majority, not the super-profits of a tiny wealthy elite. The dangers of another world war underscore the necessity of rejecting all forms of nationalism and patriotism and building a unified international anti-war movement of workers and youth in China, Japan, the US and around the world to carry out this urgent task.</p>

			<p>A <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality...ith-polly-curtis/2012/jan/24/phone-hacking">poll</a> last year showed that trust in the mainstream media is increasing, which should worry all of us who value truth, integrity and press freedom. Why? Here are 10 disturbing things everyone needs to know about the global media giants who control our supply of information, wielding immense power over the people- and even over the government.</p>
<p><strong>1. Mainstream media exists solely to make profit</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Image Credit:  ♥ photofairy" src="http://cdn2.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Rupert-Murdoch-300x171.jpg" width="300" height="171" /><br />
What´s the purpose of the mainstream media? Saying that the press exists to inform, educate or entertain is like saying Apple corporation´s primary function is to make technology which will enrich our lives. Actually, the mass media industry is the same as any other in a capitalist society: it exists to make profit. <em>Medialens</em>, a British campaigning site which critiques mainstream (or corporate) journalism, <a href="http://www.medialens.org/index.php/alerts/alert-archive/alerts-2013/719-jousting-with-toothpicks-the-case-for-challenging-corporate-journalism.html" target="_blank">quoted</a>business journalist Marjorie Kelly as saying that all corporations, including those dealing with media, exist only to maximize returns to their shareholders. This is, she said,  ´the law of the land…universally accepted as a kind of divine, unchallengeable truth´. Without pleasing shareholders and a board of directors, mass media enterprises simply would not exist. And once you understand this, you´ll never watch the news in the same way again.</p>
<p><strong>2. Advertisers dictate content</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Flicr / WilliamBanzai7/Colonel Flick " src="http://cdn.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-10-at-8.50.05-PM-300x200.png" width="270" height="180" />So how does the pursuit of profit affect the news we consume? Media corporations make the vast majority (typically around 75%) of their profit from advertising, meaning it´s advertisers themselves that dictate content- <em>not</em> journalists, and certainly not consumers. Imagine you are editor of a successful newspaper or TV channel with high circulation or viewing figures. You attract revenue from big brands and multinational corporations such as BP, Monsanto and UAE airlines. How could you then tackle important topics such as climate change, GM food or disastrous oil spills in a way that is both honest to your audience and favorable to your clients? The simple answer is you can´t. This might explain why Andrew Ross Sorkin of the <em>New York Times-</em>  <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/andrew-ross-sorkin-gives-goldman-a-rubdown-20110607" target="_blank">sponsored</a> by Goldman Sachs-  is so keen to<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/the-fine-print-of-goldmans-subprime-bet/" target="_blank">defend</a> the crooked corporation.<strong> </strong>Andrew Marr, a political correspondent for the <em></em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" target="_blank">BBC</a>, sums up the dilemma in his <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/140500536X/guardianunlim-21" target="_blank">autobiography</a>: ´The biggest question is whether advertising limits and reshapes the news agenda. It does, of course. It’s hard to make the sums add up when you are kicking the people who write the cheques.´ Enough said…</p>
<p><strong>3. Billionaire tycoons &amp; media monopolies threaten real journalism<br />
</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Image Credit - Flickr / Mike Licht" src="http://cdn2.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/5970160126_6ea6f1818d-300x201.jpg" width="300" height="201" /><br />
The monopolization of the press (fewer individuals or organizations controlling increasing shares of the mass media) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership" target="_blank">growing</a>year by year, and this is a grave danger to press ethics and diversity. Media mogul Rupert<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch" target="_blank">Murdoch</a>´s  neo-liberal personal <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/K._Rupert_Murdoch#Politics" target="_blank">politics</a> are reflected in his 175 newspapers and endorsed by pundits (see Fox news) on the 123 TV channels he owns in the USA alone. Anyone who isn´t worried by this one man´s view of the world being consumed by millions of people across the globe- from the USA to the UK, New Zealand to Asia, Europe to Australia- isn´t thinking hard enough about the consequences. It´s a grotesquely all-encompassing monopoly, leaving no doubt that Murdoch is one of the most powerful men in the world. But as the News International phone hacking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal" target="_blank">scandal</a>  showed, he´s certainly not the most honorable or ethical. Neither is Alexander<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebedev" target="_blank">Lebedev</a>, a former KGB spy and politician who bought British newspaper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent" target="_blank"><em>The Independent</em></a>  in 2010.  With Lebedev´s fingers in so many pies (the billionaire oligarch is into everything from investment banking to airlines), can we really expect news coverage from this once well-respected publication to continue in the same vein? Obviously not: the paper had always carried a banner on its front page declaring itself  ´free from party political bias, free from proprietorial influence´, but interestingly this was dropped in September 2011.</p>
<p><strong>4. Corporate press is in bed with the government</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Photo: Dafydd Jones (telegraph.co.uk)" src="http://cdn4.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brooks-cameron_2214683b-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" /><br />
Aside from the obvious, one of the most disturbing facts to emerge from Murdoch´s News International phone hacking scandal (background information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal" target="_blank">here</a> ) was the exposure of shady <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2150875/Cameron-blown-away-Murdoch-links-says-David-Mellor-Cleggs-cosy-ties-moguls-fixer-emerge.html" target="_blank">connections</a>  between top government officials and press tycoons. During the scandal, and throughout the subsequent Leveson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveson_inquiry" target="_blank">inquiry</a> into British press ethics (or lack of them), we learned of secret<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2135379/Revealed-David-Camerons-secret-meetings-Rupert-Murdoch-didnt-disclose.html" target="_blank"> meetings</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/12/rupert-murdoch-john-major" target="_blank">threats</a>by Murdoch to politicians who didn´t do as he wanted, and that Prime Minister David Cameron has a <em>very</em> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227459/Camerons-horseplay-texts-Rebekah-Brooks-Intimate-messages-PM-reveal-likes-fast-unpredicatable-ride.html" target="_blank">close</a> friendship with The Sun´s then editor-in-chief (and CEO of News International) Rebekah <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekah_Brooks" target="_blank">Brooks</a>. How can journalists do their job of holding politicians to account when they are vacationing together or rubbing shoulders at private dinner parties? Clearly, they don´t intend to. But the support works both ways- Cameron´s government tried to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9223220/James-Murdoch-discussed-BSkyB-bid-with-David-Cameron-over-dinner.html" target="_blank">help</a> Murdoch´s son win a bid for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSkyB" target="_blank">BSkyB</a>, while bizarrely,  warmongering ex Prime Minister Tony Blair is godfather to Murdoch´s daughter Grace. As well as ensuring an overwhelming bias in news coverage and election campaigns, flooding newspapers with cheap and easy articles from unquestioned government sources, and gagging writers from criticizing those in power, these secret connections also account for much of the corporate media´s incessant peddling of the patriotism <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/25/no_thanks_i_wont_support_the_troops/" target="_blank">lie</a>-  especially in the lead-up to attacks on other countries. Here´s an interesting<a href="http://www.alternet.org/media/manipulated-power-what-wrong-new-york-times?akid=10893.1087451.f1tsm7&amp;rd=1&amp;src=newsletter892873&amp;t=13" target="_blank">analysis</a> of <em>The New York Times</em>´s coverage of the current Syria situation for example, demonstrating how corporate journalists are failing to reflect public feeling on the issue of a full-scale attack on Assad by the US and its allies. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Important stories are overshadowed by trivia</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Image Credit: heavy.com" src="http://cdn.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/snowden-russia-waldo-one-300x300.jpg" width="168" height="168" /><br />
You could be forgiven for assuming that the most interesting part of Edward Snowden´s status as a whistleblower was his plane ride from Hong Kong to Russia, or his lengthy stint waiting in Moscow airport for someone- <em>anyone</em>- to offer him asylum. Because with the exception of <em>The Guardian</em> who published the leaks (read them in full<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files" target="_blank">here</a>), the media has generally preferred not to focus on Snowden´s damning revelations about freedom and tyranny, but rather on banal<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22837100" target="_blank">trivia</a> – his personality and background, whether his girlfriend misses him, whether he is actually a Chinese spy, and ahhh, didn´t he remind us all of <em>Where´s Waldo</em> as he flitted across the globe as a wanted fugitive? The same could be said of Bradley Manning´s gender re-assignment, which conveniently <a href="http://www.trueactivist.com/the-chelsea-manning-bombshell-be-careful-what-you-fall-for/" target="_blank">overshadowed</a> the enormous injustice of his sentence. And what of Julian Assange? His <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11047811" target="_blank">profile</a> on the globally-respected BBC<strong></strong> is dedicated almost entirely to a subtle smearing of character, rather than detailing <em>Wikileaks</em>´s profound impact on our view of the world. In every case, the principal stories are forgotten as our attention, lost in a sea of trivia, is expertly diverted from the real issues at hand: those which invariably, the government wants us to forget.</p>
<p><strong>6. Mainstream media doesn´t ask questions</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Image Credit / web.archive.org" src="http://cdn3.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/web.archive.org_-300x253.png" width="300" height="253" /><br />
´Check your sources, check your facts´ are golden rules in journalism 101, but you wouldn´t guess that from reading the mainstream press or watching corporate TV channels. At the time of writing, Obama is beating the war drums over Syria. Following accusations by the US and Britain that Assad was responsible for a nerve gas attack on his own civilians last month, most mainstream newspapers- like the afore-mentioned <em>New York Times</em>- have<a href="http://www.alternet.org/media/manipulated-power-what-wrong-new-york-times?akid=10893.1087451.f1tsm7&amp;rd=1&amp;src=newsletter892873&amp;t=13" target="_blank"> failed</a> to demand evidence or call for restraint on a full-scale attack. But there are several good reasons why journalists should question the official story. Firstly, British right-wing newspaper <em>The Daily Mail</em> actually ran a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130129213824/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2270219/U-S-planned-launch-chemical-weapon-attack-Syria-blame-Assad.html" target="_blank">news</a> piece back in January this year, publishing leaked emails from a British arms company showing the US was planning a false flag chemical attack on Syria´s civilians. They would then blame it on Assad to gain public support for a subsequent full-scale invasion. The article was hastily deleted but a cached version still <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130129213824/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2270219/U-S-planned-launch-chemical-weapon-attack-Syria-blame-Assad" target="_blank">exists</a>. Other recent evidence lends support to the unthinkable. It has emerged that the chemicals used to make the nerve gas were indeed <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10279790/Government-allowed-export-of-nerve-gas-chemicals-to-Syria.html" target="_blank">shipped</a> from Britain, and German intelligence<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/08/syria-chemical-weapons-not-assad-bild" target="_blank">insists</a> Assad was not responsible for the chemical attack. Meanwhile, a hacktivist has come forward with alleged evidence of US intelligence agencies´ involvement in the massacre (download it for yourself <a href="http://pastebin.com/zeXpsRnh" target="_blank">here</a> ), with a <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/did-the-white-house-help-plan-the-syrian-chemical-attack/5347542" target="_blank">growing</a> body of evidence suggesting this vile plot was hatched by Western powers. Never overlook the corporate media´s ties to big business and big government before accepting what you are told- because if journalism is dead, you have a right and a duty to ask your own questions.</p>
<p><strong>7. Corporate journalists hate real journalists</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Image Credit / intellectualrevolution.tv" src="http://cdn4.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/war-on-whistleblowers-intellectual-revolution-300x231.png" width="300" height="231" /><br />
Sirota rightly points out the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/20/grunwald_vs_greenwald_whos_the_activist_journalist_now/?source=newsletter" target="_blank">irony</a> of this: ´Here we have a reporter expressing excitement at the prospect of the government executing the publisher of information that became the basis for some of the most important journalism in the last decade.´ Sirota goes on to note various examples of what he calls the ´Journalists against Journalism <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/07/02/meet_the_journalists_against_journalism_club/" target="_blank">club</a>´, and gives several<a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/20/grunwald_vs_greenwald_whos_the_activist_journalist_now/?source=newsletter" target="_blank">examples</a> of how <em>The Guardian</em> columnist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Greenwald" target="_blank">Glenn Greenwald</a> has been attacked by the corporate press for publishing Snowden´s leaks. <em>The New York Time</em>s’ Andrew Ross Sorkin called for Greenwald’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_tGfP8c85s" target="_blank">arrest</a>, while <em>NBC’</em>s David Gregory´s <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/greenwald-tears-into-david-gregory-with-newsmen-like-you-who-needs-government-to-criminalize-reporting/" target="_blank">declared</a> that Greenwald has ´aided and abetted Snowden´. As for the question of whether journalists can indeed be outspoken, Sirota accurately notes that it all depends on whether their opinions serve or challenge the status quo, and goes on to <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/20/grunwald_vs_greenwald_whos_the_activist_journalist_now/?source=newsletter" target="_blank">list</a> the hypocrisy of Greenwald´s critics in depth: ´Grunwald has saber-rattling opinions that proudly support the government’s drone strikes and surveillance. Sorkin’s opinions promote Wall Street’s interests. (<em>The Washington Post</em>´s David) Broder had opinions that supported, among other things, the government’s corporate-serving “free” trade agenda. (<em>The Washington Post</em>´s Bob) Woodward has opinions backing an ever-bigger Pentagon budget that enriches defense contractors. (<em>The Atlantic</em>´s Jeffrey) Goldberg promotes the Military-Industrial Complex’s generally pro-war opinions. (<em>The New York Times</em>´s Thomas) Friedman is all of them combined, promoting both “free” trade and “suck on this” militarism. Because these voices loyally promote the unstated assumptions that serve the power structure and that dominate American politics, all of their particular opinions aren’t even typically portrayed as opinions; they are usually portrayed as noncontroversial objectivity.´</p>
<p><strong>8. Bad news sells, good news is censored, and celebrity gossip trumps important issues</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Justin Bieber - Image Credit / Wikimedia" src="http://cdn4.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/444px-Believe_Tour_7_2012-222x300.jpg" width="222" height="300" /><br />
It´s sad but true: bad news really does sell more newspapers. But why? Are we really so pessimistic? Do we relish the suffering of others? Are we secretly glad that something terrible happened to someone else, not us? Reading the corporate press as an alien visiting Earth you might assume so. Generally, news coverage is sensationalist and depressing as hell, with so many pages dedicated to murder, rape and pedophilia and yet none to the billions of good deeds and amazingly inspirational movements taking place every minute of every day all over the planet. But the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/sep/04/thegoodnewsaboutbadnewsi" target="_blank">reasons</a> we consume bad news are perfectly logical. In times of harmony and peace, people simply don´t feel the need to educate themselves as much as they do in times of crises. That´s good news for anyone beginning to despair that humans are apathetic, hateful and dumb, and it could even be argued that this sobering and simple fact is a great incentive for the mass media industry to do something worthwhile. They could start offering the positive and hopeful angle for a change. They could use dark periods of increased public interest to convey a message of peace and justice. They could reflect humanity´s desire for solutions and our urgent concerns for the environment. They could act as the voice of a global population who has had enough of violence and lies to campaign for transparency, equality, freedom, truth, and real democracy. Would that sell newspapers? I think so. They could even hold a few politicians to account on behalf of the people, wouldn´t that be something? But for the foreseeable future, it´s likely the corporate press will just distract our attention with another picture of Rhianna´s butt, another rumor about Justin Bieber´s coke habit, or another article about Kim Kardashian (who is she again?) wearing perspex heels with swollen ankles while pregnant. Who cares about the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/21/global-elite-tax-offshore-economy" target="_blank">missing</a>$21 trillion, what was she <em>thinking</em>?</p>
<p><strong>9. Whoever controls language controls the population</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Flickr / Jason Ilagan" src="http://cdn.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/68811124_784a37b587_z-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /><br />
Have you read George Orwell´s classic novel<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/1984-Nineteen-Eighty-Four-George-Orwell/dp/0140817743" target="_blank">1984</a> yet? It´s become a clichéd reference in today´s dystopia, that´s true, but with good reason. There are many-<em> too</em> many- parallels between Orwell´s dark imaginary future and our current reality, but one important part of his vision concerned language. Orwell coined the word ´<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak" target="_blank">Newspeak</a>´  to describe a simplistic version of the English language with the aim of limiting free thought on issues that would challenge the status quo (creativity, peace, and individualism for example). The concept of Newspeak includes what Orwell called ´DoubleThink´-  how language is made ambiguous or even inverted to convey the opposite of what is true. In his book, the Ministry of War is known as the Ministry of Love, for example, while the Ministry of Truth deals with propaganda and entertainment. Sound familiar yet? Another book that delves into this topic deeper is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0349119244?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=unspeak-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0349119244" target="_blank">Unspeak</a>, a must-read for anyone interested in language and power and specifically how words are distorted for political ends. Terms such as ´peace keeping missiles´, ´extremists´ and ´no-fly zones´, weapons being referred to as ´assets´, or misleading business euphemisms such as ´downsizing´ for redundancy and ´sunset´ for termination- these, and hundreds of other examples, demonstrate how powerful language can be. In a world of growing corporate media monopolization, those who wield this power can manipulate words and therefore public reaction, to encourage compliance, uphold the status quo, or provoke fear.</p>
<p><strong>10. Freedom of the press no longer exists</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Flickr / watchingfrogsboil " src="http://cdn.trueactivist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/6136345929_332286d2a2-300x189.jpg" width="300" height="189" /><br />
The only press that is currently free (at least for now) is the independent publication with no corporate advertisers, board of directors, shareholders or CEOs. Details of how the state has redefined journalism are noted <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/06/28/obamas_war_on_journalism/singleton/" target="_blank">here</a> and are mentioned in #7, but the best recent example would be the government´s treatment of <em>The Guardian</em> over its publication of the Snowden leaks. As a side note, it´s possible this paper plays us as well as any other- The Guardian Media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Media_Group" target="_blank">Group</a> isn´t small fry, after all. But on the other hand- bearing in mind points 1 to 9- why should we find it hard to believe that after the NSA files were published, editor Alan Rusbridge was<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters" target="_blank">told</a> by the powers that be ´you´ve had your fun, now return the files´, that government officials stormed his newsroom and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/21/sending-message-miranda-gchq-nsa" target="_blank">smashed</a> up hard drives, or that Greenwald´s partner David Miranda was<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/18/glenn-greenwald-guardian-partner-detained-heathrow" target="_blank">detained</a> for 9 hours in a London airport under the Terrorism Act as he delivered documents related to the columnist´s story? Journalism, Alan Rusbridge <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/25/cudlipp-lecture-alan-rusbridger" target="_blank">lamented</a>, ´may be facing a kind of existential threat.´ As CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather <a href="http://www.medialens.org/index.php/alerts/alert-archive/alerts-2013/738-advocacy-journalism.html" target="_blank">wrote</a>: ‘We have few princes and earls today, but we surely have their modern-day equivalents in the very wealthy who seek to manage the news, make unsavory facts disappear and elect representatives who are in service to their own economic and social agenda… The “free press” is no longer a check on power. It has instead become part of the power apparatus itself.’</p>

			<p><em>“You’re not supposed to be so blind with patriotism that you cannot face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who does it or says It.”</em> – Malcolm X</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/corporateobama3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>I have been reading political commentary on <a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/">Black Agenda Report</a> (BAR) regularly of late. The site, which purveys a black leftist perspective, regularly excoriates President Obama, as well they should. BAR has become a trusted source in my quest to understand history and current events. This is the home of the real left, not the pseudo left that pervades the corporate airwaves masquerading as champions of equality. Here, no one is paying homage to Obama or calling him a liberal or progressive simply because he is a black democrat. No one is calling him a socialist, either. The political commentators at BAR hold Obama to the same standard to which they held George W. Bush and his fascist predecessors.</p>
<p align="left">Most of the self-proclaimed liberals who castigated Bush and Cheney for their neoconservative polices are giving Obama, whose polices are no less regressive or extreme than those of his precursors, a free ride. This is because the president belongs to the Democratic Party, which continues to be associated with traditional liberalism in the minds of contemporary faux progressives and liberals, rather than the neoliberalism that defines its policies.</p>
<p align="left">Those who continue to support Obama and his backsliding pro-corporate regime obviously have no conception about what classical liberalism and progressivism are. They are at least half a century behind the times.</p>
<p align="left">Although I may lack the political acumen to concisely define terms such as liberalism, progressivism, and leftist, which are somewhat subjective anyway, it is apparent to me that neoliberalism, the form of liberalism that is actually practiced by today’s Democratic Party, bears much in common with the neoconservatism that is associated with contemporary Republicans. There is nothing progressive about either ideology, and nothing in them that is beneficial to workers. To call Obama a liberal or a socialist, as so many people do, is beyond farcical. It strains one’s credulity to the breaking point.</p>
<p align="left">I distrust Barack Obama for the same reasons that I spurn George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, the Clintons, and any other war mongering capitalist. My criticism has nothing to do with race or gender. It stems from ideological differences, class conflict, and radically dissimilar values from the ruling clique.</p>
<p align="left">Among some black folk, charges of racism are leveled against any white folks who criticize the black president in the same way that charges of anti-Semitism are used against anyone who is critical of Israel’s Zionist polices of apartheid that, with the aid of the U.S., are being carried out against the Palestinians. This is not to deny the racism that is directed against the president. It is to philosophically and morally disassociate myself from any and all groups of white supremacists engaged in bigotry.</p>
<p align="left">If a policy is morally reprehensible and unjust, just people have a moral obligation to criticize it, regardless of who is responsible for formulating and enacting such policies. Every socially conscious human being has an ethical responsibility to take action against criminal government or any corporation that is harming one’s community, or for that matter, the planet.</p>
<p align="left">From my perspective, BAR and WPFW’s Jared Ball are ethically consistent and accurate in their critiques of Barack Obama and American capitalism. These venerable warriors are true leftists who do not compromise their principles for political expediency, cost them what it may.</p>
<p align="left">The virtually defunct radical left was once a formidable and organized political force in the U.S. Today’s leftists are treated like pariahs by the pseudo left and its neocon brethren. Radical leftists pose a viable threat to the established orthodoxy. Anyone who refuses to carry forth the performative role assigned to them by the dominant culture is a threat to those in power. As true combatants for justice, today’s leftwing dissidents are worthy of being associated with iconic revolutionaries like Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, and Mumia Abu Jamal, all of whom happen to be black.</p>
<p align="left">By contrast, Barack Obama, who mouths an endless stream of pseudo liberal platitudes, is an unabashed disciple of Milton Friedman and the market fundamentalism he revered. This identifies the president as a corporate fascist and thus a promoter of inequality. It allies him with America’s ruling class. Obama and his supporters should not be identified in any way, shape or form with thereal left. Whatever minutia one uses to differentiate between contemporary neoliberals and neoconservatives is akin to splitting hairs.</p>
<p align="left">The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are not mortal enemies, as portrayed in the corporate media; they are in collusion against the world’s working class and the poor. Together, they are raping and pillaging the Earth Mother and repressing workers through economic violence and imposed austerity. Like costumed wrestlers performing on television, the acrimony is not real; it is vitriolic political theater, an enthralling puppet show for diehard believers.</p>
<p align="left">We must somehow move beyond party politics, beyond the simplicity of liberal versus conservative dichotomy, beyond left against right, and see things as they really are rather than as we wish them to be.</p>
<p align="left">Voting doesn’t change anything in a system flush with corporate money. The structures that put the money into politics cannot be used to extract it. Without proportional representation or corporate money, third parties are not a viable option in state and federal elections. They are just another distraction from reality, a mild form of symbolic protest. Voting for justice does nothing to actually attain it. Direct action directly applied to a problem offers the best hope for revolutionary change.</p>
<p align="left">Conversely, political dualism keeps us fighting the wrong people. It has us believing in people and institutions that do not promote justice and do us harm. These institutions are not what they purport to be. They are at best a mirage; something that appears real but only exists in the mind of the beholder.</p>
<p align="left">Belief in the American Dream and perverted systems of power as a means to justice provides a method for directing and cajoling the masses to do the biding of the super-wealthy and all-powerful corporate state. Faith, hope, and belief in phony people and bogus institutions function as a form of mass hypnosis that keeps the people from organizing in class struggle against a common oppressor—the capitalist system.</p>
<p align="left">Despite reams of contradictory historical evidence, most people in the U.S. continue to associate democracy with capitalism. It is reckless of us to allow anyone to use these terms interchangeably without contesting them at every opportunity. Let me be clear: Democracy is the antithesis of capitalism! But capitalism is the product the U.S. government, the Pentagon, and the commercial media are marketing to us as democracy. And thus the inequality gap, the disparity between rich and poor, is growing wider rather than shrinking.</p>
<p align="left">The nemesis of all working people, regardless of where they live or their political affiliation, is capitalism and its linear, hierarchal, male-dominated power structures. This is why we must have a truthful critique of capitalism and patriarchy and create alternatives that promote the public wellbeing above corporate profits. Many promising alternatives, such as Professor Richard Wolff’s Worker Self-Directed Enterprise (<a href="http://www.democracyatwork.info/">http://www.democracyatwork.info</a>), already exist.</p>
<p align="left">When the richest and most powerful people on earth, the primary beneficiaries of capitalism, invest so many resources into demonizing and subverting the writings of one man—Karl Marx—and the various economic and philosophic alternatives to capitalism, inquisitive minds want to know why. There are elements of Marxism that makes the power elite quake in their shoes. This is what led me to read Marx years ago. I have been reading him ever since.</p>
<p align="left">Marx has helped me to comprehend why capitalists fear and loathe him. Deep down, they know that he was right. If workers understood capitalism from a Marxist perspective, not one in ten thousand would voluntarily accept their performative role in this exploitative economic system. There would be widespread conflict and social upheaval. There would be global revolution. The power elite spends trillions of dollars to maintain the façade of capitalism as a manifestation of democracy. In fact, I would argue that nothing could be more opposed to democracy than American capitalism.</p>
<p align="left">The key point to understand is that capitalism, a system based upon the ruthless exploitation and commodification of workers and the relentless rape of our Earth Mother, stifles and represses democracy. Capitalists abhor all forms of egalitarianism. Marx embraced them. The mere possibility of an empowered work force troubles the capitalist’s sleep, as did the possibility of slave rebellion, albeit it small, distress the slaveholder.</p>
<p align="left">Consider the vitriol, not to mention counter revolutionary forces that are levied against the alternatives to capitalism. What is their source? Who but wealthy capitalists fund America’s propaganda apparatus? Working people in the U.S. are conditioned to reflexively recoil against ideas they do not understand. They are psychologically programmed to detest that which could potentially set them free. American workers are led to believe that economic servitude and wage slavery is freedom.</p>
<p align="left">Why does a government that calls itself a democracy systemically spy on its citizens? Why does it punish its whistle blowers but materially reward the vilest white-collar criminals? Why is the majority of the U.S. budget spent on funding an insatiable war machine? Why do we raise classrooms of meat puppets rather than critical thinkers and political dissidents? It is all done for the benefit of capitalists at the expense of society.</p>
<p align="left">It is by these means that capitalism survives and spreads like an aggressive malignancy to every organ of the planet. Furthermore, the majority of the wealth produced by labor is subverted to prop up the capitalist system and to indoctrinate and oppress the worker. To the detriment of us all, freethinking and critical analysis are discouraged and often reprimanded in academia and elsewhere. And thus hundreds of millions of human beings are transformed into herd animals that are led to slaughter in the military and the world’s sweat shops. We celebrate our freedom and patriotism on our march to the scalding pots, singing “God Bless America.” There is no fight in us. We go too quietly and too obediently into the good night of eternity.</p>
<p align="left">Yet, despite everything and the repressive weight of history, Americans still have a propensity to believe in myths and fairy tales. Hope and faith in phony leaders and bogus institutions keep us servile and docile. Irrational faith requires nothing from us. Delusion has become the norm because too many of us are incapable of grappling with reality. We can and must do better than capitalism or we are doomed to an ignominious fate.</p>

<p><span>Adam Smith said governments are &#8220;instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor.&#8221; Wars are waged to make them richer.</span></p>
<p><span>Howard Zinn called war &#8220;terrorism magnified a hundred times.&#8221; Make it many thousands of times.</span></p>
<p><span>Michael Parenti said &#8220;the best way to win a Nobel Peace Prize (is) to wage war or support those who wage (it) instead of peace.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>In his book titled &#8220;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Face-Imperialism-Michael-Parenti/dp/1594519188"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Face of Imperialism</span></span></span></a><span>,&#8221; he discusses a richly financed military/industrial complex. Peter Phillips and Mickey Huff call it the &#8220;military-industrial media complex.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Waging wars requires selling them. Public support is needed. Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky call it &#8220;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-Media/dp/0375714499"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manufacturing Consent</span></span></span></a><span>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Propaganda works as intended. Minds are manipulated to support war. Truth is suppressed. Fear is stoked. Patriotism, national security, and democratic values are highlighted.</span></p>
<p><span>Longstanding US policy facilitates earning obscene amounts from militarism, wars, homeland security, and related operations.</span></p>
<p><span>Doing so has nothing to do with external or internal threats. It&#8217;s unrelated to spreading democracy. It isn&#8217;t about humanitarian intervention.</span></p>
<p><span>It about advancing America&#8217;s imperium. Parenti calls the process &#8220;the most powerful force in world history over the last four or five centuries. (It) &#8220;carves up whole continents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;(T)he dominant politico-economic interests of one nation expropriate for their own enrichment the land, labor, raw materials, and markets of another people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Capitalist imperialism differs from earlier forms. It dominates other economies and political systems. It accumulates enormous amounts of wealth.</span></p>
<p><span>It uses money to make more of it. It gains market control. It exploits resources and labor.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Marx and Engels:</span></p>
<p><span>Bourgeois capital &#8220;chases over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere&#8230;It creates a world after its own image.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Societies are destroyed and remade to do it. Nations are pillaged for profit. Populations become disenfranchised. Workers become serfs. Local cultures become mass-market consumer ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Agribusiness replaces local farming. Competitive industries are eliminated.  Foreign investment crowds out local capital.</span></p>
<p><span>Dominance legitimizes capital&#8217;s divine right. Plunder assures obscene profits. Capital accumulation demands more. Profiteering becomes a be-all-and-end-all.</span></p>
<p><span>Businesses price according to what the market will bear. Profiteers take advantage of emergency or other out-of-ordinary conditions to cash in excessively.</span></p>
<p><span>WikiLeaks calls profiteering &#8220;a pejorative term for the act of making profit by methods considered unethical.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Price fixing is illegal. Price gouging reflects grabbing all you can. It&#8217;s charging more than what&#8217;s considered reasonable and fair.</span></p>
<p><span>War profiteers are in a class by themselves. They thrive on war. They depend on it. Their businesses require conflicts and instability to prosper. The more ongoing, the greater the potential profits.</span></p>
<p><span>Lot of players profit from wars. Companies develop technologies with military applications. Black marketeers cash in.</span></p>
<p><span>Politicians taking campaign contributions, special favors or bribes benefit handsomely. Nations do by acquiring control over territory, resources and exploitable people.</span></p>
<p><span>Private military contractors include companies offering a wide range of services. They provide everything from tactical combat to security to consulting to logistics to technical support.</span></p>
<p><span>In his book titled &#8220;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Halliburtons-Army-Well-Connected-Company-Revolutionized/dp/1568584431"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Halliburton&#8217;s Army: How a Well-Connected Texas Oil Company Revolutionized the Way America Makes War</span></span></span></a><span>,&#8221; Pratap Chatterjee describes a company tainted by sweetheart deal no-bid contacts, bribes, kickbacks, inefficiency, shoddy work, corruption, fraud, gross overcharging, worker exploitation, and other serious offenses.</span></p>
<p><span>Other companies operate the same way. Military spending is hugely wasteful. Fraud and abuse are rampant. War is extremely profitable. Why else would so many be waged.</span></p>
<p><span>Mercenaries are guns for hire. They&#8217;re for sale to the highest bidder. They&#8217;re in it for the money. They&#8217;re unchecked, unaccountable and unprincipled.</span></p>
<p><span>Arms and munitions companies benefit most. Amounts spent are mind-bogging.</span></p>
<p><span>Bloomberg says defense budgets &#8220;contain hundreds of billions of dollars for new generations of aircraft carriers and stealth fighters, tanks that even the Army says it doesn&#8217;t need and combat vehicles too heavy to maneuver in desert sands or cross most bridges in Asia, Africa, or the Middle East.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>According to BusinessWeek, redundancy wastes lots of money. &#8220;One need only spend 10 minutes walking around the Pentagon or any major military headquarters to see&#8221; it.</span></p>
<p><span>Why doesn&#8217;t Congress trim fat? Because politicians want lots of pork for constituents. It&#8217;s a great vote-getter.</span></p>
<p><span>BusinessWeek explained more, saying:</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Why is sensible military budgeting so difficult? Because lawmakers, including small-government Republicans, protect defense business in their home states with the ferocity of Spartans.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Even if the Pentagon offered up (sensible) cuts&#8230;Congress would almost certainly reject them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The senators and representatives don&#8217;t have the political courage to face voters and tell them that the republic simply does not need the weapon under construction in their hometown.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Trillions of dollars are spent.  Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta once said DOD &#8220;is the only major federal agency that cannot pass an audit today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Even during October&#8217;s 16 day shutdown, huge amounts of wasteful spending continued.</span></p>
<p><span>Ralph Nader calls now the time to address bloated military spending. Let&#8217;s &#8220;start shutting down the waste and fraud in our military budget,&#8221; he stresses.</span></p>
<p><span>Billions get tossed around mindlessly. Profiteers never had it better. Government watchdogs identify hundreds of billions of potential savings from unneeded weapons, defective ones, no-bid excess, overpayments, and outright fraud.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="http://www.sipri.org/"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</span></span></span></a><span> (SIPRI) conducts research on security, war and peace.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;A world in which sources of insecurity are identified and understood, conflicts are prevented or resolved, and peace is sustained,&#8221; it says.</span></p>
<p><span>It reports on &#8220;recent trends in military expenditure(s).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Amounts spent are huge. In 2012, nominal </span><a href="http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=458"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">global military spending</span></span></span></a><span> exceeded $1.7 trillion. It&#8217;s around historic highs.</span></p>
<p><span>In real terms, it exceeds peak amounts spent during the Cold War. Post-9/11, spending increased sharply. America led the way.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2012, </span><a href="http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/Top%2015%20table%202012.pdf"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">15 nations</span></span></span></a><span> accounted for over 80% military spending. SIPRI lists them as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>America: $682 billion &#8211; 39%</span></li>
<li><span>China: $166 billion &#8211; 9.5%</span></li>
<li><span>Russia: $90.7 billion &#8211; 5.2%</span></li>
<li><span>Britain: $60.8 billion &#8211; 3.5%</span></li>
<li><span>Japan: 59.3 billion &#8211; 3.4%</span></li>
<li><span>France: $58.9 billion &#8211; 3.4%</span></li>
<li><span>Saudi Arabia: $56.7 billion &#8211; 3.2%</span></li>
<li><span>India: $46.1 billion &#8211; 2.6%</span></li>
<li><span>Germany: $45.8 billion &#8211; 2.6%</span></li>
<li><span>Italy: $34 billion &#8211; 1.9%</span></li>
<li><span>Brazil: $33.1 billion &#8211; 1.9%</span></li>
<li><span>South Korea: $31.7 billion &#8211; 1.8%</span></li>
<li><span>Australia: $26.2 billion &#8211; 1.5%</span></li>
<li><span>Canada: $22.5 billion &#8211; 1.3%</span></li>
<li><span>Turkey: $18.2 billion &#8211; 1%</span></li>
<li><span>Others 18%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>SIPRI calculates nominal military spending. Amounts America spends far exceeds annual defense authorizations.</span></p>
<p><span>Other allocations are for the Energy Department, State Department, Department of Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, Treasury, NASA, military construction, various categories related to security, and interest attributable to past defense outlays.</span></p>
<p><span>Black intelligence, Pentagon and other budgets add many tens of billions more. So do supplemental military allocations. Foreign aid is mostly military related.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/fullpage/top-10-us-foreign-aid-recipients-17534761"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Library of Congress</span></span></span></a><span> listed the top 10 2012 recipients and amounts as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>Israel: $3.075 billion</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Israel gets special benefits provided no other nations.</span></p>
<p><span>They include annual $3 billion + direct appropriations, undisclosed additional amounts, state-of-the-art weapons and technology, billions in loan guarantees, military loans as grants, privileged contracts for Israeli companies, trade exemptions, and more.</span></p>
<p><span>Special allocations are buried in various agency budgets. Low or no-interest loans are provided. Some are never repaid. Most often, whatever Israel wants it gets.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Afghanistan: $2.327 billion</span></li>
<li><span>Pakistan: $2.102 billion</span></li>
<li><span>Iraq: $1.683 billion</span></li>
<li><span>Egypt: $1.557 billion</span></li>
<li><span>Jordan: $676 million</span></li>
<li><span>Kenya: $652 million</span></li>
<li><span>Nigeria: $625 million</span></li>
<li><span>Ethiopia: $580 million</span></li>
<li><span>Tanzania: $531 million</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>US defense related spending exceeds $1.5 trillion annually. It&#8217;s half or more what other nations spend in total.</span></p>
<p><span>Militarism defines America. So do permanent wars. They&#8217;re a national addiction. They&#8217;re part of the national culture.</span></p>
<p><span>Violence is the American way. Wars are glorified. Pacifism is considered sissy. Peace is deplored. Conflicts persist with no end.</span></p>
<p><span>War profiteers gorge themselves at the public trough. Their operations thrive on war. They depend on it.</span></p>
<p><span>They&#8217;re waged for profit and dominance. They continue without end. Peace is verboten. It&#8217;s a convenient illusion.</span></p>
<p><span>Howard Zinn once asked &#8220;(h)ow can you have a war on terrorism when war itself is terrorism?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;There is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Why most Americans put up with it they&#8217;ll have to explain. Doing so lets Washington get away with mass murder and then some. It lets war profiteers benefit at our expense.</span></p>

<p>A couple of decades ago we were discussing whether or not American soldiers would fire on U. S. citizens?  Many thought they would balk at such a travesty.  Now it is common knowledge that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tpnn.com%2Fobama-reported-to-be-dismissing-military-leaders-who-will-not-fire-on-civilians-if-ordered%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxt8asAxM63a1hTjdE_SVTvxpDeQ" target="_blank">Army leaders are selected</a> on their willingness to do just that.  Troops are trained to do what they are told and when they are ordered to do evil deeds only a tiny number resist; some even relish the savagery.</p>
<p>If you are dubious consider the present state of law enforcement in the United States.  Citizens are handcuffed and arrested for trivial offenses and for no offense. They are murdered in their homes by policemen who invade by mistake.  Young men who resist their absolute power are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.desmoinesregister.com%2Farticle%2F20131106%2FNEWS%2F311060044%2FExclusive-Interview-In-ISU-case-police-action-baffles-family%3FFrontpage%26gcheck%3D1%26nclick_check%3D1&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEEgqR1xX8pdS7t7ij6omKEKSp5xg" target="_blank">killed or beaten into submission</a> and even women are not immune to their violent demands.  There is little accountability for these savage encounters.</p>
<p>When nations decline and hunger sets its teeth into society, major violence begins and when violence begins those who fight it become equally violent.</p>
<p>Ambition often trumps righteousness.  Sacrificing principle to achieve personal advancement is common strategy for those who seek power.  Shakespeare wrote, “Let me have men about me that are fat, sleek-headed men and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look, He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.”  Our government is full of lean, hungry, ambitious men and women!</p>
<p>The sin of leaders is greater than the sin of followers but both are culpable.</p>
<p>When a society is subjected to massive amounts of propaganda and leaders are forced by an agenda driven media to support its erroneous content, prevarications become the basis for actions that create a vortex of injustice and confusion.  This is where we are in America.  What began as little propagandas has metastasized and overcome our society.  Both leaders and followers overlook innumerable falsehoods.  The tangle has reached such proportions and goes so deep that it is difficult to find a thruthful consensus.</p>
<p>Confusion is used by shadowy oligarchs to control people and nations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the initial fault was not in our leadership but in our culture.  We failed to confront dishonesty and turpitude in our homes, our churches, our businesses, and our government.  Our failure to confront evil has allowed evil to flourish.  We have re-elected politicians who have voted for legislation that has destroyed our government. We have allowed our schools to instruct our children in a morally empty humanism.  We have closed our eyes to the accumulation of power that has allowed a handful of like-minded individuals to control information.  We have allowed our church leaders to evade their responsibility to address and uphold our moral standards.  We have voted for the lessor to two evils when we should have shunned the electoral process in protest.</p>
<p>American politics is hopelessly corrupt.  Meaningful political change is impossible.</p>
<p>Penny’s Department Stores hired an executive from another industry who spent millions of dollars offering the public an honest price structure.  His attempt to bring truth to the retail business almost bankrupted the company.  It seems that American citizens would rather live in a titillating fantasy of lies than in mundane reality.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fredoneverything.net%2FVets.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAdy8jaU11yr5BVbrOeCrwlY7zWw" target="_blank">Fred Reed has written a descriptive article</a> about support for our military.  Americans are jingoistic; we are quick to support war and have a romantic relationship with our armed forces.  We are not concerned that war is state sanctioned murder which seldom accomplishes anything.  We are quick to believe the devious propagandists who inflict false hate on our society.  We hate Muslims because we are told they hate us because of our freedom.  We hated Germans and Japanese during WWII and transferred that substantial hate to Communists during the Korean conflict and Vietnam.  We prefer emotional patriotism to denouncing the butchery of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAmerican_exceptionalism&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGU9b1JC5dm3myRSwHW5haCFUM1Pw" target="_blank">exceptionalism</a>.  We have forgotten that every human being is created in God’s image that He loves everyone.  We have forgotten that the murder of innocent citizens in foreign lands is a national breach of the Commandment not to kill.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary War helped relieve us of English domination and other wars gained territory but wars from the Twentieth Century forward were useless.  They made some citizens wealthy while killing millions of innocent people, disrupting our nation, destroying our morals, and injured our youth.</p>
<p>We should be ashamed when our churches support war by asking us to pray for our troops.  We have the audacity to come before the King and Kings praying for his support in the murder of millions of people made in His image.  It is devilish silliness when Christian churches implore the Prince of Peace to aide in mass murder!</p>
<p>There has been steady resistance to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRoe_v._Wade&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFfPL2tgmsTV2AZep7lZt1mYXpoQA" target="_blank">legalization of abortion</a> by a morally bankrupt Supreme Court.  But the resistance seldom deplores the fact that the choice to murder a baby is made by the woman who carries it.   A moral nation would not use such a service!   Our nation is said to be divided over abortion; half for and half against.  If that is true half of our citizens support the murder of babies.  Isn’t it time our churches began to teach God’s moral code so that at least a majority of our citizens understand the Second Commandment by rejecting murder whether in the womb or by armed force?</p>
<p>A media conspiracy censors and distorts the news preventing Americans from knowing and understanding large amounts of important information.  Conspiracies are ubiquitous; they are common in homes, in churches, in businesses, and schools; when people gather with a common goal conspiracy of some sort soon follows.  To believe they are not common in government and the media is a serious distortion of reality.  The press censors all suggestion of conspiracy and demonizes the word. We have failed to confront this serious distortion of reality.</p>
<p>Sanguinity has replaced obedience and become the objective of our churches.  Christian churches that offer an emotional escape from reality are growing by leaps and bounds.  Healing, tongues, inspiring music, and a positive message attract a work warn populace.  Instead of confronting pervasive evil and teaching the Path to Righteousness and Peace church leaders allow their parishioners to behave like Hophni and Phinehas,  (Read about the fate of their Father, Eli, in 1 Samuel 4)</p>
<p>A thoughtful bystander watching our government leaders on C-Span has to wonder how they can destroy our freedom over a bogus threat of terrorism and still sleep at night.  President George W. Bush told us we were fighting in the Middle East to preserve our freedom.  Now that our freedom is being threatened we are blaming it on terrorists who might be a creation of the bogus wars we are fighting.  While we allow immigrants of all ilks to enter our country legally and illegally we train our army to put down civil unrest.  We spend more money on armaments than the rest of the world combined but still are expected to give up freedom for protection.  We are being governed by lies, terrorism has never been a major threat to our nation and it is a form on insanity when our leaders pass freedom threatening laws to counter a bogus enemy.</p>
<p>For more than two millenniums Christianity has offered hope to the world, but centralized power has always created kings and tyrants.  We have failed to follow the Biblical pattern by decentralizing power to the individual family.  Because we have failed to obeyed His Commandments, the blessings of obedience have never been realized.  As time goes on Christianity is gaining ground but we are now in one of the darkest periods the world has ever known.  This period of darkness will eventually end and Christianity will be victorious.  God will continue to extend His Kingdom.  In the meantime Christians are ordered to stand.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/newworldreligion-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/newworldreligion-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>With over 500 pages and 1,200 footnotes, Ted Flynn’s book, “<em>Hope of the Wicked: the Master Plan to Rule the World,”</em> details many of the agendas of the global ‘elite’ community.  With several thousand quotes it uses the words of prime ministers, secretaries of treasury, secretaries of state, philanthropists and global business leaders to describe their NWO vision and their plans to bring it about as well as the convergence, on a global basis, of multinational corporations, foundations and the political and sociological instruments that would form a one-world government designed to bring about a New World Order.</p>
<p>Flynn writes that there is a confluence of events pointing to major changes that for many years have been coming to the world and they appear to be coming toward us more quickly now. Flynn argues that an 1846 heavenly apparition, a prophecy delivered by the Blessed Virgin Mary to two peasant children and approved by the Catholic Church is a stark and terrible summary of the major changes that have been coming to the world in general but the West and America in particular:</p>
<p>“<i>All the civil governments will have one and the same plan, which will be to abolish and do away with every religious principle, to make way for materialism, atheism, spiritualism and vice of all kinds….The mountains and all Nature will tremble in terror, for the disorders and crimes of men have pierced the vault of the heavens…The righteous will suffer greatly.  Their prayers, their penances and their tears will rise up to Heaven and all of God’s people will beg for forgiveness and mercy…And then Jesus Christ, in an act of His justice and His great mercy will command His Angels to have all His enemies put to death….and the persecutors of the Church of Jesus Christ and all those given over to sin will perish</i>…”  (p. 445)</p>
<p>In another apparition approved by the Church, the Blessed Virgin Mary warned of the “<i>annihilation of nations</i>.” (ibid, p. 445) </p>
<p><strong>Materialism, Atheism, Communism, &amp; Annihilation of Nations and People</strong></p>
<p>Friedrich Engels (1820-1895), a 19<sup>th</sup> century German political philosopher figures prominently in Karl Marx’s life.  Beginning in 1844, Engels and Marx, a God-hating materialist, collaborated closely in the foundation of modern Communism.  By 1848 they had produced The Communist Manifesto and similar works.</p>
<p>The tragedy of Engels is that before joining forces with Marx he had been a faithful Christian.  After meeting Marx for the first time he described him as a monster subjected to devils.  Marx does not,</p>
<p>“…<i>walk or run, he jumps on his heels full of anger…He stretches his arms far away in the air; the wicked fist is clenched, he rages without ceasing, as if ten thousand devils had caught him by the hair</i>.”  (Marx &amp; Satan, Richard Wurmbrand, p. 36)</p>
<p>Engels was very well aware of the dangers of entangling himself with devilish sons of perdition like Marx.  In his book, “<i>Schelling, Philosopher in Christ</i>,” he warns that a devilish spirit has entered into a great part of mankind in the heart of Christendom and now there are only two kinds of men, Christians and anti-Christians:</p>
<p>“<i>Since the terrible French Revolution, an entirely new, devilish spirit has entered into a great part of mankind, and godlessness lifts its daring head in such an unashamed and subtle manner that you would think the prophecies of Scripture are fulfilled (Matthew 24:11)..And St. Paul says in II Thes. 2:3: That man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is God, or that is worshipped…The coming of the Wicked is after the working of Satan….(therefore we must have)  nothing to do any more with indifference or coldness toward the Lord (for as of now) we have only…Christians and anti-Christians….We see the false prophets among us…They travel throughout Germany and wish to intrude everywhere; they teach their Satanic teachings in the market-places and bear the flag of the Devil from one town to another, seducing the poor youth, in order to throw them in the deepest abyss of hell and death.”</i> (ibid, p. 40)</p>
<p>The devilish fleshy spirit responsible for converting Engels to godless Communism was Moses Hess, the same man who had previously converted Marx. After meeting Engels in Cologne Hess wrote:</p>
<p>“<i>He parted from me as an overzealous Communist.  This is how I produce ravages</i>…” (ibid, p. 43)</p>
<p>The spiritual counter-conversion of Engels was striking and hideous.  Like Marx, he no longer cared about the destruction of millions of people on behalf of the Revolution. </p>
<p>A bloodless Marx writes of the coming genocide of millions of men, women, and children:</p>
<p><i>“A silent, unavoidable revolution is taking place in society, a revolution that cares as little about the human lives it destroys as an earthquake cares about the houses it ravages.  Classes and races…too weak to dominate the new conditions of existence will be defeated.”</i> (ibid, p. 42)</p>
<p>In a similar vein, a cold-hearted Engels speaks of the coming annihilation of millions of Christians, Jews, and other peoples and nations:</p>
<p>“<i>The next world war will make whole reactionary peoples disappear from the face of the earth.  This, too, is progress.  Obviously this cannot be fulfilled without crushing some delicate national flower.   But without violence and without pitilessness nothing can be obtained in history</i>.”  (p. 43) </p>
<p><strong>The Revolution</strong></p>
<p>The Revolution is a movement of spirit having its taproot and energy in the devil, the spirit of hate, murder, atheism, apostasy, and ‘this world only’ naturalism, materialism, pantheism, and spiritualism.   The Revolution is war against the supernatural Trinity, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, which in the words of Marx’s anarchist comrade Bakunin, are the “<em>cursed and fatal principle of authority</em>.”</p>
<p>The sentiment of the Revolution is satanic pride:</p>
<p>&#8220;….<i>which spurns subjection to any master whatever, whether of divine or human origin.&#8221; (</i>Bakunin<i>, Nihilism: The Root of the Revolution of the Modern Age</i>, Fr. Seraphim Rose, p. 63)</p>
<p>The nature of the Revolution is the antithesis of authentic Christian faith. Whereas Christian faith is joy, patience, love, truth, humbleness, perseverance, submission in all things to the Will of God and blessed eternal life in Paradise (earth perfected), the Satanic counterfeit is full of hatred, rebelliousness, burning envy and covetousness against man and God, ingratitude, mockery, doubts, lies, revulsion, blasphemy, thoughts of murder and eternal life in Hell.</p>
<p>Fueled by monstrously inflated pride and dissatisfaction with self, the world, society, and God the Father Almighty, it devotes its&#8217; infernal energy toward &#8220;<i>change</i>,&#8221; or as Marx put it, toward the wholesale destruction of the Christian-based Old Order and the establishment of a religiously pantheist, totalitarian world order because:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The idea of God is the keynote of a perverted civilization. It must be destroyed</i>.&#8221; (Karl Marx, <i>Marx and Satan</i>, p. 59)  </p>
<p><b>The New World Religion  </b></p>
<p> “(The UN is) <i>a weird and diabolical convergence of New Age mysticism, pantheism, aboriginal animism, Communism, socialism, Luciferian occultism, apostate Christianity, Islam, Taoism, Buddhism, and Hinduism.”</i>   (The New World Religion: Teaching God’s Children to Worship ‘Divine Nature.’ William Jasper, 2002)</p>
<p>The Revolution, of which the U.N., Lucis Trust (formerly Lucifer Publishing), the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the Temple of Understanding and Baca Grande (Colorado based New Age Vatican City) are integral components, intends the complete overturning of Biblical moral and spiritual values enjoyed by Western and American civilization for over a thousand years.  As part of this goal, the Bible must be reinterpreted in terms of evolutionary pantheism, man must be fundamentally remade by eradication of every vestige of Imago Dei from his inner being, and Christian leadership reduced to a non-factor.  Flynn writes that this has largely been accomplished,</p>
<p><i>“…by placing their own leaders in place where they exert tremendous influence.  Much of this program of revolution was confirmed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in his book, ‘Our Way’ </i>(which)<i> summed up, the spiritual and immoral goals of world revolution </i>(and how they)<i> are being achieved, and nowhere more so than in the United States.”</i> (Flynn, p. 361)</p>
<p>Primary goals are:</p>
<blockquote><p>a. Destruction of the Christian-based foundation of Western and American civilization;</p>
<p>b. Dissolution of legal government;</p>
<p>c. Destruction of sovereignty and patriotism;</p>
<p>d. Demoralizing, atheitizing and bringing the people of the United States into slavery via liberated sin nature and penury via graduated income taxes, property taxes, inheritance taxes, sales taxes, a massive welfare state and now socialized healthcare;</p>
<p>e. The abolition of God-given right to life via reproductive rights (abortion) and euthanasia and of private property via onerous building codes, zoning regulations and restrictions and by taxing property out of existence and targeting inheritance with bigger and bigger taxes;</p>
<p>f. Destruction of the traditional monogamous family unit via divorce, co-habitation, alternative lifestyles, abortion, pornography, hedonism and homosexuality</p></blockquote>
<p>Before the top-down spiritually pantheist world order dominated by an occult ‘elite’ can come into existence, there must be a politically correct philosophy of ‘new’ thought and a philosophy of pantheist-based natural religion and natural science to usher in the coming political, social, legal and educational aspects of the new order since New Age evolutionary pantheism is a politically communist, ecologically ‘sustainable,’ sexually androgynous way of living.</p>
<p>In her two books on New Age evolutionary pantheism, ‘<i>The Hidden Rainbow</i>,’ and ‘<i>A Planned Deception,’</i> Constance Cumbey writes that these goals have largely been accomplished:</p>
<p>“<i>The New Age Movement is a religion complete with its own Bibles, prayers and mantras, Vatican City/Jerusalem equivalents, priests and gurus, born again experiences (they call it ‘rebirthing’), spiritual laws and commandments, psychics and prophets and nearly every other indicia of a religion</i>.” (Flynn, p. 361)</p>
<p>According to Cumbey, the Plan for the new order includes the installation of a New Age messiah, implementation of a New Age totalitarian government and new world religion under Maitreya.  As well, there are plans to implement a universal identification system, universal credit system, universal tax, universal draft, and a world food and water authority that will control all of the world’s food and water supplies.  To ensure that all people worship the New Age messiah, authentic Christianity will be completely stamped out along with all faithful Christians.</p>
<p>Toward this end, the evil spirit energizing and directing the Revolution intends to fully possess the Christian faith and refashion it completely.  In furtherance of his goal, the devil has audaciously declared that the supernatural Holy God the Father Almighty has been isolated in His transcendence and is therefore dead, so though the notion of God is retained, the devil proposes a functionless God that perhaps serves to ignite the Big Bang and set evolution in motion.  </p>
<p> According to the devil, the Revolution is now moving with great force and speed across America nearly unopposed and will not stop until every vestige of faith in the supernatural God has been obliterated in every heart. Every man, woman, and child will experience a counter-conversion&#8212;a Satanic Initiation in the words of New Age insider David Spangler&#8212;to a ‘new’ pantheist spiritualism dressed in Christian symbols and terminology, an anti-gospel preached by anti-saints from the void who will assure men of their salvation though they will find only the leering face of the devil.</p>

</div>
<p>There is a new normal in America: our government may shut down, but our wars continue.  Congress may not be able to pass a budget, but the U.S. military can still launch commando raids in Libya and Somalia, the Afghan War can still be <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175754/" target="_blank">prosecuted</a>, Italy can be <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175755/" target="_blank">garrisoned</a> by American troops (putting the “empire” back in Rome), Africa can be used as an <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175743" target="_blank">imperial playground</a> (as in the late nineteenth century “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0380719991/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20" target="_blank">scramble for Africa</a>,” but with the U.S. and China doing the scrambling this time around), and the military-industrial complex can still <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175493" target="_blank">dominate</a> the world’s arms trade.</p>
<p>In the halls of Congress and the Pentagon, it’s business as usual, if your definition of “business” is the power and profits you get from constantly preparing for and prosecuting wars around the world.  “War is a racket,” General Smedley Butler <a href="http://contraryperspective.com/2013/05/30/war-is-a-racket/" target="_blank">famously declared</a> in 1935, and even now it’s hard to disagree with a man who had two Congressional Medals of Honor to his credit and was intimately familiar with American imperialism.</p>
<p><strong>War Is Politics, Right?</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time, as a serving officer in the U.S. Air Force, I was taught that Carl von Clausewitz had defined war as a continuation of politics by other means.  This definition is, in fact, a simplification of his classic and complex book, <em>On War</em>, written after his experiences fighting Napoleon in the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forever war is forever profitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea of war as a continuation of politics is both moderately interesting and dangerously misleading: interesting because it connects war to political processes and suggests that they should be fought for political goals; misleading because it suggests that war is essentially rational and so controllable.  The fault here is not Clausewitz’s, but the American military’s for <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175208/" target="_blank">misreading</a> and oversimplifying him.</p>
<p>Perhaps another “Carl” might lend a hand when it comes to helping Americans understand what war is really all about.  I’m referring to Karl Marx, who admired Clausewitz, notably for his idea that combat is to war what a cash payment is to commerce.  However seldom combat (or such payments) may happen, they are the culmination and so the ultimate arbiters of the process.</p>
<p>War, in other words, is settled by killing, a bloody transaction that echoes the exploitative exchanges of capitalism.  Marx found this idea to be both suggestive and pregnant with meaning. So should we all.</p>
<p>Following Marx, Americans ought to think about war not just as an extreme exercise of politics, but also as a continuation of exploitative commerce by other means.  Combat as commerce: there’s more in that than simple alliteration.</p>
<p>In the history of war, such commercial transactions took many forms, whether as territory conquered, spoils carted away, raw materials appropriated, or market share gained.  Consider American wars.  The War of 1812 is sometimes portrayed as a minor dust-up with Britain, involving the temporary occupation and burning of our capital, but it really was about crushing Indians on the frontier and grabbing their land.  The Mexican-American War was another land grab, this time for the benefit of slaveholders.  The Spanish-American War was a land grab for those seeking an American empire overseas, while World War I was for making the world “safe for democracy” &#8212; and for American business interests globally.</p>
<p>Even World War II, a war necessary to stop Hitler and Imperial Japan, witnessed the emergence of the U.S. as the arsenal of democracy, the world’s dominant power, and the new imperial stand-in for a bankrupt British Empire.</p>
<p>Korea?  Vietnam?  Lots of profit for the military-industrial complex and plenty of power for the Pentagon establishment.  Iraq, the Middle East, current adventures in Africa?  Oil, markets, natural resources, global dominance.</p>
<p>In societal calamities like war, there will always be winners and losers.  But the clearest winners are often companies like Boeing and Dow Chemical, which provided B-52 bombers and Agent Orange, respectively, to the U.S. military in Vietnam.  Such “arms merchants” &#8212; an older, more honest term than today’s “defense contractor” &#8212; don’t have to pursue the hard sell, not when war and preparations for it have become so permanently, inseparably intertwined with the American economy, foreign policy, and our nation’s identity as a rugged land of “warriors” and “heroes” (more on that in a moment).</p>
<p><strong>War as Disaster Capitalism</strong></p>
<p>Consider one more definition of war: not as politics or even as commerce, but as societal catastrophe.  Thinking this way, we can apply Naomi Klein&#8217;s concepts of the &#8220;<a href="http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine" target="_blank">shock doctrine</a>&#8221; and &#8220;disaster capitalism&#8221; to it.  When such disasters occur, there are always those who seek to turn a profit.</p>
<p>Most Americans are, however, discouraged from thinking about war this way thanks to the power of what we call “patriotism” or, at an extreme, “superpatriotism” when it applies to us, and the significantly more negative “nationalism” or “ultra-nationalism” when it appears in other countries.  During wars, we’re told to “<a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175357/" target="_blank">support our troops</a>,” to wave the flag, to put country first, to respect the patriotic ideal of selfless service and redemptive sacrifice (even if all but 1% of us are never expected to serve or sacrifice).</p>
<p>We’re discouraged from reflecting on the uncomfortable fact that, as “our” troops sacrifice and suffer, others in society are profiting big time.  Such thoughts are considered unseemly and unpatriotic.  Pay no attention to the war profiteers, who pass as perfectly respectable companies.  After all, any price is worth paying (or profits worth offering up) to contain the enemy &#8212; not so long ago, the red menace, but in the twenty-first century, the murderous terrorist.</p>
<p>Forever war is forever profitable.  Think of the <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175339/william_hartung_lockheed_martin%27s_shadow_government" target="_blank">Lockheed Martins</a><strong> </strong>of the world.  In their commerce with the Pentagon, as well as the militaries of other nations, they ultimately seek cash payment for their weapons and a world in which such weaponry will be eternally needed.  In the pursuit of security or victory, political leaders willingly pay their price.</p>
<p>Call it a Clausewitzian/Marxian feedback loop or the dialectic of Carl and Karl.  It also represents the eternal marriage of combat and commerce.  If it doesn’t catch all of what war is about, it should at least remind us of the degree to which war as disaster capitalism is driven by profit and power.</p>
<p>For a synthesis, we need only turn from Carl or Karl to Cal &#8212; President Calvin Coolidge, that is.  “The business of America is business,” he declared in the Roaring Twenties.  Almost a century later, the business of America is war, even if today’s presidents are too polite to mention that the business is booming.</p>
<p><strong>America’s War Heroes as Commodities</strong></p>
<p>Many young people today are, in fact, looking for a release from consumerism.  In seeking new identities, quite a few turn to the military.  And it provides.  Recruits are hailed as <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174957" target="_blank">warriors and warfighters</a>, as <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175276" target="_blank">heroes</a>, and not just within the military either, but by <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175423/andrew_bacevich_ballpark_liturgy" target="_blank">society at large</a>.</p>
<p>Yet in joining the military and being celebrated for that act, our troops paradoxically become yet another commodity, another consumable of the state.  Indeed, they become consumed by war and its violence.  Their compensation?  To be packaged and marketed as the heroes of our militarized moment. Steven Gardiner, a cultural anthropologist and U.S. Army veteran, has written eloquently about what he calls the “<a href="http://www.libraryofsocialscience.com/ideologies/docs/Gardiner-HeroicMasochism.pdf" target="_blank">heroic masochism</a>” of militarized settings and their allure for America’s youth.  Put succinctly, in seeking to escape a consumerism that has lost its meaning and find a release from dead-end jobs, many volunteers are transformed into celebrants of violence, seekers and givers of pain, a harsh reality Americans ignore as long as that violence is acted out overseas against our enemies and local populations.</p>
<p>Such “heroic” identities, tied so closely to violence in war, often prove poorly suited to peacetime settings.  Frustration and demoralization devolve into <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175663/" target="_blank">domestic violence</a> and <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/14/16510852-military-suicide-rate-hit-record-high-in-2012?lite" target="_blank">suicide</a>.  In an American society with ever fewer meaningful peacetime jobs, exhibiting greater and greater polarization of wealth and opportunity, the decisions of some veterans to turn to or return to mind-numbing drugs of various sorts and soul-stirring violence is tragically predictable.  That it stems from their exploitative commodification as so many heroic inflictors of violence in our name is a reality most Americans are content to forget.</p>
<p><strong>You May Not Be Interested in War, but War Is Interested in You</strong></p>
<p>As Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky pithily observed, “You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.”  If war is combat and commerce, calamity and commodity, it cannot be left to our political leaders alone &#8212; and certainly not to our generals.  When it comes to war, however far from it we may seem to be, we’re all in our own ways customers and consumers.  Some pay a high price.  Many pay a little.  A few gain a lot.  Keep an eye on those few and you’ll end up with a keener appreciation of what war is actually all about.</p>
<p>No wonder our leaders tell us not to worry our little heads about our wars &#8212; just support those troops, go shopping, and keep waving that flag.  If patriotism is famously the last refuge of the scoundrel, it’s also the first recourse of those seeking to mobilize customers for the latest bloodletting exercise in combat as commerce.</p>
<p>Just remember: in the grand bargain that is war, it’s their product and their profit.  And that’s no bargain for America, or for that matter for the world.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“There was, of course, no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, The Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate, they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live — did live, from habit that became instinct — in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every move was scrutinized.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The above quote is from <strong><em>1984</em></strong>, by George Orwell. The now-famous date that Orwell chose was actually of no real significance. He simply reversed the last two digits of the year in which he wrote the book, 1948. Orwell concerned himself less with timeline than with concept. And that concept has been chillingly accurate in its foresight.</p>
<p>The quote above should ring alarm bells in today’s world, particularly for those who live in the US, as the US government leads the world in the development of surveillance of its people.</p>
<p>Today, the US government is in the process of completing a massive electronic surveillance network that encompasses all telephone calls, all computer-driven communication, and all banking transactions. Quite a tribute to Orwell’s Big Brother.</p>
<p>We have in the past predicted that the surveillance net will eventually expand to include all monetary transactions by US residents (possibly through the replacement of the paper dollar by an electronic money system), allowing the US government to ultimately have knowledge of every aspect of the economic activities of US residents and, therefore, control over those activities.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>(Editor’s note: this is known as the “war on cash;” see more <a href="http://www.internationalman.com/im-forum/11-General-Conversation/21071-the-international-war-on-cash-and-your-privacy" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> and from Dr. Joe Salerno <a href="https://mises.org/daily/5968/Laundered-Money" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The excuse given for such surveillance has been “to protect America from terrorism.” This notion is a wonderful invention, as terrorism can be imagined to be small or large and can occur at anytime, anywhere in the country. Further, if there are no actual occurrences, the government can create false flag incidents as easily and as often as they are needed.</p>
<p>The bogeyman of <a href="http://www.internationalman.com/78-global-perspectives/1008-just-say-the-magic-word?acm=4099_183" target="_blank">“<strong>terrorism</strong>“</a> is particularly useful, as terrorism is faceless. No invasion is necessary. A terrorist can be anyone — even your next door neighbour and, indeed, the government computers are programmed to pay especially close heed to specific words and phrases, such as “freedom” or “patriotism.” Should your next door neighbour use such words in his emails, he is more likely to be flagged.</p>
<p>The degree of surveillance that Orwell described in <em>1984</em> has not yet been reached, but it is not far off. Most importantly, though, the most essential aspect of its implementation has already been overcome — the aspect of popular acceptance. The American people, in the main, have successfully been sold the concept that it is necessary in order to keep Americans “safe from terrorism.”</p>
<p>With this green light, the US government is moving rapidly toward the completion of the implementation of full surveillance.</p>
<p>If any American doubts that this is coming, he need only ask himself whether the present wiretaps, warrantless house raids, and TSA shakedowns would have been possible only a generation ago.</p>
<p>Americans are already being conditioned to understand that, if they object to these intrusions, that only makes them more suspect. Citizens are already being encouraged to report any “suspicious” activity they observe in their fellow citizens, or indeed, even in their own families. It is almost as if <em>1984</em> had been used as a guide in creating the new USA.</p>
<p>Of course, it is admittedly easy for non-Americans such as myself to criticise. We lose nothing by suggesting that those who are in a country that is in a state of dramatic decline, plan their exits whist it is still possible. After all, we are not the ones who would be leaving our home, job, and possibly family members behind. We are, in fact, already comfortably settled in our own countries — countries that may actually be thriving and promising us a positive future.</p>
<p>And there is another factor that makes it easy for us. Those Americans that we do meet are generally those who have already left — who have plucked up their courage and made an exit to friendlier, more promising shores. Not surprisingly, they tend to be very positive people.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who remain in the US are surrounded by <em>others</em> who, at least at present, have chosen to remain. Therefore, to actually entertain the idea of escaping the oppression of an over-reaching government (not to mention a collapsing economic system and perpetual warfare) is a lonely pursuit indeed.</p>
<p>For anyone to actually raise himself up to see the forest for the trees is, in itself, a <em>major</em>feat. To actually conceive of and then plan an actual exit to greener pastures is an even greater one.</p>
<p>It is easy for all of us, no matter where we are, to observe that the end product (that of<em>1984</em>) is abhorrent and unfit for humanity. However, the end product does not occur all in one fell swoop. Like the boiling of a frog, it is made possible, first, by the comforting warmth of the water, which increases slowly in temperature, lulling the frog into complacency until he is too sleepy to jump out of the pot.</p>
<p>The US began as, very possibly, the most ideal republic ever conceived. Yet, at intervals, over the last 237 years, the original ideals have been stripped away and, in recent years, as it slides toward a very literal <em>1984</em>, the deterioration has sped up dramatically. Saddest of all, it is occurring with the <em>approval</em> of the now-complacent frogs.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the US is alone in its deterioration towards a totalitarian state. The countries of the EU and many others of the former “Free World” are also in decline. However, the US does lead the way in its Orwellian surveillance. At this point, the US government does not even deny its surveillance. In Orwellian tradition, they merely state, “If you have nothing to hide, you need not fear your government.” And just as in <em>1984</em>, that<em>fear</em> is exactly the object. People who live in fear are easily controlled. They stay put and take whatever is dished up.</p>
<p>As Thomas Jefferson observed,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When the government fears the people, that is liberty; when the people fear the government, that is tyranny.”</em></p></blockquote>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Obama-LIAR-IN-CHIEF-Poster3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Obama-LIAR-IN-CHIEF-Poster2.jpg" align="left" /></a>I could barely make out Barack Obama’s Syria speech to the nation on my old car radio as I negotiated the narrow curves of Route 79 on the western banks of the Mississippi River in central Missouri last Tuesday night. What I could hear sounded very much like more of Obama’s by now standard if stunning arch-mendacity.</p>
<p><b>“To Take This Debate to Congress”</b></p>
<p>Looking at the speech transcript and video online[1] recently, my suspicions were richly confirmed. Speaking from the end of the same long red carpet where George W. Bush delivered his demented announcement of the invasion of Iraq, Obama claimed that he has turned to Congress for authorization to use force against Syria because “I’m…the President of the world’s oldest constitutional democracy” and “believe[s]…it [is] right, in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security, to take this debate to Congress.”</p>
<p>That is certainly a lie. He did no such thing in the case of Libya, subjected to a five-week U.S. bombing campaign (though it posed no “direct or imminent threat to [Americans’] security”) because he didn’t have to, politically. This time it’s different, as the liberalMiddle East historian Juan Cole has explained: “Obama did not need Congress in the case of Libya. He had the Arab League, the UN Security Council, and NATO…But [he has] became more and more isolated [on Syria]. The Arab League declined to call for intervention&#8230; Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and other Arab countries forthrightly denounced the idea of foreign military intervention in Syria, a very different stance than many of them took in 2011 with regard to Libya…Then NATO declined to get involved, with Poland, Belgium, and others expressing reluctance…Then the British Parliament followed suit.” Failure to garner any meaningful fig leaf of formal international support is why Obama ran to Congress this time.</p>
<p><b>“I Possess the Authority”</b></p>
<p>Obama claimed he has gone to Congress “even though I possess the authority to order military strikes.” The former “liberal” constitutional law professor with a degree from Harvard Law certainly knows that the U.S. Constitution grants war-making authority in Congress alone. He should know further that it is thoroughly criminal under international law for him to attack any sovereign nation in the absence of any direct or imminent threat to the U.S.</p>
<p><b>Claims of Humanitarian Concern</b></p>
<p>Obama’s claim to be moved to act by civilian deaths in Syria, citing the horrors of “children writhing in pain, and going still on a cold hospital floor.” This claim is contradicted by the grim determination with which he has regularly murdered innocent civilians (including large numbers of women and children) in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, and elsewhere – “collateral damage” in the dirty global war on/of terror he inherited from Cheney-Bush and then expanded. One horrific example – neither the first nor the last among many – occurred in the May of 2009. That’s when U.S. air-strikes killed 140 civilians in Bola Boluk, a village in western Afghanistan’s Farah Province. Ninety-three of the dead villagers torn apart by U.S. explosives were children. Just 22 were males 18 years or older. Villagers brought tractor trailers full of the pieces of human bodies to the provincial governor’s office to prove that the casualties had occurred. “Everyone at the governor’s office was crying, watching that shocking scene,” one observer reported.”[2]</p>
<p>The initial response of the Obama administration and Pentagon to this appalling incident (one of many mass civilian-butchering U.S. aerial killings in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other parts of the Muslim world under Obama) was to absurdly blame the civilian deaths on “Taliban grenades.” Obama’s Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed “regret” about the loss of innocent life, but the administration refused to issue an apology or acknowledge U.S. responsibility for the blasting apart of civilian bodies in Farah Province.[3]</p>
<p>The matter was quickly dropped and forgotten, sent down George Orwell’s memory hole, with deep media complicity, as the Pentagon wrote checks to the Afghan government to give families a couple thousand dollars per corpse. The U.S. subsequently conducted a dubious “investigation” that reduced the civilian body count drastically and blamed the Taliban for putting civilians in the way of U.S. bombs.[4]</p>
<p>There have been many crimes like Bola Boluk under Obama. People who command glass houses of a sociopathic, mass-murderous empire should not expect to be taken seriously when throw “humanitarian” stones at other butchers.</p>
<p>If Obama is so dismayed by the spectacle of a government “killing its own people,” why is he not calling for missile strikes against the military dictatorship in Egypt, which recently slaughtered hundreds if not thousands of civilians to stop popular protests against the regime? Is it okay to kill your own civilians as long as you are a U.S.-allied regime and/or do the killing with “conventional” weapons?</p>
<p>But why does Obama think we should believe that he can advance humanitarian goals by lobbying cruise missiles at anyone? Two days after Obama’s speech, the<i> New York Times</i> published an Opinion-Editorial from Russian president Vladimir Putin. “The potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the pope, will result in more innocent victims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria’s borders,” Putin reasonably observed. “A strike would increase violence and unleash a new wave of terrorism. It could undermine multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear problem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and further destabilize the Middle East and North Africa. It could throw the entire system of international law and order out of balance.”[5]</p>
<p><b>Selective History and Terrible Weapons</b></p>
<p>In his discussion of the past horrors of chemical weapons (by European powers during World War I and by the Nazi holocaust) last Tuesday night, Obama deleted the United States’ vicious deployment of dioxin during the Vietnam War. That example of chemical warfare caused an explosion of birth defects among other terrible results in Southeast Asia. The president also failed to mention that Washington helped Saddam Hussein use nerve gas against Iranian soldiers and the U.S. Marines used white phosphorous in their massive assaults on the civilian population of Fallujah, Iraq in November of 2004.</p>
<p>Will Obama threaten Tel Aviv with cruise missiles for using white phosphorous against Palestinian civilians in Gaza? Of course not: the Palestinians are officially unworthy victims, like the East Timorese and countless others who have been killed and tortured by governments that are allied with the inherently good United States and therefore officially incapable (like the U.S.) of crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Obama painted out Syria as a rogue state because it has not signed a treaty against chemical weapons like “189 governments that represent 98 percent of humanity.” He did not mention that Syria’s neighbors Syria and Egypt (both U.S. allies) have also not signed the treaty.</p>
<p>Obama had nothing to say, of course, about the even greater dreadfulness of nuclear and radioactive ordnance. The U.S. stands alone in having incinerated and poisoned civilians with atomic weapons – quite unnecessarily in August of 1945. And thanks to America’s deployment of depleted uranium in Iraq, the toxic legacy of the U.S. attacks on Fallujah was worse was that of the atom-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. An epidemic of cancer, leukemia, and birth defects quickly followed in Fallujah.[5A]</p>
<p><b>“We Know the Assad Regime was Responsible”</b></p>
<p>“We know,” Obama said, “the Assad regime was responsible” for the Syrian chemical weapons attack of August 21, 2013. Not so. The proof offered by the president, a former lawyer, was hardly impressive. It contained nothing remotely like a smoking gun. Obama made no attempt to disprove other theories of what might have happened, including some German journalists’ finding that the attack was conducted by a rogue Syrian officer acting without Assad’s approval. Nor did he address what left commentator Glen Ford rightly calls “credible reports (everybody’s reports are more credible than the Americans) that rebels under U.S. allied control were told to prepare to go on the offensive following an American retaliation to chemical attack that would be blamed on Assad’s forces.”[6]</p>
<p>“No one doubts that poison gas was used in Syria,” Putin wrote in his <i>Times</i> editorial: “But there is every reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with [Islamic] fundamentalists.” That is a reasonable judgment.</p>
<p>Nobody should doubt the monstrosity of the Assad regime, but Obama’s proof of Assad’s culpability for the attack in questions amounts pretty much to this: “because I say so.”</p>
<p><b>“These Things Happened:” The Memory Hole</b></p>
<p>“When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory,” Obama said. “But these things happened. The facts cannot be denied.”</p>
<p>An interesting thing to hear from an American president! “From the end of World War Two through the present, the U.S. Empire has caused &#8220;the extinction and suffering of countless human beings. The United States,&#8221; William Blum Pilger noted eight years ago, &#8220;attempted to overthrow fifty governments, many of them democracies, and to crush thirty popular movements fighting tyrannical regimes. In the process, twenty-five countries were bombed, causing the loss of several million lives and the despair of millions more.&#8221;[7]</p>
<p>The leading American imperial crimes include a massive U.S. assault on the peasant nation of Vietnam – an epic attack that killed 3 million Indochinese – and the illegal invasion of oil-rich Mesopotamia, whose terrible human consequences (including at least 2 million Iraqis dying prematurely) remain essentially unmentionable in “mainstream” (dominant) U.S. media. Chemical weapons were deployed in both of these grand imperial transgressions.</p>
<p>Over these decades, the U.S. has been what Noam Chomsky calls “ a rogue state, the leading rogue state, radically violating international law, refusing to accept international convention” and even maintaining “self-authorization to commit genocide.”[8]</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that, as Putin noted in the <i>Times</i>, “Millions around the world …see America <i>not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force</i>, cobbling coalitions together under the slogan ‘you’re either with us or against us’” (emphasis added).</p>
<p><i>“The Anchor of Global Security”</i></p>
<p>There should be little surprise that knowledgeable observers the world over cringe and/or roll their eyes when U.S. presidents say things like this, from Obama’s Tuesday night address:”My fellow Americans, <i>for nearly seven decades, the United States has been the anchor of global security…The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world is a better place because we have borne them</i>” (emphasis added).</p>
<p>That is a blatant lie, as Obama surely knows. Tell it to the survivors of the millions who have been snuffed out by rogue state America, consistently identified by the global populace for many years as the leading threat to peace and security in the world. Tell it to the people of Chile. Two days ago they commemorated the 40th anniversary of their 9/11 – the September 11, 1973 coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of socialist president Salvador Allende. The coup was assisted and supported by Washington, determined to install a vicious military dictatorship that executed thousands of leftists and others and became a leading center of international terror. The U.S. would not permit the continued existence of democratic socialist government in “our hemisphere.”</p>
<p>What would Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., say about Obama’s claim that the U.S. has been “the anchor of global security” since World War II? In 1967, well within the timeframe of Obama’s sweeping historical claim, King identified the U.S. as “the leading purveyor of violence in the world today.” The Vietnamese, King said, “must see Americans as strange liberators” as they “languish under our bombs….as we he herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps. They know they must move or be destroyed by bombs. They watch as we poison their water, as we kill a million acres of their crops [with chemical weapons]. They must weep as the bulldozers roar through their areas preparing to destroy the precious trees. They wander into the hospitals, with at least twenty casualties from American firepower for one ‘Vietcong’-inflicted injury. So far we may have killed a million of them – mostly children…” [9]</p>
<p>Looking at the historical literature on the Cuban Missile Crisis and subsequent moment of supreme nuclear danger, a living King (who would be 84 today had he not been assassinated or perhaps executed inside “the anchor of global security” exactly one year to the day after publicly declaring his opposition to the Vietnam War at the Riverside Church in New York City) today might also like to mention (among other things) the remarkable degree to which the Ahabs of Washington have been willing to risk global thermonuclear war (very barely averted in October 1962) in their quest for unchallenged global supremacy.[10]</p>
<p><i>“It Never Happened”</i></p>
<p>But in the U.S, and indeed across much of the West, the record of ongoing, mass-murderous American criminality is airbrushed out of the official history and mass culture. It is tossed down Orwell&#8217;s memory hole, consistent with Big Brother&#8217;s dictum in <i>Nineteen Eighty Four</i>: &#8220;Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.&#8221; As Harold Pinter noted in his biting acceptance of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature, the reigning Western cultural authorities behave as if U.S. crimes simply did not occur. When it comes to America&#8217;s transgression against civilized norms and international law, &#8220;nothing ever happened. Even while it was happening,&#8221; Pinter added, &#8220;it never happened. It didn&#8217;t matter. It was of no interest.”[11] Dominant U.S.-led Western cultural codes mandate that the only victims meriting acknowledgement and compassion are those assaulted by officially designated enemies. The larger number victimized by the U.S. and its clients and allies (e.g., the Palestinians suffering under Israeli occupation and apartheid) do not qualify for sympathy or even existence. They don&#8217;t exist. The crimes against them didn’t take place.</p>
<p><b>Detour and Lost Cool</b></p>
<p>Eleven minutes into his war speech, Obama had to strangely shift gears and acknowledge the need to delay his hoped-for war vote in light of Russia and Syria’s last-minute proposal to demolish Syria’s chemical weapons under international supervision and control. He tried to save militaristic face by attributing the Russian and Syrian move to his threatened use of force. He seemed to expect his listeners to preposterously believe that a peaceful, diplomatic, and international solution is his idea.  Obama wants us to think that the United Nations route was his preferred path all along.</p>
<p>That’s nonsense. Obama is an aggressive commander of a rogue military state that prefers force and unilateral action in the names of unimpeded hegemony and “American exceptionalism.” He and many of his fellow fake-humanitarian cruise missile liberal imperialists have been itching for a bigger war in the Middle East, one that will let him attack the great regional enemy Iran and wrap the remainder of his lame-duck presidency in the splendor of war-fed patriotism.</p>
<p>Like the British Parliament’s vote against attacking Syria, Putin and Assad’s peace gambit is a great humiliation for Obama. It knocked more stuffing out of his failing fake-humanitarian effort to rally a reluctant, war-weary citizenry plagued by massive domestic problems (including remarkably durable “homeland” poverty and unemployment alongside stunning, New Gilded Age levels of inequality that have only increased under Obama’s supposedly progressive presidency) behind another expensive imperial campaign.</p>
<p>Expect the defeated president to do his best to get the nation back on a unilateral war footing. For now, he has been defeated not simply by other politicians but also by public opinion – by the citizenry in whose name he claims to speak. Imagine that. Along the way, Barack “The Empire’s New Clothes” Obama may well have lost his public cool, the swagger in his step, once and for all. Syria may prove his undoing –the moment when the outwardly nice and smooth-talking “leader” is most clearly revealed for what he really is: a cold-blooded sociopath and pathological liar. That’s long overdue, but its better late than never.</p>

			<p><strong>American Bombing Still Likely&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Qasioun3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Qasioun2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Damascus &#8211; At the height of the war scare here in early September, a group 9 primarily Sunni, Christian, and Alawite students and activists, led by a charismatic and agnostic pro-Hezbollah Lebanese Shia woman from Hermel in Lebanon’s North Bekaa Valley, set up a Human Shields and Observers camp to protect the Syrian TV channels, radio and communication towers situated at the crest of Mount Qasioun which rises up 1,151 meters (3,776 ft) at its crest. The small community has the air of a sit-in as well as a teach-in. Within a few days, their numbers exceeded 200, and at weeks end the “Ala agsadona” (“over our dead bodies”), website was hosting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/on.our.dead.bodies?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_blank">thousands of visitors</a> every day.</p>
<p>“We are prepared to take the first cruise missile with our bare chests,” explained one young man, an architecture student at Syrian University, a relatively expensive private institution which offers majors in French, English, German, Italian and other western languages.</p>
<p>Mount Qasioun, transliterated from Jabal Qāsiyūn, is the high mountain that overlooks Damascus from the north, and many assume its communication towers would be among the first targets of American cruise missiles. Normally a popular tourist spot for hiking and rock climbing, the area is cherished by Syrians as a place of beauty and peace, where one can get away from life’s pressures and enjoy the mountain’s cool temperatures. Here one may also dine at a range of glass-fronted restaurants from which the whole city may be viewed in panorama—and as Damascus has expanded over the years, some districts have even been established on the foot of the mountain. Perhaps as a sign of the times, these days Qaisoun is also honeycombed with Syrian armed forces.</p>
<p>The special connection of Mount Qasioun and the people of Syria is perpetuated by oral and written histories signifying what the Mountain has meant to this region since prehistory. On the slopes of Jabal Qasiun, just above the “Ala agsadona” camp, is a cave, which, it is said, the first man, Adam, inhabited for a period. Historians have recorded a variety of stories about Ibrāhīm (Abraham), and ‘Īsā (Jesus) also having sheltered and prayed in it. Medieval Arab history books speak additionally of it as the site where Qābīl (Cain) killed Hābīl (Abel). Moreover, it has been known for hundreds of years as a place where prayers would immediately be accepted by God, and in Syrian history when a calamity threatened the people, and especially in times of drought, rulers of Damascus would climb to the cave and pray for safety and often for rainfall.</p>
<p>During these days of slaughter and the threats of US-led western bombing, the camp has come to symbolize Syrian resistance to foreign hegemony and occupation.</p>
<p>Sitting below “Adams cave,” not far from the camp, this observer listened as some of these students and activists, many of whom have taken to sleeping on foam mattresses in or alongside tents, explained for me their involvement in the Human Shield project and their objectives. One is Alaa, a United States social history buff, who, to my great enjoyment, sang a resistance song she is writing, asking me my opinion. The song is adapted from the Afro-American spiritual classic, written by John Wesley Work, Jr. in the mid-19th century, with just a few changes to the lyrics:</p>
<p><i>“Go Tell It on the Mountain, From the Peaks of Qasioun and Everywhere;</i></p>
<p><i>Go Shout It out from Adam’s Cave– Where Syria’s Blessed Resistance Was Born!”</i></p>
<p>Some of the most active and inspirational youngsters up at “Ala agsadona” camp are in their “adolescent” 60’s and 70’s. Many of them have lost loved ones during this God-awful continuing crisis. The camp is on high alert 24/7 given the threats against its dwellers from foreigner jihadist groups—given also that the mountain was targeted by mortars, as well as bombed by Israel, last spring. Several army check points minutely screen all traffic heading up its slopes. But despite the various threats, the attitude and general esprit inside “Ala agsadona” is one of resistance, pride and patriotism, not exclusively for the current regime, but intensely focused on Syria—its ten thousand-year history as the cradle of civilization and culture, as well as its centuries as the region’s superpower.</p>
<p>Ogarit Dandask, whose idea it was to establish the camp, explained: “We will protect our land with our bodies, for we prefer dying in dignity than living under any occupation. We call on all the Syrians to join us, because it’s our country that is being threatened, not the regime or any specific person.”</p>
<p>After hearing of preparations for large numbers of Americans and other foreigners to come to Syria to serve as human shields and international observers in solidarity with the Syrian people, Ms. Dandask made an appeal to “all the free people in the world, all those who believe that people have the right to decide their own future,” to join this grass roots campaign. Many Syrians have offered to open their homes to foreign supporters of Syria, who likely would be camped at key potential bombing sites.</p>
<p>Asked if the current pause in Obama Administration bombing plans would lead them to break camp, the response has been that the participants will remain vigilant, prepared to resume their full numbers, and to man their posts should the threats of immediate bombing re-surface. A majority of the Quisoun “minute-men and women”, reflecting the Syrian population’s general view, believe that the current pause is just that. And that American bombing is still likely.</p>
<p>Yet as appears to be the case across Syria, there is a palpable sense of relief, even some limited euphoria at the moment, along with hope and optimism, that the United Nations, Russia, Iran, the USA, and Syria can settle this crisis that has destroyed such a great part of Syria and brought widespread death and destruction to so very many of her families.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Obama-As-Mussolini3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Obama-As-Mussolini2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>There’s the old saying that if the government fears the people, there is liberty, but if the people fear the government there is tyranny. The criminals in Washington not only do not fear us, they do not respect us. Washington looks upon Americans as stupid sheeple.</p>
<p>Washington believes that it can tell the population anything and the people will believe it. For example, the official line is that the recession that began in December 2007 ended in June 2009. Many Americans believe this even thought they have not personally experienced economic recovery. Indeed, they are sinking further into poverty and near poverty.</p>
<p>And don’t forget those nonexistent weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein was alleged by Washington to possess. Or the Gulf of Tonkin fake event when Washington claimed that its warship was attacked by North Vietnam. Really, the list of official lies is very long. Anyone who believes anything that Washington says is too naive to be let out of the house alone. But Americans believe the lies, because that is what they think patriotism requires.</p>
<p>Relying on the proven gullibility of the bulk of the US population, Washington claims to have uncovered an al Qaeda plot to attack US embassies across North Africa and the Middle East. To foil the plot, Washington closed 19 embassies for the past week-end and for this week also.</p>
<p>Washington has not explained how closing the embassies foils the plot. If al Qaeda wants to blow up the embassies, it can blow them up whether they are open or closed.</p>
<p>If al Qaeda wants to kill the embassy personnel, they can kill them at home or on the way to work or later in the embassies when the alert passes.</p>
<p>I only check in with the presstitute media in order to ascertain whether my current estimate of their prostitution for Washington is accurate. Possibly I missed some expression of skepticism about the latest terrorist threat. But I did hear NPR’s account. Back in the Reagan years, NPR was an independent voice. Today it is part of the presstitute media. NPR lies for Washington with the best of them.</p>
<p>The US media has ignored the obvious fact that as soon as the American population, Congress, and Washington’s puppet allies, such as Germany, made an issue over the NSA’s clearly unconstitutional and totally illegal universal spying, the Obama regime pushed the Fear Button and hyped a new terror plot in order to shut up critics and bring Congress and Germany back in line.</p>
<p>Washington proclaimed that a “threat” was discovered that al Qaeda&#8211;an organization that Washington is using in Washington’s effort to overthrow the Assad government in Syria and one that is enriched by US military contracts to affiliated groups in Afghanistan&#8211;was going to blow up US embassies in the Middle East and North Africa. Washington did not explain why al Qaeda, a recipient of Washington’s largess, was going to turn off the money spigot by attacking US embassies.</p>
<p>I am surprised that bombs haven’t been set off in the embassies in order to prove the value of the National Stasi Agency’s spying, thereby shaming those in Congress and among the puppet states in Europe who object to the spying.</p>
<p>Once you give a moment’s thought to Washington’s claim, you see that Washington is proving its impotence by hyping such non-existent threats. Officially, the US has been at war with al Qaeda since October 7, 2001. The “superpower” has been battling a few thousand lightly armed al Qaeda for almost 12 years, and what is the result?</p>
<p>Despite Washington’s claims to have killed al Qaeda’s top leaders, including Osama bin Laden himself, Washington has lost the war. Al Qaeda has grown so powerful that it not only fights in Syria, with Washington’s help, against Assad, but also has prevented the US military from occupying Afghanistan. Moreover, in addition to al Qaeda’s military success against the “superpower” and the chaos that al Qaeda continues to produce in Iraq, al Qaeda now is so powerful that it can shut down US embassies all across the Middle East and North Africa. The “threat” which was supposed to boost the NSA’s position actually proves Washington’s powerlessness.</p>
<p>We an only pray that soon al Qaeda shuts down Washington itself. Imagine the sense of American liberation if Washington simply was shut down, or even better if Washington could be put under Punjab’s magic blanket and disappeared. For the 99 percent, and the rest of the world, Washington is nothing but an oppressor.</p>
