<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Culprits Include The City Of Chicago, Big Retailers, The Media, And Churches&#8230;</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Proponents of the Nanny State have been trying to take away man’s Natural right of self-defense ever since the United Nations was created back in 1945. Of course, the Natural right of self-defense is totally unknown in communist and socialist countries; and big-government toadies in several so-called “democratic” countries have also succeeded in turning citizens into subjects by removing or severely restricting the Natural right of self-defense. Obviously, I’m talking about countries such as Great Britain, France, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By self-defense, I am talking about a man’s right to carry a Personal Defense Weapon (PDW)&#8211;which, in modern times, mostly requires a firearm&#8211;anywhere and everywhere he goes. A state that does not allow a man to be personally armed in his day-to-day activities is literally stripping him of his right of self-defense. To require a citizen to keep his or her PDW in their home or vehicle is to deny the citizen’s Natural right of self-defense. To say a citizen may lawfully protect himself in only limited and duly-prescribed locations is to make the citizen a subject of the state. Furthermore, it removes from him the most fundamental of all the Natural rights that were granted to him by his Creator: the right of self-defense.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Four-legged predators are constantly on the prowl for animals that are defenseless. Two-legged predators do the same thing. These human predators do not respect “gun-free” zones. Like all predators, they are opportunistic beasts. They prey on the weak and vulnerable. When the state takes away a person’s right to be always armed, it makes the entire citizenry weak and vulnerable. As I have said many times, guns don’t kill people; gun-free zones kill people.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Gun control laws are among the most egregious violations of Natural Law. Men and women who are truly free are allowed to carry a PDW everywhere they go. Banks, schools, government buildings, churches, etc., should be no exceptions. It is no coincidence that just about every single mass-shooting in recent memory has taken place in a so-called “gun-free” zone, where the only people who were armed were the perpetrators. Gun-free zones turn free men into human prey.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For all intents and purposes, several states and major cities within the United States have become “gun-free” zones, in that they mostly deny their citizens the right to carry a PDW on their person. Whether the people of these cities and states realize it or not, they have lost the right to be called free men and have been turned into human prey by their own State and municipal governments. There is no greater example of this tyranny than the city of Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Chicago has some of the strictest and most stringent gun-control laws in the entire nation. The government of Chicago has, in effect, turned the town into a giant killing-field where ravenous two-legged beasts are allowed to feast on the millions of defenseless prey that inhabit our country’s third largest city. For example, over the past Independence Day weekend, 82 people were shot and 14 people were killed in Chicago violence. Breitbart.com covered the story:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Breitbart reported that the violence was high on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning, but when Thursday, the final hours of Sunday, and the first few hours of Monday morning were added to the accounting, the rate of violence proved to be even more appalling.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“On Monday morning, July 7, the Chicago Tribune shocked the city with the list of weekend violence reporting that between Thursday, as the holiday weekend began, to the early hours of Monday morning, Chicago experienced 82 shootings with 14 killed.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Included in the Breitbart report is the fact that one man’s life was actually saved by virtue of the fact that he had a concealed carry permit (no small feat in the City of Chicago) and used his PDW to protect himself against three violent miscreants. In this case, one of the dead was a violent predator. Had the innocent citizen not been armed, he would have been the statistic. In addition, the report states that eight of the dead were at the hands of Chicago police officers in the line of duty, proving, once again, that policemen carry guns, not for the protection of the citizenry, but for their own protection.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Predictably, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel blamed the increased violence on “weak” gun laws in the neighboring states of Indiana and Wisconsin.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the Breitbart.com report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Government%2F2014%2F07%2F07%2FBetween-Thursday-and-Sunday-82-shot-and-14-Killed-in-Chicago-Violence&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbYRQWw327UOpyIrUcdH-hESHBLA" target="_blank">Between Thursday And Monday 82 Shot, 14 Killed In Chicago Violence</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, what Emanuel won’t tell you is that the violent crime rates of those states where the right to keep AND BEAR arms is less infringed are far less&#8211;far less! For example, there are 11 states in the country that allow their citizens to carry firearms freely and openly with no permit or license required. Those states are Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota, Vermont, Kentucky, and Virginia. So, using Emanuel’s logic, one could expect that there should have been hundreds of shootings in those states last weekend&#8211;what with their “weak” gun laws and all, right? You know that’s not true.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Check the incidents of shootings in the above-listed states and we might even discover that the City of Chicago may have had more shootings over this past Independence Day weekend than those 11 states COMBINED. Think of it: the City of Chicago (with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country) may have had more shootings than the combined shootings of the 11 states that recognize their citizens’ Natural right of self-defense by allowing them to freely and openly carry a PDW.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, it’s not only various and sundry governments (though they are the most egregious usurpers of the Natural right of self-defense) that want to deny people the right to bear arms; many large retailers are adding their weight to the anti-self-defense hysteria.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Just a few days ago, the giant retailer, Target, announced a corporate policy that asks its patrons to leave their firearms at home. Once again, Breitbart.com covers the story.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“On July 2nd, Target ‘respectfully’ asked law-abiding citizens to ‘not bring firearms’ in their stores.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The department store chain did this via an announcement posted on its website and shared by interim CEO John Mulligan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The announcement says:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘As you&#8217;ve likely seen in the media, there&#8217;s been a debate about whether guests in communities that permit &#8220;open carry&#8221; should be allowed to bring firearms into Target stores. Our approach has always been to follow local laws, and of course, we will continue to do so. But starting today we will respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target&#8211;even in communities where it is permitted by law.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“By taking this step, Target joins Chipotle, Jack in the Box, Sonic, and Chili&#8217;s in asking law-abiding citizens not to carry guns in their businesses.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The author of the report, AWR Hawkins, notes, “Within two weeks of asking law-abiding customers to come unarmed, two Jack in the Box stores were robbed, and a shooting took place at a third. Patrons were robbed at gunpoint in one of the robberies, as well.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report at:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Government%2F2014%2F07%2F02%2FTarget-Respectfully-Asks-Law-Abiding-Citizens-To-Leave-Guns-At-Home&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgCaOXlkzBuCjOparrSfzdp7f3Wg" target="_blank">Target ‘Respectfully’ Asks Law-Abiding Citizens To Leave Guns At Home</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But the war against your Natural right to self-defense doesn’t stop with the City of Chicago or the Target chain-stores. The mainstream media seem absolutely determined to take away your right to defend yourself and your loved ones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">After CNN sacked Piers Morgan due to his immense unpopularity, which was mostly due to his arrogant attacks against America’s Second Amendment, the cable network recently announced that it was replacing Morgan with former America’s Most Wanted host, John Walsh, who immediately proclaimed that his show would continue Morgan’s attacks against the Second Amendment.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once more, Breitbart.com covers the story:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Former America&#8217;s Most Wanted host John Walsh is hosting a new show on CNN on which he vows to keep the push for gun control and the war on the NRA alive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“According to The Wrap, Walsh said:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘I&#8217;m the father of a murdered child. I&#8217;ve done nothing but track violence in America since my son was murdered. We have a serious problem with guns in this country&#8230; and the NRA solution to arm every grammar-school 80-year-old teacher with a gun is absolutely ludicrous.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“He claims the NRA has gotten so big and financially powerful through relationships with gun manufacturers that ‘they&#8217;re not a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, they&#8217;re a gun manufacturer rep.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Walsh&#8217;s new show, The Hunt, premieres July 13. Walsh says he did not initially realize ‘how much his gun control efforts would be a part of his new show.’”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report at:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Journalism%2F2014%2F07%2F07%2FNew-CNN-Host-John-Walsh-Vows-To-Continue-Piers-Morgan-s-War-On-The-NRA&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwfmG2vLNr1MOFV5FaffJTRQma1Q" target="_blank">New CNN Host John Walsh Vows To Continue Piers Morgan’s War On The NRA</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Obviously, CNN is hoping that it’s continued anti-Second Amendment agenda will be more palatable to the American people if it comes from a fellow American&#8211;especially one with whom everyone can truly sympathize with by virtue of his losing a child to an act of violence (although Adam Walsh’s murder did not involve the use of a firearm)&#8211;than from the arrogant and pompous British elitist, Piers Morgan. But make no mistake about it: the anti-Second Amendment message is the same. Only the messenger has changed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And most sadly, churches, too, are often at the forefront of the anti-self-defense fanaticism. Christian leaders from denominations across the board are often the ones who promote gun control (even gun confiscation) among their congregations and who deny their parishioners the right to be armed on church property.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, back in 2004, the president of the LDS church issued a declaration to all Mormon churches in Utah that gave “public notice that firearms are prohibited in the church’s houses of worship, including temples, meetinghouses, the Assembly Hall, the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and the Conference Center.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The declaration went on to say, “Once such public notice is given, persons who bring firearms into a church house of worship should be informed of the church’s position and politely asked to take their firearms to another safe location. Persons who refuse to take their firearms from the house of worship or repeatedly ignore the church’s prohibition should be referred to local law enforcement officers for possible criminal prosecution.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the church statement here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deseretnews.com%2Farticle%2F590038317%2FText-of-letter-from-First-Presidency-on-guns.html%3Fpg%3Dall&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHuqhHjI2590O9spLI-XV5JN1DZyg" target="_blank">Text Of Letter From First Presidency On Guns</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But if you think the LDS church is the only church in the country that has taken such a position, you are sadly misinformed. My educated guess is that the vast majority of denominations and churches in America have a very similar position.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But instead of denying the Christian people of America from exercising their God-given right of self-defense on church property, church leaders should be boldly teaching the Biblical Natural Law principles of self-defense and encouraging their people to jealously guard this most fundamental liberty. By demanding that Christian people not be armed on church property, church leaders are no better than Rahm Emanuel&#8211;who insists that Chicago’s residents not be allowed to protect themselves&#8211;and are opening up their churches to those two-legged wolves who would seek to devour the sheep.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There are only a small handful of countries today that recognize the Natural right of self-defense. The advent of the United Nations has facilitated the demise of this right in country after country. The United States is the last major power that yet somewhat protects this most precious Natural right.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Obviously, several State and local governments within the United States (not to mention the worst offender of all: the federal government in Washington, D.C.) have themselves assisted the dismantlement of the right of self-defense. Several giant retailers are assisting the attacks against our Natural right of self-defense. The mainstream media is incessant in its attacks against the Second Amendment. And even many of America’s churches have set themselves against the right to BEAR arms. The war against our Natural right of self-defense continues.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, I need to point out that the architects of the Nanny State have been trying to disarm the American people since even before the United Nations was created. And while the right to keep and bear arms has been severely restricted by myriads of federal, State, and local laws, the American people continue to be the most heavily armed people in the world. Not only is the American citizenry an armed citizenry, it is an absolutely determined citizenry. The message to any and all potential tyrants who would attempt to remove our Natural right of self-defense is the same&#8211;whether they are from King George’s London, Mao’s Beijing, Stalin’s Moscow, Emanuel’s Chicago, Obama’s Washington, D.C., or the U.N.’s New York City: MOLON LABE, COME AND TAKE THEM!</p>

<p>Sometimes I just want to pimp slap people.</p>
<p>Last summer, I was at dinner during a sales convention. The conversation didn’t get political until someone mentioned the NSA.</p>
<p>There is one in every crowd. Someone piped up and said, “They can spy on me all they want. I am not doing anything wrong.”</p>
<p>They sang this song in Germany in 1933. And they sang it with unprecedented gusto in the months following 9/11, all in the name of  “security” and “keeping us safe”.</p>
<p>We were at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, the world’s second largest hotel. Nothing in the post-9/11 “national security” apparatus would prevent a terrorist from walking in, setting off a bomb, and killing hundreds or even thousands of people.</p>
<p>The more important questions are: How do you know you are doing nothing that could be construed as wrong by some state functionary? How do you know you are not breaking some law somewhere? And why are you so implicitly trusting that your government would never do anything evil with the information it has collected on you?</p>
<p>This is not purely an academic matter. The practical implications are profound.</p>
<p>I give you several examples.</p>
<p>1. Niakea Williams went to her son’s St. Louis-area elementary school one day to pick up her son, who has Asperger’s. The school was put on lockdown and <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Mother-arrested-at-school-for-consoling-son-in-local-classroom-251349481.html">Mrs. Williams was escorted out in handcuffs.</a></p>
<p>2. Adrionna Harris was <a href="http://wavy.com/2014/03/19/student-suspended-for-taking-razor-from-self-harming-classmate/">almost expelled from her middle school</a> in Virginia Beach after taking a razor blade away from a fellow student who was trying to harm himself.</p>
<p>3. Read what <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/17/houston-police-just-assume-guy-giving-ch">Houston police did</a> to this man who gave 75 cents to a homeless person.</p>
<p>4. A little known Denver parking ordinance can get you a $25 fine <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/little-known-parking-ordinance-could-get-you-25-ticket-even-if-you-havent-exceeded-time-limits">even if you haven’t exceeded the two-hour limit.</a></p>
<p>5. Police in Iowa City, Iowa, <a href="http://ij.org/iowa-cops-seize-almost-50-000-from-a-couple-didn-t-charge-them-with-a-crime">seized $50,000</a> from this couple without charging them with a crime.</p>
<p>6. Alberto Willmore lost his teaching job in Manhattan over a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEzZSDKOVM4#t=321">totally bogus marijuana arrest.</a> Even though he was never convicted of anything, he was unable to get his job back.</p>
<p>7. Norman Gurley was arrested in Lorain County, Ohio, because a compartment in his car <a href="http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/2013/11/20/trap-car-law/3655713/">could have been used to transport drugs.</a></p>
<p>8. Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies <a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2014/02/115178-police-shoot-kill-80-year-old-man-bed/">shot and killed 80-year-old Eugene Mallory</a> in his own bed during a meth raid. No meth, or any other illegal drugs, was discovered.</p>
<p>9. Paul Valin contacted police to report that he found a backpack full of what he believed to be meth-making equipment 15 miles from his home near Des Moines. As a result, the DEA placed his house <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/28/mans-good-deed-lands-his-home-on-dea-list-meth-labs/?intcmp=latestnews">on its list of meth labs.</a></p>
<p>10. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Holle">Ryan Holle</a> of Pensacola, Florida, lent his roommate his car on night in 2004. As a result, Holle is currently serving a <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/lending-friend-your-car-can-get-you-life-sentence?page=0%2C0&amp;paging=off&amp;current_page=1#bookmark">life sentence without possibility of parole</a> for pre-meditated murder.</p>
<p>11. New York police seized Gerald Bryan’s cash in a nighttime raid in 2012. <a href="http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/nypd-seized-innocent-mans-cash-used-pad-pensions/#axzz2qOoePUCS">Even though Bryan was cleared of any wrongdoing</a>, the stolen cash was deposited in the NYPD pension fund.</p>
<p>12. Robert Duncan is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/03/robert-duncan-marijuana_n_4877072.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592">currently serving two years in a California prison</a>, even though the business in which he worked was legal in California.</p>
<p>13. Jordan Wiser spent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/jordan-wiser_n_4921266.html?utm_hp_ref=crime">13 days in jail</a> after Jefferson, Ohio, police found a pocketknife during a warrantless search of his car.</p>
<p>14. During a school lockdown in Clarksville, Tennessee, David Duren-Sanner gave police permission to search his car as he had “nothing to hide”. Police found a fishing knife. Duren-Sanner, who previously had never been to the principal’s office, <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/story/24811452/clarksville-student-suspended-for-knife-in-fathers-car">was suspended for 10 days and then sent to an alternative school for 90 days.</a></p>
<p>15. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/12/health/medical-marijuana-parents/index.html?hpt=hp_t3">Look what happened</a> to these parents in Napa, California, even though the medical marijuana prescriptions they had were completely legal.</p>
<p>16. Eileen Ann Bower of suburban Pittsburgh <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/03/17/county-settles-with-mother-who-lost-newborn-after-erroneous-drug-test/">had her newborn child taken from her for 75 days</a> because of a false positive drug test.</p>
<p>17. Jerry Hartfield of Bay City, Texas, has spent the majority of his life in prison, even though his<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-inmate-conviction-overturned-1980-behind-bars-article-1.1761084#ixzz2zY4CTny7">conviction was overturned in 1980</a>.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">According to The Salt Lake Tribune, “It’s time for Western states to take control of federal lands within their borders, lawmakers and county commissioners from Western states said at Utah’s Capitol on Friday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“More than 50 political leaders from nine states convened for the first time to talk about their joint goal: wresting control of oil-,timber-and mineral-rich lands away from the feds.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘It’s simply time,’ said Rep. Ken Ivory, R-West Jordan, who organized the Legislative Summit on the Transfer for Public Lands along with Montana state Sen. Jennifer Fielder. ‘The urgency is now.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Utah House Speaker Becky Lockhart, R-Provo, was flanked by a dozen participants, including her counterparts from Idaho and Montana, during a press conference after the daylong closed-door summit. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee addressed the group over lunch, Ivory said. New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington also were represented.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The summit was in the works before this month’s tense standoff between Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management over cattle grazing, Lockhart said.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘What’s happened in Nevada is really just a symptom of a much larger problem,’ Lockhart said.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sltrib.com%2Fsltrib%2Fpolitics%2F57836973-90%2Futah-lands-lawmakers-federal.html.csp&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpCMp3rdO1K_3HsZXKqIvIH22tpw" target="_blank">Western Lawmakers Gather In Utah To Talk Federal Land Takeover</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now we are getting somewhere!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The western states have been used as both playground and sugar stick for big-government politicians since before most of the western states became states. Compare the percentage of State land owned by the federal government in the western states to that of the eastern states.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here is the percentage of land owned by the federal government in seven eastern states:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Illinois: 1.8%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ohio: 1.7%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Alabama: 1.6%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Maine: 1.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">New York: 0.8%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Rhode Island: 0.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Connecticut: 0.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By contrast, here is the percentage of land owned by the federal government in seven western states:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Wyoming: 42.3%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">California: 45.3%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Arizona: 48.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Idaho: 50.2%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Oregon: 53.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Utah: 57.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Nevada: 84.5%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The situation with the Bundys in Nevada highlights the heavy-handed tactics that the federal government employs against anyone who dares to challenge the manner in which the feds are attempting to kick hard-working, productive citizens off of federal lands. Remember that ranchers and farmers such as Cliven Bundy were promised access to these federal lands in perpetuity back in the nineteenth century when all of these land deals were being negotiated between the states and the federal government. Beyond that, ownership of the land by the federal government was supposed to preserve and protect the land for the people, not for the federal government.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A few years ago, there were dozens of successful and prosperous ranchers in the area around the Bundys. But since the BLM was given legislative mandates when Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) in 1976, Cliven Bundy is now the only rancher in the area still standing.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The BLM has grown into a totalitarian monster.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, the BLM regulates hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, boating, hang gliding, shooting, off-highway vehicle driving, mountain biking, bird watching, and visiting natural and historical sites. The BLM also regulates logging, mining, fracking and other activities. What ranchers such as Cliven Bundy are going through loggers and miners are also experiencing. In fact, it is no hyperbole to say that, for all intents and purposes, the ranching, logging, and mining industries in the western states are being systematically regulated out of existence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And in the case of Cliven Bundy, it is not about saving the Desert Tortoise or grazing fees or anything of the sort. It is all about letting fat-cat politicians such as Harry Reid negotiate lucrative solar energy deals with Communist China. Hey, folks: if the land doesn’t belong to Cliven Bundy, it doesn’t belong to Harry Reid, either!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The BLM’s evil twin sister is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was established in 1970. These two federal agencies have become the Wicked Witch of the East and Wicked Witch of the West in what used to be a beautiful land paved with yellow brick roads.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">I dare say that if the eastern states were enduring the haranguing and harassment that the western states are enduring, the BLM would have been brought under control years ago. Absent national unity from eastern states on the matter, it is time for the western states to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The legislative action being contemplated by the above-mentioned State legislators who assembled in Salt Lake City last Friday is a terrific first step. It is absolutely time for the western states to use their eminent domain authority to reclaim the lands within their borders that are currently owned by Washington, D.C. With the exception of National Parks, states should serve notice that they are taking back the land owned by the federal government&#8211;land that should never have been ceded to the central government to begin with.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The second problem that the siege against Cliven Bundy illustrates is the unconstitutional police powers assumed by federal agencies such as the BLM. Originally, the only federal agency that was lawfully allowed to make arrests on behalf of the U.S. government was the U.S. Marshals Service, which was created back in 1789&#8211;the year that the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Today, there are scores of alphabet agencies of the federal government who carry a badge and a gun and are allowed to enforce law at bayonet point. And the vast majority of these agencies are acting on assumed authority&#8211;authority not granted them constitutionally. Among these, there is no greater culprit than the BLM.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“You don’t send the Seventh Cavalry to collect a bill, and that’s exactly what happened,” Pat Buchanan told Sean Hannity on his radio show last Monday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Buchanan went on to say, “And when they put all those forces out there-that’s what attracted all the others, the history of what happened at Waco, Ruby Ridge. And so these folks came to that rancher’s defense. But the initial problem here is [the] sending of all the force of arms out there to that ranch, which was a provocation to which these folks responded.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtontimes.com%2Fnews%2F2014%2Fapr%2F22%2Fpat-buchanan-sums-nevada-sending-seventh-cavalry-c%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzyHxXC-lxsYy8ZqPoCg0lqT3OGg" target="_blank">Pat Buchanan Sums Up Nevada Ranch Standoff: Sending ‘Seventh Cavalry To Collect A Bill’</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Constitution delegates only three crimes to the federal government: treason, piracy, and counterfeiting. That’s it. No other crimes are mentioned. That means that all other crimes are the purview of the states&#8211;including local and State police, sheriff’s deputies, and citizen militias and posses.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, the problem is the Congress (and Court) in Washington, D.C., has used the “Necessary and Proper Clause” of Article. I. Section. 8. to justify all sorts of federal law enforcement enactments.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The result of this unconstitutional federal expansion of police powers is we now have scores of federal agencies that are using unchecked and unbridled power&#8211;power that is turning the United States into a giant police state.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The states must push back!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Not only must states reclaim millions of acres of land within their borders that are now controlled by the federal government, they must also pass legislation requiring federal bureaucracies such as the BLM to obtain the consent of county sheriffs in order to execute arrest warrants. States must make it clear in unmistakable terms that only the U.S. Marshals Service may execute federal warrants within their states; otherwise, only the county sheriff is authorized to execute arrest warrants within their states.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the U.S. Congress needs to disarm the countless federal bureaucracies that are currently terrorizing the American people. In truth, very few federal agencies need to carry guns. The politicians in Washington, D.C., love to try to disarm the American people, but the ones they should be disarming are most of the federal alphabet agencies.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Why do employees of the federal Department of Education need to carry guns? Why do postal employees need to carry guns? Why do agents of the BLM need to carry guns? Why do employees at NASA need to carry guns? Why do employees of the EPA need to carry guns? Why do employees at NOAA need to carry guns? Why do employees of the National Weather Service need to carry guns? Why do employees of the Social Security Administration need to carry guns? Why do employees at the Department of Agriculture need to carry guns? Why do employees of the National Marine Fisheries Service need to carry guns?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ladies and gentlemen, law enforcement is mostly the responsibility of State and local governments. Why are so many federal bureaucracies carrying guns? Agencies of the federal government are not soldiers; and they are not even policemen. Furthermore, the American people are not the enemy!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Pat Buchanan is right: had not BLM agents marched onto the Bundy ranch like Nazi Stormtroopers, none of the events that are still playing out in the Nevada desert would have taken place. The memory of Waco and Ruby Ridge are still very vivid in the collective memory of the people of the United States. If anything burns deep in our collective conscience, it is that THERE MUST NEVER AGAIN BE ANOTHER WACO OR RUBY RIDGE. And that is exactly why those Americans have put themselves between the federal government and the Bundy family down in Bunkerville, Nevada.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The events in Salt Lake City, Utah, conducted by dozens of legislators from the western states last Friday were as monumental as the events in Bunkerville, Nevada, conducted by the citizen militia the previous Saturday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Free and independent states and “We the People” have always been the guardians of liberty in this land. And if freedom is going to be preserved for our posterity, it is going to take the combined effort of both the individual sovereign states and individual citizens to arise and stand in the gap once again. It would also seem that the rise has already begun. Praise God! The only thing missing now is the patriot pulpit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">P.S. I have been inundated with requests from pastors and laymen alike to help them establish non-501c3, unaffiliated, unorganized, unincorporated churches. I have heard their pleas; and I have a very important announcement regarding this matter coming in the very near future. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>What happens when an institution becomes more important than the cause for which the institution was formed? How long should people who believe in the cause remain loyal to such an institution? And at what point does loyalty to such an institution comprise an abandonment of the cause itself?</p>
<p>I’m afraid the majority of Americans have been institutionalized in a manner not unlike the way prisoners are institutionalized after a long period of confinement. After a point, a prisoner is so conditioned to accepting the circumstances of his confinement that, should he be released from confinement, he truly would be unable to cope. Such seems to be the mentality of a majority of us today.</p>
<p>Christians have been institutionalized. The reason and purpose of the church or Christian organization is no longer relevant. Generations have grown up reciting the same liturgies, regurgitating the same prayers, and rehearsing the same programs until the reason for it all doesn’t even matter. But take the institution away from them, and they would not be able to cope.</p>
<p>The Pharisees despised the Lord Jesus because He challenged the religious institutions that had come to govern people’s lives. I am convinced if Jesus came to America today, He would be just as despised by the vast majority of our religious leaders as He was by the Pharisees.</p>
<p>The Church that Jesus built in the Book of Acts owned no buildings, was indebted to no lenders, took no tax benefits from the civil government, had no denominational hierarchy, and identified itself with no ecclesiastical brand. And the Church was just as persecuted by the religious establishment as Christ was.</p>
<p>One of the reasons one may know that the modern church is so unlike Christ and the apostles is by the persecution that it never experiences. Just as the Pharisees were bosom buddies with the Roman Empire’s governing elite, so are our religious leaders today. Caesar was very generous in sharing the fruit of his tyrannically-extracted bounty with his allies in the Jewish Sanhedrin. And they were happy to return the favor by insisting that the Hebrew people submit to Caesar’s harsh rule over their lives.</p>
<p>The Pharisees also enjoyed a cozy relationship with the moneychangers. The moneychangers were descended from a long line of corrupt banking interests that dated all the way back to the Edomites. We are not talking about your friendly local banker here. These were highly organized, well-positioned money-manipulators. Jesus was so incensed with their manipulation and theft within in the Temple that he used physical violence to remove them from the property. He is recorded as doing this twice in the Gospel narratives. Note that after the second time in which it is recorded that He drove out the moneychangers (with a whip, no less), the Pharisees soon had Jesus crucified. There is no question that one of the reasons Pilate ordered Jesus to be scourged with a whip was in direct retaliation for the manner in which Jesus whipped the moneychangers. Remember, the moneychangers were from a very well-ensconced, elitist national (and even international) organization.</p>
<p>And lest you think all of this is irrelevant to today, the moneychangers are still very much with us. The Rothschilds, Rockefellers, and other members of the international banking elite, are the direct descendants of the moneychangers of Jesus’ day. And if you ever have an opportunity to ask one of them about it, they will proudly admit it.</p>
<p>Yes, the Pharisees institutionalized religion. This accomplished two things: 1) it helped enslave the people, 2) it helped make them rich. The institutionalized church is accomplishing much the same things today.</p>
<p>The establishment church is doing as much to enslave people as any other institution in the world. Our political institutions and educational institutions have nothing on the church for making good little subjects and serfs to the all-powerful state. And if you don’t think that a host of church leaders are not reaping the spoils from assisting our taskmasters, you’re not paying attention.</p>
<p>Many, if not most, of these big-name TV evangelists have as many houses and yachts and Swiss bank accounts as any big-name Hollywood actor or politician. In some cases, more. Most of these big-church pastors are bathing in luxury. Many of them take the kinds of vacations that only CEOs of the biggest corporations or presidents could afford. Do you really think that the IRS rules and regulations governing these non-profit corporations, called churches, really bother these church leaders? Get real!</p>
<p>No wonder all of these “successful” preachers are constantly teaching their congregations to always submit to the government. No wonder they have no interest in abandoning their 501c3 tax-exempt status. They are in the exact same position as were the Pharisees of old. And they are just as effective in helping to enslave people today as were the Pharisees.</p>
<p>The institution of the church&#8211;along with its programs, formalities, buildings, rituals, etc.,&#8211;has become more important than the purpose for which the church was created. Instead of preaching the liberating message of the Cross, which frees men from the fetters of sin&#8211;and that includes sinful political and financial fetters&#8211;the church is preaching a message of subjugation and enslavement. It is teaching people to submit to all kinds of oppression, including religious oppression.</p>
<p>Some of the most oppressed and subjugated people in the world are religious people. There are churches and Christian colleges that are every bit as tyrannical as anything coming out of East-bloc or Muslim countries. About the only thing missing is physical torture and execution. Spiritually, however, the oppression is the same.</p>
<p>How could real men who love the liberty they have in Christ allow themselves&#8211;and especially their wives&#8211;to be told how to dress, how to wear their hair, what kind of music to listen to, what kind of vacations to take, what restaurants they may or may not eat at, what forms of entertainment they may or may not participate in, etc., etc., ad infinitum?</p>
<p>I tell you the truth: many Christians in America are already slaves. To talk to them about freedom is a complete waste of time. The chains of tyranny are already clamped around their hearts. Why should it matter to them if chains are clamped around their necks? When they talk about “defending the faith,” they are talking about defending the institution. They are slaves to the institution. And the same is true for many unchurched Americans.</p>
<p>What is more important: liberty, or the government that is supposed to secure liberty? To a sizeable number of Americans today, it is more important to preserve the institution than the freedoms that the institution was created to protect.</p>
<p>Our Declaration of Independence states, “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends [the God-given rights of life, liberty, etc.], it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”</p>
<p>Did you see that: “any form of government”? ANY FORM. The form of government is only as good as its ability to secure liberty.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of politicians and media personalities talking about “American exceptionalism.” This is a potentially dangerous mindset. If one means that America is exceptional in our history and the manner in which our Constitution and Bill of Rights were established to protect liberty, well and good. But if it means that America has carte-blanche to do anything it wants&#8211;no matter how unconstitutional or tyrannical&#8211;because it is “exceptional,” it is a bunch of hooey.</p>
<p>What difference does it make if we have a 50-State Union or not? There is a bill in the California legislature that would divide that State into six states. Five counties in Western Maryland are trying to secede from Baltimore. Ten northern counties in Colorado are trying to secede from Denver. If a State refuses to secure the liberties of the people of that State, they have every right under God to separate. The State is not nearly as important as the liberties of the people within the State.</p>
<p>The spirit of secession is actually growing like wildfire all over the world. In recent history, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Kosovo all separated from Yugoslavia. Transnistria broke free from Moldova. Abkhazia and South Ossetia fought free from Georgia. The Slovaks seceded from Czechoslovakia. And now Crimea is separating from Ukraine.</p>
<p>To be sure, not every country that secedes from another country is motivated purely by the love of liberty. But for those of us in America, the issue that has propelled the desire to separate from one country or one State has always been liberty. It was the love of liberty that created the United States and that created the free and independent states of Maine, Vermont, Kentucky, and West Virginia&#8211;all of which seceded from existing U.S. states.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what difference does it make if Washington, D.C., is our federal capital, or, if say, Helena, Montana, would become the federal capital of a mountain state confederation of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Northern Colorado, eastern Washington and Oregon, the Dakotas, Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, and Alaska? Or if Austin was the federal capital of an independent Republic of Texas? Preserving some sort of political union (especially if it is a forced and coerced union) is not nearly as important as preserving liberty.</p>
<p>Again, it is not the political institution that is important. What is important is the liberty that the political institution is supposed to secure.</p>
<p>Many great minds in this country are already philosophizing over the possibility that secession is an idea whose time has come&#8211;again. A few years ago, Walter Williams wrote, “Like a marriage that has gone bad, I believe there are enough irreconcilable differences between those who want to control and those want to be left alone that divorce is the only peaceable alternative. Just as in a marriage, where vows are broken, our human rights protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution have been grossly violated by a government instituted to protect them. Americans who are responsible for and support constitutional abrogation have no intention of mending their ways.</p>
<p>“Americans who wish to live free have two options: We can resist, fight and risk bloodshed to force America&#8217;s tyrants to respect our liberties and human rights, or we can seek a peaceful resolution of our irreconcilable differences by separating. That can be done by peopling several states, say Texas and Louisiana, control their legislatures and then issue a unilateral declaration of independence just as the Founders did in 1776. You say, ‘Williams, nobody has to go that far, just get involved in the political process and vote for the right person.’ That&#8217;s nonsense. Liberty shouldn&#8217;t require a vote. It&#8217;s a God-given or natural right.</p>
<p>“Some independence or secessionists movements, such as our 1776 war with England and our 1861 War Between the States, have been violent, but they need not be. In 1905, Norway seceded from Sweden, Panama seceded from Columbia (1903), and West Virginia from Virginia (1863). Nonetheless, violent secession can lead to great friendships. England is probably our greatest ally and we have fought three major wars together. There is no reason why Texiana (Texas and Louisiana) couldn&#8217;t peaceably secede, be an ally, and have strong economic ties with United States.</p>
<p>“The bottom line question for all of us is should we part company or continue trying to forcibly impose our wills on one another?”</p>
<p>See William’s column here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchuckbaldwinlive.com%2FArticles%2Ftabid%2F109%2FID%2F1149%2FInstitutionalized-Tyranny.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1RS7GDjYF35eP0TqKh9wrKVsJJA" target="_blank">It&#8217;s Time To Part Company</a></p>
<p>Hear! Hear!</p>
<p>In the eyes of God, marriage is the most sacred of all unions. It is far more sacred than any political union. If our Creator has authorized the separation of a husband and wife under certain circumstances in which one party violated the sacred terms of the holy contract (and He has), who among us has the audacity to say that political unions may not be abandoned when government commits political adultery by forsaking its oath to the people?</p>
<p>Again, are we more interested in preserving an institution or the liberty that the institution is supposed to secure?</p>
<p>As an institution, the Church at large is apostate. Yet, millions of Christians continue to prop up an institution that has abandoned the purpose for which it was created. They are more interested in preserving the forms and liturgies and tapestries and buildings of the institution. And, all the while, they are being spiritually enslaved by the very institution they are helping to prop up.</p>
<p>And as an institution, the U.S. federal government is apostate. Yet, millions of citizens continue to make excuses for it, justify it, and condone it. They are more interested in preserving the agencies and entities and power of the institution. Yet, all the while, they are being enslaved by the very institution they are helping to prop up.</p>
<p>What happens when an institution becomes more important than the cause for which the institution was formed? When the institution is civil government and the cause is liberty, tyranny is what happens.</p>

</div>
<p>The leaders of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee,  Sen. Tim Johnson (D., S.D.) and Sen. Mike Crapo (R., Idaho),  released a draft bill on Sunday that would provide explicit government guarantees on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) generated by privately-owned banks and financial institutions. The gigantic giveaway to Wall Street would put US taxpayers on the hook for 90 percent of the losses on toxic MBS the likes of which crashed the financial system in 2008 plunging the economy into the deepest slump since the Great Depression. Proponents of the bill say that new rules by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) –which set standards for a “qualified mortgage” (QM)– assure that borrowers will be able to repay their loans thus reducing the chances of a similar meltdown in the future. However, those QE rules were largely shaped by lobbyists and attorneys from the banking industry who eviscerated strict underwriting requirements– like high FICO scores and 20 percent down payments– in order to lend freely to borrowers who may be less able to repay their loans.  Additionally, a particularly lethal clause has been inserted into the bill that would provide blanket coverage for all MBS  (whether they met the CFPB’s QE standard or not) in the event of another financial crisis. Here’s the paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sec.305. Authority to protect taxpayers in unusual and exigent market conditions….</p>
<p>If the Corporation, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, determine that unusual and exigent circumstances threaten mortgage credit availability within the U.S. housing market, FMIC may provide insurance on covered securities that do not meet the requirements under section 302 including those for first loss position of private market holders.” (“Freddie And Fannie Reform – The Monster Has Arrived”, Zero Hedge)</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, if the bill passes,  US taxpayers will be responsible for any and all bailouts deemed necessary by the regulators mentioned above.  And, since all of those regulators are in Wall Street’s hip-pocket, there’s no question what they’ll do when the time comes. They’ll bailout they’re fatcat buddies and dump the losses on John Q. Public.</p>
<p>If you can’t believe what you are reading or if you think that the system is so thoroughly corrupt it can’t be fixed; you’re not alone. This latest outrage just confirms that the Congress, the executive and all the chief regulators are mere marionettes performing whatever task is asked of them by their Wall Street paymasters.</p>
<p>The stated goal of the Johnson-Crapo bill is to “overhaul” mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that “private capital can play the central role in home finance.” (That’s how Barack Obama summed it up.) Of course, that’s not really the purpose at all. The real objective is to hand over the profit-generating mechanism to the private banks (Fannie and Freddie have been raking in the dough for the last three years) while the red ink is passed on to the public. That’s what’s really going on.</p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal,  the bill will</p>
<blockquote><p>“construct an elaborate new platform by which a number of private-sector entities, together with a privately held but federally regulated utility, would replace key roles long played by Fannie and Freddie….”</p>
<p>“The legislation replaces the mortgage-finance giants with a new system in which the government would continue to play a potentially significant role insuring U.S. home loans.” (“Plan for Mortgage Giants Takes Shape”, Wall Street Journal)<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304704504579432961053293826"> </a></p></blockquote>
<p>“Significant role”? What significant role? (Here’s where it gets interesting.)</p>
<p>The WSJ:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Senate bill would repurpose the firms’ existing regulator as a new “Federal Mortgage Insurance Corp.” and charge the agency with approving new firms to pool loans into securities. Those firms could then purchase federal insurance to guarantee payments to investors in those bonds. The FMIC would insure mortgage bonds much the way the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. provides bank-deposit insurance.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Unbelievable. So they want to turn F and F into an insurance company that backs up the garbage mortgages created by the same banks that just ripped us all off for trillions of dollars on the same freaking swindle?</p>
<p>You can’t be serious?</p>
<p>More from the WSJ:  “Mortgage guarantors would be required to maintain a 10% capital buffer against losses and to have that capital extinguished before the federal insurance would be triggered.”</p>
<p><em>10 percent?</em> What the hell difference does 10 percent make; that’s a drop in the bucket.  If the banks are going to issue mortgages to people who can’t repay the debt, then they need to cover the damn losses themselves, otherwise they shouldn’t be in the banking biz to begin with, right?</p>
<p>This is such an outrageous, in-your-face ripoff, it shouldn’t even require a response. These jokers should be laughed out of the senate. All the same,  the bill is moving forward, and President Twoface has thrown his weigh behind it. Is there sort of illicit, under-the-table, villainous activity this man won’t support?</p>
<p>Not when it comes to his big bank buddies, there isn’t. Now check out this clip from an article by economist Dean Baker. Baker refers to the Corker-Warner bill, but the Crapo-Johnson fiasco is roughly the same deal. Here’s Baker:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Corker-Warner bill does much more than just eliminate Fannie and Freddie. In their place, it would establish a system whereby private financial institutions could issue mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that carry a government guarantee. In the event that a large number of mortgages in the MBS went bad, the investors would be on the hook for losses up to 10 percent of its value, after that point the government gets the tab.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If you think that sounds like a reasonable system, then you must not have been around during the housing crash and ensuing financial crisis. At the peak of the crisis in 2008-2009 the worst subprime MBS were selling at 30-40 cents on the dollar. This means the government would have been picking up a large tab under the Corker-Warner system, even if investors had been forced to eat a loss equal to 10 percent of the MBS price.</p>
<p>The pre-crisis financial structure gave banks an enormous incentive to package low quality and even fraudulent mortgages into MBS. The system laid out in the Corker-Warner bill would make these incentives even larger. The biggest difference is that now the banks can tell investors that their MBS come with a government guarantee, so that they most they stand to lose is 10 percent of the purchase price.” (“The disastrous idea for privatizing Fannie and Freddie”, Dean Baker, Al Jazeera)</p></blockquote>
<p>Just ponder that last part for a minute: “The bill would make these incentives even larger.”</p>
<p>Do you really think we should create bigger incentives for these dirtbags to rip us off? Does that make sense to you? Here’s more from Baker:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The changes in financial regulation are also unlikely to provide much protection. In the immediate wake of the crisis there were demands securitizers keep a substantial stake in the mortgages they put into their pools, to ensure that they had an incentive to only securitize good mortgages. Some reformers were demanding as much as a 20 percent stake in every mortgage.</p>
<p>Over the course of the debate on the Dodd-Frank bill and subsequent rules writing this stake got ever smaller. Instead of being 20 percent, it was decided that securitizers only had to keep a 5 percent stake. And for mortgages meeting certain standards they wouldn’t have to keep any stake at all.</p>
<p>Originally only mortgages in which the homeowner had a down payment of 20 percent or more passed this good mortgage standard. That cutoff got lowered to 10 percent and then was lowered further to 5 percent. Even though mortgages with just 5 percent down are four times as likely to default as mortgages with 20 percent or more down, securitizers will not be required to keep any stake in them when they put them into a MBS.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hold on there, Dean. You mean Dodd Frank didn’t ”put things right”?  What the heck? I thought that “tough new regulations” assured us that the banks wouldn’t blow up the system again in five years or so. Was that all baloney?</p>
<p>Yep, sure was. 100% baloney. Once the banks unleashed their army of attorneys and lobbyists on Capital Hill,  new regulations didn’t stand a chance. They turned Dodd Frank into mincemeat and now we’re back to square one.</p>
<p>And don’t expect the ratings agencies to help out either because they’re in the same shape they were before the crash. No changes at all.  They still get paid by the guys who issue the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) which is about the same as if you paid the salary of the guy who grades your midterm exam. Do you think that might cloud his judgment a bit? You’re damn right, it would; just like paying the ratings agencies guarantees you’ll get the rating you want. The whole system sucks.</p>
<p>And as far as the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, well, you guessed it. The banks played a role in drafting the new “Qualified Mortgage” standard too, which is really no standard at all, since no self-respecting lender would ever use the same criteria for issuing a loan or mortgage. For example, no banker is going to say, “Heck, Josh, we don’t need your credit scores. We don’t need a down-payment. We’re all friends here, right? So, how much do you need for that mortgage old buddy, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000.  You name it. The sky’s the limit.”</p>
<p>No down payment? No credit scores? And they have the audacity to call this a qualified mortgage?</p>
<p>Qualified for what? Qualified for sticking it to the taxpayers?  The real purpose of the qualified mortgage is to protect the banks from their own shifty deals. That’s what it’s all about. It provides them with “safe harbor” in the event that the borrower defaults. What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that the government can’t get its money back if the loan blows up.   The qualified mortgage actually protects the banks, not the consumer. That’s why it’s such a farce,  just like Dodd Frank is a farce. Nothing has changed. Nothing. In fact, it’s gotten worse. Now we’re on the hook for whatever losses the banks run up peddling mortgage credit to anyone who can fog a mirror.</p>
<p>We’ll leave the last word for Dean Baker, since he seems like the only guy in America who has figured out what the hell is going on:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In short, the Corker-Warner plan to privatize Fannie and Freddie is essentially a proposal to reinstitute the structure of incentives that gave us the housing bubble and the financial crisis, but this time with the added fuel of an explicit government guarantee on the subprime MBS. If that doesn’t sound like a great idea to you then you haven’t spent enough time around powerful people in Washington.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Johnson-Crapo bill doesn’t have anything to do with “winding down” Fannie and Freddie or “overhauling” the mortgage finance industry. It’s a bald-face ripoff engineered by two chiseling senators who are putting the country at risk to beef up Wall Street’s bottom line.</p>
<p>It’s the scam of the century.</p>

			<p><strong>Too complex to function, too overcrowded to solve anything, too many people from too many places, too few resources&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/dystopiahome3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>One reader of this series asked that I write about what we face 10 years from now instead of 37 years from now. He asked me to become more “relevant” as to what our country faces.  He felt that 37 years in the future felt too far away to make any impact on Americans today.</p>
<p>The run-up to that 100 million, that’s 100,000,000 immigrants by 2050 won’t be a pretty one.  We face greater and greater consequences within 10 years by adding 30 million that will magnify to 60 million in 20 years and reach 90 million 30 years and 100 million immigrants within 37 years.  On top of that, we will add another 38 million of our own.  Total: 138 million people to feed, water, house, warm, transport, work, educate, medicate and try to maintain some kind of balance with our environment. This won’t be pretty for anyone.</p>
<p>We remain on course to become SO large that we cannot solve our problems.   To give you an example, India today suffers 1,000 children that die every 24 hours 7 days a week of water borne diseases like dysentery and diarrhea.   They die because India cannot maintain clean water from its toxic rivers, lakes and underground water supplies.  Millions upon millions of Indians urinate and defecate onto the soils in India because they lack toilets and sewage treatment plants.  Yet, they add 11 million new citizens into their society every year, year in and year out.  Most Indian people live in horrendously degraded conditions.  Air pollution, unsafe water and horribly crowded cities make life in that country a living hell.   Guess what, it’s coming to America.</p>
<p>Millions of Indians immigrated to America in the last few decades.  They arrive and then, chain-migrate their relatives through our immigration laws. They command virtually all the motel chains in America with your tax dollars being used to fund them.</p>
<p>Who can blame them?  If we give them the keys to the country, they would be fools to pass it up.  They flee a country that cannot save itself from itself.</p>
<p>When I visited India, it made me sick to my stomach to see little children starving in the cities. No one could help them because their numbers exceeded any aid.  I witnessed so much misery that I had to “harden” my emotions in order to make it through each day.  Most of Asia lives in utter misery and deprivation.  They cannot fix or solve their predicament.</p>
<p>Even more sobering, demographic experts project somewhere between 50 and 100 million refugees streaming into other countries in the next 10 to 20 years.  Africa’s desperate refugees already pour into Europe.  They overrun Spain and Greece.  As Haiti adds another projected three million to its present day nightmare, they will swim, boat and paddle their way to Florida by the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>Dr. Jack Alpert, at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Skil.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2xaNvovlR2E6YJRnOTeWZXrO0lA" target="_blank">www.Skil.org</a>, a research scientist predicts that we could see 1 billion people perish around the globe from lack of food within the next 10 years; 15 years at the most.</p>
<p>Watch these two videos:  Alpert shows where these countries lack enough water and arable land to feed their populations:</p>

<p>Do you think they will sit in their own countries and starve?  Will they wait to be saved?  Answer: No! They will migrate to Canada, America, Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>Instead of shielding ourselves from the coming nightmare facing our country, our intellectually-challenged Congress injects millions upon millions more immigrants into our country.  Whether it’s the 48.1 million Americans subsisting on food stamps today, to 100 million devouring food stamps in 30 years—something must give.</p>
<p>I can only imagine that our civilization will begin to collapse even before that 100 million legal immigrants manifest. If we do manage to hang on, it means race riots, food riots and racial separation where European-Americans flee to Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota.  Chicago, LA and Detroit portend our future.  They possess one thing in common: massive influx of legal and illegal immigrants that drive out Americans.</p>
<p>In the end, people align with their own tribes and we possess so many different tribes that we lack any cohesion within our society to maintain any rational order.  With another 100 million immigrants from all over the world, we encase a “schizophrenic society” and like Humpty Dumpty, “All the king’s horses and all the king’s men, couldn’t put Humpty Dumpty together again.”</p>
<p>As the great historian Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall, and that, “An autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.”</p>
<p>As Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm said on the eight methods for destroying America, “First, turn America into a bilingual or multi lingual and bicultural country.  History shows that no nation can survive the tension, conflict and antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures.  It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; however, it is a curse for a society to be bilingual.  The historical scholar Seymour Lipset put it this way, “The histories of bilingual and bicultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension and tragedy.  Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, Lebanon—all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with Basques, Bretons and Corsicans.”</p>
<p>We write our own death sentence with passage of the S744 amnesty into law in 2014.  We face 100 million volatile, multi-language, multi-religious and multiple-cultures that lack any compatibility with our civilization.  If the sheer numbers don’t destroy us, the endless conflicting cultures will ring our death knell.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to see our country turned into a schizophrenic cultural quagmire, call Speaker of the House John Boehner at <a href="tel:1%20202%20225%200600" target="_blank">1 202 225 0600</a>:</p>
<p>“Mr. Boehner, I understand that S744 doubles legal immigration from its current 1.0 million annually to 2.0 million while giving amnesty to 12 to 20 million illegal migrants. Do you understand that such an amnesty would flood America with over 100 million immigrants by 2050—a scant 37 years from now. How will we be able to water, house, work, feed, educate, medicate and care for that many people when we already suffer 48 million Americans who cannot secure jobs and live on food stamps? How will we maintain our environment and standard of living in light of those numbers. As an American citizen, I demand that you reduce all immigration to less than 100,000 annually and enforce the laws on the books to arrest, prosecute and jail employers of illegal migrants. That will help illegal migrants to go home on their own dime when they don’t have a job. Our own unemployed citizens can take those jobs at a living wage.”</p>
<p>Also: call your own U.S. Senators and leave the same message.</p>

<p>Are Americans ready to accept a police state? Are pastors and Christians ready to accept a police state? Are Republicans and conservatives ready to accept a police state? Are Democrats and liberals ready to accept a police state? Are there truly enough people left in this country who even understand what a police state is, and if they do, would they really support it?</p>
<p>I can hear many readers shouting, “No!” But I truly wonder just how many Americans have already accepted the police state in their hearts and minds. It is absolutely true that before despots and tyrants can put shackles around men’s necks, they must first put them around men’s hearts. So, just how many of the American people are walking around every day with shackles already around their hearts? How many pastors mount the pulpits with shackles around their hearts? How many teachers enter the classroom with shackles around their hearts? How many State lawmakers walk into their various capitols with shackles around their hearts? How many police officers get into their squad cars with shackles around their hearts? How many military personnel put on their uniforms with shackles around their hearts?</p>
<p>Those of us who are passionate about the freedom fight spend a lot of time discussing and debating the nuances of how best to protect liberty. Except for a precious few, our State governors, attorney generals, legislators, senators, mayors, county commissioners, city councilmen, etc., are doing a fantastically lousy job of honoring their oaths to the Constitution and to the principles contained in our Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights. Except for a precious few, our pastors, deacons, elders, and church leaders are doing a fantastically lousy job of defending freedom principles. Except for a precious few, our civic and business leaders are doing a fantastically lousy job of defending liberty. And needless to say, you could put the people on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., who are even doing diddly-squat about preserving liberty into an old-fashioned phone booth.</p>
<p>Republicans? Most of them have never seen a bill that expands the police state at home and foreign wars abroad that they did not absolutely love. Democrats? Most of them have never seen a bill that expanded government (any government) that they did not absolutely love. Yes, yes, I know that there are a few&#8211;a precious few&#8211;exceptions to the above, but not many.</p>
<p>But are the American people truly ready to accept a police state? A recent report at InfoWars.com is quite shocking to those of us who tend to believe that most of our fellow Americans would recoil at the thought of an open police state.</p>
<p>Reporting for InfoWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson writes, “After illustrating their enthusiasm for repealing the Bill of Rights, a video shows Americans happily signing a petition to support a ‘Nazi-style Orwellian police state,’ in what easily represents the most shocking footage of its kind to date.</p>
<p>“Citing issues with how the government shutdown has impacted the ability of the police to ‘keep the community safe,’ [Mark] Dice tells San Diegans that there is a need to ‘increase the Orwellian system.’</p>
<p>“‘Not a problem,’ responds one man as he signs the petition.</p>
<p>“‘We just want to model it after the Nazi Germany system to keep people safe and secure,’ Dice tells another individual.</p>
<p>“After signing the petition to ‘implement the Orwellian police state,’ another man responds, ‘You find the pot of money though,’ apparently more concerned about how much a Nazi-style police state would cost than its actual consequences.</p>
<p>“‘They’re trying to cut the budget by 20 per cent so we just want to make sure that we can model the police state after the Nazi Germany system,’ Dice tells another couple who sign the petition, before adding, ‘Thanks for supporting the police state.’</p>
<p>“‘We’re going to model it after the Nazi Germany-style police state,’ Dice clearly tells another man who signs the petition.</p>
<p>“‘We need this Orwellian-style system to keep everybody safe,’ Dice tells a woman as she is signing the petition, to which she responds, ‘Yeah.’”</p>
<p>See Watson’s report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infowars.com%2Famericans-sign-petition-to-support-nazi-style-orwellian-police-state%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFE7WKkBT9weJYLTOur4TzFnndsTA" target="_blank">Americans Sign Petition to Support “Nazi-Style Orwellian Police State”</a></p>
<p>So, how many of your friends, relatives, co-workers, neighbors, fellow club members, fellow pastors, and fellow church members would be willing to sign such a petition as mentioned above? Probably more than you would think. Why don’t you use Mark Dice’s technique and go stand with a petition on a street corner in your town or on a sidewalk outside the entrance of your church and find out? But be prepared for a shock. It is not just San Diegans that are already wearing the shackles around their hearts.</p>
<p>Those of us in the liberty movement are knocking our brains out trying to devise the best strategy to preserve the vestiges of freedom that are left in this country. The assaults against our liberties are ubiquitous&#8211;and so are the battlefronts upon which our fellow freedom-fighters are tirelessly and relentlessly defending the hill. Thank God for every one of them! I may or may not agree with each strategy or the people who come up with them, but if they are in the liberty fight, they are my brothers and compatriots.</p>
<p>But it is time for us to ask ourselves, are we living in a country in which a sizeable percentage of people do not care about, and may actually not WANT, liberty? Are we living in a country in which a sizeable percentage of people have already accepted the shackles of tyranny around their hearts?</p>
<p>I’m talking about Democrats and Republicans; Christians and unbelievers; pastors and pagans; liberals and conservatives; whites and blacks; educated and illiterate; rich and poor; men and women; northerners and southerners; easterners and westerners; military and civilians. How many are already wearing the shackles of tyranny around their hearts? I’m afraid far more than most of us want to admit.</p>
<p>At this point, I must make the following observation: if you are living in a State that does not recognize your right to keep and BEAR arms, if you live in a State that significantly impedes your right to possess and CARRY arms, if you live in a State that is unfriendly to the Second Amendment, you are living in a State in which a majority of lawmakers and citizens are already wearing the tyrant’s yoke around their hearts&#8211;and they want you to wear it, too.  And if you live in a large metropolitan city anywhere, you are living in one of liberty’s most inhospitable and hostile places. In all candor, one of the chief reasons why my family and I moved to a small town in a rural State (the Flathead Valley of Montana) is because of what I’m talking about right now.</p>
<p>For more information on our move to Montana, please go to this web page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchuckbaldwinlive.com%2FLinks%2FNewsLinks.aspx%3FCategory%3DBaldwins%25E2%2580%2599%2520Move%2520to%2520Montana&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9LgkjdkT5jEUfeTMrtc9rQTn_jQ" target="_blank">Baldwins’ Move To Montana</a></p>
<p>I realize that we have our share of big-government weenies here in Montana, too. I know we have a bunch of politicians and people who carry the shackles of tyranny around their hearts. I won’t argue that. But I also know that if police agencies in this area attempted a military lockdown such as took place in Boston after the marathon bombings, they would start a modern-day revolution. I KNOW that the majority of people in the Flathead Valley would never submit to such a police state. I also believe that the vast majority of law enforcement officers in this area would never attempt to enact such a police state.</p>
<p>As an example, according to published reports, the average home in the State of Montana has 27 firearms in it. Yes, you read it right: 27. I dare say that the average pickup truck in Montana has more guns in it than the average house in just about any other State.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Thomas Jefferson was right: big cities are the “bane” of freedom. And those states that are controlled by big cities are also a major culprit in the demise of liberty.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Boston’s Gun Bible (BGB) ranked the states in order of their recognition of the right to keep and bear arms. According to BGB, the freest states are:</p>
<p>1. Vermont<br />
2. Idaho and Kentucky (tie)<br />
3. Louisiana and Alaska (tie)<br />
4. Wyoming<br />
5. Montana</p>
<p>And, again, according to BGB, the least free states are:</p>
<p>1. New Jersey<br />
2. Illinois<br />
3. Hawaii<br />
4. Massachusetts<br />
5. New York</p>
<p>Now, I would personally argue BGB’s ranking of Montana as number 5 in the list of freest states&#8211;especially when it comes to the Second Amendment. Regardless, notice the absence of the dominance of big-cities within the list of freest states, contrasted with the obvious dominance of big-cities within the list of least free states. In the list of freest states, only Kentucky and Louisiana have a metro area with over one million population. And in the case of Vermont, Idaho, Alaska, Wyoming, and Montana, the State with the largest population is Idaho with just over 1.5 million&#8211;in the ENTIRE STATE. The conclusion should be obvious: big cities equal less freedom; rural states equal more freedom.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this divergence of philosophy and the willingness or unwillingness of people in big city states and rural states to either accept or reject tyranny is a boiling pot that at some point is going to spill over onto the eye of the stove. Notice that Mr. Dice’s petition was asked of people in one of America’s largest population centers: San Diego, California. Take that same petition to the streets of Kalispell, Montana; Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; or Wasilla, Alaska; and the response would be MUCH different.</p>
<p>I don’t believe tyranny will come to America all at once; it will come piecemeal, city by city, State by State, and region by region. And liberty will be preserved the same way.</p>
<p>So, are Americans ready to accept a police state? It all depends on where you live.</p>
<p>P.S. This weekend, selected cities across the country will be privileged to see the premiere screening of James Jaeger’s fantastic new movie, “MOLON LABE: How The Second Amendment Guarantees America’s Freedom.” The film features such notable freedomists as Pat Buchanan, Ron Paul, Larry Pratt, G. Edward Griffin, Alex Jones, and, yes, yours truly&#8211;along with several others. It is terrific film. The people of the Flathead Valley in Montana are fortunate to be able to attend this premiere showing at the Mountain Cinema 4 theaters in Whitefish, Montana, at 11am Mountain Time, this Saturday, October 26. If you live within driving distance, you are invited to attend this premiere screening. DVDs of the film will be available at the showing.</p>
<p>If you are not able to go see MOLON LABE this weekend and would like to order the DVD of this new film, you may do so NOW. Order the MOLON LABE DVD here:</p>

				<p>October 18, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18937#respond" title="Comment on Is Secession’s Time Coming Again?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="18937 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18937">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/secession-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/secession-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Pat Buchanan recently wrote an intriguing column titled, “Is Red State America Seceding?” His column clearly reveals that an independence/secession movement is spreading globally. Pat rightly observes that in just the last few years some 25 nations have broken free of mother countries and formed their own independent states. And, no, most of these separations did NOT require violent revolution. In addition, talk of secession is currently going on in at least six other regions of the world. And, as Buchanan correctly observes, the spirit of secession is very much alive and well in the United States.</p>
<p>Buchanan writes, “The five counties of western Maryland&#8211;Garrett, Allegany, Washington, Frederick and Carroll, which have more in common with West Virginia and wish to be rid of Baltimore and free of Annapolis, are talking secession.”</p>
<p>But people in Maryland are not the only ones talking secession. Buchanan continues to write, “Ten northern counties of Colorado are this November holding non-binding referenda to prepare a future secession from Denver and the creation of America’s 51st state.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, people in northern California are also talking secession. Again, to quote Pat Buchanan: “In California, which many have long believed should be split in two, the northern counties of Modoc and Siskiyou on the Oregon border are talking secession&#8211;and then union in a new state called Jefferson.”</p>
<p>Buchanan goes on to say, “Folks on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, bordered by Wisconsin and the Great Lakes, which is connected to lower Michigan by a bridge, have long dreamed of a separate state called Superior. The UP has little in common with Lansing and nothing with Detroit.</p>
<p>“While the folks in western Maryland, northern Colorado, northern California and on the Upper Peninsula might be described as red state secessionists, in Vermont the secessionists seem of the populist left. The Montpelier Manifesto of the Second Vermont Republic concludes:</p>
<p>“‘Citizens, lend your names to this manifesto and join in the honorable task of rejecting the immoral, corrupt, decaying, dying, failing American Empire and seeking its rapid and peaceful dissolution before it takes us all down with it.’”</p>
<p>Pat concludes his column saying, “This sort of intemperate language may be found in Thomas Jefferson’s indictment of George III. If America does not get its fiscal house in order, and another Great Recession hits or our elites dragoon us into another imperial war, we will likely hear more of such talk.”</p>
<p>See Pat Buchanan’s column here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnd.com%2F2013%2F10%2Fis-red-state-america-seceding%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBvqiV5yVa3zgww_spLNUH-bIquw" target="_blank">Is Red State America Seceding?</a></p>
<p>Buchanan’s analysis is right on the money. The spirit of independence is far from dead in the United States. In fact, the spirit of independence (otherwise known as the Spirit of ’76) has already begun driving people to separate from states and cities in which they have lived for most or all of their lives. The biggest recipient of these many thousands of freedom-minded people seems to be the Rocky Mountain States of America’s Northwest.</p>
<p>Faithful readers of this column know that my entire family, including five heads of households and some 18 family members, relocated to the Flathead Valley of Montana after having lived a lifetime&#8211;or the better part of a lifetime&#8211;in the southeastern United States. And during the last three years, I have witnessed scores of families also relocate to northwestern Montana from all over the country.</p>
<p>But it’s not just Chuck Baldwin’s move or the people from around the country who have decided to join us here in the Flathead Valley: thousands of people are relocating to what is now commonly referred to as “The American Redoubt.” This area includes Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, eastern Washington State, and eastern Oregon.</p>
<p>By the way, to read a compilation of articles as to why my family and I chose the Flathead Valley of Montana to which to relocate, peruse the material here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchuckbaldwinlive.com%2FLinks%2FNewsLinks.aspx%3FCategory%3DBaldwins%25E2%2580%2599%2520Move%2520to%2520Montana&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9LgkjdkT5jEUfeTMrtc9rQTn_jQ" target="_blank">Baldwins’ Move To Montana</a></p>
<p>Just recently, Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) did a television report on the growing numbers of people who are relocating to The American Redoubt. See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbn.com%2Ftv%2F2742102419001&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmEnMq2hpTpw8lQ1Y_dW4cQRinLw" target="_blank">Redoubt: Northwest a Haven For Dismayed Americans</a></p>
<p>The mood all over America is one of intense uncertainty and uneasiness. More and more Americans are waking up to the reality that Washington, D.C., is hopelessly broken (financially and morally), and it’s only a matter of time before something catastrophic happens. They see the way America’s major cities are becoming more and more tyrannical and crime-infested.</p>
<p>In the major cities, public schools more and more resemble prisons; police departments more and more resemble the German Gestapo; local governments more and more try to make criminals out of honest gun owners and more and more attack the Christian values that were once revered in this country. Add any major disaster (natural or man-made) to these growing concerns and the prospect for a normal life in the big cities is practically zero. People are yearning to be more self-reliant, more independent, more secure, and, yes, more free. In fact, for a host of people today, the longing for liberty trumps the desire for wealth and pleasure. What used to attract people to big cities now repulses them. And they are more than willing to downscale their incomes and living standards in order to live simpler and breath freer.<br />
In reality, secession is not a future event; it has already started. People all over America are separating from their homes and families, from their jobs and livelihoods, from their cities and states, and from their very way of life in order to find even a semblance of what America used to look like. This trend will not diminish anytime soon. In fact, I am convinced it has not yet begun to peak.</p>
<p>So, don’t despair my friends. The Spirit of ’76 is alive and well&#8211;and not just in America but in many regions around the world also. The smell of independence is in the air. It smells so sweet. Take a big whiff. Then prayerfully decide to what and to where that wind is leading you.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan’s analysis of the modern independence movement just might be more of a prophecy than anything else.</p>
<p>I cannot help but think of the speech John Adams gave to the Continental Congress as it contemplated the Declaration of Independence. When one thinks of fiery speeches for independence, one normally thinks of Patrick Henry, Sam Adams, or James Otis. But John Adams’ speech to the Continental Congress ranks up there with the greatest of them. So, for all of my freedom-loving brothers and sisters in America and around the world who are already, in their own way, engaged in the independence movement, I conclude this column with the concluding words from that immortal speech:</p>
<p>“Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see, I see clearly, through this day’s business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not live to the time when this Declaration shall be made good. We may die; die, colonists; die, slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on the scaffold. Be it so; be it so! If it be the pleasure of heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But, while I do live, let me have a country, or at least, the hope of a country, and that a free country.</p>
<p>“But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured that this Declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood, but it will stand, and it will richly compensate for both. Through the thick gloom of the present, I see the brightness of the future, as the sun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires and illuminations. On its annual return, they will shed tears, copious, gushing tears, not of subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of gratitude and of joy.</p>
<p>“Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves this measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I hope, in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it. And I leave off as I began, that, live or die, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment, Independence now, and INDEPENDENCE FOREVER!”</p>
<p>Amen and Amen!</p>

			<div class="date">
				<p>July 7, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18097#respond" title="Comment on Comprehensive List Of Companies That Uses Aborted Fetal Cells As Flavor"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="18097 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18097">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="http://www.lifesitenews.com/images/sized/images/news/Pepsico_logo-240x180.jpg" alt="" />Children of God for Life is calling on the public to boycott products of major food companies that are partnering with Senomyx, a biotech company that produces artificial flavor enhancers, unless the company stops using aborted fetal cell lines to test their products.</p>
<p>In 2010, the pro-life organization wrote to Senomyx CEO Kent Snyder, pointing out that moral options for testing their food additives could and should be used.</p>
<p>But when Senomyx ignored their letter, they  wrote to the companies Senomyx listed on their website as “collaborators” warning them of public backlash and threatened boycott.  Food giants Pepsico, Kraft Foods, Campbell Soup, Solae and Nestlé are the primary targets of the boycott, though Senomyx boasts other international partners on their website.</p>
<p><a title="Senomyx" href="http://www.senomyx.com/" target="_blank">Senomyx</a> website states that “<strong>The company’s key flavor programs focus on the discovery and development of savory, sweet and salt flavor ingredients that are intended to allow for the reduction of MSG, sugar and salt in food and beverage products.</strong>…Using isolated human taste receptors, we created proprietary taste receptor-based assay systems that provide a biochemical or electronic readout when a flavor ingredient interacts with the receptor.”</p>
<p>Senomyx notes their collaborators provide them research and development funding plus royalties on sales of products using their flavor ingredients.</p>
<p>“What they do not tell the public is that they are using HEK 293 – human embryonic kidney cells taken from an electively aborted baby to produce those receptors”, stated Debi Vinnedge, Executive Director for Children of God for Life, a pro-life watch dog group that has been monitoring the use of aborted fetal material in medical products and cosmetics for years.</p>
<p>“They could have easily chosen COS (monkey) cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, insect cells or other morally obtained human cells expressing the G protein for taste receptors”, Vinnedge added.</p>
<p>In writing to their collaborators, it took three letters before Nestlé finally admitted the truth about their relationship with Senomyx, noting the cell line was “well established in scientific research”.</p>
<p>After hearing Ms Vinnedge speak publicly on the problem, angry consumers began writing the companies. Both Pepsico and Campbell Soup immediately responded.</p>
<p>Shockingly, Pepsico wrote: “We hope you are reassured to learn that our collaboration with Senomyx is strictly limited to creating lower-calorie, great-tasting beverages for consumers. This will help us achieve our commitment to reduce added sugar per serving by 25% in key brands in key markets over the next decade and ultimately help people live healthier lives.”</p>
<p>Campbell Soup was more concerned in their response: “Every effort is made to use the finest ingredients and develop the greatest selection of products, all at a great value. With this in mind, it must be said that the trust we have cultivated and developed over the years with our consumers is not worth compromising to cut costs or increase profit margins.”</p>
<p>While Campbell did not state they would change their methods, still their response, gave Vinnedge hope.</p>
<p>“If enough people voice their outrage and intent to boycott these consumer products, it can be highly effective in convincing Senomyx to change their methods”, she noted.</p>

<p><strong>Back in January, Oklahoma Senator Ralph Shortey proposed legislation to ban the production of aborted fetal cell-derived flavor chemicals in his home state</strong>.

<p><strong>To be clear, the aborted fetal tissue used to make Pepsi’s flavor chemicals does not end up in the final product sold to customers, according to reports</strong> — it is used, instead, to evaluate how actual human taste receptors respond to these chemical flavorings.

<p><strong><a title="Origin of HEK 293 cells" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEK_293" target="_blank">Origins of HEK 293 Cells</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>HEK 293 cells were generated in the early 70s by transformation of cultures of normal human embryonic kidney cells with sheared <a title="Adenovirus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenovirus">adenovirus</a> 5 <a title="DNA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> in Alex Van der Eb’s laboratory in Leiden, The Netherlands.</strong></p>
<p>The human embryonic kidney cells were obtained from an aborted fetus and originally cultured by Van der Eb himself; the transformation by adenovirus was performed by Frank Graham who published his findings in the late 1970s after he left Leiden for <a title="McMaster University" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_University">McMaster University</a> in Canada.</p>
<p>They are called HEK for human embryonic kidney, while the number 293 comes from Graham’s habit of numbering his experiments; the original HEK 293 cell clone was simply the product of his 293rd experiment.</p>

<p>I think, at the very least, YouTube should censor them. Well, wait a minute. Not censor, but put up a notice on all their videos:</p>
<p>“<i>It’s come to our attention that these three characters are as annoying as a bad case of fleas. Caution: watch and listen at your own risk.”</i></p>
<p>The three stooges. Three schmucks in the fountain. Send in the clowns, don’t bother, they’re here.</p>
<p>If people are beginning to get the idea I’m waging a war against against elite media, they’re right.</p>
<p>At the same time, I’m fascinated. How do these anchors do it? How do they lie so consistently, and with such aplomb, day in and day out, without going up in puff of smoke and vanishing?</p>
<p>The Big Three anchors are a miracle, in the sense that they need a whole construction company to build the walls that permanently separate them from the truth…so they can sit in a television studio in New York and believe they’re in the wheelhouse of Real News.</p>
<p>When you see the Big Three are discussing their own footage, but you find visual clues as big as the moon that their analysis is 180 degrees away from actual fact—as has been happening from Aurora to Sandy Hook to Boston—and the Stooges just sit there and drone on…well, that’s a CSI or a Law&amp;Order you just can’t get if you pay the best scriptwriters in the world to come up with it.</p>
<p>“The bomb was a pressure cooker.”</p>
<p>Right, and the Twin Towers went down because two planes flew into them.</p>
<p>Because the Web has been alive and humming, media coverage of every major catastrophe since 9/11 has been rejected by extraordinary numbers of people.</p>
<p>The elite network anchors have been trying to hold the fort, but they’re failing.</p>
<p>Their long-running stage play is closing down.</p>
<p>Despite their traditional skills and technological backup, they’re coming across like cartoon hacks.</p>
<p>These days, it’s better to be a marginally believable doofus like Diane Sawyer, who chooses to affect a persona based on depression, than to be the eternal boy wonder, Brian Williams. Williams, the smoothest of the smooth, comes across like the biggest liar, because he’s the most dedicated of the lot when it comes to defending the indefensible.</p>
<p>And Scott Pelley is Scott Pelley, the hospital doctor you’d least like to show up at your bedside. He might tell you you need an amputation just because he’s having a bad day.</p>
<p>“Who do we need for the most important anchor’s job in the world?”</p>
<p>“How about Pelley? He’s utterly convinced the lies we feed into the propaganda machine are the last word.. He’s sold. He couldn’t look outside the box if we drilled holes in it and let him see a mountain of gold bars and 50,000 naked bureaucrats running down Broadway at high fucking noon.”</p>
<p>The Big Three strut their stuff on the evening news, executing well-oiled, high-priced transitions from one completely false/basically deceptive story to another completely false/basically deceptive story.</p>
<p>Recall the often-quoted George Burns pearl? “In acting, sincerity is everything. If you can fake that, you’ve got it made.” But suppose the sincerity isn’t faked? Then, the schmuck becomes king.</p>
<p>My late friend and colleague, hypnotherapist Jack True, described the television-news audience: “Mind control is accepting what you know to be false. You do it because you think the only other alternative is a vacuum: you either buy the news or you’re left with nothing.”</p>
<p>Once in a while, you can see cracks. Scott Pelley, stewing in his juices, looks like he’s ready to pull his uncle’s old revolver out of his pocket and fire a few rounds at the teleprompter.</p>
<p>Diane Sawyer appears to be on the verge of sagging to her right and collapsing out of her chair, on her way to a fit of copious weeping.</p>
<p>Brian Williams wants to say, more than anything, “Live From New York, it’s Saturday night!” Then a few coiled springs pop out of the top of his head and he winds down and stops moving.</p>
<p>Subliminally, the three stooges are announcing: “We’re showing you the most important stories of our time, and each one has a television lifespan of ninety seconds, after which they no longer exist.”</p>
<p>Television news is really all segue all the time. That’s what it comes down to.</p>
<p>The word “segue,” pronounced “segway,” refers to a transition from one thing to another, a blend.</p>
<p>Ed McMahon once referred to Johnny Carson as the prince of blends, because Carson could tell a clunker of a joke, step on it three times, and still move to the next joke without losing his audience.</p>
<p>Television news is very serious business. A reporter who can’t handle segues is dead in the water. He’s a gross liability.</p>
<p>The good anchors can take two stories that have no connection whatsoever and create a sense of smooth transition.</p>
<p>Brian Williams can say, “The planes were recalled later in the afternoon. And a man was castrated in a horrific accident in Idaho today…” And no one says, WHAT? WAIT!</p>
<p>You take an elevator up to the 15<sup>th</sup> floor in an office building. The door opens and you step into a medieval dungeon. That doesn’t compute in real life, but it does on the news.</p>
<p>The networks basically have, on a daily basis, fragmented stories, and they need an anchor who can do the blends, the segues, and get away with it, to promote the sense of one continuous flow.</p>
<p>So the audience doesn’t say, “This is just an odd collection of crap.”</p>
<p>The news is all segue all the time.</p>
<p>Not just nationally. On the local level, too. The pounding lead-in music at the top of the show is a segue, to prepare the audience. A) Music. B) “Tonight, our top story: a man ate a hot dog and died …”</p>
<p>The voice of the anchor is the non-stop blending machine that ties all news stories together. That’s why the elite network stars earn their paychecks.</p>
<p>Good segue people are stage magicians. They can move the viewer’s attention from item A to item B without a tremor or a doubt.</p>
<p>It’s often been said of certain actors, “He could read from the phone book and you’d listen.” Well, an elite anchor can hold the viewer’s mind as he reads a sentence from the phone book, another one from a car-repair manual, a third from a cookbook, and a fourth from a funeral-home brochure. Without stopping.</p>
<p>And afterward, the viewer would have no questions.</p>
<p>The news is surreal because the stories are mostly fool’s gold to begin with; and they’re unrelated. They’re rocks lying around on the floor. The anchor picks them up and invents the illusion of One Flowing Stream.</p>
<p>This is what the audience wants. It feels like a story. It feels like unity. It feels like a stage play or a movie. It feels, when all is said and done, good.</p>
<p>The anchor (as his title suggests) holds the fragments together in one place. For the audience, he’s the focus. He’s the maestro. The hypnotist.</p>
<p>You can’t pull anyone off the street and have him describe car crashes, murders, storms, threats of war, political squabbles, 300 cats living in a one-room apartment, a new piece of Medicare legislation, genitalia picture tweets, and the dedication of a library, <a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/the-mind-control-qualities-of-brian-williams-diane-sawyer-and-scott-pelley/" target="_blank">while placing and keeping millions of people in a light trance</a>.</p>
<p>Katie Couric couldn’t do it. People were waiting for her to break out into an attack of Perky and giggle and cross her legs. Diane Sawyer does it poorly. She seems to be affecting somber personal grief as her basic segue-thread. Scott Pelley is competent, but he sits like a surgeon ready to signal the anesthesiologist to clamp a mask on your face, before he cuts into your stomach.</p>
<p>Brian Williams is the current king of segue. He does smooth-serious-affable-employee-of-the-month-I-know-all-the-news-is-true.</p>
<p>None of these elite anchors can hold a candle to Cronkite or Chet Huntley, the past masters. Ed Murrow was the first star-practitioner of the television-news form. He was working a kind of sepulchral spin-off of Hemingway prose.</p>
<p>Murrow got his first break, right out of college, working for the Institute of International Education, a pathetic front for what they used to call “internationalists” (aka globalists). Elihu Root founded the organization. Root was also founding chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations and president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In other words, one world together actually meant: all you peons down there and we wise men on top…</p>
<p>Anyway, all anchors can do segue. They are dedicated to The Blend. They put their souls, such as they are, into transitions.</p>
<p>“What do you want to do when you grow up, Brian?”</p>
<p>“I want to take people from A to B.”</p>
<p>Whereas, a true version of the news would go something like this: “Today, in fact just now, I moved from a tornado in Kansas to the removal of restrictions on condom sales, and I’m blending into penguins in Antarctica. I’m doing Salvador Dali and you’re not noticing a thing.”</p>
<p>What does all this tell us? The news, if it were taken apart into its component pieces, would look quite surreal. And the anchor, by blending, manufactures a hypnotic illusion of interconnection.</p>
<p>The audience wants to be put in a trance. Even a several-day event, like the Boston bombing, with all its twists and turns, doesn’t mitigate that basic big sleep. Television news, with a good anchor, with the television screen itself, with the electromagnetic emissions and frequencies, can attain and hold the hypnotic state.</p>
<p>Therefore, the content of the news sinks in below the level of the rational mind.</p>
<p>But with each shift in story line, with each new breaking bit of revelation, with each disturbing image, the anchor must be there to execute the segues.</p>
<p>He is basically saying to the audience, “I’m a few feet inside your personal landscape, your mind, feeding you all the turns in the river, and I’ll always be here, so things are all right…”</p>
<p>Elite anchors invent and maintain certain tones of voice, certain rhythms, certain cadences, certain variations of musical pitch, throughout the stage play, in order to sustain the sense of continuity.</p>
<p>They’re mechanics of voice.</p>
<p>They use their skills to report the false facts handed down to conceal ops and staged events.</p>
<p>They need to believe in what they’re doing. They need to be that stupid. Talent search: 130 IQ, inherently stupid.</p>
<p>They can know they’re actors on television, but they have to believe they’re acting out the truth. Ends justify the means. Of course, “truth” often means to them: that which will bind us all together.</p>
<p>What is the role they’re cast in? It’s: Normal. It’s a heavy part in the play, because this joke of a society has a prime-cut value called Normal.</p>
<p>“Okay, look,” the Broadway director says to the veteran actor he’s interviewing for the lead, in a billion-dollar production. “This may sound strange, but you’re going to have to do Normal as it’s never been done before. That’s what the audience wants. You’ve got to come across as very, very smart and very, very Normal. Get it? I mean, you can emit a few rays of Elite here and there, but you have to do that Normal dance. The audience has to believe you somehow fit in with being a solid American, whatever the hell that is. You can be the news boy down the street, riding his bike, tossing papers on front porches (Brian Williams), wholesome as Wonder Bread, or you can be a socialite on the Upper East Side teetering on the verge of a nervous breakdown (Diane Sawyer), or you can be a doctor moving briskly through his morning hospital rounds telling the interns trailing behind him what incompetent assholes they are (Scott Pelley)…but it has to be Normal at the same time. You’re the brain of every other brain. You’re the conscience of every other conscience. You’re just as walled off from the conspiracy to own every inch of America and grind down the people into dust-bowl hell as all Americans are walled off from knowing about it. You know as little as they do. You’re just as clueless as the great unwashed, but you put your stupidity on display with some measure of grace and style. Got it? You’re clean, sanitary, loyal as a dog, dumb as fog but very smart. You spew absolute nonsense every second of your time on stage, but it sounds plausible, and again, Normal. You constantly change subjects, and the subjects are in no way related to each other, but you make it all seem sensible. It’s a joke. But you’re serious. And you have to Believe, as if you’ve always believed, from the moment you emerged out of your mother’s body.</p>
<p>“And if you need a model for all this, just watch the news every night on the three major networks and focus on these geniuses.”</p>
<p>See the bomb exploding, the one that emits a puff of smoke straight up in the air? The one that was built in a pressure cooker? The bomb that didn’t tear the flags to pieces and didn’t shred the blue canopy right next to it? The bomb that didn’t cause the men in yellow jackets standing in front of it to even blink? That bomb vectored at a very low angle and took out people’s legs in the Boston street. That right, America. It did. I swear it did.</p>
<p>See the purple and pink pigs flying over the White House? They’re bringing food from Mars for all the bureaucrats who push paper in the city every day, the people who can’t be fired during the Sequester, while flights all over the country are delayed. That food from Mars keeps the paper pushers going. It does. It has special vitamins in it. See how fat the pigs in the sky are? How do you think they got that way? They ate the food. It’s so healthy. It’s mystical and magical. It’s just part of the largesse coming to you from your eternal government. Wait a little while longer. It’ll be here. There are lots more flying pigs. They’ll drop off little bags of Martian tasties on your street any week now. It’s the new Normal. Get used to it. We know what you want, and we’re going to give it to you.</p>
<p>We know what you want and we’re going to give it to you.</p>

			<p><strong>Americans take so many mood-altering and addictive pills that water supplies are being contaminated. Just ask the fish. Do the drugs in your water pose a risk to your health—and even your sobriety?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/tap-water3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/tap-water2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The idea that we’re being unwittingly drugged when we drink a glass of ordinary tap water smacks of dystopian science fiction or political conspiracy theory. Accusations that Communists were spiking America’s water with sedatives—under the cover of the federally instituted fluoridation program—were such a staple of Cold War–era paranoia that Stanley Kubrick satirized it in his 1964 masterpiece, <em>Dr. Strangelove.</em> While such fear-mongering may seem quaint, what’s truly ironic is that Americans today are consuming prescription drugs—including addictive psychoactive ones—via the water supply. Who knew?</p>
<p>There’s a good chance that if you live in an urban area, your tap water is laced with tiny amounts of antidepressants (mostly SSRIs like Prozac and Effexor), benzodiazepines (like Klonopin, used to reduce symptoms of substance withdrawal) and anticonvulsants (like Topomax, used to treat addiction to alcohol, nicotine, food and even cocaine and crystal meth). Such are the implications of environmental studies that have been leaking out over the past decade. Whether or not this psychoactive waste has any effect on the human nervous system remains unclear, but when such pharmaceuticals are introduced into the ecosystem, the fallout for other species is demonstrable—and potentially dire.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no mystery to the way prescription medications wind up in our tap water. Whether you flush a bottle of old pills down the toilet or, more likely, excrete the remains of a daily dose (an estimated 80% isn’t broken down in our bodies), active chemicals get recycled back into reservoirs because sewage treatment plants aren’t able to filter them out. “They just fly right through,” says Michael Thomas, an associate professor of bioinformatics at Idaho State University.</p>
<p>Although government officials and scientists are in no rush to look into this potential threat, some environmentalists are becoming worried. In <a href="http://tinyurl.com/c5hloyn">a preliminary study </a>at the University of Idaho, fathead minnows were plunked in water spiked with a combination of SSRIs and anticonvulsants—a lab version of American tap water. After swimming in the contaminated water for 18 days, the minnows exhibited 324 genetic alterations associated with human neurological disorders, including autism.</p>
<p>Mutated minnows admittedly do not signal a hazard of global-warming dimensions. Yet messed-up genes are what cause disease. <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/704701">Studies</a> have shown that regular doses of SSRIs can sometimes damage human DNA, most notably in sperm. The minnows offer evidence that even trace amounts of SSRIs can infiltrate DNA. For now, the implications for humans of ongoing exposure can only be extrapolated from the effects on wildlife: According to a 2008 <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydauvzp">AP investigation</a>, trace pharmaceuticals already contaminate a wide variety of species, from algae on up to mammals.</p>
<p>The peculiarities of sedative-fed perch were highlighted last month in a front- page article in <em><a href="http://tinyurl.com/bmgcabl">The New York Times.</a></em> The fish had been fed trace doses of oxazepam—a benzodiazepine commonly used in Europe—over a period of two months, as part of a Swedish study. The fish exposed to the anti-anxiety medication socialized less but ate more zooplankton and swam further, behaviors with potential long-term consequences for local ecosystems. This sparked fears among environmentalists that under the influence, the fish are more susceptible to predators, which could weaken the strength of the species. Not mentioned in the <em>Times</em> piece is the fact that SSRIs have been detected in plankton, which are a “foundation” organism in the food chain. “It&#8217;s inescapable,” Sudeep Chandra, an associate professor of natural resources and environmental science at the University of Nevada, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b798wzz">told </a>the AP. “There’s enough global information now to confirm [trace pharmaceuticals] are affecting organisms and wildlife.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>“This looks like a case of hidden mass medication upon the unsuspecting public,&#8221; a British Parliament member charged.</p></blockquote>
<p>This drugs-in-our-drinking-water issue has remained mostly below the radar of the government, researchers and the media. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ckeq8h6.">The AP </a>chalked up the lack of focus on the issue partly to government agencies&#8217; and nonprofits&#8217; wariness about stoking public fear. &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard topic to talk about without creating fear in the general public,”<a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydauvzp">said</a> the Water Research Foundation’s Robert Renna.</p>
<p>While the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates that other kinds of contaminants, such as pesticides and lead, be filtered out before our drinking water flows through a municipal tap, there remain no guidelines at all for pharmaceuticals, despite the fact that as far back as 2000, a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/age5gy9">US geological survey</a> found low levels in 80% of the rivers and streams sampled. Nor is much funding available for even rudimentary studies of this potential public health problem.</p>
<p>The EPA does not even track the statistics collected by the few municipalities that do surveillance. In 2008, after surveying results from the municipalities that did test, the AP found over 50 pharmaceuticals that “could harm humans” in the water of 41 million Americans. Because most cities don’t test—and those that do generally refuse to release their findings, citing “security concerns” —the actual number of affected people is almost certainly much higher. “I think we have a lot of work to do,”<a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydauvzp">said</a> the EPA’s Benjamin Grumbles.</p>
<p>The problem is not restricted to the US. Over a hundred trace pharmaceuticals have been <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b798wzz">detected</a> in waterways around the globe, from Pakistan to Finland. But the highest concentrations of drug pollution by far are here at home, where nearly half the population is on at least one prescribed medication. The 10% of Americans who take antidepressants (mostly SSRIs) accounted for 255 million scripts in 2010. With all that runoff, you might think Americans would be happier—and less addiction prone—than they are.</p>
<p>In Britain, where psychoactive drugs are prescribed at a fraction of US levels, a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/a7cdfth">2004 Environment Agency</a> study cited “low-level, almost continuous discharge” of Prozac through the tap water there. Parliament member Norman Baker stated ominously, “This looks like a case of hidden mass medication upon the unsuspecting public.” Yet no US municipalities have done similar measurements that quantify the amount of each drug detected. It’s reasonable to assume, however, that consistent quantities of trace antidepressants flow through American taps—especially since fish collected in fresh-water bodies near several urban centers have tested positive for these contaminants.</p>
<p>New York City is widely believed to have the nation&#8217;s cleanest tap water, which is supplied from protected upstate reservoirs. The feds consider these reservoirs so pure that the Big Apple’s H2O is not required to be filtered. As far as is known, no official agency has tested the city’s water supply for pharmaceuticals. Yet a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ag9u25v">2008 study</a> by Stony Brook University found a number of sedatives and anti-depressants in upstate waterways that feed the reservoirs. A <a href="http://tinyurl.com/acskk76">just-released study </a>by the Citizens Campaign for the Environment found that contrary to public health guidelines, over 50% of the medical facilities in nearby Suffolk County flush their unused meds down the toilet.</p>
<p>Because pharmaceutical compounds make their way into the watershed itself, private wells are also affected; as for the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/13/health/he-nutrition13">bottled </a>stuff, it&#8217;s no purer than most tap water because it comes from the same water sources. If prescription medications are being passed into the water supply, it follows that some illegal drugs must take the same route, although in substantially lower quantities. Sure enough, a<a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydauvzp">Spanish study </a>found cocaine in 22 of 24 random samples of that country’s tap water and an<a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydauvzp"> Italian study</a> found cocaine flowing through the Po River.</p>
<p>The future social and ecological fallout, if any, from the drugs in our drinking water is impossible to foresee. But in the short term, within the 12-step community, the issue could have a special resonance. Many AA members believe that true sobriety requires abstinence from all mood-altering drugs, whether addictive (like benzodiazepines) or not (like antidepressants). A <a href="http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-11_aamembersMedDrug.pdf">pamphlet</a> issued by AA’s General Services Conference warns that it’s “generally accepted” that these meds can “threaten the maintenance of sobriety.” But given the prevalence of these substances in the water supply, it appears that you can’t even drink a glass of good, old tap water without going off the wagon. Where does that leave people who believe in a literal interpretation of the Big Book? Crossing Italy and Spain off the travel itinerary is easy enough. It may also be time, for sanity’s sake, to take another look at what “total abstinence” means.</p>

			<p><img alt="37 Statistics Which Show How Four Years Of Obama Have Wrecked The U.S. Economy" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/37-Statistics-Which-Show-How-Four-Years-Of-Obama-Have-Wrecked-The-U.S.-Economy-300x214.jpg" width="230" height="214" align="left"/>The mainstream media covered the inauguration of Barack Obama with breathless anticipation on Monday, but should we really be celebrating another four years of Obama?  The truth is that the first four years of Obama were an absolute train wreck for the U.S. economy.  Over the past four years, the percentage of working age Americans with a job has fallen, median household income has declined by more than $4000, poverty in the U.S. has absolutely exploded and our national debt has ballooned to ridiculous proportions.  Of course all of the blame for the nightmarish performance of the economy should not go to Obama alone.  Certainly much of what we are experiencing today is the direct result of decades of very foolish decisions by Congress and previous presidential administrations.  And of course the <a title="Federal Reserve" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/category/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> has more influence over the economy than anyone else does.  But Barack Obama steadfastly refuses to criticize anything that the Federal Reserve has done and he even nominated Ben Bernanke for another term as Fed Chairman despite his horrific track record of failure, so at a minimum Barack Obama must be considered to be complicit in the Fed&#8217;s very foolish policies.  Despite what the Obama administration tells us, the U.S. economy has been in decline for a very long time, and that decline has accelerated in many ways over the past four years.  Just consider the statistics that I have compiled below.  The following are 37 statistics which show how four years of Obama have wrecked the U.S. economy&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> During Obama&#8217;s first term, the number of Americans on food stamps increased <a title="by an average of about 11,000 per day" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/first-term-food-stamp-recipients-increased-11133-day-under-obama" target="_blank">by an average of about 11,000 per day</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> At the beginning of the Obama era, <a title="32 million" href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34snapmonthly.htm" target="_blank">32 million</a> Americans were on food stamps.  Today, more than <a title="47 million" href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34snapmonthly.htm" target="_blank">47 million</a> Americans are on food stamps.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> According <a title="to one calculation" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/11/23/Exclusive-Food-Stamp-Recipients-Outnumber-Populations-Of-24-States-Combined" target="_blank">to one calculation</a>, the number of Americans on food stamps now exceeds the combined populations of &#8220;Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The number of Americans receiving money directly from the federal government each month has grown from 94 million in the year 2000 to<a title="more than 128 million" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-federal-government-hands-out-money-to-128-million-americans-every-month">more than 128 million</a> today.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> According to the U.S. Census Bureau, <a title="more than 146 million Americans" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/census-shows-1-in-2-peopl_1_n_1150128.html" target="_blank">more than 146 million Americans</a> are either &#8220;poor&#8221; or &#8220;low income&#8221; at this point.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The unemployment rate in the United States is exactly where it was (<a title="7.8 percent" href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/01/21/unemployment-rate-same-today-as-it-was-when-obama-first-took-office/" target="_blank">7.8 percent</a>) when Barack Obama first entered the White House in January 2009.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> When Barack Obama first entered the White House, <a title="60.6 percent" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/EMRATIO.txt" target="_blank">60.6 percent</a> of all working age Americans had a job.  Today, only <a title="58.6 percent" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/EMRATIO.txt" target="_blank">58.6 percent</a> of all working age Americans have a job.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> During the first four years of Obama, the number of Americans &#8220;not in the labor force&#8221; soared by an astounding <a title="8,332,000" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/first-term-americans-not-labor-force-increased-8332000" target="_blank">8,332,000</a>.  That far exceeds any previous four year total.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> During Obama&#8217;s first term, the number of Americans collecting federal disability insurance rose <a title="by more than 18 percent" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/first-term-americans-collecting-disability-increased-1385418-now-1-each-13-full-time" target="_blank">by more than 18 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> The Obama years have been absolutely devastating for small businesses in America.  According <a title="to economist Tim Kane" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/we-are-witnessing-the-death-of-small-business-in-america">to economist Tim Kane</a>, the following is how the number of startup jobs per 1000 Americans breaks down <a title="by presidential administration" href="http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/Kane--TheCollapseofStartupsinJobCreation0912web.pdf" target="_blank">by presidential administration</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>Bush Sr.: 11.3</p>
<p>Clinton: 11.2</p>
<p>Bush Jr.: 10.8</p>
<p>Obama: 7.8</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> Median household income in America has fallen for <a title="four consecutive years" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/things-are-getting-worse-median-household-income-has-fallen-4-years-in-a-row">four consecutive years</a>.  Overall, it has declined by over $4000 during that time span.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> The economy is not producing nearly enough jobs for the hordes of young people now entering the workforce.  Approximately <a title="53 percent" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/53-percent-of-all-young-college-graduates-in-america-are-either-unemployed-or-underemployed">53 percent</a>of all U.S. college graduates under the age of 25 were either unemployed or underemployed in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> According to a report from the National Employment Law Project, <a title="58 percent" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/economic-failure-58-percent-of-the-jobs-being-created-are-low-paying-jobs">58 percent</a> of the jobs that have been created since the end of the recession have been low paying jobs.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> Back in 2007, about <a title="28 percent" href="http://www.workingpoorfamilies.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Winter-2012_2013-WPFP-Data-Brief.pdf" target="_blank">28 percent</a> of all working families were considered to be among &#8220;the working poor&#8221;.  Today, that number is up to <a title="32 percent" href="http://www.workingpoorfamilies.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Winter-2012_2013-WPFP-Data-Brief.pdf" target="_blank">32 percent</a> even though our politicians tell us that the economy is supposedly recovering.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, <a title="only 24.6 percent" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/only-24-6-percent-of-all-jobs-in-the-united-states-are-good-jobs" target="_blank">only 24.6 percent</a> of all of the jobs in the United States are &#8220;good jobs&#8221; at this point.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> According <a title="to the U.S. Census Bureau" href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-09-12/business/35496368_1_income-inequality-median-household-income-middle-class" target="_blank">to the U.S. Census Bureau</a>, the middle class is taking home a smaller share of the overall income pie than has ever been recorded before.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> According to the Economic Policy Institute, the United States is losing<a title="half a million jobs" href="http://economyincrisis.org/content/trade-deficit-china-could-cost-half-million-jobs" target="_blank">half a million jobs</a> to China every single year.</p>
<p><strong>18.</strong> The United States has fallen in the global economic competitiveness rankings compiled by the World Economic Forum <a title="for four years in a row" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/a-look-behind-the-u-s-decline-in-global-competitiveness/" target="_blank">for four years in a row</a>.</p>
<p><strong>19.</strong> According to the World Bank, U.S. GDP accounted for <a title="31.8 percent" href="http://acrossthestreetnet.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/the-cost-of-kidding-yourself/" target="_blank">31.8 percent</a>of all global economic activity in 2001.  That number declined steadily over the course of the next decade and was only at <a title="21.6 percent" href="http://acrossthestreetnet.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/the-cost-of-kidding-yourself/" target="_blank">21.6 percent</a> in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>20.</strong> The United States actually has <a title="plenty of oil" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-united-states-has-plenty-of-oil-10-facts-about-americas-energy-resources-that-will-blow-your-mind" target="_blank">plenty of oil</a> and we should not have to import oil from the Middle East.  We need to drill for more oil, but Obama has been very hesitant to do that.  Under Bill Clinton, the number of drilling permits approved rose by 58 percent.  Under George W. Bush, the number of drilling permits approved rose by 116 percent.  Under Barack Obama, the number of drilling permits approved actually<strong>decreased</strong> by <a title="36 percent" href="http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/03/22/graphic-of-the-day-drilling-permits-down-36-under-obama-administration/" target="_blank">36 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>21.</strong> When Barack Obama took office, the average price of a gallon of gasoline was $1.84.  Today, the average price of a gallon of gasoline is<a title="$3.26" href="http://gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx" target="_blank">$3.26</a>.</p>
<p><strong>22.</strong> Under Barack Obama, the United States has lost <a title="more than 300,000 education jobs" href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/08/20/257171/us-cuts-300000-education-jobs/#.UDP9b6PN2Q5" target="_blank">more than 300,000 education jobs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>23.</strong> For the first time ever, <a title="more than a million" href="http://www.nlchp.org/view_release.cfm?PRID=148" target="_blank">more than a million</a> public school students in the United States are homeless.  That number has risen by <a title="57 percent" href="http://www.nlchp.org/view_release.cfm?PRID=148" target="_blank">57 percent</a> since the 2006-2007 school year.</p>
<p><strong>24.</strong> Families that have a head of household under the age of 30 now have a poverty rate <a title="of 37 percent" href="http://lrfuller.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/the-generation-that-never-stood-a-chance/" target="_blank">of 37 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>25.</strong> More than three times as many new homes were sold in the United States <a title="in 2005" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/HSN1FNSA" target="_blank">in 2005</a> as were sold in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>26.</strong> Electricity bills in the United States have risen faster than the overall rate of inflation <a title="for five years in a row" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/story/2011-12-13/electric-bills/51840042/1?loc=interstitialskip" target="_blank">for five years in a row</a>.</p>
<p><strong>27.</strong> Health insurance costs have risen <a title="by 23 percent" href="http://republican.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/our-view?ID=e33a7a58-66d2-4491-91f6-aae703cdb370" target="_blank">by 29 percent</a> since Barack Obama became president.</p>
<p><strong>28.</strong> Today, 77 percent of all Americans <a title="live paycheck to paycheck" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/77-percent-of-all-americans-live-paycheck-to-paycheck-at-least-part-of-the-time" target="_blank">live paycheck to paycheck</a> at least part of the time.</p>
<p><strong>29.</strong> It is being projected that Obamacare will add <a title="16 million more Americans" href="http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=598993&amp;ibdbot=1&amp;p=2" target="_blank">16 million more Americans</a> to the Medicaid rolls.</p>
<p><strong>30.</strong> The total amount of money that the federal government gives directly to the American people has grown <a title="by 32 percent" href="http://news.investors.com/Article/598993/201201260805/entitlements-soar-under-president-obama.htm" target="_blank">by 32 percent</a> since Barack Obama became president.</p>
<p><strong>31.</strong> The Obama administration has been spending money on some of the most insane things imaginable.  For example, in 2011 the Obama administration spent <a title="$592,527" href="http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=b69a6ebd-7ebe-41b7-bb03-c25a5e194365" target="_blank">$592,527</a> on a study that sought to figure out once and for all why chimpanzees throw poop.</p>
<p><strong>32.</strong> U.S. taxpayers spend <a title="more than 20 times as much" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/us-taxpayers-spent-1-4-billion-on-the-obamas-in-2012-british-taxpayers-only-spent-57-8-million-on-the-entire-royal-family" target="_blank">more than 20 times as much</a> on the Obamas as British taxpayers spend on the royal family.</p>
<p><strong>33.</strong> The U.S. government has run a budget deficit of well over a trillion dollars <a title="every single year" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/story/2012-07-12/federal-budget-deficit/56173002/1" target="_blank">every single year</a> under Barack Obama.</p>
<p><strong>34.</strong> When Barack Obama was first elected, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio was <a title="under 70 percent" href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-debt-to-gdp" target="_blank">under 70 percent</a>.  Today, it is up to <a title="103 percent" href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-debt-to-gdp" target="_blank">103 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>35. </strong>During Obama&#8217;s first term, the federal government accumulated more debt than it did under <a title="the first 42 U.S presidents combined" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/first-term-obama-increased-debt-50521-household-more-first-42-presidents-53-terms" target="_blank">the first 42 U.S presidents combined</a>.</p>
<p><strong>36.</strong> As I wrote about <a title="yesterday" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-sovereign-debt-bubble-will-continue-to-expand-until-bang-the-system-implodes">yesterday</a>, when you break it down the amount of new debt accumulated by the U.S. government during Obama&#8217;s first term comes to approximately <a title="$50,521" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/first-term-obama-increased-debt-50521-household-more-first-42-presidents-53-terms" target="_blank">$50,521</a> for every single household in the United States.  Are you ready to contribute your share?</p>
<p><strong>37.</strong> If you started paying off just the new debt that the U.S. has accumulated during the Obama administration at the rate of one dollar per second, it would take more than 184,000 years to pay it off.</p>
<p>But despite all of these numbers, the mainstream media and the left just continue to shower Barack Obama with worship and praise.  Newsweek recently heralded Obama&#8217;s second term as &#8220;<a title="The Second Coming" href="http://lonelyconservative.com/2013/01/newsweek-inauguration-special-the-second-coming-of-obama/" target="_blank">The Second Coming</a>&#8220;, and <a title="at Obama's pre-inauguration church service" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/20/Obama-service-Moses-enemies" target="_blank">at Obama&#8217;s pre-inauguration church service</a> Reverand Ronald Braxton openly compared Obama to Moses&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>At Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, Braxton <a title="reportedly" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/liveblog/wp/2013/01/20/liveblogging-the-inauguration/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost#liveblog-entry-8229" target="_blank">reportedly</a> crafted his speech around Obama’s personal political slogan: “Forward!”</p>
<p>Obama, said Braxton, was just like Moses facing the Red Sea: “forward is the only option … The people couldn’t turn around. The only thing that they could do was to go forward.” Obama, said Braxton, would have to overcome all obstacles – like opposition from Republicans, presumably, or the bounds of the Constitution. Braxton continued, “Mr. President, stand on the rock,” citing to Moses standing on Mount Horeb as his people camped outside the land of Israel.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t enough to compare Obama with the founder of Judaism and the prophet of the Bible. Braxton added that Obama’s opponents were like the Biblical enemies of Moses, and that Obama would have to enter the battle because “sometimes enemies insist on doing it the hard way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So what do you think the next four years of Obama will bring?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/foodstamps-03.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/foodstamps-02.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>As of November of 2012, a mind-numbing 47.7 million Americans subsist on taxpayer-funded food stamps.  One in seven Americans cannot feed himself or herself with a job or work of any kind.  What constitutes the irony to this national tragedy?  Answer: our U.S. Congress imports 100,000 legal immigrants into the USA with green cards every 30 days.</p>
<p>No matter how much poverty and unemployment blacks, whites and Hispanic Americans suffer&#8211; the leaders of this country continually pound more humans into the mix without pause.  At the same time, food banks go belly up with bare shelves. Over 13 million American children live in destitute poverty and cannot secure three square meals per day.</p>
<p>While Congress supports our enormous military spending into the trillions of dollars and two 10 year long wars that devour (ed) money—it fails to create jobs and feed our poorest.  It fails the fundamental rights of our own citizens to work and eat.</p>
<p><strong>The gross statistics created by our U.S. Congress:  (Source:<a href="http://hubpages.com/" target="_blank">hubpages.com</a>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> According <a title="to one calculation" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/11/23/Exclusive-Food-Stamp-Recipients-Outnumber-Populations-Of-24-States-Combined" target="_blank">to one calculation</a>, the number of Americans on food stamps now exceeds the combined populations of &#8220;Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> In October 2008, <a title="30.8 million Americans" href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34snapmonthly.htm" target="_blank">30.8 million Americans</a> were on food stamps. By August 2012 that number had risen to <a title="47.1 million Americans" href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34snapmonthly.htm" target="_blank">47.1 million Americans</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> Right now, one out of every seven Americans is on food stamps and <a title="one out of every four" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/us/29foodstamps.html" target="_blank">one out of every four</a> American children is on food stamps.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> It is projected that <a title="half of all American children" href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=382364" target="_blank">half of all American children</a> will be on food stamps at least once before they turn 18 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> According to new numbers that were just released by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans living in poverty increased to a new all-time record high of <a title="49.7 million" href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/11/15/census-u-s-poverty-rate-spikes-nearly-50-million-americans-affected/" target="_blank">49.7 million</a> last year.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> The number of Americans living in poverty has increased by about <a title="6 million" href="http://thetruthwins.com/archives/84-statistics-that-prove-that-the-decline-of-the-middle-class-is-real-and-that-it-is-getting-worse" target="_blank">6 million</a> over the past four years.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong>Today, about <a title="one out of every four" href="http://www.heartlandalliance.org/whatwedo/advocacy/reports/causes-of-poverty.pdf" target="_blank">one out of every four</a> workers in the United States brings home wages that are at or below the federal poverty level.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate for children living in the United States is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/child-poverty-census_n_1878834.html" target="_blank">about 22 percent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> Overall, approximately <a title="57 percent" href="http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/12/15/9461848-dismal-prospects-1-in-2-americans-are-now-poor-or-low-income" target="_blank">57 percent</a> of all children in the United States are living in homes that are either considered to be either &#8220;low income&#8221; or impoverished.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> In the United States today, close to <a title="100 million Americans" href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/its-spreading-us-census-reports-nearly-100-million-poor-in-america-worst-conditions-in-fifty-years_07232012" target="_blank">100 million Americans</a> are considered to be either &#8220;poor&#8221; or &#8220;near poor&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> One university study estimates that child poverty costs the U.S. economy <a title="500 billion dollars" href="http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/dps/pdfs/dp132707.pdf" target="_blank">500 billion dollars</a> each year.</p>
<p><strong>#12</strong> Households that are led by a single mother have a <a title="31.6%" href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/13/news/economy/poverty_rate_income/index.htm?hpt=hp_t1" target="_blank">31.6 percent</a> poverty rate.</p>
<p><strong>#13</strong> In 2010, <a title="42 percent" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2056864/Handout-nation-Food-stamp-map-America-reveals-hotspots-15-population-government-help.html" target="_blank">42 percent</a> of all single mothers in the United States were on food stamps.</p>
<p>Once you research the numbers, you cannot help but look to your own U.S. Senators and House reps and see failure, duplicity and corruption.  No excuses!  How could men and women who are supposed to represent American citizens continually leave American citizens in the grips of poverty, joblessness and homelessness?</p>
<p>Some kind of moral, ethical and spiritual wrong grows in the nation’s capitol all the way up to the president.  American citizens become its victims.</p>
<p>Do you think there is any chance of it changing and becoming better as that same U.S. Congress adds over 3.1 million immigrants every year on our way to adding 100 million immigrants within the next 38 years?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/guns-and-weed3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/guns-and-weed2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>In this column last week, I took sportscaster Bob Costas to task for his inane comments regarding the murder-suicide deaths committed by Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher. Costas ignorantly and irrationally blamed the deaths of Jovan and his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, on “our current gun culture.” Costas naively said, “If Jovan Belcher didn&#8217;t possess a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today.”</p>
<p>See my column on Bob Costas at:</p>
<p><a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=16402" target="_blank">http://veracityvoice.com/?p=16402</a></p>
<p>Well, here is another tragic story of an NFL player’s untimely death. This time the team is the Dallas Cowboys. USA Today covers the story:</p>
<p>“For the second time in a week, from one Saturday to the next, another young professional football player is dead at the age of 25 and another NFL team is grieving after allegations of a terrible and tragic crime.</p>
<p>“Last weekend, it was Kansas City. This weekend, it&#8217;s Dallas. The circumstances are different, but the results are eerily similar. Two players are gone: One by his own hand in front of his coach and general manager in the parking lot of the team&#8217;s practice facility; the second in the morgue after a night out with a teammate, who is now sitting in an Irving, Tex., jail cell while his teammates fly to Cincinnati for Sunday&#8217;s game.</p>
<p>“One week after Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher killed the mother of his nearly 3-month-old daughter and then killed himself, the Cowboys are mourning the loss of a teammate while another has been arrested for intoxication manslaughter.</p>
<p>“Nose tackle Josh Brent, who was to have started this Sunday against the Bengals, was arrested early Saturday morning after the car he was driving flipped over, killing his lone passenger, Cowboys practice-squad player Jerry Brown, who was Brent&#8217;s teammate not only in Dallas but also at the University of Illinois from 2007-09.”</p>
<p>See the report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ajh9jkv" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/ajh9jkv</a></p>
<p>So, why didn’t Bob Costas get on national television and say, “If Josh Brent didn&#8217;t possess a car, Jerry Brown would be alive today”? Why? Because Bob Costas doesn’t think critically, that’s why! He simply regurgitates the same antiquated anti-gun rhetoric he hears from his pro-gun-control buddies.</p>
<p>But it’s true: if the gun is to blame for Belcher and Perkins’ deaths, the car is to blame for Brown’s death.</p>
<p>And speaking of cars and guns, the total number of deaths nationwide from the misuse of firearms pales in comparison to the total number of deaths from the misuse of automobiles. Yet, I don’t hear the Bob Costases of the world screaming for “automobile-control.” Come on, folks, get real! Plus, as Larry Pratt and others have already noted, firearms in the possession of American citizens are actually used to protect the lives of people some 4,000 to 6,000 times A DAY. When Costas said, “Handguns do not enhance our safety,” not only was he wrong, he was miserably wrong! Handguns DO enhance our safety&#8211;not to mention our liberty!</p>
<p>Look at the city of Chicago. More people have been murdered in the city of Chicago this year than soldiers killed in Afghanistan. One hundred and forty-four US troops have been killed in Afghanistan so far in 2012, while 228 people have been murdered so far in 2012 in The Windy City.</p>
<p>According to The Huffington Post, “The war zone-like statistics are not new. As WBEZ reports, while some 2,000 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, more than 5,000 people have been killed by gun fire in Chicago during that time, based on Department of Defense and FBI data.”</p>
<p>See the report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/16/chicago-homicide-rate-wor_n_1602692.html" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/<wbr></wbr>2012/06/16/chicago-homicide-<wbr></wbr>rate-wor_n_1602692.html</a></p>
<p>Yet, Chicago, Illinois, has some of the strictest gun-control laws in America. Then again, maybe that’s one of the reasons why so many people are killed in Chicago. The laws of this city forbid honest citizens from being armed and, thus, they are unable to defend themselves. Let the good guys start shooting back and one will see a dramatic lapse of courage among miscreants. Don’t believe that? Check out the violent crime rates in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, or Vermont.</p>
<p>This modern infatuation with blaming inanimate objects for acts of immorality and impropriety is nothing short of epidemic! Of course, the reason for this madness is it facilitates the expansion of government into the minutest details of our lives. Big-Government zealots have an innate fear of power and responsibility resting in individuals. They see government as the only suitable source of power. To big-government toadies, individuals are merely the property of government. To them, government bureaucrats can do nothing wrong, while individual citizens can do nothing right. Hence, to big-government hacks, only government officials have the right to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p>The same reasoning applies to America’s so-called “War on Drugs.” Marijuana, especially, is blamed for all kinds of immoral and unsavory conduct, even though the overwhelming evidence simply does not support the accusation.</p>
<p>My youngest son, Timothy, is a former Florida Assistant State Attorney who is now in private practice. Regarding marijuana as being a source of criminal conduct, he wrote, “Drawing from my own personal experience, I see the absurdity of the ‘war on marijuana.’ During my time as a prosecutor at the Florida State Attorney’s Office from 2004 to 2006 where I handled literally thousands of criminal cases and tried nearly 60 jury trials, I was never impressed that marijuana was the cause of any criminal activity. Oh sure, possession of marijuana charges comprised a large number of my criminal cases; but the criminal act was merely the man-made law of possession of marijuana. In fact, most criminal activities were in large part caused by alcohol, where one who consumed too much alcohol became violent; beat his wife; neglected his children; drove drunk and hurt someone; caused a disturbance of the peace; or other similar evils.</p>
<p>“I saw those alcohol-related cases every day. Yet, I cannot say the same regarding marijuana. I would estimate that of the thousands of cases I handled, at least half (if not more) were a direct cause of alcohol consumption or addiction. Yet, alcohol is legal and marijuana is illegal.”</p>
<p>See Tim’s column at:</p>
<p><a href="http://newswithviews.com/Timothy/baldwin159.htm" target="_blank">http://newswithviews.com/<wbr></wbr>Timothy/baldwin159.htm</a></p>
<p>In fact, marijuana was not even considered harmful or illegal in the United States until 1937, as Tim pointed out in his column. Most people would probably be surprised to learn that four out of our first five presidents not only promoted the use of the hemp plant, but also grew it. Can one imagine putting George Washington or Thomas Jefferson in jail for growing what we now call marijuana? Egad!</p>
<p>The idea that the use of marijuana is harmful because “it leads to hard drugs” is tantamount to saying that beer is harmful because “it leads to hard liquor.” But it’s just not true! There are tens of millions of people who drink responsibly, or who use alcohol medicinally (as prescribed even by Holy Scripture), who never become alcoholics. Likewise, there are tens of millions of marijuana users who use it responsibly or medicinally, who never go on to use hard drugs or become drug addicts. And when it comes to addictions, Americans’ addiction to sugar and laziness kills far more people than those addicted to alcohol&#8211;or even tobacco for that matter.</p>
<p>But by making marijuana responsible for all kinds of untoward behavior, and by ignoring the personal accountability of people to behave responsibly, it has helped provide the justification for government to trample the Bill of Rights and create huge bureaucracies, which swell the size and scope of government&#8211;especially the federal government.</p>
<p>The same is true for firearms. By making guns responsible for all kinds of untoward behavior, and by ignoring the personal accountability of people to behave responsibly, it helps provide the justification for government to trample the Bill of Rights (in this case the Second Amendment) and create huge bureaucracies (the ATF among others), which swell the size and scope of government&#8211;especially the federal government.</p>
<p>Marijuana is a convenient scapegoat. Firearms are a convenient scapegoat. Automobiles, on the other hand, are not so convenient! Hence, we hear nothing from Bob Costas about the need for more “automobile-control.” Plus, amazingly enough, neither did Costas say a word about bringing back Prohibition! In Costas’ world, only guns are sufficiently evil enough to warrant his righteous indignation.</p>
<p>The tragedies in Kansas City and Dallas cause all people of good will to grieve. We grieve for the people involved; we grieve for the families of the victims; and we grieve for the NFL players, coaches, and management. But what we must not do is use these tragedies as an excuse to justify and condone the suppression of our God-given liberties! In addition, it’s past time for America, at every level, to start re-emphasizing the primacy of personal responsibility. That’s something that isn’t being taught much in our nation’s schools, churches, or even families.</p>
<p>But the promotion and expectation of personal responsibility is what made America great; and it’s also what provides our nation with its liberties. If men cannot be expected to be accountable for their conduct, they can hardly be expected to be accountable for their freedom. This is why inanimate objects are used as scapegoats by big-government toadies: it diminishes the virtue of individualism and extols the necessity of governmentism.</p>
<p>In Kansas City, the problem was not the gun; the problem was Belcher. And in Dallas, the problem was not the car&#8211;or even the booze&#8211;the problem was Brent. Straighten out the man and one will have no need to worry about the objects that are at his disposal.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.profitconfidential.com/gold-investments/13-states-now-considering-gold-and-silver-as-money/"><img title="Gold and Silver as Money" src="http://media.profitconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/michael_lombardi_190712.jpg?9707a5" alt="Gold and Silver as Money" width="172" height="150" /></a>When the governor of Utah signed a bill that made <a href="http://www.profitconfidential.com/gold-bullion/" target="_blank">gold bullion</a> and silver bullion legal tender in the state last March, he had no idea of the groundswell he was going to start.</p>
<p>The <em>Utah Sound Money Act</em> outright flies in the face of the fiat money system, which is the printed money used today; backed by nothing but the promises of politicians. While U.S. states cannot create their own currency under the Constitution, they are allowed to use gold bullion and <a href="http://www.profitconfidential.com/silver/" target="_blank">silver</a> bullion as legal tender. More and more states are now exercising that right.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Utah, when they studied history, found that every single instance of money printing and massive increases in a country’s debt always led to the destruction of the currency and a depression among the citizens that lived through it.</p>
<p>They were concerned about the Fed’s money printing and massive government debt accumulation and thus signed into law the <em>Utah Sound Money Act</em>, which recognized gold bullion and silver bullion as currency. They felt that the U.S. dollar would continue to lose its value, while gold bullion and silver bullion would continue to maintain their value, because they are sound currencies with no debts attached to them.</p>
<p>The Utah law states that the gold bullion and silver bullion coins issued by the U.S. Mint can be used as payment with any merchant in the State of Utah for the purchase of all goods and services.</p>
<p>It is not practical for people to carry around heavy gold bullion or silver bullion coins, so the Utah Gold &amp; Silver Depository was created. People can deposit their gold bullion and silver bullion coins there and receive a debit card to make transactions with—just like depositing money at a bank. The prices of gold bullion and silver bullion are based on the closing prices of both precious metals in U.S. dollars in London on each business day, creating the exchange rate used on the debit card.</p>
<p>Missouri and South Carolina in 2012 are the closest to enacting very similar legislation and creating a gold bullion and silver bullion depository, just like Utah. (Source: CNN Money, February 3, 2012.) Both states echo the same sentiments as Utah and this is evident by the names chosen for the bills. For example, in Missouri, the legislation put forth is called the <em>Missouri Sound Money Act of 2012</em>.</p>
<p>Other states considering legislation to make gold bullion and silver bullion legal tender are Montana, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, New Hampshire, Georgia, Washington, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Virginia.</p>
<p>This may seem strange, dear reader, but cultures in Asia would not be surprised, considering that gold bullion and silver bullion have been considered money for 5,000 years there. Also, people forget that, until 1971, the U.S. dollar was backed by gold bullion.</p>
<p>The distrust of the money printing being enacted by the Federal Reserve and the unprecedented debts being accumulated by the U.S. government, which are increasing by at least $1.0 trillion per year, are being questioned.</p>
<p>States are fighting back with what they believe are sound money policies: gold bullion and silver bullion. We should heed their example as a warning of what’s to come.

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ronpaulfinale3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/ronpaulfinale2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Believe it or not, I was thinking that my column of two weeks ago was my last column in which I would focus on Congressman Ron Paul–that was before the Republican National Convention in Tampa took place. I have never seen such a disgusting display of chicanery and duplicity in all of my life. So, in spite of the fact that I have written so much about The Greatest Congressman In US History (my title for Ron Paul), here I go again.</p>
<p>First, a report on Paul Fest: I was honored to be one of the featured speakers for the event, which drew thousands of Ron Paul supporters from all over the country. I was able to meet and speak with hundreds of these wonderful people, as they came up to me before and after I spoke.</p>
<p>Not only was I surprised at how many of these people read this column, but how many are watching our Sunday services that we livestream each Sunday afternoon. I am convinced that there are hundreds of thousands of patriot Christians who are fed up with mainstream churches and pastors, who are hungering and thirsting for patriot pastors who know what’s going on and are not afraid to speak the truth. Not able to find such pastors where they live, they are tuning in to our services on the Internet.</p>
<p>The service at Liberty Fellowship is broadcast live each Sunday at approximately 2:30pm Mountain Time. To access the service live this Sunday, go to:</p>

<p>Next, the thought of Ron Paul no longer being our champion on Capitol Hill is extremely disconcerting! There is sadness in my heart at Dr. Paul’s departure from Congress that I don’t think I’ve ever felt. The only instance I can think of that comes close is when Helen Chenoweth of Idaho term-limited herself in order to fulfill her word of honor to her constituents. (It was even sadder to hear of her untimely death a few years ago.) But Dr. Paul’s absence in Congress will leave a void that is difficult to describe. Suffice it to say, as Congress is currently comprised, there is no one on Capitol Hill who comes close to taking his place. But it is the way that this champion of liberty was treated by the GOP establishment that has my blood boiling!</p>
<p>Anyone who has paid any attention to what the Republican Party has done to Ron Paul and his supporters must be thoroughly outraged at the injustice and injurious treatment inflicted, not only upon Ron and his followers, but also upon the integrity of a free and fair political process. In short, we don’t have a free and fair political process in America anymore! What we have is a Soviet-style political apparatus that thrives on manipulation, intimidation, and downright dishonesty.</p>
<p>The RNC was so blatantly manipulative and crooked that the Republican governor of Maine, Paul LePage, justifiably boycotted the convention–and the Maine Ron Paul delegation understandably all left in protest. The video tribute the RNC played at the convention in honor of Congressman Paul (while very good as far as it went) was shown in an attempt to placate Ron’s millions of supporters. However, in actuality it was the height of hypocrisy, as the RNC had pulled out every underhanded and unethical trick in the book in order to make sure that Ron Paul was never given a chance to prevail as the Republican nominee for President. Of course, the national propaganda press corps was a willing accomplice to the RNC destruction of Ron’s campaign.</p>
<p>But the establishment’s ultimate insult to the twelve-term congressman occurred as Ron Paul and his wife tried to leave Tampa using a private plane. Lew Rockwell posted this: “Ron, Carol, and one of their granddaughters left the GOP snake pit yesterday afternoon, but the State was not yet through with them. At the little airport in Clearwater, 8 TSA agents descended on them and ordered them not to board their private plane. First, the pilots, the airplane, and the passengers would have to be screened in great detail, because Romney might be nearby. After a long examination of the pilots and their credentials, the agents said they had to check the plane for explosives. One of the pilots noted that the plane, full of gas, was already a bomb. Then Carol Paul, who has a heart pacemaker, refused to be screened, and an aide started taking video of the whole rotten proceeding. At that point, the TSA backed down and let them through.”</p>
<p>Such is the way a totalitarian-state-in-the-making treats a 76-year-old congressman with more than two decades of seniority and three-time candidate for President of the United States! Welcome to the United Soviet Socialist America!</p>
<p>Now, with millions of so-called Christians and conservatives lining up in support of the phony conservative Mitt Romney, the American people are once again left with the choice of Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dum. No, I don’t buy the “anybody-but-Obama” mantra, either! In many ways, an unprincipled, compromising pseudo-conservative Republican is worse than an obviously liberal Democrat. The patriots of 1776 had far more to fear from Benedict Arnold than they did King George. An enemy easily identified is much less formidable than one who marches in the uniform of an ally.</p>
<p>That being said, where do we go from here?</p>
<p>Regardless who is elected President in November, nothing will be done to stop, or even slow down, America’s lust for foreign entanglements and wars. And that means nothing will be done to stop or slow down the burgeoning police state that is enveloping our nation. By 2016, there won’t be many liberties left in this country, regardless which party captures the White House. That is an absolute certainty! With the approbation and blessing of both Romney and Obama, the police and warfare states–not to mention the size and growth of government–will continue to accelerate at an unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>At this point, I am going to borrow from notable researcher and analyst Joel Skousen. In my opinion, his analysis regarding the “Where are we going” question is absolutely spot on. Here I share with readers Skousen’s sagacity. My condensed version of his comments follows.</p>
<p>“1) The [American] people are no longer worthy of liberty. Americans as a whole are soft, materialistic and too content with life to fight, let alone recognize the loss of liberty. As long as they are allowed to go to church and buy what they want, they think they are free. But the noose is tightening. The youth are even softer, so the trend is in the wrong direction. Americans may still consider themselves a religious people, but religion, for the most part, doesn’t change their little bad habits, so at some point their religion is not leading to righteousness. They stop listening to the refining voice of conscience. Religious people don’t even honor the Sabbath anymore.</p>
<p>“To the Lord, listening to the personal promptings of conscience is where the real test of religiosity lies and most Christians are chronic violators of conscience in the ‘little things’ relative to weight control, nutrition, recreation choices, use of time and failure to discipline children. Trouble is, this callous disregard for the ‘still small voice’ leads to bigger problems and worse decisions. That is why immorality and divorce are high even among church goers. There are notable exceptions, but in general America is getting more unworthy to be saved by God.</p>
<p>“2) Americans are lazy about finding truth. Today, more than ever with the vast information on the web, the truth is out there (except for most of the deepest and darkest secrets of conspiracy), and if people don’t find it, something is wrong with them relative to the workings of conscience and self control. That’s my point. Far too many people have become immune to the faint warning signals that something is wrong, or if they do hear it, they are too busy searching for material welfare to care.</p>
<p>“[3] States have become corrupt too: It is only partially true that state and local governments are easier to reform than the federal government. All state governments have corruption problems and some states like California, Illinois and New York have corruption machines that rival the mafia. Most large cities are also totally corrupt inside. That said, some states are clearly less corrupt than others, but there is an establishment good ‘old boy network, closely allied with the liberal press in every major city that works together to make sure than no Ron Paul or free market revolutionary gains control.</p>
<p>“What about the God is in Control argument? Optimistic Christian conservatives always throw out the argument that ‘God is in Control’ and so we don’t have to worry. He has the power to change things. As a believer, I agree. He does have the power. But the real question is will He intervene to save us? And, is America worthy of being saved by God? I don’t think so anymore. That doesn’t mean all is lost for everyone, but it does point to us heading for a great period of tribulation and the loss of liberty at the national level as it morphs into the NWO. I’m a religious person, and keep my eyes open constantly searching for signs that God is intervening as he did in the nation’s founding– allowing a set of leaders to rise to positions of influence where they can turn the tide, or even allowing major financing to come to principled people so they can bypass the establishment media, or schools, and fund a national movement to renew America. Nothing has happened. The big money only goes to ineffective or mainstream causes. We do have ample numbers of great thinkers with ideals and principles as profound as America’s founders, but none have been allowed to rise in power. Ron Paul got the closest. Those ministers who have achieved great wealth and fame in televangelism have done so by singing the easy gospel that people want to hear. Those that have been granted access to the White House prayer breakfast meetings during the Bush administration were those who refused to speak up or criticize the big government or war agenda. All the real champions of freedom have been left on the sidelines. Ron Paul is the only one to even get close to a run at the presidency and he has been shut down–but not without building the movement. I’ve seen God’s hand helping to gather the remnant, but no indications of any real optimism toward beating the mammoth evil that is growing even faster than the Liberty Movement.</p>
<p>“Considering the overwhelming moral evil in our nation that burdens the Lord’s sense of justice, I think He is bound to let the sword of justice fall. You can’t just manufacture specific faith in a proposed event by hope only or wishful thinking. For specific faith in a hoped for event to be valid, you have to have the spiritual confirmation that it is the Lord’s will, and that must come from God and not rosy-eyed optimism. While the Lord might certainly want the nation to be saved, God himself cannot arbitrarily disregard the decree of justice upon which the universe operates. Only upon terms of repentance and change of heart can condemnation be averted, and I don’t see that happening. I’m keeping an open heart and mind that it might, but the signs aren’t good.”</p>
<p>But it is Skousen’s conclusion that truly speaks to my heart. He writes:</p>
<p>“We can still fight for liberty to gain a minority foothold within the nation–a resistance movement, if you will, even if we can’t win back the whole. But when you are dealing with a minority of good people, to exercise any power at all, you have to congregate together so that you have a majority in a region or local area. Our greatest problem in a losing battle of attrition is that we are spread out uniformly across the nation–dispersed in a sea of humanity where none of us constitute a majority.</p>
<p>“If there is any hope for liberty it will be because pockets of liberty and resistance form during the next war when government itself is busy saving itself and not targeting freedom-loving dissidents–yet. I think you’ll see the time, when crisis comes that the social unrest will drive people out of their current places and the Lord will inspire those who can listen to go to places of refuge where other like-minded people are also gathering. Some will be inspired to go to safe places before the crisis, and if you are one of those, heed the promptings.”</p>
<p>My take differs only slightly from Skousen’s: I believe when the crisis comes, people will not be able to relocate, which is why the Lord is inspiring people to relocate NOW, and why the gathering of eagles is already taking place here in Montana’s Flathead Valley and in other places.</p>

<p>If my understanding of scriptures is close to accurate, one of the signs that God is giving a nation or people over to judgment is a dearth of principled leadership. Ron Paul’s departure from Congress–along with the way the Republican Party, the national media, and the American people as a whole, rejected his message of liberty and constitutional government–make it appear that judgment has already begun.</p>
