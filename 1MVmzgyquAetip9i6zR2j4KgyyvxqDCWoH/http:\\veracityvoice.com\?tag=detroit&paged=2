<p>Does anyone in the United States understand or comprehend what America will look like in 2050 “IF” we continue endless immigration into our country?  Does any leader possess an inkling of the ramifications of adding the projected 100 million immigrants, their kids and chain-migrated relatives?  </p>
<p>That’s correct, at the current rate of immigration legalized by the 1986 Reagan amnesty, we continue on course to add 100 million immigrants from all over the world.  They arrive legally at 1.0 million annually.  They birth 900,000 babies among their numbers annually. (Source: Dr. Steven Camorata, <a href="http://www.cis.org">www.cis.org</a>)  With chain migration, that means each “new” American may invite 10 of his or her relatives to join them with “family-reunification.” If the current S744 amnesty bill passes, your US Congress jumped that 1.0 million to 2.0 million legal immigrants annually. </p>
<p>Do the math!  Any way you cut it, that means America will experience an avalanche, a human tsunami, or simply the biggest wave of humanity ever to hit our country or any country, ever.  We will grow from our current 316 million to well over 438 million people within 37 years.  The extra 38 million will come from our own “population momentum.”  These figures stem from our country reaching 300 million in October of 2007.  We grow by 3.1 million annually.</p>
<p>What’s it going to look like?  Answer: it will become ugly on multiple levels—environmentally, sociologically, linguistically, culturally, quality of life and downgraded standard of living—for starters. Parts 1 through 5 will cover what we face.</p>
<p>First of all, 100 million immigrants will equal our adding 20 of our most populated cities.  Think of it: we will add another New York City, Detroit, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and eight other American cities.</p>
<p>We face watering 100 million more people, housing them, transporting them, warming them, feeding them and finding jobs for them. </p>
<p>Today in 2013, seven states face shortages: Georgia, Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California.  But Georgia will grow from 8.2 million to 16.4 million.  Florida expects to grow from 18 million to 36 million.  For the whopper fact of all, California expects to jump from 38 million to 58 million.</p>
<p>Our cities face resembling present-day Mumbai, India; or Tokyo, Japan; or Paris, France; or Shanghai, China—bursting at the seams with 50 to100 mile traffic jams, people smooched into 200 square foot apartments rising out of the ground like mindless stalactites. </p>
<p>Our rivers will run with endless chemicals from industrial, farm, human and acid rain pollution.  Our National Parks will become so crowded that you will be forced to draw a lottery number in order to visit them.</p>
<p>Every last bit of arable land and wildreness will be destroyed by what scientists call “ecological footprint.”  In Ethiopia, it takes .4 (4/10ths) of an acre of land to feed, water and house a person. In the USA, it takes 25.4 acres of land to support one person.  (Source:<a href="http://www.allspecis.org">www.allspecis.org</a>)  </p>
<p>With those 100 million immigrants, we must destroy 2.54 BILLION acres of land.  That, in turn, guarantees accelerating our current 250 species suffering extinction annually in the lower 48 to double that number which will mean 5,000 species a year suffering extinction at the hands of our encroachment on the natural world.</p>
<p>As those enormous human numbers impact the carbon footprint and impact the “water footprint”, we face water predicament that will become unsolvable and irreversible.  We face water wars, water confrontations, water irrigation problems heretofore never imagined. </p>
<p>Our giant aquifers like the Ogallala will dry up leaving us with no irrigation of our corn, wheat and hay fields. </p>
<p>We incorporate a Faustian Bargain in 2013 to reap a Hobson’s Choice in 2050—a scant 37 years from now.</p>
<p>Our quality of life cannot help but degrade into severe limitations as to hunting, fishing, wildlife extermination, energy exhaustion and resource depletion.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about energy:  we hit Peak Oil in 2011. We face the last 50 percent of all oil remaining on the planet.  It takes more energy units to pump it and less energy units out of the ground.  Finally, at some point, we will be left with little oil at staggering prices—but a 438 million population to feed.  Of sobering note, the world will have added 3.1 billion humans to feed, to this nightmare extends beyond our borders.</p>
<p>How about the environment?  Anybody want to guess how much damage our carbon footprint will wreak havoc on our oceans with acidification and warming of the waters?  My guess: we face annual Hurricane Sandy’s and Katrina’s.  More tornadoes will mow humans down at an outstanding rate.</p>
<p>Additionally: I’ve only covered the tip of the iceberg of what we bequeath to our children.</p>
<p>As I sit here with the scientific facts, my own world travels having seen the 12 largest cities on the planet and my own scientific experiences in Antarctica—I am appalled that the American people and our leaders gallop into this added 100 million more immigrants without so much as a shout, whimper or cry.</p>
<p>Our kids will curse our stupidity, arrogance and outright disregard for their futures.  My own two U.S. Senators understand what we face because I spent 45 minutes explaining the facts to their staffs, but they voted to add 2.0 million legal immigrants annually to make our fate arrive even faster than 37 years.</p>
<p>My guess: our leaders resemble intellectual lunatics.  Our people resemble the dumbest sheep on the planet. </p>
<p>Finally, why am I one of the few Americans who “sees” this so clearly?  Why aren’t there tens of millions of Americans who “see” and take it to “60 Minutes” ; “Charlie Rose” ; “Today Show” ; “DateLine” ; “Good Morning America” ;  Scott Pelley, Diane Sawyer, Brian Williams, Wolf Blitzer, Kelly Mygen, Shepard Smith and every other media leader?  Why don’t we demand a national discussion?</p>
<p>If we refuse to act, remain too apathetic to act, or don’t act—the S744 Amnesty Bill will pass and add that 100 million immigrants to this country in a blink of time.  God help our children when they inherit our legacy of 100 million immigrants.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1965, the United States demographic consisted of 90 percent European-Americans, 7 percent African-Americans and 3 percent Latino-Hispanic-Americans.</p>
<p>At that time, everyone considered themselves “Americans” in the “Melting Pot” of the great American experiment of a constitutional republic.</p>
<p>As with every mixed racial and ethnic country in the world—racism, discrimination and prejudice flourished.  ML King, Rodney King riots in LA, Detroit riots in 1968, Selma to Montgomery Freedom March, KKK and hundreds of other events took place.</p>
<p>Racial issues command front-page stories in 2013 with “Black Flash Mobs” forming and attacking white Americans.  A Latino-American killed a black American in Florida that caused tremendous unrest and demonstrations against “white” racism. (Trayvon Martin vs. George Zimmerman)  Mexican immigrants push African-Americans out of Los Angeles.  “White flight” from rapidly advancing minority populations provides TV talking heads with endless fodder for their take on racism and inequality in America.</p>
<p>White liberals with bumper stickers “Celebrate Diversity and Multiculturalism” carted their kids away from inner city schools with 20 different languages in Boulder, Colorado last fall to all white charter schools.</p>
<p>Not mentioned in the USA media: racism flourishes all over the world where different racial groups co-exist.  Mexico supports entrenched racism. Japan manifests racism by its non-immigration stance and sense of superiority over most other races.  Racism abounds in the Middle East.  Same in Africa and South America!</p>
<p>In the final analysis, racism stems from tribal-racial-cultural differences. It’s more biological than most people realize.  It flourishes in highly educated societies and expands in uneducated countries.</p>
<p>While unpleasant for decades, racism and racial inequality stand front and center in the political-public eye in America.  Racism hasn’t been stamped out no matter how many laws, forced integration, bussing, quotas, affirmative action and the like.</p>
<p>In all of this grand march, something historic happened to America in 1965 with Senator Teddy Kennedy’s Immigration Reform Act.  That single act dramatically changed America’s future from a dominant European tribe to a new majority that will become the new dominant ethnic group by 2042: Mexican-Latino-Hispanic.  (Source: PEW Research Center)</p>
<p>Within a 45-year span, Latino-Americans jumped from three percent of the population to 35 percent of the population on their way to 51 percent of the American population by 2042.  They will dominate in the four southern Border States.  They will make enormous ethnic, religious and cultural impact on all of America.</p>
<p>Today, virtually every business phone answering service offers: press “1” for Spanish, press “2” for English.  Another language expects to make its presence known as millions upon millions of Muslims enter America and force their language upon the landscape. Press “3” for Arabic already manifests in Detroit, Michigan also known as “Dearbornistan.”</p>
<p>“Islam&#8217;s borders are bloody and so are its innards. The fundamental problem for the West is not Islamic fundamentalism. It is Islam, a different civilization whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture and are obsessed with the inferiority of their power.”<br />

<p>In other words, Americans allowed themselves to be transformed into another culture, language and ethos. Or, with the next 100 million immigrants arriving by 2050—a polyglot society.</p>
<p>“The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion […] but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact; non-Westerners never do.”   <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fauthor%2Fshow%2F38041.Samuel_P_Huntington&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3-I6qJQD7x9P78iLBwOxWWkc_7w" target="_blank">Samuel P. Huntington</a>, <i><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fwork%2Fquotes%2F403464&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNg-a9RNfzykRS1TGfZiYbZ55NNA" target="_blank">The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order</a></i></p>
<p>Because conquered people don’t forget, the Mexicans now migrated into America at well over 15 million in 2013, expect to enforce their language and customs onto the American landscape.  They succeed daily.  Classrooms in southern California feature Spanish as the only spoken language.</p>
<p>As this phenomenon advances, European-Americans flee areas that become dominated by minorities.  Reverse racism advances into the workplace dominated by Mexican-Americans.  If you can’t speak Spanish, you cannot secure a job.  Where Mexican-Americans dominate in America in 2013, flunkout/dropout rates skyrocket.  Why?  Average Mexican citizens quit school by the 6<sup>th</sup> grade.  In America, their minds quit even if they must attend school to age 16.</p>
<p>Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall, and that, “An autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.”</p>
<p><b>Americans stand by while their country disintegrates into an entirely different ethnic tribe(s)</b></p>
<p>Former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm spelled out in his famous speech—How to Destroy America: “Here is how they destroyed their countries.  First, turn America into a bilingual or multi lingual and bicultural country.  History shows that no nation can survive the tension, conflict and antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures.  It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; however, it is a curse for a society to be bilingual.  The historical scholar Seymour Lipset put it this way, “The histories of bilingual and bicultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension and tragedy.  Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, and Lebanon—all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with Basques, Bretons and Corsicans.”</p>
<p>As America launches on changing its ethnic identity, culture and language—does anyone understand the new reverse racism and how it will affect blacks and whites in America?</p>
<p>Does anyone understand the ramifications of adding 100 million immigrants in three decades?   Does anyone understand what it will take to keep this civilization running with accelerating illiteracy from the new Latino-Mexican dominating tribe?  Is anyone asking how we plan to water, feed and house that 100 million new immigrants that land on America?</p>
<p>Finally, are Americans ready for a complete change in language to many languages?  Are Americans ready to become a polyglot nation that fails on multiple levels today in endless countries around the world as witnessed in Governor Lamm’s speech?</p>
<p>“It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural. Nation-states will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations. The clash of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future.”  ? <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fauthor%2Fshow%2F38041.Samuel_P_Huntington&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3-I6qJQD7x9P78iLBwOxWWkc_7w" target="_blank">Samuel P. Huntington</a></p>
<p>With the passage of the S744 amnesty bill that will add two million legal immigrants annually, we remain on course to prove historian Arnold Toynbee correct, “I have observed that all great civilizations rise and fall, and that, an autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.”</p>

				<p>October 18, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18937#respond" title="Comment on Is Secession’s Time Coming Again?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="18937 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18937">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/secession-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/secession-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Pat Buchanan recently wrote an intriguing column titled, “Is Red State America Seceding?” His column clearly reveals that an independence/secession movement is spreading globally. Pat rightly observes that in just the last few years some 25 nations have broken free of mother countries and formed their own independent states. And, no, most of these separations did NOT require violent revolution. In addition, talk of secession is currently going on in at least six other regions of the world. And, as Buchanan correctly observes, the spirit of secession is very much alive and well in the United States.</p>
<p>Buchanan writes, “The five counties of western Maryland&#8211;Garrett, Allegany, Washington, Frederick and Carroll, which have more in common with West Virginia and wish to be rid of Baltimore and free of Annapolis, are talking secession.”</p>
<p>But people in Maryland are not the only ones talking secession. Buchanan continues to write, “Ten northern counties of Colorado are this November holding non-binding referenda to prepare a future secession from Denver and the creation of America’s 51st state.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, people in northern California are also talking secession. Again, to quote Pat Buchanan: “In California, which many have long believed should be split in two, the northern counties of Modoc and Siskiyou on the Oregon border are talking secession&#8211;and then union in a new state called Jefferson.”</p>
<p>Buchanan goes on to say, “Folks on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, bordered by Wisconsin and the Great Lakes, which is connected to lower Michigan by a bridge, have long dreamed of a separate state called Superior. The UP has little in common with Lansing and nothing with Detroit.</p>
<p>“While the folks in western Maryland, northern Colorado, northern California and on the Upper Peninsula might be described as red state secessionists, in Vermont the secessionists seem of the populist left. The Montpelier Manifesto of the Second Vermont Republic concludes:</p>
<p>“‘Citizens, lend your names to this manifesto and join in the honorable task of rejecting the immoral, corrupt, decaying, dying, failing American Empire and seeking its rapid and peaceful dissolution before it takes us all down with it.’”</p>
<p>Pat concludes his column saying, “This sort of intemperate language may be found in Thomas Jefferson’s indictment of George III. If America does not get its fiscal house in order, and another Great Recession hits or our elites dragoon us into another imperial war, we will likely hear more of such talk.”</p>
<p>See Pat Buchanan’s column here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnd.com%2F2013%2F10%2Fis-red-state-america-seceding%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBvqiV5yVa3zgww_spLNUH-bIquw" target="_blank">Is Red State America Seceding?</a></p>
<p>Buchanan’s analysis is right on the money. The spirit of independence is far from dead in the United States. In fact, the spirit of independence (otherwise known as the Spirit of ’76) has already begun driving people to separate from states and cities in which they have lived for most or all of their lives. The biggest recipient of these many thousands of freedom-minded people seems to be the Rocky Mountain States of America’s Northwest.</p>
<p>Faithful readers of this column know that my entire family, including five heads of households and some 18 family members, relocated to the Flathead Valley of Montana after having lived a lifetime&#8211;or the better part of a lifetime&#8211;in the southeastern United States. And during the last three years, I have witnessed scores of families also relocate to northwestern Montana from all over the country.</p>
<p>But it’s not just Chuck Baldwin’s move or the people from around the country who have decided to join us here in the Flathead Valley: thousands of people are relocating to what is now commonly referred to as “The American Redoubt.” This area includes Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, eastern Washington State, and eastern Oregon.</p>
<p>By the way, to read a compilation of articles as to why my family and I chose the Flathead Valley of Montana to which to relocate, peruse the material here:</p>

<p>Just recently, Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) did a television report on the growing numbers of people who are relocating to The American Redoubt. See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbn.com%2Ftv%2F2742102419001&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmEnMq2hpTpw8lQ1Y_dW4cQRinLw" target="_blank">Redoubt: Northwest a Haven For Dismayed Americans</a></p>
<p>The mood all over America is one of intense uncertainty and uneasiness. More and more Americans are waking up to the reality that Washington, D.C., is hopelessly broken (financially and morally), and it’s only a matter of time before something catastrophic happens. They see the way America’s major cities are becoming more and more tyrannical and crime-infested.</p>
<p>In the major cities, public schools more and more resemble prisons; police departments more and more resemble the German Gestapo; local governments more and more try to make criminals out of honest gun owners and more and more attack the Christian values that were once revered in this country. Add any major disaster (natural or man-made) to these growing concerns and the prospect for a normal life in the big cities is practically zero. People are yearning to be more self-reliant, more independent, more secure, and, yes, more free. In fact, for a host of people today, the longing for liberty trumps the desire for wealth and pleasure. What used to attract people to big cities now repulses them. And they are more than willing to downscale their incomes and living standards in order to live simpler and breath freer.<br />
In reality, secession is not a future event; it has already started. People all over America are separating from their homes and families, from their jobs and livelihoods, from their cities and states, and from their very way of life in order to find even a semblance of what America used to look like. This trend will not diminish anytime soon. In fact, I am convinced it has not yet begun to peak.</p>
<p>So, don’t despair my friends. The Spirit of ’76 is alive and well&#8211;and not just in America but in many regions around the world also. The smell of independence is in the air. It smells so sweet. Take a big whiff. Then prayerfully decide to what and to where that wind is leading you.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan’s analysis of the modern independence movement just might be more of a prophecy than anything else.</p>
<p>I cannot help but think of the speech John Adams gave to the Continental Congress as it contemplated the Declaration of Independence. When one thinks of fiery speeches for independence, one normally thinks of Patrick Henry, Sam Adams, or James Otis. But John Adams’ speech to the Continental Congress ranks up there with the greatest of them. So, for all of my freedom-loving brothers and sisters in America and around the world who are already, in their own way, engaged in the independence movement, I conclude this column with the concluding words from that immortal speech:</p>
<p>“Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see, I see clearly, through this day’s business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not live to the time when this Declaration shall be made good. We may die; die, colonists; die, slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on the scaffold. Be it so; be it so! If it be the pleasure of heaven that my country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But, while I do live, let me have a country, or at least, the hope of a country, and that a free country.</p>
<p>“But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured that this Declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood, but it will stand, and it will richly compensate for both. Through the thick gloom of the present, I see the brightness of the future, as the sun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires and illuminations. On its annual return, they will shed tears, copious, gushing tears, not of subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of gratitude and of joy.</p>
<p>“Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves this measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I hope, in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it. And I leave off as I began, that, live or die, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment, Independence now, and INDEPENDENCE FOREVER!”</p>
<p>Amen and Amen!</p>

				<p>October 10, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18896#respond" title="Comment on The UAW Takes One Step Forward And One Backward"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="18896 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18896">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/uawworkers3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/uawworkers2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Trying to rebound off the ropes, where it has been pummeled for the past several decades, The United Auto Workers (UAW) has launched an aggressive organizing campaign in the South, in line with an AFL-CIO resolution emphasizing organizing there, where unionization rates are weak across the board.</p>
<p>As reported in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F10%2F07%2Fbusiness%2Fat-a-nissan-plant-in-mississippi-a-battle-to-shape-the-uaws-future.html%3Fpagewanted%3Dall%26_r%3D0&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNH7cba5oXwjzcSVpGguAohp3J_aGA">The New York Times</a>, the UAW has taken an international approach where union members in Brazil are picketing Nissan dealerships, a U.S. UAW contingent is traveling to South Africa to embarrass Nissan over its antiunion policies, and a similar campaign is underway in Tokyo and Paris.</p>
<p>Actor Danny Glover, has been persuaded to visit college campuses to recruit students to help in the union drive, and community groups are being organized, which include the NAACP, to help as well.</p>
<p>All of these measures are positive steps. Because of globalization and the ease in which industries can escape to anti-worker environments, private sector unions have suffered serious setbacks since the early 1980s. But globalization can be countered.</p>
<p>For example and most importantly, because it is leaning on international support, the UAW has rightly felt obligated to return the favor. In 2010 the UAW demonstrated outside a Hyundai center near Detroit to support the striking workers in Korea. By helping the Korean workers win higher wages, the UAW reduces the incentive for auto industries to flee to Korea.</p>
<p>By repeating this strategy in all other countries with auto manufacturing, globalization in the auto sector could be forced to a standstill. Instead of workers from different countries competing against one another in a race to the bottom – where the goal is to accept lower wages in order to attract business – by adopting the principle of solidarity, workers around the world can begin to raise their standard of living and all rise together.</p>
<p>In this way we could begin to reverse the steady transfer of income from working people to corporations. As The New York Times reported (U.S. Companies Thrive As Workers Fall Behind, 2013): “…wages and salary income in 2012 amounted to 44 percent of G.D.P., the lowest at any time since 1929, which is as far back as the data goes…The flip side of that is that corporate profits after taxes amounted to a record 9.7 percent of G.D.P. Each of the last three years has been higher than the earlier record high, of 9.1 percent, which was set in 1929.”</p>
<p>The UAW’s effort to connect to students and community organizations has the potential to change the balance of forces. Corporations want good public relations. They invest in huge amounts of money to run one-page ads to tout how much money they contribute to local schools or how much they care for the environment. They know more than most of us that public opinion can be a powerful weapon because it serves as the foundation for culture, and a culture conducive to business interests is a huge money-saver for them.</p>
<p>By turning to the community in order to conduct a campaign of shame, the UAW can begin to change culture in a pro-worker direction, which, of course, would benefit most people. But this turn will have to embrace more than a cultural dimension in order to take hold; the union will have to actually champion causes that will benefit the community, for example, by demanding that corporations pay their fair share of taxes so that schools and social services can be properly funded. Those kinds of gains would amount to what are called, “game changers.”</p>
<p>But the UAW will have to overcome some of its missteps if it wants to succeed. In 2007 they accepted a contract that included a $14 per hour salary for new hires, thereby creating a yawning chasm between their pay and that of the current workforce. What this means is that the workers at that time voted in favor of reduced wages for other workers, not for themselves, which inevitably produces animosity between the two groups. But only solidarity can save the union at this point, so in the next contract the union must champion the wages of the newcomers over their more senior coworkers in order to reduce the wage-gap between them.</p>
<p>Secondly, UAW President Bob King has adopted a somewhat contradictory theoretical and strategic framework that needs adjusting. Labor Notes quotes him as saying: “We have completely discarded the ‘us versus them’ mentality.” But Labor Notes went on to note that Gary Walkowicz, who ran against King in the last election for president, doesn’t think that will work and quoted him as saying: “If we want to convince the people in the non-union plants, we have to fight,” he said. “Turn back the concessions and give people a reason to want to join the UAW.” Of course he is right.</p>
<p>In his interview with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.labornotes.org%2F2011%2F01%2Fuaw-says-it-will-go-%25E2%2580%2598all-in%25E2%2580%2599-organize-foreign-owned-auto-plants&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNFbTyAjc7ZGyqyquRdeMIb-3GWzcg">Labor Notes</a>, King offered this justification: “If workers have a larger voice they produce a better product,” In this way he hopes to promote employers’ success while rejecting “an adversarial work environment.”</p>
<p>There is usually a grain of truth in what people say, and King can boast of his grain, but he fails to capture the larger picture. His partnership philosophy is taking place within the context of capitalism, which radiates in all directions a culture of competition, self-interest and greed. In such a climate corporations are unable to distinguish between the highest good and the highest profit. Their number one concern is always their rate of profit. King’s philosophy will work only under limited conditions that have on the whole disappeared: if the company cannot move to a non-union location elsewhere and make a higher profit, then it will accept the partnership. But just as foxes are programmed to eat chickens, corporations are programmed to maximize profits, and genteel gestures will have little impact on this instinctive reaction. Unless globalization is brought to an abrupt halt, at least as it is currently practiced, King’s auto companies will move to greener pastures.</p>
<p>The “partnership” philosophy, which was trumpeted by John Sweeney, former head of the AFL-CIO, had disastrous consequences. Labor suffered some of its greatest defeats and watched its membership plummet.</p>
<p>Instead of turning to the corporations for partners, the UAW will need to redouble their efforts to build partnerships both domestically and internationally in order to organize a powerful movement of all those who are the victims of corporate policies. When the world’s population, that is overwhelmingly against corporate policies that impoverish workers and trash the environment, is organized, the balance of forces will shift and real change will be possible.</p>

<p>For the past several years, America finds itself fragmenting at the seams. We suffer a gridlocked Congress that watches problems grow and grow—but it fails to take action to solve anything. It continues endless wars abroad. It watches our educational systems disintegrate, but does nothing. Endless millions of minorities and the Middle Class cannot secure jobs, but Congress continues to import 100,000 green card holding immigrants every 30 days.</p>
<p>A mind-blowing 47 million Americans subsist on food stamps, but our U.S. Congress continues to offshore jobs, insource jobs and outsource jobs. Those 535 congressional critters do everything in their power to subvert the Middle Class of America.</p>
<p>Across America, illiteracy grows as 7,000 kids quit high school every day of the nine-month school cycle. CBS anchor Scott Pelley said, “Our educational results cannot sustain America.”</p>
<p>In other words, we cannot keep kicking illiterate kids into the job market and hope they can read, write and perform simple math—when they can’t.</p>
<p>We suffer Black-America revolting with marches over Latino-American Zimmerman killing African-American Martin with calls of racism, when, at the same time, 1,300 blacks killed 1,300 blacks from the Martin killing to the trial date. Black on black crime killed 1,299 black kids while blacks protested over one shooting of a Latino killing a black. It never occurs to them that black on black and black on white crime runs 1,000 to 1.</p>
<p>The Main Stream Media censors the phenomenon known as “Black Flash Mobs” where young blacks in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago and Minneapolis—run wild in streets beating up white people and looting stores.</p>
<p>Why? Those kids don’t enjoy fathers to mentor them toward responsible adulthood as 68 percent of all black kids in America are raised by single mothers. About 99 percent of them live on welfare and in poverty. (Source: Denver Post, Dottie Lamm) Yet, the Congress sits and knits, picks its nose and yawns and scratches its rear-end, but won’t get off its collective butt to solve the problems.</p>
<p>Our nation faces $16.5 trillion debt, entrenched poverty class, growing illiteracy, accelerating killings, intractable crime, drugs and unemployment.</p>
<p>Yet, it imports 100,000 legal Third World immigrants every 30 days. In 2013, we feature over 40 million people not born in this country. As they continue to bring in their families and birth their babies, whole communities in cities like Chicago, Miami, Houston and LA do not resemble America or speak our language.</p>
<p>Every American sees the mess exploding, but most remain clueless as to its origins.</p>
<p>On a recent radio show where I interview weekly, <a href="http://www.KGAB.com">www.KGAB.com</a> with Dave Chaffin on the “Morning Zone,” a caller asked a poignant question: “Will we ever get back to the America that I knew growing up as a kid?”</p>
<p>First of all, the America of 50 years ago with Norman Rockwell paintings of paper boys throwing papers onto the steps of nicely painted houses with picket fences—will not be seen again. Instead, we see violent mega-cities exploding beyond the sky line with air pollution and gridlock.</p>
<p>Since 1965, we imported 100 million third world immigrants because of Teddy Kennedy’s Immigration Reform Act. That bill continues today as it adds 1.2 million third world people annually.</p>
<p>We contorted America from three major ethnic tribal groups with the same Christian religion to over a dozen tribal groups with aggressive religions like Islam. If the current amnesty bill passes, it will import 1.5 million third world immigrants annually, or, about 125,000 new comers each month. Total: 100 million by 2050.</p>
<p>Where are they coming from? This two-minute video on Bangladesh will stun you, but this will be our end result: <a href="http://safeshare.tv/w/vwncRciSFb">http://safeshare.tv/w/vwncRciSFb</a></p>
<p>That video probably shocked the daylights out of you, but that’s what all of China, India, Bangladesh, Indochina and many other parts of the world face with their population loads. I’ve witnessed it first hand on my world bicycle travels. Worse, they come to America for a better life, but they continue propagating beyond reason.</p>
<p>Back to the question: Can we return America back to the way it was before this mass immigration juggernaut?</p>
<p>If we don’t reduce all immigration to less than 100,000 annually, instead of 100,000 monthly—we will never, ever return to what it meant to be an unhyphenated American. We will never enjoy religious civility as the Muslims grow their numbers and aggressively push for Sharia Law within America. We will never again enjoy a flourishing Middle Class. We will never again enjoy clean air and plenty of water.</p>
<p>We will not enjoy a single language or culture. We will never again enjoy unlimited freedom as we compact ourselves into cities and begin to resemble China, India and even Bangladesh before this century expires.</p>
<p>What to do? How to take action?</p>
<p>1.    Do everything in your power to stop S744 amnesty bill. Call, write, visit your Senators and House reps. Write letters to the editor, call your radio shows and push the issue to stop mass immigration.</p>
<p>2.    Join every organization you see on my website: <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.frostywooldridge.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGk9g72NySMHCol5y7ZYCn0QZwxbw" target="_blank">www.frostywooldridge.com</a> in order to make collective impact to stop passage of S744.</p>
<p>3.    Vote out any senator or congressman that thinks importing the entire third world or the projected 100 million new immigrants to this country within 37 years.</p>
<p>4.    Call or email Charlie Rose <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/h/y4hru0am4hc0/?&amp;v=b&amp;cs=wh&amp;to=CharlieRose@pbs.org" target="_blank">CharlieRose@pbs.org</a> and ask him to interview top environmental/population experts as to our future if we allow another 100 million people to be imported via mass immigration.  Write Matt Lauer, Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer, 60 Minutes, Dateline, Primetime, and ask them to interview top speakers as to our survival prospects of an America that grew from 316 million to 625 million people within this century.</p>
<p>5.    Join <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.CapsWeb.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPw1-Mx6pA-gQEodCh911QRV1m1A" target="_blank">www.CapsWeb.org</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.NumbersUSA.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHmOpkzGHGUo9cYsWTho7h47GlDMQ" target="_blank">www.NumbersUSA.org</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.FairUS.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2RIVn6zydYOR5Ga9AIzTxooKJ5w" target="_blank">www.FairUS.org</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alipacus.come&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHjTfztQVkbhuaGWGXujgrMeKdolw" target="_blank">www.alipacus.com</a> in order to join over 1.5 million Americans of all persuasions who collectively possess the power to stop mass immigration into America and work toward a viable and sustainable future for our civilization.  It’s free and powerful because you can send in pre-written faxes to your reps to enlighten them as to the consequences of a mass amnesty and jumping legal immigration to two million annually.  You will become part of an armada of parents, grandparents, citizens and more to change course toward a positive future.</p>
<p>6.    Send me your thoughts on more ideas I can share with Americans in order to regain or at least not lose any more of America than we have already.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/governmentshutdown3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/governmentshutdown3.jpg" align="left" /></a>Millions around the world today are hoping the US federal government shuts down at midnight on Monday. Many have thoughts of wars and occupations ending in their regions… but, sadly, this is not part of the “services” that will be cut during a shutdown.</p>
<p>In fact, not only will the Department of Offense continue on as usual but so will all the tyrannical agencies such as the DEA, IRS, ATF, CIA and countless other alphabet soup agencies of oppression.</p>
<p>What will “shut down”? According to CNN these are the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/23/politics/government-shutdown-daily-life/index.html?hpt=hp_t1" target="_blank">Top 10 Ways A Government Shutdown Would Affect Your Daily Life</a>:</p>
<p><strong>1. I’m Proud To Be An American.</strong> According to CNN, “the biggest hit would be to the collective psyche. America is the largest economy in the world and a beacon for how democracy ought to work”. It is sad if even one person in the US has their “psyche” hurt because of this! It is sad how many people in the US now consider their country/region and the government that rules it as being one in the same. Not to mention that the US was never designed to be a democracy… it was set-up as a Republic and all the founding fathers spoke very warily against any sort of democracy. Democracy, fundamentally, is mob rule and anti-freedom. It is the tyranny of the majority against the minority.</p>
<p><strong>2. Anything Dirty or Dingy or Dusty.</strong> It is unbelievable that this #2 reason from CNN warns people of how dramatically their lives will be affected if the federal government shuts down (and this after #1 was that it might hurt their “psyche”). It goes on to say that the only region in the entire country where trash pickup may stop in the event of a shutdown is in Washington, District of Criminals. Hardly a national disaster! And, not to mention, that if that really were the case, free market private enterprise would spring up, like in Detroit, and people would actually have good options for waste disposal rather than a communist style, centrally planned garbage pickup.</p>
<p><strong>3. Money.</strong> According to CNN, if you need a loan from the government, you won’t be able to get it in event of a shut down. Good! If you are such a credit risk that no one in private enterprise will lend you money then, definitely, the government shouldn’t lend you the money they stole from the innocent victims in their tax farm! They also mention that Socialist InSecurity (SS) cheques may stop coming. This is often one of the first things the government tries to scare people with, as Barack Obama did in 2011, during the last event of this type. Why? Because old people vote in much greater numbers than younger people and scaring them with threats of withheld money works. What should really scare them is that both the US government and its SS Ponzi scheme is bankrupt.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ammunition.</strong> According to CNN, “A shutdown would affect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Translation: That gun permit you wanted processed wouldn’t happen anytime soon”. The ATF shutting down would be a wonderful thing. So sad in the “land of the free” that one of the biggest threats to a government shutdown is that you may not get permission from the government to have a gun!</p>
<p><strong>5. Drugs.</strong> According to CNN, “The Republicans want to defund Obamacare in exchange for funding the government. But the health care act at the center of this storm would continue its implementation process during a shutdown. That’s because its funds aren’t dependent on the congressional budget process”. CNN is really reaching to find 10 ways this shut down will affect people when they explicitly state that #5 won’t affect drugs or Obamacare!</p>
<p><strong>6. The Mail.</strong> CNN is really running out of ideas now that they have to bring up the post office, that bankrupt, antiquated, 1800s style of delivering information that the internet, FedEx and UPS rendered it obsolete decades ago. Oh, but here CNN again let’s us know that even that embarrassing anachronism won’t actually shut down! “You know that whole ‘Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night’ thing? Apparently, the U.S. Postal Service works through shutdowns as well.”</p>
<p><strong>7. The Roads!</strong> Muh Roads! For the third time in a row CNN says this will be unaffected (what was the point of this list again?). They pitch this one as, “If you drive a car, I’ll tax the street” as though to lead you into thinking the roads will close without the federal government, but then they don’t mention roads again. Here’s what they had to say on it, “You may be thinking, ‘No functioning government, no need to pay taxes.’ Think again. The Man would continue to collect taxes. U.S. bonds would still be issued. And other essential banking functions would go on”. So, here is another one that won’t affect you, unfortunately. You still have to pay extortion to the federal government, even if they are “shut down”.</p>
<p><strong>8. The Military.</strong> CNN says, “The good news (for you) is that the men and women in uniform would continue to keep you safe. “… okay, that’s four in a row that won’t affect people on a list of 10 ways the shut down will affect you! Instead it is the usual propaganda trying to make people feel like the US military “protects” Americans.</p>
<p><strong>9. Celebrate!</strong> Seriously, this is #9 on the list. Here’s what they said, “Don’t come to work if you’re a federal employee. You’re on furlough. (Offer not valid for workers in ‘critical services,’ such as air traffic controllers, hazardous waste handlers and food inspectors.) Do take some time to celebrate. In previous shutdowns, everyone who stayed home was paid retroactively after peace returned to Washington”. So, the shutdown is a good thing because millions of federal government employees get a free vacation that will be paid by Americans who will be paying for them to do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>10. National Parks.</strong> According to CNN, “Need to get away? Well, you can’t. At least not to national parks. Or to national zoos. Or to national museums. They’d all be closed. That’s 368 National Park Service sites closed, millions of visitors turned away. Were you thinking more along the lines of a trip to France? If you don’t already have a passport, you might have to bid that adieu — you might not get your blue book in time. The last time the government threw a hissy fit, 200,000 applications for passports went unprocessed. Tourism and airline revenues reeled”. So, some parks may be shuttered and your permission to travel may be withheld.</p>
<p>That’s it? That’s the best that CNN can come up with on how a potential government shutdown will affect people? Your psyche may get hurt (if you had a delusional belief in the US government being the same as yourself); there may not be garbage collection in Washington, Den of Criminals; you won’t be able to get a federal loan and you may not get permission from the government to have a gun or travel.</p>
<p>And this is what has the mainstream media talking about non-stop?</p>
<p>Of course, if the Federal Reserve did not print the money (QE2Infinity) to keep the US government going with over a $1 trillion deficit per year, 90% plus of what the government does would come to an immediate halt. Then there would be countless very serious things that would “affect your life”. Anyone depending on food stamps (which is now over 50 million people), anyone depending on SS to survive would definitely be affected as there’d be no money to pay them. And, not to mention, every bank in the US would be insolvent and all depositor’s money would be lost as the FDIC is also bankrupt.</p>
<p>But, we aren’t betting on that ever happening. This is democracy, after all. And that means keeping the debts and new money flowing until the economic system collapses as the printing of money causes the eventual demise of the dollar and The End Of The Monetary System As We Know It (TEOTMSAWKI).</p>
<p>This system is now down to two options: massive debt default or massive inflation and neither is particularly good for anyone living in the US. Every major government or empire in history when faced with those two options chose to continue printing money until the currency collapsed.</p>
<p>In either case, what is happening today is nothing compared to what is going to happen. Use this time to prepare and get your assets, and if you can, even your own ass outside of what will be ground zero for this economic collapse, the US.</p>
<p>We talk about all the ways to do that at the <a href="http://dollarvigilante.com/subscribe">TDV newsletter</a> including things like putting your IRA into a <a href="http://tdvselfdirectedira.com/">self-directed IRA</a> and getting the assets internationalized (into precious metals offshore – like we talk about in <a href="http://goldoutofdodge.com/">Getting Your Gold Out Of Dodge</a> – and foreign real estate like <a href="http://galtsgulchchile.com/">Galt’s Gulch in Chile</a>), getting offshore bank accounts and set-up with an offshore corporation for your business endeavors (<a href="http://tdvoffshore.com/">TDV Offshore</a>), getting a foreign residency or passport (<a href="http://dollarvigilante.com/second-passports-and-residencies">TDV Passports</a>) and, if you have assets over $1 million, using <a href="http://tdvwealthmanagement.com/">TDV Wealth Management</a> to get the assets safely outside of the blast radius.</p>
<p>What is going on in Washington, DC, today could mean postponing a trip to Yellowstone national park or having delayed garbage pickup in DC itself. What is coming in the next few months and years has the potential to destroy all your assets and leave you devoid of any way of earning income as the economy is totally destroyed by a currency collapse.</p>
<p>The best case scenario for the populace of the US in the long run is for a complete shutdown of the US federal government… But, that collapse is going to be messy and a lot of people are going to get hurt in the short term during that collapse.</p>

<p><em>“The European race’s last three hundred years of evolutionary progress have all come down to nothing but four words: selfishness, slaughter, shamelessness and corruption.”<br />
Yan Fu</em></p>
<p>It only took the rest of the world 300 years to catch on to the evil that masquerades as “western civilization,” or perhaps it only took the rise of new powers with the confidence to state the obvious. Anyone doubtful of America’s responsibility for the evil needs to read <em>The Untold History of the United States</em> by Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick.</p>
<p>The “New American Century” proclaimed by the neoconservatives came to an abrupt end on September 6 at the G20 meeting in Russia. The leaders of most of the world’s peoples told Obama that they do not believe him and that it is a violation of international law if the US government attacks Syria without UN authorization.</p>
<p>Putin told the assembled world leaders that the chemical weapons attack was “a provocation on behalf of the armed insurgents in hope of the help from the outside, from the countries which supported them from day one.” In other words, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Washington–the axis of evil.</p>
<p>China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina joined Putin in affirming that a leader who commits military aggression without the approval of the UN Security Council puts himself “outside of law.”</p>
<p>In other words, if you defy the world, obama, you are a war criminal.</p>
<p>The entire world is waiting to see if the Israel Lobby can push obama into the role of war criminal. Many are betting that Israel will prevail over the weak american president, a cipher devoid of all principle. A couple of decades ago before the advent of the american sheeple, one of the last tough Americans, Admiral Tom Moorer, Chief of Naval Operations and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly declared that “no US president can stand up to Israel.” America’s highest ranking military officer could not get an honest investigation of the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty.</p>
<p>We are yet to see an american president who can stand up to Israel. Or, for that matter, a Congress that can. Or a media.</p>
<p>The obama regime tried to counter its smashing defeat at the G20 Summit by forcing its puppet states to sign a joint statement condemning Syria. However the puppet states qualified their position by stating that they opposed military action and awaited the UN report.</p>
<p>Most of obama’s bought-and-paid-for “supporters” are impotent, powerless. For example obama counts the UK as a supporting country because of the personal support of the discredited UK prime minister, david cameron, despite the fact that cameron was repudiated by the British Parliament in a vote that prohibits British participation in another of Washington’s war crimes. So, although cameron cannot bring the British people and the British government with him, obama counts the UK as a supporter of obama’s attack on Syria. Clearly, this is a desperate count of “supporting countries.”</p>
<p>The Turkish puppet government, which has been shooting its peacefully demonstrating citizens down in the streets, with no protest from obama or the Israel Lobby, supports “holding Syria accountable,” but not itself, of course, or Washington.</p>
<p>The puppet states of Canada and Australia, powerless countries, neither of which carry one ounce of world influence, have lined up to do the bidding of their Washington master. The entire point of having the top government job in Canada and Australia is the payoff from Washington.</p>
<p>The obama cipher also claims the support of Japan and the Republic of Korea, another two countries devoid of all diplomatic influence and power of any kind. Helpless Japan is on the verge of being destroyed by the Fukushima nuclear disaster, for which it has no solution. As the radiation leaks spread into the aquifer upon which Tokyo and surrounding areas rely, Japan is faced with the possibility of having to relocate 40 million people.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, implicated in the transfer to al-Nusra rebels of the chemical weapons used in the attack, supports Washington, knowing that otherwise its tyranny is toast. Even the neoconservatives headed by obama’s shrill National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, want to overthrow the Saudis.</p>
<p>Obama claims also to have support from France and Germany. However both Hollande and Merkel have stated clearly that a diplomatic solution, not war, is their first choice and that the outcome rests on the UN.</p>
<p>As for Italy and Spain’s support, both governments are hoping to be rewarded with the Federal Reserve printing enough dollars to bail out their indebted economies so that both governments are not overthrown in the streets for their acquiescence to the looting of their countries by international banksters. Like so many Western governments, those of Italy and Spain, and, of course, Greece, support the international banksters, not their own citizens.</p>
<p>The president of the European Commission has declared that the European Union, the central overlord over Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, does not support a military solution to the Syrian Crisis. “The European Union is certain that the efforts should be aimed at a political settlement,” Jose Manuel Barroso told reporters at the G20 meeting. The EU has the power to issue arrest warrants for the heads of EU governments that participate in war crimes.</p>
<p>What this reveals is that the support behind the liar obama is feeble and limited. The ability of the Western countries to dominate international politics came to an end at the G20 meeting. The moral authority of the West is completely gone, shattered and eroded by countless lies and shameless acts of aggression based on nothing but lies and self-interests. Nothing remains of the West’s “moral authority,” which was never anything but a cover for self-interest, murder, and genocide.</p>
<p>The West has been destroyed by its own governments, who have told too many self-serving lies, and by its capitalist corporations, who offshored the West’s jobs and technology to China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil, depriving the Western governments of a tax base and the support of its citizens.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know whether citizens in the West hate their corrupt governments any less than do Muslims, whose lives and countries have been devastated by Western aggression, or than do citizens of third world countries who have been impoverished by being looted by predatory First World financial organizations.</p>
<p>The idiot Western governments have pissed away their clout. There is no prospect whatsoever of the neoconservative fantasy of US hegemony being exercised over Russia, China, India, Brazil, South Africa, South America, Iran. These countries can establish their own system of international payments and finance and leave the dollar standard whenever they wish. One wonders why they wait. The US dollar is being printed in unbelievable quantities and is no longer qualified to be the world reserve currency. The US dollar is on the verge of total worthlessness.</p>
<p>The G20 Summit made it clear that the world is no longer willing to go along with the West’s lies and murderous ways. The world has caught on to the West. Every country now understands that the bailouts offered by the West are merely mechanisms for looting the bailed-out countries and impoverishing the people.</p>
<p>In the 21st century Washington has treated its own citizens the way it treats citizens of third world countries. Untold trillions of dollars have been lavished on a handful of banks, while the banks threw millions of Americans out of their homes and seized any remaining assets of the broken families.</p>
<p>US corporations had their taxes cut to practically nothing, with few paying any taxes at all, while the corporations gave the jobs and careers of millions of Americans to the Chinese and Indians. With those jobs went US GDP, tax base, and economic power, leaving Americans with massive budget deficits, a debased currency, and bankrupt cities, such as Detroit, which once was the manufacturing powerhouse of the world.</p>
<p>How long before Washington shoots down its own homeless, hungry, and protesting citizens in the streets?</p>
<p>Washington represents Israel and a handful of powerful organized private interests. Washington represents no one else. Washington is a plague upon the American people and a plague upon the world.</p>

			<p><em>This bankster run system does not work for you and I. After reading this article and you still have not taken your money out of their banks and you have not stopped shopping in globalist stores like Walmart and you are not planning to trade and barter with your neighbors as well as grow your own food, then you get the dismal future you deserve. If you stay in the banksters system and continue to participate in this rigged game stemming from Wall Street, you are sowing the seeds of your own destruction!</em></p>
<h4>There Is a New Elephant in the Room</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/escape-wall-street.jpg" width="300" height="200" />There are a series of new free trade agreements which threaten to obliterate the cities of the United States in the same manner we have witnessed in Detroit. Among the worst of these new free trade agreements is the one entitled “<a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/08/14/escape-from-wall-street/entitled%20%22Increasing%20American%20Jobs%20Through%20Greater%20Exports%20to%20Africa%20Act%20of%202013%20(H.R.%201777).%22" target="_blank">Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013</a> (H.R. 1777).”</p>
<p>The premise of this article is based upon the fact that Detroit was primarily destroyed by the anti-worker free trade agreements of NAFTA and CAFTA.</p>
<p>If the complete destruction of one American city was not enough, through NAFTA and CAFTA, we should all be concerned that Congress is preparing to pass H.R. 1777. H.R. 1777 is not just another free trade agreement, but this is far worse than NAFTA and CAFTA in that this bill takes American taxpayer money and funds industrial infrastructure in many of the 54 African countries in order to make them “factory ready.” America, you are soon going to be forced to fund your own economic demise. Not only will you likely lose your job, witness your city going broke, but you will go deeper into debt paying the taxes that Congress will require to fund the African Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Before discussing the impact of <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1777/text" target="_blank">H.R. 1777</a> on America as a whole, we can get a strong sense of what it is going to be like when this bill passes by quickly examining the impact of NAFTA and CAFTA on Detroit.</p>
<h4>NAFTA, CAFTA and the Destruction of the Motor City</h4>
<p>At the height of Detroit’s success as a city. the city was a representation of the American middle class dominance. It was greatest manufacturing city ever seen on the planet. Detroit once made cars that were the envy of the world.</p>
<p>At its peak, Detroit was the America’s fourth-largest city, with more than 1.8 million people. Detroit’s population losses began in the 1960s with migration to the suburbs. Then in the 1990′s Detroit fell victim to global politics in the names of NAFTA and CAFTA and literally, the roof caved in.<b></b></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/detroit-2.jpg" width="276" height="183" />Today, 30% of Detroit’s 140 square miles are either <a href="http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/87054002.html" target="_blank">vacant or deserted</a>. Detroit used to be the fourth-largest city in the US, with a population of nearly 2 million people. Today, Detroit has less than 700,000 residents. There are more than 33,500 <a href="http://spectregroup.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/downtown-rural-detroit/" target="_blank">vacant houses</a>and over 90,000 vacant lots in Detroit. The city government is <a href="http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/87054002.html" target="_blank">razing</a> entire city blocks of business buildings and residential homes. If you are the only one left on your block, you are forced to move and if you are lucky you will receive $10,000 for your home.</p>
<p>Under NAFTA and CAFTA, virtually all tariffs were eliminated so that manufacturers could shut down U.S. plants and relocate to the third world in order that they could pay their new, foreign workers slave labor wages. Then, adding insult to injury, when NAFTA and CAFTA eliminated tariffs, they made it possible for the multinational corporations to ship these foreign made products back into the U.S. and pay no import taxes at all. Thus, the great city of Detroit was destroyed.</p>
<h4>The National Impact of the African Free Trade Agreement</h4>
<p>Soon after H.R. 1777 passes, every major city is going to look like Detroit. As bad as NAFTA and CAFTA are, at least the government did not take trillions of America dollars to build infrastructure in foreign labor markets. Yet, this is exactly what the African Free Trade Agreement is going to do.</p>
<p>I have to hand it to Congress for their undisguised boldness as they are not even hiding this private theft of public money. Additionally, Congress has the nerve to title this bill in such a way that it appears that American jobs are going to be created by passage of the bill. Sadly, most of the sheep will believe them.</p>
<p>How can I be sure that H.R. 1777 will be passed?</p>
<h4>A Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing</h4>
<p>In addition to H.R. 1777, SB 718 “Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013,” is being run through the Senate. The language for both bills is identical.</p>
<p>Additionally, the text of H.R. 1777 turns up in SB 431, the Nepal Trade Preferences Act, and SB 432, the Asia-South Pacific Trade Preferences Act. The language for all four bills is virtually identical.</p>
<p>Why do the banksters need all four bills with the same language? Simple, if one bill does not pass, the other three bills still have a chance.</p>
<p>For those who do not think that Congress doesn’t cater to the whims of Wall Street, explain why these bills contain provisions for global health, global education, global transportation and global water?</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it, there is an excellent chance that at least one of these bills will pass.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This bill is being perpetrated by the international banksters on Wall Street. Why do we continue to fund this criminal government, who in turns funds Wall Street? The solution resides in defunding the government which hands our money and our jobs over to the thugs on Wall Street. It makes no sense to continue funding our demise.</p>
<p>There are several options. First, there are countries which would be happy to accept skilled Americans because of the boost to their economy. Can you imagine if 100 million Americans suddenly left the country? Certainly, the government would eventually move to impose an iron curtain type of restriction on leaving the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should withdraw from the Wall Street system as much as possible. I can see the day where people cash out of their 401K’s (the government is preparing to steal them anyway), withdraw money from your bank account and invest with other like-minded people in a farm collective. Trading and bartering would be the new underground economy. By owning farms, urban refugees would be food sufficient, could become water sufficient with the proper planning and we could largely be out of the reach of the feds. However, there is one caveat. In a brilliant move, the Obama administration and the Supreme Court mandated participation in the Obamacare system. In my opinion, this was establishment’s way to keep people in their system. Obviously, defying the dictates of Obamacare would have to become our first line of civil disobedience.</p>
<p>There is a third option. The American people could defy the tyrannical laws to the point where the country erupts into a civil war. I prefer the second option because it comes the closest to nonviolent revolution. However, my instincts and knowledge of history tells me we are in for a very serious civil war. The flash point for what is coming will be gun confiscation.</p>
<p>Of course, the fourth option is to acquiesce. Presently, that is what well over half the country is presently doing. It is sad to think that so many will go quietly into the night without putting up a fight.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, all Americans have a choice on whether we are going to stop funding our destruction.</p>

			<p><strong>The US empire&#8217;s illusion of benign omnipotence has been broken by the heroic acts of Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden writes Neil Harrison&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="In god we trust" src="http://www.counterfire.org/images/stories/feb2013/in_god_we_trust_lg.jpg" width="520"/></p>
</div>
<p>The grotesque climax to the manifest destiny dream. Invisible in the sky, malevolent and capricious, an Old Testament-style god rains arbitrary, brutal fate upon unsuspecting civilians.</p>
<p>On that Baghdad street, on that day, god existed. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/06/us-iraq-usa-journalists-idUSTRE6344FW20100406">Reuters journalist</a> and his driver, gunned down for carrying an extended camera lens; the father killed taking his children to school; his children – injured and forced to witness their father&#8217;s abject death. For all of these people and more, god existed that day and his name was America.</p>
<div><img title="Bradley Manning" alt="Bradley Manning" src="http://www.counterfire.org/images/stories/feb2013/bradley_manning_lg.jpg" width="260" height="244" align="right" /><br />
<strong>Bradley Manning</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Of course, this was <a href="http://cpj.org/2010/04/wikileaks-video-iraq-attack-killed-reuters-staffers.php">the footage</a> which finally convinced the troubled Private Bradley Manning to begin a campaign of, in his own words, &#8220;shattering the fantasy.&#8221; Thanks to Manning, no serious observer of this video, or of USA foreign policy in general, could now continue to indulge in the fantasy of America as the world&#8217;s friendly policeman, not without excercising some serious double-think. Especially not while listening to the Apache helicopter&#8217;s crew gloat and laugh as they kill and maim innocents (it somehow gets worse the more you see it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arguably, the video was the most important thing that Bradley Manning leaked before his arrest and incarceration. Footage of other Apache helicopter attacks in Iraq were already available on Youtube, transcripts from the attack had already been printed elsewhere in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/11/books/review/Stanton-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">a book</a> and the world already knew that the Reuters journalists had been killed by American forces, but images and sounds have a visceral impact which mere words often lack. A worldwide, large-scale audience was, for this particular video, guaranteed by the involvement of Wikileaks &#8211; Julian Assange&#8217;s flair for understated drama publicly piled up embarassment for the US military. Headline status meant that millions could now no longer continue with the &#8216;fantasy&#8217; anymore than they could &#8216;unsee&#8217; the footage. Therefore, by the time Manning&#8217;s subsequent leaks (including the <a href="http://wikileaks.org/irq/">war logs</a> and the notorious <a href="http://wikileaks.org/cablegate.html">diplomatic cables</a>) came to light, they were being registered by a global public already primed with enlightened eyes and a deep sense of scepticism.</p>
<p>The convergence of a multitude of factors provided Manning with motive and opportunity to inflict one of the biggest clusterfucks in the American god-machine&#8217;s history of propaganda war- US government paranoia post 9/11 meant that, due to their insistence on inter-department &#8216;sharing,&#8217; anyone with clearance could access virtually all government information. Manning&#8217;s genius with computers allowed him to trawl for his quarry with ease. Moreover, he felt desperately isolated. In the Mesopotamian desert, thousands of miles from home, among unsympathetic colleagues – it was far from the perfect situation for a very young man suffering deep personal turmoil. Most importantly of all, however, and the thing we should remember above all else, is that Private Bradley Manning <em>cared</em>.</p>
<p>He cared that he may have been complicit in a regime which employed (or contracted out) torture, &#8220;<em>I was actively involved in something that I was completely against&#8230;</em>&#8221; He cared that his fellow Americans were deliberately being kept ignorant of the true nature of their government&#8217;s foreign policy, &#8220;<em>I want people to see the truth…without information, you cannot make informed decisions as a public.</em>&#8221; Manning cared enough to risk pissing off a god.</p>

<img title="Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower. Photograph: Guardian" alt="Edward Snowden" src="http://www.counterfire.org/images/stories/feb2013/edward_snowden.jpg" align="left" width="320"/><br />
<strong>Edward Snowden</strong></p>
</div>
<p>As this week&#8217;s verdict of <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/bradley-manning-found-guilty-on-20-counts-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-20130730">guilty on twenty counts</a> (though, symbolically, not &#8216;aiding the enemy,&#8217; which begs the question – <em>if no &#8216;enemy&#8217; was &#8216;aided&#8217; where the hell is the crime?</em>) could potentially result in over 130 years jail time for him, and bearing in mind the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/05/extreme-solitary-confinement-what-did-bradley-manning-experience.html">dreadful incarceration</a> he has already endured, this god is at pains to ensure few follow suit.</p>
<p>The American god-machine sent its son to the Middle-east. Once there, he made a stand for truth and human compassion. For his sacrifice he is now being symbolically martyred. Does this sound familiar? You would be forgiven for finding these comparisons somewhat contrived (put it down to artistic licence). However, before dismissing the notion entirely, consider a couple of further examples.</p>
<p>Firstly, thanks to the actions of another brave whistleblower, Edward Snowden, we now know something of American pretensions to omnipotence. America&#8217;s National Security Agency, it is becoming ever more apparent, are now able to read private emails and listen in on telephone conversations not only in the US. but <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/07/nsa-costly-european-adventure.html">across the globe</a>. For reasons of security, in order to protect you, the NSA needs to be able to hear your weekly takeaway order. America-god knows your favourite pizza toppings. Feel safer?</p>
<p>Finally, there exists the reality of ritual appeasement. In Slavoj Zizek&#8217;s <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/1161-the-year-of-dreaming-dangerously"><em>The Year of Dreaming Dangerously</em></a><em>, </em>he describes<em> </em>how the US must:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;&#8230;suck up a daily influx of one billion dollars from other nations to pay for its consumption and is, as such, the universal Keynesian consumer that keeps the world economy running. (So much for the anti-Keynesian economic ideology that seems to predominate today!) This influx, which is effectively like the tithe paid to Rome in antiquity (or the gifts sacrificed to the Minotaur by the Ancient Greeks), relies on a complex economic mechanism: the US is &#8220;trusted&#8221; as the safe and stable center, so that all the others, from the oil-producing Arab countries to Western Europe and Japan, and now even the Chinese, invest their surplus profits in the US. Since this trust is primarily ideological and military, not economic, the problem for the US is how to justify its imperial role – it needs a permanent state of war, thus the &#8220;war on terror,&#8221; offering itself as the universal protector of all other &#8220;normal&#8221; (not &#8220;rogue&#8221;) states.&#8217;[1]</p></blockquote>
<p>Herein lies the truth of the matter. America is not a god, it simply wears this diguise of &#8216;justification,&#8217; therefore maintaining the inflated faux-capacity, to attempt to behave like one. In truth, the US is becoming increasingly desperate to appease and control its own economic god.</p>
<p>But who benefits from this global arrangement? The American people? Maybe we should ask the <a href="http://www.freep.com/usatoday/article/2594203">citizens of Detroit</a> that one?</p>
<p>If we in the &#8216;liberal&#8217; West really are benefitting from this international tithe-paying/war-making economic regime, then at least now, thanks to Manning and Snowden, we can appreciate the true cost it incurs. Perhaps we may yet glimpse our own future therein, because the only people who have ever genuinely benefitted, who will <em>ever</em> benefit, from the system Zizek describes, are in a tiny and exclusive minority. In the words of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154380.Mind_Breaths">Allen Ginsberg</a>, they are:</p>
<p align="center"><em>The Secret,</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>The Drunk,</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>The Brutal,</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>The Dirty Rich.</em></p>
<p>Describing the way in which &#8220;<em>emancipatory politics</em>,&#8221; such as socialism or feminism, work &#8220;<em>by reaching for a future</em>,&#8221; Terry Eagleton invokes [2] a useful image:</p>
<p>&#8220;[They insert]<em> the thin end of the wedge of the future into the heart of the present. They represent a bridge between present and future , a point where the two intersect.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This is exactly what Manning and Snowden have achieved. They have given us a brief view of a future in which no state can be unaccountable for its actions, however clandestine, however obscure its motives &#8211; not even the most powerful on Earth.</p>
<p>Our immediate task for the future is to continue forcing the &#8216;wedge,&#8217; to ensure that the illusion continues to be shattered. Let no motive of those who would make war go uninterogated. Let no action of those who hoard wealth at the expense of the pain, suffering and even the lives of others go unchallenged. This is how best to honour the bravery and sacrifices of Manning, Snowden and others like them. This is how we will display our solidarity with them as they face uncertain futures. This is how we will consign the gods to history.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/randgoldman3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/randgoldman2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>At first thought, the different philosophical positions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a> seem to be well defined. Notwithstanding, the contrast between a propensity towards anarchism with an advocacy for laissez-faire capitalism, both Russian born &#8220;<a href="http://khazars.wordpress.com/">Khazar</a> Jewish&#8221; theorists and activists shared a rejection of a theist metaphysics. When <a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/goldframe.htm">Emma Goldman</a> states: (speaking from a Detroit pulpit in 1898, quoted from Annie Laurie Gaylor, Women Without Superstition, p. 382), <em>&#8220;I do not believe in God, because I believe in man. Whatever his mistakes, man has for thousands of years past been working to undo the botched job your God has made&#8221;</em>, her mindset distinctly sets her apart from the main body of Western Civilization thought.</p>
<p>Published back in February 1916 in the Mother Earth journal, <a href="http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/goldman/philosophyatheism.html">The Philosophy of Atheism</a> by Emma Goldman; her core cosmology cannot be clearer.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Only after the triumph of the Atheistic philosophy in the minds and hearts of man will freedom and beauty be realized. Beauty as a gift from heaven has proved useless. It will, however, become the essence and impetus of life when man learns to see in the earth the only heaven fit for man. Atheism is already helping to free man from his dependence upon punishment and reward as the heavenly bargain- counter for the poor in spirit.</p>
<p>Do not all theists insist that there can be no morality, no justice, honesty or fidelity without the belief in a Divine Power? Based upon fear and hope, such morality has always been a vile product, imbued partiy with self-righteousness, partly with hypocrisy. As to truth, justice, and fidelity, who have been their brave exponents and daring proclaimers? Nearly always the godless ones: the Atheists; they lived, fought, and died for them. They knew that justice, truth, and fidelity are not, conditioned in heaven, but that they are related to and interwoven with the tremendous changes going on in the social and material life of the human race; not fixed and eternal, but fluctuating, even as life itself. To what heights the philosophy of Atheism may yet attain, no one can prophesy. But this much can already be predicted: only by its regenerating fire will human relations be purged from the horrors of the past.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a famous Playboy magazine interview, Ayn Rand, while rejecting a faith-based religion, is more deferential toward the chronicle of basing a moral society on ethical standards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Playboy: Has no religion, in your estimation, ever offered anything of constructive value to human life?</p>
<p><a href="http://atheism.about.com/library/quotes/bl_q_ARand.htm">Ayn Rand</a>: Qua religion, no &#8211; in the sense of blind belief, belief unsupported by, or contrary to, the facts of reality and the conclusions of reason. Faith, as such, is extremely detrimental to human life: it is the negation of reason. But you must remember that religion is an early form of philosophy, that the first attempts to explain the universe, to give a coherent frame of reference to man&#8217;s life and a code of moral values, were made by religion, before men graduated or developed enough to have philosophy. And, as philosophies, some religions have very valuable moral points. They may have a good influence or proper principles to inculcate, but in a very contradictory context and, on a very &#8211; how should I say it? &#8211; dangerous or malevolent base: on the ground of faith.</p></blockquote>
<p>A concise and insightful comparison is cited from the abstract, <a href="http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI3154612/">Models of individuality in Emma Goldman&#8217;s and Ayn Rand&#8217;s theories of civil society</a>, by Janet Elizabeth Day of Purdue University.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This research examines different conceptions of the individual of two theorists representing different strains of libertarian thought: Emma Goldman, and Ayn Rand. The unifying and central concern for both women is the prioritization of the individual. Owing to some extent to their shared cultural heritage and intellectual influence as Russian Jewish émigrés, similarities can be identified between Goldman&#8217;s and Rand&#8217;s definition of the individual and belief that society should be organized so as to afford the individual the greatest possible freedom and autonomy; however, real and substantive distinctions exist as well. Goldman advocates a society based on free communism in which people organize according to the free association of federations. Rand advocates a society based on laissez-faire capitalism in which a limited constitutional government enforces contracts between individuals. What unites their theories is their reliance on ethical egoism as a means to producing self-directed individuals who are best prepared to live in a free society as productive members.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What better example of the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism">ethical egoism</a> is there, than the popular attitude associated with <a href="http://www.resetdoc.org/story/00000021412">Secularism, Post-Secularism, Religion and the ‘Open Society’</a>. In this paper by Reinhard Schulze, he quotes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(philosopher">Charles Taylor</a> accordingly.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I want to argue that we are moving toward a sort of &#8220;fragmentation&#8221; of the spiritual, in which its previous connection with whole societies, be this in the older medieval form of sacred monarchies or in the modern form of &#8220;civil religion&#8221;, is being strained to breaking point. We are entering a ‘post-Durkheimian’ age [a situation in which faith is not connected, or only weakly connected, to a national political identity]. We end up living in what I want to call an ‘immanent frame.’&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Both Goldman and Rand would seem to be more comfortable with a humankind centric society that dismisses trust in the promise of an afterlife and shape standards for ethical conduct, grounded upon the wisdom of the ages. If Taylor is correct that the <em>national political identity</em> is now based upon some kind of an elusive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immanent_Frame">immanent frame</a>, just what is the role of the prevailing secular humanism ethos system?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?page=what&amp;section=main">The Council for Secular Humanism</a> offers the following outline to the question, What Is Secular Humanism?</p>
<p>Secular Humanism is a term, which has come into use in the last thirty years to describe a world-view with the following elements and principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>• A conviction that dogmas, ideologies and traditions, whether religious, political or social, must be weighed and tested by each individual and not simply accepted on faith.</p>
<p>• to the use of critical reason, factual evidence, and scientific methods of inquiry, rather than faith and mysticism, in seeking solutions to human problems and answers to important human questions.</p>
<p>• A primary concern with fulfillment, growth, and creativity for both the individual and humankind in general.</p>
<p>• A constant search for objective truth, with the understanding that new knowledge and experience constantly alter our imperfect perception of it.</p>
<p>• A concern for this life and a commitment to making it meaningful through better understanding of ourselves, our history, our intellectual and artistic achievements, and the outlooks of those who differ from us.</p>
<p>• A search for viable individual, social and political principles of ethical conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility.</p>
<p>• A conviction that with reason, an open marketplace of ideas, good will, and tolerance, progress can be made in building a better world for ourselves and our children.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Secular Humanists often argue that religion is not necessary for people to be altruistic, while Objectivists reject altruism outright and most Marxist Collectivists share Goldman’s stance, base upon a system on atheistic gratification and <a href="http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/goldman/sp001501.html">The Failure of Christianity</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How much more ennobling, how much more beneficial is the extreme individualism of Stirner and Nietzsche than the sick-room atmosphere of the Christian faith. If they repudiate altruism as an evil, it is because of the example contained in Christianity, which set a premium on parasitism and inertia, gave birth to all manner of social disorders that are to be cured with the preachment of love and sympathy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Religionists often criticize secular humanism for not offering any eternal truths, while Objectivists tend to regard the laws by which the free market operates to be eternal truths. <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/goldman/works/1940/individual.htm">Goldman</a> purports that, &#8220;All progress has been essentially an unmasking of &#8220;divinity&#8221; and &#8220;mystery,&#8221; of alleged sacred, eternal &#8220;truth&#8221;; it has been a gradual elimination of the abstract and the substitution in its place of the real, the concrete.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most striking difference is that Secular Humanism insists that personal liberty must be combined with social responsibility, whereas Objectivism actively rejects social responsibility in favor of individual self-interest, while Goldman the Anarchist states: &#8220;People have only as much liberty as they have the intelligence to want and the courage to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether Charles Taylor’s <em>immanent frame</em> is real or not, the fact is that the secular doctrine that fills the couches of mindless electronic self-delusion, keep the aisles empty in the humanism churches that lost sight of the essence of eternal truths. Both Goldman and Rand reject the validity of mystic revelation and the immorality of the spiritual soul.</p>
<p>If the history of civilized society founded upon institutional religion, is replete with suffering and carnage; by what strange twist of belief in the ethical egoism of Goldman’s nihilist collectivism and Rand’s objectivism, could possibly make life better?</p>
<p>Individuals like Goldman and Rand are lost. They are solitary purdah pretentious intellectuals without the presence of God in their life. The screen curtain they erect around their egotism is a veritable veil surrounding their own lack of humanity.</p>

			<p><em>Cities don’t die because of happenstance. The city of Detroit has been murdered by the same forces that are slowly killing cities all across the United States.</em></p>
<h4>Detroit Becomes the Largest US City to Declare Bankruptcy</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detroit-chapter-9.jpg" width="259" height="194" />On July 18, 2013, Detroit declared <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-0719-detroit-bankruptcy-20130719,0,7289375.story">Chapter 9 bankruptcy</a> to squelch most of their $18 billion in debts. The Chapter 9 filing occurred only four months after the appointment of an emergency financial manager. <em>“Let me be blunt: Detroit’s broke,”</em> says Michigan’s governor, Rick Snyder. Snyder went on to say that Detroit is the heart of Michigan and if Detroit is in trouble, Michigan is in trouble.</p>
<p>Detroit is the largest American city to declare bankruptcy, officially succumbing to job losses in the auto industry, decades of population flight, and the collapse of revenue to cover everything from policing to street lighting.</p>
<p>By the end of this article, the reader will come to see the prophetic wisdom of Governor Snyder’s words as the bankruptcy of Detroit is a portend of what is to come to most American cities.</p>
<h4>Detroit Was Once the Pride of America</h4>
<p>At the height of Detroit’s success as a city. the city was a representation of the American middle class dominance. It was greatest manufacturing city ever seen on the planet. Detroit made cars that were the envy of the world.</p>
<p><strong>At its peak, Detroit was the America’s fourth-largest city, with more than 1.8 million people. Detroit’s population losses began in the 1960s with migration to the suburbs. Then in the 1990′s Detroit fell victim to global politics and literally, the roof caved in.</strong></p>
<h4>How It All Went Wrong</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detroit-2.jpg" width="276" height="183" />Today, almost 30% of Detroit’s 140 square miles are either <a href="http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/87054002.html">vacant or deserted</a>. Detroit used to be the fourth-largest city in the US, with a population of nearly 2 million people. Today, Detroit has less than 700,000 residents. There are more than 33,500 <a href="http://spectregroup.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/downtown-rural-detroit/">vacant houses</a> and over 90,000 vacant lots in Detroit. The city government is <a href="http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/87054002.html">razing</a> entire city blocks of business buildings and residential homes. If you are the only one left on your block, you are forced to move and if you are lucky you will receive $10,000 for your home.</p>
<p>The median price of a home in Detroit is only <a href="http://stumpyscorner.blogspot.com/2013/02/detroit-preview-of-america.html">$9,000</a>! In some areas in Detroit, you can buy a house for just <a href="http://stumpyscorner.blogspot.com/2013/02/detroit-preview-of-america.html">$100</a>. There are approximately 85,000 streetlights in Detroit, but copper thieves have stripped so much wiring out  that many of the lights are not working. The Mayor of Detroit previously announced that he will <a href="http://www.1st-interiordesign.com/what/what-the-hell-is-happening-in-detroit-everything-you-need-to-know.html">reduce the number of streetlights</a>to almost half the existing total down to 46,000.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, sixty percent of Detroit’s children live in poverty, when less than 45 years ago, Detroit boasted the highest per capita income in the United States. Today, Detroit does not have one chain supermarket left in the city.</p></blockquote>
<p>It has one of the highest murder rates in its country. Its infrastructure has been gutted. Real unemployment may be as high 20% in some parts of the city. This is a real bad city to not be able to find a cop and with the new cutbacks, it is really hard to find a cop because most police stations in Detroit now only <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/13/detroit-police-precinct-business-hours_n_1204069.html">open to the public</a> for 8 hours per day. So, if you have to defend yourself, you better be prepared to get through the night on your own. You can call the police on your Obama phone, however, you better only call between 8am and 5pm. Just how dangerous is it? Justifiable homicide in Detroit rose by an amazing 79% during 2011.</p>
<h4>The Globalists Murdered Detroit City</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detroit-and-the-banks.jpg" width="300" height="168" />The globalists murdered Detroit through the various free trade agreements. Through NAFTA, GATT, and CAFTA, American auto manufacturing were free to ship their factories overseas in search of near slave labor markets. The passage of these free trade agreements made it possible to hire foreign slave laborers and without the now prohibited tariffs on imports, the globalist controlled corporations could ship slave labor manufactured products back into the United States. Our government failed to protect manufacturers and the net effect is that we are beginning to see third world conditions inside of the United States in cities such as Detroit and it is spreading like wildfire. Since the 1970′s, America has lost <a href="http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/10680.pdf">86%</a> of its manufacturing jobs. Actually, the Globalists have been trying to get rid of American tariffs for 100 years in the name of free trade. Look up the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, it is part of our history. A year later, we got the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and then real fun began in earnest.</p>
<p>Tariffs used to pay our national debt. This is no longer, we replaced tariffs with the Income Tax Amendment. If you are reading this historical facts for the first time, you have to be getting angry. And who could blame you for getting angry? You and I should not be paying income tax, tariffs should be paying for the national debt. We are paying income tax because the globalists wanted free trade and it is our “duty to pay” so they can maximize their profits. The third leg of this scheme was to introduce fiat currency where bankers could invent money out of thin air which caused our money to now be worth less than 4 cents for what used to be a dollar.</p>
<p>Now, back to Detroit which helps us understand where we are headed. You may not live in an area of the country in which the jobs are headed overseas. However, you have been targeted for de-industrialization through Obama’s Cap and Trade policies which he has declared he will initiate through Executive Order as this president continues to carry out his Agenda 21 goals.</p>
<p>If you ever let Agenda 21 get a grip on your city, the result will be like Detroit and will result in abject poverty as a result of green zones, Wildlands, promises of Smart Growth, saving the planet from global warming and economic growth inhibitors, etc. By the way, the globalists have the guts to build a $25 million dollar light rail in Detroit, right in the middle of this rotting corpse.</p>
<h4>What Happens When a City Goes Into Default?</h4>
<p>Look for an organization such at the World Bank to loan Detroit the $18 billion dollars it needs in order to regain temporary financial solvency. However, without a viable industry to maintain the economic foundation of the city, the city will predictably default on its future loan obligations. What follows is a glimpse into the future of all American cities as an increasing number of cities default on their “rescue” loans.</p>
<p>When a political entity defaults on its loans, the lending agency takes possession of the collateral which was pledged to cover the loan. Most often, the infrastructure is the collateral most sought after by the banks. When banksters typically take control over a political entity, like they did in Bolivia, they will quadruple the cost of water, astronomically hike the price of utilities and seize control of public transportation in order to jack up the rates to its ridership (i.e. poor people who cannot afford a car and need public transportation to get to work.). This is Detroit’s future and it will soon be all of our futures.</p>
<div><img alt="Municipal bankruptcy, America’s decent into corporate controlled feudalism." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detroit-bankruptcy-all-over-the-country1.jpg" width="590" height="406" /><em>Municipal bankruptcy, America’s decent into corporate controlled feudalism</em></p>
</div>
<p>Detroit has failed as a viable entity because of the loss of manufacturing and subsequent population flight out of the city. The rest of our cities will all experience an economic collapse but for different reasons.</p>
<p>When, not if, Obama ushers in his industry killing Cap and Trade Executive orders, every American city will effectively be deindustrialized and we will have nation full of Detroits.</p>
<p>Do you know that Obama has stated that his Cap and Trade plan will eliminate the use of of 80% of the energy that we presently use? Can you drive 80% less miles to work? On a sub-freezing day, can you run your thermostat 80% lower? Can you use your lights 80% less with a major impact on your lives? Can you get buy on 20% of the gasoline that you presently use? And what business will survive these draconian caps placed upon our energy use? And then, where will you find work? Who will pay for your mortgage? Oh by the way, does it make sense now to about why the Federal Reserve is buying up $40 billion dollars worth of mortgage backed securities every month? Hmm, and some people wonder how the powers that be will force the rest of us into stack and pack cities. America, you have just seen your collective future.</p>
<p>Does it makes sense to you that DHS has purchased 2.2 billion rounds of ammo and 2700 armored personnel carriers? The globalists forces know what is coming. It is time that this country wake up and smell the coffee. You have been conquered, America, and many of you will not survive. And if you doubt the words that I have posted here, lets have Obama tell you so in his own words.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/zimmermanposter3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/zimmermanposter2.jpg" align="left" /></a>After the Zimmerman verdict, Black Panther activist Malik Shabazz told audiences that blacks must retaliate, “You want freedom you must go out and kill some crackers.”</p>
<p>Thousands of African-Americans marched in protest of the “innocent” verdict for Hispanic Zimmerman.  Ironically, no whites threatened blacks after the “innocent” verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial where he killed his wife and her new boyfriend with a knife.  If you questioned that verdict, or the racial makeup of the jury &#8212; you were a racist.  This past weekend, a jury found Hispanic  George Zimmerman, innocent.  If you&#8217;re not out on the street complaining about it &#8212; you&#8217;re a racist.  Would this have even been a national story if the killer turned up black and the victim happened to be white? Not a peep from the national media.  Black on white crime occurs daily without media attention.</p>
<p>With endless irony, in the 513 days since Zimmerman dispatched Trayvon Martin, 11,300 black people suffered deaths at the hands of nearly that same amount of black people.  In other words, blacks kill blacks with growing alacrity.</p>
<p>Another black leader yelled to kill whites, but a blogger responded, “Who will pay for your welfare checks and grow your food?”</p>
<p>A blogger named SemperFiDave made an interesting comment, “Has there ever been such focused inattention as the case has produced? Nothing of importance is noticed, and everything lacking it is. The crucial fact to come out of the whole adventure—crucial, and therefore utterly overlooked&#8211;was that  Rachel Jeantel, a prosecution witness and black girl aged nineteen years, can´t read. The grim implication of this fact is confirmed by the illiteracy of tweets from blacks regarding the case. “Ima kill dat dumass cracker be racis.” Here we see as neatly displayed as if in a jewelry box why so many young blacks will go nowhere in the remaining fifty years of their lives. They can´t read, or barely can. In a fading techno-industrial civilization—I use the latter word frivolously—this consigns them to a life on charity. Is this not of more note than who started what?”</p>
<p>Black illiteracy starts with the 76 percent high school dropout/flunkout rate in areas like Detroit, MI as reported by Brian Williams at NBC.  Most other major cities feature at least 50 to 60 percent black dropout rates from high schools.  A whopping 68 percent of black children face life with a single mother and 99 percent of them live on welfare checks, assisted housing and food stamps. (Source: Dotty Lamm of the Denver Post)  A huge percentage of blacks utilize food stamps out of the 47 million Americans dependent on the program. A mind numbing 40 percent of African-American men lack jobs because they lack a high school diploma and skills.  They suffer functional illiteracy: cannot read, write or perform simple math.</p>
<p>We see a self-induced complete breakdown of the black family unit in America that rivals anything in America’s history.  Entrenched poverty, illiteracy and joblessness faces  40 to 50 percent of black Americans.  Blacks find themselves in the richest country in the world with endless opportunities, but they drop out of school to insure their misery.</p>
<p><b>Black racism more vocal than white racism</b></p>
<p>SemperfiDave continued, “A measure of the limitless hypocrisy that pervades, that almost constitutes American political life is that Trayvon´s clear racial hostility from his Facebook rants—“creepy-ass cracker”—is ignored. Only whites can exhibit racial antagonism. Yet perhaps twice a week on the Drudge Report one encounters cell-phone video of young blacks seriously beating whites because they are white. Here you have to understand that racial attacks are not racial. The local police chief invariably says that race wasn´t involved, when in fact nothing else was, and the papers will speak of “teens.””</p>
<p>At some point, blacks and whites must come to terms with their biological separateness, but move toward respect toward each other.  At some points, black leaders must encourage educational perseverance in every black youth, or many blacks will remain illiterate, jobless and hopelessly meshed in poverty.</p>
<p>Dave finished, “Anyone of sufficient intelligence can see that race relations in America are bad and getting worse. However, to judge by commentary regarding Zimmerman, very few meet this demanding intellectual standard. People achieving a lesser standard, partial sentience perhaps, can see that until blacks decide to essay literacy, even education, things will stay the same or deteriorate. The latter is the assured outcome. Why Jesse and Al don´t point this out to their constituents is, unfortunately, obvious, the purpose of race hustling being to profit the hustler.”</p>
<p>Finally, Barack Obama, half white and half black, must come to terms with black-white America instead of hovering above it.  Unless he creates something remarkable like FDR’s CCC and other acronyms that engage, employ and thrust illiteracy-stricken blacks out of the ghettoes, we find ourselves facing scabrous times without end.  “Ima kill dat dumass cracker be racis” will grow worse with black flash mobs killing whites and unending poverty engulfing an entire ethnic group in America.</p>
<p>Solutions:</p>
<p>1.      Stop importing 100,000 legal immigrants every 30 days that displace America’s working poor, particularly America blacks.</p>
<p>2.      Enforce employment immigration laws within America by DHS to give jobs to American blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>3.      Create job programs for Hispanics and blacks in every major city.</p>
<p>4.      Create after school recreation centers, job training and counselors in every inner city.</p>
<p>5.      Fund those activities by ceasing foreign wars and foreign intervention with military bases all over the world.</p>
<p>6.      Gather America’s top blacks like Colin Powell and create a series of infomercials that engage all minorities to lift themselves up with pride, honor and purpose.</p>

<p>Current scandals aside, when the history of the Obama Administration is written the topic of crony capitalism will need a section to itself. From the high profile failures of green energy projects to the bailouts of Wall Street and Detroit, handing out taxpayer dollars to private industry is a hallmark of the president’s economic policy. But President Obama is not alone responsible for approving these giveaways. Congress has played a critical role, especially when it comes to subsidies to Hollywood and the recording industry.</p>
<p>Instapundit.com creator, Glenn Reynolds, has done yeoman’s work connecting the dots. He has extensively documented how the “content industry” has taken advantage of the tax credits and subsides on the federal, state and local levels, to pad their bottom line. But Hollywood’s biggest giveaways don’t occur on the tax-writing committees in Congress but the Judiciary Committee — where copyright policy is written.</p>
<p>Using every means at their disposal, Hollywood has attacked the balanced approach inherent in our Constitution. Unfortunately, members of both parties have played the game that has stifled economic growth and competition and given the content lobby their near every demand. In short, Congress continues to look for more draconian ways to help copyright holders enforce their copyrights without regard to the impact on users and consumers.</p>
<p>That’s why it was a pleasant surprise to hear House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) announce a comprehensive review of copyright law. Goodlatte’s “Copyright Principles Project,” is an effort to build consensus around copyright laws between consumers, the content lobby and technology. Yet supporters of free market reforms viewed the announcement with both optimism and skepticism. There have been few supporters of reform within both parties and Mr. Goodlatte does not have a good track record of support for free market principles on these issues. But one can hope.</p>
<p>There are a number of reforms Mr. Goodlatte can endorse that will benefit consumers and help re-balance the law. Among them:</p>
<p>Unlocking Your Phone — When you buy a phone it is married to a specific wireless carrier. You can’t take it and go to another one because the cost of it was subsidized by the carrier with which you signed a contract. If, when that contract expires, you decide to switch to another carrier, or if you decide to pay the penalty and end your contract early for whatever reason, you, as the owner of the phone, become the proud owner of a technologically advanced and expensive paperweight. Your phone won’t work with another service provider. It would be like buying a car that you can never paint or change the radio, it has to be kept the same way it was when you bought it or it won’t work. You own it, technically, but General Motors controls it. There’s really nothing else you can buy that you, as the owner, have so little control over. Millions have been spent on lobbying to create and maintain this system.</p>
<p>Internet Radio — Internet radio is booming in popularity but the royalty scheme makes the model unprofitable. Internet radio websites pay six times the royalty rates of other broadcast mediums because the Copyright Royalty Board imposes price-fixing on the industry with standards created by Congress. Determining what standard applies depends on whether or not the service was &#8220;preexisting&#8221; in 1998 when the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was enacted. New technologies are subject to a standard that results in much higher rates than those faced by &#8220;old&#8221; technologies like satellite radio. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) introduced in the last Congress the Internet Radio Fairness Act, which seeks to fix the royalty rate mess. It should be a high priority for the Chairman.</p>
<p>Politicians on both sides of the aisle constantly rail against cronyism, yet both sides engage in it hoping you won’t notice. The “safeguards” built into that cronyism to protect the patrons of it are set up in such a way that you, the consumer, will place the blame elsewhere rather than where it ultimately belongs – the government. Companies use government as a weapon against competitors and consumers, companies know it and embrace it, consumers are kept in the dark.</p>
<p>Like how a raise in the gas tax is blamed on “greedy oil companies” for raising the price rather than government because consumers only see the end price at the pump without knowing it’s higher because their elected officials want a bigger slice, cronyism impacts you elsewhere. The company that makes your phone isn’t keeping you from using it however you want, and if your favorite Internet radio station goes away it won’t be because they couldn’t compete on a level playing field, an entire system has been set up to make it difficult, if not near impossible for them to exist. It’s just the way it is, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rabbiMouth3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rabbiMouth2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Every so often we come across a secular Jewish ‘anti’ Zionist’  who argues that Zionism is not Judaism and vice versa. Interestingly enough, I have just come across an invaluable text that illuminates this question from a rabbinical perspective. Apparently back in 1942, 757 American Rabbis added their names to a public pronouncement titled ‘Zionism an Affirmation of Judaism’. This Rabbinical rally for Zionism was declared at the time “the largest public pronouncement in all Jewish history.”</p>
<p align="left">Today, we tend to believe that world Jewry’s transition towards support for Israel followed the 1967 war though some might  argue that already in 1948, American Jews manifested a growing support for Zionism. However, this rabbinical pronouncement proves that as early as 1942, the American Jewish religious establishment was already deeply Zionist. And if this is not enough, the rabbis also regarded Zionism as the ‘implementation’ of Judaism. Seemingly, already then, the peak of World War two, the overwhelming majority of American Rabbis regarded Zionism, not only as fully consistent with Judaism, but as a “logical expression and implementation of it.”</p>
<p align="left">In spite of the fact that early Zionist leaders were largely secular and the East European Jewish settler waves were driven by Jewish socialist ideology, the rabbis contend that “Zionism is not a secularist movement. It has its origins and roots in the authoritative religious texts of Judaism.</p>
<p align="left">Those rabbis were not a bunch of ignoramuses. They were patriotic and nationalistic and they grasped that “universalism is not a contradiction of nationalism.” The rabbis tried to differentiate between contemporaneous German Nationalism and other national movements and they definitely wanted to believe that Zionism was categorically different to Nazism. “Nationalism as such, whether it be English, French, American or Jewish, is not in itself evil. It is only militaristic and chauvinistic nationalism, that nationalism which shamelessly flouts all mandates of international morality, which is evil.” But as we know, just three years after the liberation of Auschwitz the new Jewish State launched a devastating racially driven ethnic-cleansing campaign. Zionism has proven to be militaristic and chauvinistic.</p>
<p align="left">Shockingly enough, back in 1942 as many as 757 American rabbis were able to predict the outcome of the war and they realised that the suffering of European Jewry would be translated into a Jewish State . “We are not so bold as to predict the nature of the international order which will emerge from the present war. It is altogether likely, and indeed it may be desirable, that all sovereign states shall under the coming peace surrender some of their sovereignty to achieve a just and peaceful world society (a Jewish State).”</p>
<p align="left">Some American patriots today are concerned with Israeli-American dual nationality and the dual aspirations of American Jews. Apparently our rabbis addressed this topic too. According to them, there is no such conflict whatsoever. All American Jews are American patriots and all American decision makers are Zionists. “Every fair-minded American knows that American Jews have only one political allegiance&#8211;and that is to America. There is nothing in Zionism to impair this loyalty. Zionism has been endorsed in our generation by every President from Woodrow Wilson to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and has been approved by the Congress of the United States. The noblest spirits in American life, statesmen, scholars, writers, ministers and leaders of labor and industry, have lent their sympathy and encouragement to the movement.”</p>
<p align="left">Back in 1942 our American rabbis were bold enough to state that defeating Hitler was far from sufficient. For them, a full solution of the Jewish question could only take place in Palestine. “Jews, and all non-Jews who are sympathetically interested in the plight of Jewry, should bear in mind that the defeat of Hitler will not of itself normalize Jewish life in Europe. “</p>
<p align="left">But there was one thing the American rabbis failed to mention – the Palestinian people. For some reason, those rabbis who knew much about ‘universalism’ and in particular Jewish ‘universalism’ showed very little concern to the people of the land. I guess that after all, chosennss is a form of blindness and rabbis probably know more about this than anyone else.</p>

<p align="left">ZIONISM AN AFFIRMATION OF JUDAISM A Reply by 757 Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Rabbis of America to a Statement Issued by Ninety Members of the Reform Rabbinate Charging That Zionism Is Incompatible with the Teachings of Judaism</p>
<p align="left">THE SUBJOINED REPLY was prepared at the initiative of the following Rabbis who submitted it to their colleagues throughout the country for signature: Philip S. Bernstein, Barnett R. Brickner, Israel Goldstein, James G. Heller, Mordecai M. Kaplan, B. L. Levinthal, Israel H. Levinthal, Louis M. Levitsky, Joshua Loth Liebman, Joseph H. Lookstein, Jacob R. Marcus, Abraham A. Neuman, Louis I. Newman, David de Sola Pool, Abba Hillel Silver, Milton Steinberg, and Stephen S. Wise.</p>
<p align="left">WE, THE UNDERSIGNED RABBIS of all elements in American Jewish religious life, have noted with concern a statement by ninety of our colleagues in which they repudiate Zionism on the ground that it is inconsistent with Jewish religious and moral doctrine.This statement misrepresents Zionism and misinterprets historic Jewish religious teaching, and we should be derelict in our duty if we did not correct the misapprehensions which it is likely to foster.</p>
<p align="left">We call attention in the first place to the fact that the signatories to this statement, for whom as fellow-Rabbis we have a high regard, represent no more than a very small fraction of the American rabbinate. They constitute a minority even of the rabbinate of Reform Judaism with which they are associated. The overwhelming majority of American Rabbis regard Zionism not only as fully consistent with Judaism but as a logical expression and implementation of it.</p>
<p align="left">Our colleagues concede the need for Jewish immigration into Palestine as contributing towards a solution of the vast tragedy of Jewish homelessness. They profess themselves ready to encourage such settlement. They are aware of the important achievements, social and spiritual, of the Palestinian Jewish community and they pledge to it their unstinted support. And yet, subscribing to every practical accomplishment of Zionism, they have embarked upon a public criticism of it. In explanation of their opposition they advance the consideration that Zionism is nationalistic and secularistic. On both scores they maintain it is incompatible with the Jewish religion and its universalistic outlook. They protest against the political emphasis which, they say, is now paramount in the Zionist program and which, according to them, tends to confuse both Jews and Christians as to the place and function of the Jewish group in American society. They appeal to the prophets of ancient Israel for substantiation of their views.</p>
<p align="left">TREASURING the doctrines and moral principles of our faith no less than they, devoted equally to America and its democratic processes and spirit, we nonetheless find every one of their contentions totally without foundation.</p>
<p align="left">Zionism is not a secularist movement. It has its origins and roots in the authoritative religious texts of Judaism. Scripture and rabbinical literature alike are replete with the promise of the restoration of Israel to its ancestral home. Anti-Zionism, not Zionism, is a departure from the Jewish religion. Nothing in the entire pronouncement of our colleagues is more painful than their appeal to the prophets of Israel—to those very prophets whose inspired and recorded words of national rebirth and restoration nurtured and sustained the hope of Israel throughout the ages.</p>
<p align="left">Nor is Zionism a denial of the universalistic teachings of Judaism. Universalism is not a contradiction of nationalism. Nationalism as such, whether it be English, French, American or Jewish, is not in itself evil. It is only militaristic and chauvinistic nationalism, that nationalism which shamelessly flouts all mandates of international morality, which is evil. The prophets of Israel looked forward to the time not when all national entities would be obliterated, but when all nations would walk in the light of the Lord, live by His law and learn war no more.</p>
<p align="left">Our colleagues find themselves unable to subscribe to the political emphasis &#8220;now paramount in the Zionist program.&#8221; We fail to perceive what it is to which they object. Is it to the fact that there are a regularly constituted Zionist organization and a Jewish Agency which deal with the mandatory government, the Colonial office, the League of Nations and other recognized political bodies? But obviously, even immigration and colonization are practical matters which require political action. The settlement of a half million Jews in Palestine since the last war was made possible by political action which culminated in the Balfour Declaration and the Palestine Mandate. There can be little hope of opening the doors of Palestine for mass Jewish immigration after the war without effective political action. Or is it that they object to the ultimate achievement by the Jewish community of Palestine of some form of Jewish statehood? We are not so bold as to predict the nature of the international order which will emerge from the present war. It is altogether likely, and indeed it may be desirable, that all sovereign states shall under the coming peace surrender some of their sovereignty to achieve a just and peaceful world society.</p>
<p align="left">Certainly our colleagues will allow to the Jews of Palestine the same rights that are allowed to all other peoples resident on their own land. If Jews should ultimately come to constitute a majority of the population of Palestine, would our colleagues suggest that all other peoples in the post-war world shall be entitled to political self-determination, whatever form that may take, but the Jewish people in Palestine shall not have such a right? Or do they mean to suggest that the Jews in Palestine shall forever remain a minority in order not to achieve such political self-determination?</p>
<p align="left">PROTESTING their sympathy both for the homeless Jews of the world and for their brethren in Palestine, our colleagues have by their pronouncement done all these a grave disservice. It may well be that to the degree to which their efforts arc at all effective, Jews who might otherwise have found a haven in Palestine will be denied one. The enemies of the Jewish homeland will be strengthened in their propaganda as a result of the aid which these Rabbis have given them. To the Jews of Palestine, facing the gravest danger in their history and fighting hard to maintain morale and hope in the teeth of the totalitarian menace, this pronouncement comes as a cruel blow.</p>
<p align="left">We do not mean to imply that our colleagues intended it as such. We have no doubt that they are earnest about their fine spun theoretical objections to Zionism. We hold, however, that these objections have no merit, and further that voicing them at this time has been unwise and unkind.</p>
<p align="left">We have not the least fear that our fellow Americans will be led to misconstrue the attitudes of American Jews to America because of their interest in Zionism. Every fair-minded American knows that American Jews have only one political allegiance&#8211;and that is to America. There is nothing in Zionism to impair this loyalty. Zionism has been endorsed in our generation by every President from Woodrow Wilson to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and has been approved by the Congress of the United States. The noblest spirits in American life, statesmen, scholars, writers, ministers and leaders of labor and industry, have lent their sympathy and encouragement to the movement.</p>
<p align="left">Jews, and all non-Jews who are sympathetically interested in the plight of Jewry, should bear in mind that the defeat of Hitler will not of itself normalize Jewish life in Europe.</p>
<p align="left">An Allied peace which will not frankly face the problem of the national homelessness of the Jewish people will leave the age-old tragic status of European Jewry unchanged. The Jewish people is in danger of emerging from this war not only more torn and broken than any other people, but also without any prospects of a better and more secure future and without the hope that such tragedies will not recur again, and again. Following an Allied victory, the Jews of Europe, we are confident, will be restored to their political rights and to equality of citizenship. But they possessed these rights after the last war and yet the past twenty-five years have witnessed a rapid and appalling deterioration in their position. In any case, even after peace is restored Europe will be so ravaged and war-torn that large masses of Jews will elect migration to Palestine as a solution of their personal problems.</p>
<p align="left"> Indeed, for most of these there may be no other substantial hope of economic, social and spiritual rehabilitation.</p>
<p align="left">THE freedom which, we have faith, will come to all men and nations after this war, must come not only to Jews as individuals wherever they live, permitting them to share freedom on a plane of equality with all other men, but also to the Jewish people, as such, restored in its homeland, where at long last it will be a free people within a world federation of free peoples.</p>
<p align="left">Of the 757 Rabbis listed below, 214 are members of the Central Conference of American Rabbis (Reform); 247 are members of the Rabbinical Assembly of America (Conservative); and the rest are affiliated with the Rabbinical Council of America (Orthodox) or the Union of Orthodox Rabbis. The total represents the largest number of rabbis whose signatures are attached to a public pronouncement in all Jewish history.</p>

			<div class="date">
				<p>April 18, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17315#respond" title="Comment on The 1965 Congressional Lie On Immigration; The 2013 Lie Even Bigger"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17315 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17315">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/liarsCARTOON3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/liarsCARTOON2.jpg" align="left" /></a>In 1965, as a college student, I felt the U.S. Government and Congress worked for and represented the best interests of the American people.  As I learned more, and later as I understood more as a U.S. Army officer, I discovered presidents and Congress lie.  When I became a math-science teacher in Denver, Colorado, I discovered that superintendents lie when it benefits them.  I discovered people lie.</p>
<p>Lyndon Baines Johnson lied to plunge us into the Vietnam War. Bill Clinton lied from the day of his birth.  George W. Bush lied us into Iraq War.  Barack H. Obama continually lies to us as to immigration, Afghanistan War, Obamacare, his past history and more than we can count.</p>
<p>But the one lie that will go down in history as the beginning of the end of the United States of America goes to the late Senator Teddy Kennedy (D-MA) and his 1965 Immigration Reform Act. He exploded immigration from 175,000 annually to over 1.2 million year after year, decade after decade.  He jumped our population from a reasonable 194 million to its current 316 million on our way to 625 million in this century.</p>
<p>In front of Congress he said, “First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same.  Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset. Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>“In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think.  The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants.  It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society.   It will not relax the standards of admission. The bill will not place a burden on the legal citizens by increasing taxes to pay the huge costs for care-and-feeding, medical care, education, etc of the &#8220;immigrants&#8221;&#8230; and additional social-services for their family members.  It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.” [Ted Kennedy at Judiciary Committee hearing on Feb. 10, 1965, commenting on the Hart-Celler Act]</p>
<p>Kennedy’s bill DID flood the country with another 100 million people. It created intractable poverty and entrenched illiteracy.  It created cultural conflicts being played out across America in 2013, i.e. Mexicans battling African-Americans in Los Angeles, Muslims taking over entire cities like Detroit and running out everyone else; it imported many third world immigrants lost in the morass of this high speed society and unable to assimilate. We feature “Black flash mobs” terrorizing citizens in Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Chicago.  We feature female genital mutilation, arranged marriages and honor killings in America in 2013.  We see exploding illiteracy rates among citizens.  We house 47 million people who cannot secure a job: thus, they exist on food stamps.  Over 14 million Americans cannot secure a job at a living wage.</p>
<p>This new Comprehensive Immigration Bill expects to swamp our country with another 100 million immigrants within 37 years.  From 2050, we face another 200 million beyond that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Congress, led by a “Gang of Eight” senators expects to unload the gates of hell upon our country.  Not only will Congress give total amnesty to 20 million, they in turn, can and will chain-migrate endless millions of their families into our country.  This thing will become SO ugly on SO many levels, but we will become the victims and no one wins and everyone loses.</p>
<p>Amazingly enough, after the failure of the 1986 amnesty, our borders remain as porous as ever. Nothing in this bill shows any intention of enforcing past or current immigration employment, housing or transporting of illegal migrant laws. Thus, illegals will careen into our country in ever greater numbers.</p>
<p>Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said, “This is not amnesty — amnesty is the forgiveness of something. We’re going to create an alternative that says OK, you want to stay here, you’ll have to wait more than 10 years, you’ll have to pay this fine, you’ll have to pay your registration fee, you’ll have to be gainfully employed, you won’t qualify for any federal benefit, and then after all of that you don’t get to apply for anything until the enforcement mechanisms are in place.”</p>
<p>Schumer lies like a rug, like Al Capone, like a snake, like the 19 terrorists who flew airplanes into the Twin Towers and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The truth:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the bill becomes law, every single illegal alien in America becomes legal.</li>
<li>Legal status will never be revoked; it can and will only be expanded with every inevitable subsequent act of Congress.</li>
<li>This amnesty will leader to more amnesties for millions of other aliens crossing our borders or overstaying their visas.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you expect to save your own rear end and that of your children’s future, I implore you to join the following organizations for free and start sending pre-written faxes to your reps to defeat this bill.</p>

			<p><img alt="Why Are Major Retail Chains All Over America Collapsing? -  Photo by Gars129" src="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Why-Are-Major-Retail-Chains-All-Over-America-Collapsing-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" />If the economy is improving, then why are many of the largest retail chains in America closing hundreds of stores?  When I was growing up, Sears, J.C. Penney, Best Buy and RadioShack were all considered to be unstoppable retail powerhouses.  But now it is being projected that all of them will close <strong>hundreds</strong> of stores before the end of 2013.  Even Wal-Mart is running into problems.  A recent internal Wal-Mart memo that was <a title="leaked to Bloomberg" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-15/wal-mart-executives-sweat-slow-february-start-in-e-mails.html" target="_blank">leaked to Bloomberg</a>described February sales as a &#8220;total disaster&#8221;.  So why is this happening?  Why are major retail chains all over America collapsing?  Is the &#8220;retail apocalypse&#8221; upon us?  Well, the truth is that this is just another sign that the U.S. economy is falling apart right in front of our eyes.  Incomes are declining, taxes are going up, government dependence is at an all-time high, and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the percentage of the U.S. labor force that is employed <a title="has been steadily falling" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/shocking-numbers-that-show-the-media-is-lying-to-you-about-unemployment-in-america">has been steadily falling</a> since 2006.  The top 10% of all income earners in the U.S. are <a title="still doing very well" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-u-s-has-an-even-larger-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-than-downton-abbey-does">still doing very well</a>, but most U.S. consumers are either flat broke or are drowning in debt.  The large disposable incomes that the big retail chains have depended upon in the past simply are not there anymore.  So retail chains all over the United States are now closing up unprofitable stores.  This is especially true in low income areas.</p>
<p>When you step back and take a look at the bigger picture, the rapid decline of some of our largest retail chains really is stunning.</p>
<p>It is happening already in some areas, but soon half empty malls and boarded up storefronts will litter the landscapes of cities all over America.</p>
<p>Just check out some of these store closing numbers for 2013.  These numbers are from a recent <a title="Yahoo Finance article" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/eight-retailers-that-will-close-the-most-stores-173320796.html?page=1" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance article</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Best Buy</strong></p>
<p>Forecast store closings: 200 to 250</p>
<p><strong>Sears Holding Corp.</strong></p>
<p>Forecast store closings: Kmart 175 to 225, Sears 100 to 125</p>
<p><strong>J.C. Penney</strong></p>
<p>Forecast store closings: 300 to 350</p>
<p><strong>Office Depot</strong></p>
<p>Forecast store closings: 125 to 150</p>
<p><strong>Barnes &amp; Noble</strong></p>
<p>Forecast store closings: 190 to 240, per company comments</p>
<p><strong>Gamestop</strong></p>
<p>Forecast store closings: 500 to 600</p>
<p><strong>OfficeMax</strong></p>
<p>Forecast store closings: 150 to 175</p>
<p><strong>RadioShack</strong></p>
<p>Forecast store closings: 450 to 550</p>
<p>The RadioShack in a nearby town just closed up where I live.  This is all happening so fast that it is hard to believe.</p>
<p>But the truth is that those store closings are not the entire story.  When you dig deeper you find a lot more retailers that are in trouble.</p>
<p>For example, Blockbuster recently announced that this year they will be closing about 300 stores and eliminating <a title="about 3,000 jobs" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blockbuster-closures-layoffs-2013-1" target="_blank">about 3,000 jobs</a>.</p>
<p>Toy manufacturer Hasbro recently announced that they will be reducing the size of their workforce <a title="by about 10 percent" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324539304578263621911705756.html" target="_blank">by about 10 percent</a>.</p>
<p>Even Wal-Mart is going through a tough stretch right now.  According to documents that were leaked <a title="to Bloomberg" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-15/wal-mart-executives-sweat-slow-february-start-in-e-mails.html" target="_blank">to Bloomberg</a>, Wal-Mart is having an absolutely disastrous February&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. had the worst sales start to a month in seven years as payroll-tax increases hit shoppers already battling a slow economy, according to internal e-mails obtained by Bloomberg News.</p>
<p>“In case you haven’t seen a sales report these days, February MTD sales are a total disaster,” Jerry Murray, Wal- Mart’s vice president of finance and logistics, said in a Feb. 12 e-mail to other executives, referring to month-to-date sales. “The worst start to a month I have seen in my ~7 years with the company.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So what in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>The <a title="mainstream media" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/mainstream-media">mainstream media</a> continues to proclaim that we are experiencing a robust &#8220;economic recovery&#8221;, but at the same time there are a whole host of indications that things are continually getting worse.</p>
<p>Even global cell phone sales <a title="actually declined slightly" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-02-13/global-mobile-phone-sales-post-first-decline-2009" target="_blank">actually declined slightly</a> in 2012.  That was the first time that has happened since the last recession.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time that we faced the truth.  The <a title="middle class" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/middle-class">middle class</a> is shrinking, incomes are declining and there are not nearly as many jobs as there used to be.</p>
<p>Mort Zuckerman pointed this out in a recent article <a title="in the Wall Street Journal" href="http://www.bizzyblog.com/2013/02/16/mort-zuckerman-gets-it-by-any-measure-the-jobs-disaster-continues/" target="_blank">in the Wall Street Journal</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. labor market, which peaked in November 2007 when there were 139,143,000 jobs, now encompasses only 132,705,000 workers, a drop of 6.4 million jobs from the peak. <strong>The only work that has increased is part-time, and that is because it allows employers to reduce costs</strong> through a diminished benefit package or none at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>So how can the mainstream media be talking about how &#8220;good&#8221; things are if we still have 6.4 million fewer jobs than we had back in November 2007?</p>
<p>And sadly, things may soon be getting a lot worse.  If Congress does not do anything about the &#8220;sequester&#8221;, millions of federal workers may shortly be facing some very painful furloughs according to <a title="CNN" href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/17/news/economy/federal-worker-furloughs/index.html?iid=Lead" target="_blank">CNN</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal workers could start facing furloughs as early as April, according to federal agencies trying to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>Unless Congress steps in, some $85 billion in massive spending reductions will hit the federal government, doling out furloughs to much of the nation&#8217;s 2.1 million federal workforce, experts say.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you still live in an area of the country where the stores and the restaurants are booming, you should be very thankful because that is not the reality for most of the country.</p>
<p>I often write about the stunning economic decline of major cities such as <a title="Detroit" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/detroit">Detroit</a>, but there are huge sections of rural America that are in even worse shape than Detroit in many ways.</p>
<p>For example, many Indian reservations all over America have been shamefully neglected by the federal government and have become hotbeds for crime, drugs and poverty.</p>
<p>Business Insider recently profiled the Wind River Indian reservation in western Wyoming.  The following is a brief excerpt from that<a title="outstanding article" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/wind-river-indian-reservation-in-wyoming-2013-2#" target="_blank">outstanding article</a>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Wind River Indian Reservation is not an easy place to get to, but I had to see it for myself.</p>
<p>Thirty-five-hundred square miles of prairie and mountains in western Wyoming, the reservation is home to bitter ancestral enemies: the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes.</p>
<p>Even among reservations, it&#8217;s renowned for brutal crime, widespread drug use, and legal dumping of toxic waste.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see some amazing photos of the Wind River Indian reservation<a title="right here" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/wind-river-indian-reservation-in-wyoming-2013-2#" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that there are places like that in America, but the truth is that conditions like that are spreading to more U.S. communities with each passing day.</p>
<p>We are a nation that is in an advanced state of decline.  But as long as the financial markets are okay, our leaders don&#8217;t seem too concerned about the suffering that everyone else is going through.</p>
<p>In fact, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan essentially admitted as much during a recent interview with CNBC.  The following is how a <a title="Zero Hedge article" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-02-15/greenspan-ignore-economy-only-stock-market-matters" target="_blank">Zero Hedge article</a> summarized that interview&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Starting at around 1:50, Greenspan states the odds of sequester occurring are very high &#8211; in fact, the playdough-faced ex-Chair-head notes, &#8220;I find it very difficult to find a scenario in which [the sequester] doesn&#8217;t happen&#8221; But when asked how this will affect the economy, Awkward Alan is unusually clearly spoken - <strong>&#8220;the issue is how does it affect the stock market.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>While not so many of our leaders have taken the path to direct truthiness, Greenspan somewhat shocks a Botox&#8217;d and babbling Bartiromo when he admits <strong>&#8220;the stock market is the key player in the game of economic growth.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Bartiromo shifts uncomfortably in her seat, strokes her imaginary beard and stares blankly as Greenspan explains that while the sequester will have a real effect on the real economy, <strong>&#8220;if the stock market can hold up through this, then the effect will be rather minor.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Do you see?</p>
<p>As long as the stock market is moving higher they think that everything is just fine and dandy.</p>
<p>And the Obama administration?</p>
<p>They continue to pursue the same policies that got us into this mess.</p>
<p>Their idea of &#8220;economic reform&#8221; is to <a title="threaten to sue businesses" href="http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/eeoc-federal-crime-convicts/2013/02/15/id/490605?s=al&amp;promo_code=12791-1" target="_blank">threaten to sue businesses</a>that do not hire ex-convicts.</p>
<p>And of course now that Obama has been re-elected he is putting a tremendous amount of effort into &#8220;stimulating the economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, he spent this weekend <a title="golfing in Florida" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-15/obama-eases-into-second-term-with-weekend-of-golf-in-florida.html" target="_blank">golfing in Florida</a>, and the Obamas recently spent <a title="about 20 million taxpayer dollars" href="http://www.whitehousedossier.com/2013/01/04/taxpayer-bill-obamas-hawaii-vacations-20-million/" target="_blank">about 20 million taxpayer dollars</a> vacationing in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is getting worse with each passing day.</p>
<p>If you doubt that economic conditions are getting worse, please read this article: &#8220;<a title="Show This To Anyone That Believes That 'Things Are Getting Better' In America" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/show-this-to-anyone-that-believes-that-things-are-getting-better-in-america">Show This To Anyone That Believes That &#8216;Things Are Getting Better&#8217; In America</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>When you look at the cold, hard numbers, it is undeniable what is happening to America.</p>
<p>And our leaders are not doing anything to fix our problems.  In fact, most of the time they are just making things worse.</p>
<p>So buckle up and get prepared.  We are in for very bumpy ride, and this is only just the beginning.</p>
