<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Culprits Include The City Of Chicago, Big Retailers, The Media, And Churches&#8230;</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Proponents of the Nanny State have been trying to take away man’s Natural right of self-defense ever since the United Nations was created back in 1945. Of course, the Natural right of self-defense is totally unknown in communist and socialist countries; and big-government toadies in several so-called “democratic” countries have also succeeded in turning citizens into subjects by removing or severely restricting the Natural right of self-defense. Obviously, I’m talking about countries such as Great Britain, France, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By self-defense, I am talking about a man’s right to carry a Personal Defense Weapon (PDW)&#8211;which, in modern times, mostly requires a firearm&#8211;anywhere and everywhere he goes. A state that does not allow a man to be personally armed in his day-to-day activities is literally stripping him of his right of self-defense. To require a citizen to keep his or her PDW in their home or vehicle is to deny the citizen’s Natural right of self-defense. To say a citizen may lawfully protect himself in only limited and duly-prescribed locations is to make the citizen a subject of the state. Furthermore, it removes from him the most fundamental of all the Natural rights that were granted to him by his Creator: the right of self-defense.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Four-legged predators are constantly on the prowl for animals that are defenseless. Two-legged predators do the same thing. These human predators do not respect “gun-free” zones. Like all predators, they are opportunistic beasts. They prey on the weak and vulnerable. When the state takes away a person’s right to be always armed, it makes the entire citizenry weak and vulnerable. As I have said many times, guns don’t kill people; gun-free zones kill people.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Gun control laws are among the most egregious violations of Natural Law. Men and women who are truly free are allowed to carry a PDW everywhere they go. Banks, schools, government buildings, churches, etc., should be no exceptions. It is no coincidence that just about every single mass-shooting in recent memory has taken place in a so-called “gun-free” zone, where the only people who were armed were the perpetrators. Gun-free zones turn free men into human prey.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For all intents and purposes, several states and major cities within the United States have become “gun-free” zones, in that they mostly deny their citizens the right to carry a PDW on their person. Whether the people of these cities and states realize it or not, they have lost the right to be called free men and have been turned into human prey by their own State and municipal governments. There is no greater example of this tyranny than the city of Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Chicago has some of the strictest and most stringent gun-control laws in the entire nation. The government of Chicago has, in effect, turned the town into a giant killing-field where ravenous two-legged beasts are allowed to feast on the millions of defenseless prey that inhabit our country’s third largest city. For example, over the past Independence Day weekend, 82 people were shot and 14 people were killed in Chicago violence. Breitbart.com covered the story:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Breitbart reported that the violence was high on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning, but when Thursday, the final hours of Sunday, and the first few hours of Monday morning were added to the accounting, the rate of violence proved to be even more appalling.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“On Monday morning, July 7, the Chicago Tribune shocked the city with the list of weekend violence reporting that between Thursday, as the holiday weekend began, to the early hours of Monday morning, Chicago experienced 82 shootings with 14 killed.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Included in the Breitbart report is the fact that one man’s life was actually saved by virtue of the fact that he had a concealed carry permit (no small feat in the City of Chicago) and used his PDW to protect himself against three violent miscreants. In this case, one of the dead was a violent predator. Had the innocent citizen not been armed, he would have been the statistic. In addition, the report states that eight of the dead were at the hands of Chicago police officers in the line of duty, proving, once again, that policemen carry guns, not for the protection of the citizenry, but for their own protection.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Predictably, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel blamed the increased violence on “weak” gun laws in the neighboring states of Indiana and Wisconsin.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the Breitbart.com report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Government%2F2014%2F07%2F07%2FBetween-Thursday-and-Sunday-82-shot-and-14-Killed-in-Chicago-Violence&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbYRQWw327UOpyIrUcdH-hESHBLA" target="_blank">Between Thursday And Monday 82 Shot, 14 Killed In Chicago Violence</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, what Emanuel won’t tell you is that the violent crime rates of those states where the right to keep AND BEAR arms is less infringed are far less&#8211;far less! For example, there are 11 states in the country that allow their citizens to carry firearms freely and openly with no permit or license required. Those states are Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota, Vermont, Kentucky, and Virginia. So, using Emanuel’s logic, one could expect that there should have been hundreds of shootings in those states last weekend&#8211;what with their “weak” gun laws and all, right? You know that’s not true.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Check the incidents of shootings in the above-listed states and we might even discover that the City of Chicago may have had more shootings over this past Independence Day weekend than those 11 states COMBINED. Think of it: the City of Chicago (with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country) may have had more shootings than the combined shootings of the 11 states that recognize their citizens’ Natural right of self-defense by allowing them to freely and openly carry a PDW.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, it’s not only various and sundry governments (though they are the most egregious usurpers of the Natural right of self-defense) that want to deny people the right to bear arms; many large retailers are adding their weight to the anti-self-defense hysteria.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Just a few days ago, the giant retailer, Target, announced a corporate policy that asks its patrons to leave their firearms at home. Once again, Breitbart.com covers the story.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“On July 2nd, Target ‘respectfully’ asked law-abiding citizens to ‘not bring firearms’ in their stores.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The department store chain did this via an announcement posted on its website and shared by interim CEO John Mulligan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The announcement says:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘As you&#8217;ve likely seen in the media, there&#8217;s been a debate about whether guests in communities that permit &#8220;open carry&#8221; should be allowed to bring firearms into Target stores. Our approach has always been to follow local laws, and of course, we will continue to do so. But starting today we will respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target&#8211;even in communities where it is permitted by law.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“By taking this step, Target joins Chipotle, Jack in the Box, Sonic, and Chili&#8217;s in asking law-abiding citizens not to carry guns in their businesses.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The author of the report, AWR Hawkins, notes, “Within two weeks of asking law-abiding customers to come unarmed, two Jack in the Box stores were robbed, and a shooting took place at a third. Patrons were robbed at gunpoint in one of the robberies, as well.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report at:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Government%2F2014%2F07%2F02%2FTarget-Respectfully-Asks-Law-Abiding-Citizens-To-Leave-Guns-At-Home&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgCaOXlkzBuCjOparrSfzdp7f3Wg" target="_blank">Target ‘Respectfully’ Asks Law-Abiding Citizens To Leave Guns At Home</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But the war against your Natural right to self-defense doesn’t stop with the City of Chicago or the Target chain-stores. The mainstream media seem absolutely determined to take away your right to defend yourself and your loved ones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">After CNN sacked Piers Morgan due to his immense unpopularity, which was mostly due to his arrogant attacks against America’s Second Amendment, the cable network recently announced that it was replacing Morgan with former America’s Most Wanted host, John Walsh, who immediately proclaimed that his show would continue Morgan’s attacks against the Second Amendment.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once more, Breitbart.com covers the story:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Former America&#8217;s Most Wanted host John Walsh is hosting a new show on CNN on which he vows to keep the push for gun control and the war on the NRA alive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“According to The Wrap, Walsh said:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘I&#8217;m the father of a murdered child. I&#8217;ve done nothing but track violence in America since my son was murdered. We have a serious problem with guns in this country&#8230; and the NRA solution to arm every grammar-school 80-year-old teacher with a gun is absolutely ludicrous.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“He claims the NRA has gotten so big and financially powerful through relationships with gun manufacturers that ‘they&#8217;re not a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, they&#8217;re a gun manufacturer rep.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Walsh&#8217;s new show, The Hunt, premieres July 13. Walsh says he did not initially realize ‘how much his gun control efforts would be a part of his new show.’”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report at:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Journalism%2F2014%2F07%2F07%2FNew-CNN-Host-John-Walsh-Vows-To-Continue-Piers-Morgan-s-War-On-The-NRA&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwfmG2vLNr1MOFV5FaffJTRQma1Q" target="_blank">New CNN Host John Walsh Vows To Continue Piers Morgan’s War On The NRA</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Obviously, CNN is hoping that it’s continued anti-Second Amendment agenda will be more palatable to the American people if it comes from a fellow American&#8211;especially one with whom everyone can truly sympathize with by virtue of his losing a child to an act of violence (although Adam Walsh’s murder did not involve the use of a firearm)&#8211;than from the arrogant and pompous British elitist, Piers Morgan. But make no mistake about it: the anti-Second Amendment message is the same. Only the messenger has changed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And most sadly, churches, too, are often at the forefront of the anti-self-defense fanaticism. Christian leaders from denominations across the board are often the ones who promote gun control (even gun confiscation) among their congregations and who deny their parishioners the right to be armed on church property.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, back in 2004, the president of the LDS church issued a declaration to all Mormon churches in Utah that gave “public notice that firearms are prohibited in the church’s houses of worship, including temples, meetinghouses, the Assembly Hall, the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and the Conference Center.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The declaration went on to say, “Once such public notice is given, persons who bring firearms into a church house of worship should be informed of the church’s position and politely asked to take their firearms to another safe location. Persons who refuse to take their firearms from the house of worship or repeatedly ignore the church’s prohibition should be referred to local law enforcement officers for possible criminal prosecution.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the church statement here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deseretnews.com%2Farticle%2F590038317%2FText-of-letter-from-First-Presidency-on-guns.html%3Fpg%3Dall&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHuqhHjI2590O9spLI-XV5JN1DZyg" target="_blank">Text Of Letter From First Presidency On Guns</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But if you think the LDS church is the only church in the country that has taken such a position, you are sadly misinformed. My educated guess is that the vast majority of denominations and churches in America have a very similar position.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But instead of denying the Christian people of America from exercising their God-given right of self-defense on church property, church leaders should be boldly teaching the Biblical Natural Law principles of self-defense and encouraging their people to jealously guard this most fundamental liberty. By demanding that Christian people not be armed on church property, church leaders are no better than Rahm Emanuel&#8211;who insists that Chicago’s residents not be allowed to protect themselves&#8211;and are opening up their churches to those two-legged wolves who would seek to devour the sheep.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There are only a small handful of countries today that recognize the Natural right of self-defense. The advent of the United Nations has facilitated the demise of this right in country after country. The United States is the last major power that yet somewhat protects this most precious Natural right.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Obviously, several State and local governments within the United States (not to mention the worst offender of all: the federal government in Washington, D.C.) have themselves assisted the dismantlement of the right of self-defense. Several giant retailers are assisting the attacks against our Natural right of self-defense. The mainstream media is incessant in its attacks against the Second Amendment. And even many of America’s churches have set themselves against the right to BEAR arms. The war against our Natural right of self-defense continues.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, I need to point out that the architects of the Nanny State have been trying to disarm the American people since even before the United Nations was created. And while the right to keep and bear arms has been severely restricted by myriads of federal, State, and local laws, the American people continue to be the most heavily armed people in the world. Not only is the American citizenry an armed citizenry, it is an absolutely determined citizenry. The message to any and all potential tyrants who would attempt to remove our Natural right of self-defense is the same&#8211;whether they are from King George’s London, Mao’s Beijing, Stalin’s Moscow, Emanuel’s Chicago, Obama’s Washington, D.C., or the U.N.’s New York City: MOLON LABE, COME AND TAKE THEM!</p>

<p><em>“The Doctrine and Covenants leaves no doubt about the Mormon teaching of exclusivity when it says the LDS Church is, ‘the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased….’&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Glenn Beck recently threw a hissy fit on his daily radio program over “religious people [who] claim to be followers of Christ” getting upset that he was the featured convocation speaker at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.libertyuniversity.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO_xECD3B3zPxZIsAxjvPPrtwREQ">Liberty University</a> (LU).  Beck accused those who were concerned over a cultist preaching a sermon of “absolutely smearing” LU.</p>
<p>Let’s cut to the chase.  Glenn Beck is a Mormon in good standing.  Mormonism is a theological cult.  Thus Beck’s not an authentic Christian &#8212; period.  That some Christians have the temerity to object to a cultist giving a sermon at a Christian university offended Mr. Beck, thus his rant.</p>
<p>In an earlier column I wrote <em>Questioning with boldness: Which is it Glenn, are you a Mormon or a Christian?</em> I provided an in depth examination of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mormon.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSfdiwjY03mHgCU6gpbQij8y32HQ">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.  So I’m not going to spend a lot of time re-examine it here.  However, to help you get a handle on what Mormons believe, the following is a snippet of Mormon Christianity from my column.  As you will see, what they believe isn’t even close to biblical Christianity:</p>
<p><em>LDS Christianity outright denies the Trinity which is an essential of biblical Christianity.  So LDS Christianity and orthodox Christianity do not believe in the same God.  Mormon Christianity teaches that there are many gods who are overseers of other planets.  The god of planet Earth, the one they call Elohim, was just a man with a body of flesh and bones who progressed to godhood and was rewarded with his own planet.  [Founder]Joseph Smith taught, &#8220;God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens. That is the great secret&#8230; [Y]ou have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods have done before you&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Brigham Young believed in a plurality of gods: &#8220;How many Gods there are, I do not know. But there never was a time when there were not Gods&#8230;&#8221; (</em><em>Journal of Discourses</em><em> 7:333).</em></p>
<p><em>Mormons believe that after death they will become gods and will be rewarded with their own planet.  Thereafter they will spend eternity with their many wives (polygamy) producing offspring to populate their planet.  Traditional Christianity says that God is not a man. (Numbers 23:19) Mormon Christianity teaches that man first existed as spirits in heaven.  Biblical Christianity says that the physical body comes before the spiritual. (1 Cor 15:46) </em></p>
<p><em>And LDS Christianity teaches this humdinger: Jesus and Lucifer are spirit children of God, which makes them spirit brothers. </em></p>
<p>Bible believing Christians will understand that historic orthodox Christianity does not hold to any of what Joseph Smith conjured up.  There is no way that Glenn Beck is unaware of Smith’s beliefs and background.  Later in my column I brought to light that,</p>
<p><em>…it was Joseph Smith and subsequent Mormon hierarchy that attacked Christianity.  The truth is Joseph Smith’s religion, which he made up out of whole cloth, is an abomination to God! </em></p>
<p><em>It seems weird to me that Glenn Beck spends oodles of time gathering dirt on leftist radicals and that he digs deep to get the skinny on President Obama but has neglected to do some deep digging on …  Joseph Smith.  His church’s so-called prophet was a charlatan, a polygamist, an adulterer, and he was up to his eyeballs in the occult as was his father.  There&#8217;s plenty of evidence on the web for inquiring minds that want to know the truth about Mormonism’s founder.  </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F100825&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzr5qEQKGyIX0VSWtE8Pu5TVw9GQ">Source</a>)</p>
<p>For reasons known only to him, Glenn Beck holds the LDS Church in high regard.  Consequently, he’s deluded.  Why do I say that?  To put it bluntly, Mormonism is a satanic cult.  (Those who wish to research the LDS are invited to visit my <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Femailbrigade.com%2F301.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEi125g9pqzEb3p4Yl3SZmmI99DEw">website</a>.)  LU knows this full well, yet Beck was invited to speak to its students.  As I mentioned above, Beck preached a sermon saturated with Mormon theology.  Moreover, he shared a valuable artifact &#8212; Joseph Smith’s pocket watch.</p>
<p><strong>Liberty University Enlightens Us</strong></p>
<p>Following is LU’s explanation, in part, for their decision:</p>
<p><em>We have explained over the decades repeatedly that convocation is an opportunity for students to hear from people of all faiths and from all walks of life.  Liberty has also made it clear repeatedly that it does not endorse any statements made by any convocation speaker.</em></p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p><em>By contrast, our faculty are all required to profess Liberty’s statement of faith and to affirm our doctrinal statement.  Our students are all required to take many credit hours of theology and Bible courses, regardless of their major.  Our students have no question about what Liberty’s doctrinal statement is.  It is posted publicly for all to see. Our doctrinal statement is our public statement on Mormonism.  It is the same statement that Liberty was founded upon and it will never change.</em></p>
<p><em>College is about learning.  How can you defend what you believe if you don’t understand what others believe? </em></p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p><em>I believe our students are stronger in their faith because of our convocation speaker series and the wide diversity of views that they have been privileged to hear in person over the last few decades.</em></p>
<p><em>By the way, many conservative evangelical leaders who are closer to Beck than me have told me that they believe Beck has had a born again experience recently.</em></p>
<p>Hold it right there!  The “Glenn Beck is saved” rumor has been circulating for several years thanks largely to Wall Builders Founder <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fapprising.org%2F2012%2F08%2F22%2Fdavid-barton-gave-them-revisionist-history-they-wanted%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEC1Df2rJ1avF5y10wkS5Kpt_JqIA">David Barton</a>, “American evangelicals’ favorite historian.”  If it’s true, then why is Beck keeping the good news from his friends and fans?  Moreover, if he truly is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gty.org%2Fresources%2Fsermons%2F43-13&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_c-GNIMaMa3Bqg0QcTULSU9XLDg">regenerate</a> then why hasn’t he cut all ties to the LDS Church and joined a church where the true gospel of Christ is preached?</p>
<p>LU’s explanation continues:</p>
<p><em>I do not know his heart but our audience knows that he was speaking only for himself and expressing his personal opinions and beliefs, not those of Liberty University or even of Mormonism generally. As Jerry Falwell, Sr., our founder, often used to say about speakers at Liberty who had different views than him, Liberty students are smart enough to eat the fish and spit out the bones! I believe that’s as true today as it was in his day.</em></p>
<p>Are we to assume every student is mature in their faith and has spiritual discernment?  Are we to assume that every student who attends a Christian university has been born again and thus saved? Did it not occur to Jerry Falwell, Jr. that some of the students who ate the fish Glenn Beck dished up could have choked on the bones?!</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. Liberty University has the right to invite whoever they wish to speak to its students.  But lately they seem to have an affinity for Mormons, as Glenn Beck has spoken at the university twice.  In 2010 he delivered the commencement address and received an honorary doctorate degree.  Likewise, Mormon Mitt Romney gave the commencement speech in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>A Martyr?</strong></p>
<p>Is it true that Joseph Smith died a martyr, as Glenn Beck declared to LU’s students?  Not so fast, Glenn!  The factual account of what led to Smith’s death reveal that he and his brother Hyrum were charged with treason and conspiracy by Illinois authorities whereby they were arrested and imprisoned in a minimum security cell in the Carthage city jail. According to <em>The Martyrdom of Joseph Smith </em>by Eric Johnson:</p>
<p><em>He and his brother Hyrum Smith were murdered on June 27, 1844, by an armed mob, an event that has prompted Mormons to classify them as martyrs. It has caused others, however, to raise the question whether someone who dies in a gun battle fighting against his enemies can be considered to be a martyr. A close examination of the term reveals that one must meet specific requirements to be considered a martyr, which involve, for example, the reasons why one is put to death and the way one faces such a death. An investigation of the reasons why Smith was murdered and the actions he took to avoid this fate inevitably makes it difficult to maintain that Smith was “like a lamb led to the slaughter.”</em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mrm.org%2Fmartyrdom&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFacZ_fvaA9QUBqgyowYppq_iyPpQ">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Johnson offers several reasons why he believes it is not accurate to classify Smith a martyr which you’ll find in his essay under the heading: THE FALLACY OF DEEMING SMITH A MARTYR.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glenn’s Rant</strong></p>
<p>To spare you from having to read Beck’s ridiculous rant, I’ll post a few quotes from a piece by Erica Ritz:</p>
<p><em>This is why your churches are dwindling. … You think you’re standing for something, when indeed, you’re standing for hate and bigotry. I think Jesus was hanging out with prostitutes and sinners, wasn’t he? You won’t even listen to a man who says … ‘I challenge you to know your faith, not my faith, </em><em>your</em><em> faith so well that you’re willing to die for it. Stand with one another.’ That frightens you so much? If it does, you might want to consider that you’re on the wrong side.</em></p>
<p>Let’s see.  “Prophet” Joseph Smith said that “Christianity had become apostate, and all of their creeds were corrupt, and all of their followers were deceived.” Therefore, it fell to Smith not to “reform” the Christian church, but to “restore” it.”</p>
<p>And anyone who rejects Mormon heresy is “standing for hate and bigotry.”</p>
<p>More…</p>
<p><em>I look at every single lover of light and truth as my ally, my friend, my brother. … I look at everyone who is my enemy as my brother. I don’t care what you say; I don’t care what you think your belief is; I don’t care what your lifestyle is — you’re not going to change me. And I invite you to join me, join others of multiple faiths — never asking anyone to change their faith — asking you to </em><em>strengthen</em><em> your faith, whatever it is. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblaze.com%2Fstories%2F2014%2F05%2F20%2Fa-land-of-monsters-beck-fires-back-at-those-attacking-liberty-university-for-inviting-him-to-speak%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqMaAOb0SI_UwfJkoCE_eFXgPb5A">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Beck is oblivious to the fact that his <em>truth</em> is NOT biblical Truth.  On the contrary, what he’s “preaching” to anyone who’s willing to listen, and to a captive audience at LU by the way, is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fecumenism-ecumenical.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjd9SyoGRC0RpVX7taAQHRQm8Ijw">ecumenism</a>.  This New Age Mormon who professes Christ vociferously urges his followers to join together with other religious faiths and sing <em>We Are the World.</em>  If Michael Jackson were alive today, he’d be proud of Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>Glenn claims he’s read the Bible several times.  Perhaps he has.  However, he must have skipped over Paul’s teaching in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMAY0VmYFOOkoqEQo2lwys2YH5dQ">2 Cor. 6:14-16</a>:</p>
<p><em>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial?<sup> </sup> Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?  What agreement has the temple of God with idols?  For we are the temple of the living God.</em></p>
<p>Unbelievers are in darkness.  For this reason believers are not to unite with them in any sort of spiritual enterprise.  And those who are in darkness, the unsaved, are <em>not</em> our brothers and sisters.  Thus, we are commanded to share the gospel of Christ with them.  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fniv%2F1_corinthians%2F15.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAjWjlZhf3kV7yh2vW2rV6bnnrTw">1 Cor. 15:1-11</a>)</p>
<p><strong>One last quote from Glenn Beck’s hero, Joseph Smith where we learn a bit more of his bizarre and unbiblical understanding of God, which, by his own admission is the view of God Glenn holds as he is, after all, a professing Mormon:</strong></p>
<p><em>I say, if you were to see him [God] to-day, you would see him like a man in form&#8211;like yourselves, in all the person, image, and very form as a man . . . it is necessary that we should understand the character and being of God, and how he came to be so; for I am going to tell you how God came to be God. We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity,  I will refute that idea, and will take away and do away the veil, so that you may see . . . and that he was once a man like us; yea, that God himself the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth the same as Jesus Christ himself did.</em>  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fjoseph-smith-quotes&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYwtf-ftbue75cq3M-_9rjNcWwGw">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Now a bit of wise counsel from Erin Benziger in <em>What If ‘My God’ Is Bigger than ‘Your God’?</em> :</p>
<p><em>It is sinful pride that leads men into idolatry as they create imaginary gods that suit their own personal needs. It is the same sinful pride that prevents men from bowing low before the True God. It is this pride that refuses to acknowledge one&#8217;s own inability to offer anything truly &#8220;good&#8221; and refuses to acknowledge his own sinfulness. Yet it is God Who can, by wonderful, amazing grace, break a man of this pride and bring him to his knees in humility. It is God Who can bring the most stubborn, prideful man to a place of repentance and faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ. May we pray this day and every day that God would use us to proclaim the truth of His Gospel to such men, and may we pray that His Spirit would stir and work within those men to bring them to repentant, saving faith and knowledge of His Son. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.donotbesurprised.com%2F2014%2F05%2Fwhat-if-my-god-is-bigger-than-your-god.html%23more&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOiM7dgApsDmJ9tYERcUPA3ZhZFw">Source</a>)</p>

			<p>It is easy to stand up and cheer for your favorite government activity. It is quite another to acknowledge what it means in the real world.</p>
<p>I almost never try to speak for other people. However, I think it is fairly safe to say that the average military recruit firmly believes that he joins the military so that you and I can live and breathe in freedom. To be sure, he had other reasons for joining, but I think the defense of liberty is a fairly common characteristic.</p>
<p>That is certainly what I thought when I was in Navy boot camp in Orlando, Florida, in 1983. After all, this is what I had been told all my life: sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines defend freedom.</p>
<p>But is this actually what they do?</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Marine lost both legs in an IED blast in Iraq. He claims he was forced by TSA to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/mar/19/tsa-agents-humiliated-wounded-marine-aggressive-in/" target="_blank">remove both prosthetic legs</a> before he could board an airplane in Phoenix.</li>
<li>This Vietnam veteran in Spicewood, Texas, had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/08/raids-of-the-day-the-capi_n_2644894.html" target="_blank">flashbacks to his combat experience during a marijuana raid</a> at a friend’s house. What police claimed was marijuana turned out to be ragweed.<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg?w=300&amp;h=152" alt="jared goering" width="300" height="152" /></a></li>
<li>Jared Goering, who served 19 years in the Army, including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was <a href="http://www.lifewithdogs.tv/2013/08/veteran-kicked-off-boardwalk-for-having-a-service-dog/" target="_blank">kicked off the boardwalk in Wildwood, N.J.</a> for walking with his service dog, Gator.</li>
<li>Emily Yates, who served two tours with the Army in Iraq, was <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=3bf_1378009165" target="_blank">violently arrested by park police in Philadelphia</a> for asking why she couldn’t play her banjo under some shade trees.</li>
<li>Dimitrios Karras is a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan. Read about the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/ares-armor-operating-store-camera-caught-first-moments-of-saturday-raid" target="_blank">ATF raid on his business</a> in National City, California.</li>
<li>Martin Goldberg of Brooklyn is a World War II veteran <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/raid-of-t_n_3102929.html" target="_blank">whose apartment was subject to a drug raid</a>. Later, the cops realized they had raided the wrong apartment. His 83-year-old wife was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat as a result of the raid.<br />

<li>In 1997, four sailors from the USS Saipan (LHA-2) were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19Norfolk-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">falsely accused</a> of the rape and murder of a Norfolk, Virginia, woman. One spent eight-and-one-half years in prison while the other three were sentenced to life in prison. These three were pardoned in 2009. Even though the actual killer is serving a life sentence, four innocent men are still required to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Four" target="_blank">register as sex offenders</a> and are still <a href="http://www.norfolkfour.com/" target="_blank">fighting to clear their names</a>.</li>

<li>Kenneth Chamberlain was a retired Marine and Vietnam veteran living in White Plains, New York. Early one morning he set off his medical alert device.

<li>Radio talk host Adam Kokesh won the Navy Commendation Medal as a Marine in Iraq. In recent years, he has been <a href="http://libertycrier.com/avtm-4-0-crowdfunder-campaign/?utm_source=The+Liberty+Crier&amp;utm_campaign=00062d8203-The_Liberty_Crier_Daily_News_2_5_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_600843dec4-00062d8203-284780633" target="_blank">arrested several times for various non-violent protests</a>. His most recent arrest happened after he loaded a shotgun in public in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 2013. On July 10, police <a href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/2013/07/12/thoughts-on-the-police-raid-on-adam-kokesh-and-on-his-canceled-march/" target="_blank">violently raided his home and arrested him</a>.

He is currently on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh" target="_blank">probation for two years</a>. You may not like Kokesh’s demeanor or approve of all of his antics, but he has been very courageous when so many of his critics can’t be bothered to put down the remote.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg?w=640" alt="james moore" /></a></li>
<li>James Moore, my brothah from anothah mothah, walked away from a very lucrative engineering position in San Jose to re-enlist in the Army following 9/11. He sustained significant physical injuries as well as PTSD while serving in the Special Forces in Afghanistan. On the afternoon of March 25, 2008, Moore, who had done absolutely nothing wrong, was <a href="http://www.freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/necessary-force.html">beaten to the point of flat lining by Denver police.</a></li>
<li>One of the coolest people I have never met is Antonio Buehler. Buehler graduated from West Point in 1999, earned his Ranger tab, and saw action in Kosovo and Iraq. (He also sports a Stanford MBA.) Early in the morning on January 1, 2012, Buehler <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVZDpGCKks" target="_blank">was arrested</a> for taking a few pictures of Austin police manhandling a young woman outside a 7-11. Buehler has been arrested four times since. He heads the <a href="http://peacefulstreets.com/" target="_blank">Peaceful Streets Project</a>, whose members work to expose abuse, brutality and overreach both in Austin and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FreeAntonioBuehler/" target="_blank">across the nation</a>.<br />

</ul>
<p>There are no doubt numerous other injustices against veterans that I do not know about. Enough to fill a book. None of these things would have happened if America were a free society. As Kokesh puts it, “The greatest enemies to the Constitution are not to be found in the sands of some far off land but rather right here at home.”</p>
<p>I cannot speak to the specific political beliefs of most of the veterans I have mentioned here. Some may be pacifists, while others may make John McCain look like a hippie in Haight-Ashbury. No matter what their individual views may be, the freedom they risked their lives for was flagrantly violated on the streets of the land they fought to protect.</p>

<p>Society endlessly applauds sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines for “fighting for our freedom”. It is in no way disrespectful to say that this is not what they do. No foreign government or terrorist group poses any threat to our liberty. America accounts for about half of the world’s military spending. We have 300 ships in our Navy, plus thousands of planes, tanks and nuclear warheads as well as 300 million firearms in private hands. Nobody is going to invade us.</p>
<p>In a constitutional country, which America ceased to be 100 years ago, the job of the military – a vital and most noble one – is to defend the borders, shores and airspace. It cannot protect you from being tyrannized domestically. Indeed, throughout history, armies have been instruments of domestic tyranny. Our Constitution forbids a standing army for just this reason.</p>

<p>Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia had enormous military establishments. How did things work out in these countries?</p>
<p>I am a Christian who believes liberty is a gift from God – Leviticus 25:10; II Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:1. To quote Jefferson, liberty is preserved not by military might, but by “eternal vigilance” against one’s own government at all levels. It is the grossest form of disrespect to send young men around the world to “fight for freedom” while relinquishing that freedom on the home front.</p>

<p>On April 20, 2013, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/20/but-they-got-the-suspect-thats-not-the-point/" target="_blank">Boston and several surrounding towns</a> got a <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/25/lockdowns-do-not-keep-you-safe-letter-to-the-denver-post/" target="_blank">serious taste</a> of <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/23/sometimes-martial-law-is-necessary/" target="_blank">martial law</a>. How many military veterans were on the receiving end of this? Is this what they signed up to fight for?</p>
<p>Stop thinking in clichés. Have a good hard look at everything your media and government tell you. This includes media outlets and parts of the government that you like. Study. Read. Ask questions. And learn that the defense of liberty is not the duty of the military. Rather, it is your duty and mine.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">According to The Salt Lake Tribune, “It’s time for Western states to take control of federal lands within their borders, lawmakers and county commissioners from Western states said at Utah’s Capitol on Friday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“More than 50 political leaders from nine states convened for the first time to talk about their joint goal: wresting control of oil-,timber-and mineral-rich lands away from the feds.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘It’s simply time,’ said Rep. Ken Ivory, R-West Jordan, who organized the Legislative Summit on the Transfer for Public Lands along with Montana state Sen. Jennifer Fielder. ‘The urgency is now.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Utah House Speaker Becky Lockhart, R-Provo, was flanked by a dozen participants, including her counterparts from Idaho and Montana, during a press conference after the daylong closed-door summit. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee addressed the group over lunch, Ivory said. New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington also were represented.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The summit was in the works before this month’s tense standoff between Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management over cattle grazing, Lockhart said.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘What’s happened in Nevada is really just a symptom of a much larger problem,’ Lockhart said.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sltrib.com%2Fsltrib%2Fpolitics%2F57836973-90%2Futah-lands-lawmakers-federal.html.csp&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpCMp3rdO1K_3HsZXKqIvIH22tpw" target="_blank">Western Lawmakers Gather In Utah To Talk Federal Land Takeover</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now we are getting somewhere!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The western states have been used as both playground and sugar stick for big-government politicians since before most of the western states became states. Compare the percentage of State land owned by the federal government in the western states to that of the eastern states.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here is the percentage of land owned by the federal government in seven eastern states:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Illinois: 1.8%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ohio: 1.7%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Alabama: 1.6%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Maine: 1.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">New York: 0.8%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Rhode Island: 0.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Connecticut: 0.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By contrast, here is the percentage of land owned by the federal government in seven western states:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Wyoming: 42.3%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">California: 45.3%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Arizona: 48.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Idaho: 50.2%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Oregon: 53.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Utah: 57.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Nevada: 84.5%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The situation with the Bundys in Nevada highlights the heavy-handed tactics that the federal government employs against anyone who dares to challenge the manner in which the feds are attempting to kick hard-working, productive citizens off of federal lands. Remember that ranchers and farmers such as Cliven Bundy were promised access to these federal lands in perpetuity back in the nineteenth century when all of these land deals were being negotiated between the states and the federal government. Beyond that, ownership of the land by the federal government was supposed to preserve and protect the land for the people, not for the federal government.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A few years ago, there were dozens of successful and prosperous ranchers in the area around the Bundys. But since the BLM was given legislative mandates when Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) in 1976, Cliven Bundy is now the only rancher in the area still standing.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The BLM has grown into a totalitarian monster.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, the BLM regulates hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, boating, hang gliding, shooting, off-highway vehicle driving, mountain biking, bird watching, and visiting natural and historical sites. The BLM also regulates logging, mining, fracking and other activities. What ranchers such as Cliven Bundy are going through loggers and miners are also experiencing. In fact, it is no hyperbole to say that, for all intents and purposes, the ranching, logging, and mining industries in the western states are being systematically regulated out of existence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And in the case of Cliven Bundy, it is not about saving the Desert Tortoise or grazing fees or anything of the sort. It is all about letting fat-cat politicians such as Harry Reid negotiate lucrative solar energy deals with Communist China. Hey, folks: if the land doesn’t belong to Cliven Bundy, it doesn’t belong to Harry Reid, either!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The BLM’s evil twin sister is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was established in 1970. These two federal agencies have become the Wicked Witch of the East and Wicked Witch of the West in what used to be a beautiful land paved with yellow brick roads.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">I dare say that if the eastern states were enduring the haranguing and harassment that the western states are enduring, the BLM would have been brought under control years ago. Absent national unity from eastern states on the matter, it is time for the western states to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The legislative action being contemplated by the above-mentioned State legislators who assembled in Salt Lake City last Friday is a terrific first step. It is absolutely time for the western states to use their eminent domain authority to reclaim the lands within their borders that are currently owned by Washington, D.C. With the exception of National Parks, states should serve notice that they are taking back the land owned by the federal government&#8211;land that should never have been ceded to the central government to begin with.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The second problem that the siege against Cliven Bundy illustrates is the unconstitutional police powers assumed by federal agencies such as the BLM. Originally, the only federal agency that was lawfully allowed to make arrests on behalf of the U.S. government was the U.S. Marshals Service, which was created back in 1789&#8211;the year that the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Today, there are scores of alphabet agencies of the federal government who carry a badge and a gun and are allowed to enforce law at bayonet point. And the vast majority of these agencies are acting on assumed authority&#8211;authority not granted them constitutionally. Among these, there is no greater culprit than the BLM.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“You don’t send the Seventh Cavalry to collect a bill, and that’s exactly what happened,” Pat Buchanan told Sean Hannity on his radio show last Monday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Buchanan went on to say, “And when they put all those forces out there-that’s what attracted all the others, the history of what happened at Waco, Ruby Ridge. And so these folks came to that rancher’s defense. But the initial problem here is [the] sending of all the force of arms out there to that ranch, which was a provocation to which these folks responded.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtontimes.com%2Fnews%2F2014%2Fapr%2F22%2Fpat-buchanan-sums-nevada-sending-seventh-cavalry-c%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzyHxXC-lxsYy8ZqPoCg0lqT3OGg" target="_blank">Pat Buchanan Sums Up Nevada Ranch Standoff: Sending ‘Seventh Cavalry To Collect A Bill’</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Constitution delegates only three crimes to the federal government: treason, piracy, and counterfeiting. That’s it. No other crimes are mentioned. That means that all other crimes are the purview of the states&#8211;including local and State police, sheriff’s deputies, and citizen militias and posses.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, the problem is the Congress (and Court) in Washington, D.C., has used the “Necessary and Proper Clause” of Article. I. Section. 8. to justify all sorts of federal law enforcement enactments.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The result of this unconstitutional federal expansion of police powers is we now have scores of federal agencies that are using unchecked and unbridled power&#8211;power that is turning the United States into a giant police state.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The states must push back!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Not only must states reclaim millions of acres of land within their borders that are now controlled by the federal government, they must also pass legislation requiring federal bureaucracies such as the BLM to obtain the consent of county sheriffs in order to execute arrest warrants. States must make it clear in unmistakable terms that only the U.S. Marshals Service may execute federal warrants within their states; otherwise, only the county sheriff is authorized to execute arrest warrants within their states.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the U.S. Congress needs to disarm the countless federal bureaucracies that are currently terrorizing the American people. In truth, very few federal agencies need to carry guns. The politicians in Washington, D.C., love to try to disarm the American people, but the ones they should be disarming are most of the federal alphabet agencies.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Why do employees of the federal Department of Education need to carry guns? Why do postal employees need to carry guns? Why do agents of the BLM need to carry guns? Why do employees at NASA need to carry guns? Why do employees of the EPA need to carry guns? Why do employees at NOAA need to carry guns? Why do employees of the National Weather Service need to carry guns? Why do employees of the Social Security Administration need to carry guns? Why do employees at the Department of Agriculture need to carry guns? Why do employees of the National Marine Fisheries Service need to carry guns?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ladies and gentlemen, law enforcement is mostly the responsibility of State and local governments. Why are so many federal bureaucracies carrying guns? Agencies of the federal government are not soldiers; and they are not even policemen. Furthermore, the American people are not the enemy!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Pat Buchanan is right: had not BLM agents marched onto the Bundy ranch like Nazi Stormtroopers, none of the events that are still playing out in the Nevada desert would have taken place. The memory of Waco and Ruby Ridge are still very vivid in the collective memory of the people of the United States. If anything burns deep in our collective conscience, it is that THERE MUST NEVER AGAIN BE ANOTHER WACO OR RUBY RIDGE. And that is exactly why those Americans have put themselves between the federal government and the Bundy family down in Bunkerville, Nevada.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The events in Salt Lake City, Utah, conducted by dozens of legislators from the western states last Friday were as monumental as the events in Bunkerville, Nevada, conducted by the citizen militia the previous Saturday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Free and independent states and “We the People” have always been the guardians of liberty in this land. And if freedom is going to be preserved for our posterity, it is going to take the combined effort of both the individual sovereign states and individual citizens to arise and stand in the gap once again. It would also seem that the rise has already begun. Praise God! The only thing missing now is the patriot pulpit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">P.S. I have been inundated with requests from pastors and laymen alike to help them establish non-501c3, unaffiliated, unorganized, unincorporated churches. I have heard their pleas; and I have a very important announcement regarding this matter coming in the very near future. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Reuters News reported that a nationwide poll conducted of the Russian people found that former dictator Josef Stalin was voted the third most popular historical figure. Over one-third of the Russian population participated in the poll.</p>
<p>See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2F2008%2F12%2F28%2Fus-russia-stalin-idUSTRE4BR17620081228%3FfeedType%3DRSS%26feedName%3DtopNews&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeQ36qPcP7bSYa2fYgEEDSqWWCsg" target="_blank">Dictator Stalin Voted Third Most Popular Russian</a></p>
<p>Can you imagine? Stalin just might be the greatest mass-murderer in human history. Estimates of the body count during Stalin’s reign of terror range anywhere from 20-60 million, and that doesn’t include the millions of people who were starved, imprisoned, and tortured but who didn’t die. Only China’s Mao Tse-tung rivals Stalin’s butchery. Then, again, many Chinese people still love Mao Tse-tung, too.</p>
<p>How is it that people can laud and honor tyrants and butchers? How can people so easily submit to slavery and despotism?</p>
<p>No tyrant rises to power calling himself a tyrant. Tyranny is never sold as tyranny. Every tyrannical regime of history considered itself to be patriotic and compassionate; and the people who supported and submitted to such regimes considered themselves to be patriotic and compassionate, as well. The police state is never called that by those who promote it; they call it “law and order,” “keeping the peace,” “protecting the homeland,” etc.</p>
<p>Ask the average American today about the possibility that our country could become a police state and the common response is, “That could never happen here.” But, ladies and gentlemen, it is already happening here. And, furthermore, it seems that the vast majority of the American people are all in favor it. Republicans love it; Democrats love it; Christians love it; politicians love it; police officers love it; pastors love it; school teachers love it; businessmen love it; everyone loves a police state.</p>
<p>Threaten to remove Phil Robertson from Duck Dynasty, and Christians and conservatives come out of the woodwork in righteous indignation. Threaten to put a Nativity scene on some courthouse lawn, and Democrats and liberals come out of the woodwork in righteous indignation. But propose laws that strip the American people of their God-ordained liberties protected by the Bill of Rights, and conservatives and liberals alike, Christians and unbelievers alike, think it’s just about the greatest thing since sliced bread.</p>
<p>You don’t believe that? Try this news story on for size:</p>
<p>According to a World Net Daily report, “The 2014 NDAA was fast-tracked through the U.S. Senate, with no time for discussion or amendments, while most Americans were distracted by the scandal surrounding A&amp;E’s troubles with ‘Duck Dynasty’ star Phil Robertson.</p>
<p>“Eighty-five of 100 senators voted in favor of the new version of the NDAA, which had already been quietly passed by the House of Representatives.”</p>
<p>The report continued saying, “Section 1021 allows the detention of anyone, including American citizens, by the military, if the president considers that person to have helped with terror.”</p>
<p>The report further said, “Congress specifically expressed its desire for the detention provision to apply to American citizens even on American soil by rejecting multiple amendments that would have exempted them.”</p>
<p>So, where are the notable leaders of the Religious Right? Where are the liberal groups? Where is the national media? Where are the talking heads from the right and the left? With precious few exceptions, they are absolutely silent on the subject. Why? Because they like it.</p>
<p>Liberals never met a big-government program or proposal they didn’t like. If it increases the size and scope of government, liberals love it. Conservatives love anything that smacks of “law and order.” (A word of caution: you never want to be the defendant in a courtroom where the jury is stacked with conservatives. If you do, you’re dead meat, friend.) And Christians get goose bumps up their spine about anything they think resembles Romans 13. Give government more power over our lives and listen to the Hallelujahs ringing out from the all of these 501c3 churches. And ditto for most of the talking heads on radio and television and the vast majority of the pundits and spokesmen from the national news media. Like I said, everyone loves a police state.</p>
<p>Well, not everyone, thank God!</p>
<p>The same WND report mentioned above states, “Some of the nation’s most respected legal teams are asking the Supreme Court to take up a challenge to the indefinite-detention provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act, charging the law has created the framework for a police state.</p>
<p>“The controversial provision authorizes the military, under presidential authority, to arrest, kidnap, detain without trial and hold indefinitely American citizens thought to ‘represent an enduring security threat to the United States.’</p>
<p>“Journalist Chris Hedges is among the plaintiffs charging the law could be used to target journalists who report on terror-related issues.</p>
<p>A friend-of-the-court brief submitted in the case states: ‘The central question now before this court is whether the federal judiciary will stand idly by while Congress and the president establish the legal framework for the establishment of a police state and the subjugation of the American citizenry through the threat of indefinite military arrest and detention, without the right to counsel, the right to confront one’s accusers, or the right to trial.’</p>
<p>“The brief was submitted to the Supreme Court by attorneys with the U.S. Justice Foundation of Ramona, Calif., Friedman Harfenist Kraut &amp; Perlstein of Lake Success, N.Y., and William J. Olson, P.C. of Vienna, Va.”</p>
<p>See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnd.com%2F2014%2F01%2Fcongress-grants-obama-free-rein-for-martial-law%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqbr4ed2OUneJJxS1ByeSHbFnwHg" target="_blank">Congress Grants Obama Free Rein For Martial Law</a></p>
<p>Believe it or not, there was a time in this country when people from both sides of the political aisle believed in freedom. I know it’s hard to imagine, but there was a time in this country when pastors from virtually every denomination believed in freedom. Not only did they believe in it; they fought for it. It seems like a long time ago.</p>
<p>Have you taken a close look at your State and local police agencies lately? More and more, our police officers and sheriff’s deputies resemble soldiers more than they do peace officers. I challenge you to Google “police abuse.” What you will discover will shock you. And, for all intents and purposes, the folks who live in many Northeastern states&#8212;along with California and Illinois&#8211;are already living in a State that is more controlled than many foreign countries, including some of the countries that we would call oppressive. And even our freer states are feeling the heavy hand of Big Brother more and more each day.</p>
<p>In fact, if you want to really get a taste of a police state, just move into some neighborhoods with their Gestapo-like Home Owner Associations (HOA). I’m telling you, some of these HOA rival anything Adolf Hitler could dream up.</p>
<p>Folks, take a good, hard look at reality: America is already in the beginning throes of a police state. Orwell’s “1984” and Huxley’s “Brave New World” are here. And far, far too many people seem fine with it.</p>
<p>I tell you the truth: I am to the point where I don’t know what to call myself. “Conservative” means nothing today. Nothing! One can be a “conservative” and believe in Big Government, undeclared wars of intervention, debt-driven economics, socialized medicine, increased taxes, and, of course, a police state. Likewise, “Christian” means nothing today. Nothing! One can be a “Christian” and believe in Big Government, undeclared wars of intervention, debt-driven economics, socialized medicine, increased taxes, and, of course, a police state. Oh, many “conservatives” and “Christians” might SAY they don’t believe in these things, but their actions (or lack of them) speak louder than their words.</p>
<p>A big THANK YOU is in order for Bill Olson, Herb Titus, Chris Hedges, et al. And THANK YOU to all of you folks out there who see what’s going on and are actively engaged in “the holy cause of liberty.” (Patrick Henry) I am your brother and compatriot, no matter what you call yourself. At this point, we aren’t conservatives or liberals, Christians or unbelievers; we are freedomists or statists.</p>
<p>Tyrants such as Joe Stalin and Mao Tse-tung might be popular with some people, and a burgeoning police state might be popular with some people, but there is a whole host of us in these United States who aren’t going to the gulags and gas chambers peacefully. And unlike the peasants of Europe and Asia, we aren’t surrendering our means of self-defense, either.</p>
<p>No, not everyone loves a police state.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fveracityvoice.com%2F%3Fp%3D19066&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe7zlJHQ0q3CMT49ArPbppABVKvQ" target="_blank">I wrote previously</a> about our cultural fantasy that forgets we are totally dependent on soil and water.  At the end of his Commentary on the Book of Numbers R. J. Rushdoony writes as follows: “For modern man land has become a commodity and an investment, not essentially a faith inheritance.  Our modern outlook thus warps our perspective.  For this reason, our federal government thinks nothing of allowing in as immigrants an increasing number of people who are religiously and racially hostile to us.  They see no relationship between faith and land.  As a result the United States and the Western world have embarked on a suicidal course.  They reject the concept of Christendom and embrace instead the humanistic “family of man” and thus immigration policies in the U.S. and Europe are based on myths and illusions of a destructive nature.  Because neither land nor inheritance is now seen from the perspective of faith, we have problems in these spheres.  The modern state sees itself as the primary owner, and hence eminent domain is basic to its life, and it therefore views itself as the primary heir with death taxes.  Both a tax on the land and death taxes are anti-Biblical.”</p>
<p>I am not sure that linking our immigration problem to a lack of understanding of the relationship between land and faith is entirely true.  Immigration in America is Balkanizing the nation and destroying the culture.  It is satanic in nature and is being promoted by powerful forces that seek world government without national borders. The Christian religion itself is a target for destruction.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, human beings are land based creatures and Christianity is a land based religion. We are but sojourners in a world that God created.  We are vested with the responsibility of passing God’s land to the next generation in an untainted condition.</p>
<p>When we hear of conversations in elite circles about the need to exterminate millions of useless eaters because the world is overpopulated we can, in part, attribute this arrogant discussion to our inattention to our earthly umbilical cord.</p>
<p>This separation from terra firma has been enhanced by modern farm machinery which allows planting and reaping with very little contact with the media.  Farmers with soil on their clothing and on their persons were ever aware of the element that grew their crops. Now air conditioned tractors provide comforts on a par with the offices of business executives.</p>
<p>Please understand, I am not advocating a return to the horse and buggy.  Mechanical inventions are a boon to mankind and we are blest to have them.  The problem is with the egomania these marvelous inventions have created, making gods of men and enhancing the humanism that is responsible for creeping despotism.</p>
<p>Without the absolute legal standards of the God of the Bible human beings with their diverse opinions and desires are incapable of peaceful existence.  We are more like devils than gods and when we give in to the sinful desire to be like God we inevitably create confusion and misery.  We were made to be obedient to our Maker and are unable to live in freedom without adhering to His commandments.</p>
<p>The terrifying dangers of men beginning to act as gods are becoming apparent in our manipulation of our soil and seeds.  We started by ignoring God’s Sabbath for the land.  The practice of allowing land to lie fallow for one year in every seven was abandoned and fertilizers and chemicals were added to allow the production of continuous annual crops.  Now we are manipulating seeds creating mutations that are designed to produce beneficial protections.  We have appropriated the right to manipulate the creation as if it belonged to us.  The results of this arbitrary manipulation can be catastrophic.</p>
<p>Social sophisticates often view farmers with disdain.  Farming is considered an occupation of dull, dirt tainted, bumpkins that do not fit into the upper classes of our culture. This Pharisaical spirit elevates urban life and bears responsibility for the detrimental error of forgetting the source of our sustenance.</p>
<p>My mother was born and raised on a farm.  She walking four miles each way to attend a school that housed 8 grades. She graduated from University of Illinois in the early years of the Twentieth Century and her sister, who was educated in that same humble classroom, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate from Northwestern University.  There were two boys in that Irish led family.  The boys remained with the land but the two girls married professional men.  The two boys were my uncles.  One died early without progeny the other had one son who with a college degree in Agriculture remained in farming.  He produced a girl and a boy.  The son remained on the farm and produced a son who has no interest in agriculture.  All of the land my Grandfather homesteaded will soon be leased out.</p>
<p>Mother’s family was Methodist.  She dominated my father.  Methodism stressed human control of behavior rather than obedience to God and His Law.  Land was a commodity rather than an intricate part of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>Government has been busy acquiring land in the United States.  Estimates place the total U. S. land at about 2.25 billion acres and the total federal and states ownership at close to 45 percent; The Federal Government owns about 700 million acres and rising.  In thirteen Western states two thirds of the entire land mass is Government property; 87.5 percent of the State of Arizona and over 90 percent of the State of Nevada.  The United States Government owns a larger percentage of the nation’s land than do the Communist regimes in Russia and China.</p>
<p>A Google search on “city is more competitive” produced over a hundred thousand results.  The elite pagans who currently control our world would like to herd people into cities where an intercity economic competition would keep everyone striving.   More and more of the land is falling under government control and hundreds of thousands of homes have been repossessed.  The intent seems to be for wealthy lords to live handsomely on the labor of the world’s serfs who would exist in tiny cubicles in crowded cities.</p>
<p>In ancient Israel God allowed the permanent sales of urban properties but had rural lands returned to their original owners in the year of Jubilee.  Stability was vested in the families that owned and cultivated land.  Though the processing, packaging, and merchandising of food has blurred the connection it is still the same today; the cultivation of land remains the source of sustenance for the world’s population..</p>
<p>In one of his daily messages in “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchalcedon.edu%2Fstore%2FCulture%2Fa-word-in-season-set%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFkYL8pAKwgb1goHQ8irz_dgsSb0Q" target="_blank">A Word in Season</a>” Rushdoony relates the early American practice of Rogation Sunday.  In the evening following Sunday prayer for the harvest “each farmer and his family walked the boundaries of their property and gave thanks for the good earth.  As they walked, the boy of the family was ‘bumped’ against the landmarks, the boundary stone, or against a boundary tree.  If a pond or stream marked the boundary he was ducked into it.  Then the boy who was bumped or ducked was given a small gift.  The purpose of the ‘bumping’ and of the gift was to make the boy remember the boundaries of the land he would someday fall heir to.”</p>
<p>We are prone to forget that the One True God is still sovereign over His creation.  His perspective is infinite and ours is miniscule it is often difficult to see His participation. Nevertheless, He does not change and He still punishes those who presume on His authority.  Human control of His creation will ultimately fail and the ravages of Hell await the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Wicked, ungodly men and women have risen to positions of power in our time.  These “sons of<br />
Belial” are attempting to turn God’s creation into a vicious police state; a hell on earth designed by evil minds to accommodate deviant lusts.</p>
<p>Extensive, mysterious efforts to control the weather are being conducted in our skies.  Though they are visible to everyone, thousands of weather forecasters never acknowledge their existence.  Our citizens, too, are frightened and often reluctant to comment on these brazen experiments. It is frightening to see such a massive manipulation play out above us. The beautiful deep blue of space and the billowy, floating clouds that have treated our views for millenniums have been replaced by man-made lines haphazardly drawn over God’s creation.</p>
<p>God’s Word is full of promises of favorable weather in return for diligent obedience and men who attempt to control what God has claimed as His own are at war with God.</p>
<p>Though we common folk appear to be the victims of the new world order’s Procrustean bed we too are culpable. We have failed to abide by God’s law concerning His creation. Farmers willingly till their soil without giving it rest.  Local authorities levy taxes against farm land interfering with the ownership and stability God intends.  We have broken God’s Law and have elected rulers that do so as well. Captivity is God’s punishment for intractable sin and the solution is to return to a proper relationship with our Creator.  Repentance involves understanding that we are servants and He is our Master and our King.  It is our duty to worship and obey Him.  Attempts to manipulate God will fail.  The Bible is not an instrument for discussion but for obedience.  We are appointed to judge the world by the yardstick of God’s Law.  First we ourselves obey then seek to bring our nation into obedience.</p>
<p>It is foolhardy to pray for a nation of sinners who disregard God’s sovereignty and ignore His commandments.   God is bringing captivity on the world because His people made in His image, sin against Him by living their lives independent of His Will.  The world falls deeper into sin as each day passes. Instead of hearing and obeying every word that comes from the mouth of God, we insult Him by picking apart His Word and deciding what we will believe and what we will ignore.  We treat the Christian religion like a toy that is fun for a season but that we can put aside whenever we wish.</p>

<p>There’s nothing like a glass of cool, clear water to quench one’s thirst. But the next time you or your child reaches for one, you might want to question whether that water is in fact, too toxic to drink. If your water is fluoridated, the answer may well be yes.</p>
<p>For decades, we have been told a lie, a lie that has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans and the weakening of the immune systems of tens of millions more. This lie is called fluoridation. A process we were led to believe was a safe and effective method of protecting teeth from decay is in fact a fraud. For decades it’s been shown that fluoridation is neither essential for good health nor protective of teeth. What it does is poison the body. We should all at this point be asking how and why public health policy and the American media continue to live with and perpetuate this scientific sham.</p>
<p><strong>The Latest in Fluoride News</strong></p>
<p>Today more than ever, evidence of fluoride’s toxicity is entering the public sphere.The summer of 2012 saw the publication of a systematic review and meta-analysis by researchers at Harvard University that explored the link between exposure to fluoride and neurological and cognitive function among children. The report pooled data from over 27 studies- many of them from China- carried out over the course of 22 years. The results, which were published in the journal Environmental Health Sciencesshowed a strong connection between exposure to fluoride in drinking water and decreased IQ scores in children. The team concluded that “the results suggest that fluoride may be a developmental neurotoxicant that affects brain development at exposures much below those that can cause toxicity in adults.&#8221; <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The newest scientific data suggest that the damaging effects of fluoride extend to reproductive health as well. A 2013 study published in the journal Archives of Toxicology showed a link between fluoride exposure and male infertility in mice. The study’s findings suggest that sodium fluoride impairs the ability of sperm cells in mice to normally fertilize the egg through a process known as chemotaxis.<sup> </sup><sup>2</sup> This is the latest in more than 60 scientific studies on animals that have identified an association between male infertility and fluoride exposure.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Adding more fuel to the fluoride controversy is a recent investigative report by NaturalNews exposing how the chemicals used to fluoridate United States’ water systems today are commonly purchased from Chinese chemical plants looking to discard surplus stores of this form of industrial waste. Disturbingly, the report details that some Chinese vendors of fluoride advertise on their website that their product can be used as an “adhesive preservative”, an “insecticide” as well as a” flux for soldering and welding”.<sup>4</sup><sup> </sup>One Chinese manufacturer, Shanghai Polymet Commodities Ltd,. which produces fluoride destined for municipal water reserves in the United States, notes on their website that their fluoride is “highly corrosive to human skin and harmful to people&#8217;s respiratory organs”.<sup> </sup><sup>5</sup></p>
<p><strong>The Fluoride Phase Out at Home and Abroad</strong></p>
<p>There are many signs in recent years that indicate growing skepticism over fluoridation. The New York Times reported in October 2011 that in the previous four years, about 200 jurisdictions across the USA moved to cease water fluoridation. A panel composed of scientists and health professionals in Fairbanks, Alaska recently recommended ceasing fluoridation of the county water supply after concluding that the addition of fluoride to already naturally-fluoridated reserves could pose health risks to 700,000 residents. The move to end fluoridation would save the county an estimated $205,000 annually.<sup> </sup><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The city of Portland made headlines in 2013 when it voted down a measure to fluoridate its water supply. The citizens of Portland have rejected introducing the chemical to drinking water on three separate occasions since the 1950’s. Portland remains the largest city in the United States to shun fluoridation.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>The movement against fluoridation has gained traction overseas as well. In 2013, Israel’s Ministry of Health committed to a countrywide phase-out of fluoridation. The decision came after Israel’s Supreme Court deemed the existing health regulations requiring fluoridation to be based on science that is “outdated” and “no longer widely accepted.”<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Also this year, the government of the Australian state of Queensland eliminated $14 million in funding for its state-wide fluoridation campaign. The decision, which was executed by the Liberal National Party (LNP) government, forced local councils to vote on whether or not to introduce fluoride to their water supplies. Less than two months after the decision came down, several communities including the town of Cairns halted fluoridation. As a result, nearly 200,000 Australians will no longer be exposed to fluoride in their drinking water.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>An ever-growing number of institutions and individuals are questioning the wisdom of fluoridation. At the fore of the movement are thousands of scientific authorities and health care professionals who are speaking out about the hazards of this damaging additive. As of November 2013, a group of over 4549 professionals including 361 dentists and 562 medical doctors have added their names to a petition aimed at ending fluoridation started by the Fluoride Action Network.<sup> </sup> Among the prominent signatories are Nobel Laureate Arvid Carlsson and William Marcus, PhD who served as the chief toxicologist of the EPA Water Division.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The above sampling of recent news items on fluoride brings into sharp focus just how urgent it is to carry out a critical reassessment of the mass fluoridation campaign that currently affects hundreds of millions of Americans. In order to better understand the massive deception surrounding this toxic chemical, we must look back to the sordid history of how fluoride was first introduced.</p>
<p><strong>How to Market a Toxic Waste</strong></p>
<p>“We would not purposely add arsenic to the water supply. And we would not purposely add lead. But we do add fluoride. The fact is that fluoride is more toxic than lead and just slightly less toxic than arsenic.”<sup> </sup><sup>11</sup></p>
<p>These words of Dr. John Yiamouyiannis may come as a shock to you because, if you’re like most Americans, you have positive associations with fluoride. You may envision tooth protection, strong bones, and a <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/government/">government</a> that cares about your dental needs. What you’ve probably never been told is that the fluoride added to drinking water and toothpaste is a crude industrial waste product of the aluminum and fertilizer industries, and a substance toxic enough to be used as rat poison. How is it that Americans have learned to love an environmental hazard? This phenomenon can be attributed to a carefully planned marketing program begun even before Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community to officially fluoridate its drinking water in 1945.<sup> </sup><sup>12</sup>   As a result of this ongoing campaign, nearly two-thirds of the nation has enthusiastically followed Grand Rapids’ example. But this push for fluoridation has less to do with a concern for America’s health than with industry’s penchant to expand at the expense of our nation’s well-being.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to understand about fluoride is that it’s the problem child of industry. Its toxicity was recognized at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when, in the 1850s iron and copper factories discharged it into the air and poisoned plants, animals, and people.<a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/fluoridekll.html#sdendnote13sym" name="sdendnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a>   The problem was exacerbated in the 1920s when rapid industrial growth meant massive pollution. Medical writer Joel Griffiths explains that “it was abundantly clear to both industry and <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/government/">government</a> that spectacular U.S. industrial expansion ­ and the economic and military power and vast profits it promised ­ would necessitate releasing millions of tons of waste fluoride into the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/environment/">environment</a>.”<sup>14</sup>  Their biggest fear was that “if serious injury to people were established, lawsuits alone could prove devastating to companies, while public outcry could force industry-wide government regulations, billions in pollution-control costs, and even mandatory changes in high-fluoride raw materials and profitable technologies.” <sup>15</sup></p>
<p>At first, industry could dispose of fluoride legally only in small amounts by selling it to insecticide and rat poison manufacturers.<sup> </sup><sup>16</sup>   Then a commercial outlet was devised in the 1930s when a connection was made between water supplies bearing traces of fluoride and lower rates of tooth decay. Griffiths writes that this was not a scientific breakthrough, but rather part of a “public disinformation campaign” by the aluminum industry “to convince the public that fluoride was safe and good.” Industry’s need prompted Alcoa-funded scientist Gerald J. Cox to announce that “The present trend toward complete removal of fluoride from water may need some reversal.” <sup>17</sup>   Griffiths writes:</p>
<p>“The big news in Cox’s announcement was that this ‘apparently worthless by-product’ had not only been proved safe (in low doses), but actually beneficial; it might reduce cavities in children. A proposal was in the air to add fluoride to the entire nation’s drinking water. While the dose to each individual would be low, ‘fluoridation’ on a national scale would require the annual addition of hundreds of thousands of tons of fluoride to the country’s drinking water.</p>
<p>“Government and industry ­ especially Alcoa ­ strongly supported intentional water fluoridation… [it] made possible a master public relations stroke ­ one that could keep scientists and the public off fluoride’s case for years to come. If the leaders of dentistry, medicine, and public health could be persuaded to endorse fluoride in the public’s drinking water, proclaiming to the nation that there was a ‘wide margin of safety,’ how were they going to turn around later and say industry’s fluoride pollution was dangerous?</p>
<p>“As for the public, if fluoride could be introduced as a health enhancing substance that should be added to the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/environment/">environment</a> for the children’s sake, those opposing it would look like quacks and lunatics….</p>
<p>“Back at the Mellon Institute, Alcoa’s Pittsburgh Industrial research lab, this news was galvanic. Alcoa-sponsored biochemist Gerald J. Cox immediately fluoridated some lab rats in a study and concluded that fluoride reduced cavities and that ‘The case should be regarded as proved.’ In a historic moment in 1939, the first public proposal that the U.S. should fluoridate its water supplies was made ­ not by a doctor, or dentist, but by Cox, an industry scientist working for a company threatened by fluoride damage claims.”<sup> </sup><sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Once the plan was put into action, industry was buoyant. They had finally found the channel for fluoride that they were looking for, and they were even cheered on by dentists, government agencies, and the public. Chemical Week, a publication for the chemical industry, described the tenor of the times: “All over the country, slide rules are getting warm as waterworks engineers figure the cost of adding fluoride to their water supplies.” They are riding a trend urged upon them, by the U.S. Public Health Service, the American Dental Association, the State Dental Health Directors, various state and local health bodies, and vocal women’s clubs from coast to coast. It adds up to a nice piece of business on all sides and many firms are cheering the PHS and similar groups as they plump for increasing adoption of fluoridation.”<sup> </sup><sup>19</sup></p>
<p>Such overwhelming acceptance allowed government and industry to proceed hastily, albeit irresponsibly. The Grand Rapids experiment was supposed to take 15 years, during which time health benefits and hazards were to be studied. In 1946, however, just one year into the experiment, six more U.S. cities adopted the process. By 1947, 87 more communities were treated; popular demand was the official reason for this unscientific haste.</p>
<p>The general public and its leaders did support the cause, but only after a massive government public relations campaign spearheaded by Edward L. Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud. Bernays, a public relations pioneer who has been called “the original spin doctor,”<sup> </sup><sup>20</sup>  was a masterful PR strategist. As a result of his influence, Griffiths writes, “Almost overnight…the popular image of fluoride ­ which at the time was being widely sold as rat and bug poison ­ became that of a beneficial provider of gleaming smiles, absolutely safe, and good for children, bestowed by a benevolent paternal government. Its opponents were permanently engraved on the public mind as crackpots and right-wing loonies.” <sup>21</sup></p>
<p>Griffiths explains that while opposition to fluoridation is usually associated with right-wingers, this picture is not totally accurate. He provides an interesting historical perspective on the anti-fluoridation stance:</p>
<p>“Fluoridation attracted opponents from every point on the continuum of politics and sanity. The prospect of the government mass-medicating the water supplies with a well-known rat poison to prevent a nonlethal disease flipped the switches of delusionals across the country ­ as well as generating concern among responsible scientists, doctors, and citizens.</p>
<p>“Moreover, by a fortuitous twist of circumstances, fluoride’s natural opponents on the left were alienated from the rest of the opposition. Oscar Ewing, a Federal Security Agency administrator, was a Truman “fair dealer” who pushed many progressive programs such as nationalized medicine. Fluoridation was lumped with his proposals. Inevitably, it was attacked by conservatives as a manifestation of “creeping socialism,” while the left rallied to its support. Later during the McCarthy era, the left was further alienated from the opposition when extreme right-wing groups, including the John Birch Society and the Ku Klux Klan, raved that fluoridation was a plot by the Soviet Union and/or communists in the government to poison America’s brain cells.</p>
<p>“It was a simple task for promoters, under the guidance of the ‘original spin doctor,’ to paint all opponents as deranged ­ and they played this angle to the hilt….</p>
<p>“Actually, many of the strongest opponents originally started out as proponents, but changed their minds after a close look at the evidence. And many opponents came to view fluoridation not as a communist plot, but simply as a capitalist-style con job of epic proportions. Some could be termed early environmentalists, such as the physicians George L. Waldbott and Frederick B. Exner, who first documented government-industry complicity in hiding the hazards of fluoride pollution from the public. Waldbott and Exner risked their careers in a clash with fluoride defenders, only to see their cause buried in toothpaste ads.”<sup> </sup><sup>22</sup></p>
<p>By 1950, fluoridation’s image was a sterling one, and there was not much <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/science/">science</a> could do at this point. The Public Health Service was fluoridation’s main source of funding as well as its promoter, and therefore caught in a fundamental conflict of interest.<sup> </sup><sup>12</sup>   If fluoridation were found to be unsafe and ineffective, and laws were repealed, the organization feared a loss of face, since scientists, politicians, dental groups, and physicians unanimously supported it. <sup>23</sup>  For this reason, studies concerning its effects were not undertaken. The Oakland Tribune noted this when it stated that “public health officials have often suppressed scientific doubts” about fluoridation.<sup>24</sup><sup> </sup>Waldbott sums up the situation when he says that from the beginning, the controversy over fluoridating water supplies was “a political, not a scientific health issue.”<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>The marketing of fluoride continues. In a 1983 letter from the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/environmental-protection-agency/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, then Deputy Assistant Administrator for Water, Rebecca Hammer, writes that the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/epa/">EPA</a> “regards [fluoridation] as an ideal environmental solution to a long-standing problem. By recovering by-product fluosilicic acid from fertilizer manufacturing, water and air pollution are minimized and water utilities have a low-cost source of fluoride available to them.”<sup> </sup><sup>26</sup>    A 1992 policy statement from the Department of Health and Human Services says, “A recent comprehensive PHS review of the benefits and potential health risks of fluoride has concluded that the practice of fluoridating community water supplies is safe and effective.” <sup>27</sup></p>
<p>According to the CDC website, about 200 million Americans in 16,500 communities are exposed to fluoridated water. Out of the 50 largest cities in the US, 43 have fluoridated water.<sup> </sup><sup>28</sup></p>
<p>To help celebrate fluoride’s widespread use, the media recently reported on the 50th anniversary of fluoridation in Grand Rapids. Newspaper articles titled “Fluoridation: a shining public health success”<sup> </sup><sup>29</sup>  and “After 50 years, fluoride still works with a smile”  <sup>30</sup>  painted glowing pictures of the practice. Had investigators looked more closely, though, they might have learned that children in Muskegon, Michigan, an unfluoridated “control” city, had equal drops in dental decay. They might also have learned of the other studies that dispute the supposed wonders of fluoride.</p>
<p><strong>The Fluoride Myth Doesn’t Hold Water</strong></p>
<p>The big hope for fluoride was its ability to immunize children’s developing teeth against cavities. Rates of dental caries were supposed to plummet in areas where water was treated. Yet decades of experience and worldwide research have contradicted this expectation numerous times. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<p>In British Columbia, only 11% of the population drinks fluoridated water, as opposed to 40-70% in other Canadian regions. Yet British Columbia has the lowest rate of tooth decay in Canada. In addition, the lowest rates of dental caries within the province are found in areas that do not have their water supplies fluoridated.<sup> </sup><sup>31</sup></p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/sierra-club/">Sierra Club</a> study, people in unfluoridated developing nations have fewer dental caries than those living in industrialized nations. As a result, they conclude that “fluoride is not essential to dental health.”<sup> </sup><sup>32</sup></p>
<p>In 1986-87, the largest study on fluoridation and tooth decay ever was performed. The subjects were 39,000 school children between 5 and 17 living in 84 areas around the country. A third of the places were fluoridated, a third were partially fluoridated, and a third were not. Results indicate no statistically significant differences in dental decay between fluoridated and unfluoridated cities.<sup> </sup><sup>33</sup></p>
<p>A World Health Organization survey reports a decline of dental decay in western Europe, which is 98% unfluoridated. They state that western Europe’s declining dental decay rates are equal to and sometimes better than those in the U.S.<sup> </sup><sup>34</sup></p>
<p>A 1992 University of Arizona study yielded surprising results when they found that “the more fluoride a child drinks, the more cavities appear in the teeth.”<sup> </sup><sup>35</sup></p>
<p>Although all Native American reservations are fluoridated, children living there have much higher incidences of dental decay and other oral health problems than do children living in other U.S. communities.<sup> </sup><sup>36</sup></p>
<p>In light of all the evidence, fluoride proponents now make more modest claims. For example, in 1988, the ADA professed that a 40- to 60% cavity reduction could be achieved with the help of fluoride. Now they claim an 18- to 25% reduction. Other promoters mention a 12% decline in tooth decay.</p>
<p>And some former supporters are even beginning to question the need for fluoridation altogether. In 1990, a National Institute for Dental Research report stated that “it is likely that if caries in children remain at low levels or decline further, the necessity of continuing the current variety and extent of fluoride-based prevention programs will be questioned.”<sup> </sup><sup>37</sup></p>
<p>Most government agencies, however, continue to ignore the scientific evidence and to market fluoridation by making fictional claims about its benefits and pushing for its expansion. For instance, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, “National surveys of oral health dating back several decades document continuing decreases in tooth decay in children, adults and senior citizens. Nevertheless, there are parts of the country and particular populations that remain without protection. For these reasons, the U.S. PHS…has set a national goal for the year 2000 that 75% of persons served by community water systems will have access to optimally fluoridated drinking water; currently this figure is just about 60%. The year 2000 target goal is both desirable and yet challenging, based on past progress and continuing evidence of effectiveness and safety of this public health measure.”<sup> </sup><sup>38</sup></p>
<p>This statement is flawed on several accounts. First, as we’ve seen, research does not support the effectiveness of fluoridation for preventing tooth disease. Second, purported benefits are supposedly for children, not adults and senior citizens. At about age 13, any advantage fluoridation might offer comes to an end, and less than 1% of the fluoridated water supply reaches this population.<sup> </sup> And third, fluoridation has never been proven safe. On the contrary, several studies directly link fluoridation to skeletal fluorosis, dental fluorosis, and several rare forms of cancer. This alone should frighten us away from its use.</p>
<p><strong>Biological Safety Concerns</strong></p>
<p>Only a small margin separates supposedly beneficial fluoride levels from amounts that are known to cause adverse effects. Dr. James Patrick, a former antibiotics research scientist at the National Institutes of Health, describes the predicament:</p>
<p>“[There is] a very low margin of safety involved in fluoridating water. A concentration of about 1 ppm is recommended…in several countries, severe fluorosis has been documented from water supplies containing only 2 or 3 ppm. In the development of drugs…we generally insist on a therapeutic index (margin of safety) of the order of 100; a therapeutic index of 2 or 3 is totally unacceptable, yet that is what has been proposed for public water supplies.”<sup>39</sup><sup> </sup></p>
<p>Other countries argue that even 1 ppm is not a safe concentration. Canadian studies, for example, imply that children under three should have no fluoride whatsoever. The Journal of the Canadian Dental Association states that “Fluoride supplements should not be recommended for children less than 3 years old.”<sup> </sup><sup>40</sup>   Since these supplements contain the same amount of fluoride as water does, they are basically saying that children under the age of three shouldn’t be drinking fluoridated water at all, under any circumstances. Japan has reduced the amount of fluoride in their drinking water to one-eighth of what is recommended in the U.S. Instead of 1 milligram per liter, they use less than 15 hundredths of a milligram per liter as the upper limit allowed. <sup>41</sup></p>
<p>Even supposing that low concentrations are safe, there is no way to control how much fluoride different people consume, as some take in a lot more than others. For example, laborers, athletes, diabetics, and those living in hot or dry regions can all be expected to drink more water, and therefore more fluoride (in fluoridated areas) than others.<sup> </sup><sup>42</sup>   Due to such wide variations in water consumption, it is impossible to scientifically control what dosage of fluoride a person receives via the water supply.<sup>43</sup></p>
<p>Another concern is that fluoride is not found only in drinking water; it is everywhere. Fluoride is found in foods that are processed with it, which, in the United States, include nearly all bottled drinks and canned foods.<sup> </sup><sup>44</sup>  Researchers writing in The Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry have found that fruit juices, in particular, contain significant amounts of fluoride. In one study, a variety of popular juices and juice blends were analyzed and it was discovered that 42% of the samples examined had more than l ppm of fluoride, with some brands of grape juice containing much higher levels ­ up to 6.8 ppm! The authors cite the common practice of using fluoride-containing insecticide in growing grapes as a factor in these high levels, and they suggest that the fluoride content of beverages be printed on their labels, as is other nutritional information. <sup>45</sup>  Considering how much juice some children ingest, and the fact that youngsters often insist on particular brands that they consume day after day, labeling seems like a prudent idea. But beyond this is the larger issue that this study brings up: Is it wise to subject children and others who are heavy juice drinkers to additional fluoride in their water?</p>
<p>Here’s a little-publicized reality: Cooking can greatly increase a food’s fluoride content. Peas, for example, contain 12 micrograms of fluoride when raw and 1500 micrograms after they are cooked in fluoridated water, which is a tremendous difference. Also, we should keep in mind that fluoride is an ingredient in pharmaceuticals, aerosols, insecticides, and pesticides.</p>
<p>And of course, toothpastes. It’s interesting to note that in the 1950s, fluoridated toothpastes were required to carry warnings on their labels saying that they were not to be used in areas where water was already fluoridated. Crest toothpaste went so far as to write: “Caution: Children under 6 should not use Crest.” These regulations were dropped in 1958, although no new research was available to prove that the overdose hazard no longer existed.<sup> </sup><sup>46</sup></p>
<p>Today, common fluoride levels in toothpaste are 1000 ppm. Research chemist Woodfun Ligon notes that swallowing a small amount adds substantially to fluoride intake.<sup> </sup><sup>47</sup> Dentists say that children commonly ingest up to 0.5 mg of fluoride a day from toothpaste. <sup>48</sup></p>
<p>This inevitably raises another issue: How safe is all this fluoride? According to scientists and informed doctors, such as Dr. John Lee, it is not safe at all. Dr. Lee first took an anti-fluoridation stance back in 1972, when as chairman of an environmental health committee for a local medical society, he was asked to state their position on the subject. He stated that after investigating the references given by both pro- and anti-fluoridationists, the group discovered three important things:</p>
<p>“One, the claims of benefit of fluoride, the 60% reduction of cavities, was not established by any of these studies. Two, we found that the investigations into the toxic side effects of fluoride have not been done in any way that was acceptable. And three, we discovered that the estimate of the amount of fluoride in the food chain, in the total daily fluoride intake, had been measured in 1943, and not since then. By adding the amount of fluoride that we now have in the food chain, which comes from food processing with fluoridated water, plus all the fluoridated toothpaste that was not present in 1943, we found that the daily intake of fluoride was far in excess of what was considered optimal.”<sup> </sup><sup>49</sup></p>
<p>What happens when fluoride intake exceeds the optimal? The inescapable fact is that this substance has been associated with severe health problems, ranging from skeletal and dental fluorosis to bone fractures, to fluoride poisoning, and even to cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Skeletal Fluorosis</strong></p>
<p>When fluoride is ingested, approximately 93% of it is absorbed into the bloodstream. A good part of the material is excreted, but the rest is deposited in the bones and teeth, and is capable of causing a crippling skeletal fluorosis. This is a condition that can damage the musculoskeletal and nervous systems and result in muscle wasting, limited joint motion, spine deformities, and calcification of the ligaments, as well as neurological deficits.</p>
<p>Large numbers of people in Japan, China, India, the Middle East, and Africa have been diagnosed with skeletal fluorosis from drinking naturally fluoridated water. In India alone, nearly a million people suffer from the affliction.<sup> </sup><sup>39</sup>   While only a dozen cases of skeletal fluorosis have been reported in the United States, Chemical and Engineering News states that “critics of the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/epa/">EPA</a> standard speculate that there probably have been many more cases of fluorosis ­ even crippling fluorosis ­ than the few reported in the literature because most doctors in the U.S. have not studied the disease and do not know how to diagnose it.” <sup>50</sup></p>
<p>Radiologic changes in bone occur when fluoride exposure is 5 mg/day, according to the late Dr. George Waldbott, author of Fluoridation: The Great Dilemma. While this 5 mg/day level is the amount of fluoride ingested by most people living in fluoridated areas,<sup> </sup><sup>51</sup>   the number increases for diabetics and laborers, who can ingest up to 20 mg of fluoride daily. In addition, a survey conducted by the Department of Agriculture shows that 3% of the U.S. population drinks 4 liters or more of water every day. If these individuals live in areas where the water contains a fluoride level of 4 ppm, allowed by the EPA, they are ingesting 16 mg/day from the consumption of water alone, and are thus at greater risk for getting skeletal fluorosis. <sup>52</sup></p>
<p><strong>Dental Fluorosis</strong></p>
<p>According to a 1989 National Institute for Dental Research study, 1-2% of children living in areas fluoridated at 1 ppm develop dental fluorosis, that is, permanently stained, brown mottled teeth. Up to 23% of children living in areas naturally fluoridated at 4 ppm develop severe dental fluorosis.<sup> </sup><sup>53</sup>  Other research gives higher figures. The publication Health Effects of Ingested Fluoride, put out by the National Academy of Sciences, reports that in areas with optimally fluoridated water (1 ppm, either natural or added), dental fluorosis levels in recent years ranged from 8 to 51%. Recently, a prevalence of slightly over 80% was reported in children 12-14 years old in Augusta, Georgia.</p>
<p>Fluoride is a noteworthy chemical additive in that its officially acknowledged benefit and damage levels are about the same. Writing in The Progressive, <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/science/">science</a> journalist Daniel Grossman elucidates this point: “Though many beneficial <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/chemicals/">chemicals</a> are dangerous when consumed at excessive levels, fluoride is unique because the amount that dentists recommend to prevent cavities is about the same as the amount that causes dental fluorosis.”<sup> </sup><sup>54</sup>   Although the American Dental Association and the government consider dental fluorosis only a cosmetic problem, the American Journal of Public Health says that “…brittleness of moderately and severely mottled teeth may be associated with elevated caries levels.” <sup>45</sup>   In other words, in these cases the fluoride is causing the exact problem that it’s supposed to prevent. Yiamouyiannis adds, “In highly naturally-fluoridated areas, the teeth actually crumble as a result. These are the first visible symptoms of fluoride poisoning.” <sup>55</sup></p>
<p>Also, when considering dental fluorosis, there are factors beyond the physical that you can’t ignore ­ the negative psychological effects of having moderately to severely mottled teeth. These were recognized in a 1984 National Institute of Mental Health panel that looked into this problem.<sup> </sup></p>
<p>A telling trend is that TV commercials for toothpaste, and toothpaste tubes themselves, are now downplaying fluoride content as a virtue. This was noted in an article in the Sarasota/Florida ECO Report,<sup> </sup><sup>56</sup> whose author, George Glasser, feels that manufacturers are distancing themselves from the additive because of fears of lawsuits. The climate is ripe for these, and Glasser points out that such a class action suit has already been filed in England against the manufacturers of fluoride-containing products on behalf of children suffering from dental fluorosis.</p>
<p><strong>Bone Fractures</strong></p>
<p>At one time, fluoride therapy was recommended for building denser bones and preventing fractures associated with osteoporosis. Now several articles in peer-reviewed journals suggest that fluoride actually causes more harm than good, as it is associated with bone breakage. Three studies reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed links between hip fractures and fluoride.<sup> </sup><a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/fluoridekll.html#sdendnote57sym" name="sdendnote57anc"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/fluoridekll.html#sdendnote58sym" name="sdendnote58anc"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/fluoridekll.html#sdendnote59sym" name="sdendnote59anc"><sup>59</sup></a> Findings here were, for instance, that there is “a small but significant increase in the risk of hip fractures in both men and women exposed to artificial fluoridation at 1 ppm.”   In addition, the New England Journal of Medicine reports that people given fluoride to cure their osteoporosis actually wound up with an increased nonvertebral fracture rate. <sup>60</sup>  Austrian researchers have also found that fluoride tablets make bones more susceptible to fractures.<sup>61</sup> The U.S. National Research Council states that the U.S. hip fracture rate is now the highest in the world. <sup>62</sup></p>
<p>Louis V. Avioli, professor at the Washington University School of Medicine, says in a 1987 review of the subject: “Sodium fluoride therapy is accompanied by so many medical complications and side effects that it is hardly worth exploring in depth as a therapeutic mode for postmenopausal osteoporosis, since it fails to decrease the propensity for hip fractures and increases the incidence of stress fractures in the extremities.”<sup> </sup><sup>63</sup></p>
<p><strong>Fluoride Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>In May 1992, 260 people were poisoned, and one man died, in Hooper Bay, Alaska, after drinking water contaminated with 150 ppm of fluoride. The accident was attributed to poor equipment and an unqualified operator.<sup> </sup><sup>55</sup>   Was this a fluke? Not at all. Over the years, the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/cdc/">CDC</a> has recorded several incidents of excessive fluoride permeating the water supply and sickening or killing people. We don’t usually hear about these occurrences in news reports, but interested citizens have learned the truth from data obtained under the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/freedom/">Freedom</a> of Information Act. Here is a partial list of toxic spills we have not been told about:</p>
<p>July 1993 ­ Chicago, Illinois: Three dialysis patients died and five experienced toxic reactions to the fluoridated water used in the treatment process. The CDC was asked to investigate, but to date there have been no press releases.</p>
<p>May 1993 ­ Kodiak, Alaska (Old Harbor): The population was warned not to consume water due to high fluoride levels. They were also cautioned against boiling the water, since this concentrates the substance and worsens the danger. Although equipment appeared to be functioning normally, 22-24 ppm of fluoride was found in a sample.</p>
<p>July 1992 ­ Marin County, California: A pump malfunction allowed too much fluoride into the Bon Tempe treatment plant. Two million gallons of fluoridated water were diverted to Phoenix Lake, elevating the lake surface by more than two inches and forcing some water over the spillway.</p>
<p>December 1991 ­ Benton Harbor, Michigan: A faulty pump allowed approximately 900 gallons of hydrofluosilicic acid to leak into a chemical storage building at the water plant. City engineer Roland Klockow stated, “The concentrated hydrofluosilicic acid was so corrosive that it ate through more than two inches of concrete in the storage building.” This water did not reach water consumers, but fluoridation was stopped until June 1993. The original equipment was only two years old.</p>
<p>July 1991 ­ Porgate, Michigan: After a fluoride injector pump failed, fluoride levels reached 92 ppm and resulted in approximately 40 children developing abdominal pains, sickness, vomiting, and diarrhea at a school arts and crafts show.</p>
<p>November 1979 ­ Annapolis, Maryland: One patient died and eight became ill after renal dialysis treatment. Symptoms included cardiac arrest (resuscitated), hypotension, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a whole gamut of intestinal problems. Patients not on dialysis also reported nausea, headaches, cramps, diarrhea, and dizziness. The fluoride level was later found to be 35 ppm; the problem was traced to a valve at a water plant that had been left open all night.<sup> </sup><sup>64</sup></p>
<p>Instead of addressing fluoridation’s problematic safety record, officials have chosen to cover it up. For example, the ADA says in one booklet distributed to health agencies that “Fluoride feeders are designed to stop operating when a malfunction occurs… so prolonged over-fluoridation becomes a mechanical impossibility.”<sup> </sup> <sup> </sup> In addition, the information that does reach the population after an accident is woefully inaccurate. A spill in Annapolis, Maryland, placed thousands at risk, but official reports reduced the number to eight. <sup>65</sup>  Perhaps officials are afraid they will invite more lawsuits like the one for $480 million by the wife of a dialysis patient who became brain-injured as the result of fluoride poisoning.</p>
<p>Not all fluoride poisoning is accidental. For decades, industry has knowingly released massive quantities of fluoride into the air and water. Disenfranchised communities, with people least able to fight back, are often the victims. Medical writer Joel Griffiths relays this description of what industrial pollution can do, in this case to a devastatingly poisoned Indian reservation:</p>
<p>“Cows crawled around the pasture on their bellies, inching along like giant snails. So crippled by bone disease they could not stand up, this was the only way they could graze. Some died kneeling, after giving birth to stunted calves. Others kept on crawling until, no longer able to chew because their teeth had crumbled down to the nerves, they began to starve….” They were the cattle of the Mohawk Indians on the New York-Canadian St. Regis Reservation during the period 1960-1975, when industrial pollution devastated the herd ­ and along with it, the Mohawks’ way of life….Mohawk children, too, have shown signs of damage to bones and teeth.”<sup> </sup><sup>66</sup></p>
<p>Mohawks filed suit against the Reynolds Metals Company and the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) in 1960, but ended up settling out of court, where they received $650,000 for their cows.<sup> </sup><sup>67</sup></p>
<p>Fluoride is one of industry’s major pollutants, and no one remains immune to its effects. In 1989, 155,000 tons were being released annually into the air,<sup> </sup>   and 500,000 tons a year were disposed of in our lakes, rivers, and oceans. <sup>68</sup><sup><br />
</sup></p>
<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Numerous studies demonstrate links between fluoridation and cancer; however, agencies promoting fluoride consistently refute or cover up these findings.</p>
<p>In 1977, Dr. John Yiamouyiannis and Dr. Dean Burk, former chief chemist at the National Cancer Institute, released a study that linked fluoridation to 10,000 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. Their inquiry, which compared cancer deaths in the ten largest fluoridated American cities to those in the ten largest unfluoridated cities between 1940 and 1950, discovered a 5% greater rate in the fluoridated areas.<sup> </sup><sup>69</sup>  The NCI disputed these findings, since an earlier analysis of theirs apparently failed to pick up these extra deaths. Federal authorities claimed that Yiamouyiannis and Burk were in error, and that any increase was caused by statistical changes over the years in age, gender, and racial composition. <sup>70</sup></p>
<p>In order to settle the question of whether or not fluoride is a carcinogen, a Congressional subcommittee instructed the National Toxicology Program (NTP) to perform another investigation.<sup> </sup><sup>71</sup>  That study, due in 1980, was not released until 1990. However, in 1986, while the study was delayed, the EPA raised the standard fluoride level in drinking water from 2.4 to 4 ppm. <sup>72</sup>   After this step, some of the government’s own employees in NFFE Local 2050 took what the Oakland Tribune termed the “remarkable step of denouncing that action as political.” <sup>73</sup></p>
<p>When the NTP study results became known in early 1990, union president Dr. Robert Carton, who works in the EPA’s Toxic Substances Division, published a statement. It read, in part: “Four years ago, NFFE Local 2050, which represents all 1100 professionals at EPA headquarters, alerted then Administrator Lee Thomas to the fact that the scientific support documents for the fluoride in drinking water standard were fatally flawed. The fluoride juggernaut proceeded as it apparently had for the last 40 years ­ without any regard for the facts or concern for public health.</p>
<p>“EPA raised the allowed level of fluoride before the results of the rat/mouse study ordered by Congress in 1977 was complete. Today, we find out how irresponsible that decision was. The results reported by NTP, and explained today by Dr. Yiamouyiannis, are, as he notes, not surprising considering the vast amount of data that caused the animal study to be conducted in the first place. The results are not surprising to NFFE Local 2050 either. Four years ago we realized that the claim that there was no evidence that fluoride could cause genetic effects or cancer could not be supported by the shoddy document thrown together by the EPA contractor.</p>
<p>“It was apparent to us that EPA bowed to political pressure without having done an in-depth, independent analysis, using in-house experts, of the currently existing data that show fluoride causes genetic effects, promotes the growth of cancerous tissue, and is likely to cause cancer in humans. If EPA had done so, it would have been readily apparent ­ as it was to Congress in 1977 ­ that there were serious reasons to believe in a cancer threat.</p>
<p>“The behavior by EPA in this affair raises questions about the integrity of science at EPA and the role of professional scientists, lawyers and engineers who provide the interpretation of the available data and the judgements necessary to protect the public health and the environment. Are scientists at EPA there to arrange facts to fit preconceived conclusions? Does the Agency have a responsibility to develop world-class experts in the risks posed by <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/chemicals/">chemicals</a> we are exposed to every day, or is it permissible for EPA to cynically shop around for contractors who will provide them the ‘correct’ answers?”<sup> </sup><sup>74</sup><br />
What were the NTP study results? Out of 130 male rats that ingested 45 to 79 ppm of fluoride, 5 developed osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer. There were cases, in both males and females at those doses, of squamous cell carcinoma in the mouth. <sup>75</sup>  Both rats and mice had dose-related fluorosis of the teeth, and female rats suffered osteosclerosis of the long bones.<sup>76</sup></p>
<p>When Yiamouyiannis analyzed the same data, he found mice with a particularly rare form of liver cancer, known as hepatocholangiocarcinoma. This cancer is so rare, according to Yiamouyiannis, that the odds of its appearance in this study by chance are 1 in 2 million in male mice and l in 100,000 in female mice.<sup> </sup>   He also found precancerous changes in oral squamous cells, an increase in squamous cell tumors and cancers, and thyroid follicular cell tumors as a result of increasing levels of fluoride in drinking water. <sup>77</sup></p>
<p>A March 13, 1990, New York Times article commented on the NTP findings: “Previous animal tests suggesting that water fluoridation might pose risks to humans have been widely discounted as technically flawed, but the latest investigation carefully weeded out sources of experimental or statistical error, many scientists say, and cannot be discounted.”<sup> </sup><sup>78</sup>  In the same article, biologist Dr. Edward Groth notes: “The importance of this study…is that it is the first fluoride bioassay giving positive results in which the latest state-of-the-art procedures have been rigorously applied. It has to be taken seriously.” <sup>71</sup></p>
<p>On February 22, 1990, the Medical Tribune, an international medical news weekly received by 125,000 doctors, offered the opinion of a federal scientist who preferred to remain anonymous:</p>
<p>“It is difficult to see how EPA can fail to regulate fluoride as a carcinogen in light of what NTP has found. Osteosarcomas are an extremely unusual result in rat carcinogenicity tests. Toxicologists tell me that the only other substance that has produced this is radium….The fact that this is a highly atypical form of cancer implicates fluoride as the cause. Also, the osteosarcomas appeared to be dose-related, and did not occur in controls, making it a clean study.”<sup> </sup><sup>79</sup></p>
<p>Public health officials were quick to assure a concerned public that there was nothing to worry about! The ADA said the occurrence of cancers in the lab may not be relevant to humans since the level of fluoridation in the experimental animals’ water was so high.<sup> </sup><sup>80</sup>   But the Federal Register, which is the handbook of government practices, disagrees: “The high exposure of experimental animals to toxic agents is a necessary and valid method of discovering possible carcinogenic hazards in man. To disavow the findings of this test would be to disavow those of all such tests, since they are all conducted according to this standard.” <sup>73</sup> <sup> </sup> As a February 5, 1990, Newsweek article pointed out, “such megadosing is standard toxicological practice. It’s the only way to detect an effect without using an impossibly large number of test animals to stand in for the humans exposed to the substance.” <sup>81</sup> And as the Safer Water Foundation explains, higher doses are generally administered to test animals to compensate for the animals’ shorter life span and because humans are generally more vulnerable than test animals on a body-weight basis. <sup>82</sup></p>
<p>Several other studies link fluoride to genetic damage and cancer. An article in Mutation Research says that a study by Proctor and Gamble, the very company that makes Crest toothpaste, did research showing that 1 ppm fluoride causes genetic damage.<sup>83</sup><sup> </sup>Results were never published but Proctor and Gamble called them “clean,” meaning animals were supposedly free of malignant tumors. Not so, according to scientists who believe some of the changes observed in test animals could be interpreted as precancerous. <sup>84</sup>   Yiamouyiannis says the Public Health Service sat on the data, which were finally released via a <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/freedom/">Freedom</a> of Information Act request in 1989. “Since they are biased, they have tried to cover up harmful effects,” he says. “But the data speaks for itself. Half the amount of fluoride that is found in the New York City drinking water causes genetic damage.” <sup>46</sup></p>
<p>A National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences publication, Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis, also linked fluoride to genetic toxicity when it stated that “in cultured human and rodent cells, the weight of evidence leads to the conclusion that fluoride exposure results in increased chromosome aberrations.”<sup> </sup><sup>85</sup> The result of this is not only birth defects but the mutation of normal cells into cancer cells. The Journal of Carcinogenesis further states that “fluoride not only has the ability to transform normal cells into cancer cells but also to enhance the cancer-causing properties of other chemicals.” <sup>86</sup></p>
<p>Surprisingly, the PHS put out a report called Review of fluoride: benefits and risks, in which they showed a substantially higher incidence of bone cancer in young men exposed to fluoridated water compared to those who were not. The New Jersey Department of Health also found that the risk of bone cancer was about three times as high in fluoridated areas as in nonfluoridated areas.<sup> </sup><sup>87</sup></p>
<p>Despite cover-up attempts, the light of knowledge is filtering through to some enlightened scientists. Regarding animal test results, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, James Huff, does say that “the reason these animals got a few osteosarcomas was because they were given fluoride…Bone is the target organ for fluoride.”  Toxicologist William Marcus adds that “fluoride is a carcinogen by any standard we use. I believe EPA should act immediately to protect the public, not just on the cancer data, but on the evidence of bone fractures, arthritis, mutagenicity, and other effects.” <sup>88</sup></p>
<p><strong>The Challenge of Eliminating Fluoride</strong></p>
<p>Given all the scientific challenges to the idea of the safety of fluoride, why does it remain a protected contaminant? As Susan Pare of the Center for Health Action asks, “…even if fluoride in the water did reduce tooth decay, which it does not, how can the EPA allow a substance more toxic than Alar, red dye #3, and vinyl chloride to be injected purposely into drinking water?”<sup> </sup><sup>89</sup></p>
<p>This is certainly a logical question and, with all the good science that seems to exist on the subject, you would think that there would be a great deal of interest in getting fluoride out of our water supply. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case. As Dr. William Marcus, a senior science advisor in the EPA’s Office of Drinking Water, has found, the top governmental priority has been to sweep the facts under the rug and, if need be, to suppress truth-tellers. Marcus explains<sup> </sup><sup>90</sup>  that fluoride is one of the chemicals the EPA specifically regulates, and that he was following the data coming in on fluoride very carefully when a determination was going to be made on whether the levels should be changed. He discovered that the data were not being heeded. But that was only the beginning of the story for him. Marcus recounts what happened:</p>
<p>“The studies that were done by Botel Northwest showed that there was an increased level of bone cancer and other types of cancer in animals….in that same study, there were very rare liver cancers, according to the board-certified veterinary pathologists at the contractor, Botel. Those really were very upsetting because they were hepatocholangeal carcinomas, very rare liver cancers….Then there were several other kinds of cancers that were found in the jaw and other places.</p>
<p>“I felt at that time that the reports were alarming. They showed that the levels of fluoride that can cause cancers in animals are actually lower than those levels ingested in people (who take lower amounts but for longer periods of time).</p>
<p>“I went to a meeting that was held in Research Triangle Park, in April 1990, in which the National Toxicology Program was presenting their review of the study. I went with several colleagues of mine, one of whom was a board-certified veterinary pathologist who originally reported hepatocholangeal carcinoma as a separate entity in rats and mice. I asked him if he would look at the slides to see if that really was a tumor or if the pathologists at Botel had made an error. He told me after looking at the slides that, in fact, it was correct.</p>
<p>“At the meeting, every one of the cancers reported by the contractor had been downgraded by the National Toxicology Program. I have been in the toxicology business looking at studies of this nature for nearly 25 years and I have never before seen every single cancer endpoint downgraded…. I found that very suspicious and went to see an investigator in the Congress at the suggestion of my friend, Bob Carton. This gentleman and his staff investigated very thoroughly and found out that the scientists at the National Toxicology Program down at Research Triangle Park had been coerced by their superiors to change their findings.”<sup>91</sup></p>
<p>Once Dr. Marcus acted on his findings, something ominous started to happen in his life: “…I wrote an internal memorandum and gave it to my supervisors. I waited for a month without hearing anything. Usually, you get a feedback in a week or so. I wrote another memorandum to a person who was my second-line supervisor explaining that if there was even a slight chance of increased cancer in the general population, since 140 million people were potentially ingesting this material, that the deaths could be in the many thousands. Then I gave a copy of the memorandum to the Fluoride Work Group, who waited some time and then released it to the press.</p>
<p>“Once it got into the press all sorts of things started happening at EPA. I was getting disciplinary threats, being isolated, and all kinds of things which ultimately resulted in them firing me on March 15, 1992.”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>In order to be reinstated at work, Dr. Marcus took his case to court. In the process, he learned that the government had engaged in various illegal activities, including 70 felony counts, in order to get him fired. At the same time, those who committed perjury were not held accountable for it. In fact, they were rewarded for their efforts:</p>
<p>“When we finally got the EPA to the courtroom…they admitted to doing several things to get me fired. We had notes of a meeting…that showed that fluoride was one of the main topics discussed and that it was agreed that they would fire me with the help of the Inspector General. When we got them on the stand and showed them the memoranda, they finally remembered and said, oh yes, we lied about that in our previous statements.</p>
<p>“Then…they admitted to shredding more than 70 documents that they had in hand ­ Freedom of Information requests. That’s a felony…. In addition, they charged me with stealing time from the government. They…tried to show…that I had been doing private work on government time and getting paid for it. When we came to court, I was able to show that the time cards they produced were forged, and forged by the Inspector General’s staff….”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>For all his efforts, Dr. Marcus was rehired, but nothing else has changed: “The EPA was ordered to rehire me, which they did. They were given a whole series of requirements to be met, such as paying me my back pay, restoring my leave, privileges, and sick leave and annual leave. The only thing they’ve done is put me back to work. They haven’t given me any of those things that they were required to do.”<sup>92</sup></p>
<p>What is at the core of such ruthless tactics? John Yiamouyiannis feels that the central concern of government is to protect industry, and that the motivating force behind fluoride use is the need of certain businesses to dump their toxic waste products somewhere. They try to be inconspicuous in the disposal process and not make waves. “As is normal, the solution to pollution is dilution. You poison everyone a little bit rather than poison a few people a lot. This way, people don’t know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Since the Public Health Service has promoted the fluoride myth for over 50 years, they’re concerned about protecting their reputation. So scientists like Dr. Marcus, who know about the dangers, are intimidated into keeping silent. Otherwise, they jeopardize their careers. Dr. John Lee elaborates: “Back in 1943, the PHS staked their professional careers on the benefits and safety of fluoride. It has since become bureaucratized. Any public health official who criticizes fluoride, or even hints that perhaps it was an unwise decision, is at risk of losing his career entirely. This has happened time and time again. Public health officials such as Dr. Gray in British Columbia and Dr. Colquhoun in New Zealand found no benefit from fluoridation. When they reported these results, they immediately lost their careers…. This is what happens ­ the public health officials who speak out against fluoride are at great risk of losing their careers on the spot.”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>Yiamouyiannis adds that for the authorities to admit that they’re wrong would be devastating. “It would show that their reputations really don’t mean that much…. They don’t have the scientific background. As <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/ralph-nader/">Ralph Nader</a> once said, if they admit they’re wrong on fluoridation, people would ask, and legitimately so, what else have they not told us right?”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>Accompanying a loss in status would be a tremendous loss in revenue. Yiamouyiannis points out that “the indiscriminate careless handling of fluoride has a lot of companies, such as Exxon, U.S. Steel, and Alcoa, making tens of billions of dollars in extra profits at our expense…. For them to go ahead now and admit that this is bad, this presents a problem, a threat, would mean tens of billions of dollars in lost profit because they would have to handle fluoride properly. Fluoride is present in everything from phosphate fertilizers to cracking agents for the petroleum industry.”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>Fluoride could only be legally disposed of at a great cost to industry. As Dr. Bill Marcus explains, “There are prescribed methods for disposal and they’re very expensive. Fluoride is a very potent poison. It’s a registered pesticide, used for killing rats or mice…. If it were to be disposed of, it would require a class-one landfill. That would cost the people who are producing aluminum or fertilizer about $7000+ per 5000- to 6000-gallon truckload to dispose of it. It’s highly corrosive.”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>Another problem is that the U.S. judicial system, even when convinced of the dangers, is powerless to change policy. Yiamouyiannis tells of his involvement in court cases in Pennsylvania and Texas in which, while the judges were convinced that fluoride was a health hazard, they did not have the jurisdiction to grant relief from fluoridation. That would have to be done, it was ultimately found, through the legislative process.<sup> </sup>   Interestingly, the judiciary seems to have more power to effect change in other countries. Yiamouyiannis states that when he presented the same technical evidence in Scotland, the Scottish court outlawed fluoridation based on the evidence.</p>
<p>Indeed, most of Western Europe has rejected fluoridation on the grounds that it is unsafe. In 1971, after 11 years of testing, Sweden’s Nobel Medical Institute recommended against fluoridation, and the process was banned.<sup>93</sup> The Netherlands outlawed the practice in 1976, after 23 years of tests. France decided against it after consulting with its Pasteur Institute<sup>64</sup>   and West Germany, now Germany, rejected the practice because the recommended dosage of 1 ppm was “too close to the dose at which long-term damage to the human body is to be expected.” <sup>84</sup>   Dr. Lee sums it up: “All of western Europe, except one or two test towns in Spain, has abandoned fluoride as a public health plan. It is not put in the water anywhere. They all established test cities and found that the benefits did not occur and the toxicity was evident.”<sup>94</sup></p>
<p>Isn’t it time the United States followed Western Europe’s example? While the answer is obvious, it is also apparent that government policy is unlikely to change without public support. We therefore must communicate with legislators, and insist on one of our most precious resources ­ pure, unadulterated drinking water. Yiamouyiannis urges all American people to do so, pointing out that public pressure has gotten fluoride out of the water in places like Los Angeles; Newark and Jersey City in New Jersey; and <sup>95</sup>Bedford, Massachusetts.<sup> </sup><sup>46</sup> <sup> </sup> He emphasizes the immediacy of the problem: “There is no question with regard to fluoridation of public water supplies. It is absolutely unsafe…and should be stopped immediately. This is causing more destruction to human health than any other single substance added purposely or inadvertently to the water supply. We’re talking about 35,000 excess deaths a year…10,000 cancer deaths a year…130 million people who are being chronically poisoned. We’re not talking about dropping dead after drinking a glass of fluoridated water…. It takes its toll on human health and life, glass after glass.” <sup>96</sup></p>
<p>There is also a moral issue in the debate that has largely escaped notice. According to columnist James Kilpatrick, it is “the right of each person to control the drugs he or she takes.” Kilpatrick calls fluoridation compulsory mass medication, a procedure that violates the principles of medical ethics.<sup> </sup><sup>97</sup>   A New York Times editorial agrees:</p>
<p>“In light of the uncertainty, critics [of fluoridation] argue that administrative bodies are unjustified in imposing fluoridation on communities without obtaining public consent…. The real issue here is not just the scientific debate. The question is whether any establishment has the right to decide that benefits outweigh risks and impose involuntary medication on an entire population. In the case of fluoridation, the dental establishment has made opposition to fluoridation seem intellectually disreputable. Some people regard that as tyranny.”<sup> </sup><sup>98</sup></p>

Anyone who has studied history knows that the life of a nation as well as its citizens can turn on a dime. On November 22, 1963, the fate of the United States took a dramatic turn for the worse. On that fateful day, some very evil forces asserted their absolute control over the country. This is significant because some of these same evil forces, as well as their descendants are actively enslaving America today.</p>
<h2>John Kennedy An Unlikely President</h2>
<p>John Kennedy was never a perfect man and his exploits with many beautiful and often controversial women, such as Ingrid Arvid, Judith Exner and Marilyn Monroe speaks to JFK’s imperfections. In fact, the present day corporate controlled media has continually revealed JFK’s womanizing ways as an attempt to remove any sympathy for the slain President.</p>
<p>JFK had the dubious legacy of being born into a family of very active criminality. His father, the former ambassador to England, stock market insider trader and mafia bootlegger, Joseph Kennedy, used his underworld ties to convince Meyer Lansky as well as key members of the Chicago mafia to steal the Cook County, IL., presidential election of 1960.</p>
<p>Illinois was the ultimate swing state. If JFK had not carried Cook County, Illinois, the presidency would have fallen to Nixon. Nixon was the insider’s choice. As Vice-President, he circumvented Ike and exacerbated the crisis situation in Southeast Asia on behalf of the furtherance of the CIA’s heroin trafficking through the infamous “Golden Triangle”. Nixon was in bed with the military industrial complex as Ike called it in his farewell address. Nixon was subservient to the whims of the Federal Reserve and ran interference for them, often to the chagrin of Ike, who desperately wanted to dump Nixon from the 1956 Republican ticket. Nixon was the elite’s errand boy, however, what the elite did not count on was the dramatic impact that the combination of television and JFK’s personal charm would play in the outcome of the 1960 election.</p>
<p><img alt="nixon jfk debates" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/nixon-jfk-debates.jpg" width="251" height="201" />In the famous Nixon-Kennedy debates, which were simulcast on radio and television, Nixon actually won among radio listeners. However, among the largest audience, the television audience, JFK won hands down and history was changed. JFK’s charismatic appeal was something that the elite had underestimated. The insiders were left to deal with the son of a criminal and most likely they thought they could work with the son of the Adolph Hitler supporting and bootlegging thug.</p>
<h2>JFK Became a Changed Man</h2>
<p>When JFK entered the White House, his party ways came with him, but there would soon be a series of events that would make John Kennedy a changed man. In 1961, the CIA and director Dulles circumvented JFK by launching a secret invasion of Cuba in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. It was only at the last moment did JFK discover the unfolding events in which he refused to provide air cover and the invasion failed on the beach. Kennedy fired Dulles and threatened to break the CIA into a thousand pieces. This even marked the beginning of the bifurcation between JFK and the elite because the CIA had become their errand boy. The elite and their mafia partners desperately wanted Cuba back under their control and JFK blocked their ambitions. The following year, as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK had another chance to redeem himself in the eyes of the elite and again he failed. It did not matter that JFK had averted WWIII, he failed to put boots on the ground in Cuba and again, the elite and their designs for Cuba were thwarted.</p>
<p><img alt="vietnam protestors" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/vietnam-protestors.jpg" width="275" height="184" />Simultaneous to the events in Cuba, JFK was dragging his feet on Vietnam. He was reluctantly continuing on the path of allowing combat advisers to continue to operate in South Vietnam.</p>
<p>Vietnam was potentially a huge cash cow to the establishment elite. Chrysler Corporation received 90% of all US defense contracts in 1963, mostly in a middleman capacity. Bell Helicopter and Chase Manhattan Bank would reap record profits from the Vietnam War. Unfortunately for the elite, JFK was growing more isolationist. He became a changed man following the Cuban Missile Crisis as this event shook him to his core. He feared putting the US in military situations that could result in another confrontation with the Soviets. In 1963, JFK had announced that he was bringing home all combat advisers in 1965. JFK and South Vietnamese President, Diem, agreed that America would never send ground troops to Vietnam. Diem and his brother were assassinated by the CIA and 21 days later, JFK was dead. Nine months following these assassinations, America sent 100,000 ground troops to South Vietnam following the now discredited Gulf of Tonkin incident and the elite bathed in their blood money.</p>
<p>JFK had been so shaken by the real possibility of WWIII, that he and the Soviet Premier were actually having discussions regarding the capping of nuclear arms production. The elite could not have any part of  this unprofitable course of action. There is no money to be made in peace especially if you are Martin Marietta (today known as Martin Lockheed). The establishment elite wanted to continue down the path arming America’s nuclear arsenal to the teeth. JFK had become a major impediment to profits in this regard.</p>
<h2>The Changed Man Takes Center Stage</h2>
<p>JFK, no doubt motivated by the fear of WWIII, was blocking Vietnam and was going to kill the cash cow of nuclear arms production. No doubt, JFK saw the establishment elite as the enemy of humanity. They were willing to take the country to war so that they could fatten their wallets.</p>
<p>JFK began to take action against the elite. He was taking away half of their unwarranted oil depletion allowance. JFK stuck a big stick in the eye of the Federal Reserve by printing over $4 billion dollars of silver backed money, thus threatening the stranglehold the Federal Reserve had enjoyed over the country for the past 50 years.</p>
<p>JFK began making speeches, very damning speeches, in which he called out the establishment elite and their “secret societies” and then JFK signed his death warrant with his American University speech in which he announced, among other things, a desire to pursue peace with the Soviets. Once again, there is no money in peace.</p>
<p>On behalf of “the greater good”, JFK had to be eliminated and he was. However, I have often wondered if JFK had survived, how would America have been changed.</p>
<h2>If JFK Had Lived</h2>
<p><img alt="jfk plot" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/jfk-plot.jpg" width="285" height="177" /><br />
If JFK had lived, so too, would have 58,000 Americans and untold millions of Vietnamese. If JFK had lived, we would not have spent two trillion dollars on nuclear arms. The money could have been spent, as JFK suggested, on education. America might not have become the hopelessly dumbed down nation that it has become. If JFK had lived the Federal Reserve would have eventually gone the way of the two previous central banks in the United States. The US Congress would have retaken the constitutional power of coining money, interest free money. America would have remained solvent.</p>
<p>If JFK had lived, he would have continued to confront the oil companies and today, we might have achieved energy independence and could be paying about a buck for a gallon if gas. Alaska would be the new Middle East and the petrodollar, which threatens to plunge us into a world war over Syria and Iran, would no longer be a problem. The world would be coming to the US for its energy needs and our economy would be booming.</p>
<p>If JFK had lived, the people would have had their true representative in the White House. The events in Cuba so changed John Kennedy, that he became a true Ron Paul in the last two years of his life. It was the last time, that anyone, outside the elite establishment, had anyone in top level government that cared for them.</p>
<p>The day that John Kennedy died, November 22, 1963, was the beginning of the end for America. These same forces, the interlocking directorates of the military industrial complex, the Federal Reserve, the major oil companies and the media that they control, continued to suck the life out of America to the point of where we stand today, a shell of our former country.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If in the last year of JFK’s presidency, he hadn’t offered such hope to the American people and to the future of the country, I would have lost interest in the life of JFK and his subsequent assassination a long time ago.</p>
<p>I falsely held out the hope that the 50th Anniversary of his death would rekindle a curiosity about who killed JFK and why and then subsequently link that knowledge into today’s America. This could have been the impetus for change in America. Alas, the elite controlled the narrative this fall with plethora of documentaries which lead away from the truth that there was a conspiracy to kill JFK. As a result, the country’s interest will continue to wane and with it, the belief that JFK was killed as a result of a conspiracy.</p>
<p>In 1993, 80% of the country believed that JFK was killed as the result of a conspiracy. With the rash of media propaganda, that number has reduced to 61%. The elite have weathered the storm and continue unabated on their journey towards sucking the life out of this country. They will continue to do so until there is nothing left and we are thrown onto the junk pile of history.</p>
<p>There will be no 51st anniversary recognition as the JFK researchers have approached their twilight. Soon the JFK assassination will carry the same weight as the assassination of McKinley. Who? That’s my point. The King is dead, long live the King.</p>
<p><img alt="jfk" src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/11/jfk.jpg" width="217" height="232" />On November 23rd, as we turn our collective eyes back on our future, we might want to begin to prepare for adaptation for there will be no great awakening because your future and your very lives are being threatened by forces that John Kennedy foresaw over 50 years ago in his “Secret Societies” speech.</p>

			<p>New York &#8211; Jeremy Hammond sat in New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center last week in a small room reserved for visits from attorneys. He was wearing an oversized prison jumpsuit. The brown hair of the lanky 6-footer fell over his ears, and he had a wispy beard. He spoke with the intensity and clarity one would expect from one of the nation’s most important political prisoners.</p>
<p>On Friday the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/jeremy-hammond-anonymous-hacker-guilty-stratfor_n_3347215.html">28-year-old activist</a> will appear for sentencing in the Southern District Court of New York in Manhattan. After having made a plea agreement, he faces the possibility of a 10-year sentence for hacking into the Texas-based private security firm Strategic Forecasting Inc., or Stratfor, which does work for the Homeland Security Department, the Marine Corps, the Defense Intelligence Agency and numerous corporations including Dow Chemical and Raytheon.</p>
<p>Four others involved in the hacking have been convicted in Britain, and they were sentenced to less time combined—the longest sentence was 32 months—than the potential 120-month sentence that lies before Hammond.</p>
<p>Hammond turned the pilfered information over to the website WikiLeaks and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-rise-and-fall-of-jeremy-hammond-enemy-of-the-state-20121207">Rolling Stone</a> and other publications. The 3 million email exchanges, once</p>

<p>made public, exposed the private security firm’s infiltration, monitoring and surveillance of protesters and dissidents, especially in the Occupy movement, on behalf of corporations and the national security state. And, perhaps most important, the information provided chilling evidence that anti-terrorism laws are being routinely used by the federal government to criminalize nonviolent, democratic dissent and falsely link dissidents to international terrorist organizations. Hammond sought no financial gain. He got none.The email exchanges Hammond made public were entered as evidence in <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_last_chance_to_stop_the_ndaa_20130902">my lawsuit</a>against President Barack Obama over Section 1021 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Section 1021 permits the military to seize citizens who are deemed by the state to be terrorists, strip them of due process and hold them indefinitely in military facilities. Alexa O’Brien, a content strategist and journalist who co-founded US Day of Rage, an organization created to reform the election process, was one of my co-plaintiffs. Stratfor officials attempted, we know because of the Hammond leaks, to falsely link her and her organization to Islamic radicals and websites as well as to jihadist ideology, putting her at risk of detention under the new law. Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled, in part because of the leak, that we plaintiffs had a credible fear, and she nullified the law, a decision that an appellate court overturned when the Obama administration appealed it.</p>
<p>Freedom of the press and legal protection for those who expose government abuses and lies have been obliterated by the corporate state. The resulting self-exile of investigative journalists such as <a href="http://www.advocate.com/print-issue/current-issue/2013/10/24/enemy-state">Glenn Greenwald</a>, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/jacob-appelbaum-utopia-interview">Jacob Appelbaum</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html">Laura Poitras</a>, along with the indictment of <a href="http://freebarrettbrown.org/">Barret Brown</a>, illustrate this. All acts of resistance—including nonviolent protest—have been conflated by the corporate state with terrorism. The mainstream, commercial press has been emasculated through the Obama administration’s repeated use of the Espionage Act to charge and sentence traditional whistle-blowers. Governmental officials with a conscience are too frightened to reach out to mainstream reporters, knowing that the authorities’ wholesale capturing and storing of electronic forms of communication make them easily identifiable.</p>
<p>Elected officials and the courts no longer impose restraint or practice oversight. The last line of defense lies with those such as Hammond, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning who are capable of burrowing into the records of the security and surveillance state and have the courage to pass them on to the public. But the price of resistance is high.</p>
<p>“In these times of secrecy and abuse of power there is only one solution—transparency,” wrote <a href="http://www.dw.de/sarah-harrison-ally-of-ex-nsa-contractor-snowden-in-germany/a-17211444">Sarah Harrison</a>, the British journalist who accompanied Snowden to Russia and who also has gone into exile, in Berlin. “If our governments are so compromised that they will not tell us the truth, then we must step forward to grasp it. Provided with the unequivocal proof of primary source documents people can fight back. If our governments will not give this information to us, then we must take it for ourselves.”</p>
<p>“When whistleblowers come forward we need to fight for them, so others will be encouraged,” she went on. “When they are gagged, we must be their voice. When they are hunted, we must be their shield. When they are locked away, we must free them. Giving us the truth is not a crime. This is our data, our information, our history. We must fight to own it. Courage is contagious.”</p>
<p>Hammond knows this contagion. He was living at home in Chicago in 2010 under a 7-a.m.-to-7-p.m. curfew for a variety of acts of civil disobedience when Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning was arrested for giving WikiLeaks secret information about military war crimes and government lies. Hammond at the time was running social aid programs to feed the hungry and send books to prisoners. He had, like Manning, displayed a remarkable aptitude for science, math and computer languages at a young age. He hacked into the computers at a local Apple store at 16. He hacked into the computer science department’s website at the University of Illinois-Chicago as a freshman, a prank that saw the university refuse to allow him to return for his sophomore year. He was an early backer of “cyber-liberation” and in 2004 started an “electronic-disobedience journal” he named Hack This Zine. He called on hackers in a speech at the 2004 DefCon convention in Las Vegas to use their skills to disrupt that year’s Republican National Convention. He was, by the time of his 2012 arrest, one of the shadowy stars of the hacktivist underground, dominated by groups such as Anonymous and WikiLeaks in which anonymity, stringent security and frequent changes of aliases alone ensured success and survival. Manning’s courage prompted Hammond to his own act of cyber civil disobedience, although he knew his chances of being caught were high.</p>
<p>“I saw what Chelsea Manning did,” Hammond said when we spoke last Wednesday, seated at a metal table. “Through her hacking she became a contender, a world changer. She took tremendous risks to show the ugly truth about war. I asked myself, if she could make that risk shouldn’t I make that risk? Wasn’t it wrong to sit comfortably by, working on the websites of Food Not Bombs, while I had the skills to do something similar? I too could make a difference. It was her courage that prompted me to act.”</p>
<p>Hammond—who has black-inked tattoos on each forearm, one the open-source movement’s symbol known as <a href="http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/">the “glider”</a> and the other <a href="http://www.iching123.com/7_text.htm">the shi hexagram</a> from the I Ching—is steeped in radical thought. As a teenager, he swiftly migrated politically from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party to the militancy of the <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/the_cancer_of_occupy_20120206">Black Bloc</a> anarchists. He was an avid reader in high school of material put out by <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/">CrimethInc</a>, an anarchist collective that publishes anarchist literature and manifestos. He has molded himself after old radicals such as Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman and black revolutionaries such as George Jackson, Elaine Brown and Assata Shakur, as well as members of the Weather Underground. He said that while he was in Chicago he made numerous trips to Waldheim Cemetery to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haymarket_Martyr's_Memorial.jpg">Haymarket Martyrs Monument</a>, which honors four anarchists who were hanged in 1887 and others who took part in the labor wars. On the 16-foot-high granite monument are the final words of one of the condemned men, August Spies. It reads: “The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voice you are throttling today.” Emma Goldman is buried nearby.</p>
<p>Hammond became well known to the government for a variety of acts of civil disobedience over the last decade. These ranged from painting anti-war graffiti on Chicago walls to protesting at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York to hacking into the right-wing website Protest Warrior, for which he was sentenced to two years in the Federal Correctional Institute at Greenville, Ill.</p>
<p>He said he is fighting as “an anarchist communist” against “centralized state authority” and “exploitative corporations.” His goal is to build “leaderless collectives based on free association, consensus, mutual aid, self-sufficiency and harmony with the environment.” It is essential, he said, that all of us work to cut our personal ties with capitalism and engage in “mass organizing of protests, strikes and boycotts.” Hacking and leaking, he said, are part of this resistance—“effective tools to reveal ugly truths of the system.”</p>
<p>Hammond spent months within the Occupy movement in Chicago. He embraced its “leaderless, non-hierarchical structures such as general assemblies and consensus, and occupying public spaces.” But he was highly critical of what he said were the “vague politics” in Occupy that allowed it to include followers of the libertarian Ron Paul, some in the tea party, as well as “reformist liberals and Democrats.” Hammond said he was not interested in any movement that “only wanted a ‘nicer’ form of capitalism and favored legal reforms, not revolution.” He remains rooted in the ethos of the Black Bloc.</p>
<p>“Being incarcerated has really opened my eyes to the reality of the criminal justice system,” he said, “that it is not a criminal justice system about public safety or rehabilitation, but reaping profits through mass incarceration. There are two kinds of justice—one for the rich and the powerful who get away with the big crimes, then for everyone else, especially people of color and the impoverished. There is no such thing as a fair trial. In over 80 percent of the cases people are pressured to plea out instead of exercising their right to trial, under the threat of lengthier sentences. I believe no satisfactory reforms are possible. We need to close all prisons and release everybody unconditionally.”</p>
<p>He said he hoped his act of resistance would encourage others, just as Manning’s courage had inspired him. He said activists should “know and accept the worst possible repercussion” before carrying out an action and should be “aware of mass counterintelligence/surveillance operations targeting our movements.” An informant posing as a comrade, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Xavier_Monsegur">Hector Xavier Monsegur</a>, known online as “Sabu,” turned Hammond and his co-defendants in to the FBI. Monsegur stored data retrieved by Hammond on an external server in New York. This tenuous New York connection allowed the government to try Hammond in New York for hacking from his home in Chicago into a private security firm based in Texas. New York is the center of the government’s probes into cyber-warfare; it is where federal authorities apparently wanted Hammond to be investigated and charged.</p>
<p>Hammond said he will continue to resist from within prison. A series of minor infractions, as well as testing positive with other prisoners on his tier for marijuana that had been smuggled into the facility, has resulted in his losing social visits for the next two years and spending “time in the box [solitary confinement].” He is allowed to see journalists, but my request to interview him took two months to be approved. He said prison involves “a lot of boredom.” He plays chess, teaches guitar and helps other prisoners study for their GED. When I saw him, he was working on the statement, a personal manifesto, that he will read in court this week.</p>
<p>He insisted he did not see himself as different from prisoners, especially poor prisoners of color, who are in for common crimes, especially drug-related crimes. He said most inmates are political prisoners, caged unjustly by a system of totalitarian capitalism that has snuffed out basic opportunities for democratic dissent and economic survival.</p>
<p>“The majority of people in prison did what they had to do to survive,” he said. “Most were poor. They got caught up in the war on drugs, which is how you make money if you are poor. The real reason they get locked in prison for so long is so corporations can continue to make big profits. It is not about justice. I do not draw distinctions between us.”</p>
<p>“Jail is essentially enduring harassment and dehumanizing conditions with frequent lockdowns and shakedowns,” he said. “You have to constantly fight for respect from the guards, sometimes getting yourself thrown in the box. However, I will not change the way I live because I am locked up. I will continue to be defiant, agitating and organizing whenever possible.”</p>
<p>He said resistance must be a way of life. He intends to return to community organizing when he is released, although he said he will work to stay out of prison. “The truth,” he said, “will always come out.” He cautioned activists to be hyper-vigilant and aware that “one mistake can be permanent.” But he added, “Don’t let paranoia or fear deter you from activism. Do the down thing!”</p>

				<p>October 28, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19033#respond" title="Comment on Government Attorneys Implicated In Ethics Scandal"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="19033 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19033">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/lawyer-ethics3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/lawyer-ethics2.jpg" align="left" /></a>A scandal is brewing in Chicago which threatens to make Operation Greylord look like a dress rehearsal for a cotillion. Starting with a seemingly innocuous question, tendered to press liaison Jim Grogan at the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC) in Illinois, a boil of corruption got inadvertently pricked, which threatens now to reveal a subterranean cancer in the legal system in Illinois.</p>
<p>For those who are unaware of Greylord, here is a bit of history: back in the eighties, a collaborative effort by the FBI, IRS and a couple of outraged judges and attorneys resulted in one of the biggest takedowns of public officials in the history of Illinois. At the end of the 3 1/2 year undercover operation, a total of 92 people were indicted, including 17 judges, 48 lawyers, ten deputy sheriffs, eight policemen, eight court officials, and state legislator James DeLeo.</p>
<p>The extent of the takedown might have mitigated further predatory acts by those in the legal system. Thirty years later, however, the corruption that was supposedly expunged by Greylord has simply become systemic.</p>
<p>Back to Jim Grogan. Grogan, who is an attorney as well as ARDC press liaison, declined to reply to questions from this reporter as to why no statements of economic interests could be found for the attorneys who work for the ARDC. The law governing economic interests reporting is in place to ensure that those working in government capacities are not being influenced by financial lures and temptations. These statements are mandated by 5 ILCS 420 to be filed every year for nearly everyone who works in a government capacity.</p>
<p>Here are relevant clauses from the law, with pivotal sections underlined:</p>
<div>
<img src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/1Phelan.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<div>
<img src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/2Phelan.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>When Grogan failed to respond to the query, Press Secretary Jim Tybor at the Illinois Supreme Court was contacted and astoundingly told this reporter that this law did not apply to the judicial branch. (See 6 and e, above).</p>
<p>Michelle Burton, a paralegal at the ARDC assured this reporter that the ARDC employees are not state employees. However, the website for the ARDC announces that the Commission is an arm of the Illinois Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The ARDC is in a particularly pivotal position. As the Commission responsible for disciplining attorneys, the ARDC functions as a gatekeeper. In that sense, the ARDC defines the legal climate in Illinois. Right now, the ARDC has taken upon its shoulders the regulation of an attorney’s right to free speech. Attorney Ken Ditkowsky, who has been practicing law in Chicago area since 1961, is facing disciplinary proceedings for sending emails to federal authorities asking for an investigation of corrupt practices in Illinois courts. </p>
<p>Shades of Greylord . . . Except this time, the feds are turning a deaf ear to evidence of legal malfeasance in Illinois. And Ditkowsky may in fact lose his license to practice law, due to his incisive perceptions and requests for investigation.</p>
<p>Attorney Ken Ditkowsky’s concerns about judicial and attorney misconduct began with the adult guardianship of Mary Sykes, an elderly woman who was placed under a guardianship without due process. Another Illinois attorney, JoAnne Denison, is also under disciplinary proceedings due to her maintaining a blog about the Sykes guardianship. (Source)</p>
<p>Ditkowsky soon realized that the phenomenon of what he is calling “elder cleansing” is going on nationwide. And for his act of speaking out against a pervasive assault on a vulnerable demographic group—the elderly and incapacitated—the ARDC has recommended a four year suspension of his license to practice law.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the ARDC attorneys appear to have quite a bit to hide in terms of their economic interests.</p>
<p>If you want to bribe someone, there are only a couple of ways to do this that would not trigger the red flags that are built into the banking infrastructure. One way would be to give someone a big envelope stuffed with cash. Brian Mulroney, a former Prime Minister of Canada, was caught red handed receiving such a bounty and a scandal ensued. (Source)</p>
<p>The other way is through a “loan.” The mechanism is simply and virtually opaque—Mr. X takes out a loan, such as a mortgage and Mr. Y pays it back. There are no banking flags to trigger and no embarrassing wads of cash, a la Mulroney, to explain.</p>
<p>The use of such property loans to funnel payola to judges was exposed in a 2009 article, which first appeared in the San Bernardino County Sentinel. Now it seems that those in the Illinois legal system, specifically attorneys at the ARDC, have climbed onto the dinero express.</p>
<p>Jerome Larkin, the Administrator of the ARDC and the individual who has signed the complaint against Ken Ditkowsky, has funneled several million dollars through his property in the last ten years. For example, Larkin took out a loan for $450,000 in December of 2001 and paid it back in exactly five years. In the meantime, he had taken out another $450,000 loan—in October of 2006, which he paid back in just a tad over four years, in January of 2011. In the meantime, he had taken out yet another mortgage—this one for $101,000—in November of 2009, which he was miraculously able to repay in just about a year.</p>
<p>But his unusual loan behavior doesn’t stop here. In January of 2011, Larkin took out a whopping $750,000 mortgage on the same piece of property. Larkin must have a direct line to lottery bucks, because he was able to repay this loan by January of 2013.</p>
<p>In the meantime . . . are you getting the picture yet? . . . he took out another $750,000 loan in December of 2012. </p>
<p>Neither Jerome Larkin nor his wife, psychologist Antoinette Krakowski responded to telephone inquiries concerning the amount of money being funneled through their home.</p>
<p>Larkin is the big cheese over at the ARDC. There are other attorneys in the employ of that powerful, shadowy, not-government, not private &#8211; commission whose loan history is also questionable, including attorneys Melissa Smart and Sharon Opryzcek.</p>
<p>Apparently, the word about the loan trough is getting out. A check was run on the loan history of attorneys and guardians ad litem, Adam Stern and Cynthia Farenga, whose actions first alerted Ken Ditkowsky to the predatory nature of probate guardianships. Lo and behold, Adam Stern’s loan history looks like that of a hyperactive kid in a Ritalin store.</p>
<p>A review of the Cook County recorder’s website reveals that Stern has run over a million dollars through his property loans in roughly the last ten years. A couple of examples of quickly repaid large loans taken out by Stern include a $272,000 mortgage taken out on 9/13/2004 and paid back on 2/17/05. Stern also took out a $51,000 mortgage on 9/13/04 and paid it back May of 2005. On October 4, 2004 Stern took out an $80,000 mortgage which he paid back less than three months later.</p>
<p>Adam Stern also has a federal tax lien on his home for $60,000. Stern, who is parenthetically serving as guardian ad litem in the Sykes guardianship and is thus in the responsible position of looking out for OPM—other people’s money—can’t even pay his own taxes.</p>
<div>
<img src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/3Phelan.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Attorney and guardian ad litem Cynthia Farenga’s loan history is similarly manic. Farenga is also a guardian ad litem in the Sykes case. For example, Farenga took out a $385,000 loan on 11/09/2006 and paid it off on 6/12/2007. A loan of over a half million dollars &#8211; $575,000 to be exact &#8211; was paid off by Farenga within five years, on 6/24/2013. Farenga took out a smaller, $244,000 mortgage on 10/16/2003 and paid it back within two years, on 9/28/05. In the meantime, she had taken out another mortgage, this time for an even $300,000 on 9/07/2005, which she quickly reconveyed in less than a year and a half, on 1/08/2007. All told, over two and a quarter million dollars have been funneled through Farenga’s property in the last ten years.</p>
<p>The head of a private investigator’s firm out in the Southern California area confided in me that judges were coming to him to inquire how to hide their property, so that public searches for these records would not result in transparency. Recently, Judge Ronald Christianson, formerly the Presiding Judge in San Bernardino County, changed the name on the records of his primary residence to “Property Owners.” Such tactics will make determinations of suspicious activity increasingly more difficult.</p>
<p>Ditkowsky has filed a complaint with the ARDC referencing the impropriety of Adam Stern working as a GAL when he has failed to fulfill his own tax liabilities. At the time of going to press, other records detailing suspicious financial activity by ARDC attorneys and others are being turned over to a Grand Jury.</p>
<p>The Director of the Administrative Office of the Illinois Supreme Court, Michael Tardy, did not respond to queries from this reporter concerning the economic interests and reporting requirements of the ARDC, which is an arm of the Illinois Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Are Americans ready to accept a police state? Are pastors and Christians ready to accept a police state? Are Republicans and conservatives ready to accept a police state? Are Democrats and liberals ready to accept a police state? Are there truly enough people left in this country who even understand what a police state is, and if they do, would they really support it?</p>
<p>I can hear many readers shouting, “No!” But I truly wonder just how many Americans have already accepted the police state in their hearts and minds. It is absolutely true that before despots and tyrants can put shackles around men’s necks, they must first put them around men’s hearts. So, just how many of the American people are walking around every day with shackles already around their hearts? How many pastors mount the pulpits with shackles around their hearts? How many teachers enter the classroom with shackles around their hearts? How many State lawmakers walk into their various capitols with shackles around their hearts? How many police officers get into their squad cars with shackles around their hearts? How many military personnel put on their uniforms with shackles around their hearts?</p>
<p>Those of us who are passionate about the freedom fight spend a lot of time discussing and debating the nuances of how best to protect liberty. Except for a precious few, our State governors, attorney generals, legislators, senators, mayors, county commissioners, city councilmen, etc., are doing a fantastically lousy job of honoring their oaths to the Constitution and to the principles contained in our Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights. Except for a precious few, our pastors, deacons, elders, and church leaders are doing a fantastically lousy job of defending freedom principles. Except for a precious few, our civic and business leaders are doing a fantastically lousy job of defending liberty. And needless to say, you could put the people on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., who are even doing diddly-squat about preserving liberty into an old-fashioned phone booth.</p>
<p>Republicans? Most of them have never seen a bill that expands the police state at home and foreign wars abroad that they did not absolutely love. Democrats? Most of them have never seen a bill that expanded government (any government) that they did not absolutely love. Yes, yes, I know that there are a few&#8211;a precious few&#8211;exceptions to the above, but not many.</p>
<p>But are the American people truly ready to accept a police state? A recent report at InfoWars.com is quite shocking to those of us who tend to believe that most of our fellow Americans would recoil at the thought of an open police state.</p>
<p>Reporting for InfoWars.com, Paul Joseph Watson writes, “After illustrating their enthusiasm for repealing the Bill of Rights, a video shows Americans happily signing a petition to support a ‘Nazi-style Orwellian police state,’ in what easily represents the most shocking footage of its kind to date.</p>
<p>“Citing issues with how the government shutdown has impacted the ability of the police to ‘keep the community safe,’ [Mark] Dice tells San Diegans that there is a need to ‘increase the Orwellian system.’</p>
<p>“‘Not a problem,’ responds one man as he signs the petition.</p>
<p>“‘We just want to model it after the Nazi Germany system to keep people safe and secure,’ Dice tells another individual.</p>
<p>“After signing the petition to ‘implement the Orwellian police state,’ another man responds, ‘You find the pot of money though,’ apparently more concerned about how much a Nazi-style police state would cost than its actual consequences.</p>
<p>“‘They’re trying to cut the budget by 20 per cent so we just want to make sure that we can model the police state after the Nazi Germany system,’ Dice tells another couple who sign the petition, before adding, ‘Thanks for supporting the police state.’</p>
<p>“‘We’re going to model it after the Nazi Germany-style police state,’ Dice clearly tells another man who signs the petition.</p>
<p>“‘We need this Orwellian-style system to keep everybody safe,’ Dice tells a woman as she is signing the petition, to which she responds, ‘Yeah.’”</p>
<p>See Watson’s report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infowars.com%2Famericans-sign-petition-to-support-nazi-style-orwellian-police-state%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFE7WKkBT9weJYLTOur4TzFnndsTA" target="_blank">Americans Sign Petition to Support “Nazi-Style Orwellian Police State”</a></p>
<p>So, how many of your friends, relatives, co-workers, neighbors, fellow club members, fellow pastors, and fellow church members would be willing to sign such a petition as mentioned above? Probably more than you would think. Why don’t you use Mark Dice’s technique and go stand with a petition on a street corner in your town or on a sidewalk outside the entrance of your church and find out? But be prepared for a shock. It is not just San Diegans that are already wearing the shackles around their hearts.</p>
<p>Those of us in the liberty movement are knocking our brains out trying to devise the best strategy to preserve the vestiges of freedom that are left in this country. The assaults against our liberties are ubiquitous&#8211;and so are the battlefronts upon which our fellow freedom-fighters are tirelessly and relentlessly defending the hill. Thank God for every one of them! I may or may not agree with each strategy or the people who come up with them, but if they are in the liberty fight, they are my brothers and compatriots.</p>
<p>But it is time for us to ask ourselves, are we living in a country in which a sizeable percentage of people do not care about, and may actually not WANT, liberty? Are we living in a country in which a sizeable percentage of people have already accepted the shackles of tyranny around their hearts?</p>
<p>I’m talking about Democrats and Republicans; Christians and unbelievers; pastors and pagans; liberals and conservatives; whites and blacks; educated and illiterate; rich and poor; men and women; northerners and southerners; easterners and westerners; military and civilians. How many are already wearing the shackles of tyranny around their hearts? I’m afraid far more than most of us want to admit.</p>
<p>At this point, I must make the following observation: if you are living in a State that does not recognize your right to keep and BEAR arms, if you live in a State that significantly impedes your right to possess and CARRY arms, if you live in a State that is unfriendly to the Second Amendment, you are living in a State in which a majority of lawmakers and citizens are already wearing the tyrant’s yoke around their hearts&#8211;and they want you to wear it, too.  And if you live in a large metropolitan city anywhere, you are living in one of liberty’s most inhospitable and hostile places. In all candor, one of the chief reasons why my family and I moved to a small town in a rural State (the Flathead Valley of Montana) is because of what I’m talking about right now.</p>
<p>For more information on our move to Montana, please go to this web page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchuckbaldwinlive.com%2FLinks%2FNewsLinks.aspx%3FCategory%3DBaldwins%25E2%2580%2599%2520Move%2520to%2520Montana&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9LgkjdkT5jEUfeTMrtc9rQTn_jQ" target="_blank">Baldwins’ Move To Montana</a></p>
<p>I realize that we have our share of big-government weenies here in Montana, too. I know we have a bunch of politicians and people who carry the shackles of tyranny around their hearts. I won’t argue that. But I also know that if police agencies in this area attempted a military lockdown such as took place in Boston after the marathon bombings, they would start a modern-day revolution. I KNOW that the majority of people in the Flathead Valley would never submit to such a police state. I also believe that the vast majority of law enforcement officers in this area would never attempt to enact such a police state.</p>
<p>As an example, according to published reports, the average home in the State of Montana has 27 firearms in it. Yes, you read it right: 27. I dare say that the average pickup truck in Montana has more guns in it than the average house in just about any other State.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Thomas Jefferson was right: big cities are the “bane” of freedom. And those states that are controlled by big cities are also a major culprit in the demise of liberty.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Boston’s Gun Bible (BGB) ranked the states in order of their recognition of the right to keep and bear arms. According to BGB, the freest states are:</p>
<p>1. Vermont<br />
2. Idaho and Kentucky (tie)<br />
3. Louisiana and Alaska (tie)<br />
4. Wyoming<br />
5. Montana</p>
<p>And, again, according to BGB, the least free states are:</p>
<p>1. New Jersey<br />
2. Illinois<br />
3. Hawaii<br />
4. Massachusetts<br />
5. New York</p>
<p>Now, I would personally argue BGB’s ranking of Montana as number 5 in the list of freest states&#8211;especially when it comes to the Second Amendment. Regardless, notice the absence of the dominance of big-cities within the list of freest states, contrasted with the obvious dominance of big-cities within the list of least free states. In the list of freest states, only Kentucky and Louisiana have a metro area with over one million population. And in the case of Vermont, Idaho, Alaska, Wyoming, and Montana, the State with the largest population is Idaho with just over 1.5 million&#8211;in the ENTIRE STATE. The conclusion should be obvious: big cities equal less freedom; rural states equal more freedom.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this divergence of philosophy and the willingness or unwillingness of people in big city states and rural states to either accept or reject tyranny is a boiling pot that at some point is going to spill over onto the eye of the stove. Notice that Mr. Dice’s petition was asked of people in one of America’s largest population centers: San Diego, California. Take that same petition to the streets of Kalispell, Montana; Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; or Wasilla, Alaska; and the response would be MUCH different.</p>
<p>I don’t believe tyranny will come to America all at once; it will come piecemeal, city by city, State by State, and region by region. And liberty will be preserved the same way.</p>
<p>So, are Americans ready to accept a police state? It all depends on where you live.</p>
<p>P.S. This weekend, selected cities across the country will be privileged to see the premiere screening of James Jaeger’s fantastic new movie, “MOLON LABE: How The Second Amendment Guarantees America’s Freedom.” The film features such notable freedomists as Pat Buchanan, Ron Paul, Larry Pratt, G. Edward Griffin, Alex Jones, and, yes, yours truly&#8211;along with several others. It is terrific film. The people of the Flathead Valley in Montana are fortunate to be able to attend this premiere showing at the Mountain Cinema 4 theaters in Whitefish, Montana, at 11am Mountain Time, this Saturday, October 26. If you live within driving distance, you are invited to attend this premiere screening. DVDs of the film will be available at the showing.</p>
<p>If you are not able to go see MOLON LABE this weekend and would like to order the DVD of this new film, you may do so NOW. Order the MOLON LABE DVD here:</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/SOFAgeneric3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/SOFAgeneric2.jpg" align="left" /></a>JoAnne Denison has made a very big mistake, it appears. Denison, who has been a licensed attorney in the State of Illinois for twenty seven years, has been writing about corruption in the courts.</p>
<p>That appears to be a career-killing No- No.</p>
<p>Denison first became concerned as to the hanky panky going on in State Probate courts via her involvement in the adult guardianship of Mary G. Sykes. Sykes was put under an adult guardianship, without apparent legal jurisdiction by the Cook County Court. Neither Mary Sykes nor her adult daughter, Gloria, were served with notice of the proceedings. The court- appointed guardians have subsequently isolated the elderly woman from family and friends for roughly four years.</p>
<p>This is sadly not unusual in guardianship/conservatorship cases. When a concerned family member or friend attempts to intervene in what is often abuse of the “protected person” by the court- appointed guardian, the protesting party often gets treated most severely by the court. Restraining orders are passed out in these cases like salt water taffy, and more often than not there is a lack of due process involved in the restraining order hearings.</p>
<p>Meaning, in lay terms, that the restrained person does not get a hearing. </p>
<p>There also appears to be questionable financial actions taken by the guardians, Adam Stern and Cynthia Farenga, in the Mary Sykes matter. Over a million dollars in gold coins have been unaccounted for by the guardians. Once again, this is&#8211; unfortunately&#8211; business as usual in probate court. While one of the primary functions of a guardian is to conserve the estate, many guardians tend to look at OPM&#8211;”Other People&#8217;s Money” as a free pass to whoopee it up on someone else&#8217;s dime. Guardians “forget” to do inventories, “lose” valuable artwork and antiques and in some cases “misplace” entire bank accounts.</p>
<p>Denison, however, found all this abuse and embezzlement to be&#8230;..inappropriate. She began a blog, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmarygsykes.com&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNHN7jFxDYrOyWsA51qXxIJUL9f7wg">marygsykes.com</a>, which has featured articles by attorneys, award-winning journalists and bloggers as well as her own commentary on what is happening on a widespread basis in probate courts across the country. She has faithfully posted the legal documents relevant to the Sykes case.</p>
<p>And for this public service, Denison may lose her license to practice law.</p>
<p>Going into the complaint, which was filed by Jerome Larkin of the Illinois Attorney Registration &#038; Disciplinary Commission (IARDC), one finds that Denison is being tried for exercising her right to informed free speech. Larkin cites a number of quotes from Denison on her blog as evidence of the following:</p>
<p>a) Making a statement which a lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge&#8230;..</p>
<p>b) conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation&#8230;.</p>
<p>c) conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice&#8230;</p>
<p>d) presenting, participating in presenting, or threatening to present criminal charges to obtain an advantage in a civil matter&#8230;.</p>
<p>e) conduct which tends to defeat the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute.</p>
<p>I happen to think that Mr. Larkin over extended himself when he constructed this list. I have personally been reading the marygsykes blog for some time and am unaware of JoAnne Denison making any false statements. I am aware, however, that her criticisms of the malfunction of justice in these proceedings could well be considered in the category of someone declaring that the Emperor is not wearing any clothes&#8230;.</p>
<p>In other words, JoAnne Denison speaks politically inconvenient truths.</p>
<p>The complaint details some of the posts by Ms. Denison concerning the failures of the court to honor Mary Sykes&#8217; constitutional rights as well as concerns about the dispensation of her funds. Here are a couple of the posts which Larkin found objectionable:</p>
<p><strong>A July 28,2012 blog entry entitled &#8220;My fax to Diane Saltoun, Executive Director<br />
at the Illinois Atty General,&#8221; stating:<br />
While the above case has a long, long history, much of which is<br />
documented on a blog to be found at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marygsykes.com&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNECKUOVA9Egto2lDsZ9aFoKHcwoPw">www.marygsykes.com</a>. the<br />
reality of the situation is that this probate proceeding boils down to<br />
garden variety theft, embezzlement, malpractice and mal feasance by<br />
attorneys and the court. ..<br />
Please look at the attached and all the information I will fax you<br />
shortly. This is a case that could be bigger than Greylord-what is<br />
being done to deprive grandma and grandpa of their civil rights and<br />
how the Probate court (routinely) operates.”</strong></p>
<p>Yep, them is fighting words, you can bet your booty on that. The fact that Ms. Denison&#8217;s post references concerns that have been brought to the attention of the court—a million missing dollars in gold coins, for starters&#8211;must have gotten Mr. Larkin all worked up. Because look at what else he has found objectionable in Ms. Denison&#8217;s blog:</p>
<p><strong>An April 19,2012 blog entry entitled &#8220;Ken Ditkowsky&#8217;s answer to the complaint<br />
filed against him by the ARDC via Cynthia Farenga,&#8221; wherein Respondent suggests<br />
that the GALs and the Guardian ad Litem stole Mary Sykes&#8217; money by stating:<br />
Kend (sic) Ditkowsky and I have been caught up in all of this because<br />
we have been working tirelessly on this blog and to inform others of<br />
this situation&#8211;and those attorneys who will churn fees at hundreds of<br />
dollars per hour-want us silenced. They apparently have a lot of clout<br />
in Probate and even with the ARDC &#8230;<br />
</strong><br />
Jumping Jehosophat!! You mean an attorney can now be cited for misconduct for reporting that a guardian and attorneys have committed embezzlement and are exercising what is commonly called &#8220;undue influence&#8221;? Isn&#8217;t that what courts and the media are supposed to do? Provide a forum (a public one, to remind the reading audience) wherein acts of criminal misconduct and corruption can be ferreted out?</p>
<p>Or was Larkin&#8217;s real concern that Denison discussed the clout that miscreant attorneys have with both the Court and his employer, the IARDC? Was Denison hitting too close to home for his comfort?</p>
<p>Attorney Ken Ditkowsky has also been subject to IARDC proceedings for his involvement in the Sykes case. Ditkowsky, who has been sending out emails to Attorney General Eric Holder and others, requesting an honest and complete investigation of the Sykes case, has been recommended for four years suspension from the practice of law. Ken Ditkowsky has been licensed to practice law since the early 1960&#8242;s.</p>
<p>The IARDC complaint against Ditkowsky references the attorney&#8217;s efforts to investigate the Sykes matter and also his efforts to represent Mary Sykes, as requested by Mary (the court had previously declined to appoint her counsel). In addition, the complaint also references statements Ditkowsky has made relating to the integrity and qualification of judicial officers.</p>
<p>Since the IARDC has recommended his suspension, Ditkowsky has continued to contact federal officials with his concerns about  the Sykes case. If anything, he has become louder and more insistent concerning the deprivation of rights inflicted upon Mary Sykes and others.</p>
<p>Ditkowsky is now referring to these cases as “elder cleansing,” a clear reference to what happened in another genocide, the first launched under Hitler, which cleansed Germany of hundreds of thousands of elderly and disabled ethnic Germans. Ditkowsky has also coined the phrase “ethics cleansing,” to refer to the removal from the Bar register attorneys who object to the abuses being administered via probate guardianships.</p>
<p>A letter from Guardian ad Litem Cynthia Farenga to the IARDC has since surfaced. In the letter, dated November 20, 2011, Farenga asks the IARDC for an investigation of Ditkowsky and Denison due to a blog post which appeared on Probate Sharks in 2011. In the blog post, Ditkowsky and Denison call for a State and Federal investigation of the Sykes case.</p>
<p>The Farenga letter confirms the very perception, memorialized on her blog, for which Denison is now under disciplinary proceedings. The fact that Farenga and others in the probate cabal do have torque with the ARDC should exonerate Denison from prosecution for saying so. But it has not.</p>
<p>It is of interest that the judge in the Sykes case, Judge Jane Louise Stuart, has deep financial ties to President Obama. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcitizenwells.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F04%2F21%2Fobama-mansion-rezko-william-miceli-probate-judge-jane-l-stuart-harvey-wineberg-kenneth-j-conner-fired%2F&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNGUOukef4ymtcB8ItUGxgk0dGqSTg">http://citizenwells.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/obama-mansion-rezko-william-miceli-probate-judge-jane-l-stuart-harvey-wineberg-kenneth-j-conner-fired/</a></p>
<p>Given that Ditkowsky has repeatedly emailed officers in the Obama administration concerning this case, one must ask if favors were requested by Stuart, who appears to own Obama&#8217;s mansion.</p>
<p>The website for the State of Illinois states that:</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.state.il.us%2Faging%2F2rules%2Frules-main.htm&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNHzV1wt_CURY9xCLMy4JnjBPAmnhw">Elder Abuse and Neglect Act</a> provides that people – who in good faith report suspected abuse or cooperate with an investigation – are immune from criminal or civil liability or professional disciplinary action. It further provides that the identity of the reporter shall not be disclosed except with the written permission of the reporter or by order of a court.</p>
<p>This should exonerate both Denison and Ditkowsky from disciplinary action for the reasons stated by the IARDC. Possibly the law does not apply when the judge is a financial supporter of President Obama.</p>
<p>In any event, the word is getting out: Ethical lawyering has gone the way of the Stegosaurus.</p>
<p>And the First Amendment? It doesn&#8217;t specify who has free speech and who does not. One more Constitutional protection is being thrown under the bus.</p>
<p>James Grogan, Deputy Director for the IARDC, declined to comment on whether the Elder Abuse and Neglect Act offered protection for Denison and Ditkowsky, stating he cannot comment on pending cases. When asked if, given the fact that the judge in question appears to own President Obama&#8217;s home, there might have been some federal directives issued in these two cases, Grogan also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Other lawyers who have been under the gun due to their attempted defense of conservatees include Grant Goodman, AZ; Margie Mikels, California; Jim Reiss, California.</p>

</div>
<p>On 28 November 1953, at 2 am, a man crashed through a closed window and fell to his death from the 10th floor of the Statler Hotel in New York City. He was identified as Frank Olson, a bacteriologist with the US Army Research Center at Fort Detrick, Maryland. He had fallen from a room he shared with another scientist, Robert Lashbrook. It was ruled a suicide.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years later, in 1975, William Colby, then CIA director, declassified documents that changed the complexion of the case. It was revealed that Olson had actually been an undercover CIA operative at Fort Detrick, and that one week prior to his death, he had been drinking Cointreau at a high-level meeting with scientists at Deep Creek Lodge in rural Maryland. The Cointreau was laced with a large dose of LSD administered by his CIA boss, Sidney Gottlieb. He was then sent to New York with Lashbrook, also with the CIA, to see a psychiatrist because the LSD had induced a psychosis.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that Olson had been part of the top secret CIA program that was known as Project MK-ULTRA, exploring the use of chemicals and <a title="PsyWar: A Short History of the Battle for the Mind" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/24/psywar-a-short-history-of-the-battle-for-the-mind/">drugs for purposes of mind control</a>, and bacteriological agents for covert assassination. Olson had been working on ways to deliver anthrax in aerosol form, for use as a weapon. New evidence that came to light, through the persistent efforts of Olson’s son Eric, made the suicide ruling highly suspect.</p>
<p>It turned out that Olson had been labelled a security risk by British intelligence after getting upset witnessing human experimentation on a trip to Frankfurt, Germany the previous summer. Eric Olson now believes that his father was drugged and then murdered to make sure that he didn’t reveal the secrets of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1441499733/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1441499733&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">MK-ULTRA project</a>. Following the 1975 revelations, the government must have felt more than a little guilt about the affair because Olson’s family was given a 17 minute audience with US President Ford, who apologised to them, and they were awarded damages in the amount of $750,000.</p>
<p><strong>Controlling Human Behaviour</strong></p>
<p>The MK-ULTRA program was instituted on 13 April 1953 by CIA Director Allen Dulles, ostensibly to counter the brainwashing techniques of American prisoners being held by the North Koreans during the Korean War, and to duplicate those techniques on enemy prisoners, i.e. the creation of “Manchurian Candidates.” This was the claim used to obtain funding for the project. However, the Prisoner of War brainwashing program was just the tip of the iceberg, and the CIA-sponsored experiments ventured far and wide into areas of Mind Control under the aegis of MK-ULTRA that had little or nothing to do with methods of interrogation.</p>
<p>The Colby revelations were part of a sweeping investigation of the CIA in January 1975 by the “Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States,” chaired by Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller. The subsequent June 1975 Report to the President said: “The drug program was part of a much larger CIA program to study possible means for controlling human behaviour. Other studies explored the effects of radiation, electric-shock, psychology, psychiatry, sociology and harassment substances.”</p>
<p>Even though the program got off to a rocky start with the Olson affair, it recovered quickly and became an umbrella project with 149 sub-projects. The overall guiding principal was succinctly stated in an internal CIA memo dated January 1952: “Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature such as self-preservation?”<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>The drug program came under the aegis of the Chemical Division of the Technical Services Staff headed up by Sidney Gottlieb from 1951 to 1956. Gottlieb was a highly intelligent eccentric who drank goat’s milk, enjoyed folk-dancing, and raised Christmas trees on his farm outside Washington.</p>
<p>The Agency funded <a title="Are Psychedelic Drugs the Next Frontier in Wellness Research?" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/09/26/can-lsd-help-cure-depression/">LSD research programs</a> at major medical centres and universities including Boston Psychopathic, Mt. Sinai Hospital at Columbia University, University of Illinois Medical School, University of Oklahoma and others. The funding was carried out secretly through the Josiah Macy Foundation, and the Geschickter Fund for Medical Research in Washington, D.C. The CIA claimed the secrecy was necessary to keep it from the Russians, but we have already seen that it was part of much larger project to <a title="The Illuminati: Renegades of the Mystery Schools" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/06/17/the-illuminati-renegades-of-the-mystery-schools/">learn how to control human behaviour</a> in general, so this is not credible.</p>
<p>Gottlieb told Dr. Harold Abramson at Mt. Sinai (who just happened to be the psychiatrist that Olson was supposed to see!) that he wanted “operationally pertinent materials [about]: a. Disturbance of Memory; b. Discrediting by Aberrant Behaviour; c. Alteration of Sex Patterns; d. Eliciting of Information; e. Suggestibility; f. Creation of Dependence.” That sounds like pretty deep stuff for the spy game. They were really afraid of public reaction and congressional condemnation, especially since the CIA charter did not allow domestic operations, and certainly prohibited experimentation on US citizens.</p>
<p>The callousness of the research is best exemplified by the CIA-funded work of Dr. Harris Isbell, the Director of the Addiction Research Center in Lexington, Kentucky. The drug addict hospital inmates, who were mostly black, were encouraged to volunteer for LSD research in return for hard drugs of their choice or time off their sentences. In most cases, they were given pure morphine or heroin. At one point Isbell kept seven men on LSD for 77 straight days. Many others were on it for up to 42 days.</p>
<p>Concerning extended LSD usage, John Marks in his landmark book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393307948/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0393307948&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind Control</em></a> says about writer Hunter S. Thompson (recently deceased) that he “frightened his readers with accounts of drug (LSD) binges lasting a few days, during which Thompson felt his brain boiling away in the sun, his nerves wrapping around enormous barbed wire forts, and his remaining faculties reduced to their reptilian antecedents.” The recent movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ISJQ1W/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B006ISJQ1W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>The Rum Diary</em></a>,<em> </em>starring Johnny Depp, based on the autobiographical book by Hunter S. Thompson, presents an imaginative re-enactment of his LSD adventures.</p>
<h3>The CIA Turns On the Counter-Culture</h3>
<p>Not satisfied with university research, Gottlieb recruited New York narcotics agent George White to distribute LSD surreptitiously to the “borderline underworld.” Operating through safe houses in Greenwich Village, Haight-Ashbury and Marin County, White gave doses to prostitutes, pimps, drug addicts and other “marginal people” and then observed the results and reported to Gottlieb.</p>
<p>John Marks says they were people “who would be powerless to seek any sort of revenge if they ever found out what the CIA had done to them. In addition to their being unlikely whistle-blowers, such people lived in a world where an unwitting dose of some drug… was an occupational hazard anyway.”</p>
<p>Eventually, White started using it randomly all over New York and San Francisco. Regarding the results, Marks says, “The MKULTRA scientists reaped little but disaster, mischief, and disappointment from their efforts to use LSD as a miracle weapon against the minds of their opponents.” Yet, they continued this program for 10 years until 1963.</p>
<p>Ironically, since the CIA had pretty much cornered the market on LSD internationally, buying up all the product of Sandoz and Eli Lilly, the spread of the drug to the counter-culture was through the Agency.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Timothy%20Leary&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Timothy Leary</a>, Ken Kesey, Allen Ginsburg and Tom Wolfe were first “turned on” thanks to the CIA, and that’s how the “flower children” became psychedelic.</p>
<p>But, the LSD experiments may have been more successful than Marks realised. They were carefully noting the precise effects on brain chemistry, and in the six areas that Gottlieb was concerned with: memory disturbance, aberrant behaviour, altered sexual patterns, eliciting information, suggestibility and creation of dependence. This became evident when they started using LSD as an adjunct in hypnotic and electronic experiments.</p>
<h3>Re-Patterning the Brain</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most notorious and nefarious MK-ULTRA sub-project was carried out at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada under the directorship of Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, an American from Albany, New York. Cameron had trained at the Royal Mental Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, under eugenicist Sir David Henderson, and founded the Canadian branch of the World Federation for Mental Health. At various times, he was elected president of the Canadian, American, and World psychiatric associations. In other words, Cameron was no renegade but had the full faith and endorsement of the world psychiatric establishment.</p>
<p>The CIA wanted Cameron to “depattern” the contents of the brain to make it receptive to new patterning. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=David%20Remnick&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">David Remnick</a> in a <em>Washington Post </em>article on 28 July 1985 said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The…. heart of the laboratory was the Grid Room…. The subject was strapped into a chair involuntarily, by force, his head bristling with electrodes and transducers. Any resistance was met with a paralysing dose of curare. The subject’s brainwaves were beamed to a nearby reception room crammed with voice analysers, a wire recorder and radio receivers cobbled together… The systematic annihilation or ‘depatterning’ of a subject’s mind and memory was accomplished with overdoses of LSD, barbiturate sleep for 65 days at a stretch and ECT shocks at 75 times the recommended dosage. Psychic driving, the repetition of a recorded message for 16 hours a day, programmed the empty mind. Fragile patients referred to Allan Memorial for help were thus turned into carbuncular jellyfish.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930852923/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0930852923&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Anton Chaitkin</a> in his essay, ‘British Psychiatry: From Eugenics to Assassination’, says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Patients lost all or part of their memories, and some lost the ability to control their bodily functions and to speak. At least one patient was reduced almost to a vegetable; then Cameron had the cognitive centres of her brain surgically cut apart, while keeping her alive. Some subjects were deposited permanently in institutions for the hopelessly insane.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA funded these horrors through a front called “The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology.” Other supporters of the Allan Institute were the Rockefeller Foundation, the Geschickter Foundation, and the Canadian government.</p>
<p>About Cameron’s work, Wikipedia says: “Naomi Klein states, in her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312427999/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312427999&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">The Shock Doctrine</a>,</em> that Cameron’s research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was actually not about mind control and brainwashing, but ‘to design a scientifically based system for extracting information from “resistant sources.” In other words, torture’. And citing a book from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Alfred%20W.%20McCoy&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank">Alfred W. McCoy</a> it further says that ‘Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Cameron’s experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb’s earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA’s two-stage psychological torture method’.” This method was codified in the infamous “KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation Manual” published by the CIA in July 1963, and in the <em>Human Resources Exploitation Training Manual – 1983 </em>that was used in CIA training courses in Latin American countries up until 1987. These manuals describe methods of psychological torture, far more potent than physical torture, to elicit information from “resistant sources.”</p>
<h3>An Orwellian Nightmare</h3>
<p>As one would expect, the technologies now available to the mind-controllers have zoomed off the chart to the point where George Orwell’s <a title="Is Privacy History? Top 5 Ways You Are Being Digitally Monitored and Catalogued Daily" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/12/11/is-privacy-history-top-5-ways-you-are-being-digitally-monitored-and-catalogued-daily/">world of omni-surveillance</a> now seems almost quaint. Of course, it is true that 1984 was 28 years ago. But even as far back as 1970, US congressman James Scheur was able to say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“As a result of spinoffs from medical, military aerospace and industrial research, we are now in the process of developing devices and products capable of controlling violent mobs without injury. We can tranquillise, impede, immobilise, harass, shock, upset, stupefy, nauseate, chill, temporarily blind, deafen or just plain scare the wits out of anyone the police have a proper need to control and restrain.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A brief survey of some of the scariest products known to be in the arsenal of the secretive alphabet agencies arrayed against John Q. Public are such devices as the Neurophone, patented by Dr. Patrick Flanagan in 1968. It converts sound to electrical impulses which can be delivered from satellites. When aimed at individuals, the impulses travel directly to the brain where the sounds are re-assembled and appear to be voices inside the head, which can be perceived as coming from God, or telepathic aliens, or whatever. Or the sounds can come out of a turned-off TV or radio. Through software, the device can mimic anyone’s voice and translate into any language.</p>
<p>It is believed that the CIA, DIA, NSA et al use the Neurophone to deliver threats and propaganda to selected targets, or just to torment someone they don’t like. One can imagine the possibilities. Could this explain some of the killings by “psychopaths” who say they were instructed by God, such as Mark David Chapman, David Berkowitz, or Sirhan Sirhan? If they had been previously evaluated through sophisticated personality assessments and groomed by LSD or hypnosis, such voices could easily tip the balance and convince them to kill.</p>
<p>We’ve all heard about the “Thought Police” and laughed because it seemed so implausible. Well, the joke is on us. <a title="Airport Scanners in 2014 – Fear and the End of Privacy" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/02/14/airport-scanners-in-2014-fear-and-the-end-of-privacy/">Brain scanning technology</a> is now well-advanced. In 1974, Lawrence Pinneo, a neurophysiologist and electronic engineer with the Stanford Research Institute succeeded in correlating brain wave patterns from EEGs with specific words. In 1994, the brain wave patterns of 40 subjects were officially correlated with both spoken words and silent thought at the University of Missouri. It is believed that US intelligence agencies now have a brain wave vocabulary of over 60,000 words in most common languages.</p>
<p>Brain waves constitute a magnetic field around the head (the aura), each person having a unique, identifiable electromagnetic signature which becomes visible through Kirlian photography, and these fields can be monitored by satellites. The translated results are then fed back to ground-side super computers at speeds of up to 20 gigabytes/second. Neurophone messages can then be beamed to selected individuals based on their thoughts. It is believed that about one million people around the globe are now monitored on a regular basis. As these numbers increase, as they certainly will, to include most educated and important people in the world, the <a title="Former Presidents Warn About the “Invisible Government” Running the United States" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/09/13/former-presidents-warn-about-the-invisible-government-running-united-states/">New World Order</a> will definitely have arrived.</p>
<p>As Australian writer Paul Baird has observed, “no-one will ever be able to even think about expressing an opinion contrary to those forced on us by the New World Order. There will literally be no intellectual property that cannot be stolen, no writing that cannot be censored, no thought that cannot be suppressed (by the most oppressive/invasive means).” Baird also claims that ex-military/intelligence whistle-blowers have reported that experiments in controlling voters with these techniques have been tried in several foreign countries. So much for democracy.</p>
<p>Other technologies, such as microwave bombardment to confuse and disorient field personnel, microchip implantation, silently delivered acoustical subliminal messages, widespread population control through psychiatric drugs, and extreme close-up satellite-based viewing able to read documents indoors, are all well-developed and in use by military and intelligence agencies. This doesn’t even address the monitoring of overt spoken and written material. Under Project ECHELON, the NSA monitors every call, fax, e-mail and computer data message in and out of the US, Canada and several other countries. Their computers then search for key words and phrases. Anything or anyone of interest draws the attention of agency operatives, who can then commence surveillance operations by the NSA or other intelligence agencies.</p>
<h3>Novel Capabilities</h3>
<p>We conclude with a chilling vision of the future from the US Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. It is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARTBL4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003ARTBL4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20" target="_blank"><em>New World Vistas of Air and Space Power for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Prior to the mid-21st century, there will be a virtual explosion of knowledge in the field of neuroscience. We will have achieved a clear understanding of how the human brain works, how it really controls the various functions of the body, and how it can be manipulated (both positively and negatively). One can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources, the output of which can be pulsed, shaped, and focused, that can couple with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscular movements, control emotions (and thus actions), produce sleep, transmit suggestions, interfere with both short-term and long-term memory, produce an experience set, and delete an experience set. This will open the door for the development of some novel capabilities that can be used in armed conflict, in terrorist/hostage situations, and in training…”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And based on the past clandestine abuses of MK-ULTRA reviewed above, one can predict with relative certainty that these capabilities will be used on civilians, with or without their knowledge or acquiescence, in the service of the New World Order.</p>

				<p>September 9, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18714#respond" title="Comment on Nobel Peace Prize Winner Obama About To Rain Bombs On Syria"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="18714 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18714">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/obamabomber3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/obamabomber2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Winston Churchill said, “Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force (religion) exists in the world.”</p>
<p>Barack Hussein Obama spent some of his early formative years in Muslim mosques in Africa and Indonesia with his adopted or possible stepfather, a man named Soetero.   Gathering evidence shows Barack Obama’s biological father to be Frank Marshal Davis and not the Kenyan Barack Obama, Sr.?  Davis proved to be a communist sympathizer and journalist who lived in the USA from 1905 to 1987.</p>
<p>After election, Barack Obama hired the most powerful cadre of lawyers to seal all his records from public view.   Thus, no one knows his birth place, his real father or his chosen religion.  His Social Security Card number definitely stems from fraud because the initial “247” prefix shows he received it from Connecticut, a state he never lived in or visited.  He never worked for any money, but enjoyed unlimited financial ability to attend Columbia and Harvard universities.</p>
<p>At some point, history will expose Barack Obama’s real father, his real birth certificate, his real Social Security number (fraudulent) and where he received the money to attend such expensive universities—no matter how much obfuscation, lies or cover-up.  Ironically, more and more evidence shows Obama never registered with his U.S. draft board.  But no top journalists or Main Stream Media outlets will investigate Obama’s numerous mysteries.  This video gives a clue—to Barack Obama’s real father:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6gVc9GbtW8" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr></wbr>v=o6gVc9GbtW8</a></p>
<p>After having done no verifiable work as a lawyer in Chicago, he jumped into a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois.   He voluntarily relinquished his law license in the State of Illinois because authorities breathed on him legally for some kind of lawless behavior on Obama’s part.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with a silvery tongue and no experience of any kind that would qualify him for becoming a U.S. president, Obama reached the White House.   Immediately, the guardians of the Nobel Peace Prize gave him the award as an “Affirmative Action” reward to anoint the first black U.S. President with the highest achievement for peace in the world.  However, Obama accomplished nothing to warrant it.</p>
<p>Right now, Obama harnesses his silvery tongue to “persuade” Congress to rain bombs and missiles down on Syria to stop Syrian dictator Assad from gassing more people when the Muslim rebels will commit even greater atrocities if they come into power.  Muslims annihilate any other religious people within their realm.  Again, as Churchill said, “…no greater retrograde force (religion) exists in the world.”</p>
<p>We know that Muslims kill gay people, arrange marriages for 12 year old girls to 40 year old men, force multiple wives, kill their wives and daughters for contrived rule-breaking via “honor killings”, throw acid in women’s faces to keep them terrified and compliant, cut off their noses as shown in a front page issue of Time Magazine over a year ago, and continue with the “retrograde” activity of female genital mutilation in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  That 6<sup>th</sup> century barbaric surgery, FGM, totally destroys a woman’s ability to enjoy intimate gratification of any kind.</p>
<p>As it stands, Obama hired eight hard-core Muslims who now counsel him in the White House as to what actions he should be taking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asst. Sec. for Policy Development for U.S. Department of Homeland Security Sarif Alikhan;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Homeland Security Advisor Mohammed Elibiary;</li>
<li>Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Conference, Rashad Hussian;</li>
<li>Obama’s advisor, founder of Muslim Public Affairs Council who is also its Executive Director, Salam al-Marayati;</li>
<li>Obama’s “Sharia Czar,” Islamic Society of North America, Imam Mohamed Magid;</li>
<li>Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel;</li>
<li>And newly converted to Islam, non-other than the Head of the CIA, John Brennan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Writer Nicholas Purpura said, “Despite the fact that this country was founded on religious freedom, it would be idiotic to argue the First Amendment <b><i>grants all religions the right to practice their faith</i></b>.  Those religions which would interfere with others, for certain and constitutionally, would not be granted such rights.  Here&#8217;s the problem, Islam decrees their followers hate, murder, and terrorize all people that refuse to submit and convert to Islam, with no exceptions. Therefore, it stands to reason Islam cannot coexist in any civilized nation which supports religious freedom. Case closed, as should be our borders to Muslims.”</p>
<p>Yet, no top journalists or Congress or the media will report on the underbelly of what Americans face if Obama starts a new war in Syria.</p>
<p>While George W. Bush may be proven one of the most incompetent presidents in history with his “Shock and Awe” and “Weapons of Mass Destruction” lie and invasion of Iraq, Barack H. Obama may take the trophy for the greatest con-artist ever to hit the American scene in the history of this country.</p>
<p>If he gets his way, and he wages war on Syria, he takes responsibility for thousands of deaths for America’s Nobel Peace Prize winner.  More war, more atrocities, more of what Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Afghanistan and Iraq represented: lies, death, destruction and the futility of war in the Muslim world.  Fact: Muslims represent the craziest, most barbaric and most war-like people in the world.  Every major terrorist activity since 1972 in the Olympics—pertains to Muslims.</p>
<p>Why do so few journalists see the inconsistencies and why aren’t the American people calling for impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama?  Why do we keep fighting wars in the lands of that “retrograde” religion that subjects its people to total subservience, illiteracy, loss of critical thinking, loss of personal freedom, loss of women’s rights, loss of choice and loss of free speech?  Why do we continue importing hundreds of thousands of Muslims into our country against all reason?</p>
<p>Congress and the president continue useless wars that raise our $16.5 trillion debt while they disregard schools, infrastructure and jobs for American citizens.  Have we lost our will to vote, speak and stand up for integrity, the rule of law and the U.S. Constitution?  Have we lost the will to maintain our sovereignty, culture, language and way of life?</p>

			<p>Something is wrong in this country, terribly wrong. Many children are going missing from Child Protective Custody supervision, all across this country, with no record of what has happened to the thousands of missing children.</p>
<h2>Oklahoma Is the Latest State to Tolerate Child Sex Slavery Rings</h2>
<p><img src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/08/oklahoma-missing-children.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<blockquote>In Oklahoma, Seventy-eight children have gone completely missing with no explanation. The most frightening aspect of this development is that these children went missing while in custody of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS).</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the Oklahoma media is asking questions. <a href="http://newsok.com/missing-78-children-from-oklahoma-department-of-human-services-custody/article/3871014/?page=1">Millie Carpenter</a>, who holds the position of DHS’s permanency and well-being program administrator, and her cohort, <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/08/13/child-sex-trafficking-and-the-oklahoma-state-government/Seventy-eight%20children%20in%20custody%20of%20the%20Oklahoma%20Department%20of%20Human%20Services%20are%20missing.">Melissa Jones</a>, a DHS program supervisor, insist that there is nothing wrong and their publicly funded agency has made absolutely no mistakes. No mistakes? There are 78 children, under their care who are missing! Nothing wrong?</p>
<p>Carpenter and Jones insist there is DHS accountability and that all 78 missing children should be considered to be runaways and that they have not been abducted. How would they know since the children are missing?</p>
<p>Please allow me to emphasize that these 78 children were under the custody and care of DHS at the time of their disappearance. If these children had disappeared while in the custody of their parents, wouldn’t there be hell to pay regarding parental accountability? Both the authorities and the media should be asking questions about supervision and agency accountability. When these children were not in their tax-supported bed at night, why was nothing done?</p>
<p>Presumably, many of these children were removed from their parents by Child Protective Services and placed in DHS custody because their parents were accused of neglect and/or abuse. Isn’t DHS responsible for room and board? Each child is required to accounted for with regard to state allocations for food and housing!  Therefore, can some responsible person of authority, connected to DHS, please explain to me why 78 missing person reports have not been filed? Why weren’t the police notified? If these children were removed from the parents home, then a court would have to be involved. As such, the courts should have been immediately notified when the children went missing because a court order was not being complied with.</p>
<p>If the missing 78 children in Oklahoma was just a case of gross dereliction of duty by officials such DHS administrators Carpenter and Jones, then we could fire the incompetent personnel and hire better people who would protect the children. But the fact that these children were not even reported as missing is inexcusable.</p>
<p>How do I know that something is terribly wrong? Simple, I used to be a mental health counselor and these types of administrative procedures were part of my training. The facts connected to the handling of these missing children does not add up. If the three stooges are not running Oklahoma’s DHS, then there is something very criminal going on. And the fact that the authorities are not up in arms and conducting a criminal investigation is highly suspicious and suggests further complicity at some official level. There is very good reason to expect a much deeper level of criminal activity related to these children because it has happened before.</p>
<h2>The Penn State Case</h2>
<p>The Oklahoma DHS scandal is nothing new. Agency or corporate controlled sex rings are hidden in plain sight. They often receive legitimacy from various government agencies and top corporate entities. Here is an example of how the child sex rings are hidden in the plain light of day.</p>
<p>Jerry Sandusky’s “The Second Mile Foundation”  was recognized as one of President Bush’s top “1000<a href="http://www.henrymakow.com/penn_state_scandal_is_bigger_t.html">Points of Light</a>.” Interestingly, Marvin P. Bush was on the National Collegiate Athletic Association Board of Directors which helped make the selection. Former president, George H. W. “Pappy” Bush is no stranger to accusations of pedophilia as evidenced by the accompany headline below this paragraph.</p>
<div><img src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/08/bush-molester.png" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Court records show that former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky molested dozens, if not hundreds of children from at 1977 to 2011 when this animal was finally caught, convicted and sentenced.</p>
<div><img src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/08/sandusky.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Most Americans think that when Sandusky, received a 30 to 60 prison term after being found guilty on 45 counts of the sexual exploitation of minors, that the case was closed.  And that is what the child sex trafficking industry and their allies in the corporate controlled media would have the public believe.</p>
<p>In actuality, the Sandusky case was quickly concluded in order to prevent any investigation from going forth which would reveal the extent to which pedophilia, for fun and profit, have ensnared the rich and famous powerful elite, both in this country and abroad.</p>
<p>Records show that Sandusky should have been convicted of child molestation in 1999 when allegations against him were first made. This particular incident was investigated by local police, referred to Centre County’s District Attorney, Ray Gricar, who refused to press charges despite the fact that the mother of the alleged victim had voicemail tapes and tape recordings of Sandusky and her son and their sexually explicit conversations. Friends of Gricar have said that he was frightened and was intimidated in not pursing charges despite overwhelming evidence. However, at a later time, Gricar developed some intestinal fortitude and reopened his investigation into Sandusky’s illicit conduct. Shortly thereafter, on his day off, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2060027/Ray-Gricar-disappeared-2005-tried-bring-sex-abuse-case-Penn-States-Jerry-Sandusky.html">Gricar went missing</a> and has body has never been found. His laptop was found in a nearby creek, but none of the data could be retrieved according to the FBI investigative report. Gricar was declared legally dead in 2011, after the Sandusky scandal surfaced. The investigation of the apparent kidnapping and murder of Ray Gricar could politely be described as incomplete. Gricar’s fate is an all too common fate experienced by whistle blowers and investigators into the world-wide pedophile ring.</p>
<p>We now know that Sandusky obtained many of his victims from his precious Second Mile Foundation. How could the board members of The Second Mile Foundation expect a naive public that from 1977 to 2011, that absolutely no Second Mile official, nobody at all, except for the abused children and Sandusky, had any knowledge of the abuse? Keep in mind that these young victims were pimped out in broad daylight as revealed in the court testimony. The Second Mile Foundation board members have associations which reach into the highest pinnacles of power in this country including Richard Struthers of Bank of America, Michael O’Donnell, Jake Corman Pennsylvania State Senator. Vice President of Morgan Stanley and Matt Millen an ESPN football analyst. In Additionally, many of the Penn State donors have intimate connections to both Second Mile and some of the top politicians in this country. And for 34 years, nobody at Second Mile knew? Well, District Attorney Ray Gricar knew and he’s dead.</p>

<h2>Where Is Nancy Schaefer When We Need Her?</h2>
<div><img src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/08/nancy-schaefer.jpg" alt="" /></p>
</div>
<p>Former Georgia State Senator, Nancy Schaefer was an outspoken opponent of Child Protective Services (CPS). Schaefer authored an <a href="http://fightcps.com/pdf/TheCorruptBusinessOfChildProtectiveServices.pdf">investigation</a> in which, among other findings, revealed the following:</p>
<p><i>“…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets.</i></p>
<p><i>The Adoption and the Safe Families Act, set in motion by President Bill Clinton,  offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a <b>$4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child.</b> Employees work to keep the federal dollars flowing.</i></p>
<p><i>The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1998 reported that six times as many children died in foster care than in the general public and that once removed to official “safety”, these children are far more likely to suffer abuse, <b>including sexual molestation than in the general population.</b></i><b></b></p>
<p "><i>That according to the California Little Hoover Commission Report in 2003, 30% to 70% of the children in California group homes do not belong there and should not have been removed from their homes.</i></p>
<p><i>…poor parents often times are targeted to lose their children because they do not have the where-with-all to hire lawyers and fight the system. Being poor does not mean you are not a good parent or that you do not love your child, or that your child should be removed and placed with strangers.”</i></p>
<p>In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as The Second Mile, procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.</p>
<p>As most of us know, Nancy Schaefer and her husband Bruce were “suicided” in 2010, on the same day she was attempting to reach out to talk show host, Alex Jones, because she knew she was in deep trouble.</p>

<em>Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney</em></p>
</div>
<p>And of course, there is the omnipresent DynCorp child sex trafficking scandal. On March 11th 2005, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney grilled Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers on the DynCorp child sex trafficking case. “Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver a <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2006/010106sexslavescandal.htm">moving</a> speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade. The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business. But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children. While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox and anthrax vaccines, and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program. Mr. Secretary, is it the policy of the U.S. Government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?” Rumsfeld fumbled around and blamed a single employee of DynCorp for these transgressions and DynCorp, at that time, continued to receive government contracts.</p>
<p>McKinney was subsequently driven from office. Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is one of very few government officials in high office aside from Cynthia McKinney to <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Governor_writes_Rumsfeld_on_human_trafficking_1230.html"><strong>demand answers</strong></a> on this issue. And what may you ask happened to Blagojevich? He was framed for trying to sell Obama’s senatorial seat in a story that made no sense. Does this tell us how high up the corruption goes?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The missing 78 Oklahoma children provides the American people with an opportunity to blow the lid off of this conspiracy once and for all. How many of these children are dead? How many were forced into child sex-slavery rings? Or, as Oklahoma’s DHS claims, are these children simply “run away” children?</p>
<p>America, we have an important decision to make. Are we going to press for answers. Will we demand that heads roll in Oklahoma and launch an all out search for the missing 78 children?</p>
<p>If we will not rise up as a nation to protect our children, our most precious asset, then we do not deserve to survive as a nation.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/greenspanmafia3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/greenspanmafia2.jpg" align="left" /></a>In government, failure is success. That’s what I call DiLorenzo’s First Law of Government. When the welfare state bureaucracy fails to reduce poverty, it is rewarded with more tax dollars and more responsibilities. When the government schools fail to educate children, they are rewarded with more tax dollars and more power to meddle in education. When NASA blows up a space shuttle, it is rewarded with a large budget increase (unlike a private airline which would probably go bankrupt). And when the Fed caused the worst depression since the Great Depression in 2007, it was rewarded with a vast expansion of its powers.</p>
<p>DiLorenzo’s Second Law of Government is that politicians will rarely, if ever, assume responsibility for any of the problems that they cause with bad policies. No one group in society is more irresponsible than politicians. There are a few exceptions, but in general they will always blame capitalism for our economic problems even when capitalism is not even the economic system that we live under (economic fascism or crony capitalism would be more accurate). Nothing is more irresponsible than knowingly destroying what’s left of our engine of economic growth with more and more governmental central planning, even if it is given the laughable name of “public interest regulation.”</p>
<p>DiLorenzo’s Third Law of Government is that, with few exceptions, politicians are habitual liars. The so-called “watchdog media” is more appropriately labeled the “lapdog media,” for pointing out the lies of politicians is the best way to end one’s career as a journalist. Do this, and your sources of information will cut you off.</p>
<p>One of the biggest governmental lies is that financial markets are unregulated and in dire need of more central planning by government. Laissez-faire is said to have caused the “Great Recession.” Fed bureaucrats have lobbied for some kind of Super Regulatory Authority to supposedly remedy this problem. This is all a lie because according to one of the Fed’s own publications (“The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions”), the Fed already has “supervisory and regulatory authority” over the following <em>partial</em> list of activities: bank holding companies, state-chartered banks, foreign branches of member banks, edge and agreement corporations, U.S. state-licensed bank branches, agencies and representative offices of foreign banks, nonbanking activities of foreign banks, national banks, savings banks, nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, thrift holding companies, financial reporting procedures of banks, accounting policies of banks, business “continuity” in case of economic emergencies, consumer protection laws, securities dealings of banks, information technology used by banks, foreign investment by banks, foreign lending by banks, branch banking, bank mergers and acquisitions, who may own a bank, capital “adequacy standards,” extensions of credit for the purchase of securities, equal opportunity lending, mortgage disclosure information, reserve requirements, electronic funds transfers, interbank liabilities, Community Reinvestment Act sub-prime lending “demands,” all international banking operations, consumer leasing, privacy of consumer financial information, payments on demand deposits, “fair credit” reporting, transactions between member banks and their affiliates, truth in lending, and truth in savings.</p>
<p>In addition, the Fed also engages in legalized price fixing of interest rates and creates price inflation and boom-and-bust cycles with its “open market operations.” In addition, financial markets are just as heavily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, and dozens of state government regulatory agencies. All of this is the Washington, D.C. definition of “laissez-faire” in financial markets.</p>
<p>DiLorenzo’s Fourth Law of Government is that politicians will only take the advice of their legions of academic advisors if the advice promises to increase the state’s power, wealth, and influence even if the politicians know that the advice is bad for the rest of society. The academics happily play along with this corrupt game because it also increases their notoriety and wealth. A glaring example of this phenomenon is the fact that, in the aftermath of the onset of the “Great Recession” there was almost no discussion at all by government officials, the media, or op-ed writers about the vast literature of economics that documents the gross failures of government regulation over the past century to promote “the public interest.”</p>
<p>There has always been some kind of government regulation of economic activity in America, but the federal regulatory state got its first big boost with an 1877 Supreme Court case known as <em>Munn v. Illinois</em>. The two Munn brothers owned a grain storage business and the powerful farm lobby in their state wanted to essentially steal their property by having the state legislature impose price ceilings on grain storage. Such laws had previously been ruled unconstitutional as a violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. But the plunder-seeking farmers prevailed, and it was hailed by statists everywhere as a victory for “the public interest.” Thus, the very first major example of “public interest regulation” was unequivocally an act of legal plunder that benefited a very narrow special interest at the expense of the public, which would have benefited more from a free market.</p>
<p>Either because of ignorance or corruption (or both), the statist academics of the time sang the “public interest” tune with regards to regulation, creating the myth that markets always “fail” and that the remedy is benevolent and wise government regulation in the public interest. The academics did this despite the fact that there was glaring evidence all around them that regulation was always and everywhere a special-interest phenomenon, as indeed almost all governmental activity is.</p>
<p>As historian Gabriel Kolko wrote in his 1963 book, <em>The Triumph of Conservatism</em>, big business in the early twentieth century sought government regulation because the regulation “was invariably controlled by leaders of the regulated industry, and directed toward ends they deemed acceptable or desirable.” Government regulation has generally served to further the very economic interests that are being regulated. Chicago School economists labeled this phenomenon the “capture theory of regulation.”</p>
<p>Most academic economists, seduced by the prestige, employment, and money that came from being governmental advisors, ignored all of this reality and instead spent roughly fifty years—from the pre-World War I years to the 1960s—inventing myriad factually empty<em>theories</em> of “market failure.” A popular book at the time was entitled <em>Anatomy of Market Failure</em>, by Francis Bator. This literature was (and is) based on the fraudulent technique of comparing real-world markets to an unobtainable, theoretical, Utopian ideal (“perfect competition”) and then condemning the real world for being “imperfect,” all the while<em>assuming</em> that the politics of government regulation would perfectly “correct” these imperfections. Economist Harold Demsetz labeled this charade “the Nirvana Fallacy.” Comparing real-world markets to “Nirvana” will always cause one to conclude that markets are “imperfect” by comparison. The market failure theorists never once compared government to Nirvana to subject interventionism to the same criteria. The Austrian School of economics is the only school of thought within the economics profession that never participated in this farce.</p>
<p>To its credit, the Chicago School of economics joined with the Austrians in exposing many of the market failure/regulation—is-always-good fallacies. Hundreds of journal articles and books were published that rediscovered the old truth that “as a rule, regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit,” as Nobel laureate George Stigler wrote in 1971.</p>
<p>This kind of research was expanded over the years to show that large corporations often support and lobby for onerous government “safety” and environmental regulations because they understand that the regulations will be so costly to enforce that they will likely bankrupt their smaller competitors while deterring others from entering the market in the first place. Businesses long ago discovered that the only way to have a long-lasting cartel is to have the cartel agreement enforced by the government. Privately-enforced cartels always break down because of cheating by the cartel members. The railroad and trucking industries were cartelized by the federal Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for many decades, for example. The ICC set monopolistic prices in these industries and prohibited genuine competition. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) cartelized the airline industry by prohibiting price competition until it was deregulated in the late 1970s. There was vigorous competition in the electric power industry in the U.S. until it was ended by government regulation in the early twentieth century by the creation of monopoly franchises by state and local governments. AT&amp;T enjoyed a government-sanctioned monopoly for many decades as well.</p>
<p>During the period of history when government-sanctioned monopoly was increasingly the norm, the Fed was created to facilitate the creation of a banking industry cartel. As Murray Rothbard wrote in <em>A History of Money and Banking in the United States</em>,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>the financial elites of this country … were responsible for putting through the Federal Reserve System, as a govemmentally created and sanctioned cartel device to enable the nation’s banks to inflate the money supply … without suffering quick retribution from depositors or note holders demanding cash.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, giving the Fed more regulatory authority is not unlike giving an alcoholic another bottle of whisky, a murderer another gun, or a bank robber a ski mask. It is bound to make things worse, not better.</p>
