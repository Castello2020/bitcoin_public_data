<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>Somewhere along the line I had suggested the name Crazy Horse after the great Indian chief and the guys liked it. Neil Young with Crazy Horse. Not ‘and’…I liked that I was with them. Like we were together, not separate.</strong></p>

<p>Because this American cannot improve on this Letter to Neil Young from the Palestinian Students’ Campaign for the Academic Boycott of Israel University Teachers’ Association it follows in full here:</p>
<p>16.03.2014</p>
<p>Besieged Gaza, Palestine</p>
<p>Dear Neil</p>
<p>We are Palestinian students and youth from the besieged Gaza Strip; we write to you now on a night engulfed by huge explosions ripping through our houses and neighborhoods again, more common than the thunder and hard rain also filling the night air.</p>
<p>And now we hear you plan on playing your inspiring music to a packed house in Hayarkon Park, Tel Aviv, a park built on the ruins of the Palestinian village Al Mirr, a land and people, destroyed and buried amidst unspeakable violence, but not forgotten. The residents of that Palestinian village and hundreds of other villages forcibly emptied by the nascent Israeli army, were either killed or denied return, denied the chance to even visit or commemorate the lives they once had. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
<p>While the world turns its back, we hope that you don’t turn yours, that you heed the call of over 170 Palestinian civil society organizations, for boycott, divestment and sanctions against the Israeli regime until it abides by international law and stops denying us the right to live as any other human beings would expect.</p>
<p>Just as you didn’t perform in Apartheid South Africa, just as you stood up against racism in the US South, just as you have so admirably supported indigenous rights in Canada against the drilling for Tar Sands, we ask you to support indigenous, displaced people wherever they may be, including we Palestinians. The words of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association in their recent move to boycott the Israeli regime echo the struggle for indigenous rights in America. <sup>(2)</sup></p>
<p>As this letter is penned the sound of more Israeli bombing reverberates around the tight refugee camps and narrow alleys where we live.</p>
<p>The camps are in complete darkness as the electricity has been cut.</p>
<p>The Israeli siege and previous bombing of our only power-plant has lead to huge fuel shortages, leaving us with just 6 hours of electricity each day.</p>
<p>This is just one night, but it is comparable to many other nights in Gaza, many worse nights.</p>
<p>We are used to facing the wrath of Israeli Merkhava tanks, drones, shellings, bombs and snipers that have brutally murdered and maimed our people for decades, for the crime of being born Palestinians, the wrong “ethnic group” for the Israeli regime who since it was established has done everything to wipe us off the map.</p>
<p>Listening to music is difficult in these circumstances, despite our passion for it. We have our own big range of music we love to play and Debka dance. But we have few instruments. Israel’s air, land and sea blockade of all our borders has meant for years musical instruments were banned from entry to Gaza.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>Other items denied to us were coriander, nutmeg, ginger, dried fruit, fresh meat, lentils, pasta, chocolate, fishing rods, cattle, toys, donkey, workbooks and newspapers. Dov Weisglass, an advisor to former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, explicitly outlined their intentions to collectively punish our population, “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger”, he announced, in contravention of article 33 of the Geneva Conventions and condemned by all major human rights organizations. <sup>(4]</sup></p>
<p>The violence behind Israel’s military occupation of our land is relentless and this week is no different. It began with Israeli border police shooting and killing a 38 year old Palestinian judge Raed Zeitar, the other bus passengers forced to sit and watch as he bled to death. Then 18-year-old Saji Darwish, Humanities student at Birzeit university, was shot in the head in Beitin, near Ramallah. Thousands attended his funeral the following day.</p>
<p>Tuesday saw four more murdered in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Israeli authorities approved the construction of 387 housing units in the illegal settlement of Ramat Shlomo, denying the Palestinian towns of Beit Hanina and Shuafat the possibility to expand. And today a three-month old baby Ahmed Ammar Abu Nahal died of enlarged heart and liver as a result of the closure of Gaza crossings, a closure that has also left our hospitals bereft of medical supplies.</p>
<p>And right now we sit paralyzed in our homes as the bombs fall on us in Gaza.</p>
<p>Who knows when the current attacks will end.</p>
<p>Permanently etched on our minds are the rivers of blood that ran through the Gaza streets when for over 3 weeks in 2009 over 1400 were killed including over 330 children, with white phosphorous and other chemical weapons used in civilian areas and contaminating our land with a rise in cancers as a result.</p>
<p>More recently 170 more were killed in the weeklong attacks in late November 2012.</p>
<p>How many more sleeping in their beds now will face the same fate in the coming days, weeks and months? The trauma, fear and uncertainty never goes away.</p>
<p>Over two thirds of the Palestinians here in Gaza are UN registered refugees.</p>
<p>Over half of us are children.</p>
<p>We or our descendants were dispossessed entirely and forcibly removed from our homes.</p>
<p>The extent of this ethnic cleansing was such that one in three refugees worldwide is a Palestinian.</p>
<p>Expulsions of Palestinians continue today especially in Jerusalem and the West Bank, places that we in Gaza are no longer able to visit.</p>
<p>For what crime? The crime of being born Palestinian.</p>
<p>The Israeli regime denies us the freedom to come to enjoy your music, we live our lives surrounded by Navy Gunships along the sea, jeeps and wall tower snipers along the land frontier, and skies filled with the kind of aircraft unleashing yet more devastating attacks tonight.</p>
<p>The Gaza Strip has been made an outdoor prison, a reality beyond which most youth can never imagine, because most can never leave.</p>
<p>Others are hearing us and the world is beginning to wake up.</p>
<p>Many of your contemporaries are taking a stand including Carlos Santana, Roger Waters, Annie Lennox, Elvis Costello and the late, great Pete Seeger and Gil Scott Heron, who said he wouldn’t play in Israel “until everyone is welcome there”. <sup>(5)</sup></p>
<p>As Israeli Apartheid week kicked off in South Africa this week, an event that has taken place in over 150 different locations worldwide, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for the world to support the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions of Israel, just as many other Anti Apartheid heroes from South Africa have affirmed. Tutu said in his statement on Monday, “I have witnessed the systemic humiliation of Palestinian men, women and children by members of the Israeli security forces. Their humiliation is familiar to all black South Africans who were corralled and harassed and insulted and assaulted by the security forces of the apartheid government.” <sup>(6)</sup></p>
<p>Long before he died, Nelson Mandela demanded that we should have the self determination of any other people. “We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians”, he said.</p>
<p>Will you sing “living with war” to an audience most of which will have served or are serving in the Israeli army that during the day were bombing our families, or manning the hundreds of checkpoints that make simple journeys daily acts of humiliation?</p>
<p>While we in Gaza can never return to our homes that lay buried around the areas in which you will be travelling freely, will you sing, “A hundred voices from a hundred lands, need someone to listen.  People are dying here and there.”</p>
<p>On the struggle to support First Nations rights in Canada and environmental protection <strong>you said: “If you have a conscience, you can`t go through your day without realizing what`s going on, and questioning it, and going, “Is this right?”</strong><sup>(7)</sup></p>
<p>This is the question to mull over as here in Gaza a short period of silence has descended after the bombs rained down on us yet again tonight Show the courage to say that this system of violent discrimination and racial segregation is unacceptable in Palestine, just as you showed it to be unacceptable in the American South, unacceptable in Apartheid South Africa and unacceptable for the Indigenous of the Americas.</p>
<p>Stand on the right side of history and stand with us, and don’t entertain apartheid Israel this July.</p>

<p>Commenting recently on the Elliot Rodger killings, arch-leftist Michael Moore <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/posts/10152065762191857?fref=nf" target="_blank">wrote</a> that while “other countries have more violent pasts…more guns per capita in their homes…and the kids in most other countries watch the same violent movies and play the same violent video games that our kids play, no one even comes close to killing as many of its own citizens on a daily basis as we do….” From a man who used to take the simple-minded gun-control position “fewer guns=less homicide,” it was surprising evidence of growth. After making his point, however, Moore made a mistake in following up with, “and yet we don&#8217;t seem to want to ask ourselves this simple question: &#8220;Why us? What is it about US?” It’s not, however, that we don’t want to ask the question.</p>
<p>It’s that we don’t want to hear the answer.</p>
<p>We can begin seeking it by asking another question: Why is it that Vermont, with approximately the same rate of gun ownership as Louisiana, has less than one-eighth the murder rate? Even more strikingly, why does New Hampshire have both a far higher gun ownership rate <em>and</em> a lower murder rate than England, Piers Morgan’s favorite poster-boy nation for gun control?</p>
<p>Professor Thomas Sowell provided more of these seeming contradictions in 2012, <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/gun-381016-control-murder.html" target="_blank">writing</a>:</p>
<p>When it comes to the rate of gun ownership, that is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, but the murder rate is higher in urban areas. The rate of gun ownership is higher among whites than among blacks, but the murder rate is higher among blacks.</p>
<p>… [There are also] countries with stronger gun control laws than the United States, such as Russia, Brazil and Mexico. All of these countries have higher murder rates than the United States.</p>
<p>You could compare other sets of countries and get similar results. Gun ownership has been three times as high in Switzerland as in Germany, but the Swiss have had lower murder rates. Other countries with high rates of gun ownership and low murder rates include Israel, New Zealand, and Finland.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer we don’t want to hear? The critical difference among these regions and nations is explained right in Sowell’s title: it’s “not guns.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s people.”</p>
<p>What “people” differences are relevant? Let’s start with race and ethnicity. In the cases of homicide in 2012 in which the races of the perpetrators were known, 55 percent were <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2012.xls" target="_blank">committed</a> by blacks, 62 percent of whom were under 30 years of age. Black youths are 16 percent of the youth population, but constitute 52 percent of those arrested for juvenile violent crime.</p>
<p>The statistics for Hispanics are more difficult to ferret out because, unbeknownst to many, law enforcement agencies tend to lump them in with whites in crime statistics (the FBI has <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2013/06/28/fbi-to-categorize-latinos-in-crime-statistics/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it will finally categorize Hispanic crime — in its report on 2013). However, there is some information available. Examiner’s Ken LaRive <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/federal-statistics-of-black-on-white-violence-with-links-and-mathematical-extrapolation-formulas" target="_blank">tells us</a> that “Hispanics commit three times more violent crimes than whites,” but that the disparity could be even greater because of their often being classified as white.</p>
<p>The National Youth Gang Survey Analysis <a href="http://www.nationalgangcenter.gov/Survey-Analysis/Demographics" target="_blank">report</a>s that gang members are approximately 49 percent Hispanic, 35 percent black and 10 percent white. And while whites are 35 percent of NYC’s population, blacks and Hispanics <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/2013/07/19/black-americas-real-problem-isnt-white-racism/" target="_blank">commit</a> 96 percent of all crime in the Big Apple and 98 percent of all gun crime.</p>
<p>Another good indicator is international crime statistics. Hispanic countries <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate_by_decade#2010s" target="_blank">dominate</a> the homicide-rate rankings, with Honduras topping the list with a rate eight times as high as that of our worst state, Louisiana. Also note that there are no European/European descent nations in the top 20 and not one Western-tradition nation in the top 30 (Russia and Moldova are 24 and 28, respectively).</p>
<p>And what can we say about these “people” differences? It’s much as with the question of why men are more likely to be drunkards than women. You could explore whether the differences were attributable to nature, nurture or both. But it would be silly to wonder if the answer lay in men having greater access to bars, alcohol or shot glasses.</p>
<p>This brings us to why covering up minority criminality encourages gun control:</p>
<p>Americans won’t understand that the critical factor is people differences if they aren’t told about the people differences.</p>
<p>They will then — especially since most citizens aren’t even aware that there are nations with more firearms but less murder — be much more likely to blame guns. Of course, this is precisely what you want if you’re a left-wing media propagandist.</p>
<p>There is a question that could now be posed by the other side: if the main difference in criminality is demographics, why not outlaw guns? After all, it won’t make a difference one way or the other, right? I’ll offer a couple of answers to this question.</p>
<p>First, for a people to maintain just liberties, a freedom must <em>always</em> be considered innocent until proven guilty; the burden of proof is not on those who would retain it, but on those who would take it away.</p>
<p>Second, while private gun ownership and just law enforcement can’t turn barbarians into civilized people any more than excellent schools can transform dunces into geniuses, they can act as mitigating factors that minimize criminality as much as possible given the “raw material” with which the particular society has to work. It’s much as how you can maximize your personal safety: you may be safer in a great neighborhood with no martial arts training than in a terrible one with that training. Nonetheless, it allows you to be safer than you would be otherwise whatever neighborhood you choose.</p>
<p>And what do the stats show in our fair to middling USA neighborhood? Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck reported that guns are used by good citizens 2.2 to 2.5 million times per year to deter crime. That likely saves many more innocent lives than are lost in massacres every year, but these unseen non-victims don’t make headlines the way Sandy Hook tragedies do. That’s why I like to say, using a twist on a Frédéric Bastiat line, a bad social analyst observes only what can be seen. A good social analyst observes what can be seen — and what must be foreseen.</p>
<p>Lastly, one more truth becomes evident upon recognizing that demographics are the main factor in criminality: even if you do believe in gun control, imposing it federally and applying a one-size fits all standard is ridiculous. In terms of people and crime, there’s a world of difference between towns in New Hampshire or Vermont, with their England-level murder rates, and cities such as East St. Louis, IL, or Detroit, which rival El Salvador in citizen lethality. You can make gun control the same everywhere, but you can’t change the fact that people will be very, very different.</p>

</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">For decades liberals have lobbied against punishment and for rehabilitation. The argument was that a mugger or murderer was just a victim of his environment, someone caught in the crosshairs of bad nurturing and neighborhood. Accountability is unwarranted because the person bears no responsibility: he knew not what he did. And so successful was this movement that our penal system was largely reorganized based on the rehabilitation model. Why, I’ve even argued with people who insisted that “punishment doesn’t work” (apparently, they’d never heard of Singapore, caning and virtually zero crime).</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">So, question: where are the calls for rehabilitation, as opposed to punishment, for “racists” such as Clippers owner Donald Sterling?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And the rehabilitation mentality’s absence isn’t just apparent in the social ostracism and career destruction visited on those accused of the One Liberal Deadly Sin of “racism”*.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">(*Some exceptions may apply.)</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It isn’t even just apparent in the social persecution of supposed “haters” in general, from Brendan Eich to the Boy Scouts to devout Christians.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Just consider leftism-disgorged “hate-crime” law. It proves ever so explicitly that, somehow, liberals have discovered the utility of punishment; after all, they will justify this legislation by saying that since some crimes target whole communities, they’re so destructive that a message must be sent. It appears that when their own ideological ox is being gored, the people who authored the atheist version of “the Devil made him do it” want Devil’s Island.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A good example is Donald Sterling. It’s not enough that he has had his reputation destroyed, been fined $2.5 million and been “banned for life” by the National Bolsheviks Association. There are people who want newspapers to stop accepting his ads. And the bigoted Al Sharpton — proving hypocrisy knows no bounds — had actually said that the Clippers should be disbanded. Yes, and maybe we should adopt the North Korean model of purging Sterling’s family and friends, too. But how much punishment is enough? How many pounds of flesh will sate the rapacious and blood-stained leftist palate? Would only a gulag and a long, slow, painful death suffice for the world’s Sterlings?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">None of this is a surprise if you understand that liberals don’t operate based on principles, but feelings; in keeping with this, liberalism isn’t an ideology. It is a <span style="font-style: italic;">process</span>. Even Marxism has a vision for how society should be (unrealistic though it is), but liberals do not. The only consistent definition of liberalism is “a desire to change the status quo,” which means there will always be, without a guiding vision, directionless, unprincipled change and action. Liberals are the children who ever fight the parents simply because that is the nature of the brat, and they do this even when yesterday’s liberals have become the parents.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">How does this relate to punishment? A person operating on principle, on a vision, will try to tame his emotion and say: here’s the crime, here’s what justice dictates, so here is the proportionate punishment. But with liberals there is no justice — it’s “just us” as they’re governed by the shifting sands of convenience. Their feelings tell them that they hate the transgressor and that they want revenge, and it’s never enough to satisfy them viscerally. It’s as with the feeling of hunger: no matter how much you eat, there’s always another appetite mere hours away.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This governance by emotion helps explain why “*Some exceptions may apply.” It sheds light on why liberals haven’t made a federal case out of Bellville, NJ, Democrat mayoral candidate Marie Strumolo Burke, who lamented proposed tax-rate changes and was <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/04/30/media-refuses-to-identify-party-affiliation-of-new-jersey-democrat-caught-in-racist-rant-audio/" target="_blank">caught</a> on audio exclaiming, “This is gonna be a f*****g n****r town!” It illuminates why they did nothing when then NBA owner Jay-Z threw a 2010 party in which <a href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2014/05/nba-hypocrisy-black-nba-owner-held.html" target="_blank">no whites were allowed</a>. It even explains why Sterling, whose views were long known, received not only a special dispensation but also acclaim and awards from the left. As part of their political phalanx, liberals don’t hate Burke; they don’t hate bigoted blacks such as Jay-Z; they don’t even hate rich, old white men who pay their dues and pay off the cause. And disconnected from Truth and thus having “situational values,” it’s easy for libs to live in a world of rationalization. Just give them plausible deniability in their own minds, so, as Mark Cuban once said about Sterling, they can shrug off the sin as the eccentricities of a fellow who “plays by his own rules.” But don’t you dare out yourself if you’re a white guy. Don’t become a liability to the cause. It’s as if the mistake isn’t the act (at least if you’re one of the initiated) — the mistake is getting caught.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But with those who aren’t part of their phalanx, liberals will hate, hate, hate; they will hunger for vengeance and, since vengeance never eliminates hate (only forgiveness does), there is never an end to their retribution.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To be clear, I’m not saying that outrage over “racism” is always mere artifice. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it’s reminiscent of medieval heresy accusations, which could be leveled against an individual by vindictive people with an axe to grind. But much of the time if not most, the anger is real.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It’s just selectively triggered.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In rare cases, the transgression itself may be enough to induce the emotional response. Most of the time, however, it’s some combination of transgression+transgressor+<wbr></wbr>situation. Transgressor can negate transgression, as when a black person makes a bigoted remark; or transgressor can magnify transgression, as when a white Republican makes a corresponding remark. If a white Democrat or Democrat enabler does, transgressor status plus a situation in which you somehow maintain that plausible deniability gets you by. If it’s a wealthy, powerful black man whose success is necessary for the cause, as with Barack Obama, well, then you’re bulletproof. Then again, if you’re a wealthy, powerful white man whose failure is necessary for the cause, as with George Allen and “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaca_%28term%29" target="_blank">macaca</a>,” you’re history.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This isn’t to say that most liberals are fully conscious of what animates them. Self-awareness is often lacking among man, and this is especially true among philosophically dysfunctional men (who we today often call liberals). All most leftists know when spewing venom at a supposedly “racist” conservative is that they hate the person, and they assume it’s only because of his transgression. Living situational lives where everything is compartmentalized, they generally don’t know what truly drives them or consider, at the moment they’re wallowing in hatred, that in the past they’ve reacted very differently to liberals in the same boat.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, another factor is that liberals don’t view these transgressions the way a normal person would. They often “feel” — “think” would be the wrong word because, again, leftists generally operate emotionally — that a black’s or liberal’s uttering of a racial remark is of a very different moral species than when a white conservative does so. A black has a right to such sentiments because of the “legacy of slavery.” As for a white liberal, it was perhaps just a weak moment, a slip of the tongue; after all, the person has proven his credentials with his public face as a good leftist foot soldier. If a white conservative says the same thing, however (which never seems nearly as common), it just reflects the deep-seated bigotry that you have to know resides in his dark soul.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Going even deeper, understand that this accords with liberals’ favored reality-denying modern isms. <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nominalism" target="_blank">Nominalism</a> states there is nothing that objectively makes both a tiger and a buff tabby “cats,” categorically speaking — we just happen to view them that way. Likewise, a normal person may see two bigoted statements or two acts of punishment as occupying the same category, but there is, objectively speaking, no such thing as a category called “bigoted statements” or “acts of punishment.” Such classifications only exist in our minds, so we can assign these labels as we see fit. And in deference to relativism, which boils down to the notion that there’s no right or wrong, neither punishment nor rehabilitation can be inherently good or bad, and consistency can be no better than inconsistency.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">At bottom, this is how devout leftists view the world. Subscribing to the Protagorean proposition “Man is the measure of all things” and the apocryphal one “Might makes right,” when they win culture wars and take control, they make themselves the measure of all things. Perhaps the best characterization of their philosophy is occultist Aleister Crowley’s formulation, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And what they wilt do is persecute you. Remember that, nice-guy conservatives, the next time you want to fight them using Queensbury Rules.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The grimmest dictatorship is the dictatorship of the prevailing orthodoxy&#8221; - </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/02/international/europe/02galloway.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=a3295fe213e5261f&amp;ex=1277956800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">George Galloway</a></p>
<p>In a relativism culture of social permissiveness, the non-judgmental attitude, held out as the suitable standard for conduct, has become the politically correct behavior. One might think that anything goes under this mindset. However, the exact opposite practice and enforcement, under the most rigid conditions, is championed as necessary for enlighten and tolerant liberalists. The proliferation of demands that hate speech is the new capital crime, actually is counter iterative in building a civil society. This orthodoxy of the fanatical, proudly presents this illuminated and required deportment, as obligatory for all citizens.</p>
<p>So what exactly is hate for the neo-Jacobins? Obviously, whatever the &#8220;<em>Society of the Friends of the LIVING Constitution</em>&#8221; deems it to be, because under the color of law, the self-proclaimed pure of heart, are justified to off the heads of anyone who dares speak out in inappropriate terms. Remember &#8220;thinking progress&#8221; for the greater good, must be imposed on anyone who dare defies the wisdom of the gatekeepers for the collective.</p>
<p>Racism has to go, unless practiced by Negros against whites, or is the mere mention of such a term a slight to African-Americans? Once upon a time cries of anti-Semitism would be heard if <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/la-naacp-head-resigns-move-honor-sterling-23556060">Donald Sterling</a> was made a pariah after the NAACP did an about face after awarding him for promoting civil rights. Not in today’s world, such a distasteful zealot no longer has the protection of his tribe from the scrutiny of the thought police. The almost total condemnation of his recently private remarks has the entire sports world clambering for his forced sale of the LA Clippers.</p>

<p>Such broad-minded fans in a league that made homies multimillionaires and took them out of the hood, must not be dis. No wonder the attraction of not just the NBA, but sports in general, have serious minded buffs of the Wide World of Sports looking for, &#8220;<em>The Thrill of Victory&#8230;</em>&#8221; in other arenas. Why not demonstrate that sporting enthusiasm and jock celebrity worship, by starting a grassroots campaign to install America’s favorite redneck, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/conservatives-defend-duck-dynasty-star-phil-robertsons-anti-gay-remarks-1516160">Phil Robertson</a> and his Duck Dynasty clan, as the new ownership of the team.Surely, good standing Democrats should have no problem supporting a bunch of good old boys from the South. Frances Rice writes in the National Black Republicans Association site that, <a href="http://www.nationalblackrepublicans.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=pages.DYKKKKTerroristArmoftheDemocratParty">KKK Terrorist Arm of the Democratic Party</a>. &#8220;This ugly fact about the Democrat Party is detailed in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Reconstruction-Eric-Foner/dp/0060964316">A Short History of Reconstruction</a>, (Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc., 1990) by Dr. Eric Foner, the renowned liberal historian who is the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. Dr. Foner in his book explores the history of the origins of Ku Klux Klan and provides a chilling account of the atrocities committed by Democrats against Republicans, black and white.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/">Carole Emberton</a>, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today. Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Fast forward to today’s conductor <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/eric_holder_hate_crimes_and_his_people.html">Eric Holder</a>, of selective bigoted <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/032414.html">racism</a>, when describing &#8220;his people&#8221;, who &#8220;seem to get a pass on hate crime charges when they select whites for their blood sport&#8221;, one needs to question who the real haters are. David Risselada provides a valid assessment in the essay, <a href="http://patriotupdate.com/articles/hate-crimes-legislation-racial-identity-politics-institutional-racism-left/">Hate Crimes Legislation . . . Racial Identity Politics and the Institutional Racism of the Left</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The institutional racism that is built in our society is the responsibility of the left. Throughout history it has been the democrats who have supported segregation and slavery while continuously voting against civil rights legislation. Today, they attempt to hide their history through racial identity politics, and the creation of a system where inequality is the new equality. By creating laws based on racial preferences, the left is telling minorities that they believe they are not as capable as white men and therefore need their programs in order to stand a chance in the racist United States of America. This does little but reinforce hatred while attempting to justify black on white violence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time and in a place long ago, the Democratic Party defended the rights of the individual to associate with individuals of their choosing and speak their minds openly and without concern of censor. Since the conversion to ecumenical orthodoxy, the authoritarians that gave you the New Deal and the Great Society have a long record of creating their own hatred of Free Speech. The example of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?hp">New York Times</a> vicious attack on <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2014/04/24/cliven-bundy-controversial-remarks-full-context-video-with-transcript/">Cliven Bundy</a> illustrates another trumped-up incident ripe to exploit.The New American, author William F. Jasper makes the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Much of what Mr. Bundy is saying closely parallels what even many black leaders, authors and intellectuals — such as Prof. Walter Williams, Rev. C.L. Bryant, Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, Bill Cosby, Alveda King, Star Parker, and Alan Keyes — have been saying. But Cliven Bundy’s &#8220;sin&#8221; is that he is an elderly white man who is unschooled in traversing the minefield of political correctness — and he was careless in failing to make important distinctions and clarifications. He &#8220;sinned&#8221; by being born when he was born, and failing to keep up with the constantly changing terminology for ethnic designations. He still uses the terms &#8220;Negro,&#8221; &#8220;colored people,&#8221; and &#8220;Mexican,&#8221; instead of &#8220;black/ African American&#8221; or &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; — but then, race activists still argue amongst themselves concerning the &#8220;proper&#8221; ethnic label to apply to their lineage and group identity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When Senator <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/goodbye-free-speech-mass-dem-wants-government-to-monitor-speech-for-hate">Ed Markey</a>, D-Mass., introduces legislation called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2014-04-08_HateCrimes_Legislation1.pdf">Hate Crime Reporting Act of 2014</a>,&#8221; it is another partisan concerted attempt to silence voices and views entirely protected under the First Amendment, by monitoring radio, television and Internet speech. Can one say arbitrary and capricious, or will Big Brother now prey on any convenient and moving target to label anyone as a hate monger, that does not conform to the &#8220;PC&#8221; orthodoxy?</p>

<p>The excellent video from Ben Swann identifies in <a href="http://youtu.be/fTn6skhq-08">New &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; Bill Will Attempt To Control Speech On Internet, Radio and TV</a>, that the real objective is to censor the internet.</p>
<p>Well, this development should concern any student of inquiry, but the real world often fosters political threats that seem to be so implausible, if they were not true. The case of the arrest of <a href="http://vdare.com/posts/britain-quoting-winston-churchill-about-islam-is-now-an-arrestable-offense">Paul Weston</a> should alarm everyone. In the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/michael-coren-interviews-paul-weston-concerning-his-free-speech-arrest">Michael Coren interview or Mr. Weston</a>, the vanguard of British lunacy once again blazes new trails in the annals of hate speech. If quoting Winston Churchill is now a crime, what does that make Winnie?The British Bulldog is his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property — either as a child, a wife, or a concubine — must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Move over denial ridden Americans; the English have a talent in leading the civilized world in false guilt. For the rest of humankind, they are perceptive enough to admit that the normal human condition acknowledges <a href="http://batr.org/view_/060501.html">Discrimination as a Virtue</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Discrimination has been characterized as racism. Quite to the contrary, discrimination is an ally in the struggle to end bigotry and injustice. When Liberty is suppressed in a quest for equality; hatred and revulsion breeds, for different groups, cultures and ideologies. All attempts to force equal treatment are futile, even when severe penalties are imposed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Condemning a person, solely by his beliefs, bias and predisposition – that fanatical frenzy will surely bring about the fall of our cherished tradition of Free Speech. For those who fear Sharia Law, you had better be more concerned about the progressive despots, who are the model for imposed intolerance through a government, which hates everyone that refuses their Groupthink.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Never let a racial crisis go to waste is, I suppose, the credo of the Machiavellian mainstream media. Since the release of the Don Sterling audio, liberals haven’t missed a chance to play the race card for all its worth. One of the worst offenders is a New York <span style="font-style: italic;">Daily News</span> columnist named Harry Siegel, who — in a <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/sterling-slain-race-remains-article-1.1773457" target="_blank">piece</a> of pablum bearing a picture of NBA owners portrayed as Klansmen — bemoans the lack of Diversity™ in league ownership and management. Unfortunately for Siegy, his points, which start with the Klan hoods, only get worse from there.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A man with a conscience (malformed though it is), Siegel laments that the NBA is “a league where three-quarters of the players are black, but fewer than half the coaches and not even a fifth of the league office staff are black, as of October, 2013, and every majority team owner except Michael Jordan is white.” But there’s an easy remedy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Institute a quota ensuring that whites, and other races, get proportionate representation among NBA players.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This would make the league approximately 63 percent white, 17 percent Hispanic, 13 percent black and 6 percent Asian. The remaining one percent can be represented by Clint Eastwood’s empty chair on the sidelines, and we can throw in a primordial dwarf if it makes the Diversity™ didacts feel better.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And why not? Why should proportionality go only one way? The bias here lies in self-righteously bloviating about Diversity™ when whites dominate an area while acting as if you don’t even notice it when blacks do.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, liberals would say that the players have earned their positions. But how do we know the owners haven’t? After all, some individuals definitely seem to have a gift for building financial empires. This isn’t to say that every rich person makes his fortune through respectable means. Heck, some people even make millions dribbling a ball around.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But it seems that liberals, prejudiced to the core, only have a problem with it when the “wrong” groups succeed. With the contraception con spent, Barack Obama (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_be_upon_him_%28Islam%29" target="_blank">PBUH</a>) has used his Teleprompter recently to rail against the male/female wage gap — and he wasn’t talking about the one where young urban women earn 8 percent more than their male peers (because they’re 50 percent more likely to graduate college; I don’t think ol’ Barry mentions this gap, either). Libs could also cite how NBA owners are inordinately Jewish, but that narrative won’t work yet. And the highest-earning religious group in the nation is Hindus, but, last I heard, colleges weren’t schooling mush-head kids in “Hindu privilege.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But talking about those things might be “publicly toxic”; you know, in the sense that Siegel said he’s sure that Sterling is “not the only owner whose private thoughts are publicly toxic.” No doubt. And I’m certain this is limited to rich white NBA owners, or at least white people in general. It also occurs to me, however, that people can develop a tolerance for certain toxins, such as when black ex-basketball players suggest all-black leagues or black civil-rights hustlers <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm" target="_blank">call a cit</a>y “Hymietown.” And, in keeping with the toxicological principle “The dose makes the poison,” tolerance for toxins disgorged by whites stands at about .010 parts per million.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Then there are the millions, of dollars, that Siegel laments the NBA players are not getting, writing that theirs is a “league where the 360 or so athletes who, in fact, make the game, split its proceeds about 50-50 with ownership.” Note that he also dismissed the owners, who allegedly believe they make the game, as “[w]ealthy men…[who] think highly of their own contributions.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now, some might say that the fans make the game; after all, you earn zilch without a market. But what is Siegel’s point? Wouldn’t the proceeds split be much the same in the virtually all-white NHL? And how is that different from any corporation or successful business? A person doesn’t invest his heart and soul and risk capital in a venture without the carrot of a possibly handsome return; not even liberals such as Little Big Gulp (a.k.a. Michael Bloomberg), Warren Buffet and Donald Sterling do that.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">So it sounds as if Siegel is lamenting economic freedom, as if he’d prefer a Marxist model (this certainly would have the upside of not enriching men who dribble balls and pundits who dribble ideas). Of course, nothing is stopping the players from pooling their resources and trying to buy into their team.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But perhaps most telling about Siegel’s article is what could be akin to a Freudian slip. A recurrent theme of his is that “we” can feel good about ourselves for taking the principled stand against Sterling, but there is much work yet to do. He writes, “We can all take a moment and pat ourselves on the back for not being as horrible as this appalling old man,” and later, “Once we’re done feeling good about not being Sterling…,” it’s time to beat the Diversity™ drum. But he also self-righteously states that Sterling’s “obscene behavior…has been well documented” and asks, “how could this have gone on for so long?”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What this gets at is the phoniness of the left. Let’s be clear on something: the “we” here isn’t me. It’s not most of you readers, the Heritage Foundation, Catholic Church or Southern Baptist Convention.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is the left.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Notoriously liberal Mark Cuban, who now calls Sterling “abhorrent,” said in 2009, “I like Donald. He plays by his own rules.&#8221; (Translation: a lib who becomes a liability to the cause is “abhorrent.” A lib who is getting away with it “plays by his own rules.”) Black actor Leon Isaac Kennedy called Sterling “a prince among men.” The NAACP gave him an award and was set to bestow another. And ex-NBA commissioner David Stern, who some libs now criticize for not only tolerating the owner but even rewarding him, is, like Sterling, a Democrat donor.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The “we,” libs, is you.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It’s not conservatives. It’s not white people. It’s <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">You anointed yourselves arbiters and overseers of acceptable racial commentary; “racism” is your hang-up, your defined One Deadly Sin, your great litmus test. Don’t blame “society” — upholding <span style="font-style: italic;">your</span>principles is <span style="font-style: italic;">your</span> responsibility.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">So most of the lib outrage over “racism” is, when not downright phony, motivated by selectively triggered emotion. It’s a ploy used to tear down tradition and traditionalists on specious grounds and win the culture war. It’s not for lib-enablers, such as late Senator Robert Byrd, who’d been in the KKK; blacks such a Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton; Bill Clinton with his Obama-coffee remark; or fat cats who make big donations — until it’s time to throw them under the bus.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As for Siegel, if he’s so concerned about Diversity™, perhaps he could turn his columnist slot over to a minority. After all, the vast majority of columnists are white, Siegy, and you wouldn’t want some future writer to have to lament, “how could this have gone on for so long?”</p>

				<p>May 13, 2014 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20361#respond" title="Comment on So What If Cliven Bundy Is A “Racist”?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="20361 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20361">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>

</div>
<p style="color: #000000;">For the record, I don’t believe Cliven Bundy is a “racist.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For the record, I don’t even care.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Such indifference to that damnable failing, that thing we all know is the worst thing one can be, must make me a damnable man. But I am flexible. I just want equality. I’m perfectly willing to demonize “racists,” provided we give other sinners equal time.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">I just want to hear, for example, “Forget the facts of the matter! The man is lustful!” or “Don’t listen to that miscreant. He’s guilty of sloth!” Or let’s say a fellow posits an opinion on, oh, taxation. Our very intellectual response could be, “Hey, didn’t I hear you talkin’ to your girlfriend about how you scarfed down four cheeseburgers at the barbecue and binged on ice cream in your easy chair? Look, everyone, he’s a glutton!”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This isn’t to say that being a bigot — the word “racist” is in quotation marks because it’s an invention of leftist language manipulators — is a good thing. Not at all. But neither is being lustful, slothful or gluttonous. Yet people who couldn’t name three of the Seven Deadly Sins and are thoroughly guilty of at least six, will claim they can disqualify a person, and his point of view, from debate based on their assessment of his moral state. What blindness — and hubris.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Bigotry is simply a sub-category of wrath, one part of one-seventh, not the moral end-all and be-all. And even if Bundy did have racial hang-ups, would it follow that he was wrong about his case or on federal power in general? Can a man be flawed, and even sinful, but yet right on a matter? Can he still have virtues? Albert Einstein could be lewd and lascivious, Galileo an irascible jerk, Ernest Hemingway was a drunkard.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This isn’t to say, as certain people with poor character once averred, that character doesn’t matter. It’s not to say a person’s vices can’t speak to motivations; it’s valid to point it out if a judge who rules that pornography has First Amendment protections habitually views porn himself. But it’s not valid to fixate on the allegedly “racist” tendencies of a judge who rules that racial commentary enjoys such protections (at least not within the context of analyzing the ruling). The difference is that since the former is wrong, there’s good reason to believe that his personal inclinations corrupted his judgment on the matter; with the latter judge, however, dwelling on the supposed flaw in question would only serve to discredit a legitimate ruling.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The point is that we all have flaws, yet all can be correct about a whole host of things. I wouldn’t have wanted Einstein to care for a teenage daughter or be president, but I wouldn’t deny that E=mc2.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, it really is true that some flaws are more unequal than others — there is a hierarchy of sin — but moderns’ sense of proportion is highly askew. G.K. Chesterton said that a “Puritan is a person who pours righteous indignation into the wrong things.” Today we have Impuritans, complete reprobates worshipping at hedonism’s altar, who pour their indignation onto others in a vain attempt to wash their own souls clean of sin. But there is much more to being a “good” person than simply not being bigoted.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To further illustrate this askew sense of proportion, consider again the gluttony example. Gluttony is a sin, no doubt. But now let’s say that our society considered it the ultimate disqualifier. Let’s say we might scrutinize a person, asking “What are his food bills?” “Do cookbooks figure too prominently in his library?” “Does he wile away excessive time watching <span style="font-style: italic;">Emeril Live</span>?” “Is he the one who cleared the buffet table like a hurdler?” And imagine we visited pariah status on the person after deeming him guilty.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Would you think this society’s greater fault was gluttony — or being hung-up about it? I’d think it exhibited a gluttonous zeal for eradicating gluttony.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The problem is that man always swings from one extreme to another. The early to mid 20th century saw the embrace of eugenics and racial-superiority dogma, which was then discredited by the loathsome Nazis. But now we just as zealously impose a dogma denying the reality of group differences and mandating equality of outcome among races.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This tendency toward true extremism — meaning, extreme deviation from Truth — brings to mind C.S. Lewis’ observation that evil always tries to persuade us to exaggerate our flaws, telling the militant he’s too pacifistic and the pacifist that he’s too militant. As an example, today we have Impuritans who, awash in the Great Sexual Heresy, will still lament how “Puritan” America is so sexually “repressed.” Evil tells the pervert he’s too prudish, just as it tells self-hating whites that they’re too anti-black.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But what we should be is anti-“racism.” I don’t mean what you think. We need to oppose both the word and the concept — at least how the latter is often conceptualized.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Bigotry is bad by definition, and that definition is commonly agreed upon. But “racism” often has a different meaning, one whose influence is readily apparent in the reaction to Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s much reported comments. Al Sharpton, who once used the term “white interlopers” and once said, “White folks was in caves while we were building empires…,” called for a boycott of the NBA. Former hoop star Larry Johnson reacted to a man who didn’t want blacks around by saying he didn’t want whites around, as he suggested creating an all-black basketball league. Spike Lee <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/04/29/spike-lee-sterling-has-mentality-of-a-slave-master-sees-his-players-as-slaves/" target="_blank">told</a> CNN he wished that white NBA players would speak out against Sterling, which is a bit like John Gotti having wished that someone would speak out against racketeering. And Barack Obama took time away from destroying our world standing, healthcare system, social policy and economy to say that “comments reportedly made by Sterling are ‘incredibly offensive racist statements,’ before casting them as part of a continuing legacy of slavery and segregation that Americans must confront,” <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/04/29/spike-lee-sterling-has-mentality-of-a-slave-master-sees-his-players-as-slaves/" target="_blank">wrote</a> CBS DC. He then opined, “When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don’t really have to do anything; you just let them talk” (you don’t have to do anything except, I suppose, “confront” a “legacy of slavery and segregation”). But, okay, I’ll just let Obama talk.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now, opportunism is often a factor in such hypocrisy, but there is something else: a striking sense of entitlement. This is why many black people will condemn a white person for making a bigoted comment with an equally bigoted comment without batting an eye; when whites are bigoted, it’s “racist”; when blacks are, it’s something else. And, in fact, this idea is encapsulated in the definition of “racism” I alluded to earlier. It’s one you’ve probably heard:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Only whites can be “racist” because a prerequisite for “racism” is not only bigoted intent, but the power to act upon it.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And, actually, they’ll get no argument from me. As I’ve said before, the left originated the word “racism,” so they may define it. They may have it.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And if they ask, I’ll tell them where they can stick it.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The problem is that conservatives, being conservative — meaning, conserving yesterday’s liberals’ social victories — parrot the word. It’s another example of how, forgetting that the side defining the vocabulary of a debate, wins the debate, conservatives slavishly use the Lexicon of the Left.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, eventually this will all be left in the dustbin of history. Movements, peoples and civilizations come and go, and we’ll get over our fixation with one part of one-seventh of the Deadly Sins. And then man will swing to another extreme, as he goes on to the next great mistake.</p>

<p>If a famine befell us and you couldn’t save everyone, would you withhold the food you had and let every citizen starve rather than endure the inequality of just saving some? If recent history is any guide, certain leftists just might say yes.</p>
<p>A good example of this phenomenon involved a multiple sclerosis patient in Gothenburg, Sweden, who was denied a more effective and expensive medication — even though he was willing to pay for it — because, <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/walterewilliams/2009/03/04/swedens_government_health_care/page/full" target="_blank">wrote</a> columnist Walter Williams in 2009, “bureaucrats said it would set a bad precedent and lead to unequal access to medicine.” No wonder Winston Churchill said that socialism’s “inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.”</p>
<p>And another example just reared its ugly head in Plymouth, Michigan, where the locality’s high school is tearing down newly constructed bleachers in deference to the equality police. MyFoxDetroit.com reports on the issue, <a href="http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/25095169/brand-new-set-of-baseball-bleachers-torn-down-after-ruling-that-girls-softball-teams-seats-must-be-equal#ixzz2xetzrArT" target="_blank">writing</a>:</p>
<p>A new set of seating is being torn down outside the Plymouth Wildcats varsity boys&#8217; baseball field, not long before the season begins, because the fields for boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; athletics must be equal.</p>
<p>A group of parents raised money for a raised seating deck by the field, as it was hard to see the games through a chain-link fence. The parents even did the installation themselves, and also paid for a new scoreboard.</p>
<p>So what happened? Some unnamed malcontent lodged a complaint with the feral government, at which point U.S Education Department Office for Civil Rights overlords decreed that the seating must go. Ain’t equality grand?</p>
<p>Except that equality is simply a ruse. And think about it with respect to this issue: the principle is that facilities “for boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; athletics must be equal,” but are boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; athletics equal? The striking contradiction in these male/female sports equality controversies is that calls for “equality” are deferred to within the context of the acceptance and promotion of an inherently unequal system. That is to say, if equality is the guiding principle here, why have separate leagues, teams and tours — protected from the best competition — for girls and women?</p>
<p>The solution, whether it’s the Plymouth situation or calls for equal prize money in tennis, is simple. If a lightweight boxer wants the purses the heavyweights get, he needs to fight and succeed in the heavyweight class; likewise, if feminists want what the boys/men have, they should try to compete in their arena. And I do advocate this: eliminate separate categories for women, and let the sexes compete together on a level playing field. After all, to echo what Lincoln said about laws, the best way to eliminate bad social policy is to enforce it strictly. If you believe in equality, practice it.</p>
<p>Live it.</p>
<p>And live with it.</p>
<p>And since the boys’ American high-school mile record is considerably faster than the women’s world record — and since this gap appears, with some variation, across sports — my proposal would provide some necessary “policy clarification.”</p>
<p>The education department’s decree is also an attack on charity. The message is that pursuing good works just might be a waste of time because, inevitably, they’ll conflict with some government regulation or mandate. It’s in addition a quasi-Marxist assault on the market. After all, the Plymouth community’s interest in building new baseball bleachers was no doubt driven by there being greater fan turnout for the boys’ games. And the market renders such verdicts all the time. It’s said that female fashion models earn three times what their male counterparts do, bars may offer women free drinks or entry without a cover charge, and no one troubles over women-only health clubs. It’s only when market determinations seem to benefit boys or men that the equality ruse is trotted out.</p>
<p>The truth is that equality dogma is a fiction of modern times. As for the timeless, the word “equality” appears in only 21 biblical verses, mostly referring to matters such as weights and measures. There’s good reason for this, and don’t blame it on the supposed “backwardness” of religion because a devout evolutionist would have to be the staunchest believer in hierarchies born of natural inequality. As G.K. Chesterton pointed out, “[I]f they [people] were not created equal, they were certainly evolved unequal.” Look around you at the world of nature and man, which, if the evolutionists are correct, are certainly one and the same. How much equality do you see? Rams butt heads, and one ram wins and the other loses; wolves have alphas and one male lion dominates and leads a pride. Then, there are 3.1 billion possible combinations when a couple has a child. And, oh, what combinations they can be. How many of us can play golf like Tiger Woods, defy gravity and shoot baskets like Michael Jordan or compose music at four years of age as did Mozart? People have greatly varying IQs, physical capabilities, personalities, inclinations toward virtue and gifts. Equality is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>This variation exists among groups, too. Ashkenazi Jews have the world’s highest average IQ, while Asians enjoy that status insofar as major groups go. And disease and conditions have no regard for equality, either: the Pima Indians have the highest rate of diabetes on Earth, breast cancer afflicts mainly women, the incidence of Tay-Sachs disease is highest among Jews, black men suffer from prostate cancer at twice the rate whites do, while sickle-cell anemia is found almost exclusively among blacks. I guess reality is “racist.”</p>
<p>Reality is actually this: it’s completely illogical and contradictory for a person to claim on one hand that he believes in classical, cosmic-accident evolution, but on the other that all groups somehow, quite accidentally, wound up the same in capacity, inclination and worldly abilities. After all, since evolution holds that groups lived and developed separately for millions of years — subject to different environments, stresses, adaptive requirements and to the luck of the draw — their winding up “equal” was, for all intents and purposes, a mathematical impossibility.</p>
<p>Earlier evolutionists recognized and accepted this reality, mind you, and in fact <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/history/item/4675-engineering-oblivion-eugenics-the-remaking-of-man-and-unmaking-of-morality" target="_blank">became eugenicists</a>. Note here that the term “eugenics” was coined by Charles Darwin’s cousin Sir Francis Galton. Also note that the concept greatly predates the term: Greek philosopher Plato advocated murdering weak children, and the Spartans had actually done it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean I embrace eugenics or classical evolution (my views on the latter are found <a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2008/11/new-american-piece-intelligent-design-and-evolution.html" target="_blank">here</a>). The point is that whether you believe we’re accidentally different or that, as St. Therese <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/therese/stubborn.htm" target="_blank">learned</a>, there are even divinely ordained hierarchies in Heaven, equality is certainly not a thing of this world.</p>
<p>This helps explain why entities prescribing “equality” — such as the early French republic and all the Marxist killing-field regimes — become the worst tyrannies. Since equality is wholly unnatural, its mullahs must violate man’s nature, must trump it and twist it, in an effort to pound their sinister square peg into the round hole of reality. And woe betide he who defies their self-deified will.</p>
<p>Cries for equality are today the second-to-last refuge of a scoundrel (shouts of “racism” are the absolute last). Contrary to what Churchill said, however, they don’t actually visit upon us an equal sharing of misery. Rather, the pigs more equal than others will dispense the ever-diminishing pork to the peons, as they feed at the trough of modern man’s sloth, envy and error.</p>

			<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/racist.jpg" alt="" />For the last half century, the American population, subjected to the greatest dumbing down experiment of psychological manipulation in all of history, has resulted in the adoption of a cultural separation from realty and true self-interest. With all the glorious aspirations, that celebrate a diverse society, the fact that humankind shares the same planet usually is not enough to resolve disparities. While DNA <a href="http://batr.org/archives/part2.html">similarities</a> are the basis of the specie, the genetic differences among races, put aside and banished from polite conversation, still are true and significant. Yet the civilizations that make up this world function as if the tribal differences are often paramount in the social order.The intentional indoctrination that all races are equal rests upon a specious supposition that the goals, objectives and ambitions assign a uniform desire. Once upon a time immigration to the New World came from a European heritage. That influx of settlers provided a similar experience if not an identical cultural attitude. With the introduction of the slave trade economy, the forced transplanting of African captives, initiated a road to social dissolution as demonstrated in today’s racial conflicts.</p>
<p>The notion that this country is a harmonious society fails because of a very basic element that few people will admit. Blacks, Caucasians, Oriental, Native Americans and any combination of mixed races all have an opportunity to interact and grow in moral character and intellectual honesty as the sins of the past are put to rest, in the reciprocal objective of creating a mature society based upon mutual respect.</p>
<p>However, respect needs to be earned and is not an intrinsic ingredient automatically granted to every cultural social mind-set.</p>
<p>Individuals have the ability to make choices. Choosing civilization over barbarianism is within the grasps of any sincere and ethically committed person.</p>
<p>This object of civilized unity builds a future for the greatest numbers. Recognizing that deliberate induced racial animosity has a profound political purpose is essential to understand the motives behind distorted news reporting and the progressive policy agenda that seeks to conquer by dividing the different factions, which populate the country.</p>
<p>Reformist activism, usually portrayed as shaping government programs that provide for &#8220;so called&#8221; well-intentioned coercive laws and regulations, is the media narrative that insults the intelligence of any thinking person.</p>

No better example of this televised psychosomatic pollution that inflicts a national disease of artificial guilt is MSNBC. The notorious medicine-man dispenser of this kind of poison is <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1816884/posts">Al Sharpton</a>. The Reverend has a long record of demeaning his own brothers and sisters by bring new meaning to the term, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffir_(racial_term)">Kaffir</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/07/report-sharpton-invokes-race-215-times-on-his-show-in-2013/">The Daily Caller</a>, political reporter Caroline May cites Sharpton’s consistent race baiting tirades.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;MSNBC host Reverend Al Sharpton invoked race over 200 times last year, <a href="http://www.mrc.org/articles/racy-rev-msnbcs-sharpton-mentions-race-215-times-13">according to a new tally</a> by the conservative Media Research Center.</p>
<p>According to the analysis by Katie Yoder the liberal host said &#8220;race,&#8221; &#8220;racism,&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221; 215 times in 2013 during his MSNBC show PoliticsNation.</p>
<p>&#8220;From opposition to the Obama agenda to guns and even into fashion and food, Sharpton’s finely tuned nose for racism rarely took a day off last year,&#8221; Yoder wrote.</p>
<p>In an example the MRC notes that Sharpton was able to invoke race five times in a single paragraph about Republican attacks on Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in January, John Daly on <a href="http://www.bernardgoldberg.com/">bernardgoldberg.com</a>, publishes the account, <a href="http://www.bernardgoldberg.com/msnbc-twitterer-fired/">MSNBC Twitterer Fired for Race Baiting</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On Wednesday night, conservatives honed in on offensive tweet that appeared on MSNBC’s official Twitter feed. The full tweet read, &#8220;Maybe the rightwing will hate it, but everyone else will go awww: the adorable new #Cheerios ad w/biracial family.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The comment was in reference a new television commercial for Cheerios entitled &#8220;Gracie&#8221; that features a biracial family enjoying a breakfast conversation at their kitchen table. The implication by the MSNBC employee behind the tweet, of course, was that the rightwing in this country is racist, and therefore they would surely be disgusted by the visual scene of a family with one white parent and one black parent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of the story included that other mainstay of race politics and self-reproach apologist, Chris Mathews. The Hardball <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/18/chris_matthews_to_black_msnbc_employee_on_race_im_speaking_now_for_all_white_people_im_sorry.html/looid=NlZTRmZDrkzdU7qFfooL0uqE2HK8UJn-">video</a>, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/18/chris_matthews_to_black_msnbc_employee_on_race_im_speaking_now_for_all_white_people_im_sorry.html">Matthews To Black Guest On Race</a>: &#8220;I&#8217;m Speaking Now For All White People&#8230; I&#8217;m Sorry&#8221;, is a pitiful testimony.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We got to continue this conversation, gentlemen, privately and on television. I mean a lot of people out there &#8212; I&#8217;ll just tell you one thing. And I&#8217;m speaking now for all white people, but especially people who have had to try to change the last 50 or 60 years. And they &#8212; a lot of them have really tried to change, and I&#8217;m sorry for this stuff. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="chrismatthews.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/chrismatthews.jpg" align="Left" /><br />
Tom Borelli, writes in the Liberty Alliance - <a href="http://libertyalliance.com/2013/11/msnbc-chris-matthews-wild-race-card-attack-conservatives/">MSNBC Chris Matthews Wild Race Card Attack Against Conservatives</a>, more from this self-anointed supporter and barker for liberal delusional bigotry.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In his foaming rant, Matthews claims voter I.D. laws are like poll taxes with the goal to suppress black voters and he adds Obama’s political opposition are the enemy that gain from hate:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Obama’s true enemies are those who back the three dozen states now pushing voter suppression laws to make damn sure the country doesn’t go and elect another black president, or a progressive white president. You know this generation’s equivalent of poll taxes and those discredited literacy tests anything to keep minorities from their voting rights. And to this crowd the Obama haters add to them those who gnaw on the president’s health care bill with the hunger of starving rats but offer nothing in its place except their crazed notions about bringing down the government and destroying the county’s economic stature even as they deny even a penny of credit to the president for the zooming American stock market right now. These are the enemies those who stand and benefit from all the anger and hatred and indecency of the nasty right…&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Matthews is once again proving MSNBC is not a news organization but a cable outlet for political operatives whose goal is to spread progressive propaganda.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So does this party line programming, emphasizing a racially slanted mantra, which drives wedges among the viewing public, actually help ratings? The <a href="https://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/nov-2013-ratings-chris-matthews-is-tops-for-msnbc_b205172">TVNewser</a> lists that MSNBC was down across the board compared to Nov. 2012. However, MSNBC ranked #1 among African-American viewers in both A25-54 and total viewers in all key dayparts and MSNBC ranked #1 among Hispanic viewers A25-54 in M-F primetime and M-Su primetime.<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/monday-cable-news-ratings-sharpton-1-in-demo-on-msnbc/">Mediaite</a> lists Sharpton #1 in Demo on MSNBC. Especially review the chart TV NEWS RATINGS: 25-54 DEMOGRAPHIC comparing with the other cable news networks.</p>
<blockquote><p>PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton was the highest-rated show in the 25-54 demo across MSNBC’s evening schedule Monday with 214K viewers. Sharpton beat fellow MSNBC hosts Chris Matthews, who had 209K viewers and Ed Schultz, who had 170K.</p>
<p>Matthews was #1 in total viewers on MSNBC with 844K, followed by Rachel Maddow with 729K and Schultz with 717K.</p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/03/18/pew-study-finds-msnbc-the-most-opinionated-cable-news-channel-by-far/">Pew Study Finds MSNBC the Most Opinionated Cable News Channel By Far</a>, &#8220;A full 85% of the Comcast-owned network’s coverage can be classified as opinion or commentary rather than straight news, according to the authors of the Pew Research Center’s annual State of the News Media report.&#8221;</p>
<p>The significance of this data is that the gap between minority identified and 25-54 viewers and all America is increasing even wider. With the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/02/2013-cable-news-ratings-msnbc-cnn_n_4532020.html">2013 Cable News Ratings</a>: Fox News Sees Sharp Demo Decline, CNN Suffers In Primetime. The race baiters at MSNBC seems to have consolidated their niche among targeted minorities and the products of the more recent government school educated and MTV generation.Decades of liberalizing news distortion and manufactured false re-invention of history has produced a total disconnect from reality. MSNBC is used as a poster boy network for shutting out serious journalism from the medium, but it is almost impossible to find any mainstream broadcasts that are worthy of viewership.</p>
<p>There is a profound reason why the stuck on stupid culture is all around us. Open and rational political debate and discourse is slated for complete removal from television. Anyone who can seriously admit being a MSNBC viewer has deep seeded issues of reckoning sane behavior.</p>
<p>Those limousine liberals love to champion abortion as a well-tested solution of reducing population. Minorities, particularly targeted for marginalization, need to rebel against the democratic politicians and liberal class perversion, whereby <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/nyc-more-black-babies-killed-abortion-born">NYC: More Black Babies Killed by Abortion Than Born</a>. For those who gain a foothold on life, the media brainwashing of the likes of Rev. Al await.Fools who drink from the cup of their own racial genocide are their own worst enemy. The national interest demands that exploitation of race as a substitute for intelligent co-existence end. Compulsory Integration or miscegenation leveling has proven a massive failure. Is it not time that all tribes start a respectful dialogue and abandon the shackles of blaming race discrimination for the general failure of society? Separation by race is natural. This fact is a news topic that serious media and journalists need to address.</p>

<p>Imagine you go overseas and give a speech advocating a cause, only to come home and find you’re being sued for “crimes against humanity.” No, what you did wasn’t illegal under American law or under the laws of the nation in which you expressed your words.</p>
<p>You’re being sued under international law.</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker: Your case will be adjudicated by an American court.</p>
<p>Foreign law in a U.S. court?</p>
<p>This is precisely what befell Massachusetts native Pastor Scott Lively after he gave some speeches critical of homosexuality in Uganda and elsewhere. The suit was filed on behalf of activist group Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMU) by an organization with the temerity to call itself the Center for <i>Constitutional Rights</i> (CCR) (emphasis added). The legal action is based on, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/ugandan-gay-rights-group-sues-scott-lively-an-american-evangelist.html?_r=0">wrote</a> <i>The New York Times</i> in 2012, “the alien tort statute, which allows foreigners to sue in American courts in situations asserting the violation of international law.” SMU claims that Lively incited “the persecution of gay men and lesbians in Uganda,” wrote the <i>Times</i>.</p>
<p>Lively’s speechmaking hit the radar screen because the Ugandan parliament recently passed a law broadening the criminalization of homosexual activity; moreover, the pastor has also spoken in Russia, whose new law against homosexual activism has figured prominently in the reportage on the Winter Olympics in Sochi.</p>
<p>Yet this isn’t — or shouldn’t be — about what Lively did or didn’t say; it’s not about the particular. It’s about the principle:</p>
<p>American courts can adjudicate cases of American citizens sued under law (international law) that the people’s representatives did not in any way enact. Thus, Americans can conceivably be punished under legislation that they had not even an indirect hand in creating.</p>
<p>This is adjudication without representation.</p>
<p>This is an issue because last August federal judge Michael A. Ponsor rejected a motion to dismiss the Lively case filed by the pastor’s lawyers, instead allowing it to proceed to the discovery phase. This is despite the fact that, as activist group Mass Resistance <a href="http://www.massresistance.org/docs/gen2/13a/lively_hearing_010713/ruling_081413.html">reported</a>, the judge “told the CCR lawyer that he is ‘struggling to see actionable behavior’ in anything Lively did or said, and that he can&#8217;t see that any of Lively&#8217;s conduct that [sic] amounts to ‘persecution’ or ‘conspiracy.’” Nonetheless, upon issuing his 79-page ruling, writes Mass Resistance, the judge accepted “<em>all</em> of the points raised by the [George] Soros-backed plaintiffs” and denied “all of the points raised by Lively&#8217;s lawyers.”</p>
<p>Again, though, this isn’t about the facts of any particular case. It’s about using extra-constitutional means to trump Americans’ constitutional rights; it’s about seeking to use international laws and philosophy regarding “hate speech” to circumvent Americans’ First Amendment right to free speech.</p>
<p>Even staunch faux-marriage proponent and committed liberal Jonathan Rauch recognizes the danger. As he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/03/the-painful-case-of-pastor-scott-lively-homophobe-to-the-world/">wrote</a> in a Feb. 3 <i>Washington Post</i> editorial, “On the facts as I read them, the plaintiff’s theory would leave no clear line between speaking one’s mind and engaging in a criminal conspiracy, at least if speaking one’s mind could be plausibly connected to some bad outcome. That theory seems very easy to abuse.”</p>
<p>That’s the understatement of the year. Most any opinion could perhaps be connected to a bad outcome, and a multitude of opinions plausibly so. Did Barack Obama’s post-Trayvon Martin shooting statement, “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” help spark the <a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-04-27/news/os-ed-darryl-owens-trayvon-revenge-042812-20120427_1_racial-slurs-bamboo-torches-justice">revenge attacks</a> on whites that occurred after the event? Could Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) and other eco-terrorists have been influenced by the rhetoric of Al Gore and other environmentalists? And what about the constant racial grievance-mongering of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton? The fact is this: everyone who does evil was influenced by <i>someone</i>.</p>
<p>Everyone.</p>
<p>Moreover, even the expression of the most highly esteemed ideas can lead to negative outcomes (which, if the ideas are actually valid, are generally greatly outweighed by the positive ones). Will liberals consider ceasing environmental activism just because a McDonald’s, a fur store and medical-research laboratories were once firebombed? And warning of pedophilia — as I did in a soon-to-be-published piece on rampant child sex abuse in Hollywood — is always a good work. But what if someone reads my piece and then, enraged, attacks an entertainment figure or sets fire to a production studio? Should I be legally liable?</p>
<p>The Lively case is only different in that the pastor engaged in unfashionable activism. And it’s easy to see what placing Americans at the mercy of “international law” can lead to. Consider a short list of activities that could one day, under the CCR’s conception of the alien tort statute (ATS), result in Americans being tried by American courts using international law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian evangelization, even in a nation where the majority welcomed it: evangelization is illegal in certain places and frowned upon in many others. If Christianity falls into even greater disfavor in the future, spreading the faith could come to be viewed as an invidious “imposition of values.”</li>
<li>Giving a speech on what you view as the dangers of Islam in front of even a receptive foreign parliament: hate-speech laws prohibiting many types of criticism of Islam already abound in the West.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is absolutely possible — all we’d need is for the social winds to blow in the right (or wrong) direction.</p>
<p>And what of this ATS? It was enacted way back in 1789, possibly in an attempt to appease the British after they threatened to retaliate for states’ refusal to satisfy British creditors, as provided for in the treaty ending the American Revolution. This is perhaps why courts based jurisdiction on the ATS only twice between 1789 and 1980. Not surprisingly, however, it has been expanded since ‘80, with judges struggling to determine what is applicable under it. My suggestion?</p>
<p>End the struggle by rescinding the ATS.</p>
<p>Little good comes from ambiguous laws that will continually be interpreted and reinterpreted by an ever shape-shifting judiciary. And these laws almost always benefit the left. After all, conservative judges tend to be originalists who vote based on the law and put their personal beliefs aside, so they generally won’t use ambiguous legislation to advance traditionalism. Leftist judges, however, are relativists who often believe the end justifies the means, and ambiguous law is a favored vehicle through which they can impose their values from the bench.</p>
<p>I don’t think the SMU/CCR will prevail in their case against Lively — not now, anyway.  But with many American judges today having the mentality of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who once told a liberal attorneys’ group that the law profession “must start looking for inspiration beyond our borders, to the laws and constitutions of other nations,” the ability to consider international law when adjudicating should be strictly prohibited. If some foreign statute truly is a good idea, it’s up to the people to enact it through their representatives. No adjudication without representation.</p>

</div>
<p>Over the last half century, the <a href="http://batr.org/twins/id40.html">public school establishment</a> in America has achieved enormous results, if the intention was to dumb down the population. The term public is archaic, since the current age promotes an internationalist interdependency culture, where the state defines institutional roles and sanctions accepted standards. The public plays virtually no effective role in this process. For this reason the proper term to use is government indoctrination centers. Bringing back the <a href="http://www.mcguffeyreaders.com/1836_original.htm">McGuffey Readers</a> as the alternative to the state syllabus of common core is a step in the right direction.Our <a href="http://batr.org/view_/090201.html">Dysfunctional Public Education Is No Accident</a> essay lays out the correct standard.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Education needs to be about teaching the tools, methods and process of &#8220;How To Think&#8221;. The mission of the instructor is one of developing the intuitive nature of inquiry that is natural in every person. Training the intrinsic urge of curiosity as the means of discriminating and rational thought is the prime goal for the educator. But to achieve this level of tutoring the teacher must be founded in their own understand in logic and analytical thinking. In today&#8217;s classroom, social engineering has replaced Aristotle, Locke and Kant with the latest celebrity of multiculturalism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy">Common Core site</a> attempts to outline the purpose and worthiness of their education standards. Sounds like a noble goal; however, what is the reality?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As a natural outgrowth of meeting the charge to define college and career readiness, the Standards also lay out a vision of what it means to be a literate person in the twenty-first century. Indeed, the skills and understandings students are expected to demonstrate have wide applicability outside the classroom or workplace. Students who meet the Standards readily undertake the close, attentive reading that is at the heart of understanding and enjoying complex works of literature. They habitually perform the critical reading necessary to pick carefully through the staggering amount of information available today in print and digitally. They actively seek the wide, deep, and thoughtful engagement with high-quality literary and informational texts that builds knowledge, enlarges experience, and broadens worldviews. They reflexively demonstrate the cogent reasoning and use of evidence that is essential to both private deliberation and responsible citizenship in a democratic republic. In short, students who meet the Standards develop the skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening that are the foundation for any creative and purposeful expression in language.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Susan Berry presents a wealth of information and resource links in her article, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/01/12/Radical-Roots-of-Common-Core-Lead-To-Social-Justice-Indoctrination-In-Math-Class">Common Core Rooted In Math Class Social Justice Indoctrination</a> &#8220;While proponents of the Common Core claim that the new standards are focused on &#8220;college and career readiness,&#8221; more evidence is surfacing that a central purpose of the initiative is <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/04/Roots-of-Common-Core-Lie-In-Association-Between-Barack-Obama-And-Bill-Ayers">social justice and income redistribution indoctrination</a>.&#8221; This one example sums up the dilemma.</p>
<p><img alt="commoncore.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/commoncore.jpg" width="300" align="Left"  /></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Radical Math boasts over 700 lesson plans, articles, charts, books, and websites that cover a wide range of socio-political issues including redistribution of wealth, discrimination against the poor by whites, corporations, banks, etc., and the message that widespread racism against blacks continues in the United States today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now compare this critical appraisal to the lofty mission of math back in the Common Core mission statement. How can this statement below square with the above practice?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For over a decade, research studies of mathematics education in high-performing countries have pointed to the conclusion that the mathematics curriculum in the United States must become substantially more focused and coherent in order to improve mathematics achievement in this country. To deliver on the promise of common standards, the standards must address the problem of a curriculum that is &#8220;a mile wide and an inch deep.&#8221; These Standards are a substantial answer to that challenge.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Integration into a 21th century business and social model is the ultimate intent of the common core objective. Nowhere is there a debate of what kind of future mankind wants or the kind of reality that all human beings are intrinsically part of. Those questions require the study in humanity education and liberal arts training that are quite different from the instruction in algorithm programming.</p>
<p>The world view of this common core inculcation presupposes that society accepts their premises as a <em>fait accompli</em>. Their technocrat approach to instruction demands that authentic education must be marginalized if not outright eliminated. The traditional Christian cosmology has no place in this brave new world. In the article, <a href="http://truthinamericaneducation.com/common-core-state-standards/common-cores-negative-impact-on-education-and-biblical-literacy/">Common Core’s Negative Impact on Education and Biblical Literacy</a>, explains the destructive nature of this dehumanizing standardization.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The central organizing theme of the Common Core ELA standards is that study of creative literature must be diminished in favor of nonfiction &#8220;informational texts.&#8221; The idea is that students should be drilled in the types of documents they are more likely to encounter in their entry-level jobs (and make no mistake, Common Core is a workforce-development model, not an education model).</p>
<p>The fundamental problem with the Common Core approach is that, to achieve its job-training goals, it recognizes no difference between one &#8220;complex&#8221; text and another &#8220;complex&#8221; text. A great work of literature has value far beyond the complexity of the words used – it allows students to understand the eternal human condition; it allows them to confront human challenges that recur throughout the ages; it teaches empathy, prudence, forgiveness; it transports the readers to places and times not their own. The Common Core ELA standards are, quite simply, indifferent to this type of education. Training, not educating, is their goal. They are not interested in helping students become the people God created them to be; they are interested in creating workers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You can just hear the profane condemnation from the <a href="http://www.aft.org/about/innovate/commoncore.cfm">American Federation of Teacher</a> and the <a href="http://neatoday.org/2013/10/16/10-things-you-should-know-about-the-common-core/">National Education Association</a> opposing the mere mention of God in their secular temples of perdition. Irony excluded how biblical revelation dare be debated in a non-judgmental culture of relativism. At the heart of the government school establishment is an unending choir of fallen angels that preach their vision of paradise, while demanding ever higher budgets and far greater control over the indoctrination of their impressionable guinea pigs.</p>
<p><img alt="commoncore2.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/commoncore2.jpg.w300h200.jpg" width="300" align="Left" /></p>
<p>America is now a country stuck on stupid, greatly because of this unholy and apocalyptic system that dooms our society. Gee, moving to a <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/01/31/senate-resolution-to-tackle-common-cores-threat-of-national-curriculum/">common core curriculum</a> has the intent to eliminate the last remnants of independent school boards. Home Schooling is also threatened as the article, <a href="http://hedua.com/blog/homeschool-common-core/">What Homeschool Parents Need to Know about the Common Core</a> argues.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One factor is the century-long effort to nationalize and standardize American education. The standardization efforts have their roots in Dewey, Cubberley, and the schools of education at Stanford and Columbia. They picked up steam in the 1960s and 1970s as the national teachers’ unions gained more power. They strengthened more when President Jimmy Carter fulfilled a promise to the NEA by creating a separate, cabinet-level Department of Education.</p>
<p>The educrats dream of a day when every student in America will receive exactly the same education, using the same textbooks and lesson plans. Those textbooks and lesson plans will, of course, be developed by the best and the brightest, who will pass them down on tablets of stone. The worker bees and drones will be programmed to follow them exactly. This is a nightmare scenario, one which anyone who believes in individual rights, local control, and federalism should oppose at every opportunity. The Common Core Standards become dangerous when they form a stepping stone which helps to move the educrats’ vision forward.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Top down control always is intended to eradicate the voice of the individual. Under a national coordinated imposition of federal funding, local school districts have become dependent upon the conditional requirements of conformity to keep the money flowing.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? From the <a href="http://batr.org/view_/090201.html">Dysfunctional Public Education Is No Accident</a> article.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Reform is no long possible. A Federal Department of Education hastens central controls for social compliance. At this point, an education free from public schools, has more value than going through the disinformation that is currently being taught. The errors that are learned in childhood are more difficult to overturn, then if they were never acquired in the first place. So what exactly is the advantage in an education under government approved instructors? If you want to reverse the decay in moral aptitude, you must find alternatives for the education of your children.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Common Core pronouncements sound so nice. In spite of this, the key question is whether their program of study teaches the principles of developing good citizens. Lest we forget, a good citizen is an independent thinking and rationally responsible trained advocate of liberty and moral values. Maintaining and expanding a structure of mindless and obedient state compliance is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Our founding fathers were distinguished, well spoken and skilled in the understanding of human nature. Today’s specimens, hatched from government schools, are chicken-livered dimwits that aspire to the lowest paradigm that a common core can establish. The miserable failure of the taxpayer collective education system is undeniable by any judicious measure. RIP before the entire nation dies.</p>

</div>
<p>In October 1944, at age eighteen, I was drafted into the U.S. army. Largely because of the “Battle of the Bulge,” my training was cut short, my furlough was halved, and I was sent overseas immediately. Upon arrival in Le Havre, France, we were quickly loaded into box cars and shipped to the front. When we got there, I was suffering increasingly severe symptoms of mononucleosis, and was sent to a hospital in Belgium. Since mononucleosis was then known as the “kissing disease,” I mailed a letter of thanks to my girlfriend.</p>
<p>By the time I left the hospital, the outfit I had trained with in Spartanburg, South Carolina, was deep inside Germany, so, despite my protests, I was placed in a “repo depot” (replacement depot). I lost interest in the units to which I was assigned, and don’t recall all of them: non-combat units were ridiculed at that time. My separation qualification record states I was mostly with Company C, 14th Infantry Regiment, during my seventeen-month stay in Germany, but I remember being transferred to other outfits also.</p>
<p>In late March or early April 1945, I was sent to guard a POW camp near Andernach along the Rhine. I had four years of high school German, so I was able to talk to the prisoners, although this was forbidden. Gradually, however, I was used as an interpreter and asked to ferret out members of the S.S. (I found none.)</p>
<p>In Andernach about 50,000 prisoners of all ages were held in an open field surrounded by barbed wire. The women were kept in a separate enclosure that I did not see until later. The men I guarded had no shelter and no blankets. Many had no coats. They slept in the mud, wet and cold, with inadequate slit trenches for excrement. It was a cold, wet spring, and their misery from exposure alone was evident.</p>
<p>Even more shocking was to see the prisoners throwing grass and weeds into a tin can containing a thin soup. They told me they did this to help ease their hunger pains. Quickly they grew emaciated. Dysentery raged, and soon they were sleeping in their own excrement, too weak and crowded to reach the slit trenches. Many were begging for food, sickening and dying before our eyes. We had ample food and supplies, but did nothing to help them, including no medical assistance.</p>
<p>Outraged, I protested to my officers and was met with hostility or bland indifference. When pressed, they explained they were under strict orders from “higher up.” No officer would dare do this to 50,000 men if he felt that it was “out of line,” leaving him open to charges. Realizing my protests were useless, I asked a friend working in the kitchen if he could slip me some extra food for the prisoners. He too said they were under strict orders to severely ration the prisoners’ food, and that these orders came from “higher up.” But he said they had more food than they knew what to do with, and would sneak me some.</p>
<p>When I threw this food over the barbed wire to the prisoners, I was caught and threatened with imprisonment. I repeated the “offense,” and one officer angrily threatened to shoot me. I assumed this was a bluff until I encountered a captain on a hill above the Rhine shooting down at a group of German civilian women with his .45 caliber pistol. When I asked, “Why?,” he mumbled, “Target practice,” and fired until his pistol was empty. I saw the women running for cover, but, at that distance, couldn’t tell if any had been hit.</p>
<p>This is when I realized I was dealing with cold-blooded killers filled with moralistic hatred. They considered the Germans subhuman and worthy of extermination; another expression of the downward spiral of racism. Articles in the G.I. newspaper, <i>Stars and Stripes</i>, played up the German concentration camps, complete with photos of emaciated bodies. This amplified our self-righteous cruelty, and made it easier to imitate behavior we were supposed to oppose. Also, I think, soldiers not exposed to combat were trying to prove how tough they were by taking it out on the prisoners and civilians.</p>
<p>These prisoners, I found out, were mostly farmers and workingmen, as simple and ignorant as many of our own troops. As time went on, more of them lapsed into a zombie-like state of listlessness, while others tried to escape in a demented or suicidal fashion, running through open fields in broad daylight towards the Rhine to quench their thirst. They were mowed down.</p>
<p>Some prisoners were as eager for cigarettes as for food, saying they took the edge off their hunger. Accordingly, enterprising G.I. “Yankee traders” were acquiring hordes of watches and rings in exchange for handfuls of cigarettes or less. When I began throwing cartons of cigarettes to the prisoners to ruin this trade, I was threatened by rank-and-file G.I.s too.</p>
<p>The only bright spot in this gloomy picture came one night when. I was put on the “graveyard shift,” from two to four a.m. Actually, there was a graveyard on the uphill side of this enclosure, not many yards away. My superiors had forgotten to give me a flashlight and I hadn’t bothered to ask for one, disgusted as I was with the whole situation by that time. It was a fairly bright night and I soon became aware of a prisoner crawling under the wires towards the graveyard. We were supposed to shoot escapees on sight, so I started to get up from the ground to warn him to get back. Suddenly I noticed another prisoner crawling from the graveyard back to the enclosure. They were risking their lives to get to the graveyard for something. I had to investigate.</p>
<p>When I entered the gloom of this shrubby, tree-shaded cemetery, I felt completely vulnerable, but somehow curiosity kept me moving. Despite my caution, I tripped over the legs of someone in a prone position. Whipping my rifle around while stumbling and trying to regain composure of mind and body, I soon was relieved I hadn’t reflexively fired. The figure sat up. Gradually, I could see the beautiful but terror-stricken face of a woman with a picnic basket nearby. German civilians were not allowed to feed, nor even come near the prisoners, so I quickly assured her I approved of what she was doing, not to be afraid, and that I would leave the graveyard to get out of the way.</p>
<p>I did so immediately and sat down, leaning against a tree at the edge of the cemetery to be inconspicuous and not frighten the prisoners. I imagined then, and still do now, what it would be like to meet a beautiful woman with a picnic basket under those conditions as a prisoner. I have never forgotten her face.</p>
<p>Eventually, more prisoners crawled back to the enclosure. I saw they were dragging food to their comrades, and could only admire their courage and devotion.</p>
<p>On May 8, V.E. Day [1945], I decided to celebrate with some prisoners I was guarding who were baking bread the other prisoners occasionally received. This group had all the bread they could eat, and shared the jovial mood generated by the end of the war. We all thought we were going home soon, a pathetic hope on their part. We were in what was to become the French zone [of occupation], where I soon would witness the brutality of the French soldiers when we transferred our prisoners to them for their slave labor camps.</p>
<p>On this day, however, we were happy.</p>
<p>As a gesture of friendliness, I emptied my rifle and stood it in the corner, even allowing them to play with it at their request. This thoroughly “broke the ice,” and soon we were singing songs we taught each other, or that I had learned in high school German class (“Du, du, liegst mir im Herzen”). Out of gratitude, they baked me a special small loaf of sweet bread, the only possible present they had left to offer. I stuffed it in my “Eisenhower jacket,” and snuck it back to my barracks, eating it when I had privacy. I have never tasted more delicious bread, nor felt a deeper sense of communion while eating it. I believe a cosmic sense of Christ (the Oneness of all Being) revealed its normally hidden presence to me on that occasion, influencing my later decision to major in philosophy and religion.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, some of our weak and sickly prisoners were marched off by French soldiers to their camp. We were riding on a truck behind this column. Temporarily, it slowed down and dropped back, perhaps because the driver was as shocked as I was. Whenever a German prisoner staggered or dropped back, he was hit on the head with a club and killed. The bodies were rolled to the side of the road to be picked up by another truck. For many, this quick death might have been preferable to slow starvation in our “killing fields.”</p>
<p>When I finally saw the German women held in a separate enclosure, I asked why we were holding them prisoner. I was told they were “camp followers,” selected as breeding stock for the S.S. to create a super-race. I spoke to some, and must say I never met a more spirited or attractive group of women. I certainly didn’t think they deserved imprisonment.</p>
<p>More and more I was used as an interpreter, and was able to prevent some particularly unfortunate arrests. One somewhat amusing incident involved an old farmer who was being dragged away by several M.P.s. I was told he had a “fancy Nazi medal,” which they showed me. Fortunately, I had a chart identifying such medals. He’d been awarded it for having five children! Perhaps his wife was somewhat relieved to get him “off her back,” but I didn’t think one of our death camps was a fair punishment for his contribution to Germany. The M.P.s agreed and released him to continue his “dirty work.”</p>
<p>Famine began to spread among the German civilians also. It was a common sight to see German women up to their elbows in our garbage cans looking for something edible — that is, if they weren’t chased away.</p>
<p>When I interviewed mayors of small towns and villages, I was told that their supply of food had been taken away by “displaced persons” (foreigners who had worked in Germany), who packed the food on trucks and drove away. When I reported this, the response was a shrug. I never saw any Red Cross at the camp or helping civilians, although their coffee and doughnut stands were available everywhere else for us. In the meantime, the Germans had to rely on the sharing of hidden stores until the next harvest.</p>
<p>Hunger made German women more “available,” but despite this, rape was prevalent and often accompanied by additional violence. In particular I remember an eighteen-year old woman who had the side of her faced smashed with a rifle butt, and was then raped by two G.I.s. Even the French complained that the rapes, looting and drunken destructiveness on the part of our troops was excessive. In Le Havre, we’d been given booklets warning us that the German soldiers had maintained a high standard of behavior with French civilians who were peaceful, and that we should do the same. In this we failed miserably.</p>
<p>“So what?” some would say. “The enemy’s atrocities were worse than ours.” It is true that I experienced only the end of the war, when we were already the victors. The German opportunity for atrocities had faded, while ours was at hand. But two wrongs don’t make a right. Rather than copying our enemy’s crimes, we should aim once and for all to break the cycle of hatred and vengeance that has plagued and distorted human history. This is why I am speaking out now, 45 years after the crime. We can never prevent individual war crimes, but we can, if enough of us speak out, influence government policy. We can reject government propaganda that depicts our enemies as subhuman and encourages the kind of outrages I witnessed. We can protest the bombing of civilian targets, which still goes on today. And we can refuse ever to condone our government’s murder of unarmed and defeated prisoners of war.</p>
<p>I realize it’s difficult for the average citizen to admit witnessing a crime of this magnitude, especially if implicated himself. Even G.I.s sympathetic to the victims were afraid to complain and get into trouble, they told me. And the danger has not ceased. Since I spoke out a few weeks ago, I have received threatening calls and had my mailbox smashed. But its been worth it. Writing about these atrocities has been a catharsis of feelings suppressed too long, a liberation, that perhaps will remind other witnesses that “the truth will make us free, have no fear.” We may even learn a supreme lesson from all this: only love can conquer all.</p>

			<p><em>“You’re not supposed to be so blind with patriotism that you cannot face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who does it or says It.”</em> – Malcolm X</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/corporateobama3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>I have been reading political commentary on <a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/">Black Agenda Report</a> (BAR) regularly of late. The site, which purveys a black leftist perspective, regularly excoriates President Obama, as well they should. BAR has become a trusted source in my quest to understand history and current events. This is the home of the real left, not the pseudo left that pervades the corporate airwaves masquerading as champions of equality. Here, no one is paying homage to Obama or calling him a liberal or progressive simply because he is a black democrat. No one is calling him a socialist, either. The political commentators at BAR hold Obama to the same standard to which they held George W. Bush and his fascist predecessors.</p>
<p align="left">Most of the self-proclaimed liberals who castigated Bush and Cheney for their neoconservative polices are giving Obama, whose polices are no less regressive or extreme than those of his precursors, a free ride. This is because the president belongs to the Democratic Party, which continues to be associated with traditional liberalism in the minds of contemporary faux progressives and liberals, rather than the neoliberalism that defines its policies.</p>
<p align="left">Those who continue to support Obama and his backsliding pro-corporate regime obviously have no conception about what classical liberalism and progressivism are. They are at least half a century behind the times.</p>
<p align="left">Although I may lack the political acumen to concisely define terms such as liberalism, progressivism, and leftist, which are somewhat subjective anyway, it is apparent to me that neoliberalism, the form of liberalism that is actually practiced by today’s Democratic Party, bears much in common with the neoconservatism that is associated with contemporary Republicans. There is nothing progressive about either ideology, and nothing in them that is beneficial to workers. To call Obama a liberal or a socialist, as so many people do, is beyond farcical. It strains one’s credulity to the breaking point.</p>
<p align="left">I distrust Barack Obama for the same reasons that I spurn George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, the Clintons, and any other war mongering capitalist. My criticism has nothing to do with race or gender. It stems from ideological differences, class conflict, and radically dissimilar values from the ruling clique.</p>
<p align="left">Among some black folk, charges of racism are leveled against any white folks who criticize the black president in the same way that charges of anti-Semitism are used against anyone who is critical of Israel’s Zionist polices of apartheid that, with the aid of the U.S., are being carried out against the Palestinians. This is not to deny the racism that is directed against the president. It is to philosophically and morally disassociate myself from any and all groups of white supremacists engaged in bigotry.</p>
<p align="left">If a policy is morally reprehensible and unjust, just people have a moral obligation to criticize it, regardless of who is responsible for formulating and enacting such policies. Every socially conscious human being has an ethical responsibility to take action against criminal government or any corporation that is harming one’s community, or for that matter, the planet.</p>
<p align="left">From my perspective, BAR and WPFW’s Jared Ball are ethically consistent and accurate in their critiques of Barack Obama and American capitalism. These venerable warriors are true leftists who do not compromise their principles for political expediency, cost them what it may.</p>
<p align="left">The virtually defunct radical left was once a formidable and organized political force in the U.S. Today’s leftists are treated like pariahs by the pseudo left and its neocon brethren. Radical leftists pose a viable threat to the established orthodoxy. Anyone who refuses to carry forth the performative role assigned to them by the dominant culture is a threat to those in power. As true combatants for justice, today’s leftwing dissidents are worthy of being associated with iconic revolutionaries like Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, and Mumia Abu Jamal, all of whom happen to be black.</p>
<p align="left">By contrast, Barack Obama, who mouths an endless stream of pseudo liberal platitudes, is an unabashed disciple of Milton Friedman and the market fundamentalism he revered. This identifies the president as a corporate fascist and thus a promoter of inequality. It allies him with America’s ruling class. Obama and his supporters should not be identified in any way, shape or form with thereal left. Whatever minutia one uses to differentiate between contemporary neoliberals and neoconservatives is akin to splitting hairs.</p>
<p align="left">The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are not mortal enemies, as portrayed in the corporate media; they are in collusion against the world’s working class and the poor. Together, they are raping and pillaging the Earth Mother and repressing workers through economic violence and imposed austerity. Like costumed wrestlers performing on television, the acrimony is not real; it is vitriolic political theater, an enthralling puppet show for diehard believers.</p>
<p align="left">We must somehow move beyond party politics, beyond the simplicity of liberal versus conservative dichotomy, beyond left against right, and see things as they really are rather than as we wish them to be.</p>
<p align="left">Voting doesn’t change anything in a system flush with corporate money. The structures that put the money into politics cannot be used to extract it. Without proportional representation or corporate money, third parties are not a viable option in state and federal elections. They are just another distraction from reality, a mild form of symbolic protest. Voting for justice does nothing to actually attain it. Direct action directly applied to a problem offers the best hope for revolutionary change.</p>
<p align="left">Conversely, political dualism keeps us fighting the wrong people. It has us believing in people and institutions that do not promote justice and do us harm. These institutions are not what they purport to be. They are at best a mirage; something that appears real but only exists in the mind of the beholder.</p>
<p align="left">Belief in the American Dream and perverted systems of power as a means to justice provides a method for directing and cajoling the masses to do the biding of the super-wealthy and all-powerful corporate state. Faith, hope, and belief in phony people and bogus institutions function as a form of mass hypnosis that keeps the people from organizing in class struggle against a common oppressor—the capitalist system.</p>
<p align="left">Despite reams of contradictory historical evidence, most people in the U.S. continue to associate democracy with capitalism. It is reckless of us to allow anyone to use these terms interchangeably without contesting them at every opportunity. Let me be clear: Democracy is the antithesis of capitalism! But capitalism is the product the U.S. government, the Pentagon, and the commercial media are marketing to us as democracy. And thus the inequality gap, the disparity between rich and poor, is growing wider rather than shrinking.</p>
<p align="left">The nemesis of all working people, regardless of where they live or their political affiliation, is capitalism and its linear, hierarchal, male-dominated power structures. This is why we must have a truthful critique of capitalism and patriarchy and create alternatives that promote the public wellbeing above corporate profits. Many promising alternatives, such as Professor Richard Wolff’s Worker Self-Directed Enterprise (<a href="http://www.democracyatwork.info/">http://www.democracyatwork.info</a>), already exist.</p>
<p align="left">When the richest and most powerful people on earth, the primary beneficiaries of capitalism, invest so many resources into demonizing and subverting the writings of one man—Karl Marx—and the various economic and philosophic alternatives to capitalism, inquisitive minds want to know why. There are elements of Marxism that makes the power elite quake in their shoes. This is what led me to read Marx years ago. I have been reading him ever since.</p>
<p align="left">Marx has helped me to comprehend why capitalists fear and loathe him. Deep down, they know that he was right. If workers understood capitalism from a Marxist perspective, not one in ten thousand would voluntarily accept their performative role in this exploitative economic system. There would be widespread conflict and social upheaval. There would be global revolution. The power elite spends trillions of dollars to maintain the façade of capitalism as a manifestation of democracy. In fact, I would argue that nothing could be more opposed to democracy than American capitalism.</p>
<p align="left">The key point to understand is that capitalism, a system based upon the ruthless exploitation and commodification of workers and the relentless rape of our Earth Mother, stifles and represses democracy. Capitalists abhor all forms of egalitarianism. Marx embraced them. The mere possibility of an empowered work force troubles the capitalist’s sleep, as did the possibility of slave rebellion, albeit it small, distress the slaveholder.</p>
<p align="left">Consider the vitriol, not to mention counter revolutionary forces that are levied against the alternatives to capitalism. What is their source? Who but wealthy capitalists fund America’s propaganda apparatus? Working people in the U.S. are conditioned to reflexively recoil against ideas they do not understand. They are psychologically programmed to detest that which could potentially set them free. American workers are led to believe that economic servitude and wage slavery is freedom.</p>
<p align="left">Why does a government that calls itself a democracy systemically spy on its citizens? Why does it punish its whistle blowers but materially reward the vilest white-collar criminals? Why is the majority of the U.S. budget spent on funding an insatiable war machine? Why do we raise classrooms of meat puppets rather than critical thinkers and political dissidents? It is all done for the benefit of capitalists at the expense of society.</p>
<p align="left">It is by these means that capitalism survives and spreads like an aggressive malignancy to every organ of the planet. Furthermore, the majority of the wealth produced by labor is subverted to prop up the capitalist system and to indoctrinate and oppress the worker. To the detriment of us all, freethinking and critical analysis are discouraged and often reprimanded in academia and elsewhere. And thus hundreds of millions of human beings are transformed into herd animals that are led to slaughter in the military and the world’s sweat shops. We celebrate our freedom and patriotism on our march to the scalding pots, singing “God Bless America.” There is no fight in us. We go too quietly and too obediently into the good night of eternity.</p>
<p align="left">Yet, despite everything and the repressive weight of history, Americans still have a propensity to believe in myths and fairy tales. Hope and faith in phony leaders and bogus institutions keep us servile and docile. Irrational faith requires nothing from us. Delusion has become the norm because too many of us are incapable of grappling with reality. We can and must do better than capitalism or we are doomed to an ignominious fate.</p>

<p>Despite the <a title="Etymology" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEtymology&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9eL1ifXrsvUsD2aAV63VZJ8bo1A" target="_blank">origin</a> of the term from the <a title="Ancient Greek" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAncient_Greek&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKWSOqBEM_STiDHSGcy63CRb0PSQ" target="_blank">Greek</a> roots “<i>skhizein” which means</i> &#8220;to split&#8221;, schizophrenia does not imply a &#8220;multiple personality disorder.”  The term means a &#8220;splitting of mental functions.”  You might say that someone suffering from a multiple personality disorder walks around with an endless number of “distinct” persons in his or her head.  All of them compete for dominance.  All of them create chaos in that person’s mind.</p>
<p>Enter the term “multiculturalism” where multiple cultures reside in the same country.   Ultimately cultures conflict with one another via people, passions and language.</p>
<p><a title="Jonathan H. Turner" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJonathan_H._Turner&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAybeFrUyI_XN2dAjss8pQCyVqXA" target="_blank">Jonathan H. Turner</a> defines it as a conflict caused by &#8220;differences in <a title="Culture" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCulture&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGU5LgCmmlUbeyY33uAATGv63CeQA" target="_blank">cultural</a> <a title="Value (personal and cultural)" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FValue_%2528personal_and_cultural%2529&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHL73EVApyuuXGZzyCOWcWwHmyEA" target="_blank">values</a> and <a title="Belief" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBelief&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1Qmzn-yV07ZFPBVtE1wqC4w5xmA" target="_blank">beliefs</a><wbr></wbr> that place people at odds with one another&#8221;. He defines this conflict as, “One that occurs when peoples’ expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met.  They face others that possess different cultural backgrounds and different expectations.”</p>
<p>We proved that cultures don’t mix when we usurped the Native American Indians of North America.  They have not integrated into the white man’s culture whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Cultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs,” said Turner.  “Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in <a title="Politics" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPolitics&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzv_OuriiecYpuFuk8FaLbIiVqXA" target="_blank">politics</a>, particularly on a macro level.  An example of cultural conflict is <a title="Abortion debate" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbortion_debate&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqi14-tEaBI25C6NUa77NvNNHdlg" target="_blank">the debate</a> over <a title="Abortion" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbortion&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgEhH1VH7wQaZKS-rHEvmCd7_52Q" target="_blank">abortion</a>.  <a title="Ethnic cleansing" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEthnic_cleansing&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7eMSsKpDe6zXCx4kkafSpz_X8Kg" target="_blank">Ethnic cleansing</a> is another extreme example of cultural conflict. Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict.”</p>
<p>The African-Americans versus European-American conflict rages in the United States without pause from 1776 to 2013.  No amount of laws, education, forced integration, police or legal consequences stop racial discrimination, racial bias, racism or violence.</p>
<p>Whether in the NFL two weeks ago with one black and one white player fighting over race or the Zimmerman-Martin killing or voting a black president into the White House—Americans fail to resolve the racial-cultural divide that permeates every city in America where blacks, Mexicans and whites mix.</p>
<p>Today, blacks in big cities practice a new game where they “Knockout” a white person from behind with a hammer or 2&#215;4 board.  “Black flash mobs” run around major US cities looting stores and killing white people. They take a video of their kills and boast on You Tube.  Much the same occurred in the 80s, 90s and last decade with blacks car- jacking whites in Detroit, Michigan at stoplights.  Whites fled to the tune of over 1.0 million over 20 years. Their flight dropped Detroit from 1.85 million to its current 680,000 today—over 90 percent Arabic-Black minority.</p>
<p>Illegal alien Mexican migrants attempt to fight their way into America demanding we suspend our laws in favor of legalizing their lawlessness. As their numbers continue to grow, we can expect violent demonstrations. They demand Americans speak Spanish and wherever Mexicans command dominant numbers, Americans must teach Mexican kids in Spanish. Mexican racism runs deep and virulent.</p>
<p>If you look at Norway, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Belgium and Holland today, you see the results of multiculturalism turning their countries into “Schizophrenic societies.”  All of them see major crime waves of rapes, murders, shoplifting, bursting prisons, schools in chaos, enclaving of entire cities into cultural ghettos, language changes, cultural changes and loss of societal cohesiveness.  Belgium, once all-European, will become an Islamic caliphate within four decades.  Its culture and language face ultimate displacement by its Islamic immigrants.</p>
<p>Of special note, Swedish women can no longer walk down the streets of Stockholm by themselves for fear of being accosted, raped or murdered by Muslim immigrant males.  Same in Norway and in France where Muslims dominate a specific enclave!</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, Holland and France face similar fates.</p>
<p>Within 37 years, the United States faces becoming a “Schizophrenic Society” with 100 million immigrants streaming into its borders from 150 countries around the world.  Some cultures will create and harbor their own in ghettos like the ones they fled.  Others will compete for dominance like the Islamic immigrants as they follow the prime directive of their Koran—“You must convert or kill all non-believers, especially the Jews.”</p>
<p>As this series winds down as to what America will look like in 2050, you cannot help but cringe at the loss of your own language, culture and way of life.  You may be sickened at what you see already occurring across America in Mexican ghettoes like Los Angeles, Houston and along the border with “colonias” that reek of third world misery.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to see our country turned into a schizophrenic cultural quagmire, call Speaker of the House John Boehner at <a href="tel:1%20202%20225%200600" target="_blank">1 202 225 0600</a>:</p>
<p>“Mr. Boehner, I understand that S744 doubles legal immigration from its current 1.0 million annually to 2.0 million while giving amnesty to 12 to 20 million illegal migrants. Do you understand that such an amnesty would flood America with over 100 million immigrants by 2050—a scant 37 years from now. How will we be able to water, house, work, feed, educate, medicate and care for that many people when we already suffer 48 million Americans who cannot secure jobs and live on food stamps? How will we maintain our environment and standard of living in light of those numbers. As an American citizen, I demand that you reduce all immigration to less than 100,000 annually and enforce the laws on the books to arrest, prosecute and jail employers of illegal migrants. That will help illegal migrants to go home on their own dime when they don’t have a job. Our own unemployed citizens can take those jobs at a living wage.”</p>
<p>Also: call your own U.S. Senators and leave the same message.</p>

<p><strong>A Book Review&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Max Blumenthal’s Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel is a good read: A personal journey  of a young  American righteous Jew who finds  plenty of faults in other Jews in general and in The Jewish State in particular.</p>
<p>Blumenthal is a very good writer, his flow is fantastic. His delivery is overwhelmingly juicy on the verge of gossipy. He doesn’t pretend to be objective, precise or accurate. In the Kindle version I couldn’t find a single reference for any of the many quotes in the book. But who cares &#8211; precision and accuracy are not well appreciated within the contemporary progressive milieu. But this lack is far from posing a problem. It actually contributes to chronicle the journalistic account of contemporary Israel.     </p>
<p>Blumenthal’s book is a powerful expose of Israeli exceptionalism, deep and sinister Goy hatred, Judeo-centric bigotry, supremacy and a vast collective lack of ethical awareness.  But Blumenthal fails to ask the most important question: why is the Jewish State so bad? Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel suffers from an acute deficiency of theoretical and ideological depth or understanding. Through the entire book Blumenthal fails to present a single valid argument that explains why the  Jewish State is such a horrid place. And if Zionism and the Jewish State are as bad as Blumenthal suggests, how is it possible that Zionism has become the political voice for the vast majority of world Jewry?</p>
<p>Blumenthal is entrenched within a restricted cliched progressive terminological trap.  His universe is split by a set of binary oppositions:  Zionist is bad / the ‘anti’ is good, ‘Right’ is vile /  ‘Left’ is kosher. Colonialism is there to tag everything in a horrid light. When he runs out of superlatives, he pulls ‘Fascism’ out of the box.</p>
<p>But the truth of the matter is that this binary tagging procedure fails to explain a single thing. Zionism is not a colonial movement. Colonialism is defined as a clear material exchange between a ‘mother state’ and a ‘settler state.’ In the case of Israel and Zionism, we can clearly point at the ‘settlers’ but it is far from obvious who the ‘mother’ is. Right-wing ideology may be horrid, but in the history of Israel and Zionism it is actually the Leftist Zionists and Israelis who committed the most vile atrocities against the indigenous Palestinians. Fascism also doesn’t explain Israeli behaviour. If anything it is the resemblance with Nazism that may explain the biological determinist philosophy that drives israeli Judeo-centric politics and culture.</p>
<p>So what is it that motivates Blumenthal to write such an extended work that actually teaches us very little about the core problems? I believe that Blumenthal’s agenda is very simple: he is desperate to defame Israel and Zionism, which is totally reasonable, yet he also tries to vindicate the Jews as a collective, pointing at a few sporadic good Jews. This manipulative and dated strategy had been successful for a while, but it hardly helped the Palestinians. If anything, it  diverted attention from the vast tribal operation that drives Israel, Zionism, as well as the Jewish dissidence.</p>
<p>In recent years it has become rather clear that the Jewish organisations that rally for Palestinians and their rights are, sadly enough, as exclusive and racially driven as the Jewish State which they allegedly oppose. I assume that no one expects a Palestinian to become the chairman of the pro-Palestinian Jewish Voice For Peace for the same reason that we are not going to see an Israeli Palestinian becoming Israel’s Prime Minister any time soon. The ‘progressive’ Jews-only organisations are, like Blumenthal, primarily dedicated to the fight against ‘anti-semitism’ and in practice are very quick to label legitimate criticism of Jewish politics and power as ‘anti-Jewish racism.’  In short, as Jeff Blankfort suggested recently, “Jewish anti Zionism  has shown itself, for the most part, not to be a solution, but a continuation of the problem.”</p>
<p>Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel came under a lot of criticism. Zionist book burners of all sorts discredited the book and its author. Nevertheless, Blumenthal may have learned the necessary lesson. Being himself a devoted book burner, he must know by now  that It is actually the detractors who often transform a controversial text into a commercial success.  </p>
<p>I really want Blumenthal’s book to succeed and be read widely.  Being a theoretician, I do not have the time for any kind of field work. I establish a conceptual and intellectual framework with the hope that some would find the energy, the time and the the funds to gather the necessary evidence to support my theses.  Whether Blumenthal understands it or not, this is exactly what he did in his latest book. He brilliantly though unwittingly managed to produce a pretty impressive journalistic account in support of my criticism of Jewish identity politics and tribal supremacy.</p>

Gilad Atzmon was born in Israel in 1963 and had his musical training at the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem (Composition and Jazz). As a multi-instrumentalist he plays Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Baritone Saxes, Clarinet and Flutes. His album Exile was the BBC jazz album of the year in 2003. He has been described by John Lewis on the Guardian as the “hardest-gigging man in British jazz&#8221;. His albums, of which he has recorded nine to date, often explore political themes and the music of the Middle East.</em></p>
<p><em>Until 1994 he was a producer-arranger for various Israeli Dance &amp; Rock Projects, performing in Europe and the USA playing ethnic music as well as R&amp;R and Jazz.</em></p>
<p><em>Coming to the UK in 1994, Atzmon recovered an interest in playing the music of the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe that had been in the back of his mind for years. In 2000 he founded the Orient House Ensemble in London and started re-defining his own roots in the light of his emerging political awareness. Since then the Orient House Ensemble has toured all over the world. The Ensemble includes Eddie Hick on Drums, Yaron Stavi on Bass and Frank Harrison on piano &amp; electronics.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, being a prolific writer, Atzmon&#8217;s essays are widely published. His novels &#8216;Guide to the perplexed&#8217; and &#8216;My One And Only Love&#8217; have been translated into 24 languages.</em></p>

<p>The establishment has an entrenched interest in convincing the public that their vote in elections actually decides who is selected for public office. That same power elite runs and controls both Republican and Democratic political parties. Only a neophyte or a delusional idealist believes that the voting cycle reflects the will of the people. When reform candidates engage in the primary process, hoping to win the nomination from either of the two major parties, they face the stark reality that playing ball with the money bundlers means obeying the directives of masters of the universe. These overlords own politicians, especially those who continue in office by winning predetermined elections.</p>
<p>Democracy as expressed by the ballot box is a fairy tale. Anyone with experience within the Tweedledum and Tweedledee party organizations, understands that the comic book characters, who populate the ranks of politics just want to become a Mini-Me version of &#8220;Boss&#8221; Tweed.</p>
<p>Dispensing the fruits of power and patronage, while fostering the crony corporatist culture, is integral to maintaining the levers of political administration over a society of inconsequential serfs. When people’s frustration mounts, and party leadership blocks even modest attempts of populist reform, voting participation declines.</p>
<p>The GOP once was described, as Rockefeller or Country Club Republicans, is really a deranged asylum of NeoCons whose primary purpose is to purge genuine conservatives and libertarians from their ranks. A party that would nominate a <a href="http://batr.org/view_/092501.html">John McCain</a> for President and continue to support him in Senate elections is not worthy of trust. Written in 2004, <a href="http://batr.org/wrack/031404.html">John McCain: The Man Who Would Be President</a> sums up the dilemma.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;McCain’s a full fledged phony without an ounce of conservative values running in his veins. Bush has proven himself to be a fraud and the tool of the NeoCons. This election is a charade of a sham called democracy. There are no surprises left, only the substitution of a name; while the same policies remain. Spell it Bush or McCain; but don’t use the designation conservative. Kerry is Bush’s brother, in the only society that selects those who are granted the nominations. McCain can only settle for second place, in service of the powers, that host the parlor game &#8211; picking a President.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Now that the New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is the toast of the town, the praises and speculation begins. <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/2013/1106/Chris-Christie-landslide-Template-for-a-Republican-presidential-win-in-2016-video">Chris Christie landslide</a>: Template for a Republican presidential win in 2016? &#8220;The governor won an impressive 57 percent of women and took a majority of Latino voters. He even garnered 21 percent of black voters – a significant inroad for a Republican. He also won nearly half of union voters and those under the age of 30.&#8221;</p>
<p>The press would have you believe that the next Republican candidate for President needs to adopt a &#8220;political correctness&#8221; love fest to be elected. Please . . . dump on the Tea Party and disparage traditional conservatives is no formula for any politicians who deserves support.</p>
<p><a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/103110.html">That Republican 2010 Landslide and What It Means</a> concludes.&#8221;The Republican Party’s attempt to co-opt the spontaneous spirit of the Tea Party geneses illustrates the panic that both entrenched parties have from a true populist movement. The mind dead voters who continually vote for the lesser of two evils, or adhere to the squishy William Buckley rule guarantee perpetual servitude. &#8220;The <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_091410/content/01125106.guest.html">Buckley Rule</a> is, ostensibly, that you vote for the most electable conservative option (in the primary) against a Democrat in November&#8221;.</p>
<p>The quest for that illusory electability is the trouble with every recent election. When will a true conservative/libertarian populist win the nomination? The apparent answer is never in a party of RINO’s and establishment gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Where can a true believer turn? That leaves Hillary Clinton as the apparent frontrunner nominee for the Democrats. The problem with that presumption is that she got the cold shoulder in 2008 in favor of <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/081510.html">Barry Soetoro</a>, the CIA’s Manchurian Candidate. The Republicans are supposed to be the party of next in line Presidential torch carriers.</p>
<p><img alt="Friday-blog-entry.gif" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/Friday-blog-entry.gif" width="300" align="Left" /></p>
<p>So why would the Democrats want HilLAIRy as their, <a href="http://batr.org/wrack/120105.html">Woman of the Year, or is it?</a> The obvious appeal does not go unnoticed. &#8220;All you have to do is look under the dress and you will find the stuff that dreams are made from. Hillary is a man’s woman that appeals to the trendy tender gender on both coasts. She’s has a lock on the fear factor and will be the survivor of all the village people.&#8221;What better way to succeed Obama, the beyond race President, with a legendary bisexual voice, who will distribute her racism against white rural America as a condition of perpetuating the multicultural collectivism, which is so necessary for the total destruction of traditional values.</p>
<p>Just how well did all those underprivileged minorities do under Barack Hussein Obama? Surely, a first female President Clinton would add to such striking gains in the quality of life and standard of government dependency income.</p>
<p>All this Great Society II would make the LBJ administration look like spendthrifts.</p>
<p>The people, all the people no matter their race, ethnicity or social identity are not benefiting from a New World Order economy and political authoritarianism. Yet, with each election cycle the grip of both outlaw parties continue to expand their extortion policies. Every ten years the gerrymandering of redistricting divides the territory so that the spoils will continue to be shared.</p>
<p>How dumb are the electorate to allow this corrupt process to continue? Inevitably, stupidity knows no bounds. <a href="http://batr.org/view_/050401.html">The Meaning of Third Parties in America</a> describes the dilemma.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If elections are an expression of consent, why is turn out so low for Third Parties? And if discontent was heightened, why are there not more Third Parties? The answer lies in the election returns. The fact that a majority of eligible voters no long take part in the process speaks volumes of their support. The public is stating their choice loud and clear: &#8220;NONE of the ABOVE&#8221;. This is the Third Party that wins the election. When the public deems that there is no &#8216;real&#8217; difference between the two parties and that their self-interests cannot be furthered with their vote, the electoral system breaks down. Yes, the public is frustrated; but they conclude that their vote will never, effectively, change the status quo among the choices that are available. Their lack of participation, should not be misread as satisfaction for the current condition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The misuse of power by both parties illustrates the breakdown in the two tier party system. Having twins with different spots only means that the look of the predator will camouflage their direction for the kill. The <a href="http://batr.org/twins/id37.html">Third Parties</a> segment on &#8220;Dueling Twins&#8221; reminds the nature of the feeding frenzy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The duopoly rivalry that emerged over the centuries, grew from the reality of being &#8216;in or out&#8217; of power, more than deep seeded ideological principles. For in its bare raw brute reality, politics is about power. How you get it, what you do when you have it, and how you keep it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="Cartoon_IRS_Revenge_1.gif" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/Cartoon_IRS_Revenge_1.gif" width="300" align="Right" /></p>
<p>When the Obama administration targets conservative Christian groups with IRS retribution, progressive ideologues remain silent. Protecting civil liberties only apply for the faithful of the congregation of state worship.</p>
<p>In addition, when the RINO’s mark patriotic groups and activist individuals for banishment from the ranks of the loyal opposition within their own party, they serve the masters of the same establishment that want a pervasive police state.</p>
<p>U.S. Elections are all too often a joke. The election commissions that administer the ballot process are nothing but extensions of the two corrupt parties.</p>
<p>What if a real grassroots national movement emerged that supersedes all ideology with a singular purpose – remove all careerist &#8220;pols&#8221; from office. Forget about the phony <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/121910.html">No Labels</a> effort to diffuse popular disgust. The solution is to attract the very citizens who NEVER vote in elections.A national campaign – No Confidence – would be the clear message that the arrogant confidence game crooks could understand.</p>
<p>Term limits will never be voted upon much less adopted until the entire nation strikes against the establishment with a unified proclamation of revolt.</p>
<p>The organization <a href="http://grassfire.com/">Grassfire</a> urges that people need to confront the system. Time is short and if the following scandals are allowed to be swept under the rug, the candidates in 2014 and 2016 will just continue with their lying ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>1. &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221;</p>
<p>2. The deadly Benghazi attacks</p>
<p>3. The IRS targeting of Tea Party Americans</p>
<p>4. The NSA security breaches</p>
<p>5. The truth about ObamaCare</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Populism requires citizen involvement. Elections are meaningless without active accountability.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/10/18/11527/citizens-united-decision-and-why-it-matters">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> decision, corporations and labor unions can spend as much as they want to convince people to vote for or against a candidate. With all this money going into media campaigns between sibling spotted leopards, the public never gets to choose honest and transformational constitutional candidates. A vote for a Third Party aspirant is never a waste. Consent for RepubliCANTS and DemocRATS is idiotic.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/jean-raspail-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/jean-raspail-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Forty years after publishing his prophetic dystopia Jean Raspail is still with us, ever more resigned that our civilization is on the “road to disappearance.” As he explained in an interview <a href="http://www.valeursactuelles.com/jean-raspail-%E2%80%9Cnotre-civilisation-train-dispara%C3%AEtre%E2%80%9D20131023.html">published in <i>Valeurs Actuelles</i> on October 25</a> (transl. by ST), he has no desire to join the big circle of intellectuals who spend their time debating immigration because, in his view, such talk is useless:</p>
<p>The people already intuitively know that France, as our ancestors shaped her over the centuries, is on the road to disappearance. The audience is being kept amused by endless talk about immigration, but the final truth is never stated. Furthermore, that truth is unsayable, as my friend Jean Cau had noted, because whoever says it is immediately hounded, condemned, and then rejected. Richard Millet came close to that truth, and just look what happened to him!</p>
<p>(Prolific French author Richard Millet caused <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mkv1ZFPwdg">a scandal</a> August 2012 by publishing a pamphlet, “In Literary Praise of Anders Breivik,” in which he argued that the mass killer was the product of an ideological-racial divide caused by immigration from outside Europe, and that Norway “deserved” him. To Millet, “what one calls literature” is no longer anything but “the hedonistic face of a nihilism of which anti-racism is the terrorist branch,” with most contemporary writers acting as its “henchmen” and “sycophants.” Millet had to step down as editor with France’s top publisher Gallimard following an outcry over his publication. It was branded “a fascist pamphlet that is a disgrace to literature” in an open letter to <i>Le Monde</i> signed by 120 writers.).</p>
<p>Raspail is particularly upset by the conspiracy of silence which is all-pervasive among the elite, starting with politicians. They pretend in public that all is well, but behind closed doors acknowledge the existence of the problem of immigration and identity:</p>
<p>On that subject I have several revealing letters from leading politicians on the Left, as well as those on the Right, to whom I sent the Camp of the Saints. “But you understand: it cannot be said&#8230;” Those people have a double language, a double conscience. I do not know how they do it! The trouble is, the people know that things are being hidden from them. Tens of millions of people today do not subscribe to the official discourse on immigration. They do not believe that it is “an opportunity for France.” Reality keeps imposing itself on them, on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Raspail is adamant that assimilation of immigrants is not possible, that the model of integration is unworkable. Even if a few more illegal immigrants are expelled and a few more foreigners are integrated, says he, the overall numbers will go on growing—and nothing will change in the fundamental problem: the progressive invasion of France and Europe by countless Third World multitudes.</p>
<p>I am not a prophet, but you see clearly the fragility of these countries, where unbearable poverty grows ceaselessly alongside indecent wealth. Those people do not turn to their governments to protest because they expect nothing of those governments. They turn to us and arrive in Europe in boats, in ever larger numbers, today in Lampedusa, tomorrow elsewhere. Nothing deters them. Thanks to the demographic curve, by the 2050s the number of young indigenous French will equal that of young foreigners in France. Many will be naturalized, which does not mean that they will have become French. I am not saying they are bad people, but “naturalizations on paper” are not naturalizations of the heart. I cannot consider them my compatriots. We need to drastically toughen the law, as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>There are only two ways to deal with immigrants, Raspail says. “Either we accommodate them, and France—her culture, her civilization—will be eradicated without so much as a funeral. In my view, that is what is going to happen. Or we do not accommodate them at all, which means we stop sanctifying the Other and rediscover our neighbors.”</p>
<p>This would mean that we eventually cease paying heed to those “Christian ideas gone mad,” as Chesterton called them, or to those depraved human rights, and that we take the indispensable measures to protect ourselves collectively, without appeal, to avoid the dissolution of our country into a general race-blending mélange. I see no other solution. I travelled a lot in my youth. All peoples are fascinating, but when you mix them too much, animosity becomes far more prevalent than sympathy. <i>Métissage</i> is never peaceful. It is a dangerous utopia. Just look at South Africa!</p>
<p>Raspail accepts that “at the point where we are now,” those necessary measures would inevitably be “very coercive.” He does not believe this will happen, however, and doesn’t see anyone who has the courage and the “balance of the soul” to do what is needed. “The supporters of immigration are not more charitable than I,” Raspail insists. “There probably isn’t a single one who intends to welcome one of these unfortunates into his home,” but what we have is “an emotional pretense, an irresponsible maelstrom that will swallow us.”</p>
<p>In his view, there may be a temporary alternative to the choice between submission and coercion, and that is the establishment of compact indigenous communities. The flight of the French from majority immigrant areas, as well as the mass protests against homosexual marriage legislation, herald a new form of communitarianism and indicate that millions of French people will resist the “change of civilizations” promised by the Left. Rival communitarianisms will be reinforced by mutual animosity, which will end in extremely severe confrontations.</p>
<p>Raspail does not believe in a sudden and unexpected revival. “It would require an epic spirit, an appreciation of a sublime destiny… It would require people to still believe in their country. I don’t see many of them left.” The revival would require a thorough reform of state education and the media, to deny any platform to the teachers and journalists who are serving the enemy:</p>
<p>We have removed the sacred from the idea of the nation, the exercise of power, the past of the country. We have created cracks in the statue of France, we have disfigured it (especially the Left!) to the point where nothing inspires respect any more. The power of the false ideas disseminated by the state education system and the media is boundless. But as for me, I have lived in France for 1500 years, I am content with what is mine, and I have no desire for that to change&#8230;</p>
