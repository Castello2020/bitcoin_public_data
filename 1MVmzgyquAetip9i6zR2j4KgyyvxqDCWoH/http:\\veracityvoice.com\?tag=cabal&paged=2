<p>What is more frightening, then the loss of your money. Since most people have, some meager amount held in some form of a financial institution, the prospect of the banksters&#8217; cabal placing a charge against your account for the mere privilege of maintaining a deposit, is horrible. The Business Insider warns, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/in-the-future-you-may-have-to-pay-the-bank-to-hold-your-money-2013-11">In The Future, You May Have To Pay The Bank To Hold Your Money</a>, and raises a very dreadful prospect.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In recent weeks, economists have discussed the idea of how to implement a negative interest rate while preventing people from hoarding paper currency. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/electronic-currency-2013-11">Economist Miles Kimball</a> has discussed creating an electronic currency and having an exchange rate between it and dollar bills. Others have discussed going cashless and eliminating paper currency altogether.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Negative interest rates simply mean it will cost you, in fees or service charges, to hold money in banking accounts. Examine Professor Kimball’s ivory tower justification for seizing the value and purchasing power of your savings.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;University of Michigan economist <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/electronic-currency-2013-11">Miles Kimball</a> has <a href="http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/50888412664/a-minimalist-implementation-of-electronic-money">developed a theoretical solution</a> to this problem in the form of an electronic currency that would allow the Fed to bring nominal rates below zero to combat recessions. He&#8217;s been presenting his plan to different economists and central bankers around the world. Kimball has also <a href="http://qz.com/110378/three-big-questions-for-larry-summers-janet-yellen-and-anyone-else-who-wants-to-head-the-fed/">written repeatedly</a> about it and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/18/can-we-get-rid-of-inflation-and-recessions-forever/">was recently interviewed by Wonkblog&#8217;s Dylan Matthews</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now dig deep into the mind of a mentally ill pseudo intellectual to see just how far from rational money policy such monetary eggheads go to provide cover for the fractional reserve central bankers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we repealed the &#8220;zero lower bound&#8221; that prevents interest rates from going below zero, there would be no need to rely on the large scale purchases of long-term government debt that are a mainstay of &#8220;quantitative easing,&#8221; the quasi-promises of zero interest rates for years and years that go by the name of &#8220;forward guidance,&#8221; or inflation to make those zero rates more potent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This threat is a continuation from the initial trial balloon that appeared in the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b1d409d0-5399-11e3-b425-00144feabdc0.html">Financial Times</a>. A video rant about, <a href="http://youtu.be/DMSCI7QvxxA">Banks to Start Charging You on Deposits</a>, goes ballistic with outrage that the money-centered banks are emboldened as to telegraph their intentions of raiding the nest egg savings of depositors. While the justifiable emotion is understandable for a beleaguered public, the economic aftermaths of interjecting massive QE reserves is explained well by <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-11-24/banks-warn-fed-they-may-have-start-charging-depositors">Zerohedge</a>in recent reports with the accompanied chart.</p>
<div>
<img alt="TotalLoansDepositsAndReserves_0.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/TotalLoansDepositsAndReserves_0.jpg" width="585"  /></p>
</div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Furthermore, contrary to what the hypocrite banker said that &#8220;<em>the danger is that banks are pushed into riskier assets to find yield</em>&#8220;, <strong>banks are already in the riskiest assets</strong>: just look at what JPM was doing with its hundreds of billions in excess deposits, which originated as Fed reserves on its books &#8211; we explained the process of how the Fed&#8217;s reserves are used to push the market higher most recently in &#8220;<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-22/what-shadow-banking-can-tell-us-about-feds-exit-path-dead-end">What Shadow Banking Can Tell Us About The Fed&#8217;s &#8220;Exit-Path&#8221; Dead End</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the real danger is, is that once the Fed lowers IOER and there is a massive outflow of deposits, that banks which have used the excess deposits as initial margin and collateral on marginable securities to chase risk to record highs (as JPM&#8217;s CIO explicitly and undisputedly did) that there would be an avalanche of selling once the negative rate deposit outflow tsunami hit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hence, this move to prepare the bank customer for another hosing by imposing negative rates actually is a desperate attempt to keep the derivative &#8220;day of reckoning&#8221; from hitting. This strategy will not work. In the Negotium article, <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/020613.html">Low Interest Rates Impoverish Savers</a>, makes the point: &#8220;Designed lowering of our standard of living is visible at every turn. The money-centered banks recapitalized their balance sheets at the expense of the passbook accounts customers.&#8221;With the expectation that bank accounts will actually experience debit fees for parking money will result in a massive outflow of capital. Where will the money go? Will the banks allow the return of your deposits in cash or will they impose significant costs and delay withdrawals?</p>
<p>Consider that under a banking system, which automatically reduces your balances, the acceleration of stripping your net worth goes into high gear. No sane individual would accept this theft willingly. However, the transition to a cashless economy might well inflict a call back of cash (Federal Reserve Notes) in circulation for an enforced substitute legal tender. Or else some variation of the &#8220;killer&#8221; Kimball electronic compulsory account may be imposed under strict governmental supervision.</p>
<p>Under such a circumstance, the mandatory medium of exchange strips all personal ownership from the individual. Money, in whatever form it takes, no longer will be your own property.</p>
<p>Negative interest rates institutionalize systemic inflation into every transaction. Throughout history, usury is condemned for charging interest on lending. What term should be used for paying no interest on capital saved? Anthony Migchels argues in <a href="http://henrymakow.com/2013/04/We-Forge-Our-Chains-With-Usury.html">Our Chains are Forged by Usury</a>, that the objective is to create an interest-free money supply. Much like the Kimball electronic currency, the Migchels alternative resides in his own twisted hermitage, read accordingly.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The problem is not the creation of money! Quite the opposite: it&#8217;s marvelous that we never need to have a shortage of money. The problem is when the bookkeeper starts raping the debitor with interest for no other reason than the associated minus.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While debt is the central issue in all financial bubbles, the solution is not to destroy wealth creation through capital saving. Until a universal model of wizardry or alchemy is adopted that creates a stable store of value, independent from work, ingenuity or greed; expectations of an interest free currency are pipe dreams.</p>
<p>The benefits from negative interest rates all go to the banksters. The borrower never sees FREE interest loans, nor does the saver earn a fair rate of return. The maxim remains, <em>Those with the Gold, Make the Rules</em>, is no different in the age of the New World Order of central banking. Starving the saver is negative for the rest of us.</p>

			<p><img alt="dumbestgeneration.JPG" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/dumbestgeneration.JPG" width="180" />With the death of the American Republic, the headstone sums up the epitaph &#8211; stuck on stupid. People celebrate a &#8220;Politically Correct&#8221; mixed-race president as leader for a society of multiracial special interest groups as the maturing of the country. Very few writers describe the ways diverse and culturally conflicting factions clash with traditional values and tested institutions because any serious discussion, automatically presumes to be racist. Such an adolescent and narrow-minded attitude, surrenders to the forces of anti-intellectualism. It is time to liberate the fabricated guilt and face up to the certainty that our nation is a declared SOS zone.Another media induced taboo, if you want to be part of polite society, is to criticize the public for their lack of understanding or backbone. The term sheeple, derogatory in nature, smacks of a countercultural assault on prevailing and acceptable attitudes. The irony is that such current middle-of-the-road viewpoints are wholly contradictions from our moral and principled heritage.</p>
<p>Activist Brandon Smith depicts the situation in his article, <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19241">You Should Feel Sorry For Sheeple; Here’s Why</a>. &#8220;The goal is to give sheeple comfort that they are &#8220;normal&#8221; and that anyone who steps outside the bounds of the mainstream is &#8220;abnormal&#8221; and a welcome target for the collective.&#8221; He goes on to elaborate the pollution from breathing the rarefied air of the ignorant.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sheeple Are Nothing Without The Collective</li>
<li>Sheeple Need Constant Approval From Others</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sheeple Are Incapable Of Original Creativity</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sheeple Have No Passion</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sheeple Are Useless</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sheeple Are Easily Forgotten</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://batr.org/gulag/012203.html">American Denial</a> is a disease that afflicts all political persuasions, but is severely acute in the feeble minds of &#8220;Great Society&#8221; true believers. For the uneducated pupils of government schools, the youthful appeal of grand public solutions under the velvet hand of bureaucratic guidance, are seldom tempered with the harsh reality of the inevitable political deceit. Obamacare should be a tangible teaching experience, but for the social liberal and the bleeding heart Democrats, admitting that the <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/081510.html">Barry Soetoro</a> is a habitual liar is just too much to ask. Add in the helpless dependent welfare constituency and you get a congregation of chumps, who cannot even admit that their plight is worse off under the president, who would be king.</p>
<p>The reason why social collectivism is accepted so readily stems from the construct that government pays the bills, for all the establishment whores, who administer, enforce and expand the parasite society.</p>
<p>Forgotten and never admitted is the fact that the collection of taxes is an act of forced extortion. Likewise, mandatory health care coverage, paid by a relatively healthy youth generation to support an aging and ailing population, is pure theft.</p>
<p>Yet, the crazed and dazed Obama cheerleaders continue to act as propaganda props in a surreal adaptation of the theater of the absurd. You can just envision Forest Gump &#8220;<em>stupid is as stupid does</em>&#8220;, but none of these Obama brain surgeons ever hear or got the message.</p>
<p>For the remnant of the sane and rational, such as the authentic Tea Party grassroots, demonizing true patriots is a fun sport for the Statist sympathizers, directed at their movement.</p>
<p><img alt="thoreau.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/thoreau.jpg" width="180"  /></p>
<p><a href="http://batr.org/solitary/112805.html">Henry David Thoreau</a> wrote about lives of quiet desperation. Today our entire society’s desperate condition hardly moves the sheeple. Their reliance, based upon a delusional perspective that they &#8220;cannot survive without the system, no one can survive without the system&#8221;, keeps the Ponzi scheme going.Without moral principles and ethical standards, only despondency and despair are predictable. Breaking down the will of the people to resist the systemic destruction of the cherished tenets of Western Civilization is the end game objective of progressive governance.</p>
<p>There is no serious loyal opposition coming out of the NeoCon Republican Party. The SOS alert has gone out for decades, much to the frustration of solid God-fearing Americans. However, the march towards complete authoritarianism is uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Only a citizen uprising revolt and an acceptance of <a href="http://batr.org/verity/id12.html">civil disobedience</a> <a href="http://batr.org/verity/id11.html">dissent</a> has a chance to reverse the perils of government by Pharisee and Scribes regulation. Bureaucracies seldom end and never do voluntarily. Notwithstanding the <em>Sheeple</em> resignation, the real enemy is known to anyone with a command of history and current affairs. What is lacking is the will to act. The rest of the exploited must join in or move out of the way.</p>
<p>The system is only as powerful as apathy allows. Non-compliance stops <a href="http://batr.org/despotism.html">despotism</a> with implosion. The technocratic organism, that challenges the rational basis of civilized conduct, with situation ethics of relative conditionality, is poison.</p>
<p>Hopelessness exists when people accept benign servitude. A sure sign of an establishment toady appears, when a blanket denunciation of non-violent resistance to a corrupt system is the only response offered. Read comments from the government trolls who populate the web, with the assignment to discredit any patriotic movement or truth to power advocate.Breaking the bondage of a peer pressure, Stuck on Stupid attitude, may seem to some as a courageous deed. Then again, what is more natural then the desire to be a free and honorable person? Only the corruptible and depraved will answer in the negative.</p>
<p>The Obama administration is the standing joke of late night ridicule. When will community distain for the district of criminals materialize into a daily pattern of defiance? The nation deserves a concerted confrontation against the internal traitors. True American Patriots, targeted for extinction are on notice. Only a country of dullards and spineless sycophants keep the system afloat. A determined and dedicated band of brothers and sisters, who are willing to bring to justice the globalist cabal, that runs and control the handpicked flunkies in government, can be defeated.</p>
<p>If the vow of our founders was correct, &#8220;mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our Sacred Honor&#8221;, what stops our fellow citizens from taking the same oath? How you react and engage in this struggle determines if you are a SOS fool or an esteemed national. The masters of the system are vulnerable from a mass uprising &#8211; break the denial syndrome and fight to save our country.</p>

			<p><img title="jfk 232" alt="" src="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/11/jfk-232.jpg" width="320" height="256" />The day that John Kennedy was murdered, was the day that Americans lost their country. Since that fateful day in November of 1963, our slide into tyranny has accelerated.</p>
<p>Nearly every form of tyranny which has overrun our country has its roots in the post-JFK assassination event. JFK was seemingly the last watchman on the wall against the encroaching tyranny of the newly created national surveillance security police state grid.</p>
<p>There have only been two prominent politicians who have stood up to the tyranny of the New World Order since the death of JFK. These two men would be Reagan (until he was shot by Hinckley) and Ron Paul.</p>
<h2>The Missed Opportunity Connected to the 50th Anniversary</h2>
<p>Last summer, I predicted that the upcoming 50th anniversary of JFK’s murder would awaken a whole new generation as to the tyranny that the country has fallen under and who is responsible for that tyranny. I wrongly believed that the co-conspirators, the interlocking pieces of the JFK assassination cabal, namely, David Rockefeller, the Federal Reserve, the oil companies, the military industrial complex and the CIA and their mafia assets, would be exposed with all the attention that the 50th anniversary would provide.</p>
<p>I wrongly believed that these groups  with their current and undue influence on America would also be readily identified for what they did to JFK and to the country on November 22, 1963. I further believed that today’s younger generation would easily build the bridge linking the corruption and undue influence of these 1963 groups to today’s political landscape and this would be an easy association. Unfortunately, my predictions were in error because we in the alternative media dropped the ball.</p>
<h2>The 2013 Establishment Propaganda Machine Is Rolled Out</h2>
<p><img alt="The day that JFK was murdered was the day that Rockefeller won that world's biggest lottery. " src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/11/rockefeller.jpg" width="289" height="174" /><br />
The day that JFK was murdered was the day that Rockefeller won the world’s biggest lottery.</p>
<p>With the marking of the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, there have been over 2,000 books written on the subject and countless radio and television shows devoted to the topic. This fall, the globalist news corporations have produced a rash of new JFK “investigations” which all purport to show different ways to prove that Oswald, and Oswald alone, killed John Kennedy. The new productions (e.g. National Geographic) are so bad and so faulty, that they are laughable.</p>
<h2>Media Propagandists Ignore the Government’s Final Conclusion of a Conspiracy</h2>
<p>The modern day propagandists are winning the day with regard to the control of the narrative surrounding the assassination. During the height of America’s skepticism regarding the 1964 Warren Report which stated that Lee Oswald killed John Kennedy and that he acted alone, most Americans rejected the “official explanation. What the modern day public, as well as the establishment propagandists, seem to have forgotten is that in 1977, the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that Oswald had help and JFK was killed as a result of a conspiracy. This was the final word on the subject from our government on the assassination. However, the history revisionists do not want a hint of a conspiracy because this could give birth to a modern day JFK assassination renaissance in a search for the co-conspirators who killed JFK. Once that search would begin, the descendants of the perpetrators organizations would not be able to escape public scrutiny. We in the alternative and truthful media missed a golden opportunity to wake up the country on this 50th Anniversary of JFK’s death. This fall, if we had devoted a significant amount of time and effort to covering the assassination, and we had been relentless in our efforts, the under 40 crowd would understand who their present enemies are and they would have been awakened to the present day tyranny. We allowed our voices to be drowned out by the mainstream fictional media with their new JFK cover up pieces. Sadly, we lost a golden opportunity to wake up millions of young Americans.</p>
<p>At the height of JFK conspiracy fervor in the 1970′s-1990′s, according to the Gallup Poll, as many as 80% of Americans believed that there was a conspiracy to kill JFK. Today, that number has slipped to 61% thanks in large part to the new propaganda productions which are influencing our younger Americans.</p>
<p>In the 1990′s, Oliver Stone produced JFK and Bill Kurtis and Nigel Turner produced separate investigations into the assassination (i.e. <em>The Men Who Killed Kennedy</em>). In the 1990′s, the country was spellbound by the new revelations which were also bolstered by JFK admirer, Bill Clinton, as he forced the release of millions of classified JFK documents. However, the evil empire struck back around the year, 2000, and today, you see almost nothing on TV which does not show that Oswald was acting alone.</p>
<h2>Follow the Money</h2>
<p>What is conspicuously missing in most, if not all of the accounts related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, is the fact that normal homicidal investigative strategies have not been employed by people in the government who would have the power to do so. One of the hallmark phrases in murder investigations is to “follow the money”.</p>
<p>Every year at this time, I become reflective as I wonder what America, and the rest of the world might have looked like if JFK had survived, been re-elected and served a second term as President. This year I decided to follow the money and put my thoughts on paper. So, let’s briefly follow the money.</p>
<h2>Vietnam</h2>
<p>Everybody knows that the Pentagon was frothing at the mouth to get into an armed conflict in Vietnam and/or Laos. In 1961, JFK resisted the military pressure to place troops in Laos, as he clearly instructed diplomat, Averell Harriman, to get the Laos issue settled because JFK was determined to not put combat units on the ground in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is true that JFK was manipulated by his military advisers to place troops on the ground in Vietnam but solely in the role as “combat advisers”. JFK’s anti-Vietnam war stance frequently gets overlooked because of this. However, in October 1963, a mere month before his death, JFK signed National Security Action Memorandum 263 which called for the withdrawal of 1,000 troops from Vietnam by the end of 1963 and a total withdrawal of all of the combat advisers by the end of 1965. This was one nail in the coffin of JFK.</p>
<p>JFK gave many speeches in which he clearly stated he was opposed to widening U.S. military involvement in the war. South Vietnamese leader, Diem and his brother Nhu were opposed to U.S. attempts to control his regime and Diem and his brother were adamantly opposed U.S. full-scale U.S. military involvement beyond the 16,000 combat advisers stationed in the country. On November 1, 1963, Diem and Nhu were murdered by the CIA against JFK’s wishes. Three weeks later, to the day, John F. Kennedy was murdered. Within nine months following the assassination, the LBJ administration launched the now discredited false flag event, the Gulf of Tonkin attack, and 100,000 combat troops were subsequently sent to Vietnam. Many researchers have proven the involvement of the same CIA and its Mafia connections which dates back to 1942 when the CIA was known as the OSS.</p>
<p>Knowing that the CIA and Mafia were involved in JFK’s murder, does not tell you who ordered the assassination. Any guesses on who profited the most from the Vietnam War? In radio parlance, you will have to stay tuned, the answer will be revealed at the end.</p>
<p><img title="chrysler" alt="" src="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/11/chrysler.jpg" width="259" height="194" />There were huge financial incentives for the American defense industry to participate in the murder of JFK. Yes, that would be the military industrial complex which Ike warned us about in his 1960 farewell address. In 1963, Chrysler corporation and its subsidiaries received the lion’s share of defense contracts for the war, most of which were resold to smaller corporations. Corporations such as Bell Helicopter enjoyed unparalleled growth during the height of the war. There are some interesting and notable parties which controlled the Chrysler defense industry interests in 1963.</p>
<p>Very powerful parties would have stood to have lost a lot of money had the war not materialized into a full-scale air and ground war. Who am I speaking about? All will be revealed when I connect the dots at the end. Oh by the way, the forerunner to the bid rigging and recipient of no bid contracts in Iraq, KBR, was also found guilty of the same thing in Vietnam when they were given the responsibility for building South Vietnam’s military infrastructure. The more things change, the more they do stay the same.</p>
<h2>Making Enemies with the CIA: The Bay of Pigs</h2>
<p><img title="bay of pigs" alt="" src="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/11/bay-of-pigs.jpg" width="277" height="182" />It was very well known that JFK refused to support and sanction the CIA backed Cuban refugee invasion of Cuba by refusing to allow air cover. The invasion failed and the careers of CIA Director, Dulles, and CIA Assistant Director, Cabal, were over. The proverbial line in the sand had been drawn and the CIA and JFK became mortal enemies with JFK threatening to break up the agency into a “thousand pieces”. Add to this fact, is the fact that it is well-known that the darker parts of the CIA act as mercenaries for certain groups who are not on the government payroll. Today, we would call these shadowy forces, the New World Order.</p>
<p>It is clear that with the advent of the Bay of Pigs, the brain trust for the assassination had been born and they would double down as this agency would perpetrate the cover-up, such as losing the President’s brain during the autopsy to hide the fact that JFK’s fatal head shot came from an exploding bullet, which means that Oswald’s defective Italian rifle could not have been used in the commission of the crime. Maybe this is also why LBJ had the Presidential limousine “cleaned up” immediately following the crime and the vehicle was never subsequently examined as any other crime scene would have been. LBJ should have gone to prison for obstruction of justice, but I digress. Jim Marrs and other researchers have clearly implicated the CIA as the masterminds of the assassination. I agree with Marrs, however, the CIA were not the original planners, they merely were tasked with carrying out the assassination. Regardless, the rich and famous wanted Cuba back and JFK had destroyed their plans for continued domination of the Island state.</p>
<p>Ten days following the Bay of Pigs, JFK gave his famous “secret society” speech. He is the first, and the only President to ever identify the globalists as the enemy of America and humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>If you have never listened to the speech, you should take the time to listen now, for if you do, the events of today will make a great deal more sense.</p>

<h2>The Cuban Missile Crisis</h2>
<p>Havana had become a play place for the rich and famous prior to the Castro led revolution. Upon seizing power, Castro promptly nationalized all gaming resorts and the Mafia lost their insanely high profits and the rich and famous lost their financial cut, as well as their 1960 version of Bohemian Grove. In the eyes of the rich and powerful, JFK had one more opportunity to get control over Cuba with the opportunity presented by the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<p>In 1962, in response to America’s placing offensive nuclear weapons in Turkey, close to the Soviet border, the Russians did the same in Cuba. This event brought the U.S. and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. All of JFK’s military advisers wanted to invade Cuba with ground troops. JFK opted for the ever-contracting naval blockade. Although history has proven that our invading troops would have been nuked, and that JFK pursued the correct course of action, the powerful military was now lining up against JFK. And, again, the rich and famous were thwarted in their desire to reassert control over Cuba and the defense contractors smelled the end of the gravy train.</p>
<p>Then in June of 1963, JFK gave an incredible speech at American University in which he called for the total destruction of nuclear weapons. This would have resulted in the end of the financially lucrative Cold War and the “Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war”, and a movement toward “general and complete disarmament” would have begun. A few months later JFK signed a Limited Test Ban Treaty with Nikita Khrushchev. What would happen to the profits of Raytheon and Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) if there was no cold war? The executives at the defense plants could relax because when JFK was killed, LBJ ordered the single largest increase in U.S. history and before the ink was even dry on JFK’s death certificate.</p>
<h2>America Cannot Have Peace, It Is Bad For Business</h2>
<p>Please take the time and listen to JFK’s, American University Speech, June 10, 1963, and if you understand what it means to be an American, it will bring tears to your eyes and I believe that this speech also brought a bullet to JFK’s brain, because he was poking a stick into the eyes of the military industrial complex.</p>

<h2>The Federal Reserve</h2>
<p><img title="fed" alt="" src="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/11/fed.jpg" width="225" height="225" /><br />
On June 4, 1963, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 and this accompanied the Kennedy act which was the beginning of an attempt to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to loan money, at interest, to the government. JFK was on his way of stripping the then 50 year history of fleecing the American people. In effect, JFK, by issuing 4.3 billion dollars of U.S. notes based upon silver held in reserve, JFK was going to be able to wipe away the beginnings of national debt which, today, has mortally wounded the American economy. Please take note of the fact that this event was only a little over 5 months before the assassination. When JFK was murdered, LBJ failed to continue with the program.</p>
<p>Who stood to lose the most money if the Federal Reserve had lost its stranglehold on the American economy? You would be right if you answered Chase-Manhattan Bank with its 6,389,445 shares of Federal Reserve Board Stock valued at 32.3% of the total value of stock at the Fed. Also, Citibank had a lot to lose by this move as well as they were invested in the Federal Reserve shares to the tune of  4,051,851, or 20.5% of the total value. I think you might be getting an idea who owned and/or controlled the majority interests in these two banks in 1963, but there is more before we answer the question on who profited the most from the murder of a sitting President in 1963.</p>
<h2>The Oil Depletion Allowance</h2>
<p><img title="oil 2" alt="" src="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/11/oil-2.jpg" width="279" height="180" />By the end of 1962, the robber barons which ran the oil industry estimated, that their earnings on foreign investment capital would fall to 15 percent, compared with 30 percent in 1955 if the oil depletion allowance was diminished in accordance with JFK’s proposal.</p>
<p>JFK’s attack upon the oil depletion allowance, which permitted oil producers to deduct up to 27.5% of their income as tax exempt provided the robber barons of oil a lower tax rate and a competitive business advantage, not shared by any other business interests. JFK targeted the oil depletion allowance and it was estimated the government might retain more than $300 million in tax revenue each year if the depletion allowance was reduced. Although the oil depletion allowance remained intact, due to the congressmen who were recipients of oil company campaign contributions, JFK made some very powerful enemies in the oil industry.</p>
<p>It was the oil depletion allowance which made drilling for oil a no risk venture. An oil speculator could drill five wells and if four were dry wells and only the fifth struck oil, the speculator would still make money because of tax breaks resulting from the depletion allowance deducted from owed taxes. President Kennedy pointed out the obvious when he stated “… no one industry should be permitted to obtain an undue tax advantage over all others.”</p>
<p>JFK had made an enemy out of the oil industry and its biggest tycoon, David Rockefeller with the proposal to reduce the oil depletion allowance. Do you know the two banks which controlled 53% of the Federal Reserve in 1963? Rockefeller owned the controlling interest in both banks. How about Chrysler, KBR, Bell Helicopter and the Vietnam War? You are way ahead if you said, David Rockefeller. And what about the nuclear arms race, to which the cessation of the cold war, would have meant the loss of profits to the defense industry? And who controls the defense industry? David Rockefeller. We had to have a cold war, then, for the same reasons we need a war on terror today. It is good for business and with the subsequent growth of government power which comes with war, the erosion of Constitutional liberties increases. All roads for the motivations of the JFK assassination leads to David Rockefeller as being the first mover in the plot.</p>
<p>Do I have the smoking gun that I can place in Rockefeller’s hand? The short answer is no. However, it is safe to say that the day that John Kennedy died, there were no tears shed at the Rockefeller estate.</p>
<p><img src="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/11/oswald-im-a-patsy.jpg" alt="" />If JFK’s murder had been anything but the killing of the President, any police detective worth his salt, would have followed the money trail and arrests would have been made based on the known facts. It is unacceptable that as we race toward the 50th Anniversary of the event, this next week, that not one person has been brought to justice in a court of law for the assassination of John Kennedy. Instead, a patsy, Lee Oswald,who never fired a gun on November 22, 1963, was framed and used as the patsy. And before Oswald could talk, he was murdered two days later under very mysterious circumstances. Over the next several days, I am going to publish mini-excerpts on facts about the JFK assassination which are not being covered by the MSM. My first entry will focus on how we know that Oswald did not kill JFK.</p>
<h2>Reflections on What Could Have Been</h2>
<p>If JFK would have lived, we would have not lost 58,000 lives in Vietnam. Millions of Vietnamese would have been spared. We would have an economy that is backed by silver and we would virtually have no debt because the corrupt Federal Reserve would have faded into oblivion as it did during the Andrew Jackson Administration. America would have schools that would the envy of the world, not the butt of jokes, because we would not spending money to kill people, but rather to educate, improve health care and we could have even afforded to pay off all privately held mortgages if we had only remembered the words of JFK when he reminded the faculty and staff at American University on June 10, 1963, that “We all breathe the same air…”</p>
<p>We would live in a far better place had we lived out JFK’s expressed ideals. I write this piece, not just to remind America of what we lost and how America suffered with Jack Kennedy’s death, I write this piece for those who know little of nothing of what happened on November 22, 1963, mostly young people, in order that they can know that the tyranny being imposed upon us, need not exist. There is a better way and for a moment when I listen to his speeches, I can imagine a better world.</p>

<p>No doubt you have heard about the War on Drugs, the War on Terror and the War on Happiness. However, you may not be familiar with the War on God, possibly because it would be an unpopular war to discuss publicly. By the “War on God” (definition) we mean the collection of strategies, methods and techniques which have the combined effect of preventing or seriously hampering the efforts of individuals to seek or achieve legitimate Spiritual enlightenment and the Soul’s eventual return to God.</p>
<p>The War on God is an ancient war. While the United States and other countries play an active role in this war today, they definitely did not initiate the war. If you want to use the Christian bible as a reference, you could argue that the War on God began shortly after man was created and rejected God in favor of Satan. Clearly, in some form, the War on God has existed throughout human history.</p>
<p>Today, the United States has effectively broken off diplomatic relations with God. The oligarchs who run the country never physically die and so their souls stay on Earth. Apparently, the United States actually believes that its technology, occult knowledge and black magic skills place it in a position which is superior to God.</p>
<p>We know from whistleblowers like David Morehouse that the United States sponsors and trains a cult of psychics to carry out psychic espionage (remote viewing) and also assassinations using psychic black magic techniques. According to clips of his various interviews on YouTube, it was the training in psychic assassinations which caused Morehouse to become disillusioned, quit the secret program and blow the whistle on the operation. Other countries may well operate similar programs but the details will remain unknown until someone defects and exposes them.</p>
<p>The leaders of the United States have always worshiped Satan. The United States was founded by a cult of Satanists known as the Masons and remains under control of that cult today. By rebranding their cult as a nation state, the cult created the appearance of legitimacy. Cult secrets simply transitioned to state secrets. Cult threats to kill anyone telling their secrets transitioned to the crimes of treason and espionage.</p>
<p>Nothing really changed except for the rebranding from a cult to a government. Today, essentially all members of the CIA, NSA and NASA are Masons. All US presidents have been Masons with the two exceptions of Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy who were both assassinated.</p>
<p>The term “national security” refers to the security of the cult and not to the security of the general population. The Masonic motto is <em>“If you are not one of us, you are nothing”</em>. The cult exists only to enrich itself.</p>
<div><img alt="Only two US presidents weren’t Masons, Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy. Both assassinated." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Lincoln-Kennedy.jpg" width="300" height="195" /><br />
<em>Only two US presidents weren’t Masons, Abraham Lincoln<br />
and John Kennedy. Both assassinated.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The Masons study and practice the occult. Serious study begins after they take a formal oath of allegiance to Satan at the 30th degree initiation. Basic occult knowledge is neutral and everyone who advances Spiritually learns it. However, Masons seek this knowledge to gain power and control over others as opposed to knowledge for personal advancement. This choice, commonly called the Left Hand Path, places them in opposition to the will of God.</p>
<p>If the Satanists simply wanted to sell their Souls to Satan and mind their own business, one could argue that they had that right because they had free choice. However, the situation is not that simple. The Satanic oligarchs did freely choose to worship Satan. However, they also desire a comfortable life. They don’t want to do any “grunt” work. Therefore, they have enslaved the remainder of humanity and are holding their Souls prisoner on this planet to service their needs. Therefore, if you, as an innocent Soul, ever plan to escape from this place and return to God, it is in your interest to investigate and gain an understanding of this war so that you will have an opportunity to Spiritually evolve. Otherwise, your Soul will remain a prisoner here — lifetime after lifetime — serving the Satanic overlords essentially forever.</p>
<h4>Earth Based Religions</h4>
<p>The phrase <em>Earth Based Religions</em> (definition) refers to religious schools which seek and use knowledge, including occult knowledge, to enhance their experiences during their human lifetimes as opposed to using the same knowledge to foster Spiritual development with the ultimate goal of achieving a stable non-physical Spiritual existence.</p>
<p>Although Pagan religions are usually grouped into this category, a more careful examination would reveal that essentially all mainstream religions are Earth based religions. Mainstream religions make constant references to God and Heaven but never explain exactly what they are talking about. Their books concentrate on historical narratives concerning how people in the past lived and coped with the basic problems of human physical existence. They never give details of any level of Spiritual existence or even any specific hints about what life beyond death will be.</p>
<p>Let’s try an example. Suppose you have never seen a motor vehicle. You have heard vague stories that they exist, but that is all. Then, suddenly, you find yourself behind the wheel of a car on a high speed road like the US interstate system or the A roads in Britain. What would you guess would be your chance of survival? Try less than zero.</p>
<p>Now suppose you physically die. Suddenly, you find yourself in your Astral body. However, no one ever told you that you have an Astral body. It does not operate under the same rules as a physical body does. It is a very pliant and nimble body. It can travel in time to the past or future, access any plane and subplane in the Astral universe and research the absolute accurate and incorruptible records system known as the Akashic Records to name just a few. But, as in the previous example, you never learned how to “drive” it.</p>
<p>You would have done fine on the highway if you had gradually learned to drive a motor vehicle. You would do fine after death if you had some experience and training with your Astral body. However, no one ever taught you. What practical use is any religion that constantly rants about Heaven but offers no practical advice about your life after this life?</p>
<p>This information may have been a guarded secret in the past, but those days are gone. You can research this information to your heart’s content on the internet, locate legitimate Spiritual groups and learn from those who can leave their physical body and explore the non-physical dimensions. But, don’t expect any help from a mainstream church.</p>
<p>You might do well to recall the famous quote attributed to Jesus, <em>“The truth will set you free”</em>. Mainstream churches are large, rich institutions. They did not get that way by “setting people free”. They got that way by terrifying their followers with ridiculous horror stories of what will happen to them if they do not obey their crazy doctrines, stay with them and give them all their money.</p>
<p>Gnostic and other “non-traditional” religions may be Spiritual based as opposed to Earth based. Jesus always reminded everyone that he represented a kingdom <em>“not of this world”</em>. If we had accurate records of his true lectures we would no doubt find practical instructions and information about this “other world”. We don’t have this information because any practical Spiritual teachings he might have given were censored out to create the simplified — but Spiritually sterile — mainstream religions we have today. They are simple to comprehend and follow but will not lead you anywhere except another physical lifetime somewhere on Earth.</p>
<h4>Life Before Technology</h4>
<p>Before technology life was simple. Although existence was hard, the opportunity for Spiritual experiences was greater than today. Consider, for example, all the empty time you would have as, say, a sheep herder. Nothing to do except make sure the sheep kept moving. In this situation, there was ample opportunity for the mind to wander and perhaps contemplate and glimpse other realities.</p>
<p>Also, and perhaps most important, no electric grid existed on the planet. Electric fields appear as solid “matter” in the Astral dimension and so can affect Astral experiences — generally in a negative way. Artificially created electromagnetic waves which blanket the planet today also have subtle and generally negative effects on living creatures.</p>
<p>Pagan groups generally conduct occult rituals outdoors and away from high population areas. When buildings are used, it is desirable that they be made only of wood and assembled without any metal (nails) and, of course, have no electrical wires.</p>
<p>Both good and evil existed before technology as they always have. It was possible to use psychological propaganda to influence and control susceptible masses of people. However, the positive and negative forces were more in balance. It was not possible for a single group to successfully dominate the planet.</p>
<p>Drugs existed in the form of various plants. Adepts learned how to use them to help or harm others. People with developed psychic abilities existed as they always have and white and black occult schools existed. Legitimate Spiritual masters existed.</p>
<p>Some techniques that thrived have essentially become extinct because the population of the planet has devolved. It is next to impossible to successfully teach Tantra (sex yoga), because today’s generation is incapable of the required level of self control. Classic Tibetan yoga techniques are still taught in isolated areas, but the masters — for good reason — will no longer consider trusting outsiders.</p>
<h4>Information Control Techniques</h4>
<p>Information control is essential for protecting the integrity of a compartment. People are held as slaves by constructing an information box which holds the slaves in an information prison. As long as the “walls” of the compartment remain impenetrable, the compartment — or belief system — will be stable and no slave will escape.</p>
<p>Considerable energy is required to achieve this. Those assigned to protect the walls obviously know that the compartment is an intellectual illusion. Therefore, they must be sworn to secrecy and intimidated in such a way that they will not compromise the integrity of the compartment. It only takes one “leak” to initiate a chain of events which could collapse the compartment and so allow the slaves to escape.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the Snowden leaks. One person sharing knowledge has totally destroyed the illusion of privacy that most people had accepted as fact. It will not be possible to reconstruct this illusion. The compartment has collapsed.</p>
<p>Similar principles apply in the Spiritual spectrum. Because of the characteristics of the human bodies in use on this planet, most people do not retain any conscious memory of events before they were born. This is not universally true. Life forms on many other planets retain the memories of previous existences. Because humans generally do not have this recall, they are easily enslaved and can be conditioned to believe most anything.</p>
<p>To maintain a state of Spiritual ignorance it is important to institute methods which will prevent people from realizing that they are actually Souls experiencing a constructed illusion. People somehow reaching this state, sometimes referred to as “self realization”, will no longer respond to establishment propaganda and are generally considered a threat to the current social order.</p>
<p>The easiest and most direct method to achieve a stable slave population is simply not to talk about anything even vaguely esoteric. For example, how often have you heard the words <em>astral</em>, <em>chakra</em> or <em>aura</em> mentioned on a mainstream TV channel?</p>
<p>Most people will then likely “remain asleep” throughout their entire lifetime and will be no problem. Unfortunately, people have a natural desire — even though it may be an unconscious desire — to Spiritually evolve. It is, after all, the true purpose of human existence.</p>
<p>When someone tries to break away from the contrived illusions more direct methods are needed to return the slave to a state of ignorance. Today, various methods which cause brain damage — generally performed by psychiatrists — are used to negate any success in Spiritual evolution and return the slave to a state of vacant contentment.</p>
<h4>Diversions and Techniques Promoting Inaction</h4>
<p>The simplest and most effective diversionary technique is to promote <em>scientific atheism</em>and <em>darwinian evolutionary philosophy</em> as established fact. If you can get someone to buy into this philosophy, their fate is sealed. Even if they experience some contact with another dimension, such as an out-of-body experience, they will follow their programming, dismiss the experience as a delusion and refuse to investigate further. When they die, they will be totally lost and confused, flounder around on some lower Astral plane and eventually reincarnate just as Spiritually ignorant as before.</p>
<p>A side effect of accepting scientific atheism, which totally cripples Spiritual progress, is the acceptance of suicide as a way out of life’s problems. Suicide becomes a learned reaction. Consequently, when the Soul is sent back into another physical lifetime, it is likely to commit suicide again when faced with some unpleasant event. It never learns, and this cycle can repeat essentially indefinitely. Dealing with this is one of the most difficult problems faced by the administrators who work on the Astral planes.</p>
<p>For those who want more than scientific atheism, there is mainstream garden variety religion. Mainstream Christianity has developed a clever stonewalling technique that has worked to promote inaction for thousands of years. This technique is centered upon the argument that no one can make any progress until Jesus returns to show the way. In the meantime, people should just do nothing and wait. The effect of this is essentially the same as scientific atheism. No Spiritual progress is made.</p>
<p>Schemes designed to waste time are common. One really off the wall example is the decision in Syria to prohibit vacuum cleaners and standard flat brooms in homes. “Witch type” brooms consisting of a circular straw bundle are allowed. Surely there must be a good reason to keep these terrorist weapons out of the reach of the typical Syrian housewife. The official reason is to make basic housework as difficult and time consuming as possible so as to prevent the woman from having any free idle time which, if allowed, could lead to the emergence of “immoral thoughts”. Perfectly logical!</p>
<p>In the western world, complex bureaucracies seem to be deliberately designed to make the path to whatever you want as difficult as possible. Here the apparent motive is to prevent the acquisition of enough free time for any independent thought process. There are just not enough hours in a day to allow for any quiet contemplation of anything.</p>
<p>“Blank time” is always reported as a factor in the development of Spiritual figures. Time alone in the wilderness, time spent meditating alone in some isolated cave or at least periods of dedicated quiet time somewhere figure prominently in historical accounts of these people.</p>
<p>You may know or have heard of kids who spend all their waking hours playing interactive role model video games with other kids on the internet. They eat meals by the computer and never leave except to briefly sleep before returning to the all important game. Their entire life is spent in an imaginary reality. You may want to consider that your “real” life may not be all that different. You play a role. Your attributes are fixed by what society expects based upon that role. You can’t change, because others would notice. Your concept of the world beyond your little world is determined by what you see on TV. Daily, you receive your “fix” of carefully choreographed “programming” which appears unusually coherent because, as you may not know or fully comprehend, everything on TV is controlled by a few corporations and all of them are loyal to the official government party line. If you somehow had the opportunity to break from this structured “game” you play from day to day — say, the opportunity to visit other countries and see other cultures — you would likely realize that your existence has not been that much different from the kid addicted to a computer game. You would find that the actual “real” world had very little relationship to the world you had been conditioned to believe existed.</p>
<h4>Chemical Control Techniques</h4>
<blockquote><p><em>“With the use of chemical brain-control agents it may be possible to control the individual and the masses and to do this unobtrusively and without the active cooperation of the victims — not a question for the future — it is here”.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a quote from the book by Edgar Cayce titled <em>Edgar Cayce on Atlantis</em>. There are references to Dr. Robert Galbraith Heath, and this book bears a copyright date of 1968. The book cites an interview that Heath gave to a newspaper called <em>The Virginia Lighthouse</em> and cites the above statement made by him on November 20, 1966. Heath founded the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane University, New Orleans, in 1949 and remained its Chairman until 1980.</p>
<p>During this period, Tulane University actively participated in the CIA mind control project known as MK Ultra [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote1" name="fn1">1</a>]. Also, during this period, Tulane became an active member of the secret Institute for Defense Analyses, or IDA, a corporation whose only client is the US government. Heath reportedly performed many experiments there involving electrical stimulation of the brain via surgically implanted electrodes. This work was reportedly partially financed by the CIA and the US military. Heath is now “officially” [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote11" name="fn11">11</a>] deceased.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/skychem_dees-300x266.jpg" width="300" height="266" />You have been drugged since you were conceived — before you were even born. Your mother was drugged. Soon after birth, you were injected with mercury containing vaccines. And the systematic process of poisoning you never stopped.</p>
<p>By some estimates at least eighty percent of the food in the average supermarket is poison either because it is genetically modified or laced with pesticides and other additives. Even the air is poison now because of geoengineering chemicals sprayed into the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>It should be noted that things are different in the separate but parallel world of the elite. The Max Keiser show [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote12" name="fn12">12</a>] discussed the secret gardens in Japan. These gardens are surrounded by high walls and guarded by the military. They produce the food for the ruling elite. Every plant in the garden has its own health certificate certifying that is pure, healthy and not genetically modified. Obviously, every developed country must have a similar secret supply chain of legitimate food for its ruling class. Certainly the elite know better than anyone that the food supply for the ordinary people is poison. They’re not fools. They wouldn’t touch the stuff.</p>
<p>Vaccines used for the elite are prepared without the mercury and other toxic additives found in vaccines given to the ordinary people.</p>
<p>Various agents — mainly from plants — have always existed which could be used by those aware of them to harm others or control people by altering their state of consciousness. However, only recently has it become practical to wreck the health of essentially everyone on the planet at the same time. Genetic modification of plants and other life forms used for food has made this possible. Now, quietly, people throughout the world can be sterilized, crippled with serious health problems or even killed by altering the genetic makeup of the food supply. Ordinary people remain generally ignorant of the fact that this awesome power exists and is presently being used against them.</p>
<p>Mind control has become a science. You can’t major in it in college because this science is essentially entirely secret. The United States and other countries have spent the equivalent of billions of US dollars investigating and perfecting mind control.</p>
<p>Many secret research projects using unsuspecting or perhaps kidnapped people — some of whom were killed — have been conducted in the past and continue today. We only know about a very few of these projects such as MK Ultra, MK Naomi and Project Other. Even in these projects, specific details are sketchy. From these experiments, practical techniques for creating manchurian candidates and implanting created false personalities and identities have been developed and are in common use today within the secret communities.</p>
<p>Everyone has likely been the victim of some degree of mind control to some extent. Chemical weapons designed to mentally cripple people and render them drooling idiots are freely sold as prescription drugs in drugstores and are available to doctors to use as they please.</p>
<p>The lives of many kids are destroyed by these “drugs” because they have no ability to resist and their parents are ignorant and believe doctors can “do no harm”. Actually, today’s doctors are agents of the state. Many have top secret clearances and embrace classic Nazi philosophies such as eugenics. Their function is to watch you and make sure you “die appropriately” so as not to burden society. Anything they learn about you and anything you tell them is freely available to anyone in the intelligence community who is curious about you.</p>
<p>Only members of the super elite who are entitled to access top secret medicine will receive legitimate supportive medical care. Ordinary people will be deliberately allowed to die even though doctors with top secret clearances know of effective treatments which would cure them but which are classified and reserved for the chosen elite.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as an incurable disease any more. All the cures have been discovered. If you die, it is because you are not considered important enough to live and not because the cure does not exist.</p>
<p>Common sense should suggest to you that the lives of the elite have statistically different characteristics. For example, members of congress do not live sheltered lives. They work in close quarters and travel extensively both locally and internationally. They are always hanging out with prostitutes as well as playing with the young congressional pages.</p>
<p>Washington D.C. is reported to have more brothels than fast food joints. Strangely, however, these people do not get sick. Have you ever heard that congress had to shut down because everyone was coming down with some infection. It happens in other close populations, so what would make them exempt?</p>
<h4>Understanding Astral Damage</h4>
<p>Living things have an Astral component. For example, when you cut a leaf and then see the complete leaf on a Kirlian photo you are viewing the Astral component which was unaffected by cutting the physical component because it does not exist in the physical dimension.</p>
<p>Over one hundred years ago, practical techniques for viewing the human Aura were developed by Walter J. Kilner [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote4" name="fn4">4</a>]. The original technique used dicyanin dye and a later technique used special glasses. You can’t find either one today. In his research, Kilner was able to demonstrate that defects in the human Aura appeared before some corresponding disease manifested in the physical body.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was able to detect and prevent an adverse physical condition <em>before</em> it ever physically materialized. So, you ask, why don’t we have this marvelous medical technique available today? Well, we do. It is in use in top secret medicine. However, only the approved elite now have access to it. The information has been removed from public knowledge and classified.</p>
<p>In conventional allopathic medicine, which is based upon scientific atheism and sold to the general public, there is officially no such thing as an Astral body. Conventional medicine denies the existence of anything beyond the physical dimension. Since the Astral body officially does not exist, it is not recognized as a crime to deliberately harm it.</p>
<p>Damage to the Astral body can be compared to damage to the physical body. If you punch holes in the physical body by cutting it, shooting bullets at it or whatever, blood runs out and germs get in. If you cause enough damage, the body dies. Astral bodies do not die, but can suffer critical energy losses. Similar to physical bodies, punching holes in the Astral body allows essential energy to escape and harmful energies to enter.</p>
<p>There are many events which can harm your Astral body. It is in your interest to understand these events because your Astral body will be your primary body when your physical body dies. If it has been damaged, you will be at a severe disadvantage. The chosen elite have perfect Auras because they can use the Aura balancing machines available to them at any top secret medicine provider. However, you cannot.</p>
<p>Also, the ruling elite seem to take some delight in causing harm to the “ordinary” people. Consequently, many drugs, food additives, GMO foods and industrial chemicals found in the environment cause Astral damage. Chemicals recognized as poisons and banned in other countries can be freely added to foods given to ordinary people in the US.</p>
<p>Obviously, there must exist a secret supply chain of safe food and water which is available to the chosen since they know of the contamination and certainly would not want to harm themselves or their friends.</p>
<p>There are ways to closely duplicate the secret techniques available only to the elite. If you can see auras or can find a reputable psychic who can, you can approximate the techniques developed by Kilner and available to everyone over a hundred years ago. Although the secret aura balancing machines are more accurate, a competent psychic healer can do the same thing. Actually, since psychics have always existed, similar techniques have been available throughout the ages to those who were aware.</p>
<h4>Fluoride</h4>
<p>The concept of adding fluoride to drinking water for the purpose of mind control is said to have originated in the 1930′s as a result of collaboration between German and Russian scientists [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote2" name="fn2">2</a>]. Sodium fluoride was originally used and was found to cause a “mild lobotomy” in people who consumed small quantities. The effects were considered to be non reversible after one year of continuous use of the tainted water. Hitler added sodium fluoride to the water in his concentration camps to make the prisoners docile and cooperative as they waited for death.</p>
<p>Sodium fluoride (NaF) is used today in personal products like toothpaste. To poison the water supply of an entire country with sodium fluoride would be expensive. However, it just so happens that there is a waste product created during the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers, Fluorosilicic acid (H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>), which is classified as hazardous waste and would be expensive to dispose of under EPA guidelines.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/flor_dees-300x256.jpg" width="300" height="256" />There is lots of this stuff available. This is the poison added to the public water supply in the US and some other countries. It is actually economical for industry because they don’t have to pay for hazardous waste disposal. They just pump it into the public water supply.</p>
<p>In the human body, fluoride has an affinity for the pineal gland in the brain. The pineal gland is associated with the “third eye”. Everyone has this third eye, but few are aware of it or know how to activate and use it.</p>
<p>Although the pineal gland is part of the physical body, the associated third eye is part of the Astral body and so is invisible in the physical dimension. The third eye allows you to see and communicate with the non-physical dimensions while fully awake and functioning in the physical dimension. So, you could see and carry on a conversation with someone in the physical dimension while invisibly also viewing and communicating with some entity on another plane of existence.</p>
<p>The standard Christian bible refers to the third eye with the phrase, <em>“If thy eye be single thy whole body will be filled with light”</em>. However, only students of mysticism would recognize the true meaning of this quote.</p>
<p>Obviously, having this ability would be a threat to the security of any totalitarian society. Poisoning with fluoride destroys this ability and so solves that problem. Literature is available if you wish more detailed information. Simply search using the phrase “fluoride third eye”.</p>
<p>On the chance that fluoride in the water is not sufficient to destroy any psychic abilities you may have, there are more aggressive ways to get fluoride into your brain. Here are some structural models of popular psychiatric drugs:</p>
<div align="center">
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Fluphenazine.jpg" width="200" height="108" /><br />

<em>Trifluoperazine</em></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that the element Fluorine (symbolized by its standard chemical symbol “F”) figures prominently in all these compounds.</p>
<p>These drugs are used to cause “chemical lobotomy”. By blocking communication channels with the higher levels of the human brain, they effectively convert the victim into a lower form of animal. Lower animals do not have the frontal lobes possessed by humans. That is what makes humans special. Disabling the frontal lobes effectively transforms a natural human being into, basically, a docile and obedient house pet which can be trained like a dog.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Fluorine also figures prominently in Sarin nerve gas.</p>
<div align="center">

<h4>They All Drink From the Same Trough</h4>
<p>If you casually look out upon the institutions of the world, it may appear to you that they are independent, discrete entities. However, they are not. They are all components of a collective which has successfully hidden its existence and true nature from the general population for generations.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the media in the US. Although it may appear to you that there are thousands of independent sources reporting “news”, 90% of all media is controlled by six corporations. They are General Electric, News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time-Warner and CBS.</p>
<p>In the US, people believe they are protected from tyranny by the concept of “separation of powers” — that the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government are staffed by independent thinkers who “check and balance” each other. This is also a deception.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/horns_dees-300x266.jpg" width="300" height="266" />Once a year, at the end of July, there is a secret gathering on private property in the redwood forest of California called the Bohemian Grove. Although this annual meeting has been going on for over one hundred years, it is only during the last several years that outsiders have begun to learn of its existence. The only reason they have is because of the internet and independent journalism. Leaders from the mainstream media are all members of this secret club and so never even report its existence.</p>
<p>Who else goes to this annual secret “party”? Well, for want of a better name, we will call them the “Trusted Satanists”. They are the leaders of all the major corporations, banks and representatives from all the major branches of the US government as well as foreign governments.</p>
<p>Although these men outwardly support the concept of capitalism for the masses, this elite group, among themselves, are perhaps best described as “rich socialists”. Only men are allowed. For recreation, a stable of prostitutes — both male and female — are kept nearby off-site. The male prostitutes could theoretically enter the Grove.</p>
<p>The “party” begins with a Satanic ritual called “Cremation of Care” (i.e., “we don’t care”) which features the burning of a coffin at the base of a huge statue of an owl. Walter Cronkite reportedly was the official announcer at the grove until his death.</p>
<p>A secretly filmed video of this event is available on YouTube. It is supposed to be a “simulated” child sacrifice. However, since the CIA, FBI and NSA attend the ritual, who is going to complain on the chance it is a real sacrifice of a human child? After all, they are all trusted Satanists.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rep_flag.png" width="100" />Most attendees from the United States are members of the Republican party. This is completely predictable in view of the fact that the US Republican party flaunts its affiliation with the “dark side” by prominently using the inverted star symbol on its official logo.</p>
<p>During the two week period, corporate leaders, the “independent” government regulators who supposedly keep corporations honest, the leaders from the executive, legislative and judicial branches of US government who are supposed to be “checking and balancing” each other, as well as the media moguls who we “trust” to report the truth, are all running around naked in the woods — pissing on the trees, playing with each other, and the male prostitutes as well as the off-site female prostitutes, and “having discussions”.</p>
<p>Well, what are they “having discussions” about? They are discussing what they plan to do with “their world”. The Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic bomb was reportedly planned at one of these discussions years ago. What about you? What about your future? What about any expectation of happiness you may have? Well, you see, you “don’t need to know”. Remember, <em>“If you are not one of us, you are nothing”</em>.</p>
<h4>Blueprints For the New World</h4>
<p><strong><em>Overview</em></strong></p>
<p>If this link [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote7" name="fn7">7</a>] is still active, it would be in your interest to read through it. This document is a transcript of a speech given by one of the insiders in the year 1969. He boldly states,<em>“Everything is in place and no one can stop us now”</em>.</p>
<p>The article details how people (“people” means the slave class who are “nothing”; recall: <em>“If you are not one of us, you are nothing”</em>) will just have to get used to changes such needing permission to have children, accepting mandated euthanasia as the law and total surveillance. Essentially all goals are now achieved, although some still remain guarded secrets.</p>
<p>The 1960′s was the period when physical death was eliminated. Of course, this “privilege” is only available to the select Satanic oligarchs. Effective cures for all diseases were also developed. The speaker [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote7" name="fn7">7</a>] states that the cures are on file in the Rockefeller Institute. Of course, most are classified and only available to the chosen elite.</p>
<p><strong><em>Infrastructure</em></strong></p>
<p>The PBS documentary, <em>Top Secret America</em> [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote8" name="fn8">8</a>], presents a good overview of the secret world of the elite. You may think no one is paying attention to the infrastructure in America because streets are in disrepair and bridges are falling down. However, you would be wrong. A tremendous amount of money is being spent on infrastructure in America — for the chosen elite. You will never see it and you will have no need for the decaying bridges and streets because you won’t be around to use them. You, as well as 90+ percent of the current population, will be killed in the “Great Culling”.</p>
<p>The new infrastructure is quite elaborate as the documentary explains. It consists of thousands of buildings which have a few stories visible above ground but which then extend for 90+ stories underground. All amenities are available within these secret structures which are basically self-sufficient.</p>
<p>It is important for the buildings to reach deep underground so that the lower levels can connect to the secret underground transport network. This network is global and provides safe high speed transport for the elite. Whenever the network crosses a tectonic plate, massive amounts of silicone are used to allow the transport tunnel to flex as needed. The network has access points in all countries. However, these points remain secret in countries which have yet to be subdued and co-opted into the new world order.</p>
<p><strong><em>NWO Enabling Documents</em></strong></p>
<p>The treaty known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership appears to be the formal enabling document for the new world. The actual document is secret and only high level corporate executives and politicians are allowed to see it.</p>
<p>Even after the treaty goes into force, its contents will remain secret. Because, in the United States, treaties must be openly debated in congress, the treaty is being called an “agreement” to circumvent the law and keep its contents secret. However, some details have become known.</p>
<p>Although the planet is officially divided into “sovereign” countries, it is overlaid with a network of transnational corporations. This network basically forms a parallel government which encircles the globe. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is designed to cause any country which signs on to surrender its national sovereignty to a secret committee composed of corporate executives. This committee can then alter the constitution and laws of any country which has accepted the treaty as suits their whim. There will be no appeal against this.</p>
<p>Under the treaty, there will be only one purpose to human life. That purpose will be to maximize the profits of the cabal of transnational corporations which will now be essentially a single global corporation in absolute control of the world. This effectively institutionalizes the new world order.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? Well, to begin with, there can be no retirement. Paying for retirement would negatively impact corporate profits. So, if you can’t work, you will be killed. Taking care of sick people would also drain corporate profits. It would be more profitable just to kill the sick and replace them with young, healthy slaves. Disabilities — forget it — disabled kids will never make it out of the womb alive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reeducation</em></strong></p>
<p>To come into compliance with the philosophy of the new world, people will need to be reeducated. Military instruction documents [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote6" name="fn6">6</a>] are already teaching that the Founding Fathers of the United States were extremists and anyone who thinks like them would not be suited for today’s military.</p>
<p>Well, what did these radical extremists think?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, these principles are not compatible with the new world. The idea of a “Creator” conflicts with the official doctrine of Evolution. We can’t have that. People must accept that they and the universe they live in is simply an “accident”.</p>
<p>People are already realizing that Liberty and Happiness are gone. They know now that they live under constant surveillance and their lives get worse year after year. How about the right to Life? Can’t have that. People need to be reeducated to believe that it is their “duty to die” when they are no longer useful to the state (which is now the global corporation).</p>
<p>Of course, the global elite will live physically forever but ordinary people will not know this.</p>
<p>If a world where people are conditioned to want to die and do not want kids but just sleep around for fun sounds vaguely familiar to you, you might recall that this is the future society described in Huxley’s classic novel, <em>Brave New World</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Population Modification</em></strong></p>
<p>Please refer to [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote9" name="fn9">9</a>] as a reference source. Today’s “great thinkers” seem to be coming into agreement that most people are unnecessary and need to be exterminated for the convenience of the elite. Bill Gates, who has now been accepted into the super exclusive Bilderberg group, has reportedly taken the task of exterminating the third world population by giving them “free” vaccinations which will render them sterile.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/hungryman_dees-300x247.jpg" width="300" height="247" />Lots of groups are working on secret sterilization methods. European tests of Monsanto’s GM soybeans on hamsters showed the animals became sterile by the third generation [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote12" name="fn12">12</a>]. A new gene known as <em>Epicyte</em> [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote9" name="fn9">9</a>] is planned to be added to GM corn which will cause immediate sterilization.</p>
<p>Additionally, people are being “eased into” accepting the concept of “after birth abortion”. Intellectuals are trying to get people to accept the argument that living human children under three or perhaps even five years old are really “not people but advanced feotuses”. Since abortion is already legal, a simple change in the definition of “feotus” would allow young kids to be killed at will for any reason.</p>
<p>Another “new thought” gradually being programmed into the young is the pleasure of the “childless lifestyle”. This propaganda seeks to convince people that having kids is too much trouble and they will be happier if they just get sterilized and then run around having lots of sex purely for fun.</p>
<p>These “evolutionary” population control techniques are already in effect. However, the elite likely are not willing to wait several generations to get rid of those they do not need. This brings us to the more direct method commonly called “The Great Culling” which will allow the elite to kill off most of the world’s population quickly.</p>
<p>The most likely method will be the release of new designer viruses for which no one will have any natural immunity. Of course, the elite will all get the classified antidote. Preparations for the disposal of the bodies is already complete and stockpiles of plastic coffins — each designed to hold three bodies and manufactured under government contract by Halliburton — have been photographed and documented. Everything is now in place awaiting the “go” command.</p>
<p><strong><em>Designer Children</em></strong></p>
<p>Some types of designer children have already been approved for “production”. Britain has approved three parent babies [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote10" name="fn10">10</a>] and China has proposed a process to artificially fertilize most of a woman’s eggs and then examine them to determine which is likely to produce a child with the highest IQ. This will be the only selected egg because Chinese women are only allowed to have one child and must then be sterilized.</p>
<p>In the new world where the only purpose of people will be to do slave labor to serve the elite corporate masters, the concept of allowing the existence of children conceived naturally clearly cannot be allowed. There would be an unexceptable chance for some kind of error that could result, for example, in the creation of a being capable of independent thought who might challenge the establishment.</p>
<h4>A man’s true worth is measured by the amount of other people’s happiness that he can possess and destroy</h4>
<p>This is a quote from the docudrama <em>The American Ruling Class</em> [<a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/war-god/#footnote5" name="fn5">5</a>]. It is worthy of discussion because it is so prophetic.</p>
<p>The Satanic oligarchs who run this world basically exist and thrive on the misery of others. It is not enough just to use and abuse you — they want to consume your Soul. Your misery and suffering is, essentially, their “food”. It is the source of their energy.</p>
<p>Ordinary innocent Souls are sustained by the life energy which flows from the Creator. However, since the oligarchs hate God, this energy flow is not available to them. So, they essentially survive by consuming the life energy of the innocent Souls they have captured and enslaved.</p>
<p>Ordinary people do not naturally choose to spend their lives in a state of constant war. They have to be somehow coerced into this behavior. Otherwise, they would likely seek a quiet, peaceful life. The atrocities the US and other warmonger nations force their citizens to commit are so contrary to basic human nature that the US loses more soldiers to suicide than it does to the enemy. The once innocent soldiers find that they simply cannot continue to live with what they have become and the memories of the horrors they have caused to others. The Satanic rulers who create wars, of course, have no problem with this.</p>
<p>Promotions within the inner circles of power are based upon how much evil one has done. The more harm you cause to others the greater your respect. You may have noticed that the stock market, which is a measure of the success of the elite, shows gains during periods when the average person is suffering and losses during periods when, somehow, life for the ordinary person seems to improve. The stock market set a new all time high, for example, during the Vietnam War when innocent young kids were being drafted and slaughtered in Vietnam while peaceful protesters at Penn State were executed by government forces for daring to dissent.</p>
<h4>Why You Should Care</h4>
<p>On the low Astral planes you will find people — Souls — who are totally lost and confused and seem to move in slow motion. They do not realize they have died. These “people” are not there because they tore up the Bible or burned the Koran or some other offensive act. They are there simply because it is the best they can do. They are using all of the Spiritual energy they have just to maintain this miserable existence. Whatever activities they engaged in while alive had no Spiritual merit and had no effect on developing or increasing their Spiritual energy level. Since the opportunity to do this ended when they died, they will remain strung out in this condition until they reincarnate again at which point they will have another chance to choose activities which enhance Spiritual energies.</p>
<p>You should care because the things you do and the things you fail to do during your brief life here will affect your existence for millions of years in the future.</p>
<p>The other dimensions operate under exact scientific rules just like this dimension. However, the rules are not the same. Because alternate sources of information are available today — mainly because of the internet — it is in your interest to at least investigate the available literature on Spirituality, energy raising techniques and various first-hand reports from people who have successfully visited the neighboring dimensions.</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/cabalchess3.jpg" />The infamous Trilateral Commission still exists. Many people think the TC, created in 1973 by David Rockefeller, is a relic of an older time. Think again.</p>
<p>Patrick Wood, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H4GPJO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000H4GPJO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwnomorefake-20" target="_blank"><em>Trilaterals Over Washington</em></a>, points out there are only 87 members of the Trilateral Commission who live in America. Obama appointed <em>eleven</em>of them to posts in his administration.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the original stated goal of the TC was to create “a new international economic order.” Knowing that you have to break eggs to make an omelette, consider how the following TC members, in key Obama posts, can help engender further national chaos; erase our sovereign national borders; and install binding international agreements that will envelop our economy and money in a deeper global collective: a new world order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tim Geithner</strong>, Treasury Secretary;</li>
<li><strong>James Jones</strong>, National Security Advisor;</li>
<li><strong>Paul Volker</strong>, Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee;</li>
<li><strong>Dennis Blair</strong>, Director of National Intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Trilateralists.</p>
<p>In the run-up to his inauguration after the 2008 presidential election, Obama was tutored by the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, <strong>Zbigniew Brzezinski</strong>.</p>
<p>In Europe, the financially embattled nations of Greece and Italy brought in <strong>Lucas Papademos</strong> and <strong>Mario Monti</strong> as prime ministers. Both men are Trilateral members, and Monti is the former European chairman of the Trilateral Commission.</p>
<p>In the US, since 1973, author Wood counts eight out of 10 US Trade Representative appointments, and six out of eight World Bank presidencies, as American Trilateral members.</p>
<p>Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote, four years before birthing the TC with his godfather, <strong>David Rockefeller</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“[The] nation state as a fundamental unit of man’s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force. International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Several other noteworthy Trilateral members: <strong>George HW Bush</strong>, <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>, <strong>Dick Cheney</strong>, <strong>Al Gore</strong>. The first three men helped sink the US further into debt by fomenting wars abroad; and Gore’s cap and trade blueprint would destroy industrial economies, while vastly increasing the numbers of people in Third World countries who have no access to modern sources of energy.</p>
<p>Does all this offer a clue as to why the US economy has failed to recover from the Wall Street debacle of 2008, why the federal bailout was a handout to super-rich criminals, and why Obama took actions which prevented a recovery?</p>
<p>A closer look at Tim Geithner’s circle of economic advisers reveals the chilling Trilateral effect: Paul Volker; <strong>Alan Greenspan</strong>; <strong>E. Gerald Corrigan</strong> (director, Goldman Sachs); and <strong>Peter G Peterson</strong> (former CEO, Lehman Brothers, former chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations). These men are all Trilateral members.</p>
<p>How many foxes in the hen house do we need, before we realize their Trilateral agenda is controlling the direction of our economy?</p>
<p>The TC has no interest in building up the American economy. They want to torpedo it, as part of the end-game of creating a new international currency, ushering in a de facto Globalist management system for the whole planet.</p>
<p>Any doubt on the question of TC goals is answered by David Rockefeller himself, the founder of the TC, in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812969731/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812969731&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwnomorefake-20" target="_blank"><em>Memoirs</em></a> (2003):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Even in what many people mistakenly think of as the TC’s heyday, the 1970s, there were few who realized its overarching power.</p>
<p>Here is a close-up snap shot of a remarkable moment from out of the past. It’s a through-the-looking-glass secret—in the form of a conversation between a reporter, Jeremiah Novak, and two Trilateral Commission members, <strong>Karl Kaiser</strong> and <strong>Richard Cooper</strong>. The interview took place in 1978. It concerned the issue of who exactly, during President Carter’s administration, was formulating US economic and political policy.</p>
<p>The careless and off-hand attitude of Trilateralists Kaiser and Cooper is astonishing. It’s as if they’re saying, “What we’re revealing is already out in the open, it’s too late to do anything about it, why are you so worked up, we’ve already won…”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>NOVAK (the reporter):</em> Is it true that a private [Trilateral committee] led by Henry Owen of the US and made up of [Trilateral] representatives of the US, UK, West Germany, Japan, France and the EEC is coordinating the economic and political policies of the Trilateral countries [which would include the US]?</p>
<p><em>COOPER:</em> Yes, they have met three times.</p>
<p><em>NOVAK:</em> Yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should remain informal because to formalize ‘this function might well prove offensive to some of the Trilateral and other countries which do not take part.’ Who are you afraid of?</p>
<p><em>KAISER:</em> Many countries in Europe would resent the dominant role that West Germany plays at these [Trilateral] meetings.</p>
<p><em>COOPER:</em> Many people still live in a world of separate nations, and they would resent such coordination [of policy].</p>
<p><em>NOVAK:</em> But this [Trilateral] committee is essential to your whole policy. How can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular support [for its decisions on how Trilateral member nations will conduct their economic and political policies]?</p>
<p><em>COOPER:</em> Well, I guess it’s the press’ job to publicize it.</p>
<p><em>NOVAK:</em> Yes, but why doesn’t President Carter come out with it and tell the American people that [US] economic and political power is being coordinated by a [Trilateral] committee made up of Henry Owen and six others?After all, if [US] policy is being made on a multinational level, the people should know.</p>
<p><em>COOPER:</em> President Carter and Secretary of State Vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches.</p>
<p><em>KAISER:</em> It just hasn’t become an issue.</p>
<p>Source: <em>Trilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World Management</em>, ed. by Holly Sklar, 1980. South End Press, Boston. Pages 192-3.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, although Kaiser and Cooper claimed everything being manipulated by the Trilateral Commission committee was already out in the open, it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Their interview slipped under the mainstream media radar, which is to say, it was ignored and buried. It didn’t become a scandal on the level of, say, Watergate, although its essence was far larger than Watergate.</p>
<p>US economic and political policy run by a committee of the Trilateral Commission—the Commission had been been created in 1973 as an “informal discussion group” by David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who would become Jimmy Carter’s National Security Advisor.</p>
<p>When Carter won the presidential election, his aide, Hamilton Jordan, said that if after the inauguration, <strong>Cy Vance</strong> and Brzezinski came on board as secretary of state and national security adviser, “We’ve lost. And I’ll quit.” Lost — because both men were powerful members of the Trilateral Commission and their appointment to key positions would signal a surrender of White House control to the Commission.</p>
<p>Vance and Brzezinski <em>were</em> appointed secretary of state and national security adviser, as Jordan feared. But he didn’t quit. He became Carter’s chief of staff.</p>
<p>Now consider the vast propaganda efforts of the past 40 years, on so many levels, to install the idea that all nations and peoples of the world are a single Collective.</p>
<p>From a very high level of political and economic power, this propaganda op has had the objective of grooming the population for a planet that is one coagulated mass, run and managed by one force. A central engine of that force is the Trilateral Commission.</p>

			<p><strong>These Dates Forever Changed America For The Worse&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/flagusupsidedown3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/flagusupsidedown2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Well, Obamacare is now in effect. The decision by Congress to pass Obamacare into law back in 2010 ranks among the most draconian, most egregious, most horrific actions ever taken by the central government in Washington, D.C. This bill rocks the principles of liberty and constitutional government to the core. It changes fundamental foundations; it repudiates historic values. The same flag may fly on our flagpoles, the same monuments may grace our landscape, and the same National Anthem may be sung during our public ceremonies, but it is not the same America. For all intents and purposes, our nation now more resembles the socialist countries of the old communist East Bloc than it does the constitutional republic of the old land of the free.</p>
<p>I was honored to have been invited to be the keynote speaker at the annual meeting of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons recently in Denver. It was a very large gathering of physicians from all over the country. And I can tell you that the doctors I spoke with are all very, very concerned about the future of healthcare in the United States. Take a peek at the condition of healthcare in socialist countries throughout the world or take a peek at the condition of healthcare in our VA clinics and hospitals, and you will get a little feel for what healthcare is going to quickly look like in America.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2010, Congress passed, and on March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the dreaded national health care bill into law, and as such, these dates join a list of dates that have contributed to the destruction of a free America. Of course, there are several such dates, but, in my opinion, the following are the most draconian.</p>
<p><strong>April 9, 1865</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when General Robert E. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to U.S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. Regardless of where one comes down on the subject of the War Between the States, one fact is undeniable: Abraham Lincoln seriously dismantled the Jeffersonian model of federalism in America. Ever since, virtually every battle that free men have fought for the principles of limited government, State sovereignty, personal liberty, etc., has stemmed directly from Lincoln’s usurpation of power, which resulted in the subjugation and forced union of what used to be “Free and Independent States” (the Declaration of Independence). In fact, the philosophical battles being waged today regarding the current health care debacle (and every other encroachment upon liberty and State autonomy by the central government) have their roots in Lincoln’s autocracy.</p>
<p><strong>July 9, 1868</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment was ratified. This amendment codified into law what Lincoln had forced at bayonet point. Until then, people were only deemed citizens of their respective states. The Constitution nowhere referred to people as “US citizens.” It only recognized “the Citizens of each State.” Notice also that citizenship was only recognized among the “several States,” not among people living in non-State territories. Until the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, people were “Citizens of each State.” (Article. IV. Section. 2. Paragraph. 1.) The 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment created a whole new class of persons: “citizens of the United States.” This false notion of “one nation” overturned the Jeffersonian principle that our nation was a confederated republic, a voluntary union of states.</p>
<p><strong>February 3, 1913</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when the 16<sup>th</sup> Amendment was ratified, and the direct income tax and IRS were instituted. This was a flagrant repudiation of freedom principles. What began as a temporary measure to support the War of Northern Aggression became a permanent income revenue stream for an unconstitutional&#8211;and ever-growing&#8211;central government.</p>
<p><strong>April 8, 1913</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when the 17<sup>th</sup> Amendment was ratified. This amendment overturned the power of the State legislatures to elect their own senators and replaced it with a direct, popular vote. This was another serious blow against State sovereignty. The framers of the Constitution desired that the influence and power in Washington, D.C., be kept as close to the people and states as possible. For example, the number of representatives in the House of Representatives was to be decided by a limited number of voters. In the original Constitution, the ratio of “people of the several States” deciding their House member could not exceed “one for every thirty thousand.” (Article. I. Section. 2. Paragraph. 3.) And when it came to the US Senate, the framers also recognized the authority of each State legislature to select its own senators, thereby keeping power and influence from aggregating in Washington, D.C. The 17<sup>th</sup> Amendment seriously damaged the influence and power of the states by forcing them to elect their US senators by popular vote. The bigger the State, the less influence the State legislature has in determining its US senator. Senators who answered to State legislators, each answering to a limited number of voters, were much more accountable to the “citizens of the several States” than those who were elected by a large number (many times numbering into the millions) of people. For all intents and purposes (at least in the larger states), US Senators are more like “mini-Presidents” than representatives of sovereign states.</p>
<p><strong>December 23, 1913</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when the Federal Reserve Act was passed. This Act placed oversight of America’s financial matters into the hands of a cabal of private international bankers, who have completely destroyed the constitutional principles of sound money and (for the most part) free enterprise. No longer would the marketplace (private consumption, thrift, growth, etc.) be the determinant of the US economy (which is what freedom is all about), but now a private, unaccountable international banking cartel would have total power and authority to micromanage (for their own private, parochial purposes) America’s financial sector. Virtually every recession, depression, and downturn (including the one we are now experiencing) has been the direct result of the Fed’s manipulation of the market. 1913 was not a good year for the United States.</p>
<p><strong>June 26, 1945</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when the United Nations Charter was signed and America joined the push for global government. Ever since, US forces have spilled untold amounts of blood and sacrificed thousands of lives promoting the UN’s agenda. Since the end of World War II, in virtually every war in which US military forces have been engaged, it has been at the behest of the UN. And it is also no accident that America has not fought a constitutionally declared war since we entered the UN&#8211;and neither have we won one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is America’s involvement in the United Nations that has spearheaded this devilish push for a New World Order that George H. W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, Walter Cronkite, et al., have talked so much about. The United Nations is an evil institution that has completely co-opted our US State Department and much of our Defense Department. It is an anti-American institution that works aggressively and constantly against the interests and principles of the United States. But it is an institution that is ensconced in the American political infrastructure. Like a cancer, the UN eats away at our liberties and values, and both major political parties in Washington, D.C., are culpable in allowing it to exert so much influence over our country.</p>
<p><strong>June 25, 1962, and June 17, 1963</strong></p>
<p>These are the dates when the US Supreme Court removed prayer (’62) and Bible reading (’63) from public schools. At this point, these two Supreme Court decisions were the most serious affront to the First Amendment in US history. Think of it: from before a union of states was established in 1787, children had been free to pray and read the Scriptures in school. We’re talking about a period of more than 300 years! Of course, the various State legislatures&#8211;and myriad city and county governmental meetings&#8211;still open their sessions in prayer, as do the US House and Senate, and even the US Supreme Court. But this same liberty is denied the children of America. There is no question that America has not recovered from these two horrific Supreme Court decisions. In effect, the federal government has expelled God not only from our public schools, but also from our public life. And America has not been the same since.</p>
<p><strong>October 22, 1968</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968. Before this Act, the 2<sup>nd</sup>Amendment was alive and well in the United States. The Gun Control Act of 1968 turned a right into a privilege and forever forced the American people to bow at the altar of government when seeking to arm themselves. Interestingly enough, this Gun Control Act mirrored Nazi Germany’s Gun Control Act of 1938. In fact, the Gun Control Act of 1968 is almost a verbatim copy of Hitler’s Gun Control Act of 1938.</p>
<p>Our Founding Fathers could never have imagined that the American people would ever allow their right to keep and bear arms be infringed. In fact, it was the attempted confiscation of the firearms stored at Concord, Massachusetts, that triggered the War of Independence in 1775. That the people of Massachusetts would be denied their right to keep and bear arms, as they are today, could not have been foreseen&#8211;and would never have been tolerated&#8211;by America’s founders.</p>
<p>The hundreds and hundreds of draconian gun control laws that have been inflicted upon the American people have all come about as a result of the Gun Control Act of 1968.</p>
<p><strong>January 22, 1973</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when the US Supreme Court issued the Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions, which, in effect, legalized abortion-on-demand. These two decisions expunged the Jeffersonian principle that all men are endowed by their Creator with the unalienable right to life (Declaration). Since then, more than 50 million unborn babies have been legally murdered in their mothers’ wombs. Abortion is, without a doubt, America’s national holocaust. It has opened the door to a host of Big Government programs and policies that have resulted in the wanton destruction of human life both in the United States and overseas. It has created an entire industry whose express purpose for existing is the destruction of human life. It has desensitized the conscience and soul of America. Furthermore, it has forced men of decency and good will to finance&#8211;with their tax dollars&#8211;the unconscionable act of killing unborn children.</p>
<p>And once again, another Jeffersonian principle was eviscerated. He said, “To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.” The Roe and Doe decisions violate this principle in the most egregious manner possible.</p>
<p><strong>October 26, 2001</strong></p>
<p>This is the date when President George W. Bush signed the USA Patriot Act, and the federal government’s war against individual liberty began in earnest. Most of the unconstitutional eavesdropping, snooping, wiretapping, phone call intercepting, email reading, prying, financial records tracking, travel watching, ad infinitum, ad nauseam, by federal police agencies began with the implementation of the Patriot Act. The Department of Homeland Security and the “war on terrorism,” which have resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people worldwide, and the usurpation of federal power at home, have all come about as an outgrowth of the Patriot Act. The Patriot Act has forever shifted the focus of American law and jurisprudence against constitutional government and individual liberty, toward a police-state mentality.</p>
<p><strong>October 17, 2006, and October 9, 2009</strong></p>
<p>These are the dates when President G.W. Bush signed and President Barack Obama re-signed the Military Commissions Act. This Act is the outgrowth of the Patriot Act and has, in effect, terminated the fundamental protections of individual liberty, which are found in the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. For all intents and purposes, the Patriot Act and Military Commissions Act (along with the NDAA) eviscerated the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Amendments, and do serious injury to several others. The Military Commissions Act also expunges the constitutional right of Habeas Corpus.</p>
<p><strong>March 21 and 23, 2010</strong></p>
<p>These are the dates when Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” the so-called “health care reform” bill that we spoke about at the beginning of this column. While Social Security and various Welfare programs have toyed with socialism in the United States, this bill is the largest and most expansive endorsement of socialism in American history. This bill socializes some 18% of the US economy by socializing the health care industry in America. The fallout and ramifications of this bill are going to be horrific.</p>
<p>When future historians review the demise of our once-great republic, they will observe that the above dates were the dates that destroyed America. The American people have been far too tolerant for far too long.</p>

</div>
<p>All Americans share the shame of the charade that pretends to be the Federal Government. The governance class operates in a manner that thinks the voice of the people is irrelevant. The current shutdown of public services is a selected con game run by &#8220;<em>Federalies</em>&#8221; thugs. This latest extortion racket intends to break the spirit of reform and sensible opposition. The crony capitalist takeover of the health care system only benefits the corporatists. The insurance companies stand to reap tribute from the masses, while the special interest friends of the Obama syndicate get exemptions. Make no mistake, the den of thieves that defend Obamacare, as the &#8220;law of the land&#8221; is a herd of habitual liars.</p>
<p>The Democrats prove their symbol, the ass, is more stubborn than usual. The Senate refusal to conference with the House and observe the constitutional duties of Congress means that Senator Harry Reid and his cohorts own this shutdown. Barack Hussein Obama is busy campaigning and lecturing the recalcitrant Republican House members for not capitulating to his dictates. The hordes of zombie groups that luv Barry Soetoro still have not figured out that the promised free health care has a zinger of a cost.</p>
<p>The Republicans Senators, who just sit on their hands as Dingy Harry trashes and lies from the well of the chamber floor, refuses to react to Reid’s <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/4/reid-apologizes-nasty-tone-senate-floor/">mea culpa</a>, &#8220;saying he and his colleagues have simply gotten too personal and nasty in their floor debates.&#8221; The long silence of most GOP RINO’s is taken as implied consent, has the beleaguered public frustrated and confused.</p>
<p>What is at stake is the total enslavement of the populace. This confrontation is not over Obamacare alone. No, it has more to do with the very nature of the representative government. Democratic principles are not synonymous with mob rule. However, when the entrenched Senators in safe districts refuse to pass a budget and demand that continued resolutions must keep funding unnecessary programs, you get an imperial government.</p>
<p>Speaker <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/general/sotu-fact-senate-democrats-haven-t-passed-budget-nearly-four-years-president-s-late-again">John A. Boehner</a> makes a sensible argument.</p>
<p>FACT: Senate Democrats haven’t passed a budget in nearly four years. The president’s is late again (for the fourth time). Neither have a plan to replace the Obama sequester.</p>
<blockquote><p>The last time Senate Democrats passed a budget was April 29, 2009 – <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/general/179-round-trips-moon-7-other-things-you-could-do-time-senate-democrats-last-passed-budget/?ref=home">nearly four years ago</a>. One Democratic leader called budgeting &#8220;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/20/news/la-pn-harry-reid-budget-20110520">foolish</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/general/paychecks-line-senate-dems-suddenly-open-budget">now that their paychecks are on the line</a> under the GOP-led No Budget, No Pay Act are Senate Democrats talking about passing a budget. The &#8220;no budget, no pay&#8221; effort is supported by <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/general/harper-survey-72-back-house-gop-nobudgetnopay">72 percent of the American people</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.speaker.gov/general/no-budgets-no-jobs-council-meetings-what-would-you-say-you-do-here">Ordinary people … meet their deadlines</a>,&#8221; said President Obama. But his budget is late for the fourth time. <a href="http://budget.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=276880">That&#8217;s the most of any president</a>. Ever. [<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/speakerboehner/8468201132/in/photostream">SEE INFOGRAPHIC</a>]</p>
<p>When the president finally submitted a budget last year, <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/general/white-house-touts-budget-got-zero-votes-excuse-more-delays">it received zero votes</a> in the House and Democrat-controlled Senate. Zero.</p>
<p>House Republicans have routinely sought to address major challenges: the House passed budgets in <a href="http://budget.house.gov/fy2012budget/">2011</a> and <a href="http://budget.house.gov/fy2013prosperity/">2012</a> that protect and strengthen our entitlement programs for future generations; first voted to replace the president&#8217;s sequester in <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll247.xml">May 2012</a> and to address the rest of the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; in <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll545.xml">August 2012</a>; and more.</p>

When will the Senate pass a budget?</p>
</div>
<p>Folks, you are on the verge of a national crisis not seen since the Presidency of Abraham Lincoln. Over one hundred and fifty years ago, the tyrant of union supremacy caused the destruction of the constitutional republic. Today, you have a globalist cabal in change of an empire at war with its citizens. The shutdown, seen as an opportunity to marginalize the last vestige of patriotic opposition, is a tactic of coercive compliance.</p>
<p>The presstitute media, owned and edited by statist enablers and apologists spins a fantasy viewpoint of responsible government. The reality is that deficit spending is so systemic that the added cost of Obamacare is ignored from the debate for a revamping of the health care establishment.</p>
<p>An administration, so fond of claiming to be the champion of equality, is eager to pervert the ill-conceived and destructive <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/where-can-i-read-the-affordable-care-act/">Affordable Care Act</a> by executive orders. Only a demented utopia is still willing to contend that the public will experience improved health care at an affordable price.</p>
<p>Put aside the civic funding component in all the passed House resolutions, the true cost of this shutdown centers upon the violation of the social compact bargain with the people. A true populist advocacy is realistic of the dangers and risks from power politics. However, such a representative and self-governing moral alternative requires a serious dialogue on the limits of fiat governance. It is especially, imperative to recognize when despotism becomes the normal method of any governing body.</p>
<p>When Tea Party activists are called domestic terrorists, the discussion transforms into pure demagogic intimidation. The police state thrives on the capitulation of scared citizens. The Disunited States of Amerika, once known as the home of the brave, now trembles in fear. Government clones are equivalent to the blue belly troops that pillaged the sovereign southern states in their quest to impose their version and vision of an authoritarian central government.</p>
<p>WE CAN STOP OBAMACARE!!!</p>
<p>Now you may dismiss such a minor endeavor, as a small effort to change the world, but the rhetorical question is what are you doing today to confront an evil system that no longer represents the ordinary hard working family, attempting to live their lives with dignity and responsibility?</p>
<p>Inaction guarantees that well funded public mercenaries push through their plans for subjugation without any resistance. At bear minimum, engage and build relationships with like-minded activists willing to push back. Joining the <a href="https://www.teapartycommunity.com/">Tea Party Community</a> is a start. Communicate and keep informed. Sign-up for the <a href="http://eepurl.com/ESQ5L">BATR RealPolitik Newsletter</a> and work your own mailing lists as a regular activity.The government has encircled your neighborhood with a siege of starvation, both economically and spiritually. The establishment has raped your offspring with a financial burden and tax penalties that steal their future.</p>
<p>Hate the NeoCons in the Republican Party, BATR certainly does; but crawl out of your easy chair and demonstrate your support for any political figure or organization that is lobbying or pressuring the Obama administration to recognize the tremendous opposition coming from grassroots America.</p>
<p>Network across the web, but even more significant is to organize your own neighborhoods. &#8220;All politics is local&#8221; is not just a throw away term. It is where the rubber meets the road of your daily life. Add to your area and regional agenda, the need to confront federal agencies, whenever the destructive statists seek to enforce their punitive regulations.</p>
<p>This federal shutdown might be the last warning that the Chicago Saul Alinsky strategies carried out by criminal operatives in the Obama presidency are the enemy. They are annihilating radicals and extremists, dedicated to the total destruction of the country.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://thehill.com/video/in-the-news/326605-boehner-rallies-his-troops-at-closed-door-conference">Boehner</a> says: &#8216;This isn&#8217;t some damn game&#8217;, the public need to act upon the warning, and participate immediately is imperative.What will the nation look like if the political career class purges out of office all opposition to the collectivist society? The answer should be frightening to any person grounded in the history and traditions of this nation.</p>
<p>The POTUS is waging war on ordinary citizens. Recent presidents have been following the same script, just from different chapters. Looking for allies within the federal bureaucracy is difficult, when their latest paid vacation is just another reward for implicating the draconian policies of the Obama junto.</p>
<p>All those &#8220;<em>Federalies</em>&#8221; who walk over protestors and trash civil liberties are rapists. They betray and violate their oath of office, as protected outlaws for the system.</p>
<p>When the federal government shreds fundamental legal protections and perverts the law to impose government by executive orders, a federal government shutdown is not out of place. However, the Obama crew is determined on making this disruption as painful and ugly as possible. Such leadership as this deserves a toast in Hades.</p>
<p>The American public deserves better, but the commander of theft is hell bent on letting Senator Reid do much of the dirty work. The fearless Lou Dobbs report, <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/2720227910001/democrats-harsh-words-over-the-government-shutdown/?playlist_id=164630">Democrats’ harsh words over the government shutdown</a>, says it all. My fellow citizens the evil anarchists are not the constitutional defenders within the Tea Party, the real nihilists and legislative arsonists are the arrogant sycophant Democrats on their Jihad campaign against Middle America.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/SOFAgeneric3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/SOFAgeneric2.jpg" align="left" /></a>JoAnne Denison has made a very big mistake, it appears. Denison, who has been a licensed attorney in the State of Illinois for twenty seven years, has been writing about corruption in the courts.</p>
<p>That appears to be a career-killing No- No.</p>
<p>Denison first became concerned as to the hanky panky going on in State Probate courts via her involvement in the adult guardianship of Mary G. Sykes. Sykes was put under an adult guardianship, without apparent legal jurisdiction by the Cook County Court. Neither Mary Sykes nor her adult daughter, Gloria, were served with notice of the proceedings. The court- appointed guardians have subsequently isolated the elderly woman from family and friends for roughly four years.</p>
<p>This is sadly not unusual in guardianship/conservatorship cases. When a concerned family member or friend attempts to intervene in what is often abuse of the “protected person” by the court- appointed guardian, the protesting party often gets treated most severely by the court. Restraining orders are passed out in these cases like salt water taffy, and more often than not there is a lack of due process involved in the restraining order hearings.</p>
<p>Meaning, in lay terms, that the restrained person does not get a hearing. </p>
<p>There also appears to be questionable financial actions taken by the guardians, Adam Stern and Cynthia Farenga, in the Mary Sykes matter. Over a million dollars in gold coins have been unaccounted for by the guardians. Once again, this is&#8211; unfortunately&#8211; business as usual in probate court. While one of the primary functions of a guardian is to conserve the estate, many guardians tend to look at OPM&#8211;”Other People&#8217;s Money” as a free pass to whoopee it up on someone else&#8217;s dime. Guardians “forget” to do inventories, “lose” valuable artwork and antiques and in some cases “misplace” entire bank accounts.</p>
<p>Denison, however, found all this abuse and embezzlement to be&#8230;..inappropriate. She began a blog, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmarygsykes.com&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNHN7jFxDYrOyWsA51qXxIJUL9f7wg">marygsykes.com</a>, which has featured articles by attorneys, award-winning journalists and bloggers as well as her own commentary on what is happening on a widespread basis in probate courts across the country. She has faithfully posted the legal documents relevant to the Sykes case.</p>
<p>And for this public service, Denison may lose her license to practice law.</p>
<p>Going into the complaint, which was filed by Jerome Larkin of the Illinois Attorney Registration &#038; Disciplinary Commission (IARDC), one finds that Denison is being tried for exercising her right to informed free speech. Larkin cites a number of quotes from Denison on her blog as evidence of the following:</p>
<p>a) Making a statement which a lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge&#8230;..</p>
<p>b) conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation&#8230;.</p>
<p>c) conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice&#8230;</p>
<p>d) presenting, participating in presenting, or threatening to present criminal charges to obtain an advantage in a civil matter&#8230;.</p>
<p>e) conduct which tends to defeat the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute.</p>
<p>I happen to think that Mr. Larkin over extended himself when he constructed this list. I have personally been reading the marygsykes blog for some time and am unaware of JoAnne Denison making any false statements. I am aware, however, that her criticisms of the malfunction of justice in these proceedings could well be considered in the category of someone declaring that the Emperor is not wearing any clothes&#8230;.</p>
<p>In other words, JoAnne Denison speaks politically inconvenient truths.</p>
<p>The complaint details some of the posts by Ms. Denison concerning the failures of the court to honor Mary Sykes&#8217; constitutional rights as well as concerns about the dispensation of her funds. Here are a couple of the posts which Larkin found objectionable:</p>
<p><strong>A July 28,2012 blog entry entitled &#8220;My fax to Diane Saltoun, Executive Director<br />
at the Illinois Atty General,&#8221; stating:<br />
While the above case has a long, long history, much of which is<br />
documented on a blog to be found at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marygsykes.com&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNECKUOVA9Egto2lDsZ9aFoKHcwoPw">www.marygsykes.com</a>. the<br />
reality of the situation is that this probate proceeding boils down to<br />
garden variety theft, embezzlement, malpractice and mal feasance by<br />
attorneys and the court. ..<br />
Please look at the attached and all the information I will fax you<br />
shortly. This is a case that could be bigger than Greylord-what is<br />
being done to deprive grandma and grandpa of their civil rights and<br />
how the Probate court (routinely) operates.”</strong></p>
<p>Yep, them is fighting words, you can bet your booty on that. The fact that Ms. Denison&#8217;s post references concerns that have been brought to the attention of the court—a million missing dollars in gold coins, for starters&#8211;must have gotten Mr. Larkin all worked up. Because look at what else he has found objectionable in Ms. Denison&#8217;s blog:</p>
<p><strong>An April 19,2012 blog entry entitled &#8220;Ken Ditkowsky&#8217;s answer to the complaint<br />
filed against him by the ARDC via Cynthia Farenga,&#8221; wherein Respondent suggests<br />
that the GALs and the Guardian ad Litem stole Mary Sykes&#8217; money by stating:<br />
Kend (sic) Ditkowsky and I have been caught up in all of this because<br />
we have been working tirelessly on this blog and to inform others of<br />
this situation&#8211;and those attorneys who will churn fees at hundreds of<br />
dollars per hour-want us silenced. They apparently have a lot of clout<br />
in Probate and even with the ARDC &#8230;<br />
</strong><br />
Jumping Jehosophat!! You mean an attorney can now be cited for misconduct for reporting that a guardian and attorneys have committed embezzlement and are exercising what is commonly called &#8220;undue influence&#8221;? Isn&#8217;t that what courts and the media are supposed to do? Provide a forum (a public one, to remind the reading audience) wherein acts of criminal misconduct and corruption can be ferreted out?</p>
<p>Or was Larkin&#8217;s real concern that Denison discussed the clout that miscreant attorneys have with both the Court and his employer, the IARDC? Was Denison hitting too close to home for his comfort?</p>
<p>Attorney Ken Ditkowsky has also been subject to IARDC proceedings for his involvement in the Sykes case. Ditkowsky, who has been sending out emails to Attorney General Eric Holder and others, requesting an honest and complete investigation of the Sykes case, has been recommended for four years suspension from the practice of law. Ken Ditkowsky has been licensed to practice law since the early 1960&#8242;s.</p>
<p>The IARDC complaint against Ditkowsky references the attorney&#8217;s efforts to investigate the Sykes matter and also his efforts to represent Mary Sykes, as requested by Mary (the court had previously declined to appoint her counsel). In addition, the complaint also references statements Ditkowsky has made relating to the integrity and qualification of judicial officers.</p>
<p>Since the IARDC has recommended his suspension, Ditkowsky has continued to contact federal officials with his concerns about  the Sykes case. If anything, he has become louder and more insistent concerning the deprivation of rights inflicted upon Mary Sykes and others.</p>
<p>Ditkowsky is now referring to these cases as “elder cleansing,” a clear reference to what happened in another genocide, the first launched under Hitler, which cleansed Germany of hundreds of thousands of elderly and disabled ethnic Germans. Ditkowsky has also coined the phrase “ethics cleansing,” to refer to the removal from the Bar register attorneys who object to the abuses being administered via probate guardianships.</p>
<p>A letter from Guardian ad Litem Cynthia Farenga to the IARDC has since surfaced. In the letter, dated November 20, 2011, Farenga asks the IARDC for an investigation of Ditkowsky and Denison due to a blog post which appeared on Probate Sharks in 2011. In the blog post, Ditkowsky and Denison call for a State and Federal investigation of the Sykes case.</p>
<p>The Farenga letter confirms the very perception, memorialized on her blog, for which Denison is now under disciplinary proceedings. The fact that Farenga and others in the probate cabal do have torque with the ARDC should exonerate Denison from prosecution for saying so. But it has not.</p>
<p>It is of interest that the judge in the Sykes case, Judge Jane Louise Stuart, has deep financial ties to President Obama. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcitizenwells.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F04%2F21%2Fobama-mansion-rezko-william-miceli-probate-judge-jane-l-stuart-harvey-wineberg-kenneth-j-conner-fired%2F&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNGUOukef4ymtcB8ItUGxgk0dGqSTg">http://citizenwells.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/obama-mansion-rezko-william-miceli-probate-judge-jane-l-stuart-harvey-wineberg-kenneth-j-conner-fired/</a></p>
<p>Given that Ditkowsky has repeatedly emailed officers in the Obama administration concerning this case, one must ask if favors were requested by Stuart, who appears to own Obama&#8217;s mansion.</p>
<p>The website for the State of Illinois states that:</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.state.il.us%2Faging%2F2rules%2Frules-main.htm&#038;sa=D&#038;sntz=1&#038;usg=AFQjCNHzV1wt_CURY9xCLMy4JnjBPAmnhw">Elder Abuse and Neglect Act</a> provides that people – who in good faith report suspected abuse or cooperate with an investigation – are immune from criminal or civil liability or professional disciplinary action. It further provides that the identity of the reporter shall not be disclosed except with the written permission of the reporter or by order of a court.</p>
<p>This should exonerate both Denison and Ditkowsky from disciplinary action for the reasons stated by the IARDC. Possibly the law does not apply when the judge is a financial supporter of President Obama.</p>
<p>In any event, the word is getting out: Ethical lawyering has gone the way of the Stegosaurus.</p>
<p>And the First Amendment? It doesn&#8217;t specify who has free speech and who does not. One more Constitutional protection is being thrown under the bus.</p>
<p>James Grogan, Deputy Director for the IARDC, declined to comment on whether the Elder Abuse and Neglect Act offered protection for Denison and Ditkowsky, stating he cannot comment on pending cases. When asked if, given the fact that the judge in question appears to own President Obama&#8217;s home, there might have been some federal directives issued in these two cases, Grogan also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Other lawyers who have been under the gun due to their attempted defense of conservatees include Grant Goodman, AZ; Margie Mikels, California; Jim Reiss, California.</p>

</div>
<p>You know, in spite of the visit from <i>The Bone Lady</i> when I was just three years old, and all the grim foreshadowing that she downloaded to me via direct intuition, I always held out hope that humanity could or would somehow turn things around on this planet, and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<p>As long as there is breath there is always hope, that was my thinking for a long time, but I am no longer so sanguine.</p>
<p>As one of my friends recently remarked to me, there is, indeed, real evil abroad in this world. I don’t know how else to explain the wickedness of what is happening at Fukushima, in Japan, where the situation with the exploded and/or melted down nuclear reactors just goes from frightfully dire to unimaginably worse.</p>
<p>I frequently check the developments there at <a href="http://www.enenews.com/" target="_blank"><em>www.enenews.com</em></a> and the latest news is very disturbing. I said from the outset, in the spring of 2011, that Tokyo would be evacuated. I still believe that to be inevitable. It is possible that much of Japan will be evacuated to elsewhere. The apocalyptic dimensions of the crisis are being covered up by TEPCO, the Japanese government, General Electric, and the USSA government. The reality is that there was at least one, and maybe more, really dirty nuclear blasts there in March of 2011, that wrecked the reactors and created a radioactive hell that no one knows how to remedy or bring under control. At the least we are probably looking at the failure and collapse of Japanese society with likely evacuation of tens of millions of people or more, and the fairly rapid death of vast portions of the Pacific Ocean, as deadly radioactive waste water continues to flow into the sea by the hundreds of tons, every day.</p>
<p>And when the cooling pool at reactor four collapses, the many tons of highly radioactive, spent, fuel rods that it contains will overheat and burn and or catastrophically fission, i.e., cause a runaway, nuclear reaction, or, in lay man’s terms, there will be another atomic explosion, along with a mushroom cloud, and tons of highly poisonous nuclear isotopes will be spread aloft into the atmosphere and/or will drain or be blown into the sea, to poison the Pacific Ocean even further.</p>
<p>This is worse than bad news. This is planetary chaos news. This is civilization ending news. This is species extinction level news, as in extinction of the human species on this planet. If you do not think so, all I can say is: wait. It won’t be long. Probably not ten years, not five, maybe even by Christmas this year, and you will begin to see what i mean, if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>And even if the cooling pool at reactor four doesn’t fail or collapse of its own accord in the near future, though that is very highly probable, TEPCO’s plan to manually remove the many tons of bent, mangled, fused, welded together, very highly radioactive fuel rods that remain in the pool, beginning in November of this year, is so fraught with peril that it is likely to spectacularly fail, with unimaginably negative consequences. Any slight mistake, miscue or dropped fuel rod could result in a fission criticality, a runaway nuclear chain reaction, to wit, an atomic explosion that will shower the northern hemisphere and the Pacific Basin with a fatal radioactive sleet that will persist for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>As I said, the situation is somewhere far south of dire, with a headlong, hellward trajectory.</p>
<h4>The Nuclear Chain Reaction</h4>
<p>Because what is inevitable, the longer the situation at Fukushima festers, is that the whole site will have to be abandoned. Due to the high radiation levels, no one will be able to work there without dying. So the workers will pull back, and the cooling pools and storage pools that contain thousands of tons of extremely radioactive, spent fuel rods will fail or collapse and there will be more explosions and radioactive fires. As the radioactively contaminated NO GO ZONE expands, as the population flees, the day will come when nuclear reactors at other, nearby power generating plants will also fail, melt down and/or explode, because the nuclear engineers and maintenance workers no longer come to work and operate them — BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD.</p>
<p>And then there will be three or four more, and the radioactive No Go Zone will expand, widen, grow. And other nuclear power plants will then fail, melt down and/or explode, because their operators are also DEAD, and so do not come to work, do not maintain them.</p>
<p>There are over 50 nuclear power reactors in Japan, and they all have their spent fuel rod cooling pools. It doesn’t matter if the reactors themselves are shut down, because there are thousands and thousands of tons of highly radioactive, spent, nuclear fuel rods stored in the cooling pools all over Japan. So, given time, the crisis will continue to fester and worsen, and then it will begin to cascade, like a row of toppling dominoes, only it will be a series of failing nuclear power reactors, one after the other, heralding the end of the nuclear age, and quite possible the end of humanity.</p>
<p>It’s just that serious.</p>
<p>All of that will send a killing wave of radioactivity across the Pacific to North America. So what happens when the population on the west coast of the USSA flees in panic from the approaching killer wave of radioactivity? Well, there will be no one left to operate the nuclear power reactors in California, for example. or at Palo Verde, the massive nuclear power plant just to the west of Phoenix. So when those nuclear reactors and their spent fuel cooling pools fail, melt down, and/or blow up, the civilization-ending, planet-killing, Fukushima Syndrome will come home to America with a wicked vengeance.</p>
<p>All courtesy of General Electric. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant">General Electric designed five out of the six reactors at Fukushima and built three of them</a>, so what we see here is genocidal, planet-killing failure of American (alleged) “high technology” on a spectacular scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Bring_Good_Things_to_Life">General Electric — busy exterminating a planet near you of its resident, biological life forms.</a></p>
<p>At the end of the day, all the differential calculus, the nuclear physics, the nuclear chemistry, the nuclear engineering, the corporate profits, the Madison Avenue advertising slogans, the multinational wheeling and dealing, all has conspired to assassinate the planet on which we, and they, all live. Make no mistake, the planet is now dying. The global poisoning process is so very far advanced that it probably cannot be stopped. Certainly, there is not now any serious, international effort to do so, not anything remotely commensurate with the level of danger that we are facing.</p>
<p>No doubt we are dealing with profound iniquity, a betrayal so complete of all that is human that no words exist to describe its foul dimension. The ones who have done this thing walk among us, though for how long? – understanding that they, too, will certainly drop dead along with countless millions of others, as a direct result of their abjectly arrogant ignorance.</p>
<h4>Arrogant Ignorance</h4>
<p>All of their super-computers, the advanced mathematics, their (so-called) “hi-tech” industrial base, all of their billions of dollars of (so-called) “high finance” — and they kill the planet? And themselves and their posterity in the process? That’s the best they can do? They get a PhD in nuclear chemistry and use their (so-called) “knowledge” and (so-called) technical “expertise” to kill the planet? <b>The planet that they also live on?<i></i></b></p>
<p>Geniuses. All of them.</p>
<h4>Central Banking Middle East Madness</h4>
<p>Then there is the very real prospect of a shooting, nuclear war, beginning in the Middle East. The USSA has a powerful fleet in the region. So do the Russians, as a counterpoint. Sadly for all humanity, the Washington, DC — City of London — Lower Manhattan — Tel Aviv — NATO cabal seems hell bent on war, and so we are on the slippery slope to war. Unfortunately, this psychopathic cabal is very heavily nuclear armed.</p>
<p>I saw all of this coming from waaaaaaay back, from way back in my infancy, since the age of three years, when <i>The Bone Lady</i> visited me and clued me in to realities that I still don’t want to think about, given their ghastly, hideous savagery. But I’ll tell you what, it’s enough to give a man insomnia, it’s enough to drive him out onto the nuclear missile silos, again and again, in a personal effort to inject a note of sanity and warning into a positively insane political and military climate, in an attempt to wake up anyone who may be susceptible to awakening.</p>
<p>ANYONE.</p>
<p>My latest sally was 15 April 2010 in North Dakota, USA. I went over the security fence onto the H-8 Minuteman III nuclear missile silo in the Minot Air Force Base nuclear missile field, near Parshall, North Dakota, at the intersection of 33rd Street and 76th Avenue. I conducted a nonviolent, peace demonstration on the silo and was arrested by the USSA military and imprisoned for 100 days, almost all of the time served in the Heart of America Correctional and Treatment Center in Rugby, North Dakota.</p>
<p><a href="http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html">My Minot Manifesto explains my motivations, reasons and spiritual and political philosophy.</a> It is one of the most important documents I have written in my entire life.</p>
<p><a href="http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/serious-message-from-heart-of-america.html">A Serious Message From The Heart of America was my personal statement that I mailed to the news media from jail in Rugby, North Dakota, on 14 July 2010,</a> prior to being criminally tried and convicted in USSA federal court in Minot, North Dakota.</p>
<p>I explain the symbolism in my dress and accoutrements in the photo below, in the text of my lengthy <a href="http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html">Minot Manifesto</a>. It’s thirteen pages, but worth the time and effort to read. It is a major life statement on my part, that reflects literal decades of deep thought, a very large quantum of concentrated life energy and hours, weeks, months and years of preparation, a statement that distills an important fraction of my life essence into human language. I invite you to partake of my gift by taking the time to read and reflect on what I have written, and then to take meaningful, principled, creative, nonviolent action yourself.</p>
<p>I don’t quite know what more to say, what more to do. In fact, were I to do more than I already have, and I have been out on the nuclear missile silos three times (and been jailed for my trouble all three times, in Arkansas, Missouri and North Dakota), I would run the very real risk of infringing on <b>your</b> right and <b>your</b> very real, personal <b>RESPONSIBILITY</b> to also courageously act. So what are you waiting for? Why are you here on this planet, at this time, reading this blog post, and articles like it?</p>
<p>Because make no mistake about it, the time to act, if you are going to act, is here. The time has arrived. The planet is on the brink. We face the very real prospect of a shooting nuclear war. Additionally, the Fukushima crisis, and the threat from nuclear power plants in general, ALL OF THEM, could not be more serious.</p>
<p>In recent days, I find myself musing about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gb0mxcpPOU">the closing scene from “Dr. Stramgelove,” with the haunting song by Vera Lynn, “We’ll Meet Again, Don’t Know Where, Don’t Know When,” that was such a huge hit in World War II,</a> for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And it fills me with such melancholy and sorrow. Because if it starts, this ugly thing called nuclear war, and we are headed that way, can all unravel very rapidly. The machines will take over, and automated, pre-programmed orders of battle will be carried out, without human control, as machines battle machines with nuclear fire. Waves of missiles will come in, again and again, to batter the underground bases. I have read the declassified documents. Warhead after warhead will come in at 10 minute intervals. You cannot imagine the depths of the hell that is already programmed and waiting to be unleashed.</p>
<p>Back in the 1960s, the USSA military was counting on 140 million casualties in the mainland USSA alone. I know this because I have read the documents. I have done the research. The USSA population is much larger now, and much more urban, so the casualty rate would be even higher. Maybe 200 million? 250 million casualties in the USSA alone?</p>
<p>Do you think you will just watch that on CNN?</p>
<h4>Refuge in the Southern Hemisphere</h4>
<p>If you have read my previous writings you will know that I have said that <b>IF</b> humanity has a future, it is likely to be in the southern hemisphere, if only because the lion’s share of the nuclear weapons and nuclear power reactors are in the northern hemisphere. As the nuclear power plants fail, melt down, and/or explode most of them will be in the northern hemisphere. This is not an intellectual exercise — already we have had catastrophic failure of nuclear power plants at Chernobyl, Ukraine and Fukushima, Japan. They are just the first. There will be more.</p>
<p>Likewise, any shooting nuclear war is logically likely to be concentrated in the northern hemisphere, since all of the known, nuclear armed, military powers are in the northern hemisphere</p>
<p>But even then, there are enormous problems in the southern hemisphere. The vegetation in the Amazon region of South America produces something like 20 to 30% of the oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere. As the Amazon dies, and it is being destroyed right now, so too, is the Earth’s breathable oxygen supply being destroyed. I don’t know about you, but I breathe oxygen all day and all night, every day and every night of my life.</p>
<p>So even if we resolve the nuclear issue, and there is ZERO progress on that front right now, only to lose the Amazon, we all will still die, because none of us can survive with 20 to 30% less oxygen. Just cannot.</p>
<p>Right now, we, humanity, every last one of us, are in a life and death struggle for the life of our species, and the life of our planet.</p>
<p>If we win, we live. If we lose, we die. ALL OF US.</p>
<p>End of the story. End of our species’ genetic line. For ever and ever.</p>
<p>Done. Finished.</p>
<p>So maybe moving to Bolivia or Uruguay or Namibia or Madagascar or New Zealand will buy you a little time, a year or ten. However, if we fail to rein in and ABOLISH nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, if we fail to reforest the Earth and cleanse it of radioactive contamination, then we are through. It’s the end for us.</p>
<p>This is our group decision. Right now we are on a self-destructive path to global extinction.</p>
<h4>So Here Is My View</h4>
<p>If you will act decisively, now is the time. Pick your issue and your spot and act creatively, courageously and nonviolently.</p>
<p>It’s your world and your life. Act like they both count for something.</p>
<p>And here’s the other thing. If you cannot, or will not act, then how about supporting those of us who have acted, and who continue to act?</p>
<p>In my case, I have paid a very heavy price, in earnings forever foregone, by putting my life on the line, repeatedly, for you, whom I do not even know. But because you are my human kin, I went out on the missile silos, again and again, and I went to jail. I lost more than a year and a half of productive labor. I lost, as well, the opportunity to have a whole wide range of well paying jobs, due to my arrest and prison record, even though I have multiple advanced university degrees, up to the doctorate level.</p>
<p>Subsequent to my arrival in South America, I immersed myself in Amazonian shamanic culture, the better to understand the Amazonian region, the jungle itself, and the shamanic human ecology of the region that interfaces with the hyper-conscious plants in the jungle, only to be very gravely assaulted by one of the said Amazonian shamans and hospitalized for more than four months with massive trauma to both my body and emotions. I am now pursing a criminal case against the shaman and that also costs heavily, several thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees, at the very time when so much of my time and energy is taken up with therapy and the sheer physical effort of getting around with impaired mobility. Nine months after the assault I still have physical nerve trauma in my lower extremities, a good deal of numbness and what is called drop foot. I walk with crutches. My electro-therapy also costs. At the moment I cannot go to electro-therapy, although I badly need it, because I only have $35 to my name.</p>
<p>I have run completely through my meager life savings and there is no more.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have this week begun the formal petition process to the government of Ecuador to request political asylum. My years-long record of anti-nuclear activism and repeated jailing by the USSA government is one factor in my decision, coupled with other factors such as recent revelations of universal NSA surveillance and espionage, the secret arrest and indefinite military detention provisions of the NDAA of 2012 and 2013, the recently revealed, previously secret 2011 FBI documents that blatantly discuss plans to murder Occupy Movement activists by sniper fire, including in San Antonio, Texas, where I lived and worked as a window washer from 2000 to 2009, and all of this in the context of an all encompassing pattern of unbridled lawlessness and pervasive lying with regard to EVERYTHING by the American government. All of this and more, has brought home to me the seriousness of this moment that we are living now.</p>
<p>I have the obligation to safeguard my own liberty and safety. It is clear to me that politically I am freer and safer in Ecuador than in the USSA. The American government has taken a hard, dictatorial turn towards neo-fascism. That is the plain truth. The harsh, repressive treatment of Edward Snowden and Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning makes that clear enough. We are in altogether different territory now. And so I have petitioned for political refuge in Ecuador.</p>
<p>This also entails paying an attorney, to assist me in my interactions with the administrative, legal and political system in Ecuador. It is my life on the line and I am proceeding very carefully, every step of the way.</p>
<p>But it is also your life on the line, in that my anti-nuclear activism, my immersion in the Amazonian culture, and my pursuit of political refuge in Ecuador all have profound implications far beyond just me. What happens to me also has broad implications for you. The consequences of nuclear war are too horrific to contemplate, and if it is to be avoided, it is because of actions such as mine. Similarly, we simply cannot afford to lose the Amazon, and yet we are losing it right now. If we are to save it, a big part of that will be due to the personal efforts of those who come to the region and get personally involved in the nitty-gritty, even life-threatening struggle for the soul of the Amazon, because more than anything, we are involved in a pitched battle for the very spirit and soul of the Amazon and of the rest of this planet.</p>
<p>Similarly, if I, with my history of activism, book writing, researching, blogging, public speaking, interviews, and repeated nonviolent civil disobedience and consequent jail record, cannot obtain political refuge abroad, then what hope do you have? You’re boxed in, that’s what. You’re in a cage with no exit.</p>

<h4>Come Ye That Love The Lord</h4>
<p>I am a native Virginian, and have lived, worked, traveled, studied and gone to jail all over the American South, from the Virginias and Maryland, all the way across to South Texas, and numerous points in between. A very large block of my life has been spent down South. Although I am not now a church attending man, I have in the past been in all kinds of Christian churches, both Black and White, in big cities and small country towns.</p>
<p>Some of the most memorable sermons I have ever heard have been by Black pastors in rural areas of the deep South. One of the things I like about the traditional Black style of hymn singing down South is the way that the head deacon or pastor will frequently line out a hymn, especially the first line or two of a verse, and then the other deacons or members of the choir will join in, accompanied by riffs on the organ, if there is an organist, and there are some really gifted organists playing in southern Black churches.</p>
<p>I well remember a sermon that I once chanced to hear, decades ago, by a Black lay preacher, one sultry, Sunday night, in a tiny little town way down South, about as far south as you can go, and still be in the South and not somewhere else. The ceiling fans lazily stirred the muggy summer air, as the moths flitted vainly around the naked incandescent light bulbs hanging from the ceiling overhead. The windows were flung wide open and the pale light from the sanctuary washed feebly out through the rusted screens and flooded onto the close cropped lawn that surrounded the church. It was one of the most extraordinary public speaking performances I ever witnessed. The preacher used as his text Ezekiel 37, the theme being dry bones and systematically connecting them one to the other, the purpose being to reassemble and restore “them dry bones” to life. As he spoke, I saw that he fell into a trance, that he entered another state of consciousness, that he was self-hypnotized and that the sermon itself had a sort of existence independent of him, that the message took on a life of its own and was using his mind, his mouth, his body, to project itself into the ears, hearts and minds of the sparse assemblage present that evening. As he finished, he collapsed exhausted backwards into his armchair and lined out the first words of the hymn that he wanted the choir to sing. I don’t anymore remember exactly what song he called for, but it could well have been this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxHmgHYG50o"><em>Come Ye That Love The Lord</em></a></p>
<p>If there is to truly be a new world order, as distinct from the obscene power that currently holds sway on this planet today, then we will need to see a completely new order of human being on this world, a species of human being motivated by love for the Creator and by devotion to inward and outward service to the sacred life impulse. We don’t see that now, and the human species may go extinct on this planet for its want.</p>
<p>I do believe in God and have been profoundly privileged to see some of His servants face to face. I find their company congenial.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Come, ye that love the Lord,<br />
And let your joys be known;<br />
Join in a song with sweet accord,<br />
And thus surround the throne.</i></p>
<p>Let those refuse to sing<br />
That never knew our God,<br />
But children of the heavenly King<br />
May speak their joys abroad.</p>
<p>The God of heaven is ours,<br />
Our Father and our love ;<br />
His care shall guard life’s fleeting hours,<br />
Then waft our souls above.</p>
<p>There shall we see his face,<br />
And never, never sin;<br />
There, from the rivers of his grace,<br />
Drink endless pleasures in.</p>
<p>Yes, and before we rise<br />
To that immortal state.<br />
The thoughts of such amazing bliss<br />
Should constant joys create.</p>
<p>Children of grace have found<br />
Glory begun below:<br />
Celestial fruits on earthly ground,<br />
From faith and hope may grow.</p>
<p>The hill of Sion yields<br />
A thousand sacred sweets,<br />
Before we reach the heavenly fields,<br />
Or walk the golden streets.</p>
<p><i>Then let our songs abound,<br />
And ev’ry tear be dry;<br />
We’re trav’lling through Immanuel’s ground,<br />
To fairer worlds on high.</i></p>
<p>(John Wesley, ca. 1703- 1791)</p></blockquote>

<p>With a failed Presidency, Barak Obama is on the verge of becoming a perpetual buffoon in a skit on Saturday Night Live. Even with such public distain, the destructive policies of the rogue government merrily continue. The bipartisan cabal class of careerists operates as if they are permanently immune from public outrage. Up to now, they are correct. The Tea Party was hijacked and went dormant, the bulk of the anti-war opposition is AWOL and the government trolls within the occupied movement are now interning at Goldman Sacks. As for the throngs of Obama cult worshipers, who continue to place their faith in state decency and righteousness, are still on a pilgrimage to cash their loyalty checks. Yet, something has changed, but is it too late?</p>
<p>The staff at PJ Media, who bills themselves as &#8220;Voices from a free America&#8221;, compiled <a href="http://pjmedia.com/zombie/2012/11/02/why-was-there-no-october-surprise/">The Complete List of Barack Obama’s Scandals, Misdeeds, Crimes and Blunders</a>. Whether you agree or object to their selection, it is very difficult to defend such a record. Oh, maybe for the likes of Obama groupie turned CNN crossfire media whore, <a href="http://crossfire.blogs.cnn.com/stephanie-cutter/">Stephanie Cutter</a>, it is just another day at the office. Just <em>what-you-goanna-do</em>; when your hero breaks the law and betrays the trust of the country?</p>
<p>For the true believer fold who remains correct to the doctrine, just deny and lie. The international humiliation that Obama self-inflicted upon himself over his retreat from a Rambo inspired Syria mission is a tipping point for the fools who once saw the man of mystery as a savior. As it turns out, he has more in common with Austin Powers than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/06/business/col-aaron-bank-101-dies-was-father-of-special-forces.html">Col. Aaron Bank</a>.Consistently Pat Buchanan provides the operative insight, as reported in <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/pat-buchanan-putins-op-ed-outstanding-looks-like-a-statesman/">Mediaite.com</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fox News analyst Pat Buchanan spoke to Off the Record host Greta van Susteren Wednesday night and praised Vladimir Putin’s op-ed in the New York Times as outstanding, pointing out that it was the Russian president, and not President Barack Obama, who was best speaking to American opinion on Syria.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read it twice,&#8221; Buchanan said, &#8220;and, candidly, it was an outstanding piece. Vladimir Putin made a better case against U.S. strikes in Syria than the President of the United States did last night…He is reaching out to the anti-war community in the United States, the anti-interventionist community on Syria, which, as we know, recently, is probably around 60, 70, 80% of the American people. And he’s doing it in an op-ed, and I think it’s very effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, in the last week, Vladimir Putin has looked like a statesman,&#8221; Buchanan said, contrasting Putin’s acumen with the &#8220;petty&#8221; behavior of Obama &#8220;stiffing&#8221; him at the G20.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Inescapably, the military-industrial-security-spy complex just continues to prepare for the next opportunity to expand their asinine interventionist involvement. The proponents of the Zionist &#8220;Greater Israel&#8221; security project view the Middle East conflict, as the ultimate excuse to perfect and execute the domestic police state back in the homeland. In this case, the fatherland is the Disunited States that is rapidly resembling and adopting the Israeli model of oppression.</p>
<p>Barack Hussein Obama is a creation of elitist invention. His usefulness has reached an end for his masters. There is no doubt that the tremendous acceleration in the systematic dismantling of the remains of a constitutional republic, going on for the last quarter century, made great strides under Obama. However, the time has come for a real slowdown in the transition to the empire gulag if he remains as the spokesman in chief.</p>
<p><img alt="sad-obama-face.jpeg" src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/sad-obama-face.jpeg.w300h102.jpg" width="300" align="Left" /></p>
<p>The reason is clear Obama has lost his effectiveness. Sure, he can make a chump out of Secretary of State John Kerry, but that is a natural reflex out of the windsurfer. The more important development is that he is losing the obedience within the military that usually blindly follow orders. Here is the real hope. A movement within the ranks of the junior officer corps to break with career advancement and stand up to the Generals is necessary. Refusing to deploy for another NWO expedition is the key for the implosion of the evil empire.</p>
<p>The GOP chicken hawks who demand that Syria must be neutralized are pathetic cowards. The entire NeoCon agenda is built upon a false and contrived war on terror. The Obama administration never attempted to change this destructive foreign policy. Proof positive, that he was the establishment choice, to deceive the public once again.</p>
<p>In order to understand better the planned collapse review a short list of Obama’s fiascos: <a href="http://obamalies.net/list-of-obamas-failures">List of Obama’s Failures</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s hard to think of a president that has been more of an Epic Failure than President Obama. Even Carter is glad this guy came along, so at least he knows he is no longer the worst president ever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this an accident or is it more probable that these catastrophes are designed circumstances?</p>
<p>For the rest of Obama’s term, he will at best be a crippled conveyor of confusion. If the elites truly want to implode the remains of a functional economy and collapse any checks and balances institutions left in the system, having a caretaker President in charge would be delightful. In anticipation of a substitute replacement organism, the elites have the ideal fall guy in the man with no birth records. Who needs George W. Bush anymore? We got an improved idiot in Obama.</p>
<p>Four More Insane Years of <a href="http://obamalies.net/">Obama Lies</a> illustrates facts that must be denied by the Obama toadies. &#8220;With the re-election of Barack Obama, the United States has officially become a banana republic. From a nation that produced patriots like Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy, we have knowingly selected the lowest common denominator as our commander in chief.&#8221;Now if you are really up to the challenge a <a href="http://obamalies.net/list-of-lies/lliesub">list of Obama’s documented lies</a> so far with the most recent lies first, will make your day.</p>
<p><img alt="obama_lies.jpg" src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/obama_lies.jpg.w300h226.jpg" width="300" align="Left" /></p>
<p>How long do lies work, even when told to a dumb downed public? Answer &#8211; probably as long as the spin deflects from the substance of the scandals and failures, while redirecting responsibility, using false flags diversions for the rapid decline in personal well-being from the masses.</p>
<p>Back to the effectiveness assessment, ultimately this is the standard that Obama is evaluated by from the perspective of the best long-term interests for the globalists that put him in office.</p>
<p>During this window of opportunity of a weaken POTUS, the great diversity of activist organizations and ideological opponents of a fascist state need to network and work towards applying maximum pressure on the plunderers of power.</p>
<p>In the spirit of this effort, a weekly BATR RealPolitik Newsletter is available by email. <a href="http://eepurl.com/ESQ5L">Subscription sign-up</a> is required with an opt-in approval. Strike while the iron is hot. Contribute ideas and start your own organizational projects that draw in and motivate your own circle of friends and contacts.</p>
<p>Now is the time for serious grassroots activism. For those who see improved prospects and look to the 2014 Congressional and Senate elections, the time to recruit primary challengers is now. Those who are far more cynical and pragmatic about the way truth to power actually functions, should organize serious lobbying and pressure group strategies.</p>
<p>The odds of success may be long but the prospects of meaningful change are nil without active involvement. Acceptability of mass civil disobedience needs to go mainstream.</p>
<p>Implosion is not a &#8220;<em>To Be or Not To Be</em>&#8221; personal dilemma choice. It is a societal and existential reality. Even if the crippled system crawls along, the pattern of <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/">Totalitarian Collectivism</a> goes on uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Seldom are the prospects of disrupting the establishment more promising than when a sitting President is backed down through the communal voice of disgusted citizens. Let us all hope that another insane foreign adventure has been derailed, but without continuous persistency, an averted attack on Syria may well be a temporary victory.</p>
<p>A botched Obama administration causes harm to everyone, except to the top tier sociopaths that just accumulate more control and power. The toppling of their agenda and timetable can launch the tumbling of their best-laid plans.</p>
<p>Engaging a pro Obama supporter in discourse much less serious dialogue is a painful experience. Their denial is their badge of identity. Our synergism of commonality should emphasis a non-intervention foreign policy, a vigorous pro civil liberty defense and fundamental revamping of the debt created money, legal tender, financial banksters fraudulent system.</p>
<p>These three areas of mutual benefit are strategic and indispensible in developing a massive re-alignment of the body politic. Resisting the trap of &#8220;<em>gotye politics</em>&#8221; is a difficult task for political junkies. However, the practice of divide and conquer, has persisted far too long, and is a major impediment for true representative government based upon natural rights and democratic principles.</p>
<p>The prospects of the next three plus years can become a battlefield for a historic confrontation with the old regime. The <a href="http://forum.batr.net/showthread.php?tid=6&amp;highlight=old+right">Old Right</a> needs to become the new home for frustrated patriots as well as disgruntled Obama boosters. Is it not time to build upon the retreat of incompetent government with a positive initiative?</p>

<p>When is a bank an appendage of state? In China, the incorporation of commercial banking under the auspice of governmental policy is virtually indistinguishable. Philosophically, any government should have control of their currency and structure the precepts of banking and lending system. Capitalist banking would command a greater pragmatic function if competition among banks was based upon free enterprise. However, under the central banking scheme governments regulate banks, but are creatures of fractional reserve debt money issued by central bank parentage. The Chinese way has included a touch of mystery when analyzed within the context of western international banking.</p>
<p>How did a communist economic model transform into a partner of the globalist banksters cabal? Setting the political questions aside, the business of building an economy requires the acquisition of money on a scale that most societies are unable to access. The difference in the Great Wall nation became the favorite police state pattern for the corporatists to move their manufacturing facilities that grew a trading surplus, which accrued huge sums. China alone has amassed official reserves of <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Challenges_for_central_banks_wider_powers_greater_restraints/$FILE/Challenges_for_central_banks_wider_powers_greater_restraints.pdf">US$3.2 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>Translate this occurrence into a banking advantage would have you believe that Forbes’ reporting is correct. Written earlier this year, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2012/04/19/red-banks-rising-will-china-become-the-worlds-banker/">Red Banks Rising: Will China Become The World&#8217;s Banker?</a>, has a Sino banking buy spree in full motion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In February China’s central bank issued a three-step plan that would tear down the barriers surrounding China’s big banks. Hopes quickly emerged that China’s banks could become international players much like China’s industrial companies, providing capital to a global economy that could use it. &#8220;Chinese banks are well positioned to follow Chinese companies abroad and provide financing; the question is whether they will also provide services to foreign companies,&#8221; says Ben Simpfendorfer, a Hong Kong-based consultant. &#8220;China would benefit from exporting its cash, and the rest of the world would benefit, especially foreign buyers of Chinese goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the most part the only Chinese financial firms putting serious money to work internationally are driven by Beijing’s politics. China Development Bank, a policy institution, has done some big deals in Africa and lent $10 billion to Petroleo Brasileiro, Brazil’s state-run oil company. There have been signs, however, that China’s big commercial banks are preparing to go global, too. ICBC has been opening and buying branches from New York to the Netherlands and last year paid $600 million for assets of Standard Bank in Argentina. It is now hiring scores of bankers in Brazil. &#8220;The Chinese banks will play a larger role internationally than they have in the past,&#8221; says John Weinshank, the corporate finance chief at China Construction Bank’s New York branch, which built a $2 billion loan book in two years. &#8220;That’s the plan. I can assure you we will be expanding in the Americas over the next two years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A second establishment flagship publisher, The Economist presents a viewpoint that a <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21584331-four-worlds-biggest-lenders-must-face-some-nasty-truths-giant-reality-check">Giant reality-check</a>, is on the horizon, <em>Four of the world’s biggest lenders must face some nasty truths.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;CHINA’S banks are not real banks,&#8221; says Andrew Rothman of CLSA, a broker recently acquired by China’s CITIC Securities. The country’s biggest financial institutions are so closely held by the state that they are, in effect, arms of the treasury. Cosseted by rules that protect them from competition, they deliver huge profits in good times: bank profits as a share of China’s economic output equalled nearly 3% last year, whereas the highest ratio achieved in recent decades by American banks was only 1% of GDP (in 2006). In bad times the state is there to clean up, just as it did during a surge in dud loans in 1990s.</p>
<p>But the bargain that has driven China’s &#8220;Big Four&#8221; banks to the top of the global league tables is breaking down. Profitable though they are now, another wave of non-performing loans will soon hit them. As the Chinese economy rebalances, the state is less willing than it was in the past to pour credit into state-owned enterprises (SOEs) at the expense of households and private firms. Mr Rothman’s epithet will not hold forever. China’s big banks are slowly becoming real institutions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While the Chinese banks are adapting to international commerce circumstances, the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan">Chinese yuan</a> does not have a reserve currency function has allowed the state-controlled regime to enjoy foreign exchange benefits that other countries resent. The day is coming, when fundamental rescaling of the world banking system, will alter the way that Chinese banks operate. The accounting firm of Ernest and Young presents the following view in a report, <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Challenges_for_central_banks_wider_powers_greater_restraints/$FILE/Challenges_for_central_banks_wider_powers_greater_restraints.pdf">Challenges for central banks: wider powers, greater restraints</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Emerging countries’ greater importance to the world economy has generated criticism of Western monetary policy and led to calls for some kind of international monetary reform. One of the strongest proponents of such reform is China. On the one hand, the capital restrictions and the state-controlled finance system enabled the Chinese authorities to partly shield the country from the worst effects of the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 and to engineer a remarkable, if inflationary, stimulus. On the other hand, these same factors mean that China, in the words of Jin Liqun, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of China’s sovereign fund, China Investment Corporation, is the only one of the six biggest world economies that does not have its own international currency.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Having it their way, while everyone else is shackled to floating currency convertibility, means that China’s state protecting racket will break down if a reserve currency role is eventually implemented. Since at this stage it is impossible to separate state control from business risk lending, the future of the top ten Chinese Banks are dependent upon the way the financial community navigates within the treacherous waters of the China Sea.</p>
<p>If the prototype of Chinese banking, with a reciprocal relation under the wing of state direction forecasts international banking, just what will the banksters do with the loss of their preeminence. If the past is a reliable gauge, bidding against the moneychangers is a tall order.</p>

</div>
<p>With the constant drumbeat that Armageddon is imminent, it is easy to dismiss the geopolitical threats that pose a <a href="http://batr.org/realpolitik.html">realpolitik</a> danger. The prospects that definite weapons of mass destruction will engulf the planet in a nuclear winter are upon us once again. After the collapse of the Soviet evil empire, the Reagan &#8211; Gorbachev détente provided the world with one of its last hopes for restoring rational international relations. Regretfully, the last superpower used the defeat of the Marxist model of tyranny to impose their Pax American version of a global New World Order. The military machine of NATO, furnished with DARPA technology, would implement the NeoCon policy based upon the interest of the true masters behind the <em>kosher</em> approved empire. Justin Raimondo poses the question: <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2013/06/02/are-we-on-the-brink-of-world-war-iii/">Are We On the Brink of World War III?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The end of the cold war did not lead to a &#8220;unipolar world,&#8221; as Charles Krauthammer and his fellow neocons celebrated it in the early 1990s. Instead of the &#8220;benevolent global hegemony&#8221; envisioned by Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan in their nineties foreign policy manifesto, we are back to the pre-WWI era of old-fashioned inter-imperialist rivalry. Instead of the &#8220;end of history,&#8221; we stand at the beginning of a new era of nationalism, religious fanaticism, and ideologically-driven violence. Combined with the structural incentives for conflict inherent in our system of alliances and the built-in dangers of a policy of &#8220;collective security,&#8221; this is a recipe for another world war.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The compulsion of the Neoconservatives toward belligerent intervention never serves the interests or enhances the security of the American citizenry. So when <a href="http://www.eutimes.net/2011/12/china-joins-russia-orders-military-to-prepare-for-world-war-iii/">China Joins Russia, Orders Military To Prepare For World War III</a>, what is really behind the rhetoric?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hu’s call for war joins Chinese Rear Admiral and prominent military commentator Zhang Zhaozhong who, likewise, <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/chinese-admiral-threatens-world-war-to-protect-iran-154434.html">warned this past week that</a>: &#8220;China will not hesitate to protect Iran even with a Third World War,&#8221; and Russian General Nikolai Makarov who <a href="http://www.zimbabwemetro.com/?p=30650">grimly stated last week</a>: &#8220;I do not rule out local and regional armed conflicts developing into a large-scale war, including using nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>From the Trenches attempts to answer this question in the article, <a href="http://www.fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/is-china-gearing-up-to-start-world-war-iii/21974">Is China gearing up to start World War III?</a> <em>&#8220;My take on this is that China’s latest foray into international threat-mongering is indicative of two factors: a desire on the part of the Chinese government to be prepared for any eventuality — and that could include war — and a desire to warn the West that they’re willing to be prepared for any eventuality — and that could include war.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>With this backdrop in mind, the buzz from the seminal Paul Craig Roberts essay, <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2013/07/24/the-two-faux-democracies-threaten-life-on-earth-paul-craig-roberts/">The Two Faux Democracies Threaten Life On Earth</a>, lays out the hubris that underpins this updated vision in the MAD doctrine of victory. Deterrence be dammed, mutually assured destruction is pointless, when preempted aggression has the war machine of absolute annihilation under your command. Dr. Roberts concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The post World War II wars originate in Washington and Israel. No other country has imperial expansionary ambitions. The Chinese government has not seized Taiwan, which China could do at will. The Russian government has not seized former constituent parts of Russia, such as Georgia, which, provoked by Washington to launch an attack, was instantly overwhelmed by the Russian Army. Putin could have hung Washington’s Georgian puppet and reincorporated Georgia into Russia, where it resided for several centuries and where many believe it belongs.</p>
<p>For the past 68 years, most military aggression can be sourced to the US and Israel. Yet, these two originators of wars pretend to be the victims of aggression. It is Israel that has a nuclear arsenal that is illegal, unacknowledged, and unaccountable. It is Washington that has drafted a war plan based on nuclear first strike. The rest of the world is correct to view these two rogue unaccountable governments as direct threats to life on earth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AWXjo94d4wk" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWXjo94d4wk">US Now Determined Highest Priority To Nuclear First Strike China</a>, provides details and perspective on a provision in NDAA authorization.</p>
<p>This chilling first strike war plan, disclosed in the frightening report - <a href="http://yalejournal.org/2013/06/12/who-authorized-preparations-for-war-with-china/">Who Authorized Preparations for War with China?</a> – has to send shivers up the spine of any thinking person. &#8220;The United States is preparing for a war with China, a momentous decision that so far has failed to receive a thorough review from elected officials, namely the White House and Congress. This important change in the United States’ posture toward China has largely been driven by the Pentagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the author of this paper, Amitai Etzioni, states, &#8220;I am not arguing that the U.S. military is seeking out war or intentionally usurping the role of the highest civilian authorities&#8221;, the intentional preparation for a pre-empt <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> nuke attack is absurd on its face.</p>
<p>However, placing the blame for this switch in strategic targeting that have China in the cross hair alignment has a direct connection to the Zhang Zhaozhong comments in defense of Iran. If you take away anything from this assessment heed the reality of Zionist dominance and foremost influence on American foreign policy that Paul Craig Roberts identifies so clearly.</p>
<p>China does not want an apocalyptic war with the United States. They are content to wage economic and financial warfare. Notwithstanding the trade dependency that the globalist cabal originated by the Nixon-Kissinger tools with the Red Communists, the authoritarian People&#8217;s Republic of China, are winning the financial battle.</p>
<p>Max Hastings in the MailOnline article, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2066380/Will-World-War-III-U-S-China.html">Will World War III be between the U.S. and China?</a>, correctly concludes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Beyond mere sabre-rattling, China is conducting increasingly sophisticated cyber-warfare penetration of American corporate, military and government computer systems. For now, their purpose seems exploratory rather than destructive.</p>
<p>But the next time China and the United States find themselves in confrontation, a cyber-conflict seems highly likely. The potential impact of such action is devastating, in an era when computers control almost everything.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If the actual existential national security of the United States is at stake from a Chinese military combat threat, one had better remember the faithful wisdom of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/02/25/gates-never-fight-a-land-war-in-asia/">General Douglas MacArthur</a> &#8220;<em>Never Fight a Land War in Asia</em>&#8220;. Could the lesson of the failed Iraqi and Afghanistan wars finally be sinking in? Surely, the military-industrial-complex ignored the cogent field marshal’s insight in Viet Nam. Heretofore, the foreign affairs and armed forces geniuses preparing their Sino war plans must be looking to their robot drone battalions for their sneak Amerikan &#8220;Pearl Harbor&#8221; mission.</p>
<p>The dirty little secret is out as <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/chuck-hagel-troops-close-breaking-point-94584.html?hp=l11">Chuck Hagel warns: Troops are ‘close to the breaking point’</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our people are strong and resilient after 12 years of war, but they are under stress — and so are the institutions that support them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strengthening readiness will ultimately demand that we address unsustainable growth in personnel costs, which represent half of the department’s budget and crowds out vital spending on training and modernization,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If trends continue, we could ultimately be left with a much smaller force that is well-compensated but poorly trained and equipped. That would be unacceptable.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Logical, is it not? Just push a few buttons and use those Trident missiles, while you have the advantage. How else can a dying empire survive unless by waging war?</p>
<p>How outrageous and idiotic this government has become for even having a discussion on starting a nuclear war. Before his railroading and incarceration, <a href="http://forum.batr.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=200">Edgar Steele</a> wrote the essay, <a href="http://rense.com/general72/ww3.htm">World War 3</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The world economy is so broken due to plundering by International bankers and other Zionist elite that Depression II is inevitable. Just like WWII and Depression I, WWIII will be the only way to distract people from their impending economic misery, mask the effects of Depression II and get economies going again. Just like WWII and Depression I, international bankers and other Zionist elite will be the real beneficiaries by loaning and selling to all sides and once again scooping up small businesses, farms and residences for one-tenth their value.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another major war is on the horizon, but whether it will be a global conflagration is yet, proven. Revelations final conflict will come to pass, but the time of its occurrence is not known to man. How ironic and ludicrous those planners are looking to copy a disastrous Yamamoto strategy and have the arrogance to believe that they are omniscient.</p>
<p>A useful analogy compares the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Daleks">Daleks</a>, a fictional extraterrestrial race of mutants from the British TV Doctor Who series, with the satanic globalist death merchants that thrive on human suffering and ruin. This tribe of moneychangers, bent on universal conquest and destruction, has brought down countless societies.</p>
<p>The Chinese capitalists’ <em>nouveau riche</em> never lost their repressive attitude and undemocratic culture towards their ‘coolie class&#8221;. That is a trait, which coincides with their globalist gangster partners. Allowing a Hiroshima radiation of Chinese joint venture assets does not advance the final subjugation of the planet, for the fascist corporatists. Ever since Zionism conquered the United States, this country has been ruled under Talmud precepts that only benefit the NWO master plan.</p>

			<p><img src="http://veracityvoice.com/images/medicalmafia-3.jpg" alt="" />More than two-thousand years ago Hippocrates was the first physician to issue a word of caution about the over-use of medicines. Hippocrates invoked an oath to “first do no harm” before doctors reach for the latest nostrum.</p>
<p>In 1976 Austrian philosopher and Catholic priest Ivan Illich, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0714529931/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=lewrockwell&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0714529931&amp;adid=1STADPGEJCPRN08JWH7T&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lewrockwell.com%2F%3Fpost_type%3Darticle%26p%3D443326%26preview%3Dtrue" target="_blank"><strong><em>Medical Nemesis</em></strong></a>, launched what was then considered <em>“the gravest health hazard we face today: our medical system.”</em></p>
<p>Illich was unforgiving. The first sentence in his text reads: <em>“The medical establishment has become a major threat to health.”</em> His second sentence: <em>“The disabling impact of professional control over medicine has reached the proportions of an epidemic.”</em> Readers needn’t have read another sentence but to obtain the details.</p>
<p>Illich went on to say: <em>“The public has been alerted to the perplexity and uncertainty of the best among its hygienic caretakers…. the pioneers of yesterday’s so-called breakthroughs warn their patients against the dangers of the miracle cures they have only just invented.”</em></p>
<p>Illich didn’t suggest the public panic over this revelation but rather that public discussion ensue. Illich thought <em>“the layman and not the physician has the potential perspective and effective power to stop the current iatrogenic (physician-caused) epidemic.”</em></p>
<p>Illich concluded that the misdirection of modern medicine <em>“can be reversed only through a recovery of the will to self-care among the laity, and through the legal, political and institutional recognition of the right to care, which imposes limited upon the professional monopoly of physicians.”</em></p>
<p>That self-care revolution never happened. Ivan Illich’s urgent plea for the public to back away from <em>“cut, burn and poison”</em> medicine was not heeded. The practice of medicine has become more complex and more beyond the reach of the laity to understand it. Just run to the doctor for what ails you is the order of the day.</p>
<h4>Confessions of a Medical Heretic</h4>
<p>Then in 1979 came Dr. Robert S. Mendesohn’s memorable text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809241315/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=lewrockwell&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0809241315&amp;adid=1H9B5XS995F26YYYB44X&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lewrockwell.com%2F%3Fpost_type%3Darticle%26p%3D443326%26preview%3Dtrue" target="_blank"><strong><em>Confessions Of A Medical Heretic</em></strong></a>.”</p>
<p>It took a lot for Dr. Mendelsohn to become a medical heretic. He says he failed to be suspicious of oxygen therapy for prematurely born infants even when 90% of all low birth-weight infants became partially or totally blind (in less advanced hospitals where oxygen therapy was not practiced, the incident of blindness among preemies was ~10%).</p>
<p>He dutifully prescribed Terramycin for respiratory infections which was said to produce no side effects until it was realized this antibiotic did little for this type of infection and left thousands of children with yellow-green teeth and tetracycline deposits in their bones.</p>
<p>Dr. Mendelsohn confessed to his belief in the irradiation of tonsils under the mistaken assumption doses of radiation used were harmless. A decade later thyroid tumors were cropping up among those irradiated patients.</p>
<p>Over time Dr. Mendelsohn became a full-blown medical heretic. He said: <em>“Despite all the super technology and elite bedside manner that’s supposed to make you feel about as well cared for as an astronaut on the way to the moon, the greatest danger to your health is the doctor who practices modern medicine.”</em></p>
<p>Mendelsohn went on to boldly say “that more than ninety percent of modern medicine could disappear from the face of the earth – doctors, hospitals, drugs and equipment – and the effect on our health would be immediate and beneficial.”</p>
<p>How prophetic Dr. Mendelsohn was. His words are so descriptive of the present predicament.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“If you make the mistake of going to the doctor with a cold or the flu, he’s liable to give you antibiotics, which are not only powerless against colds and flu but which leave you more likely to come down with worse problems.”</em></p>
<p><em>“If your child is a little too peppy for his teacher to handle, your doctor may go too far and turn him into a drug dependent.”</em></p>
<p><em>“If you’re foolish enough to make that yearly visit for a routine examination… the doctor’s very presence could raise your blood pressure enough so that you won’t go home empty handed. Another life ‘saved’ by antihypertensive drugs. Another sex life down the drain, since more impotence is caused by drug therapy than by psychological problems.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Mendelson launched a war against modern medicine and said <em>“you can tell when you’re winning this war when you influence those closest to you.”</em></p>
<p>That war has been lost. Most people who embrace natural medicine and shun doctors are outcasts in their own families.</p>

<h4>Does the Written Word Make an Impact Any Longer?</h4>
<p>Does the written word change the course of humanity? Certainly the Bible has. Martin Luther’s 95 Theses did. But none of the texts cited above made even a dent in the “progress” of modern medicine’s assault against humanity.</p>
<p>A few years back someone cited these <a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2006/07/21/the-book-on-books/" target="_blank">facts about book reading</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-third of high school graduates never read another book for the rest of their lives.</li>
<li>58% of the US adult population never reads another book after high school.</li>
<li>42% of college graduates never read another book.</li>
<li>80% of US families did not buy or read a book last year.</li>
<li>70% of US adults have not been in a bookstore in the last five years.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pervasiveness of electronic methods of communication and the dissemination of propaganda and distorted reality of television has changed the course of history itself.</p>
<p>For example: “Television news” said the Gulf of Tonkin happened (no, there was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HODxnUrFX6k" target="_blank">never any North Vietnam boat that shot at a US Navy ship</a>), but off to war America went against a tiny nation the size of the State of Georgia and a population of just 16 million against a country of 200 million with advanced military weapons. Vietnam won.</p>
<p>The news media helped to fabricate the public’s perception of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2013/04/richard-charnin/the-mysterious-deaths-of-jfk-murder-witnesses/" target="_blank">Investigators who dared to stray into what really went occurred on that November day in 1963 suddenly died</a>.</p>
<p>And so too, American news media, whose boards of directors are often laced with executives of pharmaceutical and health insurance companies and hospital chains, continues to almost copy word-for-word press releases issued by the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control, Food &amp; Drug Administration that serve as a front for the racketeering going on in medicine today.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2011/08/bill-sardi/victory-over-a-phony-flu-vaccination-campaign/" target="_blank">2009 flu epidemic was never an epidemic</a>. It was all fabricated by the Centers for Disease Control to help sell flu vaccines.</p>
<h4>Belittle the Competition</h4>
<p>A secondary agenda is to use the news media to demean and belittle any competition posed by healthy diets or dietary supplements. Why promote a low-carbohydrate diet when the next prescription diet pill garners millions of advertising dollars for TV networks?</p>
<p>A spate of recent news reports are now scaring Americans away from vitamin and herbal supplements at a time when millions of Americans suffer from conditions that are simply nutrient deficiencies. It is an orchestrated effort against self-care.</p>
<p>CODEX, a regulatory body assembled by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, has just <a href="http://www.thenhf.com/article.php?id=3652" target="_blank">voted to water down vitamin requirements in foods, thus ensuring a certain level of disease to treat</a>.</p>
<h4>We Need Diseases to Create Jobs</h4>
<p>Government sees the medical industry as a source of jobs as the population ages. Why cure or prevent any chronic age-related diseases when a certain level of disease is needed to maintain jobs? Health care costs are not deemed to be an expense but rather an industry that contributes to the Gross Domestic Product. In reality, it is a $3 trillion drag on the economy that has not produced greater life expectancy (US life expectancy ranks 27th out of 34 countries deemed to be economic peers). Life expectancy in some US counties is <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/domesticpolicy/life-expectancy-in-some-u-s-counties-is-no-better-than-in-the-third-world-20130710" target="_blank">no better than some third-world countries</a>.</p>
<p>The masses have little choice because they have no money. An estimated <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-05-27/40-frightening-facts-fall-us-economy" target="_blank">53% of American workers make no more than $30,000 a year</a> and the growth in part-time jobs is soaring above full-time employment. A $30,000 annual salary may have been adequate in 1980 but due to inflation one would have to make $85,000 to have the <a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/" target="_blank">same purchasing power today</a>. The people have no money to make choices outside those served up by the health insurance/ physician/ Big Pharma/ hospital chain cabal. Fascist (industry-controlled) medicine prevails.</p>
<p>For now, it’s every man for himself.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/LuciferianOccultism3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/LuciferianOccultism2.jpg" align="left" /></a>In &#8220;<em>Why Some Scientists Embrace the &#8216;Multiverse</em>,&#8221; Dennis Prager reports that he recently participated, along with 30 scholars, mostly scientists and mathematicians, in a conference on the question of whether the universe was designed, or at least fine-tuned to make life possible, especially intelligent life. Participants — from Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Berkeley and Columbia among other American and European universities — included agnostics, atheists and believers in God.  (Prager, Jewish World Review, June 18, 2013)</p>
<p>Though the clear scientific consensus was that, at the very least, the universe is exquisitely fine-tuned to allow for the possibility of life said Prager, many atheist scientists and fellow-travelers who insist there be no Creator God put forward the notion of a multiverse despite there being not a shred of evidence for the existence of these universes.  </p>
<p>The multiverse hypothesis is a desperate grasp at the fantasy theory first proposed by David Deutsch in his book, &#8220;<em>The Fabric of Reality</em>.&#8221;  Deutsch&#8217;s theory posits the existence of an infinite number of parallel universes in the vain hope that in at least one of them, conscious life and order arose by pure chance, meaning that living beings created themselves.</p>
<p> Eminent quantum theorist John Polkinghorne utterly rejects the multiverse nonsense:</p>
<p> &#8220;<em>Let us recognize these speculations for what they are.  They are not physics, but&#8230;.metaphysics.  There is no purely scientific reason to believe in an ensemble of universes&#8230;.To my mind greater economy and elegance would be that this one world is the way it is because it is the creation of the will of a Creator who purposes that it should be so</em>.&#8221; (Cosmos, Creator and Human Destiny, Dave Hunt, p. 209)</p>
<p> Multiverse speculations, as Polkinghorne pointed out, are not physics but metaphysics, and in fact are grounded in a two-fold neo-Gnostic vision.  First, that living beings created themselves from pre-existing or spontaneously generated matter, and second, the age-old technology of alchemy and its magical meaning: the ancient Egyptian Hermetic principle of the macrocosm&#8217;s correlation with the microcosm, “<em>As above, so below</em>” symbolized by the Ouroboros&#8212;the great chain of being, cosmic tree of life or with Darwin the tree of life.</p>
<p>In modern Luciferian theosophical thought for example, the Ouroboros ‘above’ corresponds to a number of different astral planes and sub-planes comprising the habitations,</p>
<p>&#8220;(of all) <em>supernatural entities, the locale of gods and demons, the void where the thoughtforms dwell, the region inhabited by spirits of the air and other elements, and the various heavens and hells with their angelic and demonic hosts&#8230;.With the help of ritual procedures, trained persons believe that they can &#8216;rise on the planes,&#8217; and experience these regions in full awareness</em>.&#8221; <i>(&#8220;Beyond the Body: The Human Double and the Astral planes</i>, Benjamin Walker, 1974, pp. 117-8)</p>
<p>The Ouroboros with its astral planes is well-known around the world in its&#8217; many esoteric traditions:</p>
<p><em>“References to this reality are the Dreaming of the Australian Aborigines, the Spirit-world of Shamanism, the Duart of the ancient Egyptians, the Bardo (Intermediate State) of the Tibetans, the Imaginal world of Islamic Esotericism &#8211; e.g. the Barzakh (Interworld) or of Suhrawardi and the Mithal (Imaginal realm) of Ibn Arabi &#8211; the Universe of Asiyah of some Kabbalists, or of Yetzirah according to others.  Other descriptions are the Nervo degree of the Physical State of Theon, the Astral or 2nd Prakritic plane (corresponding to the Linga Sharira or Subtle or Astral body) and the Kama (Desire-Plane) of Blavatsky, the Astral Plane of the Adyar school of Theosophy and of popular occultism, Rudolf Steiner&#8217;s &#8220;Soul World&#8221;; and the Vital and Subtle Physical described by Sri Aurobindo and Mirra.  These are just a few of the innumerable descriptions of this plane of existence.” </em>(The Astral Plane, <a href="http://kheper.net/" target="_blank">kheper.net</a>)</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul speaks not of cosmic trees, astral planes and the beings supposedly existing there but of fallen angels, the &#8220;<em>spirits of wickedness under the heavens&#8221;</em> (Eph. 6:12) and their chief, &#8220;<em>the prince of the powers of the air</em>.&#8221; (Eph. 2:2)  </p>
<p>According to Paul, fallen angels are dispersed in a multitude throughout the whole blue expanse of sky which is visible to us&#8212;the dwelling place for the host of fallen angels who have been cast down from heaven.    This means that in esoteric multiverse theories and occult cosmic tree of life conceptions, the whole blue expanse of sky under the heavens where fallen angels dwell is the Ouroboros/cosmic tree ‘above’ consisting of astral planes and sub-planes connected by the great chain of being up which the initiate spiritually ascends (evolves) by way of ritual (i.e., transcendental meditation, mind-altering drugs) as he traverses the occult Path of Life or Western Magical Way to reach divine status and gain psychic powers.  </p>
<p>Royal Astronomer Lord Martin Rees champions multiverse conceptions in the hope that in at least one or more of them living beings created themselves who are far more advanced than our own life-forms.  Rees believes that if this is the case, then super-intelligent aliens might be capable of simulating in their brains or in a super-computer the complex history of our universe, meaning the universe we inhabit is a simulation lacking real substance and existing only as a mental construction, a matrix, in the minds of highly evolved aliens who seeded our world with life and travel through time in order to control man’s evolutionary progress. (<em>Scientific Mythologies</em>, James A. Herrick, p. 216)</p>
<p>The idea that the universe we inhabit exists only as a mental construction is very similar to Hinduism&#8217;s Brahman. Brahman is the Great Cosmic Spirit&#8212; the Ultimate One Substance (prakriti matter) or Essence of material phenomena, meaning that the universe exists only as a mental construction in the mind of Brahman: <em>brahma satyam jagan mithya, or &#8220;Brahman is real, the world is unreal.&#8221; (<a href="http://swamij.com/mahavakyas" target="_blank">swamij.com/mahavakyas</a>)</em></p>
<p>Rees proposal is also similar to the hypothesis presented by Olaf Stapledon, a scientist who has always kept one foot firmly planted in neo-Gnostic science fiction accounts and imagines our universe to be an artifact of the Star Maker.  Building off of Stapledon&#8217;s fantasy Carl Sagan suggests that we are &#8220;<em>star folk</em>&#8221; made of &#8220;<em>star stuff</em>.&#8221;    (Herrick, pp. 216-217)</p>
<p>Replace Star Maker with Brahman and &#8220;<em>star stuff</em>&#8221; with <em>sarvam khalvidam brahma</em>, or &#8220;<em>All is truly Brahman</em>&#8221; (<a href="http://swamij.com/" target="_blank">swamij.com</a>) and we have <em>ayam atma brahmam:</em> &#8220;<em>The Self is Brahman</em>.&#8221; (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5)</p>
<p>In the caption of his book, “<i>Just Six Numbers</i>,” Rees reveals the ancient occult basis of his propositions:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The ouraboros. There are links between the microworld of particles, nuclei and atoms and the cosmos.&#8221; (</em>Rees M<em>., Just Six Numbers, P. 9)</em></p>
<p><b>&#8220;<em>Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field</em></b><i>…&#8221;</i> — Genesis 3:1</p>
<p>As a powerful occult symbol, the Ouroboros or Uroboros means the seething power, creative and/or evolutionary impulse or energy of the serpent figuratively depicted as either a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.  The serpent&#8217;s body is often depicted as the Great Chain of Being, Cosmic Tree of Life, or with Darwin, the Tree of Life.  </p>
<p> The occult Tree of Life with its&#8217; multiple dimensions and life-giving energy systems not only powers the universe but reaches into the psyche, stirring imagination, bringing psychic powers and even awakening pre-human memories of when the scientifically &#8220;enlightened occult elite,” the Gnostikoi, were fish:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Remember when you were a fish</em>&#8230;.&#8221; suggested Jean Houston, the prophet of the possible, in a workshop to awaken ancient pre-human memories.  Nearly a thousand evolved life-forms (people) dropped to the floor and began moving their &#8216;fins&#8217; as if to propel themselves through water.  <em>&#8220;Notice your perception as you roll like a fish. How does your world look, feel, sound, smell, taste?&#8221; </em> Then you crawled up on land said Houston, so now you must, &#8220;<em>Allow yourself to fully remember being a reptile&#8230;.Then some of you flew. Others climbed trees.&#8221; </em>  A zoo of beastly sounds erupted from the herd of pre-human birds, reptiles and apes. (<em>America: The Sorcerer&#8217;s New Apprentice</em>, Hunt and McMahon, p. 218)</p>
<p>From the time of the ancients serpent power has been important to religious and mythological symbolism all around the world. Within the Egyptian mysteries, serpent power was associated with,</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;<em>the elemental forces that were in play before the creation of the world</em>.&#8221; (Carl Teichrib, <em>Gods of Ancient Egypt</em>, p. 182)</p>
<p> In China serpents were spiritually linked with earth and water while in Scandinavian myth a world serpent protected man from cosmic forces of chaos.  The self-described Gnostic Carl Jung interpreted the Ouroboros as having archetypal consubstantiality to the human psyche.    Serpent power is also associated with today&#8217;s occult New Age spirituality as well as Gnosticism, occult Hermetic Kabbalah, Roisicrucianism, Illuminati, Freemasonry and its&#8217; blatantly Luciferian sister, Theosophy, where according to Helena Blavatsky, serpent power represents<em>self-generation and evolution through its own creative power</em><i>. </i></p>
<p>In his book, &#8220;<em>The Sign of the Serpent</em>,&#8221; Mark Balfour relates how pervasive serpent symbols are within India and the Hindu religion:</p>
<p> &#8220;<em>Any observant traveler who moves from the snow-tipped Himalayas in the North to the sun-soaked sands of Cape Comorin at India’s southern tip, will encounter—particularly in the rural areas and at sacred centres of pilgrimage wherever Siva, God of both Divine Wisdom and regeneration, is the presiding Deity—the serpent motif sculptured within shrines, impressed on myriads of stone implants in the ground and depicted in art</em>.&#8221; (<em>A Short Guide to Occult Symbols: Serpent Power</em>, Carl Teichrib, 2005, Kjos Ministries)  </p>
<p>Balfour elaborates on this belief:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>In Hinduism, the Cosmic Serpent—Ananta Sesha—symbolic of timeless eternity, carries the world on his 1000-fold [Cobra] hood…As the creative impulse stirs within the great Serpent in the Sky—when passive idea becomes active thought—the forces of attraction and repulsion come into play as ‘spirit’ begins its involution into &#8220;matter</em>.&#8221; (ibid, Teichrib)</p>
<p>Moreover, Kundalini yoga, a discipline within Hinduism, teaches that latent serpent energy lies at the base of the etheric human spine, </p>
<p>&#8220;…<em>like a coiled serpent, ready to sprin</em>g.&#8221; (<em>Harper&#8217;s Dictionary of Hinduism</em>, p. 156, ibid, Teichrib)  </p>
<p>Through strenuous yoga techniques, this Kundalini serpent power uncoils and rises through seven &#8220;<em>chakras&#8221;</em> or power centers within the human body. The Kundalini serpent force is considered,</p>
<p>&#8220;(to be a) <em>concentrated field of intelligent cosmic, invisible energy absolutely vital to life beginning in the base of the spine as a man or a woman begins to evolve in their first incarnation</em>.&#8221; (<em>The Donning International Encyclopedic Psychic Dictionary,</em> p. 343, ibid, Teichrib)</p>
<p>The serpent power/Masonry connection is revealed by occultist Mason Manly Hall who says that when the Mason learns how to properly channel the power of the serpent he has learned the mystery of his Craft: </p>
<p>“<i>The seething energies of Lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy</i>.” (<i>New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies,</i>William T. Still, p. 30)</p>
<p>In “<i>Occult Theocracy</i>,” Edith Starr Miller elaborates on the serpent power/Masonry connection:</p>
<p>“<i>Luciferian Occultism controls Freemasonry</i> (and) <i>is therefore not a novelty, but it bore a different name in the early days of Christianity.  It was called Gnosticism</i>…” (<i>Occult Theocracy</i>, p. 198, 1933)</p>
<p> Free Masonry is grounded in occult Hermetic Kabbalah, the non-Jewish version of Kabbalah, a syncretic system that draws on Gnosticism, Western astrology, alchemy, ancient Egyptian drom which the alahnry connectionntherefore not a novelty, but it bore a different name in the early days of Chhermeticism, Greco-Roman nature religions, Eastern mysticism/reincarnation/karma, spiritual and biological evolutionary conceptions, neoplatonism, the Enochian system of angelic magic of John Dee and Edward Kelley, rosicrucianism, tantra, and tarot cards, which are seen as keys to the Tree of Life.  </p>
<p>Occult Hermetic Kabbalah is also the underlying philosophy and framework for Western magical societies such as the Golden Dawn, Thelemic orders, mystical-religious societies such as the Builders of the Adytum and is the precursor to the Wiccan, Neopagan and Luciferian New Age spirituality over-taking Western and American civilization.</p>
<p>Regarding the importance of occult Hermetic Kabbalah to Freemasonry, Albert Pike&#8211;the most influential Freemason that has lived&#8212;has this to say in his Morals and Dogma:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The Kabalah is the key to the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists</em>. (<em>Morals and Dogma</em>, p. 626) </p>
<p>The famous scientist, engineer, religious writer and mystic, Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) claimed to have been instructed by beings on other planets as well as by angels during his astral plane travels.  Swedenborg has influenced a long line of scientists, philosophers, modern science fiction writers and movie producers as well as Joseph Smith.  </p>
<p>Swedenborg described Masonry as a search after Light said Pike:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>That search leads us directly back, as you see, to the Kabbalah. In that ancient and little understood medley of absurdity and philosophy, the Initiate will find the source of many doctrines; and may in time come to understand the Hermetic philosophers, the Alchemists, all the Anti-papal Thinkers of the Middle Age, and Emanuel Swedenborg</em>. (<em>Morals and Dogma</em>, p. 741)<em></em></p>
<p>The Gnostic Hermetic Kabbalah holds to the neoplatonic conception that the manifest universe (One Substance) of which material creation is a part, arose as a series of emanations or evolutions from the godhead or divine Cosmic Spirit. </p>
<p>In his <em>Dictionary of Mysticism and the Occult</em>, Nevill Drury writes that the Hermetic Kabbalah&#8217;s Tree of Life consists of ten spheres, <i></i></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>or sephiroth, through which—according to mystical tradition—the creation of the world came about. The sephiroth are aligned in three columns headed by the supernals and together symbolize the process by which the Infinite Light…becomes manifest in the universe</em>.&#8221; (<em>A Short Guide to Occult Symbols: The Tree of Life</em>, Carl Teichrib)</p>
<p> The sephiroth also have a role resembling that of the &#8220;&#8230;<i>charkas</i> [sic] <i>in yoga</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the sephiroth symbolize the consubstantiality or oneness of the initiate&#8217;s intellect with the Divine Substance (i.e., ancient Egyptian Nu, Chaos, Brahman, Omega Point, Singularity) as well as the seething evolutionary energies of Lucifer (Moshiach/Nachash/Gematria) while chakras refer to psychic centers that lie along the spine of the etheric body that awaken<br />
by way of kundalini serpent power yoga.</p>
<p>For the initiate, the deeper meaning of the Hermetic Kabbalah is the Tree of Life (snake’s body) ‘<i>above</i>’ as well as the inward path ‘<i>below</i>’ in which the adept who has mastered the seething energies of Lucifer discovers and experiences the &#8220;inner light&#8221; (also called the divine spark and inner Christ). </p>
<p>In short, Hermetic Kabbalah is a system of Luciferian teachings and evolutionary conceptions which open up the mind and the soul to a new level of understanding from the snake: <em>salvation comes from within.</em></p>
<p>From the Renaissance to our own time, Gnostic Hermetic science packaged as biological and spiritual theories of evolution, various Tree of Life conceptions together with pre-existing or spontaneously generated matter theories, multiverse conceptions, Teilhard’s Omega Point and trans-humanism’s Technological Singularity for example, has swept the post-Christian West and America, even entering into the whole body of the Church.<br />

<b>Luciferian Occultism: Serpent Power</b></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>God and the Knowledge of Reality</em>,&#8221; the Catholic philosopher and historian, Thomas Molnar (1921–2010), writes that during the Renaissance Christian mystics and scholars such as Emanuel Swedenborg discovered Hermetic magic and esoteric Jewish Kabbalah texts which they studied and translated resulting in Hermetic Kabbalah.  Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science&#8212;the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures (and for Swedenborg astral plane traveling) is the best proof of the divinity of Christ.    In other words said Molnar,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…..by the time of the Renaissance the esoteric texts of the first centuries A.D. had acquired in scholarly and humanist circles an unparalleled prestige, confronting as equals the texts held sacred by the church.  In Pico&#8217;s estimation, &#8216;nulla est scientia que nos magis certificet de divinitate Christ quam magia et Cabala&#8217; (there is no science that would prove for us Christ&#8217;s divinity better than magic and the Cabala</em>.)&#8221;  (pp. 78-79)</p>
<p>From then till now, Luciferian occult science has been working steadily toward its’ goal to invert, pervert, and replace the living word of God (Matthew 4:4) beginning with the book of Genesis, the book of beginnings divinely revealed to Moses for our edification and salvation.   As a result, the majority of contemporary Christians no longer know that Genesis is the living Word of God because they have lost contact with the early Church Fathers, the living link between the ancient texts containing God&#8217;s revelation and today&#8217;s esoteric evolutionary imperative.</p>
<p>In their day, just as in our own, many people erroneously interpreted Genesis, especially the first three chapters, as an allegory, denying it has any literal and historic meaning.  Therefore the Church Fathers who wrote on Genesis made a specific point in saying it has literal meaning that we must understand correctly even while explaining that anthropomorphic statements about God describing Him as a man who sits on thrones for example, are to be understood symbolically.</p>
<p>Church Fathers regarded Genesis, especially the first three chapters, as divinely inspired text that tells of actual, historical events and people. St. Cyril of Alexandria for example, wrote that Genesis is divinely inspired and cannot be apprehended rightly without respect for its&#8217; historical meaning:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Those who reject the historical meaning in the God-inspired Scriptures as something obsolete are avoiding the ability to apprehend rightly, according to the proper manner, the things written in them&#8230;whenever some historical events are presented to us by the Holy Scriptures (a) useful search into the historical meaning is appropriate, in order that the God-inspired Scripture be revealed as salvific and beneficial to us in every way</i>.&#8221; (St. Cyril, &#8220;Commentary on the Prophet Isaiah 1,4, PG 70, 192AB)</p>
<p>Church Fathers make the point that the whole of creation, including the soul of man, was brought into existence from non-existence (ex nihilo), not from eternally existing or spontaneously generated matter as ancient and modern evolutionary adherents and Luciferian occultists believe.</p>
<p>On the miraculous creation of the first man Church Father John Chrysostom writes:</p>
<p>“<i>And God formed man of dust from the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul….the inbreathing communicated to the one created out of earth the power of life, and thus the nature of the soul was formed.  What does a living soul mean?  An active soul, which has the members of the body as the implements of its activities, submissive to its will.” </i>(<i>Genesis, Creation, and Early Man</i>, Seraphim Rose, p.215)</p>
<p>Gregory of Nyssa adds:</p>
<p>“<i>The body and the soul were formed at the same time—not one before and the other afterwards</i>…” (ibid, p. 218)</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, the “angel” who spoke with Moses at Sinai, is the Creator.  Foremost of His miracles is creation out of nothing—six acts or days of creation rather than the billions of years of evolutionary alchemical process out of matter:</p>
<p>“<i>The first moment of time is the moment of God’s creative act and of creation’s simultaneous coming to be</i>.” (Philosopher and New Testament scholar William Lane Craig quoted in “<i>If God created the universe, then who created God?’</i> by Jonathan Sarfati, Creation Ministries International)</p>
<p>With Irenaeus, the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo was well established. He also argued that the world (matter) was not coeternal with God:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>But the things established are distinct from Him who has established them, and what [things] have been made from Him who has made them. For He is Himself uncreated, both without beginning and end, and lacking nothing. He is Himself sufficient for this very thing, existence; but the things which have been made by Him have received a beginning&#8230; He indeed who made all things can alone, together with His Word, properly be termed God and Lord; but the things which have been made cannot have this term applied to them, neither should they justly assume that appellation which belongs to the Creator</i>.&#8221; (&#8220;Is Creatio Ex Nihilo A Post-Biblical Invention? An Examination Of Gerhard May&#8217;s Proposal,&#8221; Paul Copan, Trinity Journal 17.1; Spring 1996)</p>
<p>The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 affirms creation ex nihilo:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>We firmly believe and simply confess that there is only one true God &#8230; the Creator of all things visible and invisible, spiritual and corporeal; who from the very beginning of time by His omnipotent power created out of nothing [de nihilo condidit] both the spiritual beings and the corporeal.&#8221; </i>(ibid, Copan)</p>
<p>On creation ex nihilo, the Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) asserts:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>It pleased God &#8230; in the beginning, to create or make of nothing the world, and all things therein</i>&#8221; (IV.I; ibid)</p>
<p>The divinely inspired Genesis account of creation ex nihilo is a great stumbling block for contemporary Westerners and Americans&#8212;including great numbers of Christian theologians&#8212; brought up with an evolutionary outlook, an antihuman, occult Luciferian/Gnostic materialistic worldview that has left them spiritually and morally impoverished.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;But in his estate shall (Antichrist) honour the God of forces.&#8221; Dan. 11:38</b></p>
<p>Today the Nachash, the occult planetary-elites <i>God of forces</i> has confused, deluded and mesmerized vast numbers of Westerners and Americans.  As the animated seething energy called evolution the <i>God of forces </i>is the principle miracle-producing power of the cosmos. Having transformed the consciousness of his followers, they are no longer the spiritual image-bearers of the living Triune God but evolution’s conscious products who can achieve ever higher levels of consciousness by directing their own evolution.</p>
<p>So complete has the transformation of consciousness been that the <i>God of forces</i> has successfully inverted the order of creation and for increasing numbers of deluded Christians, reversed the direction of Biblical theism. With creation ex nihilo virtually replaced by evolution, it is now believed that men have not fallen from perfection but instead are gradually evolving upward from their ape beginnings toward greater and greater spiritual perfection. Self-perfecting man no longer needs the living, supernatural God as the idea of &#8220;conscious evolution&#8221; means he can save himself, and perhaps even attain god-hood.</p>
<p>As the &#8216;<em>Chris</em>t&#8217; of the hugely popular &#8220;<em>A Course in Miracles</em>&#8221; the <i>God of forces</i> states that there is an &#8220;<em>irresistible Force&#8221;</em> within each person, a<i> </i><em>universal Force</em> that<i> </i>when activated grants unimaginable psychic powers, even immortality.  The &#8216;<em>Christ</em>&#8216; tells New Age leader Barbara Marx Hubbard that on the day of Planetary Pentecost a Planetary Smile will flash across the faces of all people who have accepted the Luciferian Initiation.  There will be <em>&#8220;uncontrollable joy</em>&#8221; that the &#8216;<em>Christ&#8217;</em> describes as the &#8220;<em>joy of Force&#8221;</em> that will <em>&#8220;ripple&#8221;</em>through the one body of humanity.  (&#8220;<em>False Christ Coming: Does Anybody Care?</em> Warren B. Smith, p. 120)</p>
<p>The <i>God of forces</i> who is the serpent power worshipped by mankind from antiquity, the god of Gnostic Masonry, the seething energies of Lucifer, the serpent power of Kundalini yoga, the body of the occult Tree of Life, the Cosmic Spirit of the universe, the Singularity and the Collective who represents <em>self-generation and evolution through its own creative power</em> poses a question to his enthralled worshippers, </p>
<p>&#8220;<em>What if I am not a &#8216;man&#8217; at all, but rather a Force, an &#8216;Energy&#8221; in the universe, that IS the universe, and that is, in fact, All That Is. What if I am The Collective?&#8221;</em> (&#8220;God&#8221; in <em>Conversations with God</em>: Book 3, p. 125, Neale Donald Walsh, ibid Warren B. Smith, p. 122) </p>
<p>Tragically, many people today, including growing numbers of Christians, are being seduced by an occult planetary mythology that grew out of the Renaissance and maintains that man is not fallen, that he is ultimately perfectible through a process of evolution and that through leaps of consciousness he can realize that he is God.   The common thread among all occult Hermetic science, secret societies and esoteric teachings since the Renaissance is a single mind directing the formation of the new religious consciousness.   It is the mind of the same fallen angel who tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden with the words, “<i>Ye shall be as Gods.”</i> (Gen. 3:5)</p>
<p>When finally the man of lawlessness arrives and appears to triumph for a time, in the end it is he whom the Lord Jesus,</p>
<p>“<i>….shall kill with the spirit of his mouth; and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming, him,</i>” (2 Thes. 2:8)</p>

<p>Knowing the accuracy of historical reality is difficult, but accepting the truth in that chronicle is almost impossible for most people to accept. This reluctance to deal with the stark and calculated obliteration of societal freedom is the ultimate curse of the human condition. The denial of the authoritarian plan by elites like the Bilderberg cabal is the equivalent of Satan&#8217;s greatest lie, convincing us he does not exist. Well, the days of casting the smear of conspiracy over any reporting on the secret and hidden conclave of global manipulators, is officially over.</p>
<blockquote><p>At this year&#8217;s Bilderberg conference, for the first time, there will be a <a href="http://bilderberg2013.co.uk/uncategorized/press-office-and-reception-zone/">Press Office</a> - hosted by the Bilderberg Welcoming Committee &#8211; located on the hotel grounds. The aim of the Press Office will be to facilitate the mainstream and alternative media in their coverage of the meeting.There will be liaison officers from the Hertfordshire Constabulary present in the Reception Zone for the duration of the conference.</p>
<p>This is the first officially sanctioned Press Office for the Bilderberg conference, and is a considerable step forward in the relations between the conference and the press.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the dramatic public reversal of deniability of their existence and the acknowledgement that the newly elected leader of the Swedish social-democratic party, <a href="http://explosivereports.com/2013/05/05/swedish-head-of-social-democrats-first-admitted-bilderberg-2013-participant/">Stefan Löfven</a>, will be the guest of Jacob Wallenberg &#8211; a prominent member of the Bilderberg steering committee, Bilderberg confirmation of the decades of reporting by the late <a href="http://americanfreepress.net/?p=10045">Jim Tucker</a> is vindicated.</p>
<p>Additional background and a comparison of <a href="http://batr.org/view/061211.html">How the media covers Bilderberg meetings</a> and <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/021705.html">Bilderberg Propaganda Rules the Planet</a> is worth a review. For a persuasive critique of the investigations and research of Daniel Estulin into the underlying implication of these gatherings, read the entire summary by Stephen Lendman of &#8220;<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-true-story-of-the-bilderberg-group-and-what-they-may-be-planning-now/13808">The True Story of the Bilderberg Group</a>&#8221; and What They May Be Planning Now.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever its early mission, the Group is now &#8220;a shadow world government….threaten(ing) to take away our right to direct our own destinies (by creating) a disturbing reality&#8221; very much harming the public’s welfare. In short, Bilderbergers want to supplant individual nation-state sovereignty with an all-powerful global government, corporate controlled, and check-mated by militarized enforcement.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even more significant is the account of the age-old struggle for global control that can be traced to the <a href="http://explosivereports.com/2012/05/28/ancient-roots-of-bilderberg-reveal-prusso-teutonic-agenda-for-world-domination/">Ancient Roots of Bilderberg Reveal Prusso-Teutonic Agenda for World Domination</a>. Author Jurriaan Maessen provides a provocative analysis.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As Paul Joseph Watson reported in his May 11 2009 article <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/top-nazis-planned-eu-style-fourth-reich.html">Top Nazis Planned EU-Style Fourth Reich</a>, top Nazi industrialists were present at the cradle of the European Union and, through the creation of the Bilderberg group, guided her growth during all stages of development into the post-war era. German industrialists, it seems, have aligned themselves with the Anglo-American establishment after the war, teaming up to form what is better known as the New World Order. As reported in the article, a group of top ranking German industrialists planned for an economic super state founded upon a common market for the whole of Europe. It has also been confirmed that the Bilderberg group had their plans for a European Union and currency in place by at least 1955.The idea of uniting Europe in a closed trade bloc is no longer shocking if Germany assumes domination over such a bloc&#8221;, wrote one of the founding Nazi-ideologues in the 19th century. The man who arranged for Hitler to become Chancellor of Germany, Von Papen, had also written about the possibility of a &#8220;European Federation&#8221; under strict German control of course, with Berlin as its glorious power center.</p>
<p>NATO has provided for the international army, while the European Central Bank does the same for international finance. All these activities have been developed under the careful direction of the Bilderberg Group and subsequently carried out by its designated subdivisions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Authoritarianism is not new to the blue-blood lineage of continental nobility. Millenniums of succeeding empires shared the same ambition &#8211; rule the world.</p>
<p>The next citation provided the linkage that many &#8220;PC&#8221; armchair observers are afraid to deal with.</p>
<p>The David Icke Newsletter argues in the <a href="http://rense.com/general86/zelephant.htm">The Zionist Elephant In The Room</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, Rothschild Illuminati fronts like the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Royal Institute of International Affairs, and others, still answer to the Round Table which string-pulls and coordinates from the shadows. This is why Zionists in government are invariably connected with these Rothschild-controlled organizations.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get this straight. Zionism doesn&#8217;t give a damn about Jewish people. To the Rothschilds and their Zionist gofers and thugs the Jewish people as a whole are merely cattle to be used and abused as necessary &#8211; just like the rest of the human population.</p>
<p>The networks of the House of Rothschild were behind Hitler and the rise of the Nazi Party in the Rothschild heartland of Germany where they had changed their name from Bauer in 18th century Frankfurt and launched the dynasty that was to control global finance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this explanation of the forbidden knowledge that if kept from your scrutiny by the mainstream press, the Bilderberg summits were protected for decades from objective observation of their agenda and strategy for implementing their New World Order absolutism.</p>
<p>The iconoclastic <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=216">Brother Nathanael</a> - Street Evangelist rants, &#8220;One of the Bilderberg’s deceptions is to invite insignificant leaders in the academic &amp; scientific realms as a &#8220;decoy.&#8221; Here Are The Real Players Attending the 2008 Bilderberg &amp; They Are Jewish Bankers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ben Shalom Bernanke: Chairman of the privately held US Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>James Wolfensohn: International Jewish financier. Chairman of Wolfensohn &amp; Company Investments. A former World Bank President, this Jew has more than 140 employees and offices in London, Tokyo and Moscow. Wolfensohn also has a banking partnership with Fuji Bank of Japan and Jacob Rothschild of Britain.</p>
<p>Robert Zoellick: Chairman of the US World Bank Group a covert subsidiary of the Rothschild run International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Josef Ackermann: Chairman of the Executive Committee of Deutsche Bank AG of Zurich Switzerland. Ackermann is a Rothschild partner in white collar crime.</p>
<p>Kenneth Jacobs: Deputy Chairman Head of Lazard Bank North America. Lazard Bank, a Rothschild associate bank, operates in 39 cities throughout North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America.</p>
<p>David Rockefeller: Owner of Chase Manhattan Bank. Former Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations &amp; Founder of the Trilateral Commission. Though not a Jew, Rockefeller is a Rothschild stooge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the relevant viewpoint is that the Bilderberg assembly is by invitation from the highest echelon of committed agents of globalism. Their decisions become policy and governance turns into a continuous decent into slavery. The manifestation of the Bilderberg coalition is in keeping with the <a href="http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2008/06/rhodes-round-table-groups.html">Round Table</a>, a secret society started around the turn of the 20th century by Freemason and Rothschild agent, Lord Alfred Milner, who was entrusted the mission by Cecil Rhodes.The Anglo-American dominance of international intervention is rooted in Bilderberg discussions organized on the principle of reaching consensus for global hegemony. Pro Zionist financiers impose the objectives of the House of Rothschild upon America and England. The origins of totalitarian assimilation under the banner of the centralized authority oppression stems from the cult of the moneychangers.</p>

<p>Keeping informed on the latest schemes of <a href="http://youtu.be/yfi92FGPM1I">Bilderberg 2013 In The UK with Press For Truth</a> by watching the video is a must view. Also, follow the <a href="http://bilderberg2013livestream.blogspot.co.uk/">Bilderberg 2013 Stream page</a> that has several links covering live feeds from the meetings. Finally, the <a href="http://www.infowars.com/b/">Infowars</a>coverage of Bilderberg with <a href="http://www.infowars.com/bilderberg-cancels-hotel-reservations-of-journalists-covering-secret-meeting/">Alex Jones</a> and <a href="http://www.infowars.com/2_bilderberg-fringe-festival-in-effect-banned-by-watford-council-and-police/">David Icke</a> promises to be groundbreaking.Exhaustive arguments and proofs of the cataclysmic consequences coming out of every Bilderberg session encircle our globe with even incremental policy that fosters the New World Order. The names of the elites vary over time, but the globalist authoritarian culture only grows.</p>
<p>The fact that the exposure of the Bilderberg union is gaining traction gives solace to guardians of the human race. The sect of banksters devotion to the mischievous sprite and the dark side cannot force their tyranny on an awakened public dedicated to the defeat of the Illuminati empire.</p>
<p>The first step is to accept the truth that globalism is the engine of national destruction and a world governance substitute, under the control of an aristocratic bloodline, is the existential nihilist end of civilization. The Amschel Moses Rothschild &#8211; Cecil Rhodes vision of competing world dominance has merged into a technocratic intercellular substance of subjugation and extermination.</p>
<p>The days of allowing a massive media cover-up of the actual intentions of the Bilderberg clan are over. The alternative press has the credibility to speak truth to power. The public has the responsibility to mature emotionally and reject the delusional myths that protect the fabricated privileges of evil elites.</p>
<p>The secrecy of secret societies in a global telecommunication environment is doomed. Only with greater levels of planetary oppression, can the controllers of the Bilderberg fraternity maintain their cruel imperium. It is up to the citizens of the world to neuter this lineage of deranged plutocrats.</p>

<p>Hurrah, the worm has turned! Or has it? The corporatist controlled mass media love affair with the puppet spinmeister seems to be on the rocks. For progressive propagandists, the profession of journalism has long sunk into the sewer. Withal, the elitist snobbery of the self-appointed gatekeepers for the globalist power structure got a slap in the face and a wakeup call, from Associated Press spy-gate. The reporter darlings for the Obama “Chicago Outfit” protection racket just got a taste of unexpected payback appreciation. Slow on the uptake, <a href="http://www.jammiewf.com/2013/obama-lapdog-andrea-mitchell-on-irs-scandal-one-of-the-most-outrageous-excesses-ive-seen-in-all-my-years-in-journalism/">Obama Lapdog Andrea Mitchell on IRS Scandal: “One of the most outrageous excesses I’ve seen in all my years in journalism”</a> “Wait until this fossil finds out about AP records being seized.”</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yb4YbqMdXN8" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sentiment typifies the insincere shock from the hypocrites that ignored the criminal pattern of governance for the last four plus years. Just listen to their temper tantrum in the YouTube video, <a href="http://youtu.be/yb4YbqMdXN8">Media turn on Obama in response to AP probe</a>. Oh, woe is I, how can our esteemed profession be treated in such a way by our celebrity creation rock star? How could he betray us, after we covered for him at every turn?</p>
<p>Well, the fact that the &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/view/081212.html">Chicago Gangster Organization</a>&#8221; of the Obama crew targeted the electronic communications of the press should not be a shock in the age of the Patriot Act. The real bombshell is that the <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/congressman-justice-dept-wiretapped-house-representatives-cloak-room_724606.html">Justice Dept. Wiretapped the House of Representative&#8217;s Cloak Room</a>. &#8220;California congressman Devin Nunes made the claim yesterday that the Justice Department wiretapped telephones in the House of Representative&#8217;s Cloak Room, an exclusive part of the Capitol where members are able to privately interact with one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the newly invigorated and hardy souls of the &#8220;Fourth Estate&#8221; become bloodhounds and sniff out the ugly stories behind the headlines? Before the long beleaguered news consumer regains confidence that the muckraker tradition of the<a href="http://washingtonmerry-go-round.blogspot.com/">Washington Merry-Go-Round</a> has returned, consider who really benefits from this miraculous turn of conscience.</p>
<p>Let’s get right down with the despicable truth that most mainstream news is simply a product of disinformation that benefits the shadowy forces that control the editorial content of the spin. Polite company is supposed to ignore that <a href="http://www.zionismexplained.org/media/media.html">Zionism and the Media</a>has an Israel-First agenda in reporting. The direct links of tribe ownership, editorial approval and journalists staffing is simply a fact within the industry.</p>
<p>The linkage of a systemic slanted viewpoint and sympathy for an ideology that conflicts with traditional Americanism is a reality that cannot be denied by any honest observer. Prodigious lies from politicians are expected, but repeating the prevarications, while professing a claim that objective journalism is their trade, is a primary reason whypresstitutes are so despised.</p>
<p>In order to understand the current media scorn towards the Obama regime needs a shot of bold courage for analysis of the geo-political influence that dictates the perspective that goes into print. Since the mass media is a top down cabal of groupthink, it is entirely explicable that some political objective is at the core of the &#8220;so called&#8221; fabricated media outrage.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has demonstrated a reluctance to do the bidding of the most bellicose pro Zionists. The significance that an illegal preempted strike on Iran, a priority for Benjamin Netanyahu&#8217;s ruling coalition, has not received approval from <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/081510.html">Barry Soetoro</a> means that the string is running out on Obama usefulness. Interminable media speculation has been registered about Barack Hussein Muslim sympathies. Leaving the extent of such motivations aside, the critical question is whether a teleprompt reader, tutored by the CIA to become an asset for the agency, is really making foreign policy decisions.Consider that the red line has passed for Obama, and that operations for false flag distractions are firmly in the hands of his controllers. Stripping the imposter in chief of his political capital and placing blame on his inept and gonzo behavior is a natural for the skilled character blackwash of media assassins.</p>
<p>The most reasonable conclusion from an analysis of the sudden turn by a uniform media is that the order, from on high, went forth that ignoring greater Israel interests, has consequences. From none other than the oracle of Zionist supremacy, the New York Times editorial board <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/opinion/spying-on-the-associated-press.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=1&amp;">Spying on The Associated Press</a>, expresses their new found denigration.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For more than 30 years, the news media and the government have used a well-honed system to balance the government’s need to pursue criminals or national security breaches with the media’s constitutional right to inform the public. This action against The A.P., as the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press outlined in a letter to Mr. Holder, &#8220;calls into question the very integrity&#8221; of the administration’s policy toward the press.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The mere mention of the Attorney General from the Department of Injustice, mildly stated is just a little late. &#8220;<a href="http://washingtonmerry-go-round.blogspot.com/search/label/Fast%20And%20Furious">Fast And Furious</a>&#8221; Eric Holder is the poster boy for careerist corruption going back to the <a href="http://www.westernjournalism.com/holder-was-responsible-for-168-deaths-in-the-1995-oklahoma-city-bombingand-more/">Oklahoma City Bombing</a>. Why now is the media turning on an AG that makes one longing for the resurrection to office of John Mitchell?</p>
<p>The POTUS proclaims, <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/05/16/obama-i-have-complete-confidence-in-holder/">I Have ‘Complete Confidence’ In Holder</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;President Barack Obama continues to back Attorney General Eric Holder following the fallout over the Justice Department secretly obtaining two months of telephone records of reporters and editors for The Associated Press.</p>
<p>During a Rose Garden press conference, the president stated that he has &#8220;complete confidence&#8221; in the job Holder is doing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And why would Obama not back his buffoon sibling in law-breaking? <a href="http://freebeacon.com/know-nothing/">Know Nothing</a>Holder is either the minister of incompetence or the sheriff of selective memory.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Attorney General Eric Holder used the phrase &#8220;I don’t know&#8221; or some variation, at least 57 times during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee today as House Republicans grilled him over controversies including the IRS’ targeting of Tea Partiers, the Justice Department’s seizure of journalist phone records, and the security lapses surrounding the Boston bombing.</p>
<p>Holder, who says he has recused himself from an intelligence leak probe in which the Department of Justice subpoenaed phone records from Associated Press reporters, repeatedly dodged questions about the growing scandal.</p>
<p>When asked whether the DOJ attempted to work with the AP before seizing the phone records, Holder said, &#8220;I don’t know what happened. I was recused from the case.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Daily Mail expands in the article, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2324501/Attorney-General-Eric-Holder-defends-deputys-decision-secretly-obtain-journalists-phone-records-saying-searching-leak.html">Eric Holder points finger at his DEPUTY</a>, &#8220;Holder said that he recused himself from the making the controversial decision to subpoena the phone records of Associated Press journalists, saying that it was made by Deputy Attorney General James Cole.&#8221;For all those remaining Obama supporters, why isn’t Eric Holder indicted for obstruction of justice as a prelude to impeachment of his boss?</p>
<p>Already we are hearing that many more disclosures are about to break. One such disgrace, coming out of a broadcaster, notable for their ESPN coverage, is the account of the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/05/irs-official-in-charge-during-tea-party-targeting-now-runs-health-care-office/">IRS Official in Charge During Tea Party Targeting Now Runs Health Care Office</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sarah Hall Ingram served as commissioner of the office responsible for tax-exempt organizations between 2009 and 2012. But Ingram has since left that part of the IRS and is now the director of the IRS’ Affordable Care Act office, the IRS confirmed to ABC News today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The sport of network political coverage has been more about entertainment than accountability coverage. The application of investigative inquiry and objective criteria is mostly absent from the half-truths and feel good treatment of favored political causes and personalities. Quality investigatory reporting of a Robert Novak, Seymour Hersh or a Jack Anderson is very rare today. The standards that they practiced need to be applied by the Washington press corps.</p>
<p>Will the media demonstrate the same intensity of scrutiny, when querying Press Secretary Jay (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Ziegler">Ron Ziegler</a>, Jr) Carney as they did during Watergate? Dream on folks, the asymptomatic embellishment in reporting by the progressive media is embedded in their genes. Their function is to enable the collectivist cover-up that has a primal goal of dismantling our constitutional republic.</p>
<p>Independent news organizations need to get down to veracity and confront the power structure with the same vigor and intensity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peter_Zenger">John Peter Zenger</a>. The publishing trade honed by Benjamin Franklin is dishonored by the journalists that grovel for career recognition from media conglomerates that write deliberate falsehoods.</p>
<p>Journalists know that their editor can strip out any item that does not conform to the &#8220;PC&#8221; policy of the publisher. The real Associated Press scandal is that the moguls of media stories are in the business of serving the political agenda of their ownership masters.</p>
<p>The reason that alternative news sites are dangerous to the establishment version of information is that the internet readers obtain none filtered content and are able to assess their own conclusions. The rightful contempt due for government political propaganda also applies to the slick talking heads that mouth the scripts of their internationalist overlords. Whom do you trust? The globalist adaptation of reality has no credibility.</p>
