<p>After two mystical encounters with the evil spirit Zarathustra, the dark prophet Nietzsche announced the &#8220;<em>death of the Christian God.&#8221;</em> Dubbing himself the Antichrist, Nietzsche proclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The greatest recent event — that &#8216;God is dead,&#8217; that the belief in the Christian God has ceased to be believable — is even now beginning to cast its first shadows over Europe; however, few really understood &#8221; what has really happened here, &#8220;and what must collapse now that this belief has been undermined — all that was built upon it, leaned on it, grew into it; for example, our whole European morality</em>.&#8221; (False Dawn, Lee Penn, p. 433)</p>
<p>From the beginning of Christ’s earthly ministry, there were those who received Him but many more, like Nietzsche, who would not, and so it will be until the end.   The former are those who admit and humbly confess their sinful condition while the latter, being full of stubborn pride, covetousness, and envy will not.</p>
<p>Not even the mighty miracle of creation ex nihilo as described in John’s Gospel and Christ’s own bodily resurrection (Luke 16:31) can persuade those who choose not to believe.</p>
<p>This willful unbelief in Christ had been prophesied long before.  In support of this John cites Isaiah 53:1-3,</p>
<p>“<em>He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem</em>.”</p>
<p>In order to be received, one must be acceptable.  Christ is rejected by proud, rebellious, sinless men along with His offer of salvation because He is not acceptable to them.  Thus their final word to Him is the cross.</p>
<p>At the root of the rejection of Jesus Christ God incarnate is the rebellious assertion that man has not been created by Him.  He is a free spirit neither dependent upon Him for his life nor created in His spiritual image but rather a conscious product of evolution.  He is a man-god who can choose either to murder God or to invent sock-puppet deities to do his bidding, for he is the master of science, evolution, matter, energy, time, and being who through his own knowledge and powers will save himself, or so he foolishly believes.  In reality, an inner blinding prevents him from ‘<em>seeing</em>’ that his liberty does not lead to greater freedom but to slavery because willful rejection of his Creator means he becomes Satan’s infernal tool.</p>
<p>“<strong>I am become a monstrous machine of annihilation</strong>…”  Ritual of Destruction, the Satanic Bible, Anton LeVey</p>
<p>The ritual ‘murder’ of the Christian God led to the collapse of far more than just European morality.  Consider the following:</p>
<p>In Christian thought, a person is a spirit and personality is the total individuality of the spirit. Without spirit there is no person.  The term &#8216;person&#8217; originated in Christian theologies developmental struggle to comprehend the nature and experience of the Christian God, the transcendent, personal Triune God:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The derivative concept of human personhood is a gift of the Christian faith to culture</em>…” (Stephen P. Stratton, Chapter 14, p. 247, The Self, Paul Vitz &amp; Susan M. Felch, Editors)</p>
<p>Whether the Founders were individually Christian or not, there was among them a strong Christian consensus that finds some of its greatest spiritual and moral expression in the scholarly works of Samuel Rutherford in “Lex Rex” (1644) and in the writings of the 18th century jurist William Blackstone.</p>
<p>Rutherford reasoned that since all people are sinners, then no sinner&#8212;whether President, Att. General, Senator, ‘gay,’ pastor, cop, jurist, perverse sex-educator, abortionist, evolutionary biologist, or Supreme Court Justice for example&#8212;is superior to any other sinner. No sinner is above the law but rather subject to the law without exception.  All must recognize that they are sinners under the unchanging transcendent Law of God.</p>
<p>Blackstone greatly influenced early American understanding of the Christian God, the Bible, Law and nature. He taught that since the eternally unchanging Triune God is the omnipotent Creator who works and governs the affairs of men then all law should be consistent with His Revelation in the Bible. No law should be passed that is contrary to the higher law of God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as all men are created spiritual equals in the eyes of God, then life, property, worth, dignity and other unalienable rights are conferred upon each human person at conception.   For example, the unalienable right to life is because all people are God’s spiritual image bearers while freedom of religion and speech are the temporal property of a person’s God-given spiritual property of conscience and reason.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Property</em>,&#8221; published in The National Gazette on March 29, 1792, James Madison outlines the meaning of a person’s God-given spiritual property, some of its’ temporal rights and the meaning and intent of just government as opposed to unjust government:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>He has a property&#8230;.in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them.&#8221;  &#8220;He has a property&#8230;in his opinions and the free communication of them.&#8221;  &#8220;He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them.&#8221; &#8220;He has property very dear to him in the safety and liberty of his person.&#8221;</em>  (The Heritage Foundation)</p>
<p>Property is,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.<em>a man&#8217;s land, or merchandize, or money</em> (and) <em>as a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights. Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties or his possessions.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Just government is instituted to protect property of every sort:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>This being the end of government, that alone is a just government, which impartially secures to every man, whatever is his own</em>.&#8221; (Samuel Rutherford, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flexrex.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO1sCexTm3r93UBFOA6aF4uQ1WIA">lexrex.com</a>)</p>
<p>The Constitution therefore, recognizes the divine nature of man&#8217;s creation, that man is a person endowed by his personal Creator with spiritual property, a divine right to life and liberty, and the means of acquiring and possessing property. Hence our Republic recognizes Law is unchangeable because the Creator (John 1:1) is the unchanging Lawgiver Who is the same today as yesterday and for all eternity:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>It is sufficiently obvious, that persons and property are the two great subjects on which Governments are to act; and that the rights of persons, and the rights of property, are the objects, for the protection of which Government was instituted. These rights cannot well be separated</em>.&#8221; (James Madison, Speech at the Virginia Convention, December 2, 1829)</p>
<p>Vishal Mangalwadi, India&#8217;s foremost Christian scholar affirms that the Christian gift of personhood gave birth to the &#8220;<em>belief in the unique dignity of human beings,&#8221; </em>and this is,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>the force that created Western civilization, where citizens do not exist for the state but the state exists for the individuals. Even kings, presidents, prime ministers, and army generals cannot be allowed to trample upon an individual and his or her rights</em>.&#8221; (Truth and Transformation: A Manifesto for Ailing Nations, pp. 12-13)</p>
<p><strong> Death of the Christian God: Catastrophic Consequences</strong></p>
<p><strong>“</strong><em>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.”</em> John 3:19</p>
<p>Once the citadel of the Light that came into the world, modern Western Europe and America are roiling seas of darkness punctuated here and there by shrinking islands of light because evil-minded men love darkness rather than Light. Thus the perversely twisted, upside-down, lawless atmosphere of our age is the &#8220;<em>death of the Christian God&#8221; </em>made tangible.</p>
<p>When people fall away from the knowledge of God and transgress against His commandments, these actions effectively turn them back to their natural state. This means that in forsaking God, the fount of living waters, they have become cracked cisterns that hold no water. (Jer. 2:13) In other words, the death of the Christian God logically means the death of spirit (person), hence also spiritual and temporal property, and by extension the collapse of Western civilization and America’s Constitutional Republic&#8212; “<em>if the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?”</em>  Psalm 11:3<br />
The methodology of the ‘murder’ of Christ the Creator (John 1:1) requires that the miracle of six day creation (Genesis account) together with Adam and Eve and their fall be de-historicized and reduced to myth and fable (annihilated), a project already underway by the time of Descartes and fulfilled with infernal ‘higher criticism.’</p>
<p>In her book &#8220;<em>Total Truth</em>,&#8221; Nancy Pearcy, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, writes that one of the great ironies of history is that the enduring impact of Descartes philosophy has been precisely the opposite of what he had intended. Descartes had intended the defense of the human soul/spirit over and against the dehumanizing mechanistic and materialistic conception of the universe. Instead, soul/spirit was reduced to a shadowy substance totally irrelevant to the material realm known by natural science. The immortal soul/spirit became a kind of ghost only tenuously connected to the physical body.</p>
<p>After the success of Newtonian physics natural science began to take on the trappings of religion. Epistemologically, science began to be viewed as the way to true understanding, and by extension, true progress. Nature itself took on the guise of an impersonal, mystical entity described as a cosmic machine governed by deterministic energies working through natural laws as strictly as the gears of a clock. Though soul/ spirit are crucial for reason, conscience, morality, belief, faith, prayer, theorizing, science, math and religion, there was no room for them in the cosmic machine.</p>
<p>The mechanistic conception gave rise to evil ‘isms’&#8211;rationalism, positivism, skepticism, relativism, and scientific materialism (atheism), which granted the sovereign reason of sinful man and naturalistic science an epistemological monopoly on so-called &#8220;real&#8221; knowledge, facts and truth while trivializing everything else to faith, personal belief and social constructs.  The devilish consequences of this have been horrendous, for whereas the creation of universal moral law was traditionally the function of the Triune God, now this function is arrogated to the individual human will, making the &#8220;reason&#8221; of sinners into God and science into a dictatorship of the knowable.</p>
<p>“…<strong>men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil</strong>.” John 3:19</p>
<p>With &#8220;reason&#8221; sitting on the throne of the Christian God, heaven was shut-down and the physical world of the senses elevated to the supreme reality. The six day Genesis account was de-historicized and replaced with imaginative evolutionary cosmologies claiming vast ages of time.  As supernatural Christian theism declined, immutable truth, moral law and sin disappeared under the onslaught of evil “isms” and apostate Protestant Liberalism (pantheism) in tandem with reductionist evolutionary biology, which became the most prestigious way to study the depersonalized human organism. With knowledge limited to the sensory realm, Jesus Christ the Word Incarnate was “murdered,” meaning reduced by evil men to an immanent mystical evolutionary force (Christ consciousness) while man’s soul/spirit was lost in an endless cycle of reductionism and determinism. Man, the person created in the spiritual likeness of the One God in three Persons would be lost.  In his place would stand the subhuman hominid, a conscious product of evolution, the god of forces.</p>
<p>Today, the ‘god’ evolution has so thoroughly replaced the living Word (John 1:1) and Special Creation in the consciousness of vast numbers of scientifically endarkened men and women within and without the whole body of the Christian Church that one of the leading evolution-worshippers of our day, Professor S.J. Gould, describes scientism and evolution as the story of mankind that tells us,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>where we came from, how we got here, and perhaps where we are going. Quite simply, it is science’s version of Roots, except it is the story of us all</em>.”   (The Religious Nature of Evolution Theory and its Attack on Christianity, John G. Leslie and Charles K. Pallaghy, Ph.D, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>)</p>
<p>In glowing affirmation, Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) , a prominent evolutionary biologist and progressive creationist sees the ‘god’ evolution as a light that illuminates all facts, a trajectory which all lines of thought must follow, for if man,</p>
<p>“&#8230;<em>has arrived at his present state as a result of natural processes rather than a supernatural will, he can learn to control these processes…The concept of evolution, which is now basic to the life sciences, has provided new and in some ways revolutionary answers to questions men have been asking for centuries. The two most important of these are, ‘Why am I here, what is the purpose of human existence, and what is the nature of the world of life that surrounds us?”   </em>(Dobzhansky, T., Ayala, F.J., Stebbins, G.L. and Valentine, J.W., Evolution, W.H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, 1977)</p>
<p><strong>Triumph of Scientism and the ‘god’ Evolution</strong></p>
<p>At its founding and for about 150 years after America was the world’s beacon of freedom and hope because it was founded on the true Light of unchanging truths such as,</p>
<p>“<em>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8211;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. .</em> .”</p>
<p>Now however, an endarkened generation of law makers, politicians, entertainers, professors, seminarians and high school graduates no longer believe that anyone knows ‘the’ truth or even if whether males are meant to be males or females too. For them, anyone who claims to know the truth is a bigoted fundamentalist because they know there was never a fall from God’s good creation but rather an evolutionary ascent moving from primordial matter to creeping things, crawling things, knuckle-dragging things to man. They know with certainty that human beings were never created but evolved. And as the ‘god’ evolution endows nothing&#8212;not soul/spirit, personhood, unalienable rights and the freedom to exercise them&#8212;then our Constitution is as meaningless as Xmas and Special Creation.</p>
<p>The real source of this evil and madness is a godless left-right confederacy of nihilists described by Professor Angelo Codevilla as America’s Ruling Class.  In “<em>The Ruling Class: How They Corrupted America and What We Can Do About It,”  </em>Codevilla, emeritus professor of international relations at Boston University, argues that America’s real war is between Americans who still worship the supernatural Triune God and a class of evolutionary humanists who dominate both political parties, academe, Hollywood, science and media.  They preach from pulpits, run big business, our economy and the country&#8217;s major institutions and imagine themselves entitled to reshape an America that they regard as composed of un-evolved subhuman hominids.</p>
<p>The Ruling Class affirm that scientism and evolution trump the Revelation of God, and as they are the evolved products of the &#8216;god&#8217; evolution they are science’s authoritative enlightened priests and god-men who pray to themselves,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; <em>as saviors of the planet and as shapers of mankind in their own image</em>..&#8221; (The Ruling Class: How They Corrupted America and What We Can Do About It, p. xix)<br />
After more than eighty years of nearly unopposed evolutionary evangelization in the schools, media, seminaries, academia and elsewhere the Ruling Class is finally at liberty to declare that evolution is “mind,”</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>….enlarging its domain up the chain of species.&#8221;  </em>The god evolution is the <em>“universe&#8230;a mind that oversees, orchestrates, and gives order and structure to all things</em>.&#8221;   (Algeny, Jeremy Rifkin, 1983, p. 188)</p>
<p>Now that scientism and evolution reign supreme, Satan’s infernal machines, such as the demonized Rifkin,  no longer feel like guests,</p>
<p>”&#8230;..<em> in someone else&#8217;s home and therefore obliged to make our behavior conform with a set of pre-existing cosmic rules. It is our creation now. We make the rules. We establish the parameters of reality. We create the world, and because we do, we no longer feel beholden to outside forces. We no longer have to justify our behavior, for we are now the architects of the universe. We are responsible to nothing outside ourselves for we are the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever</em>.” (ibid)</p>
<p>According to Robert Muller, the father of World Core Curriculum, now that evolution is “mind” highly evolved men are free to spiritually evolve into higher and higher forms, to become one with the ‘divine:’</p>
<p>“<em>Once again, but this time on a universal scale, humankind is seeking no less than its reunion with the ‘divine,’ its transcendence into ever higher forms of life.  Hindus call our earth Brahma, or God, for they rightly see no difference between our earth and the divine.  This ancient simple truth is slowly dawning again upon humanity.  Its full flowering will be the real, great new story of humanity as we are about to enter our cosmic age&#8230;” </em>(New Genesis: Shaping a Global Spirituality, Robert Muller, father of Core Curriculum, 1984, p. 84)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..<strong>the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one.&#8221;  </strong>1 John 5:19<strong>    &#8220;Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.&#8221;</strong>  Luke 11:35</p>
<p>From the post-flood world of ancient Babylon to our own, the majority of the world&#8217;s people have lived under the tyranny of powers, principalities and various determinisms&#8212;karma, reincarnation, evolution, fates, furies, chance, cause, doom, natural selection, and genes. They believed that all events in the real world were predestined and controlled by unseen forces of the cosmos that the apostle Paul described as the elemental spirits of the universe.</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ God incarnate demonstrated His absolute control over the elements (Luke 8:24) the tyranny of determinism was cast down and utterly broken.  In the fourth century Gregory of Nazianzen suggested that at the very moment when the Magi came to worship the child of Mary and Joseph, it was then that the tyranny of determinism was broken:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;From that moment onward, the cosmos has orbited around the newborn king&#8230;Christ is the logos&#8212;the word and the reason by whom all exists and to whom all is ordered</em>.&#8221; (American Babylon, Neuhaus, p. 226)<br />
Determinism crept into the West when evil spirits entered into the heart of Christendom during the Renaissance.   They came quietly, first to certain theologians who rejected Jesus Christ in favor of Hermetic magic, Babylonian Kabala, Eastern mysticism, reincarnation, evolution, karma and other occult traditions and determinisms, and then openly with the brazen claim that laws of matter and evolution ultimately govern the world and man.</p>
<p>With penetrating insight, Father Richard John Neuhaus connects modern evolutionary scientism to its&#8217; ancient spiritual foundations in astrology. In his book, &#8220;<em>American Babylon</em>,&#8221; Neuhaus argues that astrological elemental spirits have been recast as,</p>
<p>&#8220;…<em>evolutionary dynamics, life forces, or laws of nature.&#8221;  Though described as laws rather than spirits, these elemental &#8220;forces”…. work their inexorable ways in cold indifference to reason, to will, to love, and to hope. In short, it is suggested that the elemental spirits are in charge and that human freedom is a delusion.</em>&#8220;(p. 226)</p>
<p>“<strong>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.”</strong>  Colossians 2:8</p>
<p>According to Pastor Larry DeBruyn, the word &#8220;<em>rudiments&#8221;</em> (Greek, stoicheion) relates to the universe of matter and energy and is variously,</p>
<p><em>“…. translated “elemental powers” (NAB), “elementary principles” (NASB), “basic principles” (NIV, NKJV), “evil powers” (NLT), and “elemental spirits” (ESV, NRSV). Translations indicate that stoicheion’s meaning diverges between “principles” and “powers,” between the “physical elements” constitutive of the cosmos or universe, or the “spiritual powers” that inhabit it. In 2 Peter 3:10, the first sense—that is, the “elements” which “shall melt with fervent heat”—is evident, while in Galatians 4:3 and 9, the other sense—that is, “world forces” which once “held in bondage” the Galatian believers—is evident.&#8221;</em> (The Supreme Supremacy of the Lord Jesus Christ,<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fguardinghisflock.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJMBqN8eF8dZg-IRvA0zfKH7BGHw">guardinghisflock.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The Worldview of Evil Spirits</strong></p>
<p>“….<em>we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”</em>  Eph. 6:12</p>
<p>During the 1970s Satanism and possession became front page news in America.  It was during this time that the eminent theologian Malachi Martin, a former Jesuit professor at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome published his shattering book on demon oppression and possession.<br />
Martin&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Hostage to the Devil</em>: <em>the Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans</em>,&#8221; presents five cases of actual possession that express important aspects of the worldview of evil spirits which allow us to not only identify these elements but discern their devastating effects within the whole body of the Christian church, the minds of millions of Americans and by extension, our nation.</p>
<p>The worldview of evil powers always takes the form of nature worship, or celebration of created things such as matter and energy as opposed to worship of the living, personal Creator Who created everything. Thus in support of the idea that living beings created themselves it is virulently anti-supernatural and Genesis account creation ex nihilo in favor of one dimensional naturalism and evolutionary cosmologies.</p>
<p>In one case, an evil spirit’s evolutionary cosmology teaching the self-created &#8220;universe of matter&#8221; and human life was disclosed wherein,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>men, women, animals, plants, cities, oceans </em>(are) <em>interconnected.  There is really no difference between one thing and anything else&#8230;.land, ocean, animals, humans, plants are one living organism clad in the shell of breathable atmosphere.  Psychic forces bind it all together&#8230;.It is a self-creating, self-protecting, self-developing thing&#8230;..Earth as mother, as womb, as god, as tomb, as a whole unity protected by its own shell and its own strength (is) all there is.&#8221; </em>(p. 395)</p>
<p>From the Big Bang (exploding cosmic egg) which supposedly created matter and energy in the demon&#8217;s description of the universe as &#8220;self-creating&#8221; to inflationary in the description of the universe as a &#8220;self-developing thing&#8221; to Gaia as &#8220;Earth as self-protecting mother&#8221; the possessing demon’s evolutionary cosmology is very similar to occult New Age spirituality.</p>
<p>Another important case involved David, a Catholic priest who became obsessed with the evolutionary scientism of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.  Teilhard’s destructive influence is widespread today within transnational Trans-humanist circles, the U.N., the Catholic Church, and increasingly within the Protestant Church.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Teilhard de Chardin: Trojan Horse of Vatican II/Heretic Extraordinaire</em>,&#8221; Dr. J. P. Hubert wonders whether based on Teilhard’s admission of a mystical encounter if his evolutionary science was satanically inspired.  Teilhard describes his strange encounter:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The man was walking in the desert&#8230;when the Thing swooped down on him.  Then, suddenly, a breath of scorching air passed across his forehead, broke through the barrier of his closed eyelids; an irresistible rapture took possession of him&#8230;.mightily refashioning the enfeebled fibres of his being.  And at the same time the anguish of some superhuman peril oppressed him, a confused feeling that the force which had swept down upon him was equivocal, turbid, the combined essence of all evil and goodness.  You called me: here I am grown weary of abstractions, of attenuations, of the wordiness of social life, you wanted to pit yourself against Reality entire and untamed.  I was waiting for you in order to be made holy.  And now I am established on you for life, or for death&#8230;.He who has once seen me can never forget me: he must either damn himself with me or save me with himself.  O you who are divine and mighty, what is your name? Speak</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hubert concludes that Teilhardism is,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;no doubt of Satanic origin&#8212;a true &#8220;religion of man,&#8221; if ever there was one</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>America’s Unfolding Spiritual Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>For over eighty-five years, America has been incrementally conquered by the same madness-inducing demon of hatred and violence that earlier took over Russia, China, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>This demon is mainly embodied within America&#8217;s &#8220;scientifically endarkened&#8221; Ruling Class which is deeply oppressed and possessed by elemental spirits and the delusion that the true enemy of America is always on the Right.  Having rejected the biblical God and the religious heritage of our civilization, they embrace instead an ancient order of beliefs of which Communism and Socialism are logical expressions.  A new world order is what they seek, but in order that it can emerge, the still remaining remnants of America&#8217;s Christian-based culture must be completely destroyed.<br />
What this means is that the spiritual catastrophe that unfolded in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany is unfolding on America’s stage.</p>
<p>Can this catastrophe be averted?</p>
<p><strong>Repentance: The Only Way Back</strong></p>
<p>Returning to David, prior to his obsession with Teilhardism he was destined to become a professor of anthropology at a Catholic university.  But under the influence of Teilhardism, he came to see that the Genesis account of creation ex nihilo, Adam and Eve as the first man and woman and parents of all mankind who fell and passed on Original Sin to all human beings were utterly contrary to modern scientific thinking and evolution.</p>
<p>Therefore David taught anthropology from a modern “evolutionary science&#8221; perspective, even going so far as to exclude traditional presentations of doctrines about creation ex nihilo and Original Sin.  But after introducing Teilhardism to his students, doubts arose when he observed the breathtaking transformative effects of this teaching upon Jonathan, one of his students, a priest who now insisted that <em>all the sacraments </em><em>are “…no more than expressions of man&#8217;s natural unity with the world around him.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>David’s eyes were suddenly opened and he saw clearly for the first time that Teilhardism exalted man as an animal and pictured,</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>God as no more than the very bowels of earth and sky and the spatial distances of the universe with all its expanding galaxies</em>.&#8221; (Martin, p. 107)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jonathan left the church and quickly founded his own cult among wealthy Manhattan families.  He preached that the universe and all people were evolving as ‘one’ in a naturally occurring mystical union which he called &#8220;<em>Abba Father</em>.&#8221; (p. 127)</p>
<p>Martin writes that Jonathan had come under the dominion of an evil spirit and David was called in to exorcise him.  However, the demon possessing Jonathan ridiculed David, saying they both believed the same things, therefore if Jonathan needed exorcism David needed it more.</p>
<p>Reeling in shock, David was led to an agony of soul-searching over the course of many weeks during which he re-examined and finally repented of the intellectual arrogance that led him to embrace Teilhardism and the &#8220;higher criticism&#8221; of Scriptures that reduced the Revealed Word to myth, allegory and delusion and the death of Jesus to an insignificant event of the evolutionary past rather than,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…an ever present source of personal forgiveness and unshakable hope for any future</em>.&#8221; (p. 149)</p>
<p>According to Martin, the evil spirit who had nearly succeeded in killing David’s faith now taunted him that to return to faith would entail slavery of mind and will.   But when a repentant David deliberately rejected the demon&#8217;s taunts,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;a great and breathtaking dimension full of relief&#8230;.flooded his mind and will and imagination&#8230;.And when he now looked at the world of nature around him&#8230;and heard the song of a mockingbird nearby, he received it no longer as he had while a Teilhardian evolutionist, as &#8216;intimations of molecules endlessly regrouping,&#8217; but rather &#8216;of endless life for each person, and of love without a shadow.</em>&#8221; (pp. 163, 165)</p>
<p>Speaking through Nietzsche, Zarathustra had declared the death of the Christian God on behalf of all willful unbelievers, but now for David, “<em>He’s alive and I’m forgiven</em>!”   His faith in God, Christ, the Holy Spirit and Scripture restored, David was ready to exorcise the evil spirit who possessed Jonathan.  He did so,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;in the name of God who created him</em> (Jonathan) <em>and you</em> (evil spirit), <em>and of Jesus of Nazareth who saved him!  You will depart and get back to the uncleanness and agony you chose.&#8221;</em> (p. 169)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomics">Abenomics</a> has been great for stock speculators and corporate bigwigs, but for everyone else, not so much. The fact is–despite all the media hype and monetary fireworks–Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s three-pronged strategy to end 20 years of deflation has been a total bust. But don’t take my word for it, check out this clip from Reuters and see for yourself:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the fourth quarter of last year, Japan’s economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.7 percent, revised figures show, slower than the initial estimate of 1.0 percent on weaker business investment and consumption….” (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/us-japan-economy-current-idUSBREA2901320140310">Japan fourth-quarter growth, external balance suffer blow in test for Abenomics</a>, Reuters)</p></blockquote>
<p>See? Japan’s economy is dead as a doornail. No sign of life at all. What more proof do you need than that?</p>
<p>And Abenomics won’t end deflation either. That’s another fiction. The weaker yen is just going to force working people and retirees on fixed income to reduce their consumption which will intensify the slump. Heck, even the IMF has figured that one out. Take a look at this clip from one of their recent pieces:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The average Japanese worker has been dipping into his savings to finance consumption growth. But there’s a limit to how far he can do this. The savings rate as a percent of disposable income has declined from around 5 percent a decade ago to close to zero today, leaving little further room for spending from savings….Looking forward, real wages are set to come under even greater pressure this year and next with higher underlying inflation and successive increases in the consumption-tax rate.” (<a href="http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2014/03/20/abenomics-time-for-a-push-from-higher-wages/">Abenomics—Time for a Push from Higher Wages</a>, IMF-direct)</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds to me like the IMF is telling old Shinzo that his plan sucks, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Whoever thought that dumping trillions of dollars into the financial system would end deflation had a couple screws loose. That’s not how it works. The Fed loaded up on $4 trillion in financial assets and inflation is still hovering at a measly 1 percent. So if the theory doesn’t work in the US, why would it work in Japan?</p>
<p>It won’t. The way to generate inflation is by circulating money in the economy and increasing the velocity. That means full employment and higher wages. That means fiscal stimulus and redistributive taxation. That means fixing the damn economy. But Abe’s not going to do that because it doesn’t jibe with his class war strategy which is what drives the current policy. Now check this out from Roger Arnold at The Street:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The essential policy tools of Abenomics are massive monetary and fiscal stimulus aimed at forcing the yen lower, which should cause exports to rise and domestic production to increase, leading to increased domestic job production and consumption: the virtuous cycle. In the process, Japan also increased sovereign debt, which must be serviced by the government. The servicing of that debt is supposed to come from an increase in tax receipts to be made available by the increased domestic production and consumption.</p>
<p>But it isn’t working.</p>
<p>The failure of Abenomics to stimulate economic activity and raise tax receipts enough to pay for the stimulus is now causing the government to double back on these programs with a counter-cyclical consumer tax increase of about 3%, which will be implemented in April. In other words, Abenomics is making the real economic and fiscal situations in Japan worse, not better. They are digging a bigger sovereign debt hole and accelerating the trajectory toward insolvency…Investors would be wise to avoid Japan altogether now, and probably permanently.” (<a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/12538531/1/arnold-abenomics-failure-is-the-global-canary.html">Arnold: Abenomics’ Failure Is the Global Canary</a>, The Street)</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s probably good advice, although I think Japan’s implosion will take much longer than Arnold seems to believe. But that’s beside the point. What matters is the that policy doesn’t work. The economy isn’t growing, personal consumption is weak, the trade deficit, the current account deficit and the national debt are all ballooning at the same time, and the Japanese people are growing more pessimistic. And on top of it all, a 3 percent sales tax is set to kick in at the beginning of April which is going to send the economy stumbling back into recession. (Abe pushed through the tax hike to placate his right-wing constituents even though the risks to the economy were obvious.)</p>
<p>So, it’s all bad, unless you’re high-flying stock trader or a money-grubbing corporate CEO, that is. Then things have never been better. Get a load of this in the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While Japan Inc. may be whistling a happy tune on the back of robust profit growth and a weaker yen thanks to the pro-business agenda of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a key survey released Wednesday shows that consumers aren’t in a similar Abenomics-induced state of rapture.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Office’s monthly Consumer Confidence Index contracted for the third straight month in February to 38.2. That’s the worst reading since Mr. Abe entered office in January 2013 and the lowest since September 2011. Respondents were even more pessimistic than during Mr. Abe’s year-long term as prime minister between September 2006 and September 2007…</p>
<p>Even though recent data showed the basic earnings of workers in the world’s third-largest economy rose for the first time in almost two years in January, respondents in the February survey were less optimistic about their income growth, the value of their assets, and their overall livelihood than they were a month earlier.</p>
<p>The downbeat reading prompted the government to downgrade its assessment, saying it is “on a weak note.” (<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/03/12/japanese-consumer-pessimism-hits-new-high-under-abe/">Japanese Consumer Pessimism Hits New High Under Abe</a>, WSJ)</p></blockquote>
<p>To say the Japanese are depressed, would be an understatement. Your average Joe is “even more pessimistic” than he was when Abe stepped down in 2007 and the economy was on the brink of rigor mortis. Does that sound like the “Happy Days are here again” blabber you’ve been reading in the media or hearing from liberal pundits like the madcap Dr. Krugman?</p>
<p>Also, according to a Cabinet Office survey that appeared in the Japan Times on Saturday, only 22 percent of respondents “think the economy is headed in the right direction”, while 76 percent are worried about the impact the consumption tax will have on the economy.</p>
<p>How’s that for a ringing endorsement of Abe’s Kamikazenomics? The only people who still believe in Abe’s song and dance are the ivory tower set at Princeton and Yale. Everyone else has thrown in the towel.</p>
<p>Abenomics is a public relations scam designed to shift more payola to voracious stock speculators and their thieving corporate counterparts. It’s a fraud wrapped in a lie. That’s all there is to it. But there are victims, that’s for dang-sure. Just check out this article in Bloomberg and you’ll see what I mean:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe looks set to drive an indicator of economic hardship to a 33-year high by increasing taxes and prices amid stagnant wages. The misery index, which adds the jobless rate to the level of inflation, will climb to 7 percentage points in the three months starting April 1 when Japan raises its sales levy to 8 percent from 5 percent, based on the median estimates of economists in Bloomberg News surveys of unemployment and consumer prices. That would be the highest level for the measure since June 1981 when Japan was emerging out of depression after the oil shocks in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan monetary stimulus designed to spur economic growth and achieve 2 percent inflation has weakened the yen by 6.8 percent in the past 12 months, eroding the value of wages to a record low. Abe, the son of an ex-foreign minister who grew up in a house with servants, is under fire from the opposition party after the cost of living surged to a five-year high.</p>
<p>“Inflation is really tough,” said Kiyoshi Ishigane, a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees more than $77 billion. “Those who speak favorably about inflation might have been born in wealthy families and never experienced the hardship that inflation brought.” (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-11/misery-index-rising-to-33-year-high-on-abenomics-japan-credit.html">Misery Index Rising to 33-Year High on Abenomics: Japan Credit</a>, Bloomberg)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Misery Index is peaking and all you hear in the US is a bunch of baloney about glorious Abenomics and the miraculous effect of money printing. What a joke. People are hurting big-time in Japan, and shifty Shinzo is only adding to their pain with his monetary Hara-kiri. It’s madness. Wages dropped for 19 months in a row before they got a “one-off” bump-up last month of 0.1 percent, which is a big nothingburger. The overall trend is down, down, down. On top of that, roughly 35 percent of Japan’s workforce is part-time employment; no pension, no bennies, no job security, no nothing. Things slow down, and you get booted down the stairwell with not as much as a “Goodbye, Charlie!” They probably don’t even bother with the perfunctory pink slip. Just grab your lunchbox, and “out you go.”</p>
<p>So how does Abe figure he’s going to generate inflation when workers are flat on their backs and don’t have enough scratch to buy the widgets that Japan Inc produces?</p>
<p>The whole thing is a non starter, which is why I think this “fighting deflation” trope is a big freaking smokescreen to hide what’s really going on, which is a massive transfer of wealth to the investor class via asset inflation. That’s what’s really happening, right? Abenomics is just a way to produce fat returns during extended periods of slow growth and deepening stagnation. The big boys figured out how to overcome the very conditions that they created with their unbounded avarice. I guess they figure that, just because everyone else has to suffer through a goddamn Depression, doesn’t mean they have to too.</p>
<p>You got to hand it to these guys, they think of everything.</p>

<p><strong>America&#8217;s &#8216;New&#8217; Reality of Non-Self and Madness&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of the insurrection against the living, personal God of Revelation that began during the Renaissance eventuating in the proclamation of the death of God and cataclysmic eruptions of fire, brimstone and rivers of blood during the 20th century, ex-atheist Alexander Solzhenitsyn said the world had never before known,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<i>godlessness as organized, militarized, and tenaciously malevolent as that practiced by Marxism. Within the philosophical system of Marx and Lenin, and at the heart of their psychology, hatred of God is the principal driving force, more fundamental than all their political and economic pretensions. Militant atheism is not merely incidental or marginal to Communist policy; it is not a side effect, but the central pivot</i>.” (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgoodreads.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGajW4zR_B6UXYkRBDyUoMCtJB2hg" target="_blank">goodreads.com</a>)</p>
<p>In his analysis of Marxist Communism and its’ alter ego, scientific materialism, Frank Meyers, an early conservative intellectual concluded that Communism is the state form,</p>
<p>“….<i>taken by a materialist faith determined to rule the world.”  </i>Godless Communism is the<i> “final synthesis of all heretical tendencies that have pervaded Western civilization for many centuries.”  </i>It is materialist scientism of which<i>, “Communism is the culminating hubris of the Promethean man who reaches out for the world and means to remake creation.  It is scientism gone political</i>.” (The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America, George H. Nash, pp. 251-252)</p>
<p>Both scientific evolutionary materialism and its new age evolutionary pantheist counterpart belong to the family of ‘new’ pagan or modern naturalism.  Modern naturalism refers to a one-dimensional view of reality grounded in a monist pagan philosophy holding that only void, matter and evolutionary (developmental and change-making) energies exist.  Therefore void, matter and energy are the Ultimate One Substance of which the universe consists and with which all life is in continuity, thus “all is one” and “everything is perpetually evolving and ascending.”</p>
<p>The main difference between these two views resides in whether matter is thought to be physical (i.e., Greek Atomism) or spiritual (Hinduism). However, both views share in common the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hatred of the supernatural God of Revelation and of man as His spiritual image-bearer</li>
<li>One dimensional views of reality</li>
<li>An inverted account of  origins and history lending itself to the notion that since there was no fall then Lucifer is not the devil and men are not sinful but rather evolving into gods</li>
<li>Scientific materialism or its’ New Age spiritual science counterpart</li>
<li>Evolutionary conceptions.  These serve two main functions. First, as a mechanical process of development and second, as a mechanism for purification of matter</li>
<li>The nihilism of Buddha<br />
Jesus Christ to Buddha,</li>
</ul>
<p>“…<i>you took God away (and) your espousal of an absence of self is the most unique and fearsome claim you made.”</i> (The Lotus and the Cross: Jesus Talks with Buddha, Ravi Zacharias, pp. 59, 67)</p>
<p>Life is <i>only with</i> the living God of Revelation, the creator and upholder of the life and being (soul/spirit) of men.  But if He does not exist, it logically follows that there is no ultimate source for life, conscious being, meaning and purpose; or for the sanctity of human life, worth, dignity, individual liberty and personal property.  Without God the Father Almighty unalienable (God given) human rights are as meaningless as America’s founding documents have become in our Godless pagan society.</p>
<p>If man is not God’s spiritual image-bearer then he is less than nothing, a conclusion Buddha reached long before Jesus Christ God Incarnate walked this earth:</p>
<p>“<i>Six centuries before Jesus Christ, the Buddha already knew that if God does not exist, then the human self cannot exist either…Therefore, he deconstructed the Hindu idea of the soul.  When one starts peeling the onion skin of one’s psyche, he discovers that there is no solid core at the center of one’s being</i>.”  Thus your sense of self becomes illusion, “<i>Reality is nonself…You don’t exist. Liberation, the Buddha taught, is realizing the unreality of your existence.”</i> (The Book that Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization, Vishal Mangalwadi, p. 6)</p>
<p><b>Naturalism: the Antithesis</b></p>
<p>Modern naturalism is in every way the antithesis of God’s Revelations and Christianity, the spiritual and moral foundation of Western civilization.   For fifteen hundred years, Christendom and then later Protestant America had affirmed the biblical view of total reality. In this historically unique view total reality consists of two interfacing, interactive halves: the seen (natural) and the unseen (supernatural).</p>
<p>According to this view, man faces both unseen and seen and interprets truth against these two interfacing halves of reality.  Thus Paul declares that as men live out their lives they are spectacles, “<i>unto the world, and to angels and men</i>.” (1 Cor. 4:9)</p>
<p>In opposition to modern naturalism’s one dimensional view, Paul affirms that total reality consists of two halves, hence this earth (the seen) is really a theater and men are actors on its stage observed not only by other men (the seen) but by the Spirit of God and angels (the unseen).</p>
<p>Though men cannot see the Spirit of God and very rarely see angels they can see, hear and interact with men.  The Spirit of God opens our eyes to understanding (Ps. 118: 34, 125, 144), tests our hearts, knows out secrets, motives, and thoughts (Psa. 17:3; 44:21; 139:1-4).</p>
<p>Both holy and unholy angels are all around us, watching, listening, helping and protecting if holy, if unholy then binding the disobedient to their power.   Just as the Lord of Hosts gives His Holy Spirit to those who love and obey Him, He can send evil spirits upon those who are rebellious, live in persistent sin, practice occult arts or men who in their pride, covetousness and envy reject and hate Him as was the case with Karl Marx and Nietzsche, the apostate Christian philosopher who proclaimed the death of God.  Unto these men the Lord of Hosts sent evil spirits just as He sent one to King Saul (1 Sam. 16:14).   The evil spirit influenced and disordered Saul’s thinking, afflicted him with obsessions and paranoia, befouled his conscience, and inflated his disordered passions thereby, “<i>filling him with unrest, anger, fear and murderous intent.”</i>  (Occult Bondage and Deliverance, Kurt E. Koch, p. 137)</p>
<p>Dr. Kurt Koch (1913-1987) was a highly respected German minister who pastored, counseled and delivered in excess of twenty thousand people suffering from demonic subjection. According to Koch, demonic subjection is an increasingly common occurrence in post-Christian Western and American society.  Most people have little or no clue that they are in fact demonically subjected while some people, such as Marx, Nietzsche, Hitler and Stalin seem to possess a limitless supply of demonic energy, especially when engaged in imposing their will over the wills of others.</p>
<p>There are many underlying causes of demonic subjection.  Koch delineates some of the leading ones common to apostatizing America:</p>
<p>“<i>If a person blatantly lives a life of sin and persistently resists the Spirit of God and remains completely unrepentant, or…carries the sin of murder or abortion on his conscience, or has committed perjury or practical incest, if he has cursed his fellow men or blasphemed against the cross or against Christ, the Holy Spirit, or God, then he will have laid himself open to the devil’s attacks.  Every curse is in fact a cry to the devil, and can…lead a person into bondage</i>.” (Koch, p. 138)</p>
<p>“….<b><i>God created man in his own image…..male and female created he them</i></b><i>.</i>” Gen. 1:27<br />
According to the uniquely Christian view of total reality, the essence of the human is not the body and brain (the seen) but the unseen…the soul/spirit:</p>
<p>“<i>It is the soul alone that God made in his own image and the soul that he loves…For the sake of the soul…the Son of God came into the world…”</i> (Incomplete Work on Matthew, Homily 25, Ancient Christian Devotional, Oden and Crosby, p. 153)</p>
<p>Building off of the view of man as embodied spirit, St. Augustine (AD 354-430) affirmed that as all men are the spiritual image bearers of the supernatural Triune God in three Persons, then it logically follows that each man is a person; a trinity of being comprised of soul/spirit (unseen), and body, brain (seen).</p>
<p>The citadel of the soul is spirit (heart).  Spirit is immortal and self-aware.  It can will and think and is responsible for what it wills, thinks, speaks, and acts on while in this world.</p>
<p>Spirit is the unique property that distinguishes soul from the material body in which it is fully embedded.  In Biblical thought, spirit allows man to spiritually transcend the natural dimension in order to access the third Heaven.  By way of prayer and petitions the spirit of man’s mind allows him to enter into a personal relationship with the Spirit of God.  Through this relationship, spirit is renewed over time, thus enabling man to more perfectly orient the manner of his thoughts, passions, words and actions in this world in preparation for eternity in Paradise.</p>
<p>In Christian thought, a person is a spirit (self) and personality is the total individuality of the spirit.  Without spirit there is no ‘self,’ hence no person.</p>
<p>The key to personal liberty in the natural or sensory half of reality is man’s spiritual liberty contrasted against a genetically pre-programmed animal-like orientation.  Animals have souls but not spirits, the basis of intelligence, sensitivity, imagination, self-consciousness, reflection back and forward into time, and the capacity for truth and moral goodness.</p>
<p>A person is uniquely free because he can spiritually transcend his material brain to access the Spirit of the Lord as Paul affirms:</p>
<p>“<i>Now the Lord is Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom</i>.” (2 Cor. 3:17)</p>
<p>Vishal Mangalwadi, India’s foremost Christian intellectual observes that this historically unique concept of man as God’s spiritual image-bearer gave birth to the <i>“belief in the unique dignity of human beings,</i>” and this is the force,</p>
<p>“…<i>that created Western civilization, where citizens do not exist for the state but the state exists for the individual.  Even kings, presidents, prime ministers, and army generals cannot be allowed to trample upon an individual and his or her rights</i>.” (Truth and Transformation: A Manifesto for Ailing Nations, Mangalwadi, pp. 12-13)<br />

<b>One-Dimensional Godless Naturalism: the Reality of Non-Self</b></p>
<p>Modern naturalism, whether of materialist or pantheist permutation positing a non-existent immanent conception of deity (i.e. Omega, Gaia) is at bottom Godless, and said Ravi Zacharias,  absolutely nothing,<b></b></p>
<p>&#8220;… <i>has a more direct bearing on the moral choices made by individuals or the purposes pursued by society than belief or disbelief in God</i>.&#8221; Key issues of the day &#8220;<i>whether it be&#8230;sexual orientation and practice, or life in the fetal stage, sooner or later filter down to whether there is a God, and if so, has he spoken?</i>&#8221; (The Real Face of Atheism, Zacharias, p. 21)</p>
<p>In &#8220;<i>The Gnostic Religion</i>,&#8221; Hans Jonas provides a full-scale study of the heretical world of pre-Christian and Christian era pagan Gnostic nihilism together with its modern variants:  materialist and pantheist naturalism.</p>
<p>Jonas writes that while ancient Gnostic pagan man was thrown,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<i>into an antagonistic, anti-divine, and therefore anti-human nature, modern man </i>(is thrown)<i> into an indifferent one</i>.&#8221; (p. 338)</p>
<p>The ancient gnostic conception was still anthropomorphic despite the nihilism, hostility and demonic.  But its’ modern counterpart with its&#8217; indifferent nature, its&#8217; completely godless, soulless, anti-human, demonic nature, represents the &#8220;<i>absolute vacuum, the really bottomless pit</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least the ancient Gnostic dualism, as fantastic as it was, was at least self-consistent, as there was the illusion of a source for &#8216;self&#8217; (being).   Not so for its&#8217; modern counterpart:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>So radically has anthropomorphism been banned from&#8230;.nature that even man must cease to be conceived anthropomorphically if he is just an accident of nature.  As the product of the indifferent, his being, too, must be indifferent.  Then the facing of his mortality would simply warrant the reaction, &#8216;Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.&#8221;</i> (ibid, p. 339)</p>
<p>In conclusion:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<i>modern nihilism</i> (is) <i>infinitely more radical and more desperate than gnostic nihilism ever could be for all its panic terror of the world and its defiant contempt of its laws.  That nature does not care, one way or the other, is the true abyss.  That only man cares, in his finitude facing nothing but death, alone with&#8230;.the objective meaninglessness of his projected meanings, is a truly unprecedented situation</i>.&#8221; (Jonas, p. 339)</p>
<p>In other words, the death of the living God of Revelation means there is neither source for life and ‘self’ (soul/spirit) nor for higher truth and morality, purpose, meaning, salvation and eternity.   For depersonalized man, the evolved ape or bag of chemicals, there is nothing&#8212;no heaven above, no hell below and no,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. <i>vast mind behind the framing of the world; no transcending voice giving counsel to this world&#8230;no light at the end of the tunnel </i>(hence only)<i> the loneliness of existence in its most desolate form.&#8221;  (</i>Zacharias, p. 27)</p>
<p>The determined assault against the living Holy God that began during the Renaissance gained speed and force with the materialist implications of Darwin’s neo-pagan theory.  The idea that humans evolved by chance and natural selection from non-life bearing chemicals lay the axe at the very foundation of the Genesis account of creation ex nihilo.  On the heels of Darwin’s theory Christianity came under forceful attack allowing a one-dimensional worldview draining into nihilism to be declared a scientifically supported reality.</p>
<p>Darwin&#8217;s <em>&#8220;Origin of Species</em>&#8221; was published in 1859 and instantly and uncritically accepted by people such as Karl Marx, T.H. Huxley, Herbert Spencer, Ernst Haeckel in Germany and large numbers of clergy more eager to be thought scientific and modern than to defend the faith once given.</p>
<p>For materialist and pantheist alike, Darwin&#8217;s theory was a wish come true and so became the center of their respective one-dimensional worldviews.</p>
<p>The demonized Karl Marx hated the God of Revelation and his exuberance for Darwin&#8217;s idea prompted him to consider dedicating his Das Kapital to Darwin, an honor which he declined.  Since Marx favored scientific materialism the rationale behind his invitation to Darwin was that he saw how Darwin’s materialist theory provided a scientific framework to support the economic infrastructure on which Marx could build his godless communist utopia.</p>
<p>Darwin&#8217;s materialist theory and Marxist materialist presuppositions (economic theory based on envy and hatred of God) together with Freud&#8217;s materialist-based analysis of religion and human sexuality threw faith in God and Christianity “<i>over the wall of civilization</i>,&#8217; said Zacharias:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>With such abusive attacks directed at religious belief coming from so many directions, it was left for someone to cast this creature called theism completely out, and exorcise the world of all such influence.  The one who did that was the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche</i>.&#8221; (p. 25)</p>
<p>By the time of Nietzsche, perceptive thinkers had already been expressing apprehension at the prospect of multitudes of unsuspecting Westerners who would eventually be cruelly exploited by anti-human haters of God.<br />
With Nietzsche, dreadful apprehension deepened into certainty, for Nietzsche despised religion in general, but upon Christianity he poured his unbridled fury:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;I call Christianity the one great curse, the one enormous and innermost perversion, the one great instinct of </i><br />
<i>revenge, for which no means are too venomous, too underhanded, too underground, and too petty</i>.&#8221; (Nietzsche in &#8220;The Life of Nietzsche,&#8221; Faru Forster Nietzsche, 1921, p. 656)</p>
<p>However, rather than mindless infatuation for Darwin’s idea, Nietzsche (1844–1900) harshly criticized it:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>What surprises me most when I survey the broad destinies of man is that I always see before me the opposite of that which Darwin and his school see or want to see today: selection in favor of the stronger, better-constituted, and the progress of the species. Precisely the opposite is palpable … I incline to the prejudice that the school of Darwin has been deluded everywhere…”</em> (Nietzsche: The evolutionist who was anti-God <em>and</em><i> </i>anti-Darwin, Russell Grigg, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ" target="_blank">creation.com</a>)</p>
<p>Nietzsche was not anti-evolution but rather had his own evolutionary conception which he called “the will to power.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Darwin received his idea from his pantheist grandfather Erasmus Darwin, Nietzsche&#8217;s conception was preceded by mystical ecstasy.  Nietzsche experienced two mystical encounters with the first one taking place in August, 1881.</p>
<p>Charles Andler writes that previous to his scientific reasoning, Nietzsche received revelations during mystical encounters just as Spinoza did.  Mystical ecstasy,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;. preceded </em><em>(Spinoza’s) system and his geometric form, thus, with Nietzsche mystical ecstasy preceded his scientific reasoning</em>.&#8221; (Charles Andler cited by Henri De Lubac, &#8220;The Drama of Atheist Humanism,&#8221; p. 481)</p>
<p>According to Henri De Lubac, secret knowledge was revealed to Nietzsche that he was <em>&#8220;&#8230;.the first of men to know.&#8217;   </em>The shock of it was sudden and profound.  Though no direct document relates his experience sure evidence is found in an agitated page of <em>Ecce Homo</em> where Nietzsche wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Suddenly, with sureness, with indescribable delicacy, a thing makes itself seen, makes itself heard.  It shakes you, it overwhelms you right to your innermost depths.  You hear it&#8230;You let it fill you&#8230;.A thought blazes forth like a flash of lightening&#8230;It imposes itself as a necessity&#8230;I never had to choose it.  It is an ecstasy&#8230;.You are enraptured, taken outside of yourself&#8230;All of this&#8230;is accompanied by a tumultuous feeling of liberty, of independence, of divinity&#8230;There you have my experience of the inspiration</em>.&#8221; (Lubac, p. 472)</p>
<p>In the months that followed he remained silent about the knowledge he received.  But in August of 1882 he discussed his experience with Lou Salome.  Salome writes that Nietzsche spoke of his encounter only in obscure words and with hushed voice.  Giving &#8220;<em>every indication of the most profound horror</em>&#8221; Nietzsche described the terrible and marvelous revelation he had received with two words: Eternal Return. (ibid, p. 473)</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1882 he experienced his second encounter which he described in the poem <em>Sils Maria:</em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I was sitting and waiting, without waiting for anything/Beyond good and evil, tasting Light sometimes and sometimes shade/Absorbed by this brew&#8230;When suddenly&#8230;what was one became two, And Zarathustra passed before me</em>&#8230;&#8221; (ibid, p. 475)</p>
<p>It was a vision without a doubt, precise and sudden:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I could tell you the day and the hour&#8230;.Zarathustra has fallen on me, he assaults me..&#8221;</em>  (ibid)</p>
<p>Zarathustra was an evil spirit who confirmed to Nietzsche the ‘truth’ of the revelations already received, which included man&#8217;s evolution from worms:</p>
<p>“<em>You [mankind] have made your way from worm to human, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now the human being is still more of an ape than any ape is.&#8221;</em> (Nietzsche,<em> Thus Spake Zarathustra</em>, Zarathustra’s Prologue section 3, trans. by G. Parkes, Oxford University Press, New York, 2005, p. 11)</p>
<p>Henceforth, Nietzsche is an inspired prophet who knows for certain that the God of Revelation is dead, that man’s evolution from worms is absolutely true, and that he is Jesus Christ&#8217;s successor, the ‘new’ Christ.  Within ten days he drafted by way of automatic writing the whole first book of his prophecy.  He called his finished work <em>Zarathustra,</em> the new Bible of scientific evolutionary naturalism, and told the world to throw away all other books, for now you have my <em>Zarathustra, &#8220;a new Holy Book.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>It was Nietzsche, the ‘new’ Christ, who saw that the death of the personal God had already begun to cast its first dark shadows over Europe, and though,</p>
<p><i>&#8220;the event itself is far too great, too remote, too much beyond most people&#8217;s power of apprehension, for one to suppose that so much as the report of it could have reached them,</i>&#8221; still its advent was certain, and it was men like Nietzsche, the ‘new’ Christ who were <i>&#8220;the firstlings and premature children of the coming century</i>,&#8221; the century of the &#8220;<i>triumph of Nihilism</i>.&#8221; (Nihilism: The Root of the Revolution of the Modern Age, Eugene Rose, p. 44)</p>
<p>Nietzsche was the first apostate Christian to gaze fully upon man&#8217;s loss of faith and its terrifying consequences.  With no living God ‘up there’ to obstruct his vision, the nihilism he saw was agonizing.  As there was no longer any Light from God above, there was only darkness in the hermetically sealed world below.  The paralyzing darkness that overtook the mind of the ‘new’ Christ was spiritual.  It was not so much,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.<i>an exterior phenomenon crowding inward but rather an inner blinding that spread outward</i>.&#8221; (Ravi Zacharias, p. 27)</p>
<p>This was precisely Nietzsche&#8217;s point.  With the death of the personal God of Revelation the darkness of objective meaninglessness <wbr></wbr>would penetrate every avenue of thought and life, making life itself unbearable with the consequence of hedonism, abortion, euthanasia, sodomy, suicide, drugs, crime and murder becoming virtues.</p>
<p>Speaking through the writings of the ‘new’ Christ, Zarathustra went on to say that because God had died in the 19th century there would follow two terrible consequences beginning in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. (Romans 1:18)</p>
<p>First, the 20th century would become one of the most evil century’s in history, and second, a universal madness (Romans 1:21, 22) would break out and turn the once glorious W. Europe and America upside-down.</p>
<p>Though apostates and the apostatizing professed themselves wise, their cognitive thought processes would become darkened (vain) and with their conscience dead to sin they would become fools, meaning they would accept and publicly profess incredibly stupid conceptions of themselves (i.e., man is an evolved worm, ape or robot; man is evolving into god).</p>
<p>“<i>And I will give children to be their princes, and the effeminate shall rule over them</i>.” Isaiah 3:4</p>
<p>In turning away from the Spirit of God and the truth He has given, ‘wise’ males will become effeminate cowards and females mannish.  They will be adolescent emotional-tyrants in adult-size bodies: sinister, greedy, spiteful, vindictive, treacherous, back-stabbing sophists.  They will celebrate Lucifer (the devil) and in their madness actively seek the way of Luciferian initiation because they will be spiritually blind in regard to total reality.  Like demons they will flee from the cross of Jesus but exalt the devil as the first free thinker, the genetic creator of man, the seething energy and angel of evolution.  Truth will be lies, evil will be good, unfaithfulness will be faith and the ‘wise’ will preach and blaspheme from pulpits, exercise political power, enact legislation, and wield broken law to plunder, punish, and ruin.</p>
<p>Zarathustra has been right on both counts.  First, apostatizing W. Europe and America, though dotted here and there by small islands of Light, decency and sanity, are becoming darkened, satanically inverted places ruled by the ‘wise,’ hence boiling over with madness, particularly Hollywood, academia, mainstream media and the highest, most powerful political offices in the land.   Second, Nietzsche was made to show the ‘wise’ what is in store for them by spending the last eleven years of his life insane.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/the-rapture-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/the-rapture-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>In this column last week, I stated the salient reasons why pastors will not take a public stand on issues regarded as controversial or political. I believe every point I made are the real reasons pastors refuse to stand for much of anything&#8211;or even objectively study anything outside their comfort zone. To read this column, go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18813" target="_blank">Why Pastors Won’t Take A Stand</a></p>
<p>To review, most pastors refuse to take a stand because:</p>
<p>1. They are success oriented and have an innate aversion to anything that is considered to be controversial. And, to them, there is nothing more controversial than politics.</p>
<p>2. They are afraid that if they take a controversial stand, they will lose members&#8211;and more importantly, tithes and offerings. Most churches are neck-deep in debt and are heavy-laden with staff and overhead. The thought of losing even a few giving families is enough intimidation to make sure that they do nothing to offend the people of the congregation. And since the pastor never addresses controversial issues or preaches “hard” sermons, his congregation is filled with people who harbor myriads of big-government, socialist ideas and would immediately bolt at any mention of Biblical Natural Law principles that ran counter to their leftist ideologies.</p>
<p>3. They have an erroneous interpretation of Romans 13 that civil government must be submitted to regardless of how evil or immoral its laws might be. This fallacious interpretation of Romans 13 (which is taught in practically every Christian school and college in America) has made them de facto slaves and worshippers of the state. As did Germany’s pastors and Christians in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, America’s pastors and Christians suffer from national “exceptionalism.” This fallacy leads them to believe that by serving the state, they are serving God. In their minds, one cannot be “right with God” if they are not totally submissive to the state.</p>
<p>4. The 501c3 non-profit corporation status of the Internal Revenue Code under which the vast majority of churches throughout America operate has intimidated pastors and church leaders to the point that they will do&#8211;or not do&#8211;almost anything to stay in the good graces of the IRS. To most pastors, this means staying absolutely as far away from political issues as possible&#8211;even if those issues were moral and spiritual in nature a long time before they were considered political.</p>
<p>5. Most pastors are ignorant of the Biblical Natural Law principles of liberty. In the same way that many attorneys are completely ignorant of constitutional government, pastors are completely ignorant of Biblical Natural Law principles. Attorneys are not taught constitutional principles in law school, and pastors are not taught Biblical Natural Law principles in Bible school.</p>
<p>But there is one more reason why many pastors will not take a stand that I did not address in the aforementioned column: their belief in a pre-tribulation rapture.</p>
<p>The word “rapture” does not appear in the Bible. The English word “rapture” is taken from the Latin word “rapere” and means to “catch away.” Theologically, it means that Christians will be caught away or taken to Heaven while they are still alive. There are several scriptural passages that Christians believe relate to this event, but the most cited is I Thessalonians 4:16, 17: “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up (Greek word “harpazo”) together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”</p>
<p>Of course, Christians throughout the centuries have taught and believed a variety of nuances of eschatology. The various interpretations of The Second Coming of Christ are almost limitless. There are pre-tribulational, pre-millennialists; mid-tribulational, pre-millennialists; post-tribulational, pre-millennialists; partial-rapture, pre-tribulational, pre-millennialists; post-millennialists; pre-wrath, (almost) post-millennialists; amillennialists, etc. And to each of these interpretations there is a plethora of sub-divisions and schisms.</p>
<p>Christians have historically believed that they will be resurrected to be with Christ. However, that conviction&#8211;historically and by itself&#8211;did not prevent Christians from being engaged in whatever the political, social, or cultural battles of the time might have been. From the earliest days of Christianity, believers were politically and socially engaged in their communities and countries. During the Roman Empire, a baby was not protected by law until the father granted it official human status. Until then, babies could be legally killed or allowed to die. Christians by the thousands would go out into the streets at night and rescue babies that had been “thrown away” and left to die. During the Dark Ages, when the Bible was banned, Christians continued to widely copy and distribute the scriptures. Reformers such as Ulrich Zwingli died defending Switzerland’s Protestant Reformation on the battlefield. Colonial Christians (including pastors) in great numbers participated in America’s War for Independence. The great German theologian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, joined a Nazi resistance movement. Each of these Christian believers held their individual, respective views of the Lord’s coming and personal resurrection, but this did not keep them from being politically, socially, and culturally&#8211;and sometimes militarily&#8211;involved in their communities and countries.</p>
<p>However, with the broad acceptance of what has become known as Dispensationalism, many pastors and churches in America have almost totally removed themselves from political affairs. Except for voting (which is mostly kept private), pastors avoid politics like the plague. A few will talk in very broad and general terms about America “turning back to God,” etc., but what that means specifically is seldom addressed. And if pressed for an explanation, most pastors will piously say, “God has not called me to get involved in politics.” I’m not sure that God has called them to play golf either, but that doesn’t prevent a host of them from engaging regularly in that worldly activity.</p>
<p>Dispensationalism, as it is called today, was popularized by John Darby, C. I. Scofield, and Lewis Sperry Chafer. In more modern times, John Walvoord, J. Dwight Pentecost, Charles Ryrie, Tim LaHaye, and Hal Lindsey contributed immensely to Dispensationalism’s theological acceptance. The key element of Dispensationalism, as it relates to eschatology, is the doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture of Christians. The idea is that the world is going to continue to get worse and worse until finally the Anti-Christ will arise as a global leader and will usher in seven years of “Great Tribulation,” wherein a sizeable portion of the world’s population will be destroyed. But before “The Great Tribulation” begins, Christian believers will be raptured into Heaven. Dispensationalists further believe that following the seven year Tribulation period, Christ will physically return to Jerusalem and establish a 1,000 year reign (called The Millennium) in which the Davidic Kingdom will be restored to Israel.</p>
<p>Now, let me state plainly that it is not my intention at this point to disparage the sincerity of faith and belief of the vast numbers of pastors and Christians who subscribe to Dispensationalism. Whether the pre-tribulation rapture is a correct Biblical interpretation or not is NOT the focus of this discussion. I find a sizeable number of pastors and Christians who subscribe to post-millennialism and other forms of eschatology to be just as disengaged from speaking out and engaging the political process as pre-tribulationists.</p>
<p>That being said, I believe it is an absolute fact that many pastors and Christians are using the doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture to justify sitting back and doing nothing to actively resist evil and wickedness. In their minds, there is no need to be politically involved because everything is going to get worse anyway&#8211;but they are going to be raptured to Heaven before it all falls apart. I have actually had pastors say to me, “Chuck, by resisting evil government, you are fighting against God, because it is God’s will that government gets worse and worse so that Jesus can come back.”</p>
<p>The wretchedness of this kind of thinking should be obvious to any rational person. In the first place, how arrogant are these American Christians to think that they are so special that God would have to rapture them before any real tribulation began? Think of the millions of Christians in oppressed nations throughout history&#8211;and even today&#8211;who have already been, and continue to be, IN GREAT TRIBULATION. The tribulation of Christian martyrs throughout church history is legendary. Have they never read Foxe’s Book of Martyrs? Do they not know what has taken place in southern Sudan over the last 20 years? Have they not read the history of Christians in Mao’s China, Amin’s Uganda, Pol Pot’s Cambodia, Hitler’s Germany, Stalin’s Russia, etc. Who do they think they are? Why should Christians in America be spared what Christians throughout the world have endured and are enduring? Even if their interpretation of a pre-tribulation rapture is correct, that doesn’t mean for one moment that Christians in America would not be called on to suffer great tribulation at the hands of a wicked and oppressive government&#8211;especially considering that the vast majority of pastors are doing almost nothing to resist our government from becoming wicked and oppressive. For the doctrine of a pre-tribulation rapture to be used as some kind of sit-back-and-do-nothing-<wbr></wbr>because-a-divine-Seventh-<wbr></wbr>Cavalry-is-coming-to-rescue-us attitude is the height of absurdity. Dare I say it borders on blasphemy?</p>
<p>Secondly, people who use the pre-tribulation rapture doctrine as an excuse to justify being disconnected from political involvement by saying things like, “Jesus is coming soon, so it doesn’t matter!” are demonstrating either acute cowardice or immeasurable ignorance.”</p>
<p>Christians throughout the millennia have looked for the return of Jesus. The doctrine of the Second Coming of Christ has been held sacred by Christians of every generation for over two thousand years. That Jesus is coming soon doesn’t stop us from going to school and getting an education; it doesn’t stop us from going to work every day to earn a living; it doesn’t stop us from planning our financial futures or saving for retirement; it doesn’t stop us from teaching and training our children; it doesn’t stop us from learning and exercising personal skills; it doesn’t stop us from locking our doors or buying expensive alarm systems to protect us from the bad guys; and it doesn’t stop these disconnected pastors from spending years trying to perfect their golf game. Neither should it stop us from preserving the liberties and freedoms of our nation.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the Old Testament king of Judah, Hezekiah. He was told by the prophet that God was going to judge his country with great oppression, but that it would not happen until after he expired, some 15 years later. Hearing that, Hezekiah said (paraphrase), “Oh goodie! At least it won’t happen while I’m alive.”</p>
<p>I ask you, what kind of father and grandfather would rather see his own children and grandchildren endure persecution and oppression than him do something in his lifetime to prevent it? What kind of uncaring, hard-hearted, pleasure-mad sorry-excuses-for-manhood are we that we would not want to sacrifice our own comfort, our own possessions, our own lives, in order to provide something better for our children and grandchildren?</p>
<p>These stand-for-nothing pastors do NOT know when Jesus is coming. And they do not know what kind of tribulation their children and grandchildren are going to endure at the hands of future tyrants and despots because they refused to do something that could have prevented it.</p>
<p>Our Christian forebears believed in the return of Christ and in personal resurrection. Whether they were pre-millennial, post-millennial, pre-tribulational, mid-tribulational, post-tribulational, etc., they didn’t allow their personal interpretation of Bible prophecy keep them from doing what was the right thing to do when it was in their power to do it. They were statesmen, leaders, and even warriors. They worked; they dug; they studied; they taught; they led; and they fought. And when needed, they risked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.</p>
<p>Are we really more spiritual than were they? Are we really more studied? More intelligent? More dedicated? More sincere? More courageous? Or more Christ-like?</p>
<p>How dare this generation of spoiled, lazy, comfort-laden, cowardly, sheepish, success-motivated, passive pulpits sit in judgment on the Christian men and women of history who, regardless of their personal interpretation of eschatology, actively engaged in the social, cultural, and, yes, political affairs of their countries&#8211;and helped bequeath to us, their posterity, a free and independent land? How dare they use the doctrine of the rapture as an excuse to justify their own indifference? And more importantly, how dare Christians tolerate such cowardice and carnality?</p>
<p>Thirdly, Dispensationalists allow their interpretation of Bible prophecy relating to future Israel to obfuscate the divine principles of liberty as it relates to present America. Preachers such as John Hagee have twisted the scriptures to support almost unlimited wars of aggression against Middle Eastern countries in the name of befriending Israel. In reality, unconstitutional war, nation-building, foreign interventionism, etc., is no friend to Israel, the United States, or any other country.</p>
<p>America’s foreign policy is a global nightmare. It has made enemies where none existed. It has made it increasingly difficult for American missionaries to give the Gospel to people in foreign countries. In many countries, it has inflamed the persecution of Christians. It has greatly contributed to the economic bankruptcy of the United States. It has turned the affections of the world against us. It has turned many American Christians from peacemakers to warmongers. Under the rubric of the “war on terror,” America is being turned into a giant police state. In truth, the Warfare State that has been created in this country is not a blessing to Israel (or any other country), but a curse. But the Dispensationalists’ interpretation of prophecy tends to blind them to these maladies.</p>
<p>Yes, many pastors and Christians have a rapture problem. But the problem is not really the doctrine itself but the way it is misapplied. I know pastors of all theological and eschatological backgrounds who are actively engaged in the freedom fight; and I know pastors of all theological and eschatological backgrounds who are disengaged from the freedom fight. It’s up to the man. If men want to, they can hide behind anything. And when pastors choose to hide behind the rapture, it becomes a problem for all of us.</p>

			<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.” </i>  Proverbs 16:18</p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fallofmankind3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fallofmankind2.jpg" align="left" /></a><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In “<i>Against the Heathen</i>,” early Church Father Athanasius reveals that pride and haughtiness preceded man’s fall into idolatry and paganism.  A haughty spirit led them to make light of higher things, and deliberately disregarding what they knew to be true they began to seek in preference things in the lower or natural dimension.  Thus they fell into worship of self, sexual pleasures and acquisition of status and things to the living God and higher things.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The truth as to evil said Athanasius,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> <i>“….is that it originates, and resides, in the perverted choice of the darkened soul</i>” which, “<i>materialized by forgetting God”</i> and engrossed in lower things<i>, “makes them into gods</i>,” and thereby  <i>“descends into a hopeless depth of delusion and superstition,</i>” whereby <i>”they ceased to think that anything existed beyond what is seen, or that anything was good save things temporal and bodily; so turning away and forgetting that she was in the image of the good God, she no longer… sees God the Word after whose likeness she is made; but having departed from herself, imagines and feigns what is not (and then) advancing further in evil, they came to celebrate as gods the elements and the principles of which bodies are composed</i>….” (Against the Heathen, New Advent)  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Having descended into delusion and superstition they imagined they had no free will and further that “all that exists” is the natural dimension&#8212; a divine One Substance, watery abyss, chaos, or void, primordial matter, animated natural powers, forces, and deterministic laws, all of which they celebrated and attributed miraculous powers to.   So for example, with the Egyptians’ self-created Sun-God Ra, the divine abyss or One Substance out of which he evolved is Nu&#8211;primordial matter:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“I came into being from primordial matter…I made all the forms under which I appeared by means of</i> (or out of<i>) the god-soul which I raised up out of Nu</i> (i.e., the primeval abyss of water.) (The Long War Against God, Dr. Henry Morris, p. 243)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This is naturalism, or materialism, which is the belief that there is neither living God nor heavenly realm.  There is only the natural dimension, thus evolutionary materialist Dr. Scott Todd wrote in the science journal ‘Nature:’</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“<i>Even if all the data point to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic.”</i>  (Naturalism in the Light of Reality, Robert Gurney, creation.com, June 14, 2012) </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Materialism is of the worldview of monism which is held in common by pantheism and spiritualism and dates back to pagan antiquity and was or is taught by all non-biblical thought systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Greek Stoics and Epicureans, for example, were materialistic monists and these two schools of natural science and evolution held the ancient world of thought in allegiance well into the Roman Empire.  Epicureanism reigns supreme in our own age through modern evolutionary materialism, which is merely revamped and revised Epicureanism.   </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The pagan philosopher Epicurus (342-270 B.C.) believed in an infinite number of worlds, or parallel universes in the words of contemporary ‘new’ pagan materialists.  Like his modern counterparts, Epicurus taught that there was no god or gods, first principles, moral law, souls and afterlife as all things on earth had evolved from the earth material.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Epicurus preferred lower things to higher things, as do his contemporary followers, thus he taught that “all that exists” is an eternally existing void and animated matter.  This made human beings, their intelligence and volition, an evolved accident of chance.    Reason is left, but reason is active only because sensations (i.e., firing of neurons, chemical interactions) stimulate it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In modern “scientific” terms, the idea that brute matter spontaneously generated itself from nothing (void) in much the same way as Ra spontaneously generated himself from Nu is called abiogenesis.  On the basis of this ancient mythological superstition, new-pagan evolutionary materialists assert that the living supernatural God, souls, spirits, angels, demons, heaven, hell and metaphysics do not exist.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">As for ‘modern’ evolutionary theory, anthropologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, longtime director of the American Museum of Natural History reveals that Darwin is not its’ originator but rather ancient pagans are.  In the introduction to his history of evolutionism Osborn wrote:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“<i>When I began the search for anticipations of the evolutionary theory….I was led back to the Greek natural philosophers and I was astonished to find how many of the pronounced and basic features of the Darwinian theory were anticipated even as far back as the seventh century B.C</i>.” (Osborn, From the Greeks to Darwin, p. xi)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Abiogenesis is such an obvious embarrassment that today some naturalists such as SETI researcher Paul Davies and Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the DNA molecule, have abandoned it in favor of panspermia.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Panspermia is the idea that life on earth was accidentally seeded by meteorites containing the essential building blocks of life or perhaps by highly evolved extraterrestrials who for billions of years have been guiding the evolution of man.   The extraterrestrial idea was favored by Arthur C. Clarke in his book, “<i>Childhood’s End</i>” and a variation on this theme has recently been advanced by Davies, Crick, and Ralph Pudritz of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Davies has written seriously about the possibility of “<i>alien bioengineering</i>” that could be detected in the DNA of life on earth and suggests that citizen scientists and school students be enlisted to help search for evidence. (An Alien Code Close to Home: Seeking ET Beyond the Radio Silence, Astrobiology Magazine, Jeremy Hsu, 10/27/2011)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Pudritz theorizes that humans and aliens may share the same DNA which itself could be part of a universal structure “<i>of the first genetic codes anywhere</i>….” (Why Aliens Might Look Like You, Eddie Wren, dailymail.co.uk/ June 11, 2012)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Crick proposes a theory called “directed panspermia,” the idea that,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“…<i>life on earth may have begun when aliens from another planet sent a rocket ship containing spores to seed the earth</i>.”   </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">He admits however that his theory only pushes the unresolvable problem of the origin of life out into deep space:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“<i>This scenario still leaves open the question of who designed the designer [aliens] — how did life originally originate</i>?”   (Crick, Life Itself: Its Origin and Nature, 1981)</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Myth of Extraterrestrials</span></span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In his book, “<i>Scientific Mythologies</i>,” James A. Herrick traces the ‘aliens from outer-space’ idea back to certain Renaissance astrologers, occultists, and mystics such as Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) who claimed to not only receive telepathic secrets from spirits but to have visited populated planets during out-of-body experiences. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Swedenborg’s influence is far-reaching.  From Kant to the occult theosophist Madame Blavatsky and points in between and on into our own time to psychologist J.B. Rhine, a vast array of science fiction writers (i.e., Clarke, H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, Steven Spielberg) and numerous evolutionary scientists.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Over time, Swedenborg’s astral plane ‘space travels’ gave birth to what Herrick dubs “<i>The Myth of the Extraterrestrial.</i>”  As far back as the seventeenth century science fiction writers were imagining “<i>the intelligent extraterrestrial visitor</i>” and preparing the public to accept their existence.   And accept them they have, for the twentieth century has witnessed a veritable population explosion in the alien domain, said Herrick.  (p. 43)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In general, science fiction, like new-pagan evolutionary materialism, is neither particularly scientific nor futuristic.  It is rather a regression to the mystical pagan origins of modern science that reappeared in the heart of Christendom during the Renaissance.   In “<i>The Abolition of Man</i>” (1974) C.S. Lewis points out that the Renaissance reawakened a magical view of the world closely connected with pagan Gnostic sectarianism, Hermetic magic, astrology, Eastern pantheism and alchemical scientism .   Accompanying all of this was evolution, occultism, Epicureanism, reincarnation and karma.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Evolution is both the antithesis of creation ex nihilo and the primary doctrine of both Eastern pantheism and Western scientific materialism, and so early on Lewis understood that both movements were merely two sides of the same pagan revival.  Thus he argued that pantheism and materialism are not enemies in principle but rather cooperating philosophies united against the supernatural Creator, His Revelation, creation ex nihilo, all higher things, the linear view of history and Christian-based civilization.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">What this means is that naturalism, abiogenesis, chance, natural selection, multiple universe and panspermia theories are but six contemporary adaptations of ancient pagan “idolatry, magic, occult mysticism and mythology.”   These six are of a whole host of fallacies derived from modern evolutionary thinking that have permeated the post-Christian West and American society giving birth to a “new” pagan religion of evolutionary science.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Fall of Western Civilization</span></span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Christendom and Protestant America arose on the wings of the Genesis account of creation ex nihilo, the Biblical view of man’s sinful condition and God’s Moral Law.   Their subsequent fall was traced b</span>y Richard Weaver in his book, “<i>Ideas Have Consequences</i>,” (1945).   In many ways Weaver’s analysis parallels Athanasius’ account of the fall of man.  </p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Weaver writes that 14<sup>th</sup> century Western man had made an <i>&#8220;evil decision</i>” to abandon his belief in the transcendent God and universals and thus the position that &#8220;<i>there is a source of truth higher than, and independent of, man&#8230;&#8221; </i> The consequences of the rejection of “higher things” were catastrophic:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&#8220;<i>The denial of everything transcending experience means inevitably&#8230;the denial of truth. With the denial of objective truth there is no escape from the relativism of &#8216;man is the measure of all things.&#8221;</i> (The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America, George H. Nash, pp. 32-33)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><b>“Now the soul of mankind, not satisfied with the devising of evil, began by degrees to venture upon what is worse still.”</b>   Athanasius</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Fueled by a corrupted motive of dominating and bull-dozing the real world so as to coerce other wills, Western apostates conceptually murdered the living God, sealed off the supernatural dimension and elevated Nature to the supreme reality.  The doctrine of original sin was abandoned and replaced by the “goodness of man.”  With only the material realm of the senses held to be real, supernatural Christianity declined, the omniscient mind of human-gods arose, and pagan materialistic science became the most prestigious way to study man.  With knowledge limited to the sensory realm, man’s spiritual attributes&#8212;-soul, mind, conscience and volition&#8212;were soon lost in an endless cycle of reductionism and determinism.  Man, created in the spiritual likeness of his supernatural Creator was lost.  In his place stood the soulless human ape, an accidental emergent product of evolution and “earth material.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> <b>Fall of Western Man</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From the Renaissance to our own time, a stunning spiritual transformation of consciousness has shifted Western and American thinking away from the supernatural God and biblical religion and toward the lower thing, the new pagan religion of evolution.    In his book, “<i>The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Tradition</i>,” James Herrick calls it the “<i>New Religious Synthesis</i>” and briefly outlines seven of its components:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">1. History (as well as unchanging truth and moral absolutes) has no spiritual significance.  This is because the idea of continuous evolutionary change makes them absurd.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">2. The supremacy of omniscient reason, mystical mind-powers, intuition, and collective consciousness.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">3. The spiritualization of science. Since the empirical study of the material universe employs reason to acquire knowledge, and reason is not physical but rather spiritual, today it is acknowledged that reason is in fact acquiring spiritual knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">4. Animated nature (animism).   The natural dimension is alive with energies, divine spirit, Zoe, god-soul, and consciousness. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">5. Gnosis, or esoteric knowledge, the provenance of spiritual elites and extraordinarily gifted individuals, including some scientists.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">6. Spiritual evolution.  Through control and direction of their own spiritual evolution certain naturally selected humans are destined to realize unimaginable spiritual advances. Spiritual or conscious evolution leap frogs off of Darwin’s’ biological theory and will supposedly lead to actual human divinity.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">7. Religious syncretism rooted in common mystical experiences and telepathic revelations from disembodied intelligences. (Herrick, pp. 33-35)</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“But in his estate shall (Antichrist) honour the God of forces.” Dan. 11:38</span></span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Under the New Religious Synthesis, the animated <i>god-force called evolution</i> is the principle miracle-producing power of the cosmos. Whether by way of abiogenesis or by accidental or directed panspermia, human beings are evolution’s conscious products and can now achieve ever-higher levels of consciousness by directing their own evolution.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In the book, “<i>The Aquarian Conspiracy</i>,” Marilyn Ferguson pointed out that the efficient direction of evolution requires “<i>a mechanism for biological change more powerful than chance mutation</i>” which will open “<i>the possibility of rapid evolution in our time</i>.” (p. 148)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Some evolutionists now claim that this powerful mechanism is presently available to man from aliens who will solve mankind’s problems and conduct man to a new “cosmic” age. Aliens are busily transforming the consciousness of abductees and other Westerners and through them teaching evolution, naturalism  and occult New Age philosophy as well as warning of a coming planetary apocalypse and denying the living God, the supernatural dimension and Christian theism. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">All of this has led French physicist and UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee to conclude that something is happening to human consciousness that is causing a major shift in man’s belief systems and his relationship to the concept of the invisible.  Vallee believes that the same “<i>powerful force’</i> that influenced the human race in the past is influencing it again:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“…..human belief…is being controlled and conditioned, man’s concepts are being rearranged, and we may be headed toward a massive change of human attitudes toward paranormal abilities and extraterrestrial life.”  (</i>Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future, Fr. Seraphim Rose, p. 109)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In light of this, Vallee proposes the hypothesis that there is a control system,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“… for human consciousness…I am suggesting that what takes place through close encounters with UFOs is control of human beliefs, control of the relationship between our consciousness and physical reality, and that this control has been in force throughout history….”</i> (Alien Intrusion: UFOs and the Evolution Connection, Gary Bates, p. 158)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Frank Baumer concurs and observes that evolution has,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“….<i>persuaded people to think of everything in nature as the fruit of a gradual growth rather than an original creation.”</i>   The sweeping acceptance of evolutionary thinking means that it is “<i>now difficult if not impossible for an educated man to conceive of a primitive revelation such as traditional Christianity taught, or even of an original natural religion from which men had declined</i>.” This difficulty arises because “<i>in an evolving world, perfection obviously lay, not in the past, but in the future.”</i>(Religion and Rise of Skepticism, p. 147)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">In occult terminology, transformation of consciousness is egregore, a concept representing a “thought form” (i.e., Richard Dawkins’ memes) or “collective group mind,” resulting from a psychic entity influencing the thoughts of a group of people.   However, egregore derives from the Greek word for “watchers,” leading the French occult magician Eliphas Levi (1810-1875) to identify egregore with the fallen angel ‘fathers’ of the nephilim.   In Christian language, transformation of consciousness means “demonic outpouring.’ Vallee’s “powerful force” is a new demonic outpouring being loosed upon mankind.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">So complete has the transformation been that the <i>God of forces</i> has successfully inverted the order of creation and reversed the direction of Biblical theism.  With creation ex nihilo virtually replaced by evolution, it is now believed that men have not fallen from perfection but instead are gradually evolving upward from their ape beginnings toward greater and greater spiritual perfection.  Self-perfecting man no longer needs the living, supernatural God as the idea of “conscious evolution” means he can save himself, and perhaps even attain god-hood.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><b>“The gradual abasement of the Soul from Truth to Falsehood (is) by the abuse of her freedom of Choice</b>.”     Athanasius</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Two brilliant visionaries foresaw the stunning events we are witnessing today—the wholesale rejection of Truth tied to the fall of Westerners into idolatry and paganism influenced and directed by a demonic outpouring effecting a transformation of consciousness in tandem with the rise of the New Religious Synthesis.  Each man in his own way predicted these events would usher in the end of the world and the appearance of the Antichrist. The two visionaries, Vladimir Soloviev (1850-1900), a brilliant Russian philosopher and theologian, and Robert Hugh Benson (1871-1914), an English Catholic priest, recorded their predictions in gripping novels&#8212;Soloviev in the “<i>A Short Tale of the Antichrist</i>” and Benson in “<i>Lord of the World</i>.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Benson saw through the scientific pretenses of new-pagan materialism and its’ primary doctrine, evolutionary theory, leading him to describe it and its’ ideological movement Communism as “<i>quiet pantheism</i>.” </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Benson predicted that evolutionary thinking would prepare Westerners and Americans not only to embrace the ‘new’ pagan religion but to worship and adore Antichrist, for this human-god (Mr. Felsenburgh) is the first perfected product of nature and evolutionary forces. Mr. Felsenburgh has arisen in America and he is,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“….the first perfect product of that new cosmopolitan creation to which the world has labored throughout its history</i>…” (p 85)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">He transfixes men, and they excitedly declare they have seen, </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“…<i>the Son of Man,’ the ‘Savior of the world,’ we knew Him in our hearts as soon as we saw Him, as soon as He stood there. It was like a glory around his head</i> (and now we) <i>understand it all… It was He for whom we have waited so long; and He has come, bringing Peace and Goodwill in His hands.”</i> (pp. 85, 89)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Christianity failed, it divided people. But now Jehovah is gone.  He never existed at all except as a hideous nightmare. Now at long last man’s natural Savior has arisen:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">”<i>The reign of God has really begun</i> (and<i>) we are all partakers of God</i>” because God is in everything, including all men….”<i>Jehovah has fallen. He is in His grave.”</i>  In His place is the evolved Son of Man, a god indeed and a man as well…”<i>a god because human and a man because so divine</i>.” (ibid, pp. 93, 95)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Soloviev’s predictions regarding events in our age are astonishing in their prescience, primarily because they not only offer an amazingly accurate glimpse into the mind of the super-man who will become the Antichrist but they also illustrate the real obstacle to salvation, the refusal by proud, willful men to recognize and admit to their sinful condition. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Prior to his transformation, Soloviev describes the proud super- man as outwardly just, but within he is full of pride and is morally reprehensible:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“…. <i>He believes in God but loves nobody but himself. His relationship with Christ was quickly defined as one of superiority</i> (for he will never) <i>bow before Him like the most stupid of Christians</i> (nor<i>) mutter senselessly….’Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me’….’I, the bright genius, the superman! No, never</i>!” (The Wrath of God: The Days of Antichrist, Livio Fanzaga, pp. 39-40)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">As the super-mans’ spiritual fall progresses, instead of the former cold rational respect for the living God and Christ:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“…..<i>there was born and grew in his heart, first, a kind of terror, and then a burning, choking and corroding envy and furious breath-taking hatred</i>.”  Devoured with envy of Jesus Christ he cries out “<i>He rotted in the tomb, rotted like the lowest</i>…” (ibid, pp. 40-41)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">This is the moment the Evil One has been waiting for.  He openly approaches the proud super-man and possesses him:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">“<i>He saw those piercing eyes and heard&#8230;a strange voice, toneless…stifled, and yet clear, metallic and absolutely soulless as though coming from a phonograph.” Satan pours out his spirit, saying, “I ask nothing of you, and I will help you for your own sake…Receive my spirit…it gives birth to you in power. At these words…the superman’s lips opened of themselves, two piercing eyes came quite close to his face, and he felt a sharp, frozen stream enter into him and fill his whole being. And at the same time he was conscious of a wonderful strength, energy, lightness and rapture</i>.” (p. 43)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Soloviev masterfully portrays a striking contrast between the apostles of Christ and the Antichrist. The former receive the power of the living God and are full of wisdom, truth, and courage while the latter receives the power of the devil and is full of nihilistic pride, lies, burning envy, murderous hate, blasphemy, cursing, resentment, deception, covetousness, and perversion.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The Antichrist, as described by Soloviev, suffers the same massively inflated pride and envy that transformed Lucifer into the devil. This same pride and envy animated the pantheist sorcerer Hegel, the neo-pagan Masonic Illuminati who planned and instigated the bloody French Revolution, as well as Karl Marx, Nietzsche, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, the West’s “God is dead” theologians, America’s Ruling Class, and many contemporary New World Order globalists. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  <b>The “New” Pagan Religion of Darkened Souls</b></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><i>“….human history can now be hesitantly traced back as an unbroken narrative to 4000 B.C.  The facts must not, however, be twisted to suit the fallacy of necessary human progress.  For the picture emerging….is one of the Fall of Man in historic terms as well as his rise; it is a picture …more of degradation than of success; it is a picture of monotheism breaking down into polytheism and of the struggle to return to monotheism.  The establishment view of the history of religion gradually progressing from animism to polytheism, from polytheism to monotheism is the reverse of facts</i>.”  (The God-Kings and the Titans: The New World Ascendancy in Ancient Times, James Baily, 1973, p. 296)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Evolution is a religion, said Michael Ruse. From the beginning it was a religion and this is true of evolution today.  (Michael Ruse, former professor of philosophy and zoology at the University of Guelph, Canada, “How evolution became a religion: creationists correct?” National Post, pp. B1, B3, B7, May 13, 2000)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.  From the beginning this was true, and in these last days it is still true.  Pride, haughtiness and envy are the common bonds linking Satan, the Antichrist, idolatry, paganism, the Religion of Evolution and all who have been and are being spiritually transformed by it.   Thus when the Antichrist arrives, perhaps as a highly evolved extraterrestrial or as the Transcended Master Maitreya, all darkened souls will perversely celebrate him as the highly evolved god and man they foolishly believe they too will become.</span></span></span></p>

				<p>February 26, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=16972#respond" title="Comment on Limbaugh’s New Racism"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="16972 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=16972">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rush-Limbaugh3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rush-Limbaugh2.jpg" align="left" /></a>For some years, several times a week while driving to go shopping and do errands, I have listened to Rush Limbaugh on the radio.  Pretty much all the time I have become angered because every few sentences I realized that with his total sincerity and conviction he was stating absolutely incorrect things.  Add to endless wrong information complete lapses in logic, causing me to be bewildered that Limbaugh has reached such success.  My only explanation is that he appeals to a very large number of ignorant and unintelligent people who, like religious zealots, remain enraptured by his ultra-ring wing rhetoric.  What a surprise therefore that recently Limbaugh has been speaking relentlessly about “information poor” Americans as his pseudo brilliant explanation of why President Obama has succeeded.</p>
<p>Two things stand out.  First, he clearly refuses to face the reality that it is his incredibly loyal audience that must be information poor to readily accept all the falsehoods he dishes out daily.</p>
<p>Here are just two simple example of intentional misinformation and disinformation he has dispensed, like the proverbial Kool-Aid keeping his listeners doped up.  He recently was admonishing President Obama for doing terrible things or not doing the right things and in his routinely glib, smooth style spoke of the five years of the Obama presidency.  This happened at about 10 percent into Obama’s second term, in other words some weeks, or about 90 percent less than the full fifth year of the Obama presidency.  How could an honest, fair person so easily state to his vast audience that there had already been five years of Obama as president?  And yet, there it was.  I quickly realized that this specific event was just part of the normal design of the ludicrous Limbaugh rhetoric, actually propaganda designed to maintain the conservative idiocy of his loyal audience.</p>
<p>And then today I heard Limbaugh refer to the settlement of Minnesota by the Vikings.  As usual I shook my head in disbelief.  I could not imagine how the Vikings had managed to get so far inland when they had hit North Americaaround the year 1000.  So when I got home I did some easy research on the web and, of course, verified that I was correct to disbelieve what Limbaugh had said.  The Vikings discovered Eastern Canada, not what is now defined asMinnesota.  But like everything else Limbaugh mutters he conveys a complete sense of honesty, correctness and conviction, despite being totally wrong.  Does Limbaugh connect the Minnesota Vikings to historical fact?  Perhaps he has learned from many years of astounding radio success that he can say just about anything and get away with it.</p>
<p>Now for my major point about information poor people that he now talks about endlessly.  Limbaugh has shown semantic creativity in expressing racist thinking.  When he uses the presence of many millions of information poor Americans to explain Obama and Democratic successes he has devised yet another way to attack African Americans and Hispanic Americans that, indeed, are demographic realities causing failure for Romney and other Republicans.  Moreover, it is also apparent that Limbaugh does not appeal to the poorest Americans who he routinely condemns for living off of government handouts.</p>
<p>I suspect that if there were good data about the demographics of the Limbaugh audience they would reveal, like those voting for Romney, that it consists mostly of older, higher income white American men.  Well, turns out there is some decent information.</p>
<p>As to the listeners of Limbaugh&#8217;s daily radio show, according to a <a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1102/limbaugh-audience-conservative-men" target="_blank">2008 news media consumption survey</a> conducted by PewResearch, 72 percent are male and 80 percent are conservative.  About three-quarters of his listeners identify themselves as Tea Partiers and Christian Conservatives.  In other words, Limbaugh does not change the thinking of people, he appeals to a mindset and gives those people exactly what they like.   Another <a href="http://www.sgalbert.com/2010/03/rush-limbaugh-audience-demographics.html" target="_blank">source</a> says his audience is 95 percent white and two-thirds earn more than $60k a year with the majority earning over $100k a year.  In other words, not only is his audience mostly white men, they are also in the upper parts of the economic spectrum (I suspect mostly small business types who may have learned how to make money but nevertheless are quite ignorant and prejudiced.)</p>
<p>As to his website, <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/rushlimbaugh.com#%21demo" target="_blank">according to quantcast.com</a> (as of March 3, 2012) the vast majority of visitors to RushLimbaugh.com are aging white males: 54 percent are 45 and older, with 28 percent 55 and older, and 91 percent are Caucasian.</p>
<p>So here is a radio god whose success depends on having information poor people as addicted listeners using the same concept to condemn those minority Americans he aggressively blames for the ruin of the nation because they vote for Democrats.  And of course with his male dominated audience he has shown himself to be rude and worse towards women, another demographic that Republicans have lost.</p>
<p>It is time for people, especially decent Republicans, to condemn wacko Limbaugh for all of his many failures, especially his new attempt to mask racism with the cloak of information deficits.  If Republicans ever want to appeal to a broad cross section of Americans they should have the courage to disown and openly condemn the appalling strategy of bloviator Limbaugh to cater to the most stupid and biased Americans.  They may, indeed, be seen as the core constituency of the Republican Party, but they are a heavy anchor pulling it down.  Interestingly, among Republicans, only <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2010/09/12/section-1-watching-reading-and-listening-to-the-news/" target="_blank">13 percent say</a> they tune in to Limbaugh “regularly.”  Time to dump Limbaugh.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/CopCrop3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/CopCrop2.jpg" align="left" /></a><span>Libertarianism has become popular.  But is it really the answer to the despotic regimes that have characterized the history of human society?  Some who claim the name are close but many are far into utopian fantasies.</span></p>
<p><span>I like Lou Rockwell.  His internet page is always a source of truth and commendable prose. I saved a quote where he said that the “moral law applies across the board, and that one is not exempted from it by a government suit.”  That is a good starting point as long as the source of the moral law is the Word of the Christian Triune God.  Unfortunately, God’s Law is rarely, if ever, mentioned in Libertarian circles.</span><span>   </span></p>
<p><span>Most Libertarians are pedagogic, articulate, intellectual, and industrious; they have no peers in chronicling the swift deterioration of our nation.  Their primary moral code is that coercion is evil and freedom is righteous.  Most envision a society f<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VHWSrdSFq2I" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ree from restraints</span></a> where everyone considers the rights of their fellows. Their objective is attractive and though its realization is murky and imprecise their ranks are growing.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span>Libertarianism</span></span></a><span> has roots in the Godless intellectualism of the Enlightenment.  Seventeenth Century French intellectual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rene Descartes</span></a> declared   “I think, therefore I am”. Deification of the human mind began the tragic and irrational march toward human divinity.  Thomas Paine called it “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Age of Reason</span></a>” and with the irreverence of a rebel and the brilliance of an intellectual he discarded the formal religion of the ages in favor of his own deistic opinions.</span></p>
<p><span>Intellectualism spawned the Enlightenment and like its progenitor Libertarianism is steeped in intellectualism.  Free trade ala <a href="http://mises.org/liberal/ch3sec7.asp" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ludwig von Mises</span></a> takes on an almost divine character.  The fractured condition of the movement provides insight into the results of the deification of the human mind.</span></p>
<p><span>Libertarian ranks include Liberals, Conservatives, Paleo-Conservatives, Anarchists, Minarchists, limited government rebels, mislead Christians, freedom loving intellectuals, and rebellious youth.  There are Socialist Libertarians and Capitalist Libertarians.  European definitions tend to be anarchic and politically left while American definitions are broader supporting free market capitalism.  All tend to resist coercion and emphasize freedom, liberty, and voluntary association.  There are moral Libertarians and immoral Libertarians.  There are Koch Libertarians and Rockwell Libertarians.  As with many Godless intellectual movements there is a wide acceptance of free sex.</span></p>
<p><span>Former Congressman Ron Paul has done as much as anyone to popularize the Libertarian Movement. His run for the Presidency was filled with wisdom and honesty that would serve us well but his defeat was programmed before he began his campaign.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Peter Theil</span></a>, an openly gay member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/investor_peter_thiel_is_the_billionaire_behind_ron_paul_s_presidential_campaign_.single.html#pagebreak_anchor_2" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">provided major support</span></a>.  I voted for Ron Paul and thought his financing was a result of large quantities of small contributions from internet sources.  I now wonder if it was a setup to insure the election of Barak Obama.</span></p>
<p><span>Libertarianism lacks an anchor and is plagued with the anarchy of human opinion.  When organizations become fractured by opposing opinions they become weak through diversity.  Power results from a clear objective.  There are too many voices in the movement. In a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-libertarianism-fails-2012-12" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Business Insider article</span></a> Eric Zuesse writes that Libertarians “entirely avoid the real question, which is: What type of government is good? As an “ideology,” libertarianism doesn’t even make it to first base: it’s fake, from the get-go. That’s why libertarianism fails.”</span></p>
<p><span>Allegiance to God’s overarching legal system provides an anchor and a big step forward for freedom. Opinions are a form of coercion with each proponent striving to dominate.  Anthony Wile at the Daily Bell recently posted a fascinating interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gilder" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">George Guilder</span></a>.  Guilder is a consummate insider who lost his father to WWII and was parented by David Rockefeller.  Some of Guilder’s opinions are compatible with patriots, new world order opponents, and some Libertarians.  <a href="http://thedailybell.com/28485/Anthony-Wile-George-Gilder-on-His-New-Book-the-Superiority-of-Ludwig-Von-Mises-and-the-Necessity-for-a-Regulatory-Jubilee" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The interview is here</span></a>.   It is an interesting interview of a very smart man.  However, I am not as much interested in the interview itself as I am with the demeanor of Gilder’s responses. He responds with the assurance of the wealthy elite and Wile accepts his responses with the demeanor of the proletariat.  Though they are just opinions Gilder expects them to be heeded; there is tyranny in his manner.  An interview with Walter Block provides another example of dominate opinion.  Block has the lofty credentials of an academic. He expects respect for his positions but with less dominance.  <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/block/block213.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Read his interview here</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Rejection of the Christian doctrine of original sin undergirds scores of disastrous social and political ventures. The government of the United States of America was founded and has been conducted under the assumption that government is a human domain.  We live in a Democratic Republic which depends on the voting public to elect individuals who will abide by a Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span>God provided Commandments, not opinions.  Commandments are authoritative and dominating, they demand compliance.  Opinions vary from man to man and are subject to rejections.  Commandments vest authority in God while opinions vest authority in the creature.  One is God centered, the other is humanistic.  God’s Commandments are simple and immutable; human law is voluminous, complex, emendable, and often obtuse.</span></p>
<p><span>The United States Constitution is a man made document that is being shredded by men and women who have taken a sacred oath to uphold it.  These are evil, dishonest people.  This kind of behavior is typical of the majority of kings, queens, and dictators that have enslaved and abused the earth’s population from antediluvian times.  It would create severe problems in an anarchic Libertarian society.</span></p>
<p><span>Absolute freedom is like infinity, it is beyond the kin of mankind.  We are captives in a body and captives in a universe.  We had nothing to do with our birth and baring suicide we have little to do with our death. Our inclination is to fall into a captivity of action that imprisons our lives.  Some of us become obsessed with business, some with learning, some with drugs, some with sex, some with ego, etc.  A mature person in a properly governed society should be free to choose where he will use his life.</span></p>
<p><span>Al Benson began one of his recent columns with this paragraph: “We see in operation today two kingdoms in the world—the Kingdom of God and the kingdom of man (the state). There are few legitimate governments anymore that really comprise the “state.” Most of the legitimate ones are gone, having been replaced with dictatorships, oligarchies, or fake “republics” that fool people with charades they refer to as elections and whose results have already been predetermined long before the “election” takes place. We recently had one of those in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span>The human freedom being pursued by the Libertarian agenda is at war with the Kingdom of God and in spite of its popularity it cannot realize its objective. Freedom is rooted in Christianity.  It is rooted in individual responsibility and obedience to God’s Commandments.  God’s government is the opposite of the new world order; His government is decentralized. The family is the basic unit.  The state acts as protector and the church is God’s agent.</span></p>
<p><span>The universal application of Law is the key to freedom.  All of society; the individual, the church, and the state, must abide by God’s Law.  Government cannot be allowed to pass laws to which they, themselves, are not subject; it always ends in tyranny.</span></p>
<p><span>Christians have been living in a dream world and the next few months and years may bring a big change in their religious perception.  God’s Judgment has fallen on our world!   R. J. Rushdoony wrote that “the Moloch state is a product of apostasy.”  We are in the grip of a product of apostasy that is abolishing our freedom and conducting a war against God and His people.  Hobby Lobby is resisting the new health care law which demands support for abortion.  The Moloch state will require a massive daily fine for non-compliance.  The state does not worship the Christian God of Hobby Lobby; its god is the anti-Christ.</span></p>
<p><span>Hundreds of thousands of Dispensational Christians are expecting world government to bring the Rapture and the Second Coming of Christ.  It could happen but it is likely it will not.  If they are wrong they will be shocked to find themselves living in a police state run by an evil cabal that hates their Savior.  The dictionary defines apostasy as abandonment of a previous loyalty.  We have abandoned the orthodox Reformed Christian Faith that was bequeathed by our fathers and followed a heresy that has allowed the humanistic hand of evil to invade our religion, our lives, our homes, and our nation.</span></p>
<p><span>As the horrors of the new world order afflict the Western World people will realize that government is not the source redemption.  They will concede that we have not followed the gift of salvation with obedience and dominion; and that if we <a href="http://www.covenantnews.com/cronkrite091116.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">expect to live in freedom</span></a> again we must turn from our sin and repent of our wicked ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Christians often quote 2 Chronicles 7:14 where God promises to remove His judgment “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”.   I get many emails quoting this Bible passage but none of them specify what is meant by turning from our wicked ways.   God’s judgment is not confined to abortion or to homosexuality or to disobeying the often questionable personal guidance that comes from God “speaking to” individuals.  Judgment comes for disobedience to His Commandments (His Law).</span></p>
<p><span>We have lost our nation to Moloch because we have allowed a foreign religion to change our laws legalizing the evils of abortion, homosexuality, murder, dishonesty, theft, injustice, war, genocide, hate, pugnacity, greed, torture and independence.   When a society allows its government to disobey God’s Law that society is on the road to ruin.</span></p>
<p><span>Freedom is not realized by abandoning government and allowing moral evil to run rampant, it is not a product of a lack of laws, nor can it be produced by intellectual endeavor.  Freedom is a result of obedience to the Commandments of our Creator.  Libertarians put the rational product of their minds above the Law of God.  They are not the only ones who believe their opinions are superior to God’s. Our society is full of legal standards, folkways, and mores that are at odds with God.  We are living in a cesspool created by our own vain laxity and many have not yet smelled the stench.</span></p>

<p>On October 5<sup>th</sup>, Southern Baptist preacher <a href="http://babyloniansquirrel.blogspot.com/2010/10/chris-rosebrough-and-james-white.html" target="_blank">Rick Warren</a> sat down with <a href="http://www.emailbrigade.com/266.html" target="_blank">New Age/New Thought</a> high priestess Oprah Winfrey for an <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/70818930/Rick%20and%20Oprah.mp3" target="_blank">interview</a>.  Although Oprah claims to be a Christian she most assuredly is not as I clearly demonstrate <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/120507" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/070303" target="_blank">here</a>.  <a href="http://www.dennyburk.com/joel-osteen%E2%80%99s-christianity-without-a-cross/" target="_blank">Joel Osteen</a>, who is said to be “one of America’s most influential spiritual leaders,” appeared on the show prior to Warren to promote his new book, “<a href="http://apprising.org/2012/09/19/i-declare-word-faith-preachers-are-agents-of-satan/" target="_blank">I Declare: 31 Promises To Speak Over Your Life</a>.”  Around 45,000 people attend Lakewood Church each Sunday to hear Osteen preach the word-faith prosperity gospel “lite.” It’s really not surprising that he was invited to appear on “Oprah’s Life Class.”  The duo has become fast friends ever since she and Tyler Perry attended a Lakewood service some months back.  They soon discovered how like-minded they are.  In fact, Osteen has this Oprahesque declaration on his <a href="http://ww2.joelosteen.com/LandingPages/Pages/iDeclare/iDeclare.aspx" target="_blank">website</a>:</p>
<p><em>The words we speak set the course for our life. If you want to know what you’re going to be like in five years, listen to the words you are saying about yourself today.</em></p>
<p>Egads!</p>
<p>Osteen not only teaches a false gospel, he apparently has scant knowledge of the scriptures which is the main reason the man who pastors the largest megachurch in America is unaware that the Lord has called His followers to “rightly divide the word of truth” (2 Tm 2:15).</p>
<p>Rick Warren’s claim to fame is his books “The Purpose Driven Church” and “The Purpose Driven Life.” PDL is the best-selling hardback non-fiction book in American history and is translated into more than 50 languages.  By using modern marketing methods he helped lay the foundation for the Church Growth movement (CGM).  Largely due to the popularity of his purpose-driven books the CGM has spread through churches like a windstorm sweeping across the Great Plains, ushering in a “new paradigm” of <a href="http://www.deceptioninthechurch.com/orrel13.htm" target="_blank">transformational leadership</a> to meet the challenge of the new century.   CGM “emphasizes mainly missionary work combined with sociological awareness of the target population.” In other words, it utilizes slick marketing techniques.  The object is to reach the “unchurched” using the age-old principle: You can draw more flies with honey than with vinegar.  Hence, the “<a href="http://apprising.org/2009/05/07/john-macarthur-seeker-friendly-movement-is-the-new-liberalism/" target="_blank">seeker-sensitive</a>” label.</p>
<p>Over the years Pastor Warren has become controversial, and rightly so, for a multitude of reasons which I’ve tackled <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/110124" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/120321" target="_blank">here</a>.  For one reason or another controversy continually swirls around “America’s Pastor.”  Still, he is highly regarded by many in the Christian community and likewise the press.   What’s stunning is that he’s often invited to speak at events with New Calvinist luminaries like John Piper, <a href="http://blogs.christianpost.com/marsha-west/profane-preachers-contribute-to-killing-the-conscience-12187/" target="_blank">Mark Driscoll</a>, James MacDonald and Matt Chandler.  Before I move on, I must bring to light influential Reformed theologian John Piper’s recent endorsement of Rick Warren.  Many of us in the discernment ministries were both surprised and troubled by his endorsement.  Christine Pack observed:</p>
<p><em>[Piper] gave his “stamp of approval” by having Warren be a keynote speaker at Dr. Piper&#8217;s annual Desiring God conference. This was an event that caught many in evangelicalism off guard and resulted in a flurry of articles and blog posts over a number of months. The problem with Dr. Piper welcoming Rick Warren into the fold is that Dr. Piper has long been known as a champion and protector of the purity of the gospel message.</em> (<a href="http://solasisters.blogspot.com/2012/02/does-rick-warren-still-get-dr-john.html" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Pastor celebrity James MacDonald was once asked to comment on the “seeker movement” and he replied, “The seeker movement [should be] subtitled: How to Fill Your Church with Tares.”  Later he publically affirmed Rick Warren in a <a href="http://www.raptureforums.com/forum/apostasy-local-church/55054-fiddle-dee-dee-rick-warren-james-macdonald.html" target="_blank">tweet</a> even knowing that the seeker movement that filled churches with heathens was the brain child of “possibility thinker” Robert Schuller.  His most recognized disciples are Bill Hybels and Rick Warren. Excuse me, but a shepherd’s duty is to point out error and guard the flock from wolves in sheep’s clothing, not to invite them into the sheep pen!</p>
<p>Sorry to digress.</p>
<p>Another prominent pastor who shares the stage with Rick Warren is Greg Laurie of Harvest Christian Fellowship, a Calvary Chapel in Riverside, CA.  Laurie is best known as the founder and featured speaker for Harvest Crusades.</p>
<p>So, what is going on in the visible Church?</p>
<p>Glad you asked.  In a word: syncretism. Syncretism occurs when elements of other religious beliefs are mashed into mainstream Protestant denominations. In a piece entitled Purpose Driven Dismantling of Christianity, I examined the effect syncretism has on the Church:</p>
<p><em>Satan uses syncretism to separate God from His people.</em><em> God loathes syncretism:</em></p>
<p><em>“When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land; Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.” (Deuteronomy 12:29-31)</em></p>
<p><em>Grievous wolves (</em><em>Acts 20:29) masquerading as evangelicals introduced false religious beliefs (abominations) into mainline churches. Many of them are forthcoming about what they&#8217;re doing, others not so much. Their main goal is … change. The plan (yes, they have a plan) is to dismantle historic orthodox Christianity and usher in a &#8220;new paradigm,&#8221; a &#8220;new kind of Christianity.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Wolves are skillful at drawing people in. They&#8217;ve learned how to use TV, radio, the Worldwide Web, human potential seminars, psycho-therapeutic counseling, so-called Christian entertainment that includes movies, DVDs, books and music. Some believers are drawn in through political groups. As you can see, a whole host of lures are used to bait the hook.</em></p>
<p><em>Many professing Christians have accepted the blending of religious beliefs with no questions asked. They sit in churches where they&#8217;re not taught the truth but are fed a steady diet of half truths and outright lies! Jesus wanted those who believe in Him to read and understand the Word. &#8220;Sanctify them through thy truth,&#8221; He prayed. &#8220;Thy Word is truth!&#8221; (</em><em>John 17:17 )</em> (<a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/110318" target="_blank">Source</a>)<em></em></p>
<p>Now, let’s get to my questions: Why did Rick Warren agree to do an interview with Oprah? Moreover, why would he want to be associated with word-faith heretic Joel Osteen?  We discover after the fact that he did not use the opportunity to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the lost, many of whom were tuned into the show.  No.  Instead he used his time with Oprah to pass on his sage advice to the audience, peppered with a few Bible quotes &#8212; taken out of context!</p>
<p>Former New Ager and astrologer Marcia Montenegro watched the 3 hours of live taping on Oprah’s Life class.  I think the following excerpt about what she observed clearly identifies the sort of pastor Rick Warren is:</p>
<p><em>Although Rick Warren has had New Age Dr. Oz at his church (along with a supposedly Christian doctor who also endorses some New Age practices), I was hoping he (RW) would somehow give the gospel in the midst of his motivational advice, but he never did. He used the imagery of a poker game to explain we are dealt certain cards, and then gave a teaching on this that sounded like moralistic self-help programs I’ve heard so many times, throwing in a few Bible quotes taken out of context or misquoted. It was something almost any New Ager could accept. God becomes a tool for self-improvement and success.</em></p>
<p>Warren referred to Jesus, but took scripture out of context and applied things said to believers to everyone. He also misused the Proverbs passage that says “as a man thinketh, so is he.” This passage is a famous passage misused by New Thought proponents and is used in “The Secret.”</p>
<p>What was really hard to watch is when a woman in Norway Skyped to say she realized she needed God but wanted to know who God is and she asked, “What should I do?” It was clear that she was ripe to hear the gospel and needed Jesus! It was a great opportunity to share the gospel with her, and at the same time, for Oprah to hear it. Instead of giving the gospel, Rick Warren seemed uncomfortable and finally just said something like, ‘Go to God and find your purpose.” It was a terrible moment! The woman looked surprised and sad, like she was expecting something else. I prayed for her later and am hoping that the many Christians who witnessed this will pray for her.</p>
<p>Not only that, but when Oprah referred to God, as she often did, Rick Warren agreed with her as though she was referring to the biblical God, which she was not. He even said a few times, “Oprah has a good point.” No, she never did! She was speaking totally out of her New Thought/New Age beliefs. I am grateful that RW recommended that people read the gospel of John. That was the best thing he said. (Read Marcia’s entire piece <a href="http://solasisters.blogspot.com/2012/10/rick-warren-and-joel-osteen-join-hands_6.html" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Why do so many followers of Jesus Christ view Rick Warren as dangerous?  Evangelist Tony Miano’sindictment is blunt:</p>
<p><em>Plastic pastors transparent enough to see through, like Joel Osteen, are not as dangerous as Rick Warren. Modalistic moguls of the painfully-obvious-money-hungry prosperity movement, like T.D. Jakes, are not as dangerous as Rick Warren. Self-serving sorcerers of the false signs and wonders movement, like Todd Bentley, are not as dangerous as Rick Warren. No. None of the before-mentioned personalities or groups are all that dangerous because what you see is what you get. They all lack the ability to change their appearance to accommodate a change in environment. They lack the chameleon-like ability, the self-serving ability, to say what needs to be said in order to keep people in every camp liking them. </em></p>
<p>Now listen to former Catholic Priest Richard Bennett:</p>
<p><em>Warren teaches that God &#8216;created the church to meet your five deepest needs&#8217; just as the Roman Catholic Church says, &#8216;The Church is the mother of all believers.&#8217; Warren, like Rome, has switched from obedience to the Word and Person of the Living God to submission to a church to achieve one&#8217;s needs. It is the oldest and cleverest temptation known to man. </em></p>
<p>I’ll close with warning from the Lord Jesus:</p>
<p><em>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous [ferocious] wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? <sup> </sup>Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. <sup> </sup>A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. <sup> </sup>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them.</em>(Mat. 5:15-20)</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/raptureforsale2.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/raptureforsale2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Apocalyptic fever is running high.  A friend in the Bible Belt, who recently became “born again,” called me excitedly to tell me she was leaving me her house. “In case I suddenly vanish,” she confided.</p>
<p>Of course.  She would be raptured up and I, a hard core “One God” believer, would be left behind. How sweet of her to make preparations for the damned.</p>
<p>But the projected date for the rapture came and went and disappointed, my friend abandoned her new found religion. Not so fast for the 2012-er&#8217;s however.  The end of the world is still scheduled for December 21, 2012 according to those who buy into the Mayan prophecies, Planet X, Niburu, exponential solar flares –did I miss anything?</p>
<p>The scenarios are stunning&#8212;tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, as the world comes crashing down around us.</p>
<p>And should we awaken the morning of December 22 to find ourselves still alive, the ratcheting up of doomsday prophecies will deflate like a spent balloon.</p>
<p>And we just may find ourselves sucker-punched.</p>
<p>Lurking right under our noses is the specter of what may occur in 2013.  While another war in the Middle East and a global pandemic might pale in comparison with the cataclysmic changes promised by the 2012-ers, the result might be very close to the same thing. We may not see the hand of God reach down and pluck His faithful from this troubled planet, we may not see  benign aliens beam themselves down into our living rooms while the walls are imploding around us, but the effect of what the governments of the world have cooked  up may result in a similar upheaval.</p>
<p>The announcements that the global pandemic will hit in 2013 have hardly been ear splitting.  One has to be attentive to find these predictions, which are being made by such insiders as former Senators Jim Talent and Bob Graham (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2M0eZ9GAdc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr>v=j2M0eZ9GAdc</wbr></a>) both of the WMD center (<a href="http://www.wmdcenter.org/" target="_blank">http://www.wmdcenter.org/</a>).  Also weighing in on the 2013 Big Bug scenario is Dr. Daniel Gerstein of the Department of Homeland Security. Gerstein made this prediction during a side event hosted by the US at the <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/12/questions-persist-as-to-us-arms-treaty.html">Biological Weapons Convention</a> just last December. </p>
<p>And what would be the connection between a global pandemic and those attending to biological weapons, like Graham, Talent and Gerstein?</p>
<p>A parallel thread runs through this last decade, right alongside the events of 911 and the fallout from that event. The parallel thread pertains to the anthrax attacks, which took place only one week later. Our government responded to the attacks of 911 with a Draconian shift towards a top heavy surveillance society and a concomitant stripping of our civil liberties, all of which has  made us increasingly vulnerable to government intrusion and attack.  Emphasis on the word “attack.” The response to the anthrax mailings was to invest billions of dollars in a biological warfare program for which there is no transparency and no public oversight.</p>
<p>Since September of 2001, the U.S. government has pumped over 60 billion dollars into what it euphemistically terms “biodefense.” Let&#8217;s take a moment to consider what has gone into that program and what has come out the other end.  The concept of “dual use” is the first thing we must consider in order to understand what constitutes “biodefense.”  To put it simply, dual use means that you first have to create the bug in order to find the cure.</p>
<p>And our biodefense program is top heavy with bugs: ebola, marburg, anthrax, we got ‘em and we are secretly working to cut and splice natural horrors into recombinant nightmares.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the crux of the matter.  What goes on in these “biodefense” labs  are occluded by protestations of “national security.” The now defunct Sunshine Project, which was dedicated to   working “against the hostile use of biotechnology in the post-Cold War era,” found that there was little if  any oversight as to the types of research going on in these labs.  In 2007,  in a <a href="http://www.nobio.org/hammondtestimony.pdf">report</a> submitted to the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce for the Hearing: Germs, Viruses, and Secrets: The Silent Proliferation of Bio-Laboratories in the United States, Sunshine Project Director Edward Hammond wrote the following: “Our research indicates that in the vast majority of cases, it is not possible to verify that federally funded research is properly overseen at the local level, nor are the local committees that are charged with overseeing this research actually required to produce meeting minutes or annual reports that demonstrate that they have fulfilled this charge.” Elsewhere in the report, he states that “lab expansion under the Bush administration has gone far beyond what is prudent and necessary, and without an adequate regulatory framework.”</p>
<p>In summary, Hammond blasted the biodefense industry and wrote “The proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories across the United States since 2002 is greater than what our country needs and what its safety and security net can absorb. One-off NEPA processes are not sufficient or appropriate for this national-scale problem .Congress should impose a moratorium on federal funding for construction and commissioning of new biodefense labs. No new construction contracts should be issued, and no new labs should open until a comprehensive needs assessment is performed by the Government Accountability Office.”</p>
<p>One must ask what has come out of all these billions pumped into biodefense.  The answer is clouded. We do know that we have not even produced a second generation anthrax vaccine. The first generation anthrax vaccine was reputed to cause Gulf War Syndrome and other ills. A scientist working in a BSL-3 in Arizona proudly informed me recently that he has developed a smallpox vaccine that also cures herpes.  Awesome, bro&#8230;except we pretty much stomped out smallpox decades ago&#8230;.</p>
<p>When informed of the plans for a new biodefense campus at Ft. Detrick, Maryland, local activists became alarmed.   Beth Willis, chairwoman of the Frederick County Containment Lab Advisory Committee and founder of Frederick Citizens for Biolab safety, has stated concerns that the plans for the Homeland Security lab at Detrick may be in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention.  The DHS facility has opened but is not yet fully operational. While some of the Frederick activists have stopped short of declaring that the US has indeed launched an offensive biological weapons program, others are not so shy. Barry Kissin, an attorney and activist in Frederick has stated that the US is now illegally producing and stockpiling biological weapons.</p>
<p>In order to produce biological weapons you must first have a lab, properly outfitted for the seriousness of bug you are working with. The labs are designated from BSL-1 through 5, with the 3’s and 4’s housing the most dangerous bugs known to man. The 5&#8242;s purportedly deal with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety">space bugs</a>, although you wouldn´t ever hear that from the CDC. That agency recently responded to a FOIA Request about the containment specifications for the 5’s, stating that these records were not in their office. The CDC, which has the responsibility for tracking these bugs and registering the labs, is furiously shoveling out disinfo about the proliferations of 3’s and 4’s ,   tripping over itself in its eagerness to convince us that there are no more BSL-3 and 4 labs than before 911.</p>
<p>In fact, the proliferation of these labs has been astounding. There are at least 1360 BSL-3&#8242;s at this juncture, according to documents released by the DOJ and DOE  (although the CDC insists the number is closer to 250).  The CDC can only count as far as six when it comes to BSL-4s, although independent sources, such as the Federation for American Scientists, have come up with a head count of 13. Factor in the existence of secret labs on military bases, evidenced by the C.V.&#8217;s of a couple of engineering firms which proudly state that they constructed BSL-4s on at least two  bases, and the numbers of these labs , like Topsy, just keep on growing.</p>
<p>If a global pandemic should hit in 2013, the chances are good that we will have caused it through the release of a biological weapon that has been cooked up in one of these labs. The similarities between what is now happening in the US and what happened in Germany in the thirties are perturbing: A false flag event used to topple our civil rights and a project to poison us with &#8230;well, this time it won&#8217;t be Zyklon- B.</p>
<p>If our government learned anything from the mistakes made by Adolph Hitler, it was to keep appearances up.  The public image maintained by the United States is that of freedom and justice. The image is straining due to the weight of evidence to the contrary, and the more evidence that accumulates the higher pitched are the denials being issued by the State.</p>
<p>This reporter has been working off information provided by a high level source back in 2003, when he confided that the State of Israel would be destroyed around the time that the bugs were selectively released.   Israel, you say?  You thought Israel was pulling the strings all along, did you?</p>
<p>Israel was very likely set up to be destroyed.  A haven for the Jews after the horrific events of WWII and the holocaust morphed into a ghetto for those far- flung in the diaspora.  Forty percent of the world’s Jews now reside in Israel. A well placed missile or two and you&#8217;ve gotten rid of 7,848,800 people–approximately 5,865,300 are Jews.  Hitler will be high- fiving from the seventh circle of Hell.</p>
<p>The government of Israel is just itching to get into this war with Iran, a war for which Israel is poorly prepared, defensively speaking.  The much touted  “Iron dome”, Israel’s primary missile defense system, only works for incoming projectiles that are launched from nearby, like Gaza.  Israel is largely unprotected from a fly- over. Factor in the state- of- the- art S-300 defense system possessed by Iran, and the odds that Israel will survive this war appear to be almost non- existent.</p>
<p>Israel wiped off the map due to all the trouble fomented by the United States in the Middle East, culminating with a manufactured war with Iran and then a fatal bug, released through a selective mechanism such as the double line water system (<a href="http://neworleans.indymedia.org/news/2007/05/10214.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://neworleans.indymedia.<wbr>org/news/2007/05/10214.php</wbr></a>) or the imposter pharmaceuticals&#8212; and  there you have the makings of another  holocaust, all done under the mantle of plausible deniability.  The US comes out squeaky clean, as it scampers to innoculate its citizenry with vaccinations which may serve to further reduce its population, while insisting that all along, we tried to support Israel.</p>
<p>The hell, you say. The Zionists run the world! Well, yes and no. If the Zionists are the same guys, heavily anti-Semitic, (such as Mark Sykes and Otto Rand, ) who set up the State of Israel in order to lure the world’s Jews into that alleged haven—a desert mirage&#8211; so that Boom! Then yes, those Zionists may indeed run the world. And some of those Zionists are Jews. The Jews are ill informed as to the traitors within their midst, the same sort of saboteurs as Stephen Wise, head of the US Jewish Congress during WWII.  Wise lobbied heavily to keep the Eastern European Jews from immigrating to the United States, thus ensuring they would be unable to escape Hitler’s death machine. This reporter has had her own skirmishes with duplicitous leadership in the Jewish community, some of which are discussed in this <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/08/our-spiritual-leadership-stumbles-and.html">article</a>.</p>
<p>And please, don&#8217;t get me wrong. The Jews are certainly not the only ones on the chopping block. When the dust clears, after the Big Bug strikes, we will likely see a world divested of much of its people of color. This is already happening.</p>
<p>Africa is being emptied out by AIDS.  Dark- skinned people are also now experiencing an epidemic of the “silent killers” of diabetes and hypertension, believed to be a product of a biological weapon leaked into food and attaching onto melanin (those with darker skin have more melanin). According to Dr. Trudy Gaillard, a researcher and with the Wexner Medical Center, about 12% of African Americans are now diagnosed with diabetes, three times as many as reported in 1980.  The actual figures may be quite a bit higher. If you look at the statistics for African American women over the age of 55, 25% are now diagnosed with diabetes.  The numbers are also up for other dark- skinned groups, such as indigenous Mexicans and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>Dr. Wouter Basson, who sailed through the South African Truth and Reconciliation hearings, was under scrutiny for his work with Project Coast, which was the apartheid government’s biological weapons group.  Basson was purportedly working on developing a “blacks only” bioweapons back in the 1980’s  The epidemic of diabetes and hypertension among people of color began to surface shortly thereafter. Was Basson successful in creating this race specific bioweapons? He ain’t talking.</p>
<p>And, as a writer-friend in Los Angeles once noted, “Anyone who will sell out his brother for his own safety gets to sit at the table.” The resonant and beautiful voices of resistance may also succumb to the selectively delivered Big Bug.  How convenient and diabolical this plan is.  Any problem person, any out- of -favor demographic group, and our beneficent government utilities and/or Big Pharma will provide the final solution. No recriminations and no onus of responsibility. No Nuremberg Trials, no Truth and Reconciliation Commission and no one pointing the finger at anything except a wayward microbe, an accident of nature.</p>
<p>Just a whole lot of burying to do and the world made over, in a different image: Obedient and lily white. A Nazi&#8217;s wet dream.</p>
<p>The Biological Weapons Convention will meet twice this year in Geneva for intersessional meetings.  I hope to be able to attend in an effort to impact the direction of the above cited course of events. I need your help to do so. Please visit <a href="http://janetphelan.com/" target="_blank">janetphelan.com</a> to contribute for travel expenses via PayPal.  At the BWC in December, I <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=13482">blew the whistle</a> on the illegal biological weapons program being run by the United States government. It was a good beginning and so much more needs to be done. The time is short.</p>

				<p>April 10, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14397#comments" title="Comment on A Simple Explanation of Scofield Dispensationalism"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="14397 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=14397">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rapturecemetary3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/rapturecemetary2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>A flaw foundation lies under most evangelicals’ understanding of God&#8217;s moral dealings with humanity and particularly Jews. This foundation drives their support of the Jewish state. It is called “Scofield Dispensationalism.” It says that throughout successive epics, or &#8220;dispensations,&#8221; of time God has revealed Himself through extremely different moral standards. The law given before the Flood was different from the law after. The law given to Moses is completely different from what we now observe in the millennia after Christ. Cyrus Scofield lived at the turn of the 20th century and created an annotated Bible which claimed to lay out each dispensation&#8217;s unique requirements.</p>
<p>Scofield&#8217;s commentaries have greatly influenced evangelicals to this day. Written at the dawn of the modern Zionist movement, they suggested a nation of suffering and persecuted Jews, though Christ-rejecting, had a divine right to return and occupy Palestine.  This idea was virtually absent from Christianity before the mid-1800s. How did such permission gain so great a foothold that it’s now unquestioned dogma for most evangelicals?</p>
<p>It starts with a defect in the King James Bible. King James scholars mistranslated 2 Thess. 2:7.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only He who now letteth [restrains] will let, until He be taken out of the way. And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming…</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual New Testament Greek says the one who restrains, the Holy Spirit, is <em>not</em> passively removed. Instead He &#8220;gets out of the way&#8221; or &#8220;steps aside&#8221; (<em>ek meseu genetai</em>). The Holy Spirit is never going to be taken out of this world. God owns the world. He is not about to be removed by a mere satanically inhabited man, Anti-Christ.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years Christians were unbothered by the King James Bible&#8217;s error. Yet in the first half of the 19th century, a Scottish Presbyterian minister, Edward Irving, seized on the mistranslated passage. He saw its profound prophetic implications. He said that since the Holy Spirit would be removed from this world just prior to revealing of Anti-Christ, so Christ&#8217;s church must also be removed, for Christians cannot function without the Holy Spirit. That removal is described, they said, in 1 Thess. 4:16.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. . .&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, said Irving and his later disciple, John Nelson Darby, these passages from II Thessalonians suggest <em>two </em>second comings of Christ: the first, when Christ descends and removes the Holy Spirit and all believers, both dead and living unto Himself. Then, three and half, He comes a second time. In His final second coming He converts remnant Jews, judges the nations, and begins His thousand-year reign on earth from Jerusalem.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Beginnings of &#8220;Pre-Tribulationism&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Irving and Darby&#8217;s &#8220;prophetic breakthrough&#8221; had an electric appeal to evangelical Christians, particularly in the British Isles and North America. It assured Christians that, “raptured,” they would not have to endure the suffering that follows revealing of Anti-Christ. Thus began the &#8220;pre-tribulationist&#8221; interpretation of Bible prophecy. It started with a mistranslation of one verse by King James scholars. Incredibly, that disastrous mistranslation is repeated in most modern translations of the Bible.</p>
<p>Enter Cyrus Scofield.  He did not originate the pre-tribulationist rapture craze that has enthralled evangelicals and made millionaires of &#8220;prophecy experts” such as Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHaye. Yet Scofield did something far more damaging: he laid the keel of Christian Zionism. He taught that, under the dispensation Abraham was in, God gave the patriarch and his physical descendants unconditional rights as God&#8217;s chosen people. They were guaranteed the Promised Land and rights of occupation, even without obedience. Scofield said Israelites automatically receive “all blessings” by just being there.</p>
<p>Yet Scofield said Jacob and his sons, during world famine, unwisely left security in Palestine and went to Egypt. In doing so, he claims, they lost their ability to please God by simply staying in the Holy Land. Scofield contends that, even worse, they foolishly accepted the Mosaic Law at Sinai 400 years later. The Law imposed on them an onerous obligation to obey God on penalty of exile. Such conditional terms of occupation, Scofield said, didn’t exist under the &#8220;pure grace&#8221; that Abraham and his descendants enjoyed while in Palestine. (See, <a href="http://truthtellers.org/biblestudies/ConditionalSalvationVerseList.html" target="_blank">List of Conditional Salvation/Occupation Verses</a>)</p>
<p>Scofield said of the dispensation and covenant Abraham enjoyed:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>That covenant is wholly gracious and unconditional. The descendants of Abraham had but to abide in their own land to inherit every blessing. In Egypt they lost their blessings, but not their covenant. The dispensation of promise ended when Israel rashly accepted the Law (Ex. 19:8). Grace had prepared a deliverer (Moses), provided a sacrifice for the guilty, and by divine power had brought them out of bondage (Ex. 19:4); but at Sinai they exchanged grace for law. (<em>Scofield Reference Bible, </em>1909, page 20)</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Scofield conveniently omits the biblical record that God powerfully delivered Jacob and his sons from death by famine, providing safe haven for them under Joseph&#8217;s protection in Egypt. Similarly, God <em>commanded</em> the Hebrews at Sinai to obey the Mosaic Law. Scofield&#8217;s idea that simply staying in Canaan guaranteed to Hebrews &#8220;every blessing&#8221; is an affront to God&#8217;s timeless moral standards which say that in every age we are justified by trusting and obeying God. Only through such faith do we inherit &#8220;every blessing&#8221; from Him. Scofield&#8217;s view of the sanctifying power of the Holy Land, even for reprobate Jews, powerfully anticipated the teachings of the most extreme present day Israel-firsters who believe Jews to be so morally advantaged that they have a separate covenant of salvation and land rights without obedience to Christ.</p>
<p>Yet, Scofield said, when Jesus came and died at Calvary, God returned to a dispensation entirely of grace. This, by inference, means to millions of evangelical readers of the Scofield Bible that our present “age of grace” does away with the requirement of dozens of Old Testament verses demanding obedience for Jews to occupy Palestine.</p>
<p>Scofield, as no other figure, legitimized Christian participation in a Jewish political movement: Zionism. Evangelicals then united pretribulationism and its “rapture escapism” with Zionism. The new prophetic script for Christians read like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The right of God’s dispersed and persecuted chosen people to the Promised Land is covenanted to them by God unconditionally, forever. It is the duty of every Christian to honor God’s great last day’s regathering of His people, bidding them godspeed by any possible means. If any nation or person refuses to stand by God and the Jewish nation, he is in league with Satan.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Satan desires above all things to obscure the fact that Israel makes possible fulfillment of biblical prophecy that empowers Jesus to return as predicted. Without Israel’s existence and the hundreds of prophecies it fulfills, Christ cannot return. Christ stated clearly that “it must needs be that Scripture be fulfilled” before He could go forward with God’s plan.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Criticizing the state of Israel is thus to oppose the Almighty. It is to curse the Jewish people, incurring dire judgment. “I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you…” (Genesis 12:3)  </em></strong></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In accordance with an end-times storyline created by Darby, Irving and Scofield, Zionist evangelicals now keenly watch Israel for necessary fulfillment of the following Scriptural predictions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rebuilding a Jewish temple. The new temple is necessary because Scripture says anti-Christ must profane it and sit in it proclaiming himself to be god. Without such a temple and its defilement, Christ cannot return as He predicted.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Israel enters a “covenant” or peace treaty with Anti-Christ.<br />
</strong><strong>Once such a covenant has taken place, Daniel’s prophetic “clock” of a “week” or seven years leading to Christ’s <em>second </em>second coming will begin to tick.</strong><strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem, however, for pretribulationists is this: If the church is to be raptured when the anti-Christ is “revealed,” what does Scripture mean by that term? Does it mean “revealed” as in anti-Christ signing a peace treaty with Israel or “revealed” such as occurs in the middle of Daniel’s week when anti-Christ manifests himself as the enemy of the Jews, bringing his armies against Jerusalem (Ez. 38). At that time, he desecrates the temple, kills two thirds of Jerusalem’s inhabitants, and exiles the remainder to the nations. Also, since most evangelicals believe Christ could come in his first second coming and rapture us out without preconditons, perhaps we will not even have to wait for the “revealing” of Anti-Christ at all.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Zionist evangelical prophetic scenario at this point becomes very clouded. But it is not at all clouded up to that point. The pretribulationist view point could not be simpler in its obligations: Dark as the world may become, if the church above all things makes sure to bless Israel, it will be blessed and kept safe. Jesus will be faithful to take out true believers before anything resembling great tribulation begins. In reality, nothing could be more unbiblical, corruptive to the church and the Jewish people, and ultimately dangerous to Christianity than building up that Zionist one-world system of oppression Scripture calls Babylon the Great. (See, <a href="http://truthtellers.org/alerts/babylonthegreatisrael.htm" target="_blank">&#8216;Babylon the Great&#8217; is Israel</a>)</p>
<p>Pre-tribulationism is thus escapism. Calvinists also very largely adhere to this idea.  It fits well with their belief that once we are soundly “born again” we are always saved, even if committing the grossest sin. If we as citizens fail in our duty to occupy and resist evil, this Calvinist/pretribulationist theology says Jesus understands. He will not require us to bear the consequences of our neglect. We will soon be gone. The consequences will be passed on to those of our children who are not born again, not fortunate enough to be raptured.</p>
<p>Of course, Scripture does promise a first resurrection or “rapture” of the dead and living of Christ at <em>His </em>second coming. Yet a high percentage of evangelicals actually believe the rapture will occur within several years. What’s the point of knocking ourselves out opposing evil, especially as Jewish big media corrupts our children…because very soon we’ll be in heaven? (See, <a href="http://truthtellers.org/alerts/jewsconfirmbigmediaupdated.html" target="_blank">Jews Confirm Big Media is Jewish</a>)</p>
<p>We clearly see such apathy right now as ABC gores the church through its Christian-bashing sitcom “Good Christian Bitches.” But there is a virtual absence of Christian willingness to publicly oppose it. This largely originates in the ingrained belief that, if the power of evil proves too great, Christ no longer expects us to be the salt of the earth, resisting evil with all that is within us. Instead, we should buckle up for heavenly removal.</p>
<p>Yet Jesus said that the church would <em>not</em> be taken out of tribulation. Instead, He said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation.” (John 16:33) In China before 1949 a highly evangelized Chinese population also accepted pre-tribulationism, believing the church had little to fear from “anti-Christ” Mao Tse Tung and his armies. They would be raptured before great tribulation came. Yet deliverance for millions of pre-tribulationist Chinese came not through rapture, but death.</p>
<p>One of the paramount reasons Christians must understand <em>how</em> the church has gone so far astray is so we may marshal ourselves to hold back anti-Christian offensives leading to persecution. “Good Christian Bitches” is one such offensive that simply must not remain unopposed. If it is, it will only beget worse attacks, leading to outright persecution. Someday, if the church remains apathetic and pre-tribulationist like the Chinese Christians, American Christians will be standing in front of firing squads. They are about to be taken out of this world, not out of the mercy of the rapture, but the &#8220;mercy&#8221; of a bullet.</p>

Major Ron Kelley as he and other American troops prepared to leave Iraq in mid-December. &#8220;We have done a great thing as a nation. We freed a people and gave their country back to them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&#8220;It is pretty exciting,&#8221; said another young American soldier in Iraq. &#8220;We are going down in the history books, you might say.&#8221; (<em>Washington Post</em>, December 18, 2011)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Ah yes, the history books, the multi-volume leather-bound set of &#8220;The Greatest Destructions of One Country by Another.&#8221; The newest volume can relate, with numerous graphic photos, how the modern, educated, advanced nation of Iraq was reduced to a quasi failed state; how the Americans, beginning in 1991, bombed for 12 years, with one dubious excuse or another; then invaded, then occupied, overthrew the government, tortured without inhibition, killed wantonly, &#8230; how the people of that unhappy land lost everything — their homes, their schools, their electricity, their clean water, their environment, their neighborhoods, their mosques, their archaeology, their jobs, their careers, their professionals, their state-run enterprises, their physical health, their mental health, their health care, their welfare state, their women&#8217;s rights, their religious tolerance, their safety, their security, their children, their parents, their past, their present, their future, their lives &#8230; More than half the population either dead, wounded, traumatized, in prison, internally displaced, or in foreign exile &#8230; The air, soil, water, blood, and genes drenched with depleted uranium &#8230; the most awful birth defects &#8230; unexploded cluster bombs lying anywhere in wait for children to pick them up &#8230; a river of blood running alongside the Euphrates and Tigris &#8230; through a country that may never be put back together again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&#8220;It is a common refrain among war-weary Iraqis that things were better before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003,&#8221; reported the <em>Washington Post</em> on May 5, 2007.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">No matter &#8230; drum roll, please &#8230; Stand tall American GI hero! And don&#8217;t even <em>think</em> of ever apologizing or paying any reparations. Iraq is forced by Washington to continue paying reparations to Kuwait for Iraq&#8217;s invasion in 1990 (an invasion instigated in no small measure by the United States). And — deep breath here! — Vietnam has been compensating the United States. Since 1997 Hanoi has been paying off about $145 million in debts left by the defeated South Vietnamese government for American food and infrastructure aid. Thus, Hanoi is reimbursing the United States for part of the cost of the war waged against it. (William Blum, <em>Rogue State</em>, p.304) How much will the United States pay the people of Iraq?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">On December 14, at the Fort Bragg, North Carolina military base, Barack Obama stood before an audience of soldiers to speak about the Iraq war. It was a moment in which the president of the United States found it within his heart and soul — as well as within his oft-praised (supposed) intellect — to proclaim:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">This is an extraordinary achievement, nearly nine years in the making. And today, we remember everything that you did to make it possible. &#8230; Years from now, your legacy will endure. In the names of your fallen comrades etched on headstones at Arlington, and the quiet memorials across our country. In the whispered words of admiration as you march in parades, and in the freedom of our children and grandchildren. &#8230; So God bless you all, God bless your families, and God bless the United States of America. &#8230; You have earned your place in history because you sacrificed so much for people you have never met.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Does Mr. Obama, the Peace Laureate, believe the words that come out of his mouth?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Barack H. Obama believes only in being the President of the United States. It is the only strong belief the man holds.</span></p>

<li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">In a letter released August 17, 2006, 21 former generals and high ranking national security officials called on President George W.

<li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">President Obama should accompany the military people when they inform parents that their child has died in the latest of America&#8217;s never-ending wars. And maybe ask George W. to come along as well.</span></li>

<li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie and an illusion that we have an inefficient government.

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/fortune-teller-and-crystal-ball3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/fortune-teller-and-crystal-ball2.jpg" alt="bank fees" /></a>I just had a dream that it was the end of the world. So should I still go Christmas shopping or not?  Why bother, I thought.  But just to be on the safe side, I also asked the mysterious psychic Madam Jane for some input.  &#8220;Are my dreams and the Mayan calendars and all those Rapture freaks right?  Is the end of the world actually on its way?  Are we really all gonna die soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes of course,&#8221; replied Madam Jane.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is mounting at a catastrophic rate and will cause irreversibly-disastrous climate change in the next five years &#8212; and by far the biggest cause of this problem is the U.S. military and its allies.  Every time NATO bombs Libya and Americans bomb Pakistan and Israel bombs Gaza or a helicopter takes off in Afghanistan or a U.S. carrier fleet steams toward Syria and the Persian Gulf, we move one step closer to irreversible climate change,&#8221; stated Madam Jane, swaying back and forth with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it help at all if I had my car smog-checked today?&#8221; I then asked her hopefully.  Madame Jane just rolled her eyes.   &#8220;We&#8217;re doomed,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>So.  How do I want to spend my last days here on Earth?  Not a clue.  If you knew that seven billion people had approximately five years to live before climate-change-caused floods started pouring in from our rivers, and deserts started taking over our farmlands and oceans started drowning our coastal cities and a dreadful ice age started to set in, what would you do?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d move to Hawaii,&#8221; replied Madam Jane.  Not me.  I&#8217;d buy hip-waders, ear muffs and really warm coats.</p>
<p>PS:  According to a recent AlterNet article entitled &#8220;Game Over for Planet Earth,&#8221; we&#8217;re all gonna be fried like fish in a skillet first before we even get a chance to freeze to death or drown.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_IPmZOwAnYc/TtfyuJyDIiI/AAAAAAAAF_Y/nxHW01r17tw/s1600/IMG_4271.JPG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_IPmZOwAnYc/TtfyuJyDIiI/AAAAAAAAF_Y/nxHW01r17tw/s200/IMG_4271.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>      <a href="http://www.alternet.org/economy/153092/game_over_for_planet_earth%3A_the_month%E2%80%99s_biggest_story_you_never_read">AlterNet says</a>, &#8220;[Here's a] prediction offered by Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency:  Without an effective international agreement to staunch greenhouse gases within five years, the door will close on preventing a potentially disastrous rise in the planet’s temperature.&#8221;</p>
<p>PPS:  Madam Jane&#8217;s ominous-sounding and doom-like claim that irreversible climate change is only five years away is actually erroneous.  And AlterNet&#8217;s five-year claim is wrong too.  According to the Christian Science Monitor, irreversible climate change is already here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if all the world&#8217;s smokestacks and tailpipes were to suddenly stop spewing CO2, if all the trees everywhere were to be left standing, and if all the remaining coal, oil, and gas were to stay in the ground [and the American war-machine would suddenly stop spewing CO2 like there's no tomorrow as well], the planet would still be <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Bright-Green/2009/0127/report-calls-climate-change-irreversible">feeling the effects of global warming</a> a millennium from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>PPPS:  How can we keep cheering on American wars abroad &#8212; without bringing those wars back home to us too, like the recent violent shootings in Oakland and the recent pepper-spraying at U.C. Davis?</p>
<p>My Christmas shopping may just have to wait.</p>
<p>EXTRA!  EXTRA!  Madam Jane also predicts that the &#8220;American war&#8221; on Iran is about to happen too!</p>
<p>Remember back when, long before the war on Iraq was declared, millions of tons of war material was being amassed at various East Coast military bases here in the U.S.?  Well, Madam Jane states that they are at it again.  &#8220;Long endless lines of container trucks are currently pouring into supply depots all over the East Coast.&#8221;  Oops.</p>
<p>Plus America&#8217;s bottom-kissing &#8220;yellow journalism&#8221; media is already geared up to make Iran look like the ultimate bad guy &#8212; just as it did right before Bush&#8217;s illegal invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>And not only that but, according to Middle East specialist <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/david-pratt/demonisation-of-iran-carries-a-whiff-of-war-1.1137797?18451">David Pratt</a>, the video game Battlefield 3 has just come out with a brand new version &#8212; starring good old Iran as the penultimate evil villain.  It just doesn&#8217;t get any more &#8220;War Profiteers Gone Crazy&#8221; than that!</p>
<p>And when Iran does get attacked, just THINK of all the air pollution that will be released!  Good grief.  Then Battlefield 3 will have to put out an even newer version &#8212; featuring deadly hand-to-hand combat with radioactive smog.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/zion-book-cover-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/zion-book-cover-2.jpg" alt="" /></a>Many American Christian Evangelicals interpreted the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the return of the Jews to the Hebrews ancient homeland as a precondition for the Second Coming of Christ.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans believe in the theology espoused in the “Left Behind” series of novels that chronicle apocalyptic times set in the 21st century that winds up in Israel where, according to the author’s understanding of the Book of Revelation, the final battle in the world will be fought on an ancient battlefield called Armageddon. These literalists believe that war will be followed by seven years of global tribulation before Jesus returns to begin a 1,000-year rule on earth; but the Jews and all others who do not believe Jesus is God will be annihilated.</p>
<p>The bottom and nearly the last line in the book of Revelation is this warning:</p>
<p>“I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.</p>
<p>These fundamentalists also believe that the only Jews who are following God are the hard line Jewish fundamentalist settlers who occupy legally owned Palestinian property in the West Bank and who were evacuated from Gaza in 2005. The Jewish settlers and Christian fundamentalists share the core conviction that God made a real estate deal with the ancient Hebrews that gives 21st century Jews every grain of sand between the Dead Sea, the Jordan River, and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>My first book,<em> KEEP HOPE ALIVE</em> counters the theology found in the <em>Left Behind</em> series and the fictional character, Brother Harold nails this particular fundamentalist misunderstanding in Chapter 8</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Click here for details" href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26"><img src="http://wearewideawake.org/images/stories/Finalcover.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="213" border="0" hspace="0" /></a></p>
<p>Harold lifted his almost empty pouch of Crown Royal and exclaimed, “Let’s toast the man, and then I’ll tell you what my daddy told me when I was a kid, when my brothers and I would get out of hand. He’d say, ‘boys, you all are going the way of Cain and Abel, and you’d better quit. For one of those boys was filled with so much hatred and jealousy that he killed the other.’</p>
<p>“Then my old man would be on a roll, and he’d tell us about Sarah, Abraham’s wife. And we loved to hear that part, so we’d quit our fight. You see, although Sarah was already menopaused, she still desired a child. God had even shared a laugh with her about it coming true, but just like a woman, she took the matter into her own hands, and refused to wait for the Lord to deliver. So old Sarah decided to give her maidservant to her old man, and that chick and Abraham made a kid. Everything was fine when Ishmael arrived, but only for a very short while.</p>
<p>“Now, although Sarah was a dried-up old crone, she, too, birthed a son, and named him after the laughter she had shared with God, but called the kid Isaac. Sarah had gotten very territorial and demanded Abraham cast out his beloved first son with his mama Haggar, into the barren wilderness, and Abraham did it! But, as God always hears the cries of mothers and sons, he promised to make a great nation from Ishmael’s descendants, too. And thus, the Arab nation was born.</p>
<p>“By the sixth century before Christ, the conflicts in the land were already old news, and Jeremiah warned the people that all God could see was violence and destruction in the city. Sickness and wounds were all around.</p>
<p>“And then my old man would get tears in his eyes and softly recite:</p>
<p>“For every misunderstanding, every condemning thought, every negative vibration, every tear torn from a heart, every time one grabbed and wouldn’t let go, and they only did it because they did not know. The Divine is within all creation and within all women and men.</p>
<p>“And every tiny kindness you have ever done, every gentle word spoken, every time you held your tongue, every positive thought, every smile freely given, every helping hand that opens, helps bring in the kingdom. And the kingdom comes from above, and it comes from within. Imagine a kingdom of sisterhood of all creatures and all men.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Sizer’s timely focus on the Holy Land, in particular Jerusalem, The Temple and the future of the world juxtaposed with the current political climate and neo-con ideology could wake up many American Christians who have been led astray by the heretical teachings of John Hagee, Hal Lindsay and Tim LaHaye.</p>
<p>The vast majority of American Christians are unaware that since 1948, the indigenous Christian population of the land we call Holy has gone from 20% of the total population to less than 1.3% today.</p>
<p>Scholars and researches claim that unless things change asap, there will be no Christian witness in the land where Jesus promised that it is the Peacemakers who are the children of God by 2020!</p>
<p>“It is irresponsible to suggest that God will bless us materially if we support the largely secular State of Israel, especially when this invariably means ignoring the plight of the indigenous Christian population of Palestine.”-page 46, Zion’s Christian Soldiers</p>
<p>Sizer’s previous book Christian Zionism-Road Map to Armageddon? is the companion text to ZION’S CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS? which details how a cultish escapist theology fused with neo-con political ideology which has lead millions of US Christians astray as it tips the world on its side heavy with military artillery.</p>
<p>“Zion’s Christian Soldiers” utilizes easy to comprehend diagrams and thought provoking end of chapter questions that could help bring American Bible Study programs into the 21st Century and infuse them with a much needed breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Having been to Israel Palestine seven times since June 2005, I highly recommend Sizer’s scholarly yet easy to comprehend work to all Christians who have the courage to face reality and reclaim the gospel Jesus taught which is The Peacemakers are the children of God.</p>
<p>Sizer’s struggle is also intended to provoke Christians to remember that the Prince of Peace is the fulfillment of the Hebrew scriptures as fundamentalist militant minded Christians have replaced Jesus with the state of Israel.</p>

<p>What follows is an excerpt from Sizer’s Seven Biblical Answers to Popular Zionist Assumptions can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.sizers.org/articles/7answers.pdf">http://www.sizers.org/articles/7answers.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote><p>God blesses those who bless Israel and curses those who curse Israel</p>
<p>“I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you” (Genesis 12:2-3). The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ… There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:16, 28-29)</p>
<p>“I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore… and through your seed all nations on earth will be blessed…” (Genesis 22:17-18)</p>
<p>This popular assumption is based on Genesis 12:3. First, note that the promise was made to Abram (that is, Abraham) and no one else. Second, there is nothing in the text to indicate God intended the promise to apply to Abraham’s physical descendants unconditionally, or in perpetuity. Third, in the New Testament we are told explicitly that the promises were fulfilled in Jesus Christ and in those who acknowledge Him as their Lord and Saviour. God’s blessings come by grace through faith, not by works or race (Ephesians 2:8-9).</p>
<p>The “Promised Land” was given by God to the Jewish people as an everlasting inheritance</p>
<p>Contrary to popular assumption, the Scriptures repeatedly insist that the land belongs to God and that residence is always conditional.</p>
<p>For example, God said to his people, “‘The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as foreigners and strangers.” (Leviticus 25:23). In Ezekiel, it seems the Lord anticipated the reasoning of those who arrogantly claimed rights to the land because of the covenant originally made with Abraham.</p>
<p>“Son of man, the people living in those ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as our possession.’ Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood, should you then possess the land? You rely on your sword, you do detestable things… Should you then possess the land?’ … I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end.’ (Ezekiel 33:24-26,28-29)</p>
<p>Residence was open to all God’s people on the basis of faith not race. Indeed, the writer to Hebrews explains that the land was never their ultimate desire or inheritance any way but a temporary residence until the coming of Jesus Christ. Our shared eternal inheritance is heavenly not earthly.</p>
<p>Jerusalem is the exclusive and undivided, eternal capital of the Jewish people</p>
<p>The Christian Zionist assertion that God intended Jerusalem to be the exclusive and undivided eternal capital of the Jewish people has no basis whatsoever in Scripture. God insists in Psalm 87 that Jerusalem must be a shared and inclusive city. Nations specifically mentioned include what is today, Egypt, Iran and Lebanon. Even the hated Philistines are mentioned as “…born in Zion” on the basis of faith not race. Likewise, the vision of Isaiah 2 associates Jerusalem with the end of war, with peace and reconciliation.</p>
<p>“In the last days the mountain of the LORD’s temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it. Many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.” (Isaiah 2:2-3)</p>
<p>But what of Luke 21:24, “Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled”? The assertion that this prophecy came true in 1967 is problematic since Revelation 11:2 says the Gentile ‘trampling’ of Jerusalem would last only ’42 months’. The context of Luke 21 shows Jesus was referring to the events of 70AD and God’s sovereign use of foreign tyrants to fulfil his purposes. The focus of the New Testament instead moves away from the earthly Jerusalem toward the new, heavenly Jerusalem as the home of all who trust in Jesus (Hebrews 12:22-23; Revelation 21:2; 22-27).</p>
<p>Believers will soon be ‘raptured’ to heaven before the ‘end-time’ battle of Armageddon</p>
<p>The rapture is a popular idea that Jesus will actually return twice: first of all secretly, to rescue true believers out of the world, then later visibly with his saints to judge the world. There is, again, no basis in Scripture for this novel idea. The Bible is emphatic: the return of Jesus will be personal, sudden, public, visible and glorious. -Matthew 24:30-31</p>
<p>“At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the peoples of the earth[a] will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.” “For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.”- 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</p>
<p>The idea of a secret rapture is actually based on a misreading of Matthew 24:40-41 and Luke 17:34-35…Our mandate is to be peacemakers not widow makers (Matthew 5:3-10). We are ‘God’s co-workers’ entrusted as ambassadors with a ministry of reconciliation not speculation (2 Corinthians 5:11-6:2)…###</p></blockquote>
<p>A recent Zogby International poll found that 31% of those surveyed in the national poll strongly believe or somewhat believe in the ideas behind Christian Zionism, defined as “the belief that Jews must have all of the promised land, including all of Jerusalem, to facilitate the second coming of the messiah.”</p>
<p>A CNN/Time poll showed that 59% of the American public believes the prophecies contained in the Book of Revelation will come true.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is an extremist Christian fundamentalist movement which supports the claims of those who believe that the State of Israel should take control of all of the land currently disputed between Palestinians and Israelis and views the creation and expansion of the modern state of Israel as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy toward the second coming of Jesus.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is a two hundred year old theological and political movement that embraces the most extreme ideological positions of Zionism, thereby becoming detrimental to a just peace within Palestine and Israel.</p>
<p>The Christian Zionist program provides a worldview where the Gospel is identified with the ideology of empire, colonialism and militarism. In its extreme form, it laces an emphasis on apocalyptic events leading to the end of history rather than living Christ’s love and justice today.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is also an escapist theology and a match made in hell for neo-con ideology.</p>
<p>These Christians believe that God fights on the side of Israel and they call for unqualified support for the most extreme right wing political positions related to the Holy Land. Christian Zionism has significant support within American Protestant fundamentalists, who number between 10 and 20 million. Its reach is broad, by virtue of its favorite themes related to the “End Times” and an Israel-fixated Christian media.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is both a “movement” and a way of interpreting current events. Its focus is on Israel and the Middle East, as much an ideology as a “movement.” Its promoters share many beliefs but are not organized through any one institution.</p>
<p>Throughout history Christians have at times twisted scripture to justify violence: for the Crusades, for Anti-Semitism, and for slavery. Too often the church has been neglected to respond to these biblical distortions and with disastrous results.</p>
<p>Although the Christian Zionists motives are couched in terms of compassion toward the Jewish people based on a literal reading of scripture their political agenda of territorial expansion Zionists has allowed the ongoing injustices against Palestinians.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tikkun is Hebrew for mend, repair and transform the world. Tikkun is also an organization that researched to discover that there are three distinct elements energizing the Christian Zionists:</p>
<p>1. A strong commitment to conservative and ultra-nationalist American politics (so strong, I believe, that if the U.S. were to decide to break with Israel, this part of the Christian Zionist leadership would go along with that and drop its defense of Israeli policies).</p>
<p>2. Dispensationalist religious commitments that lead many of the Christian Zionists to yearn for a cataclysmic “end of history” eschatological war in the Middle East that will precipitate the second coming of Jesus and the Rapture in which all true Christians will go to heaven and all Jews who have not yet converted to Christianity will burn in hell for eternity.</p>
<p>3. A widespread understanding among many Christians that atonement and repentance is needed for 1700 years of murder, rape, and oppression of Jews that was frequently generated by the Church (though, of course, the Evangelicals do not recognize that church as their church). In this category are many Christian Zionists who genuinely feel terrible about what has happened to the Jews and genuinely want to help the Jewish people. Their philo-Semitism is real and sincere.- Rabbi Lerner, TIKKUN Magazine page 9, Nov/Dec. 2007</p></blockquote>
<p>Jews and Christians worship the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but many fail to comprehend that the first mention of Israel is in Genesis 32:22, when Jacob was renamed Israel for having wrestled and struggled with the Divine.</p>
<p>Thus, to claim that the secular ethnocratic state of Israel has a divine right that supersedes the divine rights of the indigenous people of the land, reeks of racism and misses the point of what the Hebrew prophets were always on about:</p>
<p>“What does God require? He has told you o’man! Be just, be merciful, and walk humbly with your Lord.” -Micah 6:8</p>
<p>“My people are fools, they do not know me! They are skilled in doing evil, they know not how to do good.”-Jeremiah 4:22</p>
<p>“From Moses to Jeremiah and Isaiah, the Prophets taught…that the Jewish claim on the land of Israel was totally contingent on the moral and spiritual life of the Jews who lived there, and that the land would, as the Torah tells us, ‘vomit you out’ if people did not live according to the highest moral vision of Torah. Over and over again, the Torah repeated its most frequently stated mitzvah [command]:</p>
<p>“When you enter your land, do not oppress the stranger; the other, the one who is an outsider of your society, the powerless one and then not only ‘you shall love your neighbor as yourself’ but also ‘you shall love the other.’”-Rabbi Lerner, TIKKUN Magazine, page 35, Sept./Oct. 2007</p>
<p>The term Christianity was also not even coined until three decades after Jesus Christ walked the earth.</p>
<p>Until the day of Paul, followers of Jesus were called members of The Way; meaning the way he taught his followers to be!</p>
<p>Christ was never a Christian, but was born and died a Palestinian devout Jew who was a social justice radical revolutionary road warrior that challenged the job security of the Temple authorities by teaching the people they did NOT need to pay the priests for ritual baths or sacrificing livestock to be OK with God; for God already LOVED them just as they were: sinners, poor, diseased, outcasts, widows, orphans, refugees and prisoners all living under a brutal Roman Military Occupation.</p>
<p>What got Jesus crucified was disturbing the status quo of the Roman Occupying Forces, by teaching the subversive concept that Caesar only had power because God allowed it and that God preferred the humble sinner, the poor, diseased, outcasts, widows, orphans, refugees and prisoners all living under Roman Occupation above the elite and arrogant.</p>
<p>The problem is not with Christianity, but that too few who claim to be Christians have actually done what Jesus taught and I spin Jesus’ Manifesto this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>About 2,000 years ago, when Christ was about 33, he hiked up a hill and sat down under an olive tree and began to teach the people;</p>
<p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.”</p>
<p>In other words: it is those who know their own spiritual poverty, their own limitations and ‘sins’ honestly and trust God loves them in spite of themselves who already live in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>How comforted we will all be, when we see, we haven’t got a clue, as to the depth and breadth of pure love and mercy of The Divine Mystery of The Universe.</p>
<p>God’s name in ancient Aramaic is Abba which means Daddy as much as Mommy and He/She: The Lord has said, “My ways are not your ways. My thoughts are not yours.” -Isaiah 55:8</p>
<p>Christ proclaimed more: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.”</p>
<p>The essence of meek is to be patient with ignorance, slow to anger and never hold a grudge. In other words: how comforted you will be when you also know humility; when you know yourself, the good and the bad, for both cut through every human heart.</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, they will be filled.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will be when your greatest desire is to do what “God requires, and he has already told you what that is; BE JUST, BE MERCIFUL and walk humbly with your Lord.”-Micah 6:8</p>
<p>“Blessed are the merciful, they will be shown mercy.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will all be when you choose to return only kindness to your ‘enemy.’</p>
<p>“For with the measure you measure against another, it will be measured back to you” Christ warns his disciples as he explains the law of karma in Luke 6:27-38.</p>
<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they see God.”</p>
<p>In other words: how comforted you will be when you WAKE UP and see God is already within you, within every man, every woman and every child. The Supreme Being is everywhere, the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. Beyond The Universe -and yet so small; within the heart of every atom.</p>
<p>“Blessed are The Peacemakers: THEY shall be called the children of God.”</p>
<p>And what a wonderful world it will be when we all seek peace by pursuing justice; for there can be none without the other.</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires, theirs is The Kingdom of Heaven.”</p>
<p>And one fine day the lion will lie down with The Lamb; meaning man will make war no more and that would create a sisterhood of man which just maybe the Kingdom of God on planet earth.</p></blockquote>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/UK-US-flag3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/UK-US-flag2.jpg" alt="" /></a><em>Fundamentalist and rabid Zionist fire and brimstone preacher John Hagee is taking his ‘mission’ to Birmingham, UK on 18-20 August, “teaching the Book of Revelation” with the “goal” to “reveal the world tomorrow, confirm the total accuracy of Bible prophecy and give you a better understanding of the current crisis America and the world are facing.” </em>[1]</p>
<p>Hagee and his ‘disciples’ should begin at the very end of the book of Revelation which “warns everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them. God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life.”-Rev. 22:18-19</p>
<p>The Book of the Revelation of Saint John the Divine, who written during the time John was was exiled to Patmos in the Aegean archipelago during the reign of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domitian" target="_blank">Domitian</a>, at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>No one knows what John was burning as incense or how much wine he consumed when he wrote this piece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_literature">apocalyptic literature</a> which is “marked by distinctive literary features, particularly prediction of future events and accounts of visionary experiences or journeys to heaven, often involving vivid symbolism.”</p>
<p>John’s poem, dreams and visions were written for the people of his day and it was his way to confront the Roman Occupying Forces.</p>
<p>In his Letter from Birmingham Jail,  Reverend Martin Luther King,  Jr. directly challenged his “fellow clergymen” and the willfully ignorant “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.</p>
<p>“There are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.</p>
<p>“I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.</p>
<p>“Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>
<p>“Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever and if repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history.”</p>
<p>For the many who take the Bible literally I wonder why they do not take Jesus more seriously, for he warned it is the Peacemakers who are the children of God-not those that bomb, torture or occupy others and do NOT judge others.</p>
<p>“John Hagee believes the Holocaust was part of God’s plan to force Jews to return to Israel…He compared Adolf Hitler in one sermon to a ‘hunter’ sent by God to force Jews to live in Israel and said the Koran gave Muslims ‘a scriptural mandate to kill Christians and Jews’.</p>
<p>“He also claimed that 200 million Muslims were ready to commit violence against the US and Israel. In the same interview he claimed Hurricane Katrina, which killed 1,800 people in 2005, was ‘the judgment of God against New Orleans’ because of a planned ‘homosexual parade’.” [2]</p>
<p>On 6 November 2007, I attended a CUFI/Christians United for Israel event at the James L. Knight Center in Miami, which was packed to the rafters with Hagee’s tribe of Christian Zionists and south Florida’s right wing Jewish community.</p>
<p>Zion’s Fire Banners, dancers, singers and a band whipped the crowd into a frenzy of spinning, jumping, clapping, twirling and moved the rotund Hagee to link arms with men in skull caps and dance the Hora-not to Hava Nagila, but to repeated choruses of:</p>
<p>Shout for joy and victory! Bat Yerushalyim</p>
<p>From one end of the stage to the other, the largest American and Israeli flags I have ever seen were draped side by side and by the end of the evening I imagined every star on the red-white-and blue had morphed into the Star of David.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade County Commissioner Joe Martinez pointed to the flags and exclaimed: “Isn’t that beautiful up there together? I get goose bumps! All nations have been created by an act of man, except Israel was created by an act of God.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Freedman delivered the Invocation, “We are all friends of the only democracy in the Middle East.”</p>
<p>I immediately recalled what American Israeli, Jeff Halper, the Founder and Coordinator of ICAHD/Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions told me during one of my five journeys to Jerusalem:</p>
<p>“Israel is a not a democracy but is an Ethnocracy, meaning a country run and controlled by a national group with some democratic elements but set up with Jews in control and structured to keep them in control.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Freedman continued on, “From Mount Sinai to Mount Zion to Mount Vernon we are all Zionists! Israel is second to America in how many immigrants we have absorbed.”</p>
<p>Immigrant absorption in Israel comes with perks and is called Aliyah, ["go up"] and is a fundamental concept of Zionism enshrined in Israel’s Law of Return, which permits any Jew from any where in the world the legal right to government assisted immigration and settlement in Israel, automatic Israeli citizenship, unemployment benefits, free medical, and subsidized housing. Young adult immigrants receive free room, utilities, and three meals a day for the first five months and 100 percent of their tuition is paid by the government.</p>
<p>Hagee’s mastery of manipulating the fears of his audience garnered him a standing ovation as the shofars blew, “Israel was re-born by an act of God and Israel lives! The Jews have suffered great persecution and survived slavery and the Final Solution! God Jehovah will bury Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran! The flag of Israel will fly over the undivided Jerusalem and be the praise of all the earth! It’s 1938 again and the new Hitler is Ahmadinejad! Radical Islamisicts are threatening to develop nuclear weapons in order to destroy Israel and then the USA! But we are indivisible and we are both here forever!”</p>
<p>However, “In his October 2005 speech, Mr. Ahmadinejad never used the word “map” or the term “wiped off”. According to Farsi-language experts like Juan Cole and even right-wing services like MEMRI, what he actually said was “this regime that is occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time.”</p>
<p>“In this speech to an annual anti-Zionist conference, Mr. Ahmadinejad was being prophetic, not threatening. He was citing Imam Khomeini, who said this line in the 1980s (a period when Israel was actually selling arms to Iran, so apparently it was not viewed as so ghastly then). Mr. Ahmadinejad had just reminded his audience that the Shah’s regime, the Soviet Union, and Saddam Hussein had all seemed enormously powerful and immovable, yet the first two had vanished almost beyond recall and the third now languished in prison. So, too, the “occupying regime” in Jerusalem would someday be gone. His message was, in essence, “This too shall pass.” [3]</p>
<p><strong>Tikkun is Hebrew for mend, repair and transform the world.</strong></p>
<p>Tikkun is also an organization and magazine that researched to discover three distinct elements that energize Christian Zionists:</p>
<p>1. A strong commitment to conservative and ultra-nationalist American politics (so strong, I believe, that if the U.S. were to decide to break with Israel, this part of the Christian Zionist leadership would go along with that and drop its defense of Israeli policies).</p>
<p>2. Dispensationalist religious commitments that lead many of the Christian Zionists to yearn for a cataclysmic “end of history” eschatological war in the Middle East that will precipitate the second coming of Jesus and the Rapture in which all true Christians will go to heaven and all Jews who have not yet converted to Christianity will burn in hell for eternity.</p>
<p>3. A widespread understanding among many Christians that atonement and repentance is needed for 1700 years of murder, rape, and oppression of Jews that was frequently generated by the Church (though, of course, the Evangelicals do not recognize that church as their church). In this category are many Christian Zionists who genuinely feel terrible about what has happened to the Jews and genuinely want to help the Jewish people. Their philo-Semitism is real and sincere.</p>
<p>But in Miami that night, multitudes of misled and misinformed Christian’s celebrated military occupation, violence, power and control and ignored the gospel Jesus preached: “It is the peacemakers who shall be called the children of God.” –Matthew 5:9</p>
<p>Hagee repeatedly cited that all worship the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but neglected to mention that the first mention of Israel is in Genesis 32:22, when Jacob was renamed Israel for having wrestled and struggled with the Divine.</p>
<p>Hagee threw out the names of all the Hebrew prophets, but not the fact that God raised up prophets to speak truth to power and arrogance and to remind people of what God desires:</p>
<p>“What does God require? He has told you o’man! Be just, be merciful, and walk humbly with your Lord.” -Micah 6:8</p>
<p>God raised up prophets to admonish the “stiff necked people” [Exodus 34:9, Proverbs 29:1] because “My people are fools, they do not know me! They are skilled in doing evil, they know not how to do good.”-Jeremiah 4:22</p>
<p>Hagee invoked the “Torah Way” but neglected what the Torah commands:</p>
<p>“From Moses to Jeremiah and Isaiah, the Prophets taught…that the Jewish claim on the land of Israel was totally contingent on the moral and spiritual life of the Jews who lived there, and that the land would, as the Torah tells us, ‘vomit you out’ if people did not live according to the highest moral vision of Torah. Over and over again, the Torah repeated its most frequently stated mitzvah [command]:</p>

<p>“When you enter your land, do not oppress the stranger; the other, the one who is an outsider of your society, the powerless one and then not only ‘you shall love your neighbor as yourself’ but also ‘you shall love the other.’”</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/unholyalliance2.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/unholyalliance2.jpg" alt="" /></a>There’s an old saying, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions,” meaning that people who believe they are doing good often end up doing evil.  It’s the law of unintended consequences.  Unfortunately this is what has happened to some&#8211;not all&#8211;religious conservative organizations.   I know of altruistic Christian activists, both conservative and liberal, who believe they are doing God’s work, but in their effort to “right wrongs” they have utterly failed to honor God’s command to “earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. “ (Jude 1:3)</p>
<p>What does Jude mean?  Simply that <em>true</em> followers of Jesus Christ are first and foremost to share Christ with the lost.   Yet many so-called Christians are not evangelizing the lost for fear of being perceived as trying to “push their religion on others.”  They detest being thought of as intolerant, thus they remain silent.  <em>News flash</em>:  The Gospel of Jesus Christ always has been and always will be offensive to those who are lost!  It’s a whole lot easier to say “Jesus loves you” than “take up your cross and follow Him.”</p>
<p>Some prominent Christian Right (CR) leaders that head up ginormous organizations are so busy fighting the culture war that they’ve forgotten what’s most important &#8212; Truth!  Jesus said: &#8220;Thy Word is truth!&#8221; (John 17:17)</p>
<p>The CR (unrepentantly) unites with pretty much anyone who is likeminded politically. Sadly this includes a slew of false teachers, cultists, and <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/110318" target="_blank">Social Justice Christians</a> (SJC) a.k.a. Progressive Evangelicals.  SJCs are chiefly liberals whose main goal is to dismantle historical, orthodox Christianity and usher in a “new kind of Christianity.”  In the name of social justice, SJC leaders stealthly steer undiscerning believers into a left-wing collectivized utopia!</p>
<p>SJC is beyond of the scope of this article so I’ll move on.</p>
<p>PRAGMATISM = COMPROMISE</p>
<p>Many in the CR leadership are uniting with evil doers (God’s word, not mine). They have climbed aboard the SS Pragmatism and are proceeding full speed ahead into shark infested waters. Uniting with evil doers serves two specific purposes.   It helps get the message out and provides an additional source of revenue.  And let’s face it.  When the money stops rolling in organizations are forced to close their doors.  So these additional funds, regardless of the source, keep the message alive and the group afloat.</p>
<p>Before I move to my next point I need to stress that it is my belief that Christians should try to influence public policy.  How?  By casting their vote, serving in local government, forming and joining special interest groups, writing letters to the Editor, giving financial support, and participating in lawful demonstrations. Anti-abortion activists are a good example of Christians trying to influence public policy.  Pro-lifers have formed groups comprised mostly of Christians that engage in politics because it is the only means they have to end abortion.  If Roe v. Wade is overturned, it will happen because of the dogged determination of political action groups.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons Christians should <em>never </em>relinquish control of the government to godless secular humanists and “grievous wolves” (Acts 20:29)!  On the other hand, Christ never commanded His followers to build a theocracy!</p>
<p>Isn’t the NAR’s attempting to do this?</p>
<p>A SUBTLE SHIFT</p>
<p>P. J. Miller urges visitors to Sola Dei Gloria to read an essay by Rachel Tabachnic titled <a href="http://pjmiller.wordpress.com/2008/09/24/the-subtle-advance-of-the-apostolic-revolution-and-joels-army/" target="_blank">Lions In the Pews</a>. “This is an extremely interesting article,” says Miller, “one I would suggest reading in its entirety. You may not agree with all of it, (the author touches on the rapture and a few other points which many believers differ over, theologically) but sitting that aside, the information concerning the subtle shift many Churches are making into Dominionist/Dominionism theology is excellent reading for those interested in the goals these people have set and are pursuing: That includes the NAR…”  (Bold added by P. J.)</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from Tabachnic’s article with bold by P. J.:</p>
<p><em>But this strand has emerged from Pentecostal and Charismatic backgrounds and has been nearly invisible to both the mainstream press and progressive writers. Like other Dominionists the New Apostolics are culture warriors and have specific stated goals for overtaking all spheres of American society and government as seen in the video above.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Also, like other dominionist groups they actually invest much of their efforts in fighting the traditional institutionalized church.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>However, they differ from most other Dominionist groups in their embrace of the outpouring of gifts of the holy spirit, or manifestations, like being slain in the spirit, Holy Laughter, and other states of altered consciousness that are a part of their very experiential worship style.</em></p>
<p><em>The New Apostolic Reformation is also much more focused on the expulsion of demons as the process for healing, social reform, or even raising people from the dead.  They have a unique and extensive lingo that is dedicated to the description of the expulsion of territorial demons including terms like ground level spiritual warfare, occult level spiritual warfare, and strategic level spiritual warfare.</em></p>
<p><em>While Pentecostal churches have always celebrated a restoration of the church, this has been tempered with Rapture theology.   <strong>As churches embrace this Apostolic revolution they are moving away from the traditions of Assemblies of God and other denominations</strong> and  are adopting a  view of the end time that includes the triumph and perfection of the church as opposed to escaping  in the Rapture from an evil world descending into the apocalypse.</em></p>
<p><em>They see the imminent end times as a time of great glory for <strong>the restored true  Apostolic church</strong> greater than the one of New Testament times, and a time when the foot soldiers of this church<strong> will be imparted with supernatural powers</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>This outpouring of powers will allow them to crush evil with a <strong>“rod of iron”</strong> and deliver a purified church to Jesus when he returns.</em></p>
<p>Seeing as pro-family leaders <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-acB877SGVs" target="_blank">Tony Perkins</a>, <a href="http://theresponseusa.com/leadership.php" target="_blank">Don Wildmon</a>, <a href="http://pjmiller.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/janet-porter-dropped-from-vcy-for-dominion-theology/" target="_blank">Janet Porter</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2KecGvomHY" target="_blank">Mat Staver</a> have united with the NAR one can’t help but wonder if they share their end times beliefs.  It’s a legitimate question to ask.</p>
<p>PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT</p>
<p>Methodist holiness preacher <a href="http://www.tribwatch.com/parham.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Charles Parham</span></a> is considered the founder of modern Pentecostalism. Parham broke with the Methodist church and started his own ministry. In 1901Agnes Ozman began to speak in &#8220;tongues&#8221; when hands were laid on her. Parham believed that speaking in tongues was both a sign of Spirit baptism and also the signal of the end of the age. Parham also linked the Baptism of the Holy Spirit with a latter-day Pentecost.</p>
<p>“What began on a corner at the turn of the twentieth century is now barreling down Main Street. What was once known as the<a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/pente.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pentecostal movement</span></a> has now splintered into numerous diverse, yet overlapping movements: <a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/abrief.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Pentecostal</span></a>, <a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Charismatic</span></a>, <a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/vine/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Vineyard</span></a>,<a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/char/more/w-f.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Word-Faith</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/holylaugh.htm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Holy Laughter</span></a>.” (1)</p>
<p>Add to the list Latter Rain Restorationism/ International House of Prayer (IHOP)/Third Wave/Deliverance/ Soaking in the Spirit/ and the <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/110610" target="_blank">aforementioned</a> Dominionists/ Seven Mountains/Elijah Revolution/Kingdom Now/Joel’s Army/Manifest Sons of God and most recently the NAR.  I’ve only scratched the surface!</p>
<p>Bud Press of <a href="http://christianresearchservice.com/The_Prophetic_Movement.htm" target="_blank">Christian Research Service</a> lamented:</p>
<p><em>The Prophetic Movement is a dark, evil wasteland teeming with false apostles, false prophets, hyper-heretics, false healers, and greedy, money-hungry con men and women, all of whom are overshadowed by Satan and his demonic forces.</em></p>
<p>There’s plenty of blame to go around for the unholy mess the Church has become.   Liberals, liars, and loons have infiltrated her.  To paraphrase my pastor’s teaching (from my notes), believers have been misled by well-spoken, self-promoting, self-serving, charismatic leaders who emphasize power gifts but put little emphasis on preaching the gospel.   These men and women think nothing of exploiting God’s people for their own gain.</p>
<p>Jesus gave us fair warning:</p>
<p><em>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</em> (Mat 7:15-17)</p>
<p>While we’re on the subject of ravening wolves, some false teachers deny the divinity of Jesus Christ…</p>
<p>There was no bodily resurrection…</p>
<p>The Bible was written by men, not by Divine inspiration.   It’s a book of myths and fables, full of contradictions, open to interpretation, holds hidden meanings that only the “enlightened” can know…</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Wolves teach that God loves, doesn’t judge, so all humans go to heaven.</p>
<p>Triniterianism is out…</p>
<p>No vicarious Atonement…</p>
<p>The virgin birth?  Don’t make me laugh!&#8230;</p>
<p>As for sodomy? No sin there!&#8230;</p>
<p>Fornication and cohabitation? What’s the big deal?&#8230;</p>
<p>Abortion?  It’s my choice!&#8230;</p>
<p>Wait a minute!  A Christian can <em>choose</em> to murder a baby?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I could go on, but hopefully the point is made. The postmodern Church will only tolerate a small “g” god who simply rolls his/her eyes at sin and say, “Boys will be boys.”</p>
<p>Over 20 years ago the late Dr. Walter Martin took on liberalism in the Church:</p>
<p><em>Let me tell you something that I have learned; I know the liberals. I know them well; I was one of them. And they are the most dangerous, insidious, and all-pervading cult that’s loose in the United States right at this moment…</em></p>
<p><em>And this theological flea infestation is ruining the lifeblood of the Church, which is evangelism. And, you think these are very strong statements; I intend to back them up in—if necessary—excruciating details. For any person who does not know that today in the United States, and in denominational structures world-around, we are in an accelerating apostasy does not know—I repeat—does not know what’s going on…</em></p>
<p><em>We have, for more than one hundred years, been under sustained attack in the United States; in our theological seminaries, church related schools, and our churches. A sustained attack by people, who have the form of godliness, and work within the structure of the Church and have—wherever they have been permitted the opportunity—diluted the Gospel and destroyed the Faith.</em></p>
<p><em>They occupy today the chairs in our major theological seminaries; the rulership of our major denominational structures—they maintain boldly and boastfully—“This[is] the Church!” But it’s not the Church if it denies the power of the Gospel&#8230; </em>(2)</p>
<p>LYING SIGNS &amp; WONDERS</p>
<p>The NAR travels the globe allegedly performing miraculous healings, raising the dead back to life and breaking down “demonic strongholds.”  They have visions as clear as a movie screen… give future prophecies…experience visitations from Jesus, angels, and Aimee Simple McPherson.  As an extra added bonus they get “revelation knowledge” directly from God and have the unmitigated arrogance to say, “The Spirit of God spoke to me…” but there’s no way to verify whose voice they hear!  According to Isaiah 8:20, “[I]f they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them.”</p>
<p>With all the powers these wolves possess, I presume some of them can walk on water.</p>
<p>WE’RE STILL WAITING, RICK</p>
<p>In 1988 “super-prophet” Rick Joyner shared his “vision” concerning the coming “revolution” in the Church:</p>
<p><em>“What is about to come upon the earth is not just a revival, or another awakening; it is a veritable revolution. The vision was given in order to begin to awaken those who are destined to radically change the course, and even the very definition of Christianity. The dismantling of organizations and disbanding of some works will be a positive and exhilarating experience for the Lord’s faithful servants. A great company of prophets, teachers, pastors and apostles will be raised up with the spirit of Phineas; it will be said of the apostles soon to be anointed that they have turned an upside down world right side up. Nations will tremble at the mention of their name.”</em> (3)</p>
<p>Have I missed something?  I can’t think of a single nation that trembles at the name of Rick Joyner or the other so-called apostles and prophets.  Joyner’s alleged prophecy came to him over two decades ago. He claimed that the “soon to be” anointed would turn an upside world right side up. Well, what’s the hold up? With the way things are going in this country, I’m eager for the “great company” to turn things right side up, aren’t you?</p>
<p>A CALL TO DISCERNMENT</p>
<p>Admittedly there are some CR leaders that want to build a theocracy as do Dominionists, but many in the CR do not.  The CR leadership unfamiliar with the NAR’s global goals is leading those involved in fighting the culture war into shark infested waters.  They must “take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them (evil men).” (Deut. 12:30)  In other words, listen up &#8212; and abandon ship!</p>
<p><em>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</em> (2 Cor. 11:13, 14)</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/christiansprey2.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/christiansprey2.jpg" alt="" /></a>There is a time coming when we will be forced to determine what constitutes a problem and what constitutes a solution – for those who are not Christaphobes we might call it separating the sheep from the goats.  There are a lot of goats!  With all the turmoil in the world we have not heard much from the <a href="http://www.cpusa.org/contact/">Communist Party</a> but it is still there and when the turmoil reaches an apogee it will be well organized and ready to take charge.  Already people are taking to the streets in demonstrations; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBAZkzFxBE&amp;feature=related">here</a> and throughout the <a href="http://www.fotosearch.com/photos-images/political-demonstration.html">world</a>. Domestic demonstrations are contagious so our media does not report them.</p>
<p>Attempts to destabilize America have been going on for a long time.  Revolutions produce chaos and chaos provides an opportunity to install new governments. There are many organizations and groups seeking power; some present a real threat.  The Communist Party is ready, able and a world-wide danger; Zionism is a similar threat.  The New World order and its United Nations arm are eager and ready.  Standing armies have always been a threat.  China and Russia are powerful nations ready to stand on top of the pyramid.  Libertarians and Anarchists have ideological agendas, and Mexicans are waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Over the past several decades law enforcement in the United States has increased its use of force and its demand for undeserved “respect”.  Lack of concern for justice and robotic enforcement of the law (often bad law) fosters widespread public resentment at a time when chaos is imminent and a respected, efficient police force is sorely needed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Christian Church has forsaken God and pursued a humanistic political solution to a religious problem. It has taken an untenable position; complaining loudly about abortion and homosexuality while steadfastly denying the basis for forbidding these practices.  Christians do not understand that law forms the religious base of society and it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God while obeying the laws of a <a href="http://rgeorgedunn.blogspot.com/2011/06/townhall-spotlight-congress-to-mandate.html">secular government</a>.</p>
<p>In the current issue of the SCP Journal (<a href="http://www.scp-inc.org/">Spiritual Counterfeits Project</a>)  Lee Penn has written an interesting article entitled “Anti-Christs and False Messiahs Down the Ages”.</p>
<p>Penn believes that “within the Catholic and Protestant churches, there are movements and habits of thought that may predispose many people to heed the Deceiver when he stages a falsified “Second Coming of Christ.”  He believes that both Catholics and Protestants “have similar dreams of establishing a national – or global – Christian regime before the end of the age.  Included with those that might produce a “false Christ” is much maligned Christian Reconstruction, one of the few sheep in a sea of goats.</p>
<p>Sans some essential pieces, the objectives of Christian Reconstruction are fairly well outlined.  Penn uses the phrase “Old Testament Law” as a derogatory term and informs his readers that Reconstructionists seek to Christianize the world and set up a theocracy before the Return of Christ.   He describes this quest as a “dream of an orderly, righteous, religious utopia”.</p>
<p>Penn is rejecting a sheep and siding with a goat.</p>
<p>After tracing the Biblical description of times that will precede the Second Coming, he fails to note that this description has resulted in the imminent anticipation of Jesus’ return repeatedly from the New Testament era to the present.  He also fails to mention that Jesus said that He, Himself, did not know the day or time, nor did the Angels. (Matthew 24:36)  That statement should be enough to stop the embarrassment, contention, and massive waste of time and energy numerous theories about this event have created.  The day and time should be left in the Hands of God (where it belongs) and we should fight the battle and do the work assigned to us.</p>
<p>Penn has fallen into the disastrous trap of “occupying” until Jesus comes again.  He seems to believe that “occupy” is a Pietistic term that means biding an indeterminate amount of time with navel gazing (introspection and self evaluation), repentance, prayer for our enemies, humility, and spiritual acuity.  There is nothing specifically wrong with any of this but it is a truncated directive that immobilizes the Body of Christ and allows the forces of evil full sway.</p>
<p>Jesus directed us to take the Gospel into all the world.  Evangelism is close to God’s Heart and an essential part of the Christian religion.  It is, however, not the most important part; that is obedience.  From Genesis to Revelation God seeks an obedient people. The Bible describes the character of God.  He changes His mind but not His character.  When God gave the Law to Moses He gave His people directions on how they were to behave to bring lasting righteousness, peace, and prosperity.  For those who do not heed His Commandments He promised immorality, strife, and poverty.  The Law is a reflection of God’s character and a perennial guide for proper behavior.</p>
<p>There are several problems with Lee Penn’s theology:  1) He has fallen into the trap of assuming the Second Coming is imminent.  This assumption plays into the hands of God’s enemies by paralyzing His warriors.  The day and time of the Second Coming will be determined by God.  It is not our concern!   2) He believes the quest for order and righteousness is a “Utopian” “dream” and seems willing to allow evil forces to overcome Christianity while he waits to be raptured.  3)  He advises us to “occupy” and joins the do nothing but wait body of Christian fig trees that Christ specifically condemned. 4) His antinomian position fails to provide a structure for obedience.  5) Mr. Penn concludes that false Christs are a spiritual problem when the Bible identifies them as an obedience problem.  False prophets are to be executed and if we really believed in the God we pretend to worship we would agree with that punishment.</p>
<p>Immorality is progressing quickly, violence is increasing by leaps and bounds, and poverty is apparent everywhere.  These are the punishments God promised to those who disobeyed His Commandments.  Professing Christians do what is right in their own eyes and all of us are subject to the immoral laws our government has legally placed upon us.  Spirituality is not an antidote to behavioral sin.  The only antidote is repentance and obedience.  God has not changed.  His standards for behavior have not changed.  His Son has provided forgiveness for our sins but that has not changed His expectations. In the New Covenant Christians are His chosen people.  He expects us to be obedient</p>
<p>Christian Reconstructionists do not intend to impose God’s Law on a secular society.  We believe an ever increasing number of Christians will assent to obey God’s Laws and eventually an obedient world will result.  We are a tiny group but God showed His preference for tiny groups by reducing Gideon’s men to 300. (Judges 7)</p>
<p>Penn advises us to examine ourselves and repent of our sin.  He advises us to end our participation in evil and deception.  It is good advice but Penn does not specify exactly what constitutes “sin”, “evil”, and “deception”.  Pietism always leaves the door open for humanism by failing to provide God’s specific direction.</p>
<p>Sin is disobedience to God’s Law.  If we are ever to regain God’s blessing we must become obedient.</p>
<p>Penn chides Reconstruction’s intention to return God’s creation to His control by obeying His Laws.  He is a pragmatist who believes Christians cannot be successful in transforming entire social structures.  As he reproaches the full orbed theology of Christian Reconstruction he fails to note that Islam is growing faster than Christianity and according to one of their <a href="http://www.allaahuakbar.net/womens/islam.htm">websites</a> it is because “Islam is a complete way of life. It tells man about the purpose of his creation and existence, his ultimate destiny, his place among other creatures and more importantly, it provides him with guidance to lead a balanced and purposeful life which will enable him to avoid the Hell-fire and be rewarded with a place in Paradise in the life after death.”</p>
<p>Penn is a smart guy; a Phi Beta Kappa who graduated cum laude from Harvard.  His research and writing are above reproach but he leaves Christians in the same useless quagmire they have occupied since they allowed foreign theologies to dominate their religion more than two centuries ago.</p>
<p>Sheep obey their Master’s voice, goats do not.</p>
