<p>The erotic reliefs of Hindu temples with their gravity-defying and anatomy-challenging positions have found a new modern competitor in the Ukrainian crisis. Each party wants to get the Jews on their side, while claiming that the other side is anti-Jewish <strong>and</strong> a Jewish puppet at once. This impossible, Kama-Sutraesque position is the result of extremely confusing alliances: the Kiev regime lists devout Jews and fiery antisemites among its mainstays. The leading figures of the regime (including the president-elect) are of Jewish origin; strongman and chief financier Mr. Igor (Benya) Kolomoysky is a prominent Jewish public figure, the builder of many synagogues and a supporter of Israel. The most derring-do and pro-active force of the regime, the ultra-nationalists of the Svoboda party and the Right Sector, admire Hitler and his Ukrainian Quisling, Stepan Bandera, “liberators of Ukraine from the Judeo-Muscovite yoke”. Jews are ambivalent, and the sides are ambivalent about them, and a most entertaining intrigue has been hatched.</p>
<p>The Russians tried to pull Israel and American Jews to their side, with little success. President Putin condemned the antisemitism of the Svoboda party; he mentioned the desecration of the Odessa Jewish cemetery in his important talk. The Russians re-vitalised the World War Two narrative, fully identifying the Kiev regime with the Bandera gangs and the Nazi enemy. Still, this rhetoric is not taken seriously by Jews who refuse to feel threatened by cuddly Kolomoysky. “These Nazis are not against Jews, they are against Russians, so it is not a Jewish problem”, they say.</p>
<p>The Kiev regime mirrored the Russian attitude, if not Russia&#8217;s tactics. Being rather short of facts to brandish, they faked a leaflet from Donetsk rebels to local Jews calling upon them to register and pay a special poll tax “for the Jews support the Kiev regime”. This rude and improbable hoax was immediately and convincingly disproved, but not before it was used by, no less, Barak Obama and John Kerry. The American Jewish newspaper of record, The <a href="http://forward.com/articles/196864/the-real-truth-about-those-anti-semitic-flyers-in/">Forward</a>, obfuscated the issue by saying that Russians and Ukrainians are antisemites by birth and their denials are to be taken with a grain of salt. This mud-slinging was effective – the hoax has made the front pages, while its debunking was published on the back pages.</p>
<p>The Russians had the facts on their side, and the West knew that: the US <a href="http://www.jta.org/2013/06/27/news-opinion/world/ultranationalist-ukrainian-political-party-leaders-banned-from-u-s">refused entry</a> to Oleg Tyagnibok and other Svoboda leaders (now members of Kiev government) because of their antisemitism as recently as in 2013. But Russian appeals to Jewish and American sensitivities failed to make an impact. They know when to feign indignation and when to hush. Pro-Hitler commemorations are frequent in Estonia, Latvia, Croatia, and cause no lifting of a censorious brow, for these countries are solidly anti-Russian. In March of this year, the Obama administration’s special envoy on anti-Semitism, Ira Forman, <a href="http://www.jta.org/2014/03/13/news-opinion/world/u-s-envoy-ira-forman-russian-claims-on-anti-semitism-in-ukraine-baseless">flatly denied</a> everything and said to the <em>Forward</em> that Putin’s assertions of Svoboda’s antisemitism “were not credible”. The US wants to decide who is an antisemite and who is not; like Hermann Goering wanted to decide who is a Jew and who is not in the Luftwaffe. In the Ukrainian crisis, the Jews remain divided, and follow their countries’ preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Israel is neutral</strong></p>
<p>Recently Prime Minister Netanyahu called President Putin. Putin is always available for and always courteous to Netanyahu, as opposed to President Obama, who shows signs of irritation. (Admittedly Obama has to listen to Netanyahu much more often and for hours.) Netanyahu apologised that he wouldn’t be able to come to St Petersburg for Israeli Culture Week; instead, old reliable Shimon Peres, Israel&#8217;s President, will make the trip. He apologised for leaking the news of this visit cancellation to the media, as well.</p>
<p>This is quite typical for the Israeli PM: at first, he asks for an invitation, Russia extends it, then he cancels his visit and leaks it to the press, thus earning brownie points with the Americans. He did it at the Sochi Olympic games, and now again, in St Petersburg. This is his way of expressing Israeli neutrality.</p>
<p>Israel is explicitly neutral in the Ukrainian crisis. Israelis walked out and did not vote on the UN GA Crimea resolution at all, annoying its American sponsors. The Israelis had a flimsy excuse: their Foreign Office was on strike. The Americans weren’t satisfied with this explanation. Strike or not, vote you must!</p>
<p>We learned from our Israeli colleagues the details of the Putin-Netanyahu phone conversation, which elaborated the reasons for Israeli neutrality. Israel is worried that as an asymmetric response to the US sanctions, Russia would deliver its potent air defence systems to Iran and Syria. Iran and Russia had signed a weapons supply contract a few years ago, Iran duly paid; then the shipment was suspended. Iran went to court demanding a massive compensation for the breach of contract. Likewise, the Syrians were supposed to get the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, able to protect its skies from Israeli raids. The deliveries commenced; PM Netanyahu beseeched Putin to put it on hold. Initially Putin objected, stressing the defensive nature of the system. Netanyahu told the Russian president that the S-300 would allow the Syrians to cover the whole North of Israel, at least all the way to Haifa, rendering important airfields unusable and endangering civil aviation as well. Putin agreed to stop the deliveries.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin is friendly to Israel. He promised he would not allow the destruction of Israel; he promised to save its population if the situation should become truly dangerous. During the recent visit of PM Netanyahu to Moscow, Putin was not carried away by Netanyahu and Liberman’s hints of possible Israeli re-alliance with Moscow instead of Washington. He told the Israelis that their ties with the US are too strong for such a re-alliance being conceivable. Putin said that Russia is satisfied with the present level of friendship and does not demand that Tel Aviv weaken its ties with Washington. Putin visited Israel a few times, he received the Israeli PM in Kremlin. The Israeli ambassador Mme Golender sees Putin more often than do her American or French counterparts.</p>
<p>This friendly attitude has a down-to-earth reason: Putin is not fluent in English or French, while Mme Ambassador speaks Russian to him, eliminating the bothersome need of an interpreter. A deeper reason is Putin’s background: a scion of liberal elites, brought up in St Petersburg, schooled by ultra-liberal Mayor Sobchack, anointed by Boris Yeltsin, Putin is naturally friendly to Jews and to Israel. This friendly attitude annoyed some Russian ultra-patriots, who excitedly circulated his photo taken in the obligatory <em>kippah</em>near the Wailing Wall. They also counted and recounted the names of Jewish oligarchs in Moscow.</p>
<p>True, some of them – Berezovsky, Gusinsky, Hodorkovsky &#8211; had to flee their Russian homeland, but the Russian president is surely not the Jewish-tycoons-Nemesis and the-new-Hitler he is sometimes made out to be. Abramovich and Friedman, to name just two, retain his trust and access. Putin does not mind any oligarch (Jewish or Gentile) – as long as he stays out of politics.</p>
<p>Putin is also friendly with Jewish intellectuals and gentlemen-of-the-media, even if they are outright hostile to him. Masha Gessen, Jewish Lesbian Putin-hater and magazine editor; Alexey Venediktov, Jewish chief editor of <em>Echo Moskvy</em>, a popular liberal medium that attacks Putin every day; many others enjoy access to Putin, &#8211; while no Russian nationalist including Dr Alexander Dugin can boast of having met with the president privately.</p>
<p>Putin’s affability does not turn him into a bountiful source for every Jewish initiative. He stopped S-300 deliveries to Iran, but rejected all Israeli overtures asking him to ditch Iran, or Syria, or Hamas. In the course of their last phone conversation, Netanyahu claimed the Israelis discovered proofs of Iranian nukes. Putin politely expressed his doubts and re-addressed him to IAEA. He agreed to receive the Israeli “experts” with their proofs in Moscow, but nothing came of it. Russia’s support for Palestine is unwavering, – there is a Palestinian embassy in Moscow, too.</p>
<p>Putin supported building of a spacious Jewish museum in Moscow and personally contributed to its budget – but Russian street advertising proclaims the Resurrection of Christ, Eastertide, and His Nativity at Christmas. No “season&#8217;s greetings”, but open affirmation of Christianity. Russia is not like the US or EU, where external signs of Christian faith are forbidden, Easter and Christmas can’t be mentioned and whatever Jews request must be done immediately. Western Jews are annoyed (so their organisations claim) by public displays of Christian faith, but Russian Jews do not mind; moreover, they intermarry, convert and enter the Church in previously unheard of numbers. They are not strongly pro-Israeli, those that were already left for Israel.</p>
<p>So the Jews of Russia are not an influential factor to the Russian President. Putin will do what is right according to the Christian faith, and what is good for Russia, as he understands it &#8212; and he can’t be convinced to give up really important points. Other considerations – such as friendship with Israel – would normally take a much lower place in his priorities. However, in the midst of the Ukrainian crisis, as the Russians are worried by sanctions and by threats of isolation, they try to pull Jews to their side. This makes them increasingly susceptible to Israeli manipulation, whether state-authorised or a private venture.</p>
<p>Last week, Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld visited Moscow. In 2003, he famously threatened Europe with nuclear destruction (the “Samson Option”), saying “Israel has the capability to take the world down with us, and that will happen before Israel goes under”. Now he has explained to Russians Israel’s new policy: While the US enters the period of its decline, Israel must diversify and hedge its bets by drawing close to Moscow, Beijing and Delhi, he wrote in <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/571903">Izvestia</a> daily. Perhaps, but without going too far. A flirt – yes, switching sides – not yet.</p>
<p>Israel prefers to stick to its neutrality. This is easy, as the Israeli populace (excepting its Russians) is not interested in Russian/Ukrainian affairs, does not know the difference between Russia and the Ukraine and is rather unfriendly to Russians/Ukrainians. This goes for both the Left and Right; the Israeli Left is even more pro-American than the Israeli Right. As for Russian Israelis, they are equally divided between supporters of Russia and supporters of Kiev regime. While observing niceties towards Russia, Israel does not intend to side with Moscow. The Jewish oligarchs of Ukraine – Kolomoysky, Pinchuk, Rabinovich – are integrated within the Kiev regime, <strong>and</strong> they support Israeli right-wing on a large scale. Israeli businessmen are invested in the Ukraine, and the oligarchs are invested in Israel. Kolomoysky controls YuzhMash, the famed missile construction complex in Dnepropetrovsk, and holds the secrets of the Satan ballistic missile, the most powerful Russian strategic weapon. He allegedly intends to share these secrets with the Israelis. If Israel were to side with Moscow regarding Ukraine, the breach with Washington would be unavoidable, and Israel does not intend to provoke it.</p>
<p>Some marginal Israeli right-wingers support Russia; they claim that they represent Israeli public opinion and government. They try to collect on their promises before they deliver. However, this is not an ordinary scam: they are trying to turn Russia into a supporter of right-wing Zionism.</p>
<p>Consider Russian-Israeli far right activist Avigdor Eskin. He impossibly claims that the Israeli government has already decided to jump from the US train to join the Russian one, that Israeli commandos are on their way to fight for the Russians in Donetsk, that Israeli authorities intend to strip Mr Kolomoysky of his Israeli citizenship. Naturally, all that is a load of bunkum, but Russians swallow it hook, line and sinker.</p>
<p>Avigdor Eskin is a colourful personality: a convert to Jewish faith (his mother is not Jewish), an observant Jew, an ex-Kahanist who was arrested in Israel for an alleged attempt to desecrate Al Aqsa mosque and a Muslim cemetery, and who served two or three years in Israeli jail; he styles himself a “Rabbi” and wears a full beard. After serving his time in jail, he moved to Russia and built a network of Israel supporters among the Russian far right. His message is “Israel is a true friend of Russia, while Muslims are Russia’s enemies”. He also adds that Israeli settlers are anti-American and pro-Russian. (If you believe that, the tooth fairy is the next step.)</p>
<p>Recently he claimed that the Aliya Battalion of “experienced Israeli commandos and sharpshooters” came to warring Donbass to fight on the Russian side against the Kiev regime troops. The Aliya Battalion is a battalion in the sense Salvation Army is an army. This is an Israeli NGO, established by Russian Israelis of far-right Zionist persuasion and of some Russian military background. It is not a part of Israeli Army. For a short while, the NGO provided guards for Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, but the settlements stopped using them as they were extremely unreliable. They boasted of murdering Palestinian civilians, of torturing and killing children, but this was just a sick sadist and racist fantasy, people say. Afterwards, the Battalion leaders turned its name into a profitable scam, roaming American Jewish communities and collecting donations for their supposedly secret activities. As this scam was exposed by Israeli TV (RTVI network; it is available on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb1mFKApacE">YouTube</a>), they had disappeared from the public eye. Now Avigdor Eskin resurrected the old scam, and made a lot of headlines in the Russian media.</p>
<p>Eskin found a soulmate in prominent Russian media man Vladimir Solovyev. The Solovyev is of partly Jewish origin, lived abroad, then returned to Russia; he runs an important political show <em>Sunday Evening</em>on Russian TV. The Saker (a well-known blogger) <a href="http://vineyardsaker.blogspot.se/2014/06/media-rage-in-russia-how-long-can.html">described him</a> as follows: “This show is hosted by a famous personality, Vladimir Solovyev, who is a very interesting guy. Solovyev is a Jew, and he is not shy about reminding his audience about it, who was even elected as a member of the Russian Jewish Congress. He is also a Russian patriot, and he is an outspoken supporter of Putin and his policies. His position on the Ukraine is simple: he as a Jew and as a Russian has zero tolerance for Ukrainian nationalism, neo-Nazism or Banderism. He is a determined and total enemy of the new Kiev regime.”</p>
<p>It is possible Solovyev is going through some personal identity crisis: from celebrating his Russian roots, he moved to proclaiming his Jewish origin. Alternatively, it is possible (and more likely) that the Russian decision-makers want to pull Jews on their side, and Solovyev is acting with US Jews in mind. Stalin did it, so Putin could repeat the trick. In 1942, as Nazi onslaught threatened Russia, Stalin had sent some Russian Jews to the US, to speak Yiddish to Jewish communities and lobby for the USSR. The American Jewish community surely carries some clout… Now Solovyev and others are trying to influence Jews abroad; or at least to show to their superiors they are trying.</p>
<p>The price Eskin extracts for his fantasy stories is high. In Solovyev’s prime time programme, he called for the destruction of al Aqsa mosque and for the building of the Jewish temple on its place. He called Palestinians “the people of Antichrist”. Even in Israel such statements can’t be voiced on public TV. In confused Moscow, Eskin was feted and given a place in another important political programme, that of Arcady Mamontov. Who is conning whom: is Eskin conning his Russian hosts, or are his media hosts using him to con their superiors, or are their superiors trying to con the Russian people? Or is Israel hedging its bets? Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>Ukrainian Jews beg to differ</strong></p>
<p>Jews came to the Ukraine a thousand years ago, perhaps from Khazaria. This is not a homogeneous community; rather, they represent several communities. A lot of them emigrated to Israel; even more moved to Russia. They speak Russian and usually do not speak Ukrainian, though they picked up the vernacular over last twenty years. Normally, they wouldn’t care about Ukraine’s independence, as Jews  traditionally side with the strong, be it Poles under Polish rule, with Russians under Moscow rule, or with Germans under Vienna or Berlin. Now many of them have decided to side with the US or EU. One of the reasons why so many people of Jewish origin do well is that the ruling ethnic groups trust the Jews and rely upon their loyalty to the powerful and lack of compassion for their Gentile neighbours.</p>
<p>Another reason is the vague definitions. For last three or four generations, Jews have intermarried freely; children of these mixed marriages are often considered ‘Jews’. These are the ‘Jews’ to the present regime; often they have only one Jewish grandparent.</p>
<p>Ukraine, following its independence in 1991, moved into the Western sphere of influence, but Eastern Ukraine (Novorossia) retained its Russian character and links. Jews did well in both parts. Mr Kolomoysky is a prominent member of the Jewish community, and a mainstay of the Kiev regime.  He is a ruthless businessman, famous for his raiding of others’properties and for his Mafia connections. Rumours connect him with many killings of business adversaries.</p>
<p>On the other side, in Kharkov, the Mayor and the district Governor (nicknamed Dopah and Gepah) are Jewish, and they can be considered pro-Russian. It was thought that Kharkov would become the centre of rising Novorossia; president Yanukovich fled to Kharkov hoping to find allies and supporters. But Dopa and Gepa disabused him, so he continued his flight all the way to the Russian city of Rostov. Their decision to remain loyal to Kiev did not work well for them: one was shot, and the second one has been imprisoned and his attempt to run for president thwarted.</p>
<p>Kharkov is also home to Mr. Hodos, a wealthy and prominent Jew who fought most valiantly against Habad, the Jewish spiritual movement of which Mr Kolomoysky is a prominent member. The Jews of Novorossia apparently support the general pro-Russian trend, though there are exceptions. Practically all Ukrainian Jews have relatives in Russia, and had Russian education.</p>
<p>Israel has a strong network of agents in the Ukraine. They snatched a Palestinian engineer and flew him to an Israeli dungeon, and that could not be done without support of Ukrainian security services. However, the stories of Israeli soldiers fighting in Ukraine are somewhat exaggerated: these are individuals of dual citizenship who act at their own will, not a state representatives.</p>
<p><strong>US Jews are divided</strong></p>
<p>US Jews are divided on the Ukraine, as they were divided on Palestine. Friends of Palestine, people with a strong anti-imperialist record and sound knowledge of East European history &#8211; Noam Chomsky and Stephen F. Cohen &#8212; recognised and renounced the US attempt to sustain their hegemony by keeping brazen Russia down. A subset of people, Gilad Atzmon aptly called AZZ (anti-zionist zionists), Trots and other faux-Leftist shills for NATO like Louis Proyect – called for American intervention and brayed for Russian blood.</p>
<p>The notorious Israel Lobby is strictly anti-Russian. The State Dept. official Victoria (“Fuck EU”) Nuland personally directed the Kiev coup; she handpicked the government and the president of the new American colony on the Dnieper River. Her husband, Robert Kagan, is a founder of FPI, the successor of infamous PNAC, the extremist Zionist think tank which promoted wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and pushed for a war with Iran. Now they attack Russia, but they do not forget about their support for Israel.</p>
<p>Consider a young American gender activist and journalist, James Kirchick. He entered the Neocon network by shilling for the Lobby. He pink-washed Israel (“Israel as the best friend of gays on earth, while the Palestinians are homophobes who deserve to be bombed”). After doing the Israeli stint, he moved on to fighting Russia. He worked for the CIA-owned and US Congress-funded Radio Free Europe; stage-managed the sensational Liz Wahl’s on-air resignation from the RT and protested alleged mistreatment of gays in Russia. His dirty tricks were revealed by <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/how_cold_war-hungry_neocons_stage_managed_liz_wahls_resignation_20140319">Max Blumenthal</a>, a Jewish American journalist, a known anti-Zionist (working together with a Palestinian Rania Khalek).</p>
<p>While Israel is neutral re Ukraine, Israeli friends in EU and US are hostile to Russia and supportive of American hegemony, while friends of Palestine stand for Russia’s challenge to the Empire. The French Zionist media philosopher Bernard Henri Levy is an example of the former, while Michel Chossudovsky of Global Research is a representative of the latter. Leading critical (“anti-Zionist”) websites Counterpunch, Antiwar, Global Research sympathise with Russia, while pro-Israeli sites are hostile to Russia.</p>
<p>Zionists are nasty and vicious enemies, but they make even worse friends. Edward N. Luttwak is friendly to Russia; he called upon the US to make up with Russia. Strategic union of Russia and America is necessary, he says. Who cares about Ukraine? And here is his pitch line: Russia should fight China for the US benefit. Another Zionist friend, Tony Blair, also calls for peace with Russia – so Russia can fight the Muslim world for Israel. Quite similar to Eskin who offers his pathetic support to Russia in order to neutralise her positive influence and defence of Palestine.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Israel remains neutral for its own reasons. While Jews as individuals differ on Ukraine, there is a correlation with their stand on Palestine and on Syria. Enemies of Putin in Russia, Ukraine, Europe and US do support Israel and are hostile to Palestine, to Syria of Bashar, to Venezuela of Chavez. And the most dangerous lot are those who support Israel <strong>and</strong> Russia, as they are surely plotting some mischief.</p>

<p>The experience of humanity is driven and defined by our own consciousness, which is a product of our sophisticated brain functions. We are consciousness in every way shape and form. Control of this miracle of <a title="6 Shifts In Consciousness We Are Experiencing Right Now" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/06/04/6-shifts-consciousness-experiencing-right-now/">consciousness</a> is sought by a few individuals who are actually suffering from a mental (disconnect) disorder. What psychiatrists sometimes refer to as the psychopathic mind. Unfortunately, one of the characteristics of being a psychopath is that the individual exhibiting the psychopathic behavior has little to no insight into their own actions. In this example, we can say that the “consciousness” is missing from the equation.</p>
<p>This insight to one’s own behavior is also a reference for distinguishing who might be considered “normal” and who might be considered schizophrenic “impaired” or “abnormal” This might lend perspective as to why groups of people (as opposed to individuals), such as governments and corporations, are capable of acting and speaking as a group in ways that are destructive to consciousness and mental and <a title="51 Symptoms of Spiritual Awakening – How Many Do You Have?" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/03/21/51-symptoms-of-spiritual-awakening-how-many-do-you-have/">spiritual expansion</a>of our species. Ironically, when an individual acts the same way, he may be considered impaired; but groups, however, will get a pass thus allowing (immune) group entities to implement such damage on the species.</p>
<p>One could measure this phenomenon scientifically by documenting physiological body changes that occur when humans are exposed to images or ideas that reflect “non-consciousness” related items (images of war, government oppression) versus measurable body changes seen when exposed to consciousness related items (love, compassion, human rights issues, etc). Basic vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure, also brain wave spikes readings, magnetic or tomography images are all factors and signs that might be measured to compare the human physiological responses to the concepts of non-consciousness-related reality versus consciousness and <a title="97 Percent of Our DNA Has a Higher Purpose And Is Not ‘Junk’ As Labeled By Scientists" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2012/09/13/97-percent-of-our-dna-has-a-higher-purpose-and-is-not-junk-as-labeled-by-scientists/">higher purpose</a>.</p>
<p>Government would have us think that it is protecting humanity from itself. This non-conscious force we call government gets its life-force from an artificial set of rules called the legal system which non-conscious government would have you think is the script that your reality is not only based on but controlled entirely by. This is like someone walking into a room and notifying everyone in the room that their consciousness and state of awareness of existence doesn’t exist any more. What? You can take someone’s money and belongings, and even forcefully do harm to them and imprison them, but how can you steal someone’s consciousness? Government’s answer to this? By eliminating it or ignoring its existence.</p>
<p>This is one of the prime realities about the concept of government and any group efforts that robs the individual human being of his/her natural state of conscious equilibrium. This is a crime like any other crime, being committed on that individual human being. This can only be appreciated from the standpoint of third party looking down on the species as a whole. When you consider it in this context it is then easy to appreciate this reality. It then becomes easy to see how non-conscious government concepts act as a cancer to the species.</p>
<p>With humanity now swimming in knowledge about itself thanks to technology and the Internet – knowledge which can no longer be ignored – we are only now beginning to see the early results of what happens when truth, awareness and consciousness is triggered by a massive pulse of lies which jolts the consciousness of the species.</p>
<h4>Edward Bernays (Propaganda) Effect Now Backfiring?</h4>
<p>With the current global awakening now accelerating at speeds that must not be pleasing to the globalist gangsters, it is reasonable to reflect back on the concept of propaganda, groupthink and group manipulation for the purposes of a certain agenda. I would like to suggest that it is possible that the global awakening we are seeing may partially and indirectly have been contributed to by <a title="The Age of Confusion – Mass Manipulation, Propaganda and Frequency Prisons" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2013/09/20/age-confusion-mass-manipulation-propaganda-frequency-prisons/" target="_blank">Edward Bernays</a> himself. After all, it was Bernays who admitted openly how these mass mind control techniques were A: Real; B: They worked; C: They worked on the masses because they worked on the individual in a perceived group setting. Bernays showed us that humans responded to clever timing, images and messages that appealed to our subconscious urges, imagination and thoughts. Can it be that we are seeing the culmination of many of these factors backfiring against the original CIA/U.S./NWO plans?</p>
<p>They hoped to continue to fool everyone with their propaganda. They planned and executed false flag operations and reinforced them with their planned propaganda, precisely timed talking points, images and sensationalism. But did they ever consider that the propaganda effect would actually wear out after so many decades of continued obvious lies and hypocrisy? Perhaps they did, and perhaps that is why there is so much talk about depopulation as seen in their own <a title="All Wars Are Well Planned Banker Wars, Including World War 3" href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/05/28/wars-well-planned-banker-wars-including-world-war-3/">Georgia Guidestones</a>. Perhaps the talk by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465027261/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0465027261&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wakitime09-20&amp;linkId=HVCDFDO3HTSJZ7MT" target="_blank">Zbigniew Brzezinski</a> about how much “easier” it is to kill a million people than control them is an admission that they know humanity will factually wake up as a whole and thus a last resort for the psychopath globalists before they must face their doom.</p>
<p>I believe this is all the end result of hundreds of years of propaganda now fully exposed due to the information age. One thing I’ll say about Bernays is that he never hid what he was doing. He told you straight forward what he was doing, even writing several books about it.</p>
<p>The global political events we are seeing exposed in real-time are a first of its kind. Because of all the released information and knowledge, and because of the Internet, we can track globalist mafia crimes in real-time in a rather exciting way which has led to the alternative or “New Media.” What started off as a truth movement with many little cousin movements all around the world has morphed into one big freedom and consciousness movement. Thankfully, many of the lines that separated us have blurred as humans recognize that they need to come together more than anything else.</p>
<p>Humanity is responding to this non-consciousness force we call government, by coming together and slowly ignoring our political, religious and philosophical differences and instead focusing on the common enemy which is now emerging as the forces that represent non-consciousness that we call governmental control systems. This is at the root of all of our struggles. We hear TV pundits tell us that humans must be controlled by a federal and global unchallenged government. Many of the script-reading advocates for the big government top-down control system just happen to have significant voices in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>No one at mainstream media dare stands for freedom and individual sovereignty. Anyone who does ends up getting fired or being asked to quit. Hollywood TV shows as well as the educational system are all supporting the paradigm of big government. Obama’s primary message to Americans seems to be about not listening to those (lunatics? radicals?) that stand for individual freedoms. Obama may actually be the only U.S. president warning America not of tyranny and the need to stand for the Constitution and Bill of Rights, but instead he’s warning his sheep to beware of those warning of tyranny. One of the things the globalists have accomplished is they’ve made it easy to identify those who are with us and those who are not.</p>
<p>Given the current global awakening in light of all the information and spiraling propaganda mentioned above, we can now simplify the battlefield in such a way that it is easy to identify the enemies of freedom. We can now ask anyone the simple question: Power to the state or power to the people, which one do you choose? Will you side with those that demand freedom and sovereignty from government or will you side with those that feel the people are the property and responsibility of big government, and those who rebel are terrorists? The state or the individual? Choose one and take sides now.</p>
<p>We know where NBC stands, and CNN and all the left-wing Obama supporters. Despite their attempts to sound pro-America, we know where Fox News and the Republicans stand also. When measured with this simple question of State versus Individual it is easy to see that both Democrats and Republicans are exactly the same. They are both controlled by criminal elements in the .1 percent class who want their one world government. It is then easy to see how the human element of humanity that is living and breathing, is now fully awakening to this non-consciousness element we’ve been calling government.</p>
<p>Now we can observe how humanity will deal with this force that has cycled its way into an over-sized oppressive control mechanism. Humanity is now realizing that freedom is more a realization than anything else. Yes, realizing something is an expression of consciousness and learning or integration of knowledge and the awareness of this newly acquired knowledge.</p>
<p>With humanity now realizing that government is a useless obstacle in the way of human thriving and freedom, I expect we will witness phenomenal things in the coming months and years. I see humanity now actually slowly but surely pulling together in an all-out effort to save itself from government.</p>
<p>I never thought of this concept myself until recently and I don’t see any other way to articulate it. This is where we are. We are now seeing the expression of this reality in many freedom lovers world wide. This was essentially the very same spirit behind the founding of America. This was the spirit behind the Constitution and Bill of Rights and the primary meme of those initial years when America was founded. It doesn’t mean that the founding fathers were saints or any of that, it means that the spirit of freedom that drove them to do what they did is back, in fact this modern-day rekindling of freedom is and will be much more intense than what the founding fathers imagined. Humanity is now realizing it didn’t finish the job. There is already a track record for getting this freedom thing done, and this track record is serving as a precious guideline for those of us who are new at this.</p>
<p>Let freedom ring, and I look forward to witnessing the end result of this focused effort now closing in on government. No, no one was injured in the writing of this article. Not a shot fired. Consciousness knows no violence, and the desire to thrive and be free is a realization. This battle is strictly mental warfare (as Bernays would have told you) and the transition from rooting for big government to control the people, to empathizing with your own species and connecting with other humans in a conscious way to exercise and celebrate your individual freedom from government is seamless.</p>
<p>Awakening from the matrix cannot be measured with blood, bullets, drones or violence. It (the individual’s awakening) can only be delayed with fear – external, engineered, artificial, government-crafted fear. This awakening is being triggered by the realization that the fear of tyranny is much greater than any artificial fears the government can come up with.</p>
<p>The human awakening has thus triggered a long-awaited re-prioritizing of fear within the species, which is rendering the globalists primary weapon of mass deception obsolete. To think, we need only overcome their engineered fears to render the concept of over-controlling big government obsolete. Once we reach this point (and we are very close) we can then focus more on officially implementing all the solutions to the new world order at a mass scale. Till then, mass knowledge of solutions are now spreading globally as part of the awakening despite the fact that many of the solutions are still being contained by government using fear and intimidation.</p>
<p>The day is soon coming when these barriers of fear will dwindle as more and more people resort to being the change they want to see in the world. It’s already happening and it’s a wonderful thing to see.</p>

<p><em>“The Doctrine and Covenants leaves no doubt about the Mormon teaching of exclusivity when it says the LDS Church is, ‘the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased….’&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Glenn Beck recently threw a hissy fit on his daily radio program over “religious people [who] claim to be followers of Christ” getting upset that he was the featured convocation speaker at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.libertyuniversity.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO_xECD3B3zPxZIsAxjvPPrtwREQ">Liberty University</a> (LU).  Beck accused those who were concerned over a cultist preaching a sermon of “absolutely smearing” LU.</p>
<p>Let’s cut to the chase.  Glenn Beck is a Mormon in good standing.  Mormonism is a theological cult.  Thus Beck’s not an authentic Christian &#8212; period.  That some Christians have the temerity to object to a cultist giving a sermon at a Christian university offended Mr. Beck, thus his rant.</p>
<p>In an earlier column I wrote <em>Questioning with boldness: Which is it Glenn, are you a Mormon or a Christian?</em> I provided an in depth examination of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mormon.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSfdiwjY03mHgCU6gpbQij8y32HQ">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.  So I’m not going to spend a lot of time re-examine it here.  However, to help you get a handle on what Mormons believe, the following is a snippet of Mormon Christianity from my column.  As you will see, what they believe isn’t even close to biblical Christianity:</p>
<p><em>LDS Christianity outright denies the Trinity which is an essential of biblical Christianity.  So LDS Christianity and orthodox Christianity do not believe in the same God.  Mormon Christianity teaches that there are many gods who are overseers of other planets.  The god of planet Earth, the one they call Elohim, was just a man with a body of flesh and bones who progressed to godhood and was rewarded with his own planet.  [Founder]Joseph Smith taught, &#8220;God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens. That is the great secret&#8230; [Y]ou have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods have done before you&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Brigham Young believed in a plurality of gods: &#8220;How many Gods there are, I do not know. But there never was a time when there were not Gods&#8230;&#8221; (</em><em>Journal of Discourses</em><em> 7:333).</em></p>
<p><em>Mormons believe that after death they will become gods and will be rewarded with their own planet.  Thereafter they will spend eternity with their many wives (polygamy) producing offspring to populate their planet.  Traditional Christianity says that God is not a man. (Numbers 23:19) Mormon Christianity teaches that man first existed as spirits in heaven.  Biblical Christianity says that the physical body comes before the spiritual. (1 Cor 15:46) </em></p>
<p><em>And LDS Christianity teaches this humdinger: Jesus and Lucifer are spirit children of God, which makes them spirit brothers. </em></p>
<p>Bible believing Christians will understand that historic orthodox Christianity does not hold to any of what Joseph Smith conjured up.  There is no way that Glenn Beck is unaware of Smith’s beliefs and background.  Later in my column I brought to light that,</p>
<p><em>…it was Joseph Smith and subsequent Mormon hierarchy that attacked Christianity.  The truth is Joseph Smith’s religion, which he made up out of whole cloth, is an abomination to God! </em></p>
<p><em>It seems weird to me that Glenn Beck spends oodles of time gathering dirt on leftist radicals and that he digs deep to get the skinny on President Obama but has neglected to do some deep digging on …  Joseph Smith.  His church’s so-called prophet was a charlatan, a polygamist, an adulterer, and he was up to his eyeballs in the occult as was his father.  There&#8217;s plenty of evidence on the web for inquiring minds that want to know the truth about Mormonism’s founder.  </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F100825&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzr5qEQKGyIX0VSWtE8Pu5TVw9GQ">Source</a>)</p>
<p>For reasons known only to him, Glenn Beck holds the LDS Church in high regard.  Consequently, he’s deluded.  Why do I say that?  To put it bluntly, Mormonism is a satanic cult.  (Those who wish to research the LDS are invited to visit my <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Femailbrigade.com%2F301.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEi125g9pqzEb3p4Yl3SZmmI99DEw">website</a>.)  LU knows this full well, yet Beck was invited to speak to its students.  As I mentioned above, Beck preached a sermon saturated with Mormon theology.  Moreover, he shared a valuable artifact &#8212; Joseph Smith’s pocket watch.</p>
<p><strong>Liberty University Enlightens Us</strong></p>
<p>Following is LU’s explanation, in part, for their decision:</p>
<p><em>We have explained over the decades repeatedly that convocation is an opportunity for students to hear from people of all faiths and from all walks of life.  Liberty has also made it clear repeatedly that it does not endorse any statements made by any convocation speaker.</em></p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p><em>By contrast, our faculty are all required to profess Liberty’s statement of faith and to affirm our doctrinal statement.  Our students are all required to take many credit hours of theology and Bible courses, regardless of their major.  Our students have no question about what Liberty’s doctrinal statement is.  It is posted publicly for all to see. Our doctrinal statement is our public statement on Mormonism.  It is the same statement that Liberty was founded upon and it will never change.</em></p>
<p><em>College is about learning.  How can you defend what you believe if you don’t understand what others believe? </em></p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p><em>I believe our students are stronger in their faith because of our convocation speaker series and the wide diversity of views that they have been privileged to hear in person over the last few decades.</em></p>
<p><em>By the way, many conservative evangelical leaders who are closer to Beck than me have told me that they believe Beck has had a born again experience recently.</em></p>
<p>Hold it right there!  The “Glenn Beck is saved” rumor has been circulating for several years thanks largely to Wall Builders Founder <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fapprising.org%2F2012%2F08%2F22%2Fdavid-barton-gave-them-revisionist-history-they-wanted%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEC1Df2rJ1avF5y10wkS5Kpt_JqIA">David Barton</a>, “American evangelicals’ favorite historian.”  If it’s true, then why is Beck keeping the good news from his friends and fans?  Moreover, if he truly is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gty.org%2Fresources%2Fsermons%2F43-13&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_c-GNIMaMa3Bqg0QcTULSU9XLDg">regenerate</a> then why hasn’t he cut all ties to the LDS Church and joined a church where the true gospel of Christ is preached?</p>
<p>LU’s explanation continues:</p>
<p><em>I do not know his heart but our audience knows that he was speaking only for himself and expressing his personal opinions and beliefs, not those of Liberty University or even of Mormonism generally. As Jerry Falwell, Sr., our founder, often used to say about speakers at Liberty who had different views than him, Liberty students are smart enough to eat the fish and spit out the bones! I believe that’s as true today as it was in his day.</em></p>
<p>Are we to assume every student is mature in their faith and has spiritual discernment?  Are we to assume that every student who attends a Christian university has been born again and thus saved? Did it not occur to Jerry Falwell, Jr. that some of the students who ate the fish Glenn Beck dished up could have choked on the bones?!</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. Liberty University has the right to invite whoever they wish to speak to its students.  But lately they seem to have an affinity for Mormons, as Glenn Beck has spoken at the university twice.  In 2010 he delivered the commencement address and received an honorary doctorate degree.  Likewise, Mormon Mitt Romney gave the commencement speech in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>A Martyr?</strong></p>
<p>Is it true that Joseph Smith died a martyr, as Glenn Beck declared to LU’s students?  Not so fast, Glenn!  The factual account of what led to Smith’s death reveal that he and his brother Hyrum were charged with treason and conspiracy by Illinois authorities whereby they were arrested and imprisoned in a minimum security cell in the Carthage city jail. According to <em>The Martyrdom of Joseph Smith </em>by Eric Johnson:</p>
<p><em>He and his brother Hyrum Smith were murdered on June 27, 1844, by an armed mob, an event that has prompted Mormons to classify them as martyrs. It has caused others, however, to raise the question whether someone who dies in a gun battle fighting against his enemies can be considered to be a martyr. A close examination of the term reveals that one must meet specific requirements to be considered a martyr, which involve, for example, the reasons why one is put to death and the way one faces such a death. An investigation of the reasons why Smith was murdered and the actions he took to avoid this fate inevitably makes it difficult to maintain that Smith was “like a lamb led to the slaughter.”</em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mrm.org%2Fmartyrdom&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFacZ_fvaA9QUBqgyowYppq_iyPpQ">Source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Johnson offers several reasons why he believes it is not accurate to classify Smith a martyr which you’ll find in his essay under the heading: THE FALLACY OF DEEMING SMITH A MARTYR.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Glenn’s Rant</strong></p>
<p>To spare you from having to read Beck’s ridiculous rant, I’ll post a few quotes from a piece by Erica Ritz:</p>
<p><em>This is why your churches are dwindling. … You think you’re standing for something, when indeed, you’re standing for hate and bigotry. I think Jesus was hanging out with prostitutes and sinners, wasn’t he? You won’t even listen to a man who says … ‘I challenge you to know your faith, not my faith, </em><em>your</em><em> faith so well that you’re willing to die for it. Stand with one another.’ That frightens you so much? If it does, you might want to consider that you’re on the wrong side.</em></p>
<p>Let’s see.  “Prophet” Joseph Smith said that “Christianity had become apostate, and all of their creeds were corrupt, and all of their followers were deceived.” Therefore, it fell to Smith not to “reform” the Christian church, but to “restore” it.”</p>
<p>And anyone who rejects Mormon heresy is “standing for hate and bigotry.”</p>
<p>More…</p>
<p><em>I look at every single lover of light and truth as my ally, my friend, my brother. … I look at everyone who is my enemy as my brother. I don’t care what you say; I don’t care what you think your belief is; I don’t care what your lifestyle is — you’re not going to change me. And I invite you to join me, join others of multiple faiths — never asking anyone to change their faith — asking you to </em><em>strengthen</em><em> your faith, whatever it is. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblaze.com%2Fstories%2F2014%2F05%2F20%2Fa-land-of-monsters-beck-fires-back-at-those-attacking-liberty-university-for-inviting-him-to-speak%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqMaAOb0SI_UwfJkoCE_eFXgPb5A">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Beck is oblivious to the fact that his <em>truth</em> is NOT biblical Truth.  On the contrary, what he’s “preaching” to anyone who’s willing to listen, and to a captive audience at LU by the way, is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fecumenism-ecumenical.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjd9SyoGRC0RpVX7taAQHRQm8Ijw">ecumenism</a>.  This New Age Mormon who professes Christ vociferously urges his followers to join together with other religious faiths and sing <em>We Are the World.</em>  If Michael Jackson were alive today, he’d be proud of Glenn.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>Glenn claims he’s read the Bible several times.  Perhaps he has.  However, he must have skipped over Paul’s teaching in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMAY0VmYFOOkoqEQo2lwys2YH5dQ">2 Cor. 6:14-16</a>:</p>
<p><em>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?

<p><strong>One last quote from Glenn Beck’s hero, Joseph Smith where we learn a bit more of his bizarre and unbiblical understanding of God, which, by his own admission is the view of God Glenn holds as he is, after all, a professing Mormon:</strong></p>
<p><em>I say, if you were to see him [God] to-day, you would see him like a man in form&#8211;like yourselves, in all the person, image, and very form as a man . . . it is necessary that we should understand the character and being of God, and how he came to be so; for I am going to tell you how God came to be God. We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity,  I will refute that idea, and will take away and do away the veil, so that you may see . . . and that he was once a man like us; yea, that God himself the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth the same as Jesus Christ himself did.</em>  (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fjoseph-smith-quotes&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYwtf-ftbue75cq3M-_9rjNcWwGw">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Now a bit of wise counsel from Erin Benziger in <em>What If ‘My God’ Is Bigger than ‘Your God’?</em> :</p>
<p><em>It is sinful pride that leads men into idolatry as they create imaginary gods that suit their own personal needs. It is the same sinful pride that prevents men from bowing low before the True God. It is this pride that refuses to acknowledge one&#8217;s own inability to offer anything truly &#8220;good&#8221; and refuses to acknowledge his own sinfulness. Yet it is God Who can, by wonderful, amazing grace, break a man of this pride and bring him to his knees in humility. It is God Who can bring the most stubborn, prideful man to a place of repentance and faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ. May we pray this day and every day that God would use us to proclaim the truth of His Gospel to such men, and may we pray that His Spirit would stir and work within those men to bring them to repentant, saving faith and knowledge of His Son. </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.donotbesurprised.com%2F2014%2F05%2Fwhat-if-my-god-is-bigger-than-your-god.html%23more&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOiM7dgApsDmJ9tYERcUPA3ZhZFw">Source</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Aliens visiting Earth would report back to their superiors: ‘It’s quite amazing, those people worship images. They know it and they pretend not to know it.’&#8221;</em> — Hypnotherapist Jack True.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a backgrounder for my mega-collection, <a href="http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/" target="_blank">Exit From The Matrix</a>, which contains many exercises designed to liberate an individual from the standardized perception of reality—and usher in his own creative reality.</p>
<p>Mass mind control focuses on two elements: image and feeling.</p>
<p>By linking the two primary elements, it is possible to short-circuit thought and “cut to the chase,” when it comes to enlisting the allegiance of huge populations.</p>
<p>Two seemingly unrelated events spurred my interest in mass mind control.</p>
<p>On the evening of April 12, 1945, I listened to a radio report on the death of Franklin D Roosevelt. I was seven years old.</p>
<p>I became upset. I didn’t know why. I was angry at my own reaction.</p>
<p>Forty years later, I pulled into a gas station near my apartment in West Los Angeles. I got out of my car and took the cap off my gas tank. I looked to my right and saw Tony Curtis sitting in his car. I was shocked.</p>
<p>A few days later, I began making notes under the heading of “image-emotion cues.” At the time, I was working as a reporter, writing articles for LA Weekly. I knew next to nothing about mind control, MKULTRA, Soviet psychiatric gulags, Chinese re-education programs, or US psychological warfare operations.</p>
<p>But because I had been painting for 25 years, I knew something about the power of images.</p>
<p>I remembered my first exhibition of paintings in LA, at my friend Hadidjah Lamas’ house. We had hung my work in her large living room and dining room. Hadidjah had enlisted the services of a friend who had videotaped me painting in my studio, and at the exhibition she set up a television set out on her patio and continuously played the videocassette.</p>
<p>People came through her front door, almost automatically walked through the house to the patio, as if guided by an unseen hand, and watched the video; then they came back inside and looked at the paintings.</p>
<p>They would stop at a painting and say: “That picture was in the video!” It excited them.</p>
<p>My first note on “image-emotion cues” was, “Investing an image with importance. Projecting emotion into an image.”</p>
<p>Projecting emotion into a newspaper image of the president, FDR. Projecting emotion into the screen image of Tony Curtis. Projecting emotion into a video of a painter working in his studio.</p>
<p>When people encounter an image, when they invest it with importance, they project feeling into the image—and this all happens in a private sphere, a private space.</p>
<p>If this didn’t happen, there would be no way to control populations through images. It wouldn’t work. It all starts with a person setting up his own personal feedback loop that travels from him to an image and back again.</p>
<p>Coming out of World War 2, US psychological warfare operatives knew they could turn their skills to political purposes. They had just succeeded in making Americans believe that all Japanese and German people were horribly evil. They had been able to manipulate imagery successfully in that area. Why couldn’t they shape America’s view of a whole planet that lay beyond personal experience?</p>
<p>They could and they did. But the power to do that emanated from the fact that every person invests images with feeling. That’s where it really starts.</p>
<p>I had seen the 1957 film, Sweet Smell of Success, a number of times. I admired it. Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis gave tremendous performances. When, decades later, I saw Curtis sitting in his car at that gas station, I was “working from” the emotion I had invested in his onscreen image. It produced a sense of shock and paralysis for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Other people might have rushed up to Curtis and asked for his autograph. With me, it was shock, cognitive dissonance. Ditto for the death of FDR. I was working off newspaper pictures I’d seen of him, and the feeling I’d invested in those presidential images. Other people, when FDR died, went out into the street and hugged their neighbors and wept openly. For me, it was upset and shock and anger.</p>
<p>There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with investing emotion in images. It can be exhilarating. It can be uplifting. As a painter, I know this in spades. Putting emotion into images can, in fact, vault you into a different perception of reality.</p>
<p>But on the downside, it can also take you into lockstep with what media/propaganda operatives want you to experience, second-hand.</p>
<p>We focus to such a degree on how we are being manipulated that we don’t stop to consider how we are participating in the operation. And our own role is clear and stark: we invest images with feeling.</p>
<p>So how does one individual’s projection of feeling into an image become a uniform projection of the same feeling into one image, by millions of people? How does what one person invests privately become mass mind control?</p>
<p>Through external instruction or cues. And also, by engendering the idea that there is only a limited palette of emotions to work with in the first place.</p>
<p>Why do millions of people fall into line?</p>
<p>Because they don’t realize they started the whole ball rolling themselves. All they know is: images are connected to feelings.</p>
<p>If they knew they were the real power in the whole operation, if they knew they were investing feelings into images all day long, if they could actually slow down enough to see how they do this….then they would be far less prone to taking instruction about what feelings they “ought to” invest in second-hand images.</p>
<p>Hypnotherapist Jack True unceremoniously put it to me this way: “If a dog could analyze how he got from eating meat to drooling at the sound of a bell that came at feeding time, he could stop drooling.”</p>
<p>(If Chris Matthews could analyze how his own voluntary investment of feeling in the image of Barack Obama sends a tingle up his leg, he could stop tingling.)</p>
<p>We see images of people rioting all over the Middle East. We see burning flags and crowds outside embassies. We’re supposed to invest our own anger and resentment into those images. Unless we’re suddenly told those rioters are actually “the good rebels,” in which case we’re supposed to invest our joy in the images.</p>
<p>We see a picture of miles of flat farmland and (GMO) corn waving in the breeze. We’re supposed to invest that image with feelings of happiness and pride.</p>
<p>Nowhere are we told we can back up a step and realize that we are the ones who begin the whole process, by projecting feelings into images. Any images.</p>
<p>When I was 19, I was sent to a trained expert in New York to take a Rorschach (ink-blot) Test. I was displaying signs of what would now be called Oppositional Defiance Disorder.</p>
<p>The expert said he wanted me to tell him everything I saw in each ink-blot. I took him at his word.</p>
<p>An hour later, I was still working on the first blot. I was describing everything from bats and owls and chickens to space ships and buckets of hidden treasure in caves.</p>
<p>Well, I was cheating a little. I wasn’t really describing what I saw. I was imagining. I was taking off from what was on the page and improvising. This was outside the bounds of the Test.</p>
<p>The expert was seething. He was sweating, because he had many other blots to show me, and it was late in the afternoon, and he was looking at spending the entire evening with me. Finally, he held up his hand and put an end to the Test.</p>
<p>I wasn’t playing his game. Among other sins, I wasn’t investing a limited palette of feelings in the images. Therefore, my choices of “what to see” in the blots expanded greatly.</p>
<p>When I go to a museum, I like to watch people stand in front of abstract paintings. Many of them are stumped. They’re trying to figure out what feelings they “are supposed to” project into the painting. They’re looking for “instruction,” and there isn’t any. They’re asking for mind control, and they’re not getting it.</p>
<p>Fanaticism of any kind begins with individuals projecting feelings into images. This is harnessed by leaders, who then choose the images and direct which feelings are permitted. The tempting prospect for the follower is: participation in a drama that goes beyond what he would ordinarily experience in life. This is bolstered by the idea that what he is doing is moral.</p>
<p>In an election season, people on the left are urged to project messianic feelings into images of X. People on the right are cued to invest feelings of pride, hope, and “tradition” into images of Y. The real candidates aren’t actually experienced.</p>
<p>Since Vietnam, shooting wars have been more difficult to sustain among soldiers. “In the old days,” feelings of hatred could be projected into images of enemies that included civilians, so overtly killing everybody on foreign soil was easier to accept. Now, soldiers are taught “enemy combatant” and “civilian” are two different images that require the injection of two different feelings.</p>
<p>Here at home, police and military are taught, more and more, to invest feelings of suspicion into images of American civilians. This is an acceleration of mass mind control for law enforcement.</p>
<p>The astonishing number of civilians who participate in government and corporate surveillance of the public, through technological means, learn to invest “dead empty feelings” into images of citizens, as if these targets are nothing more than ciphers, units.</p>
<p>Bizarre instances of police detaining and questioning parents who allow their children to play unsupervised reveal another accelerating trend. These confrontations start with neighbors snitching on the parents. The neighbors have learned to invest feelings of panic, suspicion, and anger in images of “free children.”</p>
<p>In all these cases, there is no real experience. It’s all second-hand. It’s all feeling-projected-into-image.</p>
<p>In the medical arena, countless advertisements and news stories are geared to convince people to invest feelings of trust in images of doctors. The suggestion, “Ask your doctor if X is right for you,” is framed as the solution to a little problem. The problem is set this way: Drug X is wonderful; drug X has serious adverse effects; what to do? Solution: ask your doctor; trust him; he knows.</p>
<p>As the class of victims in society has grown by leaps and bounds, including any group that can organize and promote itself as needing help or justice—going miles beyond the people who really do need assistance—citizens have been trained to invest feelings of sympathy and concern for all images of victims everywhere, real or imagined. This, too, is mass mind control.</p>
<p>Pick an image; invest feelings in it. Facts don’t matter. Evidence doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You’ve heard people say, So-and-so (a celebrity) has become a caricature of himself. Well, that’s what it means. The celebrity has projected massive feelings of approval into a concocted, cartoonish image of himself.</p>
<p>As a society, we can go on this way until we become a horrific cartoon of a cartoon (well, we’re already there), or we can step back and discover how we invest emotion into images, and then use that process to pour feelings into visions of our own choosing and invent better futures.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of time, leaders have portrayed themselves as gods. They’ve assembled teams to promote that image, so their followers could project powerful emotion into the image and thereby cement the leaders’ control and power.</p>
<p>The game isn’t new. Understanding the roots of it within each individual could, however, break the trance of mass mind control.</p>
<p>During the first West Nile fake outbreak of 1999, I spoke with a student who had just dropped out of medical school. He told me he’d been looking at electron-microscope photos of the West Nile Virus, and he suddenly realized he was “supposed to” invest feelings of “great concern” in those images.</p>
<p>Somehow, he broke free from the image-feeling link. He was rather stunned at the experience. His entire conditioning as a medical student evaporated.</p>
<p>Parents all over the world are having the same experience vis-a-vis vaccines. They realize they’re supposed to invest fear in images of germs and disease, and they’re also supposed to invest feelings of hope and confidence in images of needles and vaccines. They see the game. They’re supposed to remain victims of mass mind control.</p>
<p>But they’ve awakened.</p>
<p>We’ve all been taught that what we feel is always and everywhere out of our control. These feelings are simply part of us, and we have to act on them. The alternative would be to sit on them and repress them and turn into androids, robots.</p>
<p>This is simply not true. There are an infinite number of feelings, and as strange as it may sound, we can literally invent them.</p>
<p>This, it is said, is inhuman. It’s a bad idea. It’s wrong. It would lead us to “deserting the human community.”</p>
<p>Nonsense. That’s part of the propaganda of mind control. If the controllers can convince us that we’re working from a limited map of emotions and we have to stay within that territory, they can manipulate that limited set of feelings and trap us.</p>
<p>The power of art is that it shows us there are so many more emotions than we had previously imagined. We can be much freer than we supposed.</p>
<p>The synthetic world of mind control and the handful of feelings that are linked to images is what keeps us in thrall.</p>
<p>The world—the world of what we can be—is so much wider and more thrilling and revealing.</p>

			<p>It is easy to stand up and cheer for your favorite government activity. It is quite another to acknowledge what it means in the real world.</p>
<p>I almost never try to speak for other people. However, I think it is fairly safe to say that the average military recruit firmly believes that he joins the military so that you and I can live and breathe in freedom. To be sure, he had other reasons for joining, but I think the defense of liberty is a fairly common characteristic.</p>
<p>That is certainly what I thought when I was in Navy boot camp in Orlando, Florida, in 1983. After all, this is what I had been told all my life: sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines defend freedom.</p>
<p>But is this actually what they do?</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Marine lost both legs in an IED blast in Iraq.

<li>Listen to this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C430EHLtAZs" target="_blank">disabled Navy veteran plead</a> with then-Senate candidate Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) about the benefits of medical marijuana. Listen to the totalitarian response.</li>
<li>John Wrana, a 95-year-old Army Air Corps veteran of World War II, was <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-03/news/ct-met-kass-0802-20130803_1_butcher-type-kitchen-knife-park-forest-police-taser" target="_blank">tasered and then shot to death</a> by police in Forest Park, Illinois. His “crime”? Refusing medical attention.</li>
<li>John Colaprete saw action in Vietnam as a Marine Corps officer. In 1994, his Virginia Beach home and restaurants were the object of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/us/3-businessmen-testify-of-armed-raids-by-irs.html" target="_blank">paramilitary-style raids by the IRS</a>. The raid was prompted by a false accusation by a former employee. While you need to watch this documentary in its entirety some time, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">for now just pick it up for a few minutes starting at the 55:40 mark</a>.<br />

<li>Boxing legend Joe Louis was also tyrannized by the IRS. The Brown Bomber enlisted in the Army in 1942 saying “Let us at them Japs.” Louis never saw combat, as he was assigned to the Special Services Division. While still a civilian, Louis fought some charity bouts and donated the proceeds to the Navy Relief Society. The IRS, however, viewed these proceeds as taxable income. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Louis#World_War_II" target="_blank">IRS problems would plague him</a> all his life. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">Please watch this video starting at the 53:17 mark.</a></li>
<li>Adam Arroyo is a Hispanic veteran of the Iraq war who lives in Buffalo. <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130604/CITYANDREGION/130609629/1002" target="_blank">Police shot and killed his dog</a> while executing a drug warrant for a black man.</li>
<li>Henry Taylor was a retired Air Force veteran in Louisville, Tennessee, who was <a href="http://www.thedailytimes.com/Local_News/story/Blount-County-Sheriffs-deputy-shoots-kills-property-owner-during-security-check-id-039818" target="_blank">shot dead by a local sheriff’s deputy</a> while investigating a burglary at a rental property he owned.</li>
<li>This is a fascinating article: <a href="https://greendragontavern.com/CMS/GDT/articles/when-johnny-comes-marching-home...he-goes-to-jail" target="_blank">When Johnny Comes Marching Home … He Goes to Jail</a>. It is absolutely tragic how we chew up and spit out so many of those we send to “fight for our freedom.”<br />

<li>Radio talk host Adam Kokesh won the Navy Commendation Medal as a Marine in Iraq. In recent years, he has been <a href="http://libertycrier.com/avtm-4-0-crowdfunder-campaign/?utm_source=The+Liberty+Crier&amp;utm_campaign=00062d8203-The_Liberty_Crier_Daily_News_2_5_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_600843dec4-00062d8203-284780633" target="_blank">arrested several times for various non-violent protests</a>. His most recent arrest happened after he loaded a shotgun in public in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 2013. On July 10, police <a href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/2013/07/12/thoughts-on-the-police-raid-on-adam-kokesh-and-on-his-canceled-march/" target="_blank">violently raided his home and arrested him</a>. He was incarcerated for four months <a href="http://benswann.com/adam-kokesh-a-modern-day-political-prisoner/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=nl" target="_blank">without bond, bail or trial</a>. He is currently on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh" target="_blank">probation for two years</a>. You may not like Kokesh’s demeanor or approve of all of his antics, but he has been very courageous when so many of his critics can’t be bothered to put down the remote.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg?w=640" alt="james moore" /></a></li>
<li>James Moore, my brothah from anothah mothah, walked away from a very lucrative engineering position in San Jose to re-enlist in the Army following 9/11. He sustained significant physical injuries as well as PTSD while serving in the Special Forces in Afghanistan. On the afternoon of March 25, 2008, Moore, who had done absolutely nothing wrong, was <a href="http://www.freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/necessary-force.html">beaten to the point of flat lining by Denver police.</a></li>
<li>One of the coolest people I have never met is Antonio Buehler. Buehler graduated from West Point in 1999, earned his Ranger tab, and saw action in Kosovo and Iraq. (He also sports a Stanford MBA.) Early in the morning on January 1, 2012, Buehler <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVZDpGCKks" target="_blank">was arrested</a> for taking a few pictures of Austin police manhandling a young woman outside a 7-11. Buehler has been arrested four times since. He heads the <a href="http://peacefulstreets.com/" target="_blank">Peaceful Streets Project</a>, whose members work to expose abuse, brutality and overreach both in Austin and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FreeAntonioBuehler/" target="_blank">across the nation</a>.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/antonio-buehler.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/antonio-buehler.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168" alt="antonio buehler" width="300" height="168" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are no doubt numerous other injustices against veterans that I do not know about. Enough to fill a book. None of these things would have happened if America were a free society. As Kokesh puts it, “The greatest enemies to the Constitution are not to be found in the sands of some far off land but rather right here at home.”</p>
<p>I cannot speak to the specific political beliefs of most of the veterans I have mentioned here. Some may be pacifists, while others may make John McCain look like a hippie in Haight-Ashbury. No matter what their individual views may be, the freedom they risked their lives for was flagrantly violated on the streets of the land they fought to protect.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg?w=586" alt="With the ability to carry 192 nuclear warheads, just one Ohio-class submarine is the world's sixth largest nuclear power." /></a></p>
<p>Society endlessly applauds sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines for “fighting for our freedom”. It is in no way disrespectful to say that this is not what they do. No foreign government or terrorist group poses any threat to our liberty. America accounts for about half of the world’s military spending. We have 300 ships in our Navy, plus thousands of planes, tanks and nuclear warheads as well as 300 million firearms in private hands. Nobody is going to invade us.</p>
<p>In a constitutional country, which America ceased to be 100 years ago, the job of the military – a vital and most noble one – is to defend the borders, shores and airspace. It cannot protect you from being tyrannized domestically. Indeed, throughout history, armies have been instruments of domestic tyranny. Our Constitution forbids a standing army for just this reason.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tienanmen.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tienanmen.jpg?w=586" alt="Keeping'em free." /></a></p>
<p>Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia had enormous military establishments. How did things work out in these countries?</p>
<p>I am a Christian who believes liberty is a gift from God – Leviticus 25:10; II Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:1. To quote Jefferson, liberty is preserved not by military might, but by “eternal vigilance” against one’s own government at all levels. It is the grossest form of disrespect to send young men around the world to “fight for freedom” while relinquishing that freedom on the home front.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif?w=586" alt="soldier letter cartoon" /></a>For several years, America has had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate" target="_blank">world’s highest incarceration rate</a>. Since 2001, Americans have gladly accepted previously unthinkable intrusions on their freedom in the name of “safety” and “security”. These include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig6/napolitano2.html" target="_blank">warrantless searches and spying</a>, the <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hornberger/hornberger130.html" target="_blank">suspension of habeas corpus</a>, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2011/07/14/tsa-does-not-protect-you-period/" target="_blank">sexual assault as a condition of travel</a>, rampant <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/350955711587953/" target="_blank">police brutality</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/" target="_blank">indefinite detention</a> without any semblance of due process, severe <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2012/05/02/were-almost-there-now/" target="_blank">restrictions on peaceful protest</a>, massive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/03/11/1-6-billion-rounds-of-ammo-for-homeland-security-its-time-for-a-national-conversation/" target="_blank">ammunition purchases by DHS</a> and <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/the_empire_strikes_back_attack_of_the_drones" target="_blank">surveillance drones in our skies</a> watching our every move. Can <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2011/07/imperial-priorities-obedience-first.html" target="_blank">predator drones</a> be far behind?</p>
<p>And in every election 98 percent of voters put their stamp of approval on perpetuating this monstrosity.</p>

<p>On April 20, 2013, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/20/but-they-got-the-suspect-thats-not-the-point/" target="_blank">Boston and several surrounding towns</a> got a <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/25/lockdowns-do-not-keep-you-safe-letter-to-the-denver-post/" target="_blank">serious taste</a> of <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/23/sometimes-martial-law-is-necessary/" target="_blank">martial law</a>. How many military veterans were on the receiving end of this? Is this what they signed up to fight for?</p>
<p>Stop thinking in clichés. Have a good hard look at everything your media and government tell you. This includes media outlets and parts of the government that you like. Study. Read. Ask questions. And learn that the defense of liberty is not the duty of the military. Rather, it is your duty and mine.</p>

<p><strong>In 2008, Houston police pulled over CIA agent Roland Carnaby on what appeared to be a routine traffic stop. A few seconds later, Carnaby was dead.</strong></p>
<p>It is illegal to detain a CIA agent under any circumstances. They may carry any weapon, anywhere, anytime, and request assistance from any law enforcement official with more than certainty.</p>
<p>Why then would this incident be part of a highly classified Russian intelligence report? Could it, perhaps, be that Carnaby, answering directly to former President and CIA Director, George H.W. Bush, was murdered to silence his participation in the theft and sale of American nuclear warheads?</p>
<p>Carnaby was holding a trove of documents outlining the theft and transfer of hundreds of nuclear warheads from the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas. Weapons sent there for disassembly were transshipped to Israel and, from there, refurbished, their cores remachined and then sold around the world or stored in Israeli embassies and consulates around the world.</p>
<p>The Russian report outlines a very different view of the past 30 years, a “view” that “fits like a glove.”</p>
<p><strong>DIMONA OUT OF ACTION</strong></p>
<p>The report not only confirms Israel’s nuclear weapon inventory but outlines the program of subterfuge and piracy required to keep Israel as a nuclear power after their facility at Dimona suffered a critical “event” in 1988.</p>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #5b5b5b;"><p>“Dimona is a standard 75-megawatt thermal open top reactor as used in France for their plutonium weapons production program, their version of Stanford (Editor&#8217;s note: Probably &#8220;Hanford&#8221;).</p>
<p>Due to overuse as a fast breeder reactor by the Israelis, Dimona suffered a &#8220;steam explosion&#8221; IE a flash over indecent due to neutron criticality back in the late 1980&#8242;s under Bush 1. This shut down its operation for many years until repairs could be made.</p>
<p>It know only operates at very low power levels due to neutron absorption damage to the containment vessel. Now mainly use for isotope production. This forced the Israelis to turn to stolen nuclear stockpiles from the US for the continuation of their nuclear program.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The highly classified Russian report, released, experts believe, to demonstrate American hypocrisy over recent events in the Ukraine, is a litany of horror stories. If this is a “first shot over the bow” by Russian intelligence, American officials can only dread what may be to come.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND<br />
</strong></p>
<p>48 hours ago, the retired chief of Russia’s counter-intelligence effort for the Middle East released a highly classified report designed to embarrass the United States and demonstrate their servitude to Israel and complicity in broad acts of nuclear proliferation.</p>
<p>The report, loaded with “shock value” intelligence and backed by reams of supporting documents including classified nuclear weapons plans demonstrated that Russia has been able to maintain a high level of penetration of not just American nuclear weapons labs but security agencies as well.</p>
<p><strong>ROUND ONE, 9/11</strong></p>
<p>The report, carefully structured for maximum shock value, begins with 9/11, the watershed event of our era:</p>
<p>“The type of nuclear devices used on 911 were a modified version of the W-54 nuclear artillery shells that were covertly provided to the Israelis between 1988 and 1998 from US surplus stockpiles illegally exported during the Bush/Clinton era.</p>
<p>Chemical analysis done by DOE Sandi was able to identify the chemical/radiation footprint or fingerprint of the warheads based on samples taken after 911 of the fallout at ground zero.”</p>
<p>According to the report, 911 was an Israeli operation facilitated by blackmail of Bush 41 and 43, threatening them with “outing” for their personal financial involvement in the sale of 350 primarily w54 nuclear artillery rounds, sold through Israel but distributed to a number of nations.</p>
<p>The Russian report further outlines that NATO partners, particularly Britain and France, were involved every step of the way. 911 was cover for stolen gold, stock fraud and the looting of the American economy. The “wars for profit” were the Bush boys cashing in on their own.</p>
<p><strong>THE “HOW” OF 911</strong></p>
<p>A number of theories have been introduced to explain the mysterious effects seen at ground zero on 9/11. In an article on the Press TV website, evidence of a widespread cover-up of an epidemic of radiation exposure-related cancers tied to 9/11, was presented.</p>
<p>Not only has Russia confirmed the Press TV findings, they present evidence of nuclear weapons use, evidence from a suppressed report based on findings by the Department of Energy’s Sandia Laboratories.</p>
<p>“Only a 2 kiloton device was needed to drop the buildings. A 2 kiloton device will produce a fireball of apx 150 to 200 feet in diameter at over 4000 degrees Centigrade. Just large enough to melt the I beams of the central core of the building and drop them in place. The light flash would last less than 1 second and primarily be in the UV light range. Overpressure would only be at 60PSI max and directed upwards with the blast.</p>
<p>Fallout would be minimal and located to within ground zero range only. Radiation would drop to acceptable levels within 72 hrs. after the blast. Most fall out was trapped in the cement dust thus causing all of the recent cancer deaths that we are now seeing in NYC amongst first responders.”</p>
<p>The report continues with details that close the door on speculation about 9/11, putting an end to conspiracy theories and, in particular, the wildest one of all, the pseudo-science fairy tale broadly rejected by the 9/11 Commission but allowed to stand as America descended into an Islamophobic frenzy.</p>
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #5b5b5b;"><p>“Fallout would be minimal and located to within ground zero range only. Radiation would drop to acceptable levels within 72 hrs. after the blast. Most fall out was trapped in the cement dust thus causing all of the recent cancer deaths that we are now seeing in NYC amongst first responders.</p>
<p>Melted steel and iron oxide or &#8220;nano thermite&#8221; is a byproduct of the very high gamma ray / Neutron flux induced into the central steel core. The radiation dissolves the steel into iron oxide consuming the carbon and silicone in the steel.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This explains the missing steel columns and the very important clue of the &#8220;vaporized” 20 ton antenna tower atop the south tower. The upward blast of radiation literally vaporized it. Video evidence proves this to be true.</p>
<p>The total (redacted) data file from DOE Sandia on the 911 event is well over 72 MB. “P.S. Snowden didn’t have a Q clearance so he missed this one.”</p>
<p>The scope of the Bush/Cheney/Israeli nuclear proliferation operation, according to the report, is well beyond anything imagined. Here, Russia places the blame, naming not only Vice President Dick Cheney and former White House Chief of Staff Ram Emanuel but Tom Countryman, tasked, according to Russian sources, with actually managing the program that spread nuclear weapons to Brazil, North and South Korea, Saudi Arabia and a number of other nations.</p>
<p>“Illegal distribution of US nuclear material to foreign allies was not limited to Israel. Virtually all NATO allies were in on this scam too. Dick Cheney was the bad guy on this one. Bush2/Cheney traded nuclear pits to foreign country as IOU’s in order to get what they wanted. Tom Countryman a well-known Israeli operative is curiously now in charge of N.N.P. at the State Department under Obama. He was put there by Ram Emanuel.”</p>
<p><strong>REACTIVATING “DEAD NUKES”</strong></p>
<p>Only nuclear weapons that had deteriorated but could be recommissioned were of use to Israel. The Russian report outlines the basis for selecting the W-54 warhead and exacting details on how weapons were created out of America’s “nuclear scrap heap.”</p>
<p>“A total of over 350 pits were transferred to the Israelis over a 10 to 20 year period of time. The W-54 type of pit design were the most desirable due to the 2 point implosion pit design. This is the easiest to re manufacture and modify as compared to other circular pit designs.</p>
<p>The pill shaped design of the W-54 type weapon contains over 1.5 times more plutonium than a standard pit. This would allow enough Plutonium to be recovered that was still of weapons grade use even after 32 plus years of age. Americium build up in the pit over time eventually makes the Pit unusable as a weapon so they have a limited shelf life based on how fast or slow the Plutonium was produce in the reactor at Stanford.<br />
Usually it was about 150 days max. Irradiation time in the reactor during production determines the shelf life of the pit as weapons grade material. All of the micro nukes used by the Israelis are re-manufactured W-54 type series devices.”</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>According to the Russian report, Israel used remanufactured W-54 warheads, reconfigured as micro-nukes, for terror bombings in Bali, London and to destroy the Fukashima nuclear reaction site in Japan.</p>
<p>With weapons around the world, stored in embassies and consulates, and their powerful friends in the American “right,” Israel has managed to maintain nuclear superpower status without a real production facility, using only pirates and traitors, something America, according to our Russian sources, seems to have no shortage of.</p>

			<h4>Origin of the Master Model</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/modern-slavery.jpg" alt="" />The master plan for world domination we see playing out today was first proposed to the US at the end of World War I. However, there were no takers. People were too war weary. However, when the plan was again proposed at the end of World War II, it was accepted. Consequently, World War II quietly transitioned into the secret “war” to set up what has become known as the “new world order” — an absolute dictatorship over the entire planet.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States set up the School of the Americas to train future dictators and terrorists who would be sent out into the world to destroy sovereign nations and place them under US domination by installing puppet governments obedient to the United States. Many conquests were made quietly using clever economic tricks <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>. However, leaders who refused to submit quietly would see their entire country reduced to rubble and the land rendered unlivable by uranium dust scattered by US bombs. The message was clear: Submit to the United States or face total destruction.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A social model based upon the assumption that cleverness and power automatically convey the right to take anything desired from those who are less adept and unable to resist is not a sustainable model for harmonious social interactions. However, this is the chosen model. The mantra for this model, “A man’s true worth is measured by the amount of other peoples’ happiness that he can <em>possess </em>and <em>destroy</em>” <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote1" name="fn1">[1]</a>, is essentially a call for a class war between the greedy elite and the innocent masses of the world who simply desire a peaceful existence.</p>
<h4>Acquisitions</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States looks at the rest of the world as a “resource”. If a country has something — oil, gold, minerals, etc. — that the US covets, it believes it has the right to take those things by whatever means necessary. In many cases the coveted resource is human slave labor. Let’s look at some representative examples:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/US_ThirdWorld/US_Guat.html" target="_blank">Guatemala: The Banana Wars</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With the cooperation of the dictator, United Fruit Company (US) owned almost half of the country and used the locals as slaves to harvest its Chiquita brand bananas. However, during the period from 1945-1954 new leaders made changes. They helped the poor and set up social security and health care. Then they took land away from United Fruit and gave it to the local people. United fruit complained to the CIA that its business interests were being interfered with by the “communist” government. Any government which shows kindness to the poor and weak is called communist by the US. The US attacked Guatemala — killed the elected leaders and many thousands of citizens — and established a puppet dictatorship which would obey the will of United Fruit. The people were returned to a state of slavery. The CIA trained death squads to make sure the people were crushed into submission.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Strip Mining in Africa <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote4" name="fn4">[4]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In Africa, the International Monetary Fund — a puppet of the US — destroys a country with strip mining. The original country was self sustaining. People were able to grow lots of food and hunt animals. However, once the land was ruined by US corporations, it was unusable to plant crops and the native animals died. The people had to buy food from other countries with money loaned to them by the IMF which they could never hope to repay. Therefore, a once free and self supporting people were made debt slaves of the IMF. Once all the natural resources have been stolen, the corporations will simply pack up and leave the indigenous people to starve and die.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Countries Used as Trash Dumps <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote5" name="fn5">[5]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Used computers and associated items are dumped in poor countries where starving barefoot children sift through the mess of hazardous waste and broken obsolete glass computer monitors hoping to find something they can sell to get enough money to stay alive another day. Property stickers show the waste is mainly from the US government and various US state governments.</p>
<h4>Corruption of Trusted Sources</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reporters and News Organizations</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The masses are conditioned to believe news they receive from establishment sources. In the earlier times, this assumption was often correct. It was considered so important by the founding fathers that freedom of the press was enshrined in the US constitution. However, times have changed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Walter Cronkite was known as the “trusted voice”. No one knew he was also the official announcer at the secret Bohemian Grove meetings. The leaders of the world’s news organizations also attend this event. That is why, even though the meetings began over one hundred years ago, until recently no one knew this group even existed. President George W. Bush may have set a new record for bribing journalists to allow their trusted name to be used as the author of material actually written by government propaganda experts. Apparently, everyone has a price and the government, of course, has no problem when it comes to money.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When Ronald Reagan reportedly ordered the death of investigative reporter Jessica Savitch <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote6" name="fn6">[6]</a>, the message to independent journalists was clear: Go against the official party line an you’re done!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, dedicated journalists face mysterious deaths and strange single car accidents but a few survive long enough to give us a glimpse of truths we would otherwise never know. They are true heroes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Churches</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are everywhere. Unfortunately, legitimate Spiritual teachers are not. People look at churches either as harmless or with some sort of conditioned hypnotic respect. Churches send out “missionaries”. However, the “mission” of these missionaries may not be so clear. If you wanted to infiltrate a foreign country, these people would be an ideal asset.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are not Spiritual centers. At best, all they want is your money. At worst, they are Satanic and you are in severe Spiritual danger if you come under their influence and control.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Catholic Church has been a trusted asset of the US intelligence community for quite some time. Significant information obtained by priests during confessions is routinely passed on to the government.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This agreement predates the internet by many years. Because the church has branches in almost every country, it has great potential for covert activities. For example, if you need to get an operative who is in danger out of a country, they can go to a Catholic church for “confession”. Once the door is closed, they can exit through a secret passage, be disguised in robes and spirited safely out of the country. Church secrecy is at least on a par with US secrecy. Also, the Catholic church and the US shadow government share the same Satanic value system and engage in child rape and ritual killings.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Doctors and the Medical Industry</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Medicine in the United States is an industry. It is no longer a profession. Its corporate model puts profit above all else. If some patients accidentally benefit they are the lucky ones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The medical community has a rigid hierarchical structure and effective mechanisms for enforcing secrecy. Essentially, its model closely resembles the military chain of command structure. This makes it a perfect partner for the government in the area of secret human experiments.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, when the government was doing radiation experiments on humans, a doctor or someone dressed as a doctor would just walk up to unsuspecting patients and inject them with radioactive material. They were then secretly followed for years to see what would happen. Eventually, some of those who survived were told the truth. Most people used in the MK Ultra and subsequent secret projects were never notified.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Hospitals are set up to protect themselves. Staff may appear to be dedicated, smiling people who truly care about you. However, they are basically prostitutes who are being nice because you are worth money to them. When they make mistakes they have a “loss prevention” department staffed by clever lawyers who are trained to protect the financial interests of the hospital by denying everything and fabricating believable coverups. They are trained to do whatever is necessary. The staff will all agree to support whatever lies are needed. They know their job and their financial future depends upon maintaining strict secrecy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The only people who receive legitimate medical care are the select elite cleared to access<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>. These people always get excellent care because the doctors work for the shadow government and mistakes on their part are simply not tolerated.</p>
<h4>Infiltrations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Countries which have the resources to sustain an intelligence community generally try to get operatives (spies) into other countries so they can directly observe activities. When real people gather intelligence, this is called <em>human intelligence </em>or HUMINT. The US, of course, does this too. However, you may not be aware of the extent to which the US also infiltrates itself. The central government really does not trust anyone.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Essentially all local police departments, state offices and state governors have a covert federal agent working close by pretending to be just another employee. Also, every US neighborhood has an informer who reports to the federal government. Large corporations, which tend to behave like “mini governments”, need to be infiltrated and kept under observation. Colleges and universities are also monitored.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here is how this spy network operates: The NSA likes to recruit young kids right out of college. When they are hired and sworn to secrecy they still do not know what their assignment will be. They must agree to do this assignment without first being told what it is.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Some agents, like John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>, are assigned to work in other countries. However, others are assigned to work inside the US. Their assignment could be to go to some state and apply to join the local police department. They would pretend to be just a regular person looking for a job. They would take the necessary training and spend their life as a local policeman so they could directly observe other local police from the inside and report to the NSA. Since they are actually an employee of the NSA, presumably they get to keep both salaries and, eventually, both retirements. All significant local police forces in the US are infiltrated this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Additionally, some agents will be assigned to get a job on the state governor’s staff as well as in major local state agencies. A CIA or NSA agent is always on the staff at major colleges and universities. The same goes for major corporations.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Senior level agents are allowed to have special TV receivers in their homes linked to the secret government TV network. This way everyone stays on the same page. The channels on this network actually broadcast the truth. TV channels available to ordinary people contain only government approved propaganda mixed with “bread and circuses” presentations to make sure the <em>sheeple </em>stay asleep and content.</p>
<h4>Fronts</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US government is involved in illegal activities internationally and domestically. If it performed these activities overtly in the name of the United States, there would be serious consequences under both international and local laws. To avoid this situation, the US government operates thousands of “front organizations” which appear to be private but are actually shadow operatives of the US.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a> explained that he was recruited, hired and trained by the NSA. He was an NSA agent. However, for his cover as an <em>economic hit man</em>, he “officially” worked for a “private” company called Charles T. Main. This company was a government front to shield the US because the activities the NSA trained Perkins to do were illegal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is standard operating procedure for the US as well as other countries and many corporations. It shields them from legal recourse by providing deniability for the crimes they actually direct and commit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Generally, when the US wants to influence other sovereign countries, it creates harmless looking NGO’s which appear to be independent but are actually fronts for covert activities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Domestically, colleges and universities — especially those with associated medical schools and hospitals — are great places to conceal a variety of covert projects such as the MK Ultra series of human experiments which, reportedly, continue today using new cover names. The US also likes to create non-profit corporations which exist only to provide classified services to the United States. A good example would be the Institutes for Defense Analysis (IDA). The US, reportedly, is its only client.</p>
<h4>Programming</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Mass media “programming” is actually programming you. It has developed into a subtle form of mind control. Before radio and television, special interests recognized that motion pictures could be used to alter public opinion in their favor. Perhaps, for example, you wanted to attack labor unions. When radio and later television came along providing access to national and international audiences, the temptation to exploit these technologies became irresistible. Originally, the US government recognized this and set up fairness rules to prevent monopolies from taking over the broadcast media and blocking opposing viewpoints. All this ended, unfortunately, when Ronald Regan canceled all the fairness regulations. Today, a handful of powerful corporations own and control essentially all content delivered by radio and television.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Television is the main vehicle for mass indoctrination. It is said that people watching TV actually fall into a light hypnotic trance. The “entertainment” you see on TV does not “just happen to be there”. It is very carefully planned and timed to attract and influence targeted audiences. It is said that if some event were to somehow shut down all television broadcasts the government would experience a severe crisis because it would lose control over the minds of the masses.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">TV creates sort of a “hive mind” among the masses and keeps everyone coordinated and tuned into the official party line. Without this, people would have no choice but to start thinking for themselves and forming independent opinions. Clearly, this would be a disaster.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The radio broadcast of “War of the Worlds” and the later movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still” are said to be CIA psychological experiments to judge how the general public would react to some type of ET contact.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, broadcasting is not just a one way event. Because people react to events and use social media to express these reactions, the effect of specific propaganda can be analyzed in real time. Since the government now intercepts all electronic communications, it is able to see general opinions and then tweak algorithms to maximize the desired effect of propaganda. This ability makes TV a two-way communications system although most people, of course, do not realize this and have no concept of the level of sophistication these technologies have reached.</p>
<h4>Information Theory</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Information Theory is the name of a relatively new branch of science which became popular in the 1960′s. It covers a broad range of technologies. Basically, it is the science of the flow of information and how that flow can be selectively controlled so that information flows only in desired pathways. As you may have already guessed, governments love this sort of stuff.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>ECM</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">ECM stands for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">El</span>ectronic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co</span>unter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span>asures. In general, these are techniques to disable other electronic devices. Basically, it is electronic warfare. When the secret service is active in an area, for example, they will selectively jam all radio frequencies except for the specific frequencies they are using so that no one else can communicate.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">World leaders, who are generally terrified of “threats” materializing from practically anywhere, like to travel with ECM generators running just in case “someone” from “somewhere” was trying to target them for “some reason”. Basically, they are paranoid whack jobs.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People familiar with aviation tell the story of how Tony Blair, while traveling to or near a commercial airport, reportedly caused a commercial jet to crash because all the ECM garbage he was transmitting jammed the plane’s navigation system. Of course, the British government would never admit this.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secure Communication With Submarines</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7754" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-1.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="315" />Since submarines were invented, communicating with them has been a problem because conventional radio waves will not travel underwater. Therefore, early submarines had to get close enough to the surface to put up some kind of antenna in the air to send or receive radio messages. Obviously, this could pose a problem if you did not wish to be discovered and located. After all, the motivation to create submarines in the first place was the feeling that they would be able to move about the planet secretly. However, newer technologies now make this impossible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To solve the problem of reliable secure communication without the need to surface, scientists learned that sea water was essentially transparent to a special type of Argon laser. To set up the current communications network, it was decided to use several satellites with each satellite sending only part of an encrypted communication signal. The complete signal could only be received at a specific point underwater where all the laser beams intersected. Intercepting only one or two beams would prove useless. This communications system is considered to be impossible to intercept.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Quantum Entanglement</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Returning to the submarine issue for a moment, before modern communications were perfected, there was a search for some reliable method to send a signal to a submerged submarine that could not be detected. This was considered necessary in a war situation to secretly transmit an attack command. What they originally did was to locate a couple of people who could communicate telepathically. One would be at the command base and the other on the submarine. Doing a bit more research, it was determined that this type of communication is instantaneous and somehow operated outside of time. Radio waves travel at the speed of light.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Quantum entanglement is a process which uses technology to send and receive signals outside of space-time. Now, why would you possibly want to do this? Well, if you had a base or a colony on a planet in some other solar system light years away, you would not want to wait years for messages to be received. Following this thread — and adding some basic common sense — why would you want to dedicate resources to search for habitable planets in distant solar systems when you had already “proven” it would be impossible to ever get there? Could it just be that someone is not coming clean with whole story?</p>
<h4>The Separation Barrier</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a model of the separation barrier which insulates the ruling class from the slave class. It is essentially “intellectual apartheid”. The question is, why is it there. It takes considerable effort, money and manpower to maintain this artificial barrier. What is the reasoning behind not having a level playing field for everyone? Why does this idea absolutely terrify the elite? What are they afraid of?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Pirate Story</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a summary of a story told years ago on a radio broadcast most likely by Paul Harvey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinary people were afraid. The Earth was flat so they dare not venture far from home. Periodically, a pirate ship would come. They did not know how it got there or from where it came. It brought treasures they had never seen. The Chief Pirate would encourage the young men to study and specialize in specific skills. He wanted them to become educated but only in one narrow area. The Chief Pirate knew the world was not flat and how to navigate to other lands. However, this knowledge was never discussed. This “top secret” knowledge or the “big picture of the known world” would only be given to the Chief Pirate’s son who would inherit his title and someday become the Chief Pirate.</p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">This story is about the origin of the concept we call <em>compartmentalization</em> — the process of controlling the slave masses by only allowing them to know specific bits of the truth while the leaders are allowed to know total truth.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Leaders can only maintain their status if there are slaves. Otherwise, everyone would be equal and operate on a level playing field. This means “leaders” would have to pull their own weight like everyone else. Clearly, this would be intolerable. Leaders love beautiful and exotic things but don’t want to do the work needed to create these things. They probably could not even plant a garden much less build the various “ivory towers” where they like to live surrounded by servants. If left on their own they would very likely starve. This is why it is so important to create and maintain the complex separation barrier.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Why don’t people who live above the separation barrier ever “come down” and talk to the people below the barrier? Well, other than the obvious fact that they would likely be killed or jailed for espionage or treason, there is another, simpler, reason.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Would you like to spend your days sitting in an open field with kindergarten kids looking for four leaf clovers? Probably not. You have progressed beyond that. The slaves below the separation barrier cannot even imagine the world of those who live above the barrier. In fact, the elite do not even consider the slaves human. They call them “disposable biological units”. The United Nations prefers the slang term “the herd”. Slaves can be easily bred in quantities needed and programmed to do desired tasks. Then, they can be easily disposed of when no longer useful. That’s how they look at you. So, why would they want to make friends with you?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Mars Example</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is an interesting event playing out today that you may have noticed. This concerns the recruitment and selection of people to be sent to Mars. There are simulation projects where volunteers are locked away to imitate the long voyage to Mars. They are being told that this is a one way trip and they can never hope to return to Earth.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What you are witnessing is the selection process for the “seed people” who will be used to breed the future slave class on Mars. In a situation similar to the period when most believed the Earth was flat and you would fall off if you tried to go to sea, these people are convinced that the only way to get to mars is to ride a rocket on a perilous journey taking years. Because they truly believe this, when they get to Mars, they will teach this crap to their kids along with other misconceptions like it is impossible to go faster than the speed of light and other associated obsolete scientific principles. They will have no<br />
desire to ever return to Earth or go anywhere else because they truly believe it is not possible. They will be contented slaves.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course the truth is that there are already secret colonies on Mars. It is not that hard to get there using antigravity and other secret propulsion methods and it is quite likely possible to simply walk through some kind of wormhole device and come out on Mars.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, the slaves will never know this. Just as it is done on Earth, there will be an artificial separation barrier. The insiders will know the truth and will be physically hidden from the slaves. There will be secret police and other methods — the same as are used on Earth — to make sure no slave ever escapes from the “information prison”. Business as usual will continue.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reinforcement of Ignorance</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Governments and their oligarchs love to keep their subjects in a cloud of ignorance. Back in the days when people believed the Earth was flat, the inner circle ruling class knew it was round. Maintaining the deception was convenient because it kept the slaves from developing any desire to travel far from home.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Nothing has changed all that much today. Consider, for example, all the fuss over the missing MH370 plane. You are being played for a sucker. It is impossible for that plane to have “disappeared”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US DoD spy satellite system reportedly consists of ten constellations of satellites. Each constellation has over seven thousand satellites. They see and record everything that happens on this planet. The floor of the oceans can be seen just as clearly as the land areas. The resolution of the system is better than one square millimeter. Also, everything is recorded so you can go back in time and play past images.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7756" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-2.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="141" />This is a picture of a common electric lamp. Take this lamp and throw it in the ocean — any ocean anywhere on this planet. The spy satellite system will locate it, give you the coordinates and give you a photo at least as good as the one above. That is the capability of the system. So, clearly, it is impossible not to know the location of something as large as a Boeing 777 plane. All the TV publicity is a choreographed play. You are being scammed and you need to wake up and realize this fact.</p>
<h4>Murders and Assassinations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">To ensure a strong empire, dissent must be crushed. The United States trains assassins and carries out both domestic and foreign murders and assassinations on a regular basis. You may be familiar with the classic movie scenes where a black limousine with tinted windows drives by a target with thugs shooting machine guns. Although this would accomplish the task, it is a bit too obvious in a country that advertises itself to be a free, civilized democracy. Someone might catch on and begin to doubt the party line. Consequently, these things must be done quietly.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Inside the US, murders are reportedly carried out by a group known as “FBI Division Five”. Other agencies likely have the responsibility for foreign assassinations. However, the basic techniques used would be similar.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Typically, an agent would wake up every day and connect to the top secret internet to see who he was assigned to kill that day. There would be several options. If it was important to eliminate the target immediately, a fast acting chemical agent would be selected which, for example, would cause the target to die within a few hours of a “natural” heart attack.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, if time was not critical and the government just wanted the target out of the way, you might want to select one of the cancer causing agents such as those likely used to eliminate Hugo Chavez and Senator Ted Kennedy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is also a third possibility. This involves character assassination instead of actual murder. Consider, for example, a person who has gained a lot of public recognition talking about, say, free energy. If you simply kill the person, there could be blowback and talk that he was silenced by the government. In such cases, it is easier to use a chemical agent designed not to kill but, rather, to cause states of mental confusion resulting in obviously strange behavior. This would be coordinated with the government controlled mainstream press to make sure everyone became convinced the person was a nut and would therefore ignore anything said without regard to the truth or validity of the message.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once the appropriate chemical has been selected, you need to load it into the secret delivery system and locate your target. To find your target you will connect to the top secret internet and pinpoint the location of the target through their cell phone. You can also activate all the cameras and microphones in electronic gadgets connected to the internet associated with the target in case you wish to look around the target’s home and hear in real time what is taking place.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, this will not help you locate the target when it is time to actually do the hit. So, you need to get the top secret profile data which will show any predictable habits of the target. Everyone is constantly tracked through their cell phones and profiles are logged and stored. In this case, the profile shows that the target has a favorite restaurant and goes there for lunch every day around 11:30. Now, you know exactly what to do. You go to the restaurant, hang out until you see your target, and get in line behind the target. Now, all you need to do is slightly bump into the target to deliver the chemical. Generally, the targets never even notice.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This mission is now complete. If it is early enough, you can check back in to the top secret system to see who you are supposed to kill next. Just another day. Just a routine job.</p>
<h4>Money</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>Money</em> is an imaginary force. It is used to motivate and control slaves. Real forces effect all life forms. However, only people respond to money. The only reason they do is because they have been artificially programmed to do so.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money can be created in unlimited quantities by those adept in the use of this force. The physical world is finite, however the world of imagination is not. There is no limit to the quantity of money that can be imagined into existence. Money can also be imagined out of existence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Let’s assume that one day the entire financial system simply disappeared. If you lived in a rural area and had a nice veggie garden, some friendly chickens, collection facilities for rain water and a few photocells for electricity, you would not notice this. The veggies would continue to grow. Rain would periodically fall. The chickens would lay eggs as usual. The sun would continue to shine. However, if you lived in a city environment, you would be devastated.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Before money, people lived in small hunter-gatherer groups. The concept of ownership did not exist. People worked and survived as a group. Men and women were equal. Everyone contributed to the community. Resources were shared equally. The concept of “mine” and “yours” did not exist. Women generally became pregnant only once about every three years although there was no birth control. Later, when the concept of money entered the consciousness, women were seen as having less value because men were paid for work but women were not paid to raise and care for kids. Society has changed, however, the downgraded status of women has not.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money systems have always been manipulated by clever people. When gold was used as money, people learned they could dilute pure gold with silver or maybe even lead to come up with something that looked like pure gold and had the correct weight but was a fraud. A king suspected he was being scammed but had no way to prove it. He called on the great minds of the time for help. This led to what is known as the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://faculty.weber.edu/ewalker/Chem2990/Chem%202990%20Specific%20Gravity%20Readings.pdf" target="_blank">Archimedes’ principle</a> which is better known today as “specific gravity”. This principle made it possible to compare a sample known to be pure gold to a questionable sample and prove the unknown sample was not pure gold. Likely, some clever crook lost his head once this test became known.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is a general belief that gold is the ultimate reference for all money. However, secrets concerning the exact quantity of gold make this a perilous assumption. Reportedly, the United States stole a tremendous quantity of physical gold from Japan towards the end of World War II. This gold exists off the books. To make matters worse, Japan was not all that concerned. Japan had been using gold bars as ballast on its ships because they were compact and heavy. They thought nothing of throwing the bars overboard as necessary. Japan used platinum as a money reference and the US never got that. This should make one rethink all the hype about the value of gold. It may be a lot more plentiful than we have been led to believe. Also, the secret off the books stashes of gold would allow its relative value to be manipulated at will just like other commodity markets.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Financial Axis of Evil <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote3" name="fn3">[3]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7755" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-3.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="231" />This is the model of the financial axis of evil which rules this planet. It consists of three main branches as shown above. Collectively, they are known as “The Empire of the City”. Briefly, here is how this system operates:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The London financial district is in London, Washington D.C. is in the United States and the Vatican is in Italy. However, these three places are not part of the countries where they exist. They are independent “city states” and have their own laws and constitution. They are, effectively, “mini countries” inside of other countries and fly their own flags. The city state of London is a private corporation and pays no taxes to actual London or to Britain. The city state of London is the master power center and is controlled by the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm" target="_blank">Rothschild family</a> which considers itself to be the legal owner of this planet. The Vatican is the largest private land owner in the world and the first true multinational corporation with installations (churches) and secret agents (The Knights of Malta) everywhere. They control through the power of fear of the unknown and practice black magic. Washington D.C. relies upon brute military force. All three closely cooperate combining their specialties of financial trickery, witchcraft and military might. Of course, all three worship Satan as their Master.</p>
<h4>Slavery</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Slavery is alive and well throughout the world. The US constitution prohibits slavery, however, most americans live in slave-like conditions.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is said that it will take the average college student until age fifty to pay back their student loan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery addressed the concept of physically owning another person. However, it did not address the issue of holding another person in bondage as a debt slave. It also did not consider the concept of private for profit prisons who force inmates to work as slaves. These systems exist today and are perfectly legal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Actually, a recent report from prestigious Princeton University has reclassified the US government as an oligarchy — a country run by and for the rich elite. Former US President Carter has stated that the United States “no longer has a functioning democracy”. So much for the Founding Father’s dream. Speaking of dreams, check out the free you tube video titled “The American Dream”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Other forms of slavery are illegal but still flourish. Sex slaves are always in demand. Traffickers are sometimes caught but you need to realize that your leaders use sex slaves and also routinely abuse young girls and boys. Sometimes they are also killed during occult rituals. No one ever talks about this and these people are never punished. This has been the normal way of life for Satan worshipers for many years and nothing has changed or is likely to ever change in the future. Stanley Kubrick’s last movie, <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>, covers this subject. Some believe this intense dramatization of how the elite really live may have cost him his life.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People still have some rights left in the United States but other countries are a different story. Qatar is doing construction for the World Cup. The event is not scheduled until the year 2022, however they have <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/2022-world-cup-qatar-accused-3303458" target="_blank">already killed 1200 slaves</a> <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote7" name="fn7">[7]</a> by working them to death. People are lured from poor countries with the promise of jobs and money. When they arrive, their passports are confiscated and they are forced to work until they literally drop dead. If the World Cup is actually held in Qatar in 2022, there will be glamorous TV coverage and no one will remember or care about all the dead slaves. The show must go on.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Qatar, incidentally, sponsors Al Jazeera TV network.</p>
<h4>Adaptation Techniques</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The status quo of today will never change because the people who created it will never die. Because of <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>, when men like Henry Kissinger, who heads the Bilderberg Group’s steering committee, get too feeble to function, they will simply go to one of the secret locations and use the temporal reversal device to regress back to about twenty years old. Their memories will be unaffected. Then they will get new identities and continue on. This process can be repeated indefinitely.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Because you can never change the status quo, your best hope for a lifetime of reasonable quality is to find clever ways to live in this world with as much independence as possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">One method of adaptation is autonomous and semi-autonomous communities. If the community is registered as a religious institution it is automatically shielded from most government interference by the US constitution. It pays no taxes and can pretty much write its own rules by simply calling whatever it wants to do “religious doctrine”. Many small semi-autonomous groups exist where people who share a common set of values find ways to quietly live out their lives pretty much on their own terms. The government does not seem interested in bothering these smaller groups as long as they live peacefully and are not doing anything that the government perceives to be a threat.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Amish people are a good example of an autonomous group. You would probably not want to live as they do, however, before you completely dismiss them, you may want to look at some definite advantages in their chosen lifestyle.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Remember, these are the people who reject technology. They just might have made the correct choice. Technology, at first, seemed like a good idea. However, now that people are addicted to technology they are also enslaved by technology. Everything they do is monitored and recorded by the government. Privacy no longer exists. It did not have to be this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Technology, in itself, is not evil. However, it can be quite evil if you live under a government run by sociopathic control freaks which, unfortunately, you do. In the Amish world, electronic surveillance does not exist because electronic devices do not exist. The constant propaganda from TV has no effect on people who do not have TV. A horse does not report its position to a GPS satellite and is not controlled by a computer.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Also, the people are generally healthy and do not suffer from many diseases common to the mainstream population. They are not being poisoned by fluorinated water or additives found in processed food because they don’t use these things. Also, they get lots of physical exercise.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Without totally withdrawing from the world, there are some positive steps you can take. By now you know never to drink fluorinated water or use any personal product containing fluoride such as many brands of toothpaste. To minimize harmful food additives, look for Kosher food which is marked with either the encircled “K” or “U” (Ultra Kosher). These foods have less or no harmful additives. The Jewish community is very protective of its people and the Mossad is widely considered to be the best intelligence service in the world. Therefore, they would have the inside scoop on everything including food and do not want to see their people harmed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Whatever you decide to do, you definitely do not want to be part of so called mainstream society. These people are doomed. They are sheep (<em>sheeple</em>) slowly walking to the slaughter house. Don’t go there!</p>

<p align="LEFT">The phrase “conspiracy theorist” is a derogatory smear phrase thrown at someone in an attempt to paint them as a lunatic. It’s a tactic frequently used by modern-day thought police in a desperate attempt to demand “Don’t go there!”</p>
<p align="LEFT">But let’s step back for a rational moment and ask the commonsense question: Are there really NO conspiracies in our world?</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Attorney General of South Carolina would surely disagree with such a blanket statement. After all, he <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/019879_price_fixing_drug_racket.html" target="_blank">sued five pharmaceutical companies</a> for conducting a price-fixing conspiracy to defraud the state of Medicaid money.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Similarly, in 2008, a federal judge <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/022835_drug_racket_Big_Pharma.html" target="_blank">ruled that three pharmaceutical companies artificially marked up their prices in order to defraud Medicare.</a></p>
<p align="LEFT">In fact, dozens of U.S. states have filed suit against pharmaceutical companies for actions that are conspiracies: conspiracy to engage in price fixing, conspiracy to bribe doctors, conspiracy to defraud the state and so on.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The massive drug company GlaxoSmithKline, even more, <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/036385_GlaxoSmithKline_criminal_fraud_bribery.html" target="_blank">plead guilty to a massive criminal fraud case</a> involving a global conspiracy to bribe doctors into prescribing more GSK drugs.</p>
<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. A deeper look into the criminality of just the drug industry alone reveals <strong>a widespread pattern of conspiratorial behavior</strong> to defraud the public and commit felony crimes in the name of “medicine.”</p>
<p><strong>What is a conspiracy, exactly?</strong></p>
<p>As any state or federal prosecutor will gladly tell you, a “conspiracy” is simply when two or more people plot to commit an act of deceit (or a crime).</p>
<p>Thus, when three hoodlums plan to rob the local Quickie Mart, they are engaged in a “conspiracy” and will likely be charged with a “conspiracy to commit armed robbery” in addition to the different crime of “armed robbery.” The fact that they planned it with several friends makes it a “conspiracy” worthy of additional felony charges, you see. When these charges are brought up in court, the judge doesn’t look at the prosecutor and say, “You are a conspiracy theorist!” That would be absurd.</p>
<p>The idea, then, that there is no such thing as a conspiracy is flatly ludicrous. And people who condemn others as being “conspiracy theorists” only make themselves look mentally impaired.</p>
<p>To live in our modern world which is full of collusion and conspiracy — and yet somehow DENY the existence of any conspiracies at all — is an admission of a damaged brain. Of course there are conspiracies, and when people analyze those conspiracies, they are “theorizing” about what happened. This is, in fact, precisely the job that police detectives and FBI agents carry out almost daily.</p>
<p>Most police detectives are, in reality, “conspiracy investigators” and analysts.</p>
<p><strong>There are endless examples of real conspiracies</strong></p>
<p>Auto manufacturers routinely conspire to cover up mechanical defects that put customer lives at risk. Even National Public Radio lays out <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.npr.org/2014/03/31/297158876/timeline-a-history-of-gms-ignition-switch-defect" target="_blank">the full timeline of the General Motors conspiracy</a> to hide the problem with its faulty ignition switches.</p>
<p>Last year, food corporations conspired with the Grocery Manufacturers of America (the GMA) to<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/042546_grocery_manufacturers_association_gmo_labeling_money_laundering.html" target="_blank">commit money laundering crimes in Washington state</a> in order to funnel money into a campaign to defeat GMO labeling there.</p>
<p>The FDA <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/019497_FDA_drug_the.html">conspired with a drug manufacturer to keep a deadly diabetes drug called Rezulin on the market</a> in the USA even after safety regulators pulled the product in Europe.</p>
<p>Similarly, the corrupt, criminal-minded operators of mainstream science journals conspired in a particularly evil way to <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/031116_Dr_Andrew_Wakefield_British_Medical_Journal.html" target="_blank">railroad Dr. Andrew Wakefield with provably false accusations</a> about the nature of his research into the side effects of vaccines. The <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037249_gmo_study_cancer_tumors_organ_damage.html" target="_blank">GMO Seralini study</a> has been similarly railroaded by a genuine conspiracy of evil, corrupt science journal editors who routinely conspire to suppress all the science they don’t want to be seen by the public. Fortunately, 150 other scientists have come to support Seralini with a <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/044555_seralini_study_gmos_scientific_integrity.html" target="_blank">global condemnation of the obviously contrived scientific censorship</a>.</p>
<p>We live in a world of such deception and collusion that, frankly stated, it’s hard to find a large institution (such as medicine, agriculture or the war industry) which isn’t involved in some sort of conspiracy at some level.</p>
<p><strong>What is a “conspiracy theorist?</strong></p>
<p>The pejorative “conspiracy theorist” is meant to demean and ridicule skeptics of official stories.</p>
<p>Most so-called “conspiracy theorists” are really skeptics, by definition. They’re skeptical of what the government tells them. They’re skeptical of the claim that drug companies are really only interested in helping humankind and have no desire to make money. They’re skeptical that food corporations are telling them the truth about what’s in their food. And they’re also skeptical of anything coming out of Washington D.C., regardless of which party happens to be in power at the time.</p>
<p>People who are not skeptics of “official stories” tend to be dull-minded. To believe everything these institutions tell you is a sign of mental retardation. To ask questions, on the other hand, is a sign of higher intelligence and wisdom.</p>
<p>Skeptics of official stories, it turns out, also have the support of history on their side. How many times has it later been revealed that the American people were lied to by the very institutions we were supposed to trust?</p>
<p>For example, it is an historical fact that <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041345_cdc_polio_vaccine_sv40.html" target="_blank">98 million Americans were injected with hidden cancer viruses</a> which were later found in polio vaccines strongly recommended by the CDC. In an effort to cover that up and rewrite history, the CDC later <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041593_CDC_polio_vaccine_SV40_cancer_virus.html" target="_blank">scrubbed all accounts of that history from its website</a>, pretending it never happened.</p>
<p>That’s more than a cover-up; it’s an Orwellian-style conspiracy to selectively rewrite history and deny Americans any memory of a monumental, deadly error made by the CDC in collusion with the vaccine industry.</p>
<p>According to two former Merck virologists, that company conspired to <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/036328_Merck_mumps_vaccine_False_Claims_Act.html" target="_blank">fake the results of its vaccine tests</a> by spiking test samples with animal antibodies, thereby falsely distorting the results to make the vaccine appear effective. The two virologists filed a False Claims Act with the federal government detailing the conspiracy, saying:</p>
<p><em>Merck also added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, though it knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that “did not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life … virus neutralization in vaccinated people…”</em></p>
<p><strong>Conspiracies of money and big banks</strong></p>
<p>Every month, the Federal Reserve conspires to steal a portion of your wealth through “quantitative easing” — an irresponsible money creation scheme that devalues all the currency already in circulation (i.e. the money in your bank account).</p>
<p>The money the Fed creates is, not surprisingly, handed over to the big Wall Street banks — the same banks that received <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/45674390" target="_blank">a jaw-dropping $29 trillion in “bailout money”</a> since the near-collapse of U.S. banking in late 2008.</p>
<p>Why did this bailout money go to the banks instead of the American people? Because <strong>powerful people sat in dark rooms and colluded to send the money to the most influential banks</strong>. A conspiracy, in other words, by definition.</p>
<p>Had that same amount of money been equally distributed across the U.S. population, the Fed would have distributed nearly $100,000 to each and every citizen in America; man, woman and child. But instead of enriching the population, the banking bailout <strong>burdened the population</strong> with the debt now owed to the Fed by future taxpayers.</p>
<p>Every $1 trillion created by the Fed, after all, is $1 trillion “loaned” to the U.S. Treasury which must somehow be repaid. In truth, the minute you start to investigate how money is created, why the Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel and why the big banks get all the bailout money, you run head-first into genuine conspiracies almost from the outset. When you look up the word “conspiracy” in a dictionary, it should probably say, “See Banking and Finance.”</p>
<p><strong>Our world is full of conspiracies because it’s full of people who deceive</strong></p>
<p>The reason conspiracies are real is because humanity is a race capable of extreme deception. As long as there are people whose actions are based in greed, jealousy and a desire to dominate others, there will be real conspiracies plotted and operating across every sector of society.</p>
<p>The correct term for “conspiracy theorist” should really be “conspiracy analyst.” Most of the people who are skeptical of official stories are, in fact, <strong>analyzing conspiracies</strong> in an attempt to understand what really happened and what took place behind closed doors.</p>
<p>A highly-recommended book the delves into this matter in more detail is the five-star-rated masterpiece <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Official-Stories-Counter-Arguments-Culture-Need/dp/147756134X" target="_blank">Official Stories: Counter-Arguments for a Culture in Need</a> by Liam Scheff.</p>
<p>This book will open the minds of those who still have the cognitive capability remaining to grasp it. (Sadly, the injection of mercury into babies in the form of vaccines has damaged so many brains across America that many people are now cognitively incapable of rational thought.)</p>
<p>And remember: the next time someone flings the phrase “conspiracy theorist” in your direction, simply know that they are effectively wearing a DUNCE hat on their heads by admitting they have failed to acknowledge that true conspiracies are rather commonplace.</p>
<p>That’s not merely a theory, either: it’s a statement of fact.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The grimmest dictatorship is the dictatorship of the prevailing orthodoxy&#8221; - </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/02/international/europe/02galloway.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=a3295fe213e5261f&amp;ex=1277956800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">George Galloway</a></p>
<p>In a relativism culture of social permissiveness, the non-judgmental attitude, held out as the suitable standard for conduct, has become the politically correct behavior. One might think that anything goes under this mindset. However, the exact opposite practice and enforcement, under the most rigid conditions, is championed as necessary for enlighten and tolerant liberalists. The proliferation of demands that hate speech is the new capital crime, actually is counter iterative in building a civil society. This orthodoxy of the fanatical, proudly presents this illuminated and required deportment, as obligatory for all citizens.</p>
<p>So what exactly is hate for the neo-Jacobins? Obviously, whatever the &#8220;<em>Society of the Friends of the LIVING Constitution</em>&#8221; deems it to be, because under the color of law, the self-proclaimed pure of heart, are justified to off the heads of anyone who dares speak out in inappropriate terms. Remember &#8220;thinking progress&#8221; for the greater good, must be imposed on anyone who dare defies the wisdom of the gatekeepers for the collective.</p>
<p>Racism has to go, unless practiced by Negros against whites, or is the mere mention of such a term a slight to African-Americans? Once upon a time cries of anti-Semitism would be heard if <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/la-naacp-head-resigns-move-honor-sterling-23556060">Donald Sterling</a> was made a pariah after the NAACP did an about face after awarding him for promoting civil rights. Not in today’s world, such a distasteful zealot no longer has the protection of his tribe from the scrutiny of the thought police. The almost total condemnation of his recently private remarks has the entire sports world clambering for his forced sale of the LA Clippers.</p>

<p>Such broad-minded fans in a league that made homies multimillionaires and took them out of the hood, must not be dis. No wonder the attraction of not just the NBA, but sports in general, have serious minded buffs of the Wide World of Sports looking for, &#8220;<em>The Thrill of Victory&#8230;</em>&#8221; in other arenas. Why not demonstrate that sporting enthusiasm and jock celebrity worship, by starting a grassroots campaign to install America’s favorite redneck, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/conservatives-defend-duck-dynasty-star-phil-robertsons-anti-gay-remarks-1516160">Phil Robertson</a> and his Duck Dynasty clan, as the new ownership of the team.Surely, good standing Democrats should have no problem supporting a bunch of good old boys from the South. Frances Rice writes in the National Black Republicans Association site that, <a href="http://www.nationalblackrepublicans.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=pages.DYKKKKTerroristArmoftheDemocratParty">KKK Terrorist Arm of the Democratic Party</a>. &#8220;This ugly fact about the Democrat Party is detailed in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Reconstruction-Eric-Foner/dp/0060964316">A Short History of Reconstruction</a>, (Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc., 1990) by Dr. Eric Foner, the renowned liberal historian who is the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. Dr. Foner in his book explores the history of the origins of Ku Klux Klan and provides a chilling account of the atrocities committed by Democrats against Republicans, black and white.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/">Carole Emberton</a>, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today. Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Fast forward to today’s conductor <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/eric_holder_hate_crimes_and_his_people.html">Eric Holder</a>, of selective bigoted <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/032414.html">racism</a>, when describing &#8220;his people&#8221;, who &#8220;seem to get a pass on hate crime charges when they select whites for their blood sport&#8221;, one needs to question who the real haters are. David Risselada provides a valid assessment in the essay, <a href="http://patriotupdate.com/articles/hate-crimes-legislation-racial-identity-politics-institutional-racism-left/">Hate Crimes Legislation . . . Racial Identity Politics and the Institutional Racism of the Left</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The institutional racism that is built in our society is the responsibility of the left. Throughout history it has been the democrats who have supported segregation and slavery while continuously voting against civil rights legislation. Today, they attempt to hide their history through racial identity politics, and the creation of a system where inequality is the new equality. By creating laws based on racial preferences, the left is telling minorities that they believe they are not as capable as white men and therefore need their programs in order to stand a chance in the racist United States of America. This does little but reinforce hatred while attempting to justify black on white violence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time and in a place long ago, the Democratic Party defended the rights of the individual to associate with individuals of their choosing and speak their minds openly and without concern of censor. Since the conversion to ecumenical orthodoxy, the authoritarians that gave you the New Deal and the Great Society have a long record of creating their own hatred of Free Speech. The example of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?hp">New York Times</a> vicious attack on <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2014/04/24/cliven-bundy-controversial-remarks-full-context-video-with-transcript/">Cliven Bundy</a> illustrates another trumped-up incident ripe to exploit.The New American, author William F. Jasper makes the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Much of what Mr. Bundy is saying closely parallels what even many black leaders, authors and intellectuals — such as Prof. Walter Williams, Rev. C.L. Bryant, Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, Bill Cosby, Alveda King, Star Parker, and Alan Keyes — have been saying. But Cliven Bundy’s &#8220;sin&#8221; is that he is an elderly white man who is unschooled in traversing the minefield of political correctness — and he was careless in failing to make important distinctions and clarifications. He &#8220;sinned&#8221; by being born when he was born, and failing to keep up with the constantly changing terminology for ethnic designations. He still uses the terms &#8220;Negro,&#8221; &#8220;colored people,&#8221; and &#8220;Mexican,&#8221; instead of &#8220;black/ African American&#8221; or &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; — but then, race activists still argue amongst themselves concerning the &#8220;proper&#8221; ethnic label to apply to their lineage and group identity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When Senator <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/goodbye-free-speech-mass-dem-wants-government-to-monitor-speech-for-hate">Ed Markey</a>, D-Mass., introduces legislation called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2014-04-08_HateCrimes_Legislation1.pdf">Hate Crime Reporting Act of 2014</a>,&#8221; it is another partisan concerted attempt to silence voices and views entirely protected under the First Amendment, by monitoring radio, television and Internet speech. Can one say arbitrary and capricious, or will Big Brother now prey on any convenient and moving target to label anyone as a hate monger, that does not conform to the &#8220;PC&#8221; orthodoxy?</p>

<p>The excellent video from Ben Swann identifies in <a href="http://youtu.be/fTn6skhq-08">New &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; Bill Will Attempt To Control Speech On Internet, Radio and TV</a>, that the real objective is to censor the internet.</p>
<p>Well, this development should concern any student of inquiry, but the real world often fosters political threats that seem to be so implausible, if they were not true. The case of the arrest of <a href="http://vdare.com/posts/britain-quoting-winston-churchill-about-islam-is-now-an-arrestable-offense">Paul Weston</a> should alarm everyone. In the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/michael-coren-interviews-paul-weston-concerning-his-free-speech-arrest">Michael Coren interview or Mr. Weston</a>, the vanguard of British lunacy once again blazes new trails in the annals of hate speech. If quoting Winston Churchill is now a crime, what does that make Winnie?The British Bulldog is his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property — either as a child, a wife, or a concubine — must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Move over denial ridden Americans; the English have a talent in leading the civilized world in false guilt. For the rest of humankind, they are perceptive enough to admit that the normal human condition acknowledges <a href="http://batr.org/view_/060501.html">Discrimination as a Virtue</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Discrimination has been characterized as racism. Quite to the contrary, discrimination is an ally in the struggle to end bigotry and injustice. When Liberty is suppressed in a quest for equality; hatred and revulsion breeds, for different groups, cultures and ideologies. All attempts to force equal treatment are futile, even when severe penalties are imposed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Condemning a person, solely by his beliefs, bias and predisposition – that fanatical frenzy will surely bring about the fall of our cherished tradition of Free Speech. For those who fear Sharia Law, you had better be more concerned about the progressive despots, who are the model for imposed intolerance through a government, which hates everyone that refuses their Groupthink.</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">So, what do we have here? In Libya, in Syria, and elsewhere the United States has been on the same side as the al-Qaeda types. But not in Ukraine. That’s the good news. The bad news is that in Ukraine the United States is on the same side as the neo-Nazi types, who – taking time off from parading around with their swastika-like symbols and calling for the death of Jews, Russians and Communists – on May 2 burned down a trade-union building in Odessa, killing scores of people and sending hundreds to hospital; many of the victims were beaten or shot when they tried to flee the flames and smoke; ambulances were blocked from reaching the wounded. Try and find an American mainstream media entity that has made a serious attempt to capture the horror.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And how did this latest example of American foreign-policy exceptionalism come to be? One starting point that can be considered is what former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Robert Gates says in his recently published memoir: “When the Soviet Union was collapsing in late 1991, [Defense Secretary Dick Cheney] wanted to see the dismemberment not only of the Soviet Union and the Russian empire but of Russia itself, so it could never again be a threat to the rest of the world.” That can serve as an early marker for the new cold war while the corpse of the old one was still warm. Soon thereafter, NATO began to surround Russia with military bases, missile sites, and NATO members, while yearning for perhaps the most important part needed to complete the circle – Ukraine.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In February of this year, US State Department officials, undiplomatically, joined anti-government protesters in the capital city of Kiev, handing out encouragement and food, from which emanated the infamous leaked audio tape between the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, and the State Department’s Victoria Nuland, former US ambassador to NATO and former State Department spokesperson for Hillary Clinton. Their conversation dealt with who should be running the new Ukraine government after the government of Viktor Yanukovich was overthrown; their most favored for this position being one Arseniy Yatsenuk.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">My dear, and recently departed, Washington friend, John Judge, liked to say that if you want to call him a “conspiracy theorist” you have to call others “coincidence theorists”. Thus it was by the most remarkable of coincidences that Arseniy Yatsenuk did indeed become the new prime minister. He could very soon be found in private meetings and public press conferences with the president of the United States and the Secretary-General of NATO, as well as meeting with the soon-to-be new owners of Ukraine, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, preparing to impose their standard financial shock therapy. The current protestors in Ukraine don’t need PHDs in economics to know what this portends. They know about the impoverishment of Greece, Spain, <em>et al</em>. They also despise the new regime for its overthrow of their democratically-elected government, whatever its shortcomings. But the American media obscures these motivations by almost always referring to them simply as “pro-Russian”.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">An exception, albeit rather unemphasized, was the April 17 <em>Washington Post</em> which reported from Donetsk that many of the eastern Ukrainians whom the author interviewed said the unrest in their region was driven by fear of “economic hardship” and the IMF austerity plan that will make their lives even harder: “At a most dangerous and delicate time, just as it battles Moscow for hearts and minds across the east, the pro-Western government is set to initiate a shock therapy of economic measures to meet the demands of an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Arseniy Yatsenuk, it should be noted, has something called the Arseniy Yatsenuk Foundation. If you go to the <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #02588d;" href="http://openukraine.org/en/about/partners" target="_blank">foundation’s website</a> you will see the logos of the foundation’s “partners”.  Among these partners we find NATO, the National Endowment for Democracy, the US State Department, Chatham House (Royal Institute of International Affairs in the UK), the German Marshall Fund (a think tank founded by the German government in honor of the US Marshall Plan), as well as a couple of international banks. Is any comment needed?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Getting away with supporting al-Qaeda and Nazi types may be giving US officials the idea that they can say or do anything they want in their foreign policy. In a May 2 press conference, President Obama, referring to Ukraine and the NATO Treaty, said: “We’re united in our unwavering Article 5 commitment to the security of our NATO allies”. (Article 5 states: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all.”) Did the president forget that Ukraine is not (yet) a member of NATO? And in the same press conference, the president referred to the “duly elected government in Kyiv (Kiev)”, when in fact it had come to power via a coup and then proceeded to establish a new regime in which the vice-premier, minister of defense, minister of agriculture, and minister of environment, all belonged to far-right neo-Nazi parties.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The pure awfulness of the Ukrainian right-wingers can scarcely be exaggerated. In early March, the leader of Pravy Sektor (Right Sector) called upon his comrades, the infamous Chechnyan terrorists, to carry out further terrorist actions in Russia.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">There may be one important difference between the old Cold War and the new one. The American people, as well as the world, can not be as easily brainwashed as they were during the earlier period.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Over the course of a decade, in doing the research for my first books and articles on US foreign policy, one of the oddities to me of the Cold War was how often the Soviet Union seemed to know what the United States was really up to, even if the American people didn’t. Every once in a while in the 1950s to 70s a careful reader would notice a two- or three-inch story in the <em>New York Times</em> on the bottom of some distant inside page, reporting that <em>Pravda</em> or <em>Izvestia</em> had claimed that a recent coup or political assassination in Africa or Asia or Latin America had been the work of the CIA; the<em>Times</em> might add that a US State Department official had labeled the story as “absurd”. And that was that; no further details were provided; and none were needed, for how many American readers gave it a second thought? It was just more commie propaganda. Who did they think they were fooling? This ignorance/complicity on the part of the mainstream media allowed the United States to get away with all manner of international crimes and mischief.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It was only in the 1980s when I began to do the serious research that resulted in my first book, which later became <em>Killing Hope</em>, that I was able to fill in the details and realize that the United States had indeed masterminded that particular coup or assassination, and many other coups and assassinations, not to mention countless bombings, chemical and biological warfare, perversion of elections, drug dealings, kidnapings, and much more that had not appeared in the American mainstream media or schoolbooks. (And a significant portion of which was apparently unknown to the Soviets as well.)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But there have been countless revelations about US crimes in the past two decades. Many Americans and much of the rest of the planet have become educated. They’re much more skeptical of American proclamations and the fawning media.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">President Obama recently declared: “The strong condemnation that it’s received from around the world indicates the degree to which Russia is on the wrong side of history on this.”  Marvelous … coming from the man who partners with jihadists and Nazis and has waged war against seven nations. In the past half century is there any country whose foreign policy has received more bitter condemnation than the United States? If the United States is not on the wrong side of history, it may be only in the history books published by the United States.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Barack Obama, like virtually all Americans, likely believes that the Soviet Union, with perhaps the sole exception of the Second World War, was consistently on the wrong side of history in its foreign policy as well as at home. Yet, in a survey conducted by an independent Russian polling center this past January, and reported in the <em>Washington Post</em> in April, 86 percent of respondents older than 55 expressed regret for the Soviet Union’s collapse; 37 percent of those aged 25 to 39 did so. (Similar poll results have been reported regularly since the demise of the Soviet Union. This is from<em>USA Today</em> in 1999: “When the Berlin Wall crumbled, East Germans imagined a life of freedom where consumer goods were abundant and hardships would fade. Ten years later, a remarkable 51% say they were happier with communism.”)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Or as the new Russian proverb put it: “Everything the Communists said about Communism was a lie, but everything they said about capitalism turned out to be the truth.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">A week before the above <em>Post</em> report in April the newspaper printed an article about happiness around the world, which contains the following charming lines: “Worldwide polls show that life seems better to older people – except in Russia.” … “Essentially, life under President Vladimir Putin is one continuous downward spiral into despair.” … “What’s going on in Russia is deep unhappiness.” … “In Russia, the only thing to look forward to is death’s sweet embrace.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">No, I don’t think it was meant to be any kind of satire. It appears to be a scientific study, complete with graphs, but it reads like something straight out of the 1950s.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The views Americans hold of themselves and other societies are not necessarily more distorted than the views found amongst people elsewhere in the world, but the Americans’ distortion can lead to much more harm. Most Americans and members of Congress have convinced themselves that the US/NATO encirclement of Russia is benign – we are, after all, the Good Guys – and they don’t understand why Russia can’t see this.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The first Cold War, from Washington’s point of view, was often designated as one of “containment”, referring to the US policy of preventing the spread of communism around the world, trying to block<em>the very idea</em> of communism or socialism. There’s still some leftover from that – see Venezuela and Cuba, for example – but the new Cold War can be seen more in terms of a military strategy. Washington thinks in terms of who could pose a barrier to the ever-expanding empire adding to its bases and other military necessities.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Whatever the rationale, it’s imperative that the United States suppress any lingering desire to bring Ukraine (and Georgia) into the NATO alliance. Nothing is more likely to bring large numbers of Russian boots onto the Ukrainian ground than the idea that Washington wants to have NATO troops right on the Russian border and in spitting distance of the country’s historic Black Sea naval base in Crimea.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">The myth of Soviet expansionism</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">One still comes across references in the mainstream media to Russian “expansionism” and “the Soviet empire”, in addition to that old favorite “the evil empire”. These terms stem largely from erstwhile Soviet control of Eastern European states. But was the creation of these satellites following World War II an act of imperialism or expansionism? Or did the decisive impetus lie elsewhere?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Within the space of less than 25 years, Western powers had invaded Russia three times – the two world wars and the “Intervention” of 1918-20 – inflicting some 40 million casualties in the two wars alone. To carry out these invasions, the West had used Eastern Europe as a highway. Should it be any cause for wonder that after World War II the Soviets wanted to close this highway down? In almost any other context, Americans would have no problem in seeing this as an act of self defense. But in the context of the Cold War such thinking could not find a home in mainstream discourse.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The Baltic states of the Soviet Union – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – were not part of the highway and were frequently in the news because of their demands for more autonomy from Moscow, a story “natural” for the American media. These articles invariably reminded the reader that the “once independent” Baltic states were invaded in 1939 by the Soviet Union, incorporated as republics of the USSR, and had been “occupied” ever since. Another case of brutal Russian imperialism. Period. History etched in stone.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The three countries, it happens, were part of the Russian empire from 1721 up to the Russian Revolution of 1917, in the midst of World War I. When the war ended in November 1918, and the Germans had been defeated, the victorious Allied nations (US, Great Britain, France, <em>et al.</em>) permitted/encouraged the German forces to remain in the Baltics for a full year to crush the spread of Bolshevism there; this, with ample military assistance from the Allied nations. In each of the three republics, the Germans installed collaborators in power who declared their independence from the new Bolshevik state which, by this time, was so devastated by the World War, the revolution, and the civil war prolonged by the Allies’ intervention, that it had no choice but to accept the <em>fait accompli</em>. The rest of the fledgling Soviet Union had to be saved.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">To at least win some propaganda points from this unfortunate state of affairs, the Soviets announced that they were relinquishing the Baltic republics “voluntarily” in line with their principles of anti-imperialism and self-determination. But is should not be surprising that the Soviets continued to regard the Baltics as a rightful part of their nation or that they waited until they were powerful enough to reclaim the territory.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Then we had Afghanistan. Surely this was an imperialist grab. But the Soviet Union had lived next door to Afghanistan for more than 60 years without gobbling it up. And when the Russians invaded in 1979, the key motivation was the United States involvement in a movement, largely Islamic, to topple the Afghan government, which was friendly to Moscow. The Soviets could not have been expected to tolerate a pro-US, anti-communist government on its border any more than the United States could have been expected to tolerate a pro-Soviet, communist government in Mexico.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, if the rebel movement took power it likely would have set up a fundamentalist Islamic government, which would have been in a position to proselytize the numerous Muslims in the Soviet border republics.</p>

<p>In &#8220;<em>The attack on biblical creation in UK schools continues</em>,&#8221; Phil Robinson reports that in the dechristianized U.K. unrelenting attacks against special creation (Genesis account) display a level of aggressive intolerance that is hard to stomach, coming as they do from self-proclaimed scientifically-enlightened ‘voices of reason.’  Some schools have already banned the teaching of special creation in favor of evolutionary science.   (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>, Mar. 9, 2014)</p>
<p>Other shrill &#8216;voices of reason&#8217; go so far as to connect special creation to mental illness and child abuse. During a radio interview in Australia famous physicist and atheist propagandist Lawrence Krauss said that while in the United States recently, he stated that &#8220;<em>teaching creationism is child abuse and I think it is.&#8221; </em>(Prayer News, a publication of Creation Ministries, Apr. 2014)</p>
<p>Throughout the West and here in America a slash-and-burn operation conducted against the Genesis account, particularly its&#8217; literal and historical elements, is justified by the false idea that evolution is science, thus intolerance of special creation is often presented as a ‘science versus religion’ or ‘faith versus reason’ issue.   So successful has this war of attrition been that younger generations of Westerners and Americans have been disconnected from both Western history and its’ founding Christian-based worldview, thus like seedlings recently popped up from the soil are unconcerned that special creation, where the ultimate source of life, being and unalienable rights are found, has nearly been displaced by anti-human pagan conceptions positing billions of years of evolutionary transformism from lower kinds of things to higher and higher kinds of things&#8212; even non-human kinds of things:</p>
<p><em>“For us, the best way to create new (‘artificial’) life forms and intelligence is to allow them to emerge through evolution, as nature does, only in much shorter timeframes and with much greater efficiency and variety.”</em></p>
<p><em><br />
“For conscious evolution to be successful, we need to observe and understand the actual workings of nature, in all its dynamism, to the point of profound reverence, or ‘worship.’ This is what I call extreme nature-worshipping… From the perspective of extreme nature-worshipping, the real significance of Darwin’s evolutionary theory is not that humans descended from lower species, but that we can continue to evolve.”</em>(Cosmic Beings: Transhumanist Deism in Ted Chu’s Cosmic View, Institute for Ethics &amp; Emerging Technology, Giulio Prisco)</p>
<p>The vicious name-calling, seething resentment toward and censorship of the six day creation account and of all who profess and teach it should raise the eyebrows of any rational thinking person.  If evolution really is a fact of science then why the irrational name-calling, ridicule, scorn, shunning, resentment, intolerance and demonization?</p>
<p>The answer is that the zealous worshipper of evolution is the Spirit of our age that emerged out of the Renaissance whose answer to the Lord Jesus Christ is the Cross (crucify Him) and whose fulfillment will be the Wicked One. (2 Thess. 2:1-8)</p>
<p>From the Renaissance to our own time the Spirit has been transgressing, blaspheming, and departing that it need not obey His voice.   Like a dog returning to its own vomit, the Spirit has returned to its first love: the cult of demons in the Godless universe of matter, psychic energy, and animated forces where time is changed, past history rendered meaningless, and the liberated Spirit imbibes the cup of wrath, an intoxicating mixture of Babylonian Mysteries, incantations, spiritism, Gnosticism, sorcery, witchcraft, Hermetic magic, Kabbalah, reincarnation, astrology, and other devilish occult traditions.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation pinpoints Babylon as the post-flood center of an occult pagan Mystery religion based on advaitic monism, science of magic transformism, exalted priesthood, gnosis, secret initiations, psychic-powers, familiar spirits, androgyny, sexual perversions, and other evils.</p>
<p>Babylon embraced the Great Lie. Its inhabitants claimed the title, &#8220;I AM.&#8221; The root source of this evil religion and its occult power was the Great Dragon himself&#8230;.Lucifer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. <em>the Great Lie </em>(is) <em>the foundation stone of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, Sikhism, Taoism, the Kabala, the Greek Hermetic, Eleusinian and Gnostic beliefs, Neo-Platonism, all the occult creeds from Theosophy and the Masonic orders to the Rosicrucian&#8217;s (and) the New Age movement. The Great Lie is&#8230;the belief that man is God, that his true identity is the immortal self&#8230;that as God, he will never die </em>(and) <em>Sin and depravity are&#8230;illusions since this inner divinity is at man&#8217;s core.&#8221;</em> (The Great Lie, Tal Brooke, SCP Journal, Vol. 29:2-29:3, 2005)</p>
<p>Though the Spirit of our age claims the title “I AM” it nevertheless follows after and falls down before other fascinating men: theoreticians of evolutionary science, nature philosophy and evolutionary pagan theology. These charismatic Pied Pipers are possessed of surpassing powers of persuasion and inflexible determination of will to which the Spirit assigns more honor than to anything else.</p>
<p>The Spirit has usurped the throne of the Word Incarnate (John 1:1) because He is not good, not just or benevolent but a devil, an evil Tyrant Who, with His infliction of suffering in this life and eternal punishment in the next must be deposed. (Psalm 2:2-3)</p>
<p>Blaming our Lord for their own sins the proud, self-righteous Spirit of rebellion, hypocrisy and negation says to Him, “…<em>you are not my father</em>.”  My father is the god of forces, therefore:<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;I am I, I come out of myself, and in choice and action I make myself.&#8221;</em> (Daniel Bell, quoted by Herbert Schlossberg in &#8220;Idols for Destruction,&#8221; p. 43)</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the Spirit of our age is the “<em>striving human will</em>” seeking desperately to launch itself,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;into minor godhood in an evolving cosmos through the mechanisms of directed spiritual evolution, spiritualized science and spirit contact</em>.&#8221; The &#8216;new&#8217; spirituality now presents itself as the <em>&#8220;rightful replacement for the Revealed Word </em>(and)<em> proclaims its spiritual liberation from the worldview that informs Christianity and its freedom from </em>(the)<em> personal and wholly other God.  But this new way of self-salvation</em> (is)<em> little more than the refurbishing of an ancient spiritual mistake</em>.&#8221;  (The Making of the New Spirituality: the Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 279)</p>
<p><strong>“As it was in the days of Noah…” </strong></p>
<p>The ominous signs of this age are obvious, said the English theologian G.H. Pember (1837-1910) in his book, &#8220;<em>The Antichrist Babylon and the Coming Kingdom</em>.&#8221;  Just as it was during the pre-flood generations, open intercourse with demons (spiritism) is now common throughout Christendom and even in Russia.   In France it is the national pastime.   The apostles of the powers of darkness are everywhere proclaiming their scientific and evolutionary theories demonstrating that the world created itself and had no need of a Creator (p. 60) while the miseries which have resulted from sin,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>are blasphemously charged upon the Almighty, Who so loved the world as to give His son for it </em>(but is now)<em> impiously forbidden to curb and discipline the rebels who owe their existence to the breath of His mouth.  And when we see such men as John Stuart Mill </em>(and) <em>John Morley, the late Chief Secretary for Ireland&#8230;guiding their fellows to defiant insubordination, we can scarcely wonder that Bradlaugh&#8230;said, ‘This world might have been happy, had not the shadow of God fallen upon it.</em>” (pp. 35-36, 1888)</p>
<p><strong>Rise of Occult Evolutionary Science </strong></p>
<p>In the impeccably researched, &#8220;<em>The Making of the New Spirituality</em>,&#8221; James Herrick observes that the scientific tradition in Renaissance Europe developed around three basic approaches: the organic, the mechanical and the magical.   It was magical and/or occult science that provided the greatest impetus for scientific exploration. (p. 45)</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis underscores this point in “<em>The Abolition of Man</em>:”</p>
<p>“<em>You will even find people who write about the sixteenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know better. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse. I allow that some (certainly not all) of the early scientists were actuated by a pure love of knowledge. But if we consider the temper of that age as a whole we can discern the impulse of which I speak.”</em></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>God and the Knowledge of Reality</em>,&#8221; the Catholic philosopher and historian, Thomas Molnar (1921–2010), reveals the &#8216;temper of that age&#8217; as a spirit of rebellion against the Christian God, and this is why occult science and evolutionary thinking provided the greatest impetus. During the Renaissance, certain Christian theologians, mystics and scholars such as Emanuel Swedenborg had discovered Hermetic magic and occult Jewish Kabbalah texts which they studied and translated resulting in Hermetic Kabbalah. Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science – the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures (spiritual evolution) is the best proof of the divinity of Christ. In other words said Molnar,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;..by the time of the Renaissance the esoteric texts of the first centuries A.D. had acquired in scholarly and humanist circles an unparalleled prestige, confronting as equals the texts held sacred by the church. In Pico&#8217;s estimation, &#8216;nulla est scientia que nos magis certificet de divinitate Christ quam magia et Cabala&#8217; (there is no science that would prove for us Christ&#8217;s divinity better than magic and the Cabala.)&#8221; </em>(pp. 78-79)</p>
<p>Hermetic magic and Jewish Kabbalah are ancient Mystery Religion traditions, as affirmed by G. H. Pember in his classic work, &#8220;<em>Earth&#8217;s Earliest Ages.&#8221;   </em>Pember thoroughly examines the role of fallen angels in connection with the magic (occult transformism) they taught to pre-flood generations and compares them to the explosion of spiritism (open intercourse with evil spirits), astrology, the Mysteries and other occult traditions sweeping over Christendom.</p>
<p>Pember writes that the Mysteries are no longer veiled in mystery but boldly presented by the powerful occult brotherhood that emerged out of the Renaissance as the fruit of modern science, especially evolutionary philosophy, which the brotherhood assert was included in the instructions given,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>to the initiates of the Hermetic, Orphic, Eleusinian, and Cabbalistic mysteries, and were familiar to Chaldean Magi, Egyptian Priests, Hindu Occultists, Essenes, Therapeutae Gnostics, and Theurgic Neo-Platonists</em>.&#8221; (Pember, pp.243-244)</p>
<p><strong>Hermetic Magic<br />
</strong><br />
Hermeticism is an ancient Egyptian secret magic tradition based on a set of fourteen books known</p>
<p>collectively as the Corpus Hermeticum attributed to a mysterious figure known as Hermes Trismegistus. Implied in Hermeticism is an evolutionary process of magical transformism (spiritual evolution) moving from one kind of lower thing to another kind of higher thing:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Human beings are themselves the product of a long spiritual evolutionary process that moves from &#8216;creeping things&#8217; to fish, mammals, birds and then people.  Humans can&#8212;through occult knowledge and extraordinary ability&#8212;continue this evolutionary process and become daemons, then gods, and finally planets or stars</em>.&#8221; (The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 40)</p>
<p>With respect to Hermes identity, researchers of antiquity are divided.  Some believe Hermes was a mythical figure.  Others argue he was Ham or his son Cush.  The historian Samuel Shuckford argues that Hermes was Pathrusim, king of Thebais, the son of Mizraim, the son of Ham.   His Egyptian name was Tyoth or Thoth.  (The Sacred and Profane History of the World Connected, 1808)</p>
<p>In any case, it was Thoth-Hermes who instructed his brothers in the arts and science magic of alchemy or transmutation of a lower kind of thing into a higher kind of thing. For example, after a lengthy transformative process out of the eternally existing divine abyss (primordial matter), the self-created Sun-God Ra boasted that he “<em>came into being from primordial matter.”  </em>He made all the forms under which he<em> “appeared by means of the god-soul” </em>which he raised up out of Nu, primordial matter. (The Long War Against God, Dr. Henry Morris, p. 243)</p>
<p><strong>Occult Kabalah</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Kabalah is the key to the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists</em>.” (Occult Mason Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 626)</p>
<p>Like its’ Hermetic counterpart, Kabala implies a process of evolutionary transformism:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;the older Enoch book </em>(gives) <em>a fuller insight into the &#8220;Merkabah&#8221; and &#8220;Bereshit&#8221; lore of the ancients than the &#8220;Hekalot,&#8221; which present but fragments, while the central figure of the Cabala, Meṭaṭron-Enoch, is seen in ch. lxx.-lxxi. in a process of transformation</em>.” (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Helena Blavatsky, one of the key architects of Luciferian New Age pantheism, Kabalah derived,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em> from the older secret doctrines concerning divine things and cosmogony, which were combined into a theology after the time of the captivity of the Jews in Babylon. All the works that fall under the esoteric category are termed Kabalistic.” </em>(Blavatsky, Theosophical Glossary, p. 168)</p>
<p>The godless cosmogony of Kabala teaches the gradual condensation or evolutionary progression of a primal substance into visible matter.  This is a fundamental,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em> doctrine of the Cabala </em>(and<em>) is the ancient Semitic conception of the ‘primal ocean,’ known to the Babylonians as ‘Apsu’ and called by the Gnostics βύθος =</em>  (Anz, ‘Die Frage nach dem Ursprung des Gnostizismus,’ p. 98).</p>
<p>The Chaldean occult science and pagan Mystery Religion was embraced by apostate Jews during their captivity in Babylon and delivered to subsequent generations of initiates by word of mouth. According to Blavatsky, these initiates of the Chaldean tradition in the centuries before Christ were known as Tanaim:<br />
<em>“The kabalist is a student of ‘secret science’, one who interprets the hidden meaning of the</em></p>
<p><em>Scriptures with the help of the symbolical Kabala… The Tanaim were the first kabalists among the Jews; they appeared at Jerusalem about the beginning of the third century before the Christian era… This secret doctrine is identical with the Persian wisdom, or ‘magic’</em>.” (Ibid. p.167)</p>
<p>The Essenes were also associated with the Kabala. The Jewish Encyclopedia describes the cabalistic practices of the Essenes, which were Judaized elements of Eastern mystical traditions:</p>
<p>“<em>So, too, were the Essenes familiar with the idea of the journey to heaven…and they were also masters of angelology. The practice of magic and incantation, the angelology and demonology, were borrowed from Babylonia, Persia, and Egypt; but these foreign elements were Judaized in the process, and took the form of the mystical adoration of the name of God and of speculations regarding the mysterious power of the Hebrew alphabet …, ‘the name of God creates and destroys worlds’, to become, finally, foundations of the philosophy of the ‘Sefer Yetzirah</em>.&#8221;  (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Blavatsky the Essenes were pagan priests of the Greek goddess, Diana of Ephesus, where the Tanaim had established a college for instruction in the Chaldean mystery religion:</p>
<p>“<em>Essenes&#8230; had many Buddhistic ideas and practices; and it is noteworthy that the priests of the Great Mother at Ephesus, Diana-Bhavani with many breasts, were also denominated&#8230; It was at Ephesus where was the great College of the Essenes and all the lore the Tanaim had brought from the Chaldees&#8230; Essenes, believed in reincarnation</em>.” (Theosophical Glossary, pp. 113-14; The Secret Doctrine, Vol. II, p. 111n)</p>
<p>Eventually Alexandria, Egypt became the epicenter of cosmological and pagan religious ideas as well as the intellectual meeting point between Greek Mystery Religion/Hermetic magic initiates and nature sages and guardians of Kabala.  After the fall of Jerusalem, Alexandria was the center from which occult pagan Jews would disguise their mystery tradition in Christian terminology and attempt to penetrate the fledgling Church with heresy.</p>
<p>One of the primary tactics employed by Cabbalist pagan Jews for this purpose is the same one employed by their modern evolutionary Gnostic pagan counterparts.   It involves the reduction of the Genesis account, particularly the first three books, to allegory and myth, a ploy that eliminates the physical Adam from which all people descended and the sin that he transferred to the rest of the human race. This strikes directly at the heart of the Gospel: the need for the ‘last Adam’ to provide for us an escape from the wrath of God against sin incurred by the first Adam.  In this way, not only is the work of Christ on the cross rendered superfluous, meaning the heart of the faith is ripped out, but God is made responsible for sin and evil. (1 Peter 3:18-22; 1 John 2:22)</p>
<p>Long ago, the teachings of some of the early Church Fathers regarding the apostasy toward the end of the church age predicted the reappearance of this evil tactic. The fathers categorized it a Gnostic pagan heresy.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Heresies 6.10&#8243;</em> Hippolytus writes that the Gnostic pagan Simon Magus feigned faith and allegorized much of Scripture, especially Genesis, to support his evolutionary Hermetic and Gnostic occult pantheist teachings.   Church Fathers Ireneaus, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria reveal that Gnostic cult leader Marcion rejected the Old Testament, taught that the God of the Old Testament and his prophets are evil, made God the author of sin and removed all references that Christ was Creator (John 1:1)   (Ireneaus, &#8220;Against Heresies 1.26, 5.1,&#8221; Tertullian &#8220;Against Marcion 2.17,&#8221; Clement of Alexandria, &#8220;Against Heresies 4.29)</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Babylonian Mystery Religion is the mother of evolutionary Cabala, Gnosticism and all other occult pagan traditions:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;.especially does Gnosticism testify to the antiquity of the Cabala. Of Chaldean origin&#8230; Gnosticism was Jewish in character long before it became Christian&#8230; Gnosticism—that is, the cabalistic ‘Hokmah’ (wisdom)—seems to have been the first attempt on the part of the Jewish sages to give the empirical mystic lore, with the help of Platonic and Pythagorean or Stoic ideas, a speculative turn; hence the danger of heresy…of which the systems of Philo, an adept in Cabala&#8230;show many pitfalls&#8230;Jewish gnosticism unquestionably antedates Christianity, for Biblical exegesis had already reached an age of five hundred years by the first century C.E.  Judaism had been in close contact with Babylonian-Persian ideas for at least that length of time, and for nearly as long a period with Hellenistic ideas. Magic, also, which,&#8230;was a not unimportant part of the doctrines and manifestations of gnosticism, largely occupied Jewish thinkers. There is, in general, no circle of ideas to which elements of gnosticism have been traced, and with which the Jews were not acquainted.”  </em>(Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>

<p>In the essay,<em> “The Paganization of Biblical Studies</em>,” Dr. Peter Jones, director of truthxchange and adjunct professor of Westminster Seminary CA., writes that the books of the evolutionary Gnostic pagan Presbyterian heretic Lloyd Geering, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University, are promoted by the most powerful element of the Spirit of our age—the international occult New Age Luciferian elite-pagans&#8212;as programmatic templates for the future utopian pagan community from the point of view of Christian apostasy and socialism undergirded by evolutionary pantheist orthodoxy.</p>
<p>According to Geering, the world&#8217;s future culture will be post-Christian, global, religiously pagan and evolutionary.  This agenda is remarkably similar to that of Teilhard de Chardins’ disciple, the ex-Roman Catholic Thomas Berry in his book, <em>&#8220;The Great Work</em>&#8221; which is also being implemented through texts of the UN&#8217;s global programs.</p>
<p>The rising New World Order will be post-Christian because evolution proves that human beings, as they evolved out of primordial matter, created language, then symbols, then religious explanations and God Himself.  Therefore tomorrow&#8217;s culture will be pluralistic, syncretistic, relativistic and poly-gendered because evolution integrates all scientific, cultural, religious, economic and human gender into one worldwide anthill thus when the global society emerges from the evolutionary process,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…it will require humanity to develop a new consciousness and a new form of spirituality</em>&#8221; because <em>&#8220;the new story which has become basic to the global world begins with a new word or idea&#8230;evolution.” </em>(ibid, Jones)</p>
<p>Like its’ mother, Mystery Babylon, the scientifically-enlightened ‘new&#8217; global religion of evolutionary transformism is occult pantheist advaita monism, which means that as an ancient impersonal god-force is within the cosmos, earth, human beings, rats, weeds, tumble bugs, cancer and everything else then all things are essentially &#8216;one.&#8217;  Since the god-force is within all things it is within the demonically &#8216;illumined&#8217; consciousness of every spiritually evolved initiate and adept.</p>
<p>This being the case, by means of trance states, brain-altering drugs, transcendental meditation, visualization, channeling, Zen Buddhism, Kundalini yoga, tantra, and other occult ways, the initiate can channel the god-force within thereby becoming a little god who controls matter because he controls mind. The physical world then, is an illusion because reality is inside the divine mind of the god-man.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is captured by Orwell in his book, “<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>” in which negation of the physical world is an integral part of the social and political philosophy of Big Brother and his despotic Party. At one stage in the book, Winston stumbles upon the shocking realization that in the end the Party would announce that two plus two made five because the logic of Big Brothers’ position required it since the existence of external reality was denied by his philosophy.  Thus when the Thought Police agent O’Brien tortures Winston for politically incorrect “wrong thought” he states,</p>
<p><em>“We control matter because we control the mind.  Reality is inside the skull.  You will learn by degrees, Winston.  There is nothing that we could not do.  Invisibility, levitation&#8212;anything.  I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to….You must get rid of these nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature.  We make the laws of Nature.” </em>(Orwell, “The New Spirituality and its Hallmarks, Alan Morrison, SCP Journal, Vol. 30:4-31:1, 2007, p. 19)</p>
<p><strong>Evolving Toward Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>The Aquarian Conspiracy</em>,&#8221; a book that has been called &#8216;the New Age Bible,&#8217; Marilyn Ferguson (1938-2008) admits that the ‘new age’ evolutionary pantheism and occult technologies being employed throughout America were at one time the private domain of ancient initiates.   In fact, as Constance Cumbey reveals in her thoroughly researched book, <em>&#8220;The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow,&#8221;</em> many New Age historians claim their occult religion and techniques originated in Atlantis and afterward were preserved in the ancient land of Babylon,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;and surrounding Plains of Shinar and from there disseminated throughout the earth, including Taoist doctrines of China, Mayan-Aztec teachings of Mexico and Central/South America; Great Spirit teachings of the American Indians, Hindu/Buddhist teachings of Asia, etc.&#8221; </em>(pp. 250-251)</p>
<p>After the Flood, said Shuckford, while the faithful Noah remained in the East and established the worship of the true God, eighty years after the Flood his rebellious son Ham and his sons together with other family members departed and eventually settled in the plains of Shinar where they resolved to build a tower, a monument to their own pride, vanity, ambition and rebellion against God. (ibid, p.94)</p>
<p>It was Noah’s son Ham, according to ancient Church Father Clement, who  ‘preserved’ and revived the Mystery Religion of ‘Atlantis’ and its attendant evils:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Fallen angels taught men the use of magical incantations that would force demons to obey man. After the flood Ham the son of Noah&#8230;discovered this and taught it to his sons.  This became ingrained into the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians.  Ham died shortly after the fall of the Tower of Babel.  Nimrod, called Ninus by the Greeks, was handed this knowledge and by it caused men to go away from the worship of God and go into diverse and erratic superstitions and they began to be governed by the signs in the stars and motions of the planets</em>.&#8221; (Recognitions of Clement 4.26-29)</p>
<p>In his well-researched book, &#8220;<em>Ancient Post-Flood History</em>,&#8221; Ken Johnson, Th.D., reports that the sons of Ham persuaded the people to accept that the true God was merely an impersonal creative force within all of nature, making man the highest form of life/god.  Through the power of persuasion, Ham and his sons revived magical evolutionary transformism, pantheism and idolatry. (pp. 47-48)</p>
<p>Eventually Ham was deified and worshipped by later pagans as the gods Cronus and Jupiter:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ham is represented by many writers as a very wicked, immodest, and profligate creature: Berosus (i) makes him a magician, and to be the same with Zoroast or Zoroastres, and speaks of him as the public corrupter of mankind; and says that he taught men to live as before the flood, to lie with mothers, sisters, daughters, males and brutes, and creatures of all sorts; and that he actually did so himself, and therefore was cast out by his father Janus, or Noah, and got the name of &#8220;Chem&#8221;, the infamous and immodest&#8230;&#8221; Upon seeing his father&#8217;s nakedness Ham,  &#8220;told his two brethren without; he went out of the tent after he had pleased himself with the sight&#8230; and in a wanton, ludicrous, and scoffing manner, related what he had seen: some of the Jewish Rabbins (k), as Jarchi relates, say that Canaan first saw it, and told his father of it; and some say (l), that he or Ham committed an unnatural crime with him; and others (m), that he castrated him; and hence, it is supposed, came the stories of Jupiter castrating his father Saturn, and Chronus his father Uranus.&#8221; </em>   Genesis 9:22 Gill&#8217;s Exposition</p>
<p>History did not begin after billions of years of evolution when primitive hominids swung down from the trees and discovered how to scratch crude symbols onto rocks.    Nor did it begin after the Flood.  At least 2,000 years of human existence preceded the Flood, meaning that when Noah and his family entered the ark they carried at least one hundred years of pre-flood memories, traditions, technology, and superior knowledge. Their world view was shaped by the historical Adam and Eve and the generations of their offspring.   Thus Noah and his family brought with them not only the knowledge of the personal God, Special Creation, fall of man, the Deluge, sacrifice to God for the propitiation of sin, the arts of weapon-making and warfare, knowledge of letters, symbols, math, architecture, science, cosmetics, and agriculture  but knowledge of  first-hand encounters with Watchers, their occult teachings, the Nephilim, and primeval pantheism tied to magic, spiritism, herbal abortifacients, human and animal sacrifice, drinking of blood, males marrying males and even beasts, and many other evils.</p>
<p>In affirmation, the eminent researcher of antiquity James Bailey said:</p>
<p>“…<em>human history can now be hesitantly traced back as an unbroken narrative to 4000 B.C….the picture emerging…is one of the Fall of Man in historic terms as well as his rise; it is a picture…more of degradation than of success; it is a picture of monotheism breaking down into polytheism and of the struggle to return to monotheism.  The establishment view of the history of religion gradually progressing from animism to polytheism </em>(then)<em> to monotheism is the reverse of facts</em>.” (“The God-Kings and the Titans: The New World Ascendancy in Ancient Times 1973, p. 296)</p>
<p>Four thousand years before Christ were the antediluvian generations and the Watchers in the post-flood world, making the billions of years of evolutionary transformism a fabulous fable.  It is neither ‘new’ (Ecclesiastes 1: 9-11) nor scientific except in the sense of pre-flood and post-flood occult science and attendant traditions revised and revamped for our own time, as Geering unhappily discovered.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones writes that Geering was surprised when he found out that the<em> ‘New Spirituality’ </em>has <em>&#8220;links with pre-monotheistic&#8230;nature religions,</em>&#8221; leading Jones to wryly comment that in an odd turn of events,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;.contemporary spiritual&#8217; evolution goes backwards!  Biblical theism disturbed evolutionary progress.  The clocks have to be put back </em>(for we are in the presence of)<em> a powerful pagan/Gnostic theological agenda, claiming to be spanking new, objective and scientific, but as old as the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>Clocks have to be turned back, all the way back to the days of Noah in the pre-flood world where evolution is closely connected to the devil’s lie that man is a being who though presently limited in time and space is nevertheless capable of achieving a great leap of being and magically evolving into a much more powerful god-like being in the future.</p>
<p>As the scientifically endarkened Gnostic pagan Spirit of our age simultaneously worships on the altar of ‘self’ as it self-righteously peers down its’ long, pointy nose and contemptuously sniffs and sneers at the remnant of backwards, unscientific, anti-evolution  faithful, in reality it is the entirely deluded pagan Spirit that is on a collision course with a modern version of the pre-flood world catastrophe&#8212;-and we know how badly that ended.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">According to The Salt Lake Tribune, “It’s time for Western states to take control of federal lands within their borders, lawmakers and county commissioners from Western states said at Utah’s Capitol on Friday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“More than 50 political leaders from nine states convened for the first time to talk about their joint goal: wresting control of oil-,timber-and mineral-rich lands away from the feds.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘It’s simply time,’ said Rep. Ken Ivory, R-West Jordan, who organized the Legislative Summit on the Transfer for Public Lands along with Montana state Sen. Jennifer Fielder. ‘The urgency is now.’</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“Utah House Speaker Becky Lockhart, R-Provo, was flanked by a dozen participants, including her counterparts from Idaho and Montana, during a press conference after the daylong closed-door summit. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee addressed the group over lunch, Ivory said. New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington also were represented.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“The summit was in the works before this month’s tense standoff between Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management over cattle grazing, Lockhart said.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“‘What’s happened in Nevada is really just a symptom of a much larger problem,’ Lockhart said.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sltrib.com%2Fsltrib%2Fpolitics%2F57836973-90%2Futah-lands-lawmakers-federal.html.csp&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpCMp3rdO1K_3HsZXKqIvIH22tpw" target="_blank">Western Lawmakers Gather In Utah To Talk Federal Land Takeover</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now we are getting somewhere!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The western states have been used as both playground and sugar stick for big-government politicians since before most of the western states became states. Compare the percentage of State land owned by the federal government in the western states to that of the eastern states.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here is the percentage of land owned by the federal government in seven eastern states:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Illinois: 1.8%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ohio: 1.7%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Alabama: 1.6%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Maine: 1.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">New York: 0.8%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Rhode Island: 0.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Connecticut: 0.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By contrast, here is the percentage of land owned by the federal government in seven western states:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Wyoming: 42.3%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">California: 45.3%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Arizona: 48.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Idaho: 50.2%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Oregon: 53.1%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Utah: 57.4%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Nevada: 84.5%</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The situation with the Bundys in Nevada highlights the heavy-handed tactics that the federal government employs against anyone who dares to challenge the manner in which the feds are attempting to kick hard-working, productive citizens off of federal lands. Remember that ranchers and farmers such as Cliven Bundy were promised access to these federal lands in perpetuity back in the nineteenth century when all of these land deals were being negotiated between the states and the federal government. Beyond that, ownership of the land by the federal government was supposed to preserve and protect the land for the people, not for the federal government.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A few years ago, there were dozens of successful and prosperous ranchers in the area around the Bundys. But since the BLM was given legislative mandates when Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) in 1976, Cliven Bundy is now the only rancher in the area still standing.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The BLM has grown into a totalitarian monster.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, the BLM regulates hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, boating, hang gliding, shooting, off-highway vehicle driving, mountain biking, bird watching, and visiting natural and historical sites. The BLM also regulates logging, mining, fracking and other activities. What ranchers such as Cliven Bundy are going through loggers and miners are also experiencing. In fact, it is no hyperbole to say that, for all intents and purposes, the ranching, logging, and mining industries in the western states are being systematically regulated out of existence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And in the case of Cliven Bundy, it is not about saving the Desert Tortoise or grazing fees or anything of the sort. It is all about letting fat-cat politicians such as Harry Reid negotiate lucrative solar energy deals with Communist China. Hey, folks: if the land doesn’t belong to Cliven Bundy, it doesn’t belong to Harry Reid, either!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The BLM’s evil twin sister is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was established in 1970. These two federal agencies have become the Wicked Witch of the East and Wicked Witch of the West in what used to be a beautiful land paved with yellow brick roads.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">I dare say that if the eastern states were enduring the haranguing and harassment that the western states are enduring, the BLM would have been brought under control years ago. Absent national unity from eastern states on the matter, it is time for the western states to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The legislative action being contemplated by the above-mentioned State legislators who assembled in Salt Lake City last Friday is a terrific first step. It is absolutely time for the western states to use their eminent domain authority to reclaim the lands within their borders that are currently owned by Washington, D.C. With the exception of National Parks, states should serve notice that they are taking back the land owned by the federal government&#8211;land that should never have been ceded to the central government to begin with.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The second problem that the siege against Cliven Bundy illustrates is the unconstitutional police powers assumed by federal agencies such as the BLM. Originally, the only federal agency that was lawfully allowed to make arrests on behalf of the U.S. government was the U.S. Marshals Service, which was created back in 1789&#8211;the year that the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Today, there are scores of alphabet agencies of the federal government who carry a badge and a gun and are allowed to enforce law at bayonet point. And the vast majority of these agencies are acting on assumed authority&#8211;authority not granted them constitutionally. Among these, there is no greater culprit than the BLM.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“You don’t send the Seventh Cavalry to collect a bill, and that’s exactly what happened,” Pat Buchanan told Sean Hannity on his radio show last Monday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Buchanan went on to say, “And when they put all those forces out there-that’s what attracted all the others, the history of what happened at Waco, Ruby Ridge. And so these folks came to that rancher’s defense. But the initial problem here is [the] sending of all the force of arms out there to that ranch, which was a provocation to which these folks responded.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">See the report here:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtontimes.com%2Fnews%2F2014%2Fapr%2F22%2Fpat-buchanan-sums-nevada-sending-seventh-cavalry-c%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzyHxXC-lxsYy8ZqPoCg0lqT3OGg" target="_blank">Pat Buchanan Sums Up Nevada Ranch Standoff: Sending ‘Seventh Cavalry To Collect A Bill’</a></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Constitution delegates only three crimes to the federal government: treason, piracy, and counterfeiting. That’s it. No other crimes are mentioned. That means that all other crimes are the purview of the states&#8211;including local and State police, sheriff’s deputies, and citizen militias and posses.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, the problem is the Congress (and Court) in Washington, D.C., has used the “Necessary and Proper Clause” of Article. I. Section. 8. to justify all sorts of federal law enforcement enactments.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The result of this unconstitutional federal expansion of police powers is we now have scores of federal agencies that are using unchecked and unbridled power&#8211;power that is turning the United States into a giant police state.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The states must push back!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Not only must states reclaim millions of acres of land within their borders that are now controlled by the federal government, they must also pass legislation requiring federal bureaucracies such as the BLM to obtain the consent of county sheriffs in order to execute arrest warrants. States must make it clear in unmistakable terms that only the U.S. Marshals Service may execute federal warrants within their states; otherwise, only the county sheriff is authorized to execute arrest warrants within their states.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Furthermore, the U.S. Congress needs to disarm the countless federal bureaucracies that are currently terrorizing the American people. In truth, very few federal agencies need to carry guns. The politicians in Washington, D.C., love to try to disarm the American people, but the ones they should be disarming are most of the federal alphabet agencies.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Why do employees of the federal Department of Education need to carry guns? Why do postal employees need to carry guns? Why do agents of the BLM need to carry guns? Why do employees at NASA need to carry guns? Why do employees of the EPA need to carry guns? Why do employees at NOAA need to carry guns? Why do employees of the National Weather Service need to carry guns? Why do employees of the Social Security Administration need to carry guns? Why do employees at the Department of Agriculture need to carry guns? Why do employees of the National Marine Fisheries Service need to carry guns?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Ladies and gentlemen, law enforcement is mostly the responsibility of State and local governments. Why are so many federal bureaucracies carrying guns? Agencies of the federal government are not soldiers; and they are not even policemen. Furthermore, the American people are not the enemy!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Pat Buchanan is right: had not BLM agents marched onto the Bundy ranch like Nazi Stormtroopers, none of the events that are still playing out in the Nevada desert would have taken place. The memory of Waco and Ruby Ridge are still very vivid in the collective memory of the people of the United States. If anything burns deep in our collective conscience, it is that THERE MUST NEVER AGAIN BE ANOTHER WACO OR RUBY RIDGE. And that is exactly why those Americans have put themselves between the federal government and the Bundy family down in Bunkerville, Nevada.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The events in Salt Lake City, Utah, conducted by dozens of legislators from the western states last Friday were as monumental as the events in Bunkerville, Nevada, conducted by the citizen militia the previous Saturday.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Free and independent states and “We the People” have always been the guardians of liberty in this land. And if freedom is going to be preserved for our posterity, it is going to take the combined effort of both the individual sovereign states and individual citizens to arise and stand in the gap once again. It would also seem that the rise has already begun. Praise God! The only thing missing now is the patriot pulpit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">P.S. I have been inundated with requests from pastors and laymen alike to help them establish non-501c3, unaffiliated, unorganized, unincorporated churches. I have heard their pleas; and I have a very important announcement regarding this matter coming in the very near future. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>The freedom of the press and the freedom of religion are two of the most important elements of a free society. These were so important to America’s Founding Fathers that they were protected in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A free and independent press serves as watchdogs for liberty, while a free and independent church serves as watchmen for liberty. Sadly, both watchdog and watchman are, for the most part, missing in today’s America.</p>
<p>Just about everyone knows that the vast majority of the national press corps has a strong liberal bias. That’s a given. But, it’s actually worse than that. Instead of being watchdogs on the government, the mainstream media has become little more than lap dogs for the government. Instead of reporting the truth, most of the media is actually more concerned with covering up the truth. With precious few exceptions, investigative reporting is dead in the national news media.</p>
<p>Oh, sure. Republican administrations are depicted more negatively by the mainstream media than are Democrat administrations. No doubt about that. Can anyone recall the media hoopla over Vice President Dan Quayle’s misspelling of the word “potato”? The liberal media talked about that almost nonstop for months. But did you hear much of anything when President Barack Obama recently misspelled the word “respect”? I mean from media sources outside of FOX News? Nope. Nary a word.</p>
<p>But when it comes to investigating the truth behind what government spokesmen tell us, it doesn’t matter to a tinker’s dam whether it is a Republican or Democrat administration: about the only thing national newscasters know to do is to report whatever the official story of the government is. Once in a blue moon, a mainstream newspaper, such as the New York Times, will dare to print a report that questions an official government story, but not very often. And when such a report is printed, it digs only so deep. For the last several years, about the only major newspaper that has had the guts to actually do some real investigative reporting is the London Guardian. Even the Washington Times prints mostly milquetoast exposés.</p>
<p>CBS reporter, Sharly Attkisson, recently left the network due to its liberal bias and aversion to investigative reporting. Politico said this about Attkisson’s leaving: “Attkisson, who has been with CBS News for two decades, had grown frustrated with what she saw as the network’s liberal bias, an outsize influence by the network’s corporate partners and a lack of dedication to investigative reporting, several sources said. She increasingly felt that her work was no longer supported and that it was a struggle to get her reporting on air.”</p>
<p>See the Politico report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fblogs%2Fmedia%2F2014%2F03%2Fsharyl-attkisson-to-leave-cbs-news-184836.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG69XPKd5HQAEFkTxHjTfsYx1S_7Q" target="_blank">Sharyl Attkisson Resigns From CBS News</a></p>
<p>In an interview with the CBS affiliate in Philadelphia, Chris Stigall reported, “Responding to comments regarding a Phoenix television reporter yesterday who initially claimed that the White House pre-screens questions from reporters, Attkisson said, ‘I wouldn’t [be] surprised if sometimes there is that level of cooperation with some questions. If I need something answered from the White House and they won’t tell me, I’ll call our White House Correspondent. They’re friendlier with the White House Correspondents in general. So the White House Correspondent may ask Jay Carney or one of his folks about an issue and they will be told “ask that at the briefing and we’ll answer it.” They want to answer it in front of everybody. They do know it’s coming and they’ll call on you. There’s that kind of coordination sometimes. I wouldn’t be shocked if there’s sometimes more coordination. I don’t think it’s everybody on every briefing, every day. I’m pretty sure it’s not. But I think people would be surprised at the level of cooperation reporters have in general with politicians.’”</p>
<p>See Stigall’s report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fphiladelphia.cbslocal.com%2F2014%2F03%2F21%2Fsharyl-attkisson-there-is-coordination-between-reporters-and-politicians%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZjckKYKULZiJS9dpCDh8KSMwr9g" target="_blank">Sharyl Attkisson: There Is Coordination Between Reporters And Politicians</a></p>
<p>Attkisson was putting it very mildly. There is more than just coordination going on between the federal government and the national news media; it’s more like coziness and calculated manipulation.</p>
<p>Since when has the major media dared to investigate and report the truth regarding any of the major events that have transpired in this country? The last time there was even a semblance of genuine investigative reporting seen in the national press corps was during the Watergate scandal when Richard Nixon was President&#8211;and that was politically-motivated from start to finish.</p>
<p>The mainstream media didn’t bother to seriously investigate Ruby Ridge or Waco or the Oklahoma City bombing or TWA Flight 800 or the Sandy Hook shootings or (and especially) the attacks which occurred on 9/11/01. These events took place with both Republicans and Democrats at the helm: it didn’t matter. Government spokesmen gave the media the official story, and the media repeatedly regurgitated the official story until anyone who dared to question the official story was turned into a conspiracy nut. That’s not reporting the news, folks. That is manipulating the news to disseminate propaganda. Joseph Goebbels had nothing on the major media in America today.</p>
<p>Again, the modern American media are not watchdogs over government; they are lap dogs for government. Reporters who try to truly dig and investigate are seldom rewarded&#8211;just the opposite. Their stories are buried&#8211;if published at all. They are disinvited from interviewing notable dignitaries. They are passed over for promotions&#8211;or even dismissed. It doesn’t take people in the news business long to get the message that if they want to go anywhere, they must toe the line and become good little puppets. The First Amendment freedom of the press has been negated by the press itself.</p>
<p>Likewise, the First Amendment freedom of religion has also been negated. A free and independent clergy is essential to the maintenance of liberty. But, for the most part, America has not had a free and independent clergy in decades.</p>
<p>The IRS 501c3 designation for churches, along with State incorporation, has turned America’s watchmen into little more than glorified CEOs. The average pulpit is just as politically correct as the national news media. Plus, the average church is as much about the bottom line as news shows.</p>
<p>Did you know that there used to be a time when the major television networks expected that their news shows would not operate in the black financially? It’s true. Back then, it was more important that news shows reported and investigated the news than turn a profit. Therefore, corporate donations and government chagrin had little impact upon newscasters and reporters. Those days are long gone.</p>
<p>By the same token, did you know that there used to be a time in this country when most of our pastors and ministers (regardless of denomination) were more concerned about being Biblically correct than being politically correct? For example, so prominent was the role that Presbyterian pastors played in the American Revolution that as news of the rebellion spread throughout England, Horace Walpole told his fellow members of the British Parliament, “There is no use crying about it. Cousin America has run off with a Presbyterian parson, and that is the end of it.” Of course, Presbyterians were not the only clergymen in Colonial America to champion the cause of liberty and independence from behind their pulpits.</p>
<p>In truth, if it wasn’t for clergymen such as John Leland (along with political statesmen such as Patrick Henry, of course), it is doubtful that there would even be a First Amendment&#8211;or the rest of the Bill of Rights, for that matter.</p>
<p>But, back then, pastors were not motivated by the desire to build big buildings or impress political potentates or climb ecclesiastical elevators. They were motivated by courage and commitment. And you could tell it every time you went to church. They didn’t mince words; and their sermons seldom concluded in less than an hour. They were watchmen.</p>
<p>Sadly, in the same manner in which the national news media have abandoned their responsibility as America’s watchdogs, so, too, the vast majority of pastors have abandoned their responsibility as America’s watchmen. The First Amendment protection of the freedom of the press and religion is not enough to protect the freedom of the press and religion from themselves.</p>
<p>To be sure, many of our pastors and ministers today are sincere, compassionate, and honorable men. But they have never been taught the Biblical principles of liberty; they have never been taught how to apply the liberty principles of Scripture to our everyday lives&#8211;including our political lives; they have never been taught the true meaning of Biblical submission in general and Romans 13 in particular. However, more and more of these men are coming awake to these things. Of course, others stubbornly refuse to even consider the truth of these matters.</p>
<p>But, listen up, folks! Truth will always find a way to reveal itself: the dear Lord will make sure of that. As the mainstream media became toadies of Big Government, along came independent radio talk shows, newspapers, and the Internet. And in all likelihood, more people are getting their news and information from online sources today than from network or cable news shows. As a result, more and more people are awakening to the truth every day.</p>
<p>And, by the same token, as many establishment churches and pastors have become toadies of the IRS and political correctness, new, independent, unorganized, non-501c3 churches and fellowships are sprouting up all over America. Some of these groups are led by ministers whom God has led out of the establishment church. Others are led by laymen who have likewise left the establishment church. I hear from these people every day. And, by the grace of God, I hope to be more personally involved in helping Christian people around the country form liberty-oriented churches. More on that soon.</p>
<p>The First Amendment was designed to protect America’s watchdogs and watchmen. And it is a truism that there can never be a revival of liberty in this land without a resurrection of our watchdogs and watchmen. The good news is that resurrection is already taking place.</p>

<p>It should be obvious that the recent putsch and regime change in the Ukraine inspired and backed by the U.S. shadow government, benefits the international banksters. For the average EU resident, only further economic displacement and diminished prospects can be expected from any inclusion of Ukraine into the EU dictatorial structure. Not so, for the corporatists who expects expanded opportunities as <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/03/16/corporate-interests-behind-ukraine-putsch/">Consortium News</a> analyzes agricultural and energy companies recent involvement within the Ukraine.While corporatists want to extend their monopolies, the appeal of joining the EU with privileges of travel, relocation and better employment, has a very high price tag. So what is really behind the cover that the Brussels technocrats like to provide for the heavy hand treatment, which the banksters always demand? Look to the methods of the IMF for part of the answer.</p>
<p>Michel Chossudovsky of Global Research, in the detailed essay <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/regime-change-in-ukraine-and-the-imfs-bitter-economic-medicine/5374877">Regime Change in Ukraine and the IMF’s Bitter &#8220;Economic Medicine&#8221;</a>, gives a comprehensive account of the handpicked players that are eager to do the bidding of the IMF.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shortly after his instatement, the interim (puppet) prime minister Arseny Yatsenyuk casually dismissed the need to negotiate with the IMF. Prior to the conduct of negotiations pertaining to a draft agreement, Yatsenyuk had already called for an unconditional acceptance of the IMF package: &#8220;We have no other choice but to accept the IMF offer&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explains the methods of the standard game plan that the IMF uses to impoverish the peasants and steal assets and resources.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While the privatization program ensures the transfer of State assets into the hands of foreign investors, the IMF program also includes provisions geared towards the destabilization of the country’s privately owned business conglomerates. A concurrent &#8220;break up&#8221; plan entitled &#8220;spin-off&#8221; as well as a &#8220;bankruptcy program&#8221; are often implemented with a view to triggering the liquidation, closing down or restructuring of a large number of nationally owned private and public enterprises.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the 21th Century Newswire reports that the <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2014/03/21/the-latest-heist-us-quietly-snatches-the-ukraines-gold-reserves/">US Quietly Snatches the Ukraine’s Gold Reserves</a> and corroborated by the same <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/ukraines-gold-reserves-secretely-flown-out-and-confiscated-by-the-new-york-federal-reserve/5373446">Prof Chossudovsky</a>, it becomes clear that economic conquest is a prime component behind the staged coup.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to reports out of Kiev, the US has quietly transfers 33 tons of Ukrainian gold out of the country and back to vaults in the US. Presumably, this sovereign wealth transfer would be counted as partial &#8220;collateral&#8221; for a fresh round of IMF, US FED, and ECB paper debt that is currently being organized for dumping into the Ukraine’s economic black hole.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Later a returned call from a senior official of the former Ministry of Revenue reported that tonight, on the orders of one of the new leaders of Ukraine, the United States had taken custody of all the gold reserves in Ukraine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, economist Michael Hudson in <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/03/ukraine-will-benefit-imf-bailout.html">Who In Ukraine Will Benefit From An IMF Bailout?</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The objective of IMF loans is to deindustrialize the economy. It is to force the economy–meaning the government when you say the economy–the government has to pay the IMF loan by privatizing whatever remains in the public domain. The Westerners want to buy the Ukrainian farmland. They want to buy the public utilities. They want to buy the roads. They want to buy the ports. And all of this is going to be sold at a very low price to the Westerners, and the price that the Westerners pay will be turned over to the Ukrainian government, that then will turn it back to the Ukraine. So whatever the West gives Ukraine will immediately be taken back.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Xc0wjU1gShE" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch the informative video, <a href="http://youtu.be/Xc0wjU1gShE">Who In Ukraine Will Benefit From An IMF Bailout?</a>, for the Real News assessment, that clarifies these developments. Now shift to the recent announcement that the <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/eu-russia-ukraine/25304480.html">EU Signs Association Agreement With Ukraine</a> for a viewpoint reported by Radio Free Europe.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This deal covers the most existential and most important issues, mainly security and defense cooperation,&#8221; Yatsenyukd said. &#8220;This deal will establish a joint decision-making body, which is to facilitate the process of real reforms in my country. And this deal meets the aspirations of millions of Ukrainians that want to be a part of the European Union.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What exactly can the EU offer by way of defense cooperation? Yes, this is the same central banker stooge, who the Wall Street Journal describes as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2014/02/27/washingtons-man-yatsenyuk-setting-ukraine-up-for-ruin/">Washington&#8217;s Man Yatsenyuk Setting Ukraine Up For Ruin</a>. Without the United States, the EU is a paper tiger. NATO is not an alliance, but a branch of outposts to deploy American troops. How does this phony agreement between the EU and Ukraine help the economic interests of either party?</p>
<p>Such a display of destitution only makes the illegitimate installed Ukraine government look like the vassal state that it has become. Bob Livingston over at <a href="http://personalliberty.com/2014/03/24/war-is-becoming-a-tough-sell/">Personal Liberty Digest</a> has it correct, &#8220;The Ukraine situation is a bankster-orchestrated crisis with the short game more money printing and the end game global governance.&#8221;The EU governance aspect is the eventual goal, but the immediate economic dislocation that even the talk of sanctions against Russia has, with the trading partners within the EU, surely will experience real pain. These conditions create the perfect storm for the IMF banksters to apply their vile craft.</p>
<p>Now that the Ukraine is reduced to beggar status, the gang of approved corporatist will feast like vultures upon the remains of fire sale assets. Once again the formula imposed upon Ireland, Spain and certainly <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/110611.html">Greece</a>, will be used to guarantee the billions in EURO credit that will flow into the secret bank accounts of the new junta.</p>
<p>Capturing the Ukraine is more about geopolitical asset thievery than assimilation into the European Union. However, the EU marketed, as a lawful &#8220;community of nations&#8221; is nothing more than the political front for the money counterfeiters. Fashioning economic distress is the business of the unholy alliance. NATO, the IMF and the EU serve the shyster and shylock central banking system. Ukraine is just the latest victim.</p>

<p><em>As the US and EU apply sanctions on Russia over its annexation’ of Crimea, JP Sottile reveals the corporate annexation of Ukraine. For Cargill, Chevron, Monsanto, there’s a gold mine of profits to be made from agri-business and energy exploitation.</em></p>
<p>On 12th January 2014, a <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-ukraine-anti-government-protesters-stage-first-mass-rally-of-2014/1828480.html" target="_blank">reported 50,000 <em>“pro-Western”</em> Ukrainians</a>descended upon Kiev’s Independence Square to protest against the government of President Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>Stoked in part by <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/140112/ukraine-protests-swell-after-prominent-opposition-leaders-beatin" target="_blank">an attack on opposition leader Yuriy Lutsenko</a>, the protest marked the beginning of the end of Yanukovych’s four year-long government.</p>
<p>That same day, the <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8dde553c-7b92-11e3-84af-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2vmwKJHNH" target="_blank"><em>Financial Times</em>reported</a> a major deal for US agribusiness titan <strong>Cargill</strong>.</p>
<h4>Business confidence never faltered</h4>
<p>Despite the turmoil within Ukrainian politics after Yanukovych rejected a major trade deal with the European Union <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-ukraine-eu-idUSBRE9AK0S220131121" target="_blank">just seven weeks earlier</a>, Cargill was confident enough about the future to fork over $200 million to buy a stake in Ukraine’s UkrLandFarming.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, UkrLandFarming is the world’s eighth-largest land cultivator and <a title="Ukraine eggmaker's hard-boiled expansion plan — FT.com" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/591e3156-3d8e-11e3-9928-00144feab7de.html" target="_blank">second biggest egg producer</a>. And those aren’t the only eggs in Cargill’s increasingly ample basket.</p>
<p>On 13th December 2013, Cargill announced the <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/cargill-buys-stake-in-novorossiysk-port-to-boost-black-sea-presence/491486.html" target="_blank">purchase of a stake in a Black Sea grain terminal</a> at Novorossiysk on Russia’s Black Sea coast.</p>
<p>The port — to the east of Russia’s strategically and historically important Crimean naval base — gives them a major entry-point to Russian markets and adds them to the list of Big Ag companies <a href="http://www.agrimoney.com/news/cargill-extends-spree-of-black-sea-port-deals--6589.html" target="_blank">investing in ports around the Black Sea</a>, both in Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Cargill has been in Ukraine for <a href="http://www.cargill.com/worldwide/ukraine/" target="_blank">over two decades</a>, investing in grain elevators and acquiring a major <a href="http://www.cargill.com/feed/brands/provimi/" target="_blank">Ukrainian animal feed company</a> in 2011. And, based on its investment in UkrLandFarming, Cargill was decidedly confident amidst the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/europe/protests-continue-as-ukraine-leader-defends-stance-on-europe.html" target="_blank">post-EU deal chaos</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a stark juxtaposition to the alarm bells ringing out from the US media, bellicose politicians on Capitol Hill and perplexed policymakers in the White House.</p>
<h4>Instability?… What Instablility?</h4>
<p>It’s even starker when compared to the anxiety expressed by Morgan Williams, President and CEO of the <a href="http://www.usubc.org/site/" target="_blank">US-Ukraine Business Council</a> — which, according to its website, has been<em>“promoting US-Ukraine business relations since 1995.”</em></p>
<p>Williams was interviewed by the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/westerners-know-very-little-about-ukraine-qa-us-ukraine-business-council-president-1561143" target="_blank"><em>International Business Times</em></a> on March 13 and, despite Cargill’s demonstrated willingness to spend, he said, <em>“The instability has forced businesses to just go about their daily business and not make future plans for investment, expansion and hiring more employees.”</em></p>
<p>In fact, Williams, who does double-duty as Director of Government Affairs at the private equity firm <a href="http://www.sigmableyzer.com/" target="_blank">SigmaBleyzer</a>, claimed, <em>“Business plans have been at a standstill.”</em></p>
<p>Apparently, he wasn’t aware of Cargill’s investment, which is odd given the fact that he could’ve simply called Van A. Yeutter, Vice President for Corporate Affairs at Cargill, and asked him about his company’s quite active business plan.</p>
<p>There is little doubt Williams has the phone number because Mr. Yuetter serves on <a href="http://www.usubc.org/site/u-s-ukraine-business-council-usubc-executive-committee" target="_blank">the Executive Committee</a> of the selfsame US-Ukraine Business Council. It’s quite a cozy investment club, too.</p>
<p>According to his <a href="http://www.sigmableyzer.com/who-we-are/our-people/morgan-williams" target="_blank">SigmaBleyzer profile</a>, Williams <em>“started his work regarding Ukraine in 1992″</em> and has since advised American agribusinesses <em>“investing in the former Soviet Union.”</em> As an experienced fixer for Big Ag, he must be fairly friendly with the folks on the Executive Committee.</p>
<h4>Big Ag Luminaries — Monsanto, Eli Lilly, Dupont, John Deere…</h4>
<p>And what a committee it is — it’s a veritable who’s who of Big Ag. Among the luminaries working tirelessly and no doubt selflessly for a better, freer Ukraine are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Melissa Agustin, Director, International Government Affairs &amp; Trade for <strong>Monsanto</strong>;</li>
<li>Brigitte Dias Ferreira, Counsel, International Affairs for <strong>John Deere</strong>;</li>
<li>Steven Nadherny, Director, Institutional Relations for agriculture equipment-maker<strong>CNH Industrial</strong>;</li>
<li>Jeff Rowe, Regional Director for <strong>DuPont Pioneer</strong>;</li>
<li>John F. Steele, Director, International Affairs for <strong>Eli Lilly &amp; Company</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, Cargill’s Van A. Yeutter. But Cargill isn’t alone in their warm feelings toward Ukraine. As <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/24/monsanto-ukraine-idUSL5N0E51CM20130524" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a> in May 2013, Monsanto — the largest seed company in the world — plans to build a $140 million <em>“non-GM (genetically modified) corn seed plant in Ukraine.”</em></p>
<p>And right after the decision on the EU trade deal, Jesus Madrazo, Monsanto’s Vice President for Corporate Engagement, <a href="http://monsantoblog.com/2013/12/19/monsanto-and-its-commitment-to-ukraine/" target="_blank">reaffirmed</a> his company’s <em>“commitment to Ukraine”</em>and <em>“the importance of creating a favorable environment that encourages innovation and fosters the continued development of agriculture.”</em></p>
<p>Monsanto’s strategy includes a little <em>“hearts and minds”</em> public relations, too. On the heels of Mr. Madrazo’s reaffirmation, <a href="http://monsantoblog.com/2013/12/13/monsanto-ukraine-launching-social-development-program/" target="_blank">Monsanto announced</a> <em>“a social development program titled ‘Grain Basket of the Future’ to help rural villagers in the country improve their quality of life.”</em></p>
<p>The initiative will dole out grants of up to $25,000 to develop programs providing<em>“educational opportunities, community empowerment, or small business development.”</em></p>
<h4>Immense Economic Importance</h4>
<p>The well-crafted moniker ‘Grain Basket of the Future’ is telling because, once upon a time, Ukraine was known as ‘the breadbasket’ of the Soviet Union. The <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html" target="_blank">CIA ranks</a> Soviet-era Ukraine second only to Mother Russia as the <em>“most economically important component of the former Soviet Union.”</em></p>
<p>In many ways, the farmland of Ukraine was the backbone of the USSR. Its fertile black soil generated over a quarter of the USSR’s agriculture. It exported substantial quantities of food to other republics and its farms generated four times the output of the next-ranking republic.</p>
<p>Although Ukraine’s agricultural output plummeted in the first decade after the break-up of the Soviet Union, the farming sector has been growing spectacularly in recent years.</p>
<p>While Europe struggled to shake-off the Great Recession, Ukraine’s agriculture sector grew 13.7% in 2013.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s agriculture economy is hot. Russia’s is not. Hampered by the effects of <a href="http://www.fwi.co.uk/articles/09/12/2013/142338/the-future-of-farming-in-russia.htm" target="_blank">climate change</a> and <a href="http://www.fwi.co.uk/articles/09/12/2013/142338/the-future-of-farming-in-russia.htm" target="_blank">25 million hectares</a> of uncultivated agricultural land, Russia lags behind its former breadbasket.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2014-02-07/transformation-agriculture-ukraine-collective-farms-to" target="_blank">According to the Centre for Eastern Studies</a>, Ukraine’s agricultural exports rose from $4.3 billion in 2005 to $17.9 billion in 2012 and, harkening the heyday of the USSR, farming currently accounts for 25% of its total exports. Ukraine is also the world’s third-largest exporter of wheat and of corn. And corn is not just food. It is also ethanol.</p>
<h4>Feeding Europe</h4>
<p>But people gotta eat — particularly in Europe. As Frank Holmes of US Global Investors<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-is-quickly-becoming-the-breadbasket-of-europe-2011-2" target="_blank">assessed in 2011</a>, Ukraine is poised to become Europe’s butcher. Meat is difficult to ship, but Ukraine is perfectly located to satiate Europe’s hunger.</p>
<p>Just two days after Cargill bought into UkrLandFarming, <em>Global Meat News</em> <a href="http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Industry-Markets/Ukraine-forecasts-significant-rise-in-meat-exports" target="_blank">reported a huge forecasted spike</a> in <em>“all kinds”</em> of Ukrainian meat exports, with an increase of 8.1% overall and staggering 71.4% spike in pork exports.</p>
<p>No wonder Eli Lilly is represented on the US-Ukraine Business Council’s Executive Committee. Its <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/13/usa-elanco-price-increase-idUSL2N0IY23320131113" target="_blank">Elanco Animal Health unit</a> is a major manufacturer of feed supplements.</p>
<p>And it is also notable that Monsanto’s planned seed plant is non-GMO, perhaps anticipating an emerging GMO-unfriendly European market and Europe’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/13/organic-food-drink-sale" target="_blank">growing appetite</a> for organic foods. When it comes to Big Ag’s profitable future in Europe, the stakes couldn’t be higher.</p>
<h4>A Long String of Russian Losses</h4>
<p>For Russia and its hampered farming economy, it’s another in a long string of losses to US encroachment — from NATO expansion into Eastern Europe to US military presence to its south and onto a major shale gas development deal recently signed by Chevron in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So, why was Big Ag so bullish on Ukraine, even in the face of so much uncertainty and the predictable reaction by Russia?</p>
<p>The answer is that the seeds of Ukraine’s turn from Russia have been sown for the last two decades by the persistent Cold War alliance between corporations and foreign policy. It’s a version of the ‘<a href="http://billmoyers.com/episode/the-deep-state-hiding-in-plain-sight/" target="_blank">Deep State</a>‘ that is usually associated with the oil and defense industries, but also exists in America’s other heavily subsidized industry — agriculture.</p>
<p>Morgan Williams is at the nexus of Big Ag’s alliance with US foreign policy. To wit,<a href="http://www.sigmableyzer.com/who-we-are/our-people/morgan-williams" target="_blank">SigmaBleyzer touts</a> Mr. Williams’ work with <em>“various agencies of the US government, members of Congress, congressional committees, the Embassy of Ukraine to the US, international financial institutions, think tanks and other organizations on US-Ukraine business, trade, investment and economic development issues.”</em></p>
<h4>Freedom — For US Business</h4>
<p>As President of the US-Ukraine Business Council, Williams has access to Council cohort — David Kramer, President of <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/country/ukraine#.UyM09ye57dI" target="_blank">Freedom House</a>. Officially a non-governmental organization, it has been <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/ngo432.doc.htm" target="_blank">linked</a> with overt and <a href="http://exiledonline.com/wikileaks-expose-kochs-neocons-and-covert-regime-change-ops/" target="_blank">covert ‘democracy’ efforts</a> in places where the door isn’t open to American interests — aka US corporations.</p>
<p>Freedom House, the National Endowment for Democracy and National Democratic Institute <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa" target="_blank">helped fund and support</a> the Ukrainian ‘Orange Revolution’ in 2004. Freedom House is <a href="http://www.activistcash.com/organizations/503-freedom-house/" target="_blank">funded directly</a> by the US Government, the National Endowment for Democracy and the US Department of State.</p>
<p>David Kramer is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs and, according to his <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/content/kramer-david-j#.UyM-hye57dI" target="_blank">Freedom House bio page</a>, formerly a Senior Fellow at <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Project_for_the_New_American_Century" target="_blank">the Project for the New American Century</a>.</p>
<h4>Nuland’s $5 Billion For Ukrainian ‘Democracy’</h4>
<p>That puts Kramer and, by one degree of separation, Big Ag fixer Morgan Williams in the company of PNAC co-founder Robert Kagan who, as coincidence would have it, is married to Victoria <em>“F*ck the EU”</em> Nuland, the current Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Ms. Nuland spoke to the US-Ukrainian Foundation last 13th December, <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/2013/dec/218804.htm" target="_blank">extolling the virtues</a> of the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/euromaidan-dark-shadows-far-right-ukraine-protests-1556654" target="_blank">Euromaidan</a> movement as the embodiment of <em>“the principles and values that are the cornerstones for all free democracies.”</em></p>
<p>Nuland also told the group that the United States had invested more than $5 billion in support of Ukraine’s <em>“European aspirations”</em> — meaning pulling Ukraine away from Russia. She made her remarks on a dais featuring a backdrop emblazoned with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y0y-JUsPTU" target="_blank">a Chevron logo</a>.</p>
<p>Also, her colleague and phone call buddy US <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2325091/ukraine_chevron_condi_rice_and_shale_gas_join_the_dots.html" target="_blank">Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt helped Chevron</a> cook up their 50-year shale gas deal right in Russia’s kitchen.</p>
<h4>Coca-Cola, Exxon-Mobil, Raytheon</h4>
<p>Although Chevron sponsored that event, it is <a href="http://www.usukraine.org/funders2011.shtml" target="_blank">not listed as a supporter</a> of the Foundation. But the Foundation does list the <strong>Coca-Cola Company</strong>, <strong>ExxonMobil</strong> and <strong>Raytheon</strong> as major sponsors. And, to close the circle of influence, the US-Ukraine Business Council is also listed as a supporter.</p>
<p>Which brings the story back to Big Ag’s fixer — Morgan Williams.</p>
<p>Although he was glum about the current state of investment in Ukraine, he’s gotta wear shades when he looks into the future. He told <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/westerners-know-very-little-about-ukraine-qa-us-ukraine-business-council-president-1561143" target="_blank">the <em>International Business Times</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The potential here for agriculture / agribusiness is amazing … Production here could double. The world needs the food Ukraine could produce in the future. Ukraine’s agriculture could be a real gold mine.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, his priority is to ensure that the bread of well-connected businesses gets lavishly buttered in Russia’s former breadbasket. And there is no better connected group of Ukraine-interested corporations than <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304585004579417523345324430" target="_blank">American agribusiness</a>.</p>
<p>Given the extent of US official involvement in Ukrainian politics — including the interesting fact that Ambassador Pyatt <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/pyatt-us-agencies-assisting-ukraine-in-yanukovych-corruption-investigation-338953.html" target="_blank">pledged US assistance</a> to the new government in investigating and rooting-out corruption — Cargill’s seemingly risky investment strategy probably wasn’t that risky, after all.</p>

			<p><strong>President Assad and Ayatollah Khomeini are keeping their word. Will President Obama keep his?</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/chemicalweaponssyria3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>Recent reports from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the accuracy of which have been conceded by the White House, but denied in Tel Aviv, have it that slightly less than half of Syria’s chemical weapons have already left the country and 100% of the country’s stockpiles are believed to have been neutralized. Well along the path to meet the June 30 agreed discard date.</p>
<p>Both Iran and Russia have been credited with helping persuade the Syrian government that it is very much in the interest of Syria as well as the global community to discard its chemical weapons stockpiles which date back to the 1970s. A total of 11 consignments have been recently shipped out of Syria for decontamination and disposal, the latest from Latakia. Included is all of Syria&#8217;s sulphur mustard gas, a blister agent that was first widely used in WWI. </p>
<p> Captain Clyde Chester Lamb, the father of this observer, was a one of hundreds of victims of the deadly gas while fighting the Germans in front-line trenches in eastern France. Capt. Lamb survived, but never fully recovered, and when he did later speak about his experiences in the war, which was not often, he once told his horrified children at story time that he and his comrades had no gas masks so they used to improvise by urinating on scraps of uniforms which he would distribute to his men with instructions to hold it tightly over their nose and mouth. Somehow their pee seemed to reduce the effects of the poisonous gas.</p>
<p>Despite some delays due to security and logistical issues, few besides the Zionist lobby in the US Congress doubt that Syria’s work will be completed. Across Syria, according to information made available to this observer, specialists have accelerated the packing and transporting of the chemical weapons, sometimes even moving them through rebel territory to the Mediterranean port of Latakia. </p>
<p> In cooperation with Iran, Russia has supplied large-capacity containers and armored vehicles for the Latakia loading operation while China has sent 10 ambulances and surveillance cameras and Finland dispatched an emergency response team in case of accidents. Denmark and Norway are providing cargo ships and military escorts to take the chemicals to the container port of Gioia Tauro in Italy and the American government, among others, is also helping.</p>
<p>Despite Iranian cooperation with this major humanitarian project and, according to IAEA spokesmen, “solid progress has been made with the Iranian nuclear file”, the White House to date is still waffling on its pledged meager lifting of sanctions which continue to target the people of Iran. US sanctions also continue to compound and increase the nearly unfathomable suffering of the Syrian people all of whom have been targeted by Barack Obama Executive Orders ever tightening their noose of economic sanctions.<br />
The White House has yet to explain its dilatoriness, but Congressional sources report that President Obama is still being targeted by Israel and its Congressional agents and that Obama does not yet want to lift sanctions “for now”, more than cosmetically.  This applies to medicine and medical equipment. The same source claims that the White House is also signaling Tehran that it should continue to be patient while a sanctions review is getting started in Washington.Meanwhile,  US Secretary of State  Kerry has just  assured Iran’s leadership that the White House appreciates the fatwa (religious decree) issued by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  last month forbidding the production and use of nuclear weapons. Kerry agreed that Iran is entitled to a peaceful nuclear program and he also credited the earlier statement by Iran’s Foreign Ministry Spokes Ramin Mehman-Parast that Ayatollah Khamenei’s fatwa is binding for Iran, and that “There is nothing more important in defining the framework for our nuclear activities than the Leader’s fatwa.”</p>
<p>A recent Office of Financial Assets Control (OFAC) prosecution of an American citizen seeking to ship potentially life-saving MRI medical equipment to Iran illustrates the weak knees of the Obama White House by allowing that Zionist dominated Federal agency to ramp up its targeting of the people of Iran.</p>
<p>There are dozens of cases like the one noted below and President Obama is presumably aware of them.  The shameful case under review involves a University Medical Researcher who is being targeting with jail time for sending a medical device to Iran which his lawyers argued was completely innocent and clearly legal because medical equipment such as MRI’s are exempted by the  ‘ humanitarian exceptions’ stated in Obama’s  relevant Executive Orders imposing US sanctions against Iran.</p>
<p>Mr. Cliff Burns, a lawyer and law professor in Washington DC explained the case of Mr.Mohamad Nazemzadeh, who was a Research Fellow in the Neurology Department of the University of Michigan at the time of his arrest, and who is being federally prosecuted for sending a medical device to the Netherlands. At issue is a coil for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. The coil is the assembly of wires that generates the necessary radio signals when electricity flows through them to permit imaging the part of the body within the coil. Mr. Nazemzadeh is currently doing research at the Henry Ford hospital in Detroit and his area of specialty is, not surprisingly, magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
<p> As explained by Mr. Burns, “A part for an MRI machine would, under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, be eligible for an export license notwithstanding the embargo on Iran. Nazemzadeh’s failure to obtain a license would, of course, be a violation of the embargo.”  Even assuming that it was a technical criminal violation in his case, one has to wonder why, as Burns does, Obama Administration prosecutorial resources are being consumed to prosecute a researcher for trying to send life-saving medical equipment to Iran. As one of the researchers lawyers noted: “Aren’t there dangerous people out there with guns and bombs who might warrant the attention instead?”</p>
<p>An affidavit in support of a search warrant for Nazemzadeh’s mobile phone casts doubt on whether Nazemzadeh actually had the criminal intent necessary to support an OFAC pushed criminal prosecution in the first place for the attempted export of the MRI part. According to the affidavit, Nazemzadeh was negotiating with the undercover federal agent sent in by OFAC to ship the MRI coil to Iran through a company in the Netherlands. It is not uncommon for people to believe, even if they study the vague wording of the Iranian sanction minutia, that if it is legal to ship an item to a particular country, no laws are broken if the item is then re-exported, without any involvement on their part, to a prohibited destination. Here, according to the affidavit, Mr. Nazemzadeh continued to say to the undercover agent that he believed the transaction was legal and says this is true because the export from the United States is to the Netherlands, not Iran.  Mr. Nazemzadeh’s good faith legal mistake is not a criminal act. Instead, this is precisely the sort of case that ought to be evaluated, if at all, as an administrative matter by OFAC, were that Muslim targeting agency anywhere near fair-minded and objective. OFAC should have at the maximum issued a fine in this case notwithstanding Mr. Nazemzadeh’s mistaken belief that the transaction did not violate U.S. law.</p>
<p>If the White House truly wants to normalize relations with Iran and with Syria as it claims, it needs to do a lot better. A good start would be by calling off OFACs attack dogs who service other than the American people. Also it should honor its oft touted “Humanitarian sanctions against Iran and Syria that exempts medicines and medical equipment”.  This language has not been implemented and it misleads the global community about the brutal and illegal nature of the White House promulgated civilian targeting, for political purposes, sanctions.</p>
<p>This weekend’s White House greetings to the people of the Islamic Republic for Nowruz the Iranian New Year in the Solar Hijri calendar are no doubt sincere and appreciated.  But now it’s time to give substance to America’s New Year’s greetings that her citizens can be proud of and, that is accordant and consistent with their values.</p>
