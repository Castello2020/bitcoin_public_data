<p><strong>Unless you’ve been in an underground bunker for the last month, you’d have heard that the Ukraine has gone topsy-turvy lately.</strong></p>
<p>They seem to have escaped one old Soviet Union, only be reeled in by a new Soviet in the EU. There is also the problem of organized crime syndicates who have overrun the country.</p>
<p>Understanding the country’s recent history and following the money is important if you want to see which way the wind is blowing in Kiev…</p>
<p><strong>Stalin and Krushchev Wanted Ukraine</strong></p>
<p>For most Europeans, Ukraine is a gas transport corridor for bringing expensive Russian gas to Europe and Ukraine either overcharges Gazprom for gas transit fees, or does not pay Gazprom for the gas it takes for national consumption.</p>
<p>This Russian-Ukrainian gas game occasionally tips into gas embargoes – hitting consumers further down the line. As a geopolitical bargaining chip, conversely, Ukraine had considerable import  - <em>and weight</em> – during the Cold War period which tapered off in 1989-91. Relatively quickly, Russia withdrew “nearly all” of its nuclear-tipped missiles, atomic warheads and nuclear military equipment and component inventories from Ukraine, in the 1990s.</p>
<p>That said, Ukraine is listed by human rights and corruption watchdog NGOs as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, tied with Bangladesh, Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Syria.  Its postwar history following the defeat of Nazi Germany is a tragic story of Soviet megalomania, paranoia and oppression. The Nazi Germans probably killed about 15% of the total population, but about another 600,000 Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned in Soviet gulags or exiled to the eastern Soviet empire. Among their crimes was “non-performance” in agricultural output.</p>
<p>Administered by the rising political star and soon-to-be rival of Joseph Stalin, <strong>Nikita Khruschev</strong>, firstly in eastern Russian-speaking Ukraine, the kolkhoz collective-farm system was operated by chiefs selected by Khruschev. He empowered them to expel residents who “under-performed”. The kolkhoz chiefs quickly turned this into a racket protection and vendetta system for expelling their personal enemies, and the weak, the old and other “misfits”.  Well over 10,000 were exiled to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. For Khruschev, this was a highly effective policy which he recommended it for adoption across the USSR to Stalin, despite it periodically resulting in wide-area famines.</p>

<p>Similar to the <strong>“agro-towns”</strong> attempted by Ceaucescu of Romania, Khrushchev further destabilized Ukraine’s slowly recovering agricultural output with his scheme for population regrouping, which he later applied in Russia when he became <em>Praesidium</em> chief on the death of Stalin, following a classic Mafia-style power struggle with NKVD chief Beria. Beria was shot and killed with five of his associates by order of Khrushchev in Dec 1953. One of Beria’s proposed post-Stalin reform ideas was to liberate either or both East Germany and Ukraine, in exchange for cash payment by the West</p>
<p><strong>Crime Syndicates want Ukraine</strong></p>
<p>On the surface, mainstream media tells us today’s conflict in the Ukraine pitches the Russian-speaking half of the country in the east (where ailing president Yanukovich’s main support base is) against the more pro-Western, and alleged pro-EU, Ukrainian-speaking half in the west (where imprisoned Yulia Tymoshenko’s main support base is). More precisely, the Ukraine’s rapidly-deteriorating economic situation reflected by rapidly-rising interest rates on its sovereign debt bonds and Fitch’s recent downgrade, and its near-civil war street rebellion have reinforced its organized crime syndicates. Its organized criminals, and their enemies-and-allies in Russian, Bulgarian, Romanian and other east European organized crime syndicates, are vying for control of the State itself, to widen and deepen their lucrative activity.</p>
<p>The past week has seen President Yanukovych accept the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his cabinet, repeal anti-protest laws, provide an amnesty to detained protesters, and offer senior government jobs to the opposition – offers that were rejected. Moscow for its part has threatened it may hold back some or all of a promised Ukrainian bond-bailout package and a promised cut in gas prices for Ukraine until a new government is formed. The gas price cut and the loans, totalling $15bn (11 bn euros) were agreed in December, and widely seen as rewarding Yanukovich for Kiev’s rejection of an EU associate country deal for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukraine is one of six post-Soviet nations – along with  Belarus, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia – to be invited to cooperate with the EU within a new ‘multilateral’ framework that is high on promises but slim on content. The framework seeks visa-free travel, better human rights, more democracy, and respect for the principles of the market economy and sustainable development – so say the EU websites, but the single most important economic content is a trade pact aimed at cutting tariffs and taxes, which are in any case decreasing on the Ukrainian side due to its membership of the WTO since 2009. Main EU exports to Ukraine include medicine, motor vehicles, mobile phones and other manufactured goods, while main EU imports were of low to mid-value: iron and steel products, vegetable oils, ferro-nickel ores, iron ores and crude oil.</p>
<p>Acting long before the Ukraine’s membership of the WTO, or the 2008 financial crisis – both of which spurred and favoured crime syndicate integration in east Europe, Russia and the EU – the present number of organized crime groups operating in eastern Europe is estimated at about 3,600 with each profiting from such prosaic products as household detergents, to fake medecines, human trafficking, prostiution and the Ukrainian favorites of <em>hard drugs and firearms.</em>Rob Wainwright, director of the EU’s crime-fighting agency, told the Financial Times in June 2013 that only concerning Europe’s black market in counterfeit foodstuffs, fake pharmaceuticals and substandard machine parts, this doubled in value to about €2bn since 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Arms for Drugs and Arms for Cash</strong></p>
<p>From, at latest 2002, US drug enforcement and security agencies warned the Bush administration of the <strong>Kiev-Tel Aviv-New York</strong> <strong>“Axis”</strong> of organized crime operating drugs-for-arms trades worldwide. This syndicate particularly focuses South American-source cocaine supplied by Colombia’s FARC and other Andean country crime entities, and Ukraine-source weapons and military equipment. Ukraine’s geographic role and location as a “window to the southern states” of the ex-USSR, makes it highly favoured for operating drugs-for-arms trades, today. Land-route heroin from Afghanistan, South American cocaine and Russian AK47s are the hard currencies featured by this trade.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://static.c2w.com/uploads/question/image/01/48/72/63/N1487263/1387863030.jpg" width="250" height="201" /><br />
<em>Godfather of the AK47: Ukrainian Mikhail Kalashnikov.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Ukraine’s front-line status in the Cold War and its own arms-making industries made the country a major source for Russian licit and illicit arms exports, and Soviet-era materiel is still widely available. This ranges from the “iconic” AK47 rifle through to mines, grenades and military explosive-pyrotechnic devices, to night-sighting and communications equipment, and artillery pieces through the low-end range of 35mm-105mm, to also-iconic Soviet 72-ton T72 tanks, a highly depressed market where prices can be as low as scrap value only – about $3.50 per kilogram of weight.</p>
<p>Western security analysts, preferring not to have their names published, also point out that Ukraine is a “wonderland” of nuclear civil-military crossover materials and ordnance. Following the <strong>1986 Chernobyl meltdown</strong>, then the collapse and break up of the USSR in 1989-91, they say that large amounts of unaccounted-for nuclear fuel rods, wastes and nuclear military components exist in the country. They also underline the increased technological sophistication of ex-Soviet national mafias and their Middle Eastern opposite numbers, able to produce “binary nuclear” weapons, from nuclear and non-nuclear components, transported separately to reduce detection for final re-assembly when required.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s now accelerating political destabilization creates a classic poker-game challenge for Vladimir Putin at this time. He can act to prevent the country “seceding to the West’, or being partitioned into its western and eastern parts.</p>
<p>Whether Putin clamps down or lets the country fall apart, or the domestic power struggle inside Ukraine continues with no clear winner, the transition interval will certainly feature action by organized crime to further and deepen its already-strong foothold.</p>

<p><em>Does anyone in authority anywhere tell the truth about Fukushima? If there is any government or non-government authority in the world that is addressing the disaster at Fukushima openly, directly, honestly, and effectively, it’s not apparent to the outside observer what entity that might be.</em></p>
<p>There is instead an apparent global conspiracy of authorities of all sorts to deny to the public reliably accurate, comprehensible, independently verifiable (where possible), and comprehensive information about not only the condition of the Fukushima power plant itself and its surrounding communities, but about the unceasing, uncontrolled release of radioactive debris into the air and water, creating a constantly increasing risk of growing harm to the global community.</p>
<p>While the risk may still be miniscule in most places, the range of risk rises to lethal in Fukushima itself. With the radioactive waste of four nuclear reactors (three of them in meltdown) under uncertain control for almost three years now, the risk of lethal exposure is very real for plant workers, and may decrease with distance from the plant, but may be calculable for anyone on the planet. No one seems to know. No one seems to have done the calculation. No one with access to the necessary information (assuming it exists) seems to want to do the calculation.</p>
<p>There is no moral excuse for this international collusion. The excuses are political or economic or social, but none of them excuses any authority for withholding or lying about information that has potentially universal and destructive impact on everyone alive today and everyone to be born for some unknown generations.</p>
<p><a href="http://fairewinds.org/media/fairewinds-videos/arnie-comments-fukushima-foia-documents" target="_blank">Japanese authorities</a> may be the worst current offenders against the truth, as well as the health and safety of their people. Now the <a href="http://rt.com/news/japan-state-secrets-law-712/" target="_blank">Japanese government</a> has passed a harsh <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/12/31/258655342/japans-state-secrets-law-hailed-by-u-s-denounced-by-japanese" target="_blank">state secrets law</a> that threatens to reduce or eliminate reliable information about Fukushima. The U.S. government officially applauded this <a href="http://rt.com/news/japan-state-secrets-law-712/" target="_blank">heightened secrecy</a>, while continuing its own tight control on nuclear information. Japanese authorities are already <a href="http://fairewinds.org/media/fairewinds-videos/japanese-government-isnt-saying-fukushima" target="_blank">attacking their own people</a> in defense of nuclear power: not only under-measuring and ignoring varieties of radioactive threat, but even withholding the iodine pills in 2011 that might have mitigated the <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1388611/surge-cancers-among-young-fukushima-experts-divided-cause" target="_blank">growing epidemic</a> of thyroid issues today. Failing to confront Fukushima honestly, the Japanese are laying the basis for what could amount to a radiological sneak attack on the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Just because no one seems to know what to do about Fukushima is no excuse to go on lying about and/or denying the dimensions of reality, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, probably thousands of people with little or no authority who have long struggled to create a realistic, rational perspective on nuclear threats. The fundamental barrier to knowing the scale of the Fukushima disaster is just that: the scale of the Fukushima disaster.</p>
<h4>Chernobyl 1986 and Fukushima 2011 are Not Really Comparable</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant" target="_blank">Chernobyl</a> is the closest precedent to Fukushima, and it’s not very close. Chernobyl at the time of the 1986 electric failure and explosion had four operating reactors and two more under construction. The Chernobyl accident involved one reactor meltdown. Other reactors kept operating for some time after the accident. The rector meltdown was eventually entombed, containing the meltdown and reducing the risk. Until Fukushima, Chernobyl was considered the worst nuclear power accident in history, and it is still far from over (albeit largely contained for the time being). The Chernobyl <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone" target="_blank">Exclusion Zone</a> of roughly 1,000 square miles remains one of the most radioactive areas in the world and the clean-up is not even expected to be complete before 2065.</p>
<p>At the time of the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster" target="_blank">Fukushima plant</a> had six operating reactors. Three of them went into meltdown and a fourth was left with a heavily laden fuel pool teetering a hundred feet above the ground. Two other reactors were undamaged and have been shut down. Radiation levels remain lethal in each of the melted-down reactors, where the meltdowns appear to be held in check by water that is pumped into the reactors to keep them cool. In the process, the water gets irradiated and that which is not collected on site in leaking tanks flows steadily into the Pacific Ocean. Within the first two weeks, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20285-fukushima-radioactive-fallout-nears-chernobyl-levels.html?full=true&amp;print=true#.UsSYgmRDuVs" target="_blank">Fukushima radiation</a> was comparable to Chernobyl’s and while the levels have gone down, they remain elevated.</p>
<p>The plant’s corporate owner, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Electric_Power_Company" target="_blank">Tokyo Electric Power</a> Company (TEPCO), in turn effectively owned by the Japanese government after a <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/05/tepco%E2%80%99s-nationalisation" target="_blank">2012 nationalization</a>, began removing more than 1,500 <a href="http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/removal4u/index-e.html" target="_blank">fuel rod assemblies</a> from the teetering fuel pool in November, a delicate process expected to take a year or more. There are additional fuel pools attached to each of the melted down reactors and a much larger general fuel pool, all of which contain nuclear fuel rod assemblies that are secure only as long as TEPCO continues to cool them. The Fukushima Exclusion Zone, a 12-mile radius around the nuclear plant, is about 500 square miles (much of it ocean); little <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/return-to-the-radiation-zone-fukushima-cleanup-operation-mired-in-fear-and-misinformation-8810158.html" target="_blank">specific information</a> about the exclusion zone is easily available, but <a href="http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,2064134,00.html" target="_blank">media coverage</a> in the form of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/video/inside-japans-fukushima-exclusion-zone-15524477" target="_blank">disaster tourism</a> is plentiful, including a<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/imagery-on-google-maps-of-fukushima.html" target="_blank">Google Street View</a> interactive display.</p>
<p>Despite their significant differences as disasters, Chernobyl and Fukushima are both rated at 7 — a “major accident” on the International <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale" target="_blank">Nuclear Event Scale</a> designed in 1990 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That is the highest rating on the scale, a reflection of the inherent denial that colors most official nuclear thinking. Designed by nuclear “experts” after Chernobyl, the scale can’t imagine a worse accident than Chernobyl which, for all its intensity, was effectively over as an accident in a relatively short period of time. At Fukushima, by contrast, the initial set of events was less acute than Chernobyl, but almost three years later they continue without any resolution likely soon. Additionally Fukushima has three reactor meltdowns and thousands of precarious fuel rod assemblies in uncertain pools, any of which could produce a new crisis that would put Fukushima clearly off the scale.</p>
<p>And then there’s groundwater. Groundwater was not a problem at Chernobyl. Groundwater is a huge problem at the Fukushima plant that was built at the seashore, on a former riverbed, over an active aquifer. In a <a href="http://fairewinds.org/uncategorized/fukushima-daiichi-hard-clean" target="_blank">short video</a>, nuclear engineer Arnie Gunderson makes clear why groundwater makes Fukushima so hard to clean up, and why radiation levels there will likely remain dangerous for another hundred years.</p>
<h4>Fukushima Unit #3 Activity Led to Some Panic-Driven Reporting in 2013</h4>
<p>The Japanese government and nuclear power industry have a history of not telling the truth about nuclear accidents dating back at least to 1995, as reported by <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20263-japans-record-of-nuclear-coverups-and-accidents.html#.UsXbLmRDuVt" target="_blank"><em>New Scientist</em></a>and <a href="http://archives.politicususa.com/2011/03/15/rachel-maddow-japan-nuclear-2.html" target="_blank">Rachel Maddow</a>, among <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-17/japan-s-nuclear-disaster-caps-decades-of-faked-safety-reports-accidents.html" target="_blank">others</a>. Despite Japan’s history of nuclear dishonesty, Japanese authorities remain in total control of the Fukushima site and most of the information about it, without significant objection from most of the world’s governments, media, and other power brokers, whose reputation for honesty in nuclear matters is almost as bad as Japan’s. In such a context of no context, the public is vulnerable to <a href="http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/146-mjt" target="_blank">reports like this</a> from the <a href="http://turnerradionetwork.com/" target="_blank">Turner Radio Network</a> (TRN) on December 28:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/146-mjt" target="_blank">** NEWS FLASH — URGENT ** STEAM SUDDENLY EMANATING FROM FUKUSHIMA REACTOR # 3 — WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA SHOULD BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR POSSIBLE RADIATION CLOUD WITHIN 3 TO 5 DAYS</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fukushima-radiation-wind-trajectories.jpg" width="300" height="200" />Five days after this story was posted, the “radiation cloud” had not developed despite the story’s assertion that: “Experts say this could be the beginning of a  spent fuel pool criticality (meltdown)’involving up to 89 TONS of nuclear fuel burning up into the atmosphere and heading to North America.” The story named no “experts” and provided links only to TEPCO announcements in Japanese. The bulk of the story reads like an infomercial for “protective” gear of various sorts that TRN makes a point of saying it does NOT sell. Despite such obvious warning signs, others — such as <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2217953/fukushima_meltdown_mystery_steam_rising_over_reactor_3.html" target="_blank"><em>The Ecologist</em></a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/radioactive-mystery-steam-over-fukushima-could-mean-ano-1492280971" target="_blank"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> — reported the threat of “another meltdown” at Fukushima Unit #3 as imminent.</p>
<p>Clarification and reassurance quickly started chasing the “new meltdown” rumor around the Internet. <a href="http://enenews.com/steam-coming-from-fukushima-unit-3-reactor-building-observed-multiple-times-this-week" target="_blank"><em>ENENEWS</em></a> (Energy News) promptly posted the TEPCO reports in English, demonstrating that there was nothing “sudden” about the steam releases, they’ve been happening more or less daily since 2011, but condensation caused by cold weather makes them visible. At <a href="http://fairewinds.org/demystifying/fukushima-daiichi-unit-3-going-explode" target="_blank"><em>FAIREWINDS</em></a> (Energy Education), Arnie Gunderson posted on January 1:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“… the Internet has been flooded with conjecture claiming that Fukushima Daiichi Unit 3 is ready to explode… Our research, and discussions with other scientists, confirms that what we are seeing is a phenomenon that has been occurring at the Daiichi site since the March 2011 accident… While the plants are shutdown in nuke speak, there is no method of achieving cold shut down in any nuclear reactor. While the reactor can stop generating the actual nuclear chain reaction,<strong> the atoms left over from the original nuclear chain reaction continue to give off heat that is called the decay of the radioactive rubble (fission products)… constantly releasing moisture (steam) and radioactive products into the environment.” </strong></em>[emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fukushimaradiationmap3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>In other words, Fukushima Unit #3 continues to leak radioactivity into both air and water, as Units #1 and #2 presumably do as well. But as Gunderson explains, the level of radioactivity has declined sharply without becoming benign:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When Unit 3 was operating, it was producing more than 2,000 megawatts of heat from the nuclear fission process (chain reaction in the reactor). Immediately after the earthquake and tsunami, it shut down and the chain reaction stopped, but Unit 3 was still producing about 160 megawatts of decay heat. Now, 30 months later, it is still producing slightly less than 1 megawatt (one million watts) of decay heat… 1 megawatt of decay heat is a lot of heat even today, and it is creating radioactive steam, but it is not a new phenomenon.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h4>Reassurances About Fukushima are As Misleading As Scare Stories</h4>
<p>The reassuring aspects of the condition of Unit #3 — radioactive releases are not new, they’re less intense than they once were, the nuclear waste is cooling — while true enough, provide only a false sense of comfort. Also true: radiation is released almost continuously, the releases are uncontrolled, no one seems to be measuring the releases, no one seems to be tracking the releases, no one is assessing accumulation of the releases. And while it’s true that the waste is cooling and decaying, it’s also true that a loss of coolant could lead to another uncontrolled chain reaction. (<em>“Fukushima Daiichi Unit 3 is not going to explode,”</em> says Gunderson in a headline, but he can’t know that with certainty.)</p>
<p>For the near future, what all that means, in effect, is that the world has to accept chronic radiation releases from Fukushima as the price for avoiding another catastrophic release. And even then, it’s not a sure thing.</p>
<p>But there’s another aspect of Fukushima Unit #3 that’s even less reassuring. Unit #3 is the one Fukushima reactor that was running on Mixed oxide fuel, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOX_fuel" target="_blank">MOX fuel</a>, in its fuel rods.<a href="http://www.nrc.gov/materials/fuel-cycle-fac/mox/faq.html" target="_blank">MOX fuel</a> typically uses Plutonium mixed with one or more forms of Uranium. Using<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium" target="_blank">Plutonium</a> in fuel rods adds to their toxicity in the event of a meltdown. In part because Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 240,000 years and can be used to make nuclear weapons of “dirty bombs,” its use in commercial reactors remains both <a href="http://www.nirs.org/factsheets/basicmoxinfo.htm" target="_blank">limited</a> and <a href="http://www.nirs.org/factsheets/basicmoxinfo.htm" target="_blank">controversial</a>. Because it contains Plutonium, MOX fuel is <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/03/15/mox-the-toxic-fuel-inside-japans-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-plant.html" target="_blank">more toxic</a> than other nuclear fuel and will burn at lower temperatures. As <em>Natural Resources News</em> reported in 2011:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The mixed oxide fuel rods used in the compromised number three reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi complex contain enough plutonium to threaten public health with the possibility of inhalation of airborne plutonium particles…. Plutonium is at its most dangerous when it is inhaled and gets into the lungs. The effect on the human body is to vastly increase the chance of developing fatal cancers.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Reportedly, TEPCO plans don’t call for the removal of the MOX fuel in Unit #3 for another decade or more. <a href="http://nuclear-news.net/2013/06/29/lethal-mox-fuel-to-be-removed-from-fukushima-reactor-no-3-starting-in-2020/" target="_blank">Fuel removal</a> from Units #1, #2, and #3 is complicated by lethal radiation levels at all three reactors, as well as TEPCO’s <a href="http://enenews.com/experts-portion-of-fukushimas-molten-fuel-is-believed-to-have-moved-into-earth-groundwater-contacting-melted-cores-may-have-caused-recent-spike-in-radiation-levels" target="_blank">inability so far to locate</a> the three melted cores with any precision.</p>
<p>There is ample reason to hope that Fukushima, despite the complex of uncontrollable and deteriorating factors, will not get worse, because even the Japanese don’t want that. But there is little reason to expect anything but worsening conditions, slowly or suddenly, for years and years to come. And there is even less reason to expect anyone in authority anywhere to be more than minimally and belatedly truthful about an industry they continue to protect, no matter how many people it damages or kills.</p>
<p>The perfect paradigm of that ruthlessly cynical nuclear mentality is the current Japanese practice of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/30/us-fukushima-workers-idUSBRE9BT00520131230" target="_blank">recruiting homeless people</a> to work at Fukushima in high level radiation areas where someone with something to lose might not be willing to go for minimum wage.</p>

<p>     Shut down the military?  Save six trillion dollars in just a few years, balance the budget immediately, get weaponized tanks out of our cities and stop killing people abroad?  Absolutely.</p>
<p>      Shut down the nuclear killing fields?  No more deformed babies born in Kosovo and Iraq and Libya and Gaza and Afghanistan?  No more possible Chernobyls and Fukashimas here in America?  No more deadly stockpiles of nuclear waste being generated daily that will last long after the human race is toast?  I&#8217;m so there.</p>
<p>     Shut down the CIA?  We&#8217;d have world peace within the year!  No more rendition and torture camps, no more destabilization of countries with oil?  I want that.  Badly.</p>
<p>     Shut down the NSA?  No more spying on our phones and computers?  George Orwell would heave a sigh of relief from his grave &#8212; and I certainly would too.</p>
<p>     Shut down all those perqs to RepubliDem Congressmen?  Why not.  They have never earned their keep anyway.</p>
<p>     Shut down all those subsidies to agribusiness, Monsanto, the Koch brothers&#8217; lumber empire, etc.?  Bring back the small farmer and the Lorax?  Just imagine that.  Wonderful.</p>
<p>     Shut down the subsidies to Big Pharma?  So we could once again afford to buy our medicine without going to Canada?  I&#8217;m certainly willing to give that a try.</p>
<p>     Shut down Homeland Security?  Stop wasting money checking our junk and irradiating us at airports and making us paranoid and spending our money to run a police state?  Whoopie!</p>
<p>     Shut down the FBI and all those other agencies that didn&#8217;t protect JFK and aren&#8217;t protecting you and me but rather the corporate mega-state?  And spend all their time putting citizen-protestors in jail for years and pursuing whistle-blowers but let Wall Street mega-criminals go?  I have no problem with that.</p>
<p>     Shut down MediCare?  Just try it.  You&#8217;ll have an army of irate old folks in wheelchairs and walkers descending on Washington with canes in our hands and blood in our eye!</p>
<p>     Shut down Social Security?  That we earned over time with our bare hands?  Do you really want hundreds of thousands of truly-pissed-off senior citizens morphing into full-rebellion mode?  The Greatest Generation brought down the Third Reich.  And it can bring down the Fourth Reich too.  </p>
<p>     Just as soon as we find our false teeth.</p>

</div>
<p>You know, in spite of the visit from <i>The Bone Lady</i> when I was just three years old, and all the grim foreshadowing that she downloaded to me via direct intuition, I always held out hope that humanity could or would somehow turn things around on this planet, and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<p>As long as there is breath there is always hope, that was my thinking for a long time, but I am no longer so sanguine.</p>
<p>As one of my friends recently remarked to me, there is, indeed, real evil abroad in this world. I don’t know how else to explain the wickedness of what is happening at Fukushima, in Japan, where the situation with the exploded and/or melted down nuclear reactors just goes from frightfully dire to unimaginably worse.</p>
<p>I frequently check the developments there at <a href="http://www.enenews.com/" target="_blank"><em>www.enenews.com</em></a> and the latest news is very disturbing. I said from the outset, in the spring of 2011, that Tokyo would be evacuated. I still believe that to be inevitable. It is possible that much of Japan will be evacuated to elsewhere. The apocalyptic dimensions of the crisis are being covered up by TEPCO, the Japanese government, General Electric, and the USSA government. The reality is that there was at least one, and maybe more, really dirty nuclear blasts there in March of 2011, that wrecked the reactors and created a radioactive hell that no one knows how to remedy or bring under control. At the least we are probably looking at the failure and collapse of Japanese society with likely evacuation of tens of millions of people or more, and the fairly rapid death of vast portions of the Pacific Ocean, as deadly radioactive waste water continues to flow into the sea by the hundreds of tons, every day.</p>
<p>And when the cooling pool at reactor four collapses, the many tons of highly radioactive, spent, fuel rods that it contains will overheat and burn and or catastrophically fission, i.e., cause a runaway, nuclear reaction, or, in lay man’s terms, there will be another atomic explosion, along with a mushroom cloud, and tons of highly poisonous nuclear isotopes will be spread aloft into the atmosphere and/or will drain or be blown into the sea, to poison the Pacific Ocean even further.</p>
<p>This is worse than bad news. This is planetary chaos news. This is civilization ending news. This is species extinction level news, as in extinction of the human species on this planet. If you do not think so, all I can say is: wait. It won’t be long. Probably not ten years, not five, maybe even by Christmas this year, and you will begin to see what i mean, if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>And even if the cooling pool at reactor four doesn’t fail or collapse of its own accord in the near future, though that is very highly probable, TEPCO’s plan to manually remove the many tons of bent, mangled, fused, welded together, very highly radioactive fuel rods that remain in the pool, beginning in November of this year, is so fraught with peril that it is likely to spectacularly fail, with unimaginably negative consequences. Any slight mistake, miscue or dropped fuel rod could result in a fission criticality, a runaway nuclear chain reaction, to wit, an atomic explosion that will shower the northern hemisphere and the Pacific Basin with a fatal radioactive sleet that will persist for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>As I said, the situation is somewhere far south of dire, with a headlong, hellward trajectory.</p>
<h4>The Nuclear Chain Reaction</h4>
<p>Because what is inevitable, the longer the situation at Fukushima festers, is that the whole site will have to be abandoned. Due to the high radiation levels, no one will be able to work there without dying. So the workers will pull back, and the cooling pools and storage pools that contain thousands of tons of extremely radioactive, spent fuel rods will fail or collapse and there will be more explosions and radioactive fires. As the radioactively contaminated NO GO ZONE expands, as the population flees, the day will come when nuclear reactors at other, nearby power generating plants will also fail, melt down and/or explode, because the nuclear engineers and maintenance workers no longer come to work and operate them — BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD.</p>
<p>And then there will be three or four more, and the radioactive No Go Zone will expand, widen, grow. And other nuclear power plants will then fail, melt down and/or explode, because their operators are also DEAD, and so do not come to work, do not maintain them.</p>
<p>There are over 50 nuclear power reactors in Japan, and they all have their spent fuel rod cooling pools. It doesn’t matter if the reactors themselves are shut down, because there are thousands and thousands of tons of highly radioactive, spent, nuclear fuel rods stored in the cooling pools all over Japan. So, given time, the crisis will continue to fester and worsen, and then it will begin to cascade, like a row of toppling dominoes, only it will be a series of failing nuclear power reactors, one after the other, heralding the end of the nuclear age, and quite possible the end of humanity.</p>
<p>It’s just that serious.</p>
<p>All of that will send a killing wave of radioactivity across the Pacific to North America. So what happens when the population on the west coast of the USSA flees in panic from the approaching killer wave of radioactivity? Well, there will be no one left to operate the nuclear power reactors in California, for example. or at Palo Verde, the massive nuclear power plant just to the west of Phoenix. So when those nuclear reactors and their spent fuel cooling pools fail, melt down, and/or blow up, the civilization-ending, planet-killing, Fukushima Syndrome will come home to America with a wicked vengeance.</p>
<p>All courtesy of General Electric. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant">General Electric designed five out of the six reactors at Fukushima and built three of them</a>, so what we see here is genocidal, planet-killing failure of American (alleged) “high technology” on a spectacular scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Bring_Good_Things_to_Life">General Electric — busy exterminating a planet near you of its resident, biological life forms.</a></p>
<p>At the end of the day, all the differential calculus, the nuclear physics, the nuclear chemistry, the nuclear engineering, the corporate profits, the Madison Avenue advertising slogans, the multinational wheeling and dealing, all has conspired to assassinate the planet on which we, and they, all live. Make no mistake, the planet is now dying. The global poisoning process is so very far advanced that it probably cannot be stopped. Certainly, there is not now any serious, international effort to do so, not anything remotely commensurate with the level of danger that we are facing.</p>
<p>No doubt we are dealing with profound iniquity, a betrayal so complete of all that is human that no words exist to describe its foul dimension. The ones who have done this thing walk among us, though for how long? – understanding that they, too, will certainly drop dead along with countless millions of others, as a direct result of their abjectly arrogant ignorance.</p>
<h4>Arrogant Ignorance</h4>
<p>All of their super-computers, the advanced mathematics, their (so-called) “hi-tech” industrial base, all of their billions of dollars of (so-called) “high finance” — and they kill the planet? And themselves and their posterity in the process? That’s the best they can do? They get a PhD in nuclear chemistry and use their (so-called) “knowledge” and (so-called) technical “expertise” to kill the planet? <b>The planet that they also live on?<i></i></b></p>
<p>Geniuses. All of them.</p>
<h4>Central Banking Middle East Madness</h4>
<p>Then there is the very real prospect of a shooting, nuclear war, beginning in the Middle East. The USSA has a powerful fleet in the region. So do the Russians, as a counterpoint. Sadly for all humanity, the Washington, DC — City of London — Lower Manhattan — Tel Aviv — NATO cabal seems hell bent on war, and so we are on the slippery slope to war. Unfortunately, this psychopathic cabal is very heavily nuclear armed.</p>
<p>I saw all of this coming from waaaaaaay back, from way back in my infancy, since the age of three years, when <i>The Bone Lady</i> visited me and clued me in to realities that I still don’t want to think about, given their ghastly, hideous savagery. But I’ll tell you what, it’s enough to give a man insomnia, it’s enough to drive him out onto the nuclear missile silos, again and again, in a personal effort to inject a note of sanity and warning into a positively insane political and military climate, in an attempt to wake up anyone who may be susceptible to awakening.</p>
<p>ANYONE.</p>
<p>My latest sally was 15 April 2010 in North Dakota, USA. I went over the security fence onto the H-8 Minuteman III nuclear missile silo in the Minot Air Force Base nuclear missile field, near Parshall, North Dakota, at the intersection of 33rd Street and 76th Avenue. I conducted a nonviolent, peace demonstration on the silo and was arrested by the USSA military and imprisoned for 100 days, almost all of the time served in the Heart of America Correctional and Treatment Center in Rugby, North Dakota.</p>
<p><a href="http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html">My Minot Manifesto explains my motivations, reasons and spiritual and political philosophy.</a> It is one of the most important documents I have written in my entire life.</p>
<p><a href="http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/serious-message-from-heart-of-america.html">A Serious Message From The Heart of America was my personal statement that I mailed to the news media from jail in Rugby, North Dakota, on 14 July 2010,</a> prior to being criminally tried and convicted in USSA federal court in Minot, North Dakota.</p>
<p>I explain the symbolism in my dress and accoutrements in the photo below, in the text of my lengthy <a href="http://eventhorizonchronicle.blogspot.com/2010/10/minot-manifesto.html">Minot Manifesto</a>. It’s thirteen pages, but worth the time and effort to read. It is a major life statement on my part, that reflects literal decades of deep thought, a very large quantum of concentrated life energy and hours, weeks, months and years of preparation, a statement that distills an important fraction of my life essence into human language. I invite you to partake of my gift by taking the time to read and reflect on what I have written, and then to take meaningful, principled, creative, nonviolent action yourself.</p>
<p>I don’t quite know what more to say, what more to do. In fact, were I to do more than I already have, and I have been out on the nuclear missile silos three times (and been jailed for my trouble all three times, in Arkansas, Missouri and North Dakota), I would run the very real risk of infringing on <b>your</b> right and <b>your</b> very real, personal <b>RESPONSIBILITY</b> to also courageously act. So what are you waiting for? Why are you here on this planet, at this time, reading this blog post, and articles like it?</p>
<p>Because make no mistake about it, the time to act, if you are going to act, is here. The time has arrived. The planet is on the brink. We face the very real prospect of a shooting nuclear war. Additionally, the Fukushima crisis, and the threat from nuclear power plants in general, ALL OF THEM, could not be more serious.</p>
<p>In recent days, I find myself musing about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gb0mxcpPOU">the closing scene from “Dr. Stramgelove,” with the haunting song by Vera Lynn, “We’ll Meet Again, Don’t Know Where, Don’t Know When,” that was such a huge hit in World War II,</a> for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And it fills me with such melancholy and sorrow. Because if it starts, this ugly thing called nuclear war, and we are headed that way, can all unravel very rapidly. The machines will take over, and automated, pre-programmed orders of battle will be carried out, without human control, as machines battle machines with nuclear fire. Waves of missiles will come in, again and again, to batter the underground bases. I have read the declassified documents. Warhead after warhead will come in at 10 minute intervals. You cannot imagine the depths of the hell that is already programmed and waiting to be unleashed.</p>
<p>Back in the 1960s, the USSA military was counting on 140 million casualties in the mainland USSA alone. I know this because I have read the documents. I have done the research. The USSA population is much larger now, and much more urban, so the casualty rate would be even higher. Maybe 200 million? 250 million casualties in the USSA alone?</p>
<p>Do you think you will just watch that on CNN?</p>
<h4>Refuge in the Southern Hemisphere</h4>
<p>If you have read my previous writings you will know that I have said that <b>IF</b> humanity has a future, it is likely to be in the southern hemisphere, if only because the lion’s share of the nuclear weapons and nuclear power reactors are in the northern hemisphere. As the nuclear power plants fail, melt down, and/or explode most of them will be in the northern hemisphere. This is not an intellectual exercise — already we have had catastrophic failure of nuclear power plants at Chernobyl, Ukraine and Fukushima, Japan. They are just the first. There will be more.</p>
<p>Likewise, any shooting nuclear war is logically likely to be concentrated in the northern hemisphere, since all of the known, nuclear armed, military powers are in the northern hemisphere</p>
<p>But even then, there are enormous problems in the southern hemisphere. The vegetation in the Amazon region of South America produces something like 20 to 30% of the oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere. As the Amazon dies, and it is being destroyed right now, so too, is the Earth’s breathable oxygen supply being destroyed. I don’t know about you, but I breathe oxygen all day and all night, every day and every night of my life.</p>
<p>So even if we resolve the nuclear issue, and there is ZERO progress on that front right now, only to lose the Amazon, we all will still die, because none of us can survive with 20 to 30% less oxygen. Just cannot.</p>
<p>Right now, we, humanity, every last one of us, are in a life and death struggle for the life of our species, and the life of our planet.</p>
<p>If we win, we live. If we lose, we die. ALL OF US.</p>
<p>End of the story. End of our species’ genetic line. For ever and ever.</p>
<p>Done. Finished.</p>
<p>So maybe moving to Bolivia or Uruguay or Namibia or Madagascar or New Zealand will buy you a little time, a year or ten. However, if we fail to rein in and ABOLISH nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, if we fail to reforest the Earth and cleanse it of radioactive contamination, then we are through. It’s the end for us.</p>
<p>This is our group decision. Right now we are on a self-destructive path to global extinction.</p>
<h4>So Here Is My View</h4>
<p>If you will act decisively, now is the time. Pick your issue and your spot and act creatively, courageously and nonviolently.</p>
<p>It’s your world and your life. Act like they both count for something.</p>
<p>And here’s the other thing. If you cannot, or will not act, then how about supporting those of us who have acted, and who continue to act?</p>
<p>In my case, I have paid a very heavy price, in earnings forever foregone, by putting my life on the line, repeatedly, for you, whom I do not even know. But because you are my human kin, I went out on the missile silos, again and again, and I went to jail. I lost more than a year and a half of productive labor. I lost, as well, the opportunity to have a whole wide range of well paying jobs, due to my arrest and prison record, even though I have multiple advanced university degrees, up to the doctorate level.</p>
<p>Subsequent to my arrival in South America, I immersed myself in Amazonian shamanic culture, the better to understand the Amazonian region, the jungle itself, and the shamanic human ecology of the region that interfaces with the hyper-conscious plants in the jungle, only to be very gravely assaulted by one of the said Amazonian shamans and hospitalized for more than four months with massive trauma to both my body and emotions. I am now pursing a criminal case against the shaman and that also costs heavily, several thousands of dollars in attorneys’ fees, at the very time when so much of my time and energy is taken up with therapy and the sheer physical effort of getting around with impaired mobility. Nine months after the assault I still have physical nerve trauma in my lower extremities, a good deal of numbness and what is called drop foot. I walk with crutches. My electro-therapy also costs. At the moment I cannot go to electro-therapy, although I badly need it, because I only have $35 to my name.</p>
<p>I have run completely through my meager life savings and there is no more.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have this week begun the formal petition process to the government of Ecuador to request political asylum. My years-long record of anti-nuclear activism and repeated jailing by the USSA government is one factor in my decision, coupled with other factors such as recent revelations of universal NSA surveillance and espionage, the secret arrest and indefinite military detention provisions of the NDAA of 2012 and 2013, the recently revealed, previously secret 2011 FBI documents that blatantly discuss plans to murder Occupy Movement activists by sniper fire, including in San Antonio, Texas, where I lived and worked as a window washer from 2000 to 2009, and all of this in the context of an all encompassing pattern of unbridled lawlessness and pervasive lying with regard to EVERYTHING by the American government. All of this and more, has brought home to me the seriousness of this moment that we are living now.</p>
<p>I have the obligation to safeguard my own liberty and safety. It is clear to me that politically I am freer and safer in Ecuador than in the USSA. The American government has taken a hard, dictatorial turn towards neo-fascism. That is the plain truth. The harsh, repressive treatment of Edward Snowden and Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning makes that clear enough. We are in altogether different territory now. And so I have petitioned for political refuge in Ecuador.</p>
<p>This also entails paying an attorney, to assist me in my interactions with the administrative, legal and political system in Ecuador. It is my life on the line and I am proceeding very carefully, every step of the way.</p>
<p>But it is also your life on the line, in that my anti-nuclear activism, my immersion in the Amazonian culture, and my pursuit of political refuge in Ecuador all have profound implications far beyond just me. What happens to me also has broad implications for you. The consequences of nuclear war are too horrific to contemplate, and if it is to be avoided, it is because of actions such as mine. Similarly, we simply cannot afford to lose the Amazon, and yet we are losing it right now. If we are to save it, a big part of that will be due to the personal efforts of those who come to the region and get personally involved in the nitty-gritty, even life-threatening struggle for the soul of the Amazon, because more than anything, we are involved in a pitched battle for the very spirit and soul of the Amazon and of the rest of this planet.</p>
<p>Similarly, if I, with my history of activism, book writing, researching, blogging, public speaking, interviews, and repeated nonviolent civil disobedience and consequent jail record, cannot obtain political refuge abroad, then what hope do you have? You’re boxed in, that’s what. You’re in a cage with no exit.</p>
<p>And so, if you cannot or have not done the things that I and others like myself have done and are doing, then can you please, will you at least please support us?</p>
<p>I desperately need your support now. My legal fees run to thousands of dollars, and my therapy is ongoing. I appreciate and really need your generosity. Please communicate with me at: <b>dr.samizdat1618@gmail.com</b> or via Skype at <b>richard.sauder333</b> as to how to donate.</p>
<h4>Come Ye That Love The Lord</h4>
<p>I am a native Virginian, and have lived, worked, traveled, studied and gone to jail all over the American South, from the Virginias and Maryland, all the way across to South Texas, and numerous points in between. A very large block of my life has been spent down South. Although I am not now a church attending man, I have in the past been in all kinds of Christian churches, both Black and White, in big cities and small country towns.</p>
<p>Some of the most memorable sermons I have ever heard have been by Black pastors in rural areas of the deep South. One of the things I like about the traditional Black style of hymn singing down South is the way that the head deacon or pastor will frequently line out a hymn, especially the first line or two of a verse, and then the other deacons or members of the choir will join in, accompanied by riffs on the organ, if there is an organist, and there are some really gifted organists playing in southern Black churches.</p>
<p>I well remember a sermon that I once chanced to hear, decades ago, by a Black lay preacher, one sultry, Sunday night, in a tiny little town way down South, about as far south as you can go, and still be in the South and not somewhere else. The ceiling fans lazily stirred the muggy summer air, as the moths flitted vainly around the naked incandescent light bulbs hanging from the ceiling overhead. The windows were flung wide open and the pale light from the sanctuary washed feebly out through the rusted screens and flooded onto the close cropped lawn that surrounded the church. It was one of the most extraordinary public speaking performances I ever witnessed. The preacher used as his text Ezekiel 37, the theme being dry bones and systematically connecting them one to the other, the purpose being to reassemble and restore “them dry bones” to life. As he spoke, I saw that he fell into a trance, that he entered another state of consciousness, that he was self-hypnotized and that the sermon itself had a sort of existence independent of him, that the message took on a life of its own and was using his mind, his mouth, his body, to project itself into the ears, hearts and minds of the sparse assemblage present that evening. As he finished, he collapsed exhausted backwards into his armchair and lined out the first words of the hymn that he wanted the choir to sing. I don’t anymore remember exactly what song he called for, but it could well have been this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxHmgHYG50o"><em>Come Ye That Love The Lord</em></a></p>
<p>If there is to truly be a new world order, as distinct from the obscene power that currently holds sway on this planet today, then we will need to see a completely new order of human being on this world, a species of human being motivated by love for the Creator and by devotion to inward and outward service to the sacred life impulse. We don’t see that now, and the human species may go extinct on this planet for its want.</p>
<p>I do believe in God and have been profoundly privileged to see some of His servants face to face. I find their company congenial.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Come, ye that love the Lord,<br />
And let your joys be known;<br />
Join in a song with sweet accord,<br />
And thus surround the throne.</i></p>
<p>Let those refuse to sing<br />
That never knew our God,<br />
But children of the heavenly King<br />
May speak their joys abroad.</p>
<p>The God of heaven is ours,<br />
Our Father and our love ;<br />
His care shall guard life’s fleeting hours,<br />
Then waft our souls above.</p>
<p>There shall we see his face,<br />
And never, never sin;<br />
There, from the rivers of his grace,<br />
Drink endless pleasures in.</p>
<p>Yes, and before we rise<br />
To that immortal state.<br />
The thoughts of such amazing bliss<br />
Should constant joys create.</p>
<p>Children of grace have found<br />
Glory begun below:<br />
Celestial fruits on earthly ground,<br />
From faith and hope may grow.</p>
<p>The hill of Sion yields<br />
A thousand sacred sweets,<br />
Before we reach the heavenly fields,<br />
Or walk the golden streets.</p>
<p><i>Then let our songs abound,<br />
And ev’ry tear be dry;<br />
We’re trav’lling through Immanuel’s ground,<br />
To fairer worlds on high.</i></p>
<p>(John Wesley, ca. 1703- 1791)</p></blockquote>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/radioactivefish3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/radioactivefish2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Japan&#8217;s apocalypse continues. Emergency conditions persist. No end in sight looms. Fukushima&#8217;s radioactive discharges can&#8217;t be stopped. They continue. They&#8217;re uncontainable.</p>
<p>At issue is by far the worst environmental disaster in history. It&#8217;s multiples worse than Chernobyl. It&#8217;s an unprecedented catastrophe. It&#8217;s reason enough to abolish nuclear power.</p>
<p>According to Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, about 300 tons of radioactive groundwater flow into the Pacific daily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s done so since Japan&#8217;s March earthquake and tsunami triggered Fukushima&#8217;s meltdown.</p>
<p>Tokyo Electric (TEPCO) says water&#8217;s getting over and around &#8220;chemical walls.&#8221; It can&#8217;t be stopped. Three Fukushima reactors suffered meltdowns. A fourth was badly damaged.</p>
<p>The worst fear remains. Unit Four&#8217;s structural integrity was seriously undermined. It contains hundreds of tons of highly radioactive water.</p>
<p>If an earthquake or other natural disaster occurs, its fuel rods almost certainly will catch fire. Radioactive emissions will follow. They&#8217;ll compound what&#8217;s already disastrous.</p>
<p>Emissions will continue longterm. They&#8217;ll circle the planet. They cause catastrophic harm.</p>
<p>Since March 2011, Tepco estimates around 20 to 40 trillion radioactive tritium becquerels leaked into the Pacific. So have large cesium and strontium discharges. They continue. They&#8217;re much more dangerous.</p>
<p>According to nuclear expert <a href="http://fairewinds.org/media/in-the-news/there-is-no-way-to-stop-fukushima-radioactive-water-leaking-into-the-pacific" target="_blank">Arnie Gunderson</a>, &#8220;(t)he horse is already out of the barn.&#8221; Leakage continues since earthquake and tsunami struck.</p>
<p>Radioactive water contaminates the Pacific. Gunderson&#8217;s &#8220;experience with underground water is that &#8211; if it is serious at the ocean, it is more serious&#8221; on land.</p>
<p>Japanese officials proposed erecting a barrier. At issue is preventing water from reaching the Pacific. Whatever&#8217;s done &#8220;is two years too late and will be too late by the time&#8221; construction&#8217;s finished, said Gunderson.</p>
<p>A barrier&#8217;s not the solution. It causes another problem. &#8220;If the water can&#8217;t go anywhere into the Pacific Ocean, it is going to build up onsite, which means that the nuclear reactors themselves will become unstable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The water can pull underneath the nuclear buildings and if there is an earthquake, in fact the nuclear buildings could topple. So, by solving one problem, they are creating another problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gunderson believes contaminated water will keep discharging for at least 20 to 30 years. It&#8217;s the most radioactive water he ever experienced.</p>
<p>Cost is another issue. Cleanup involves around half a trillion dollars, says Gunderson. Most important is human health.</p>
<p>Epidemic cancer levels are certain. And not just in Japan. In early July, Fukushima&#8217;s former chief operator, Masao Yoshida, died of esophogeal cancer.</p>
<p>He was 58. Tepco lied saying his death was unrelated to radiation exposure. Japanese children are experiencing a shocking 40% rise in thyroid irregularities.</p>
<p>Experts expect much higher numbers ahead. Fukushima&#8217;s an ongoing disaster. It persists. It&#8217;s not ending. It&#8217;ll continue for decades.</p>
<p>According to Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IEER) president <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/08/10-0" target="_blank">Arjun Makhijani</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fukushima continues to be an emergency without end &#8211; vast amounts of radioactivity, including strontium-90 in the groundwater, evidence of leaks into the sea, the prospect of contaminated seafood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strontium-90, being a calcium analog, bioaccumulates in the food chain. It is likely to be a seaside nightmare for decades.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much more dangerous than cesium 137 and 134. It&#8217;s at levels 30 times higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;So to give you an idea of the level of contamination, if somebody drank that water for a year, they would almost certainly get cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s one problem. The other is the defenses to hold back this water from the sea seem to be overcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So now the contaminated waters, 70,000, 80,000 gallons, are flowing into the sea every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(S)ome of it will disperse and dilute. Some of it goes into the sediment, and some of it is taken up by the life in the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the unfortunate thing about strontium especially is that it bioaccumulates in algae. It bioaccumulates in fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It targets the bone, because it&#8217;s like calcium. And so this is a problem. We don&#8217;t have measurements far out to sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Woods Hole Institute has done some surveys. And they were surprised by how much continuing radioactivity they found, but no clear explanation yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The effect on human health&#8217;s expected to be devastating. It&#8217;s already bad. It&#8217;s getting progressively worse. The genie&#8217;s out of the bottle. No end in sight looms.</p>
<p>Strontium-90 and cesium are both perilous. &#8220;(S)ince strontium-90 is more mobile and also more dangerous biologically, (it) behaves like calcium, so it goes to the bone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It also bioaccumulates in the base of the food chain and algae. Ultimately because it does bioaccumulate and there is quite a lot of strontium, you could have a large part of the food chain near Fukushima being contaminated.&#8221;</p>
<p>If pregnant women ingest contaminated water, fish or other food, &#8220;the outcomes could be worse than cancer because then you’re talking about a much more compromised child in the sense of having a compromised immune system &#8211; it makes you more vulnerable to all kinds of diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Makhijani doesn&#8217;t know how Tepco can handle the problem. It&#8217;s uncontrollable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very, very unclear to me how they are going to be able to get at this molten fuel, extract it from the bottoms of these highly damaged buildings and package it for safer or less dangerous storage or disposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an accident that&#8217;s shockingly not stopping.&#8221; It&#8217;s certain to worsen. It&#8217;s unchartered territory.</p>
<p>It affects the region. It&#8217;s humanity&#8217;s worst environmental nightmare. Nuclear rain affects North America and Europe. Obama&#8217;s an unabashed nuclear power promoter.</p>
<p>He wants more reactors built. He wants licenses for aging poorly maintained plants with poor safety records extended. He wants them operating unregulated.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s recklessly endangering Americans. He talks clean energy alternatives. Policy measures spurn them. He fronts for corporate favorites.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s captive to a destructive industry. He risks a Fukushima-type disaster on US soil. He risks millions of American lives. He&#8217;s mindless of potential dangers.</p>
<p>Nuclear power&#8217;s inherently unsafe. Einstein called it a hellova way to boil water. It does so through massive heat. It turns it into steam. It powers an electricity generating turbine.</p>
<p>According to anti-nuclear activist Karl Grossman:</p>
<p>Avoiding potentially catastrophic accidents &#8220;requires perfection and no acts of God.&#8221; Humans and technology aren&#8217;t perfect. Natural and other disasters happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t eliminate them. But we can &#8211; and must &#8211; eliminate atomic energy.&#8221; Otherwise it&#8217;ll eliminate us.</p>
<p>Nuclear expert Helen Caldicott&#8217;s clear and unequivocal, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a physician, I contend that nuclear technology threatens life on our planet with extinction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If present trends continue, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink will soon be contaminated with enough radioactive pollutants to pose a potential health hazard far greater than any plague humanity has ever experienced.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t get any clearer than that.</p>
<p>A Final Comment</p>
<p>Coverup and denial followed Chernobyl&#8217;s disaster. Helen Caldicott called doing so &#8220;the most monstrous coverup in the history of medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The death toll was many multiples greater than reported. Estimates range up to a million or more.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.nyas.org/publications/annals/Detail.aspx?cid=f3f3bd16-51ba-4d7b-a086-753f44b3bfc1" target="_blank"> New York Academy of Sciences</a> (NYAS) translated thousands of Russian articles and papers. It added &#8220;revised and updated contributions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Written by leading authorities from Eastern Europe, the volume outlines the history of the health and environmental consequences of the Chernobyl disaster,&#8221; NYAS said.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the authors, official discussions from the (IAEA) and associated (UN) agencies (e.g. the Chernobyl reports) have largely downplayed or ignored many of the findings reported in the Eastern European scientific literature and consequently have erred by not including these assessments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fukushima far exceeds Chernobyl. Millions of lives are threatened. Perhaps future independent studies will explain. They&#8217;ll be too little to late to help victims.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/healthpress-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/healthpress-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Oh crap.  I seem to be doomed to become an expert on almost every new major epidemic in America &#8212; and to do it the hard way.  First I had friends die of HIV-related causes back in the 1980s.  Then more of my friends became parents of children with autism back in the 1990s.  And now I have lots of friends with kids that suffer from asthma.  What&#8217;s with that?</p>
<p>    America is spozed to be the healthiest country in the world.  So why aren&#8217;t we?  Why are Americans by the millions now falling victim to these new plagues?  And, further, might these three currently-upsurging epidemics have anything in common that could possibly give us a clue?  Yeah.  The people who get them mostly seem to have weakened immune systems &#8212; even before they actually start presenting symptoms.  </p>
<p>     But then, heck, lots of other modern upsurging diseases such as cancer, diabetes, the flu and even the lowly common cold appear to affect people with weakened immune systems the most.  </p>
<p>     According to <a href="http://www.cancerfightingstrategies.com">www.cancerfightingstrategies.com</a>, &#8220;For most of your life, your immune system successfully fought cancerous cells, killing them as they developed.  That&#8217;s its job.  In fact, the only job Natural Killer cells have is to kill cancer cells and viruses.  For cancer to develop, your immune system must either be worn out, ineffective, unable to kill cancer cells as fast as they normally develop, or you must be exposed to a mass of cancer causing toxins, radiation or some such thing, that increase the rate of development of cancer cells to an abnormally high level that your immune system can&#8217;t handle.&#8221;   I rest my case.</p>
<p>     But this association with modern diseases and immune system vulnerability should (but rarely does) bring up the next really important question:  How come American immune systems are now suddenly starting to suck eggs?  </p>
<p>     You and I now live in one of the most richest, most well-off countries in the world.  We&#8217;ve got clean houses, air-conditioning, abundant food, luxury cars, malls, all kinds of wonderful things.  But our immune systems are now clearly sagging.  Why is that?</p>
<p>     Even Ann Romney has multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease &#8212; and she&#8217;s freaking rich beyond belief.  </p>
<p>     And even I have immune-system issues &#8212; despite the fact that I mostly eat organic stuff and lead a boringly-clean life (except of course for the occasional slice of chocolate cream pie from <a href="http://www.sweetadelinebakeshop.com/">Sweet Adeline Bakeshop</a>  or cupcakes from <a href="http://www.loveatfirstbitebakery.com/">Love at First Bite</a> ).</p>
<p>     According to Donna Jackson Nakazawa, &#8220;Autoimmune diseases are the eighth leading cause of death among women, shortening the average patient&#8217;s lifespan by fifteen years.  Not surprisingly, the economic burden is staggering: autoimmune diseases represent a yearly health-care burden of more than $120 billion, compared to the yearly health-care burden of $70 billion for direct medical costs for cancer.&#8221;  And that&#8217;s not even counting asthma, HIV or autism &#8212; which are not <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/80129/the_autoimmune_epidemic%3A_bodies_gone_haywire_in_a_world_out_of_balance">autoimmune diseases</a> per se but are also related to having a weakened immune system.  </p>
<p>     So even though we&#8217;ve got more money here than we know what do do with, America&#8217;s health is getting worse instead of better.  Plus all of these chronic diseases and infirmities are now costing us barrels &#8212; to say nothing of funeral expenses.  </p>
<p>     So what&#8217;s my point &#8212; that it&#8217;s not safe to live in America any more?  That living on American soil is a death sentence?  That I should win the lottery and move to some isolated south-sea island?  Or just simply &#8220;shelter in place&#8221;.  </p>
<p>     Perhaps there is no clear answer to this conundrum &#8212; but I would really like to know why no one seems to be asking this quintessential question:  &#8220;Why are so many of my friends and their children suffering from asthma, autism, multiple sclerosis and, to quote Nakazawa again, &#8216;type 1 diabetes, Graves&#8217; disease, vasculitis, myasthenia gravis, connective tissue diseases, autoimmune Addison&#8217;s disease, vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, hemolytic anemia, celiac disease, and scleroderma&#8217;?&#8221;  </p>
<p>     Why here?  Why now?</p>
<p>     Perhaps the answer to these questions might be found in the concept of &#8220;body burden&#8221; &#8212; that it&#8217;s not just one thing or another that is weakening our immune systems.  Rather, it is all the small things in our lives that are being added together.  You add up a little bit of pesticide exposure and combine it with a small bit of air pollution, a few dozen vaccines, a whole bunch of food additives and trans-fats, some radiation left over from Chernobyl, Fukushima, San Onofre and depleted uranium, drinking from plastic bottles, black mold, allergies, pharmaceutical overload, constant cell phone and computer usage, lipstick, fluoride, hairspray, antibiotics in beef, diet colas&#8230;.  The list goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>     So what can we do to stabilize or even reduce our own individual &#8220;body burden&#8221;?  And why isn&#8217;t your doctor and Big Pharma working on this instead of just pushing more pills at us &#8212; pills that may or may not reduce the symptoms but not the cause.  Pills that add to our body burden instead of reducing it?  Pills that do NOT strengthen our immune systems.</p>
<p>  Since there are over 60 vaccines being given to children right now, a wise parent might consider using a little common sense when jabbing the tots.  If it&#8217;s a vaccine for a life-threatening disease such as polio or if the kid is living in an environment where diphtheria or something is an immediate threat, then by all means go for it.  Otherwise?  Not.</p>
<p>     Also, it&#8217;s a good idea to only give our children one shot at a time.  Giving five different vaccines in one day &#8212; and many doctors do this &#8212; is a hecka &#8220;body burden&#8221; for little kids to absorb all at once, especially babies and toddlers.  Ouch!</p>
<p>  My theory about the main reason why people get sick involves the fact that, in the long run, our bodies are always stronger than our minds.  You think that your mind is the boss of your body?  Think again!</p>
<p>      &#8220;But Jane,&#8221; you might say, &#8220;everyone knows that illness is caused by germs!&#8221;  Not really.  There are always germs all around us.  Germs are always with us.  But we generally only become susceptible to all but the most evil of these little critters only when our bodies become run down and our immune system weakens &#8212; or our &#8220;body burden&#8221; hits a red zone on the charts.</p>
<p>     &#8220;But how exactly do our bodies actually overpower our minds?&#8221; you might ask.  &#8220;That sounds really weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>     Here&#8217;s how it happens:  In today&#8217;s modern life, our minds are always trying to get us into stressful situations or do just one more thing before bedtime or live in the fast lane of our choice or dine only on junk food.  But our bodies are actually the ones who are really running the show &#8212; and when they need a rest, no matter what our brains are thinking, our bodies just open their doors and invite in the germs.  And we get sick.  And our bodies get their well-needed rest.  End of discussion.</p>
<p>     &#8220;What?&#8221; screams our bodies, &#8220;You want to stay up all night and party and then live on Twinkies and then work day and night for three days straight?  Forget that!  I&#8217;m going on strike!&#8221;  And they do.</p>
<p>     And what our bodies say goes.</p>
<p>     And this is why no one will ever get rid of the common cold.</p>
<p>     And, also, when our &#8220;body burden&#8221; gets too heavy &#8212; from all the junk food that we eat and/or the chemicals, pesticides and radioactivity we are exposed to &#8212; then our bodies also falter, no matter what our brains tell us, and then we also get sick.</p>
<p>      But do you really wanna know exactly what our brains are thinking about all this time, way back in our subconscious mind, back in our &#8220;reptile&#8221; brains, back beyond our control?  That&#8217;s easy.  &#8220;Junk food!  Sugar!  Hot caramel sundaes!&#8221;  (Not to mention happy thoughts of starting &#8220;preemptive&#8221; wars, robbing the national treasury in order to hoard billions or cheating on your wife.)  And there&#8217;s no mention at all back there of stuff like wheat-grass juice or carrot sticks &#8212; let alone Christ-like behavior or world peace.  Sigh.</p>
<p>     Sometimes our brains need to be put on a short leash &#8212; and sometimes only our bodies are up to that task. </p>

			<p><img src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Why-Are-So-Many-Bad-Things-Happening-To-America-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" />Have you ever wondered why things have been going so badly for the United States in recent years?  Our economy is falling apart, we have been plagued with heat, drought and endless natural disasters, our cities are absolutely crumbling, we just keep getting involved in even more wars and Americans are more anxious and more overweight than ever before.  So why are so many bad things happening to America?  Why do we lead the world in so many bad categories?  Why does nothing seem to be going right?  Are we under some kind of a curse?  It is almost as if we have entered a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; that just keeps getting worse.  In the old days it would seem like something bad would happen to the United States every once in a while, but now massive problems seem to be hitting us in rapid fire fashion.  At this point, many Americans have &#8220;crisis fatigue&#8221; because our problems never seem to end.  Each new crisis just seems to overlap with all of the other problems that are still going on.  So why is this happening, and what is our country going to look like if our problems continue to multiply at this rate?</p>
<p>The following are some of the bad things that are happening to America right now&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Heat And Drought</strong></p>
<p>This summer, thousands of new high temperature records have been set all over the country, and weather conditions are much drier than normal in most of the nation.</p>
<p>In fact, the drought that we are experiencing right now is being called the worst drought <a title="in more than 50 years" href="http://business.financialpost.com/2012/07/17/americas-worst-drought-since-56-threatens-world-food-supply/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+FP_TopStories+%28Financial+Post+-+Top+Stories%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">in more than 50 years</a>.  More than 1,000 counties in the United States have already been declared to be official disaster areas, and there is no end to the drought in sight.</p>
<p>All over America this drought is <a title="killing the corn" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/the-corn-is-dying-all-over-america" target="_blank">killing the corn</a> and this is causing the price of corn to soar.  The following is from a recent<a title="Financial Post article" href="http://business.financialpost.com/2012/07/17/americas-worst-drought-since-56-threatens-world-food-supply/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+FP_TopStories+%28Financial+Post+-+Top+Stories%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">Financial Post article</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Chicago Board of Trade corn for December delivery has soared 54% since mid-June, reaching a contract high of US$7.78 on Monday and approaching its record price near US$8.</em></p>
<p><em>Soybeans for November delivery soared to a new contract high of US$15.97 before slipping back a few cents.</em></p>
<p><em>Crop watchers were alarmed that corn rated poor-to-very poor jumped to 38%, versus 30% last week and 11% a year ago.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The record high for the price of corn is just $7.99 a bushel.  Many believe that the price of corn will soon blow well past that price and could eventually reach $10 a bushel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not much hope on the horizon.  It is being projected that these very hot and very dry conditions will persist <a title="well into August" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-largest-natural-disaster-in-u-s-history-the-endless-drought-of-2012-will-bake-america-well-into-august">well into August</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wildfires</strong></p>
<p>The extreme heat has also been responsible for an <a title="unusual number of wildfires" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/america-on-fire-why-is-the-number-of-wildfires-in-the-united-states-increasing" target="_blank">unusual number of wildfires</a> in the western United States this year.  The recent horrific wildfires in Colorado made headlines all over the nation.</p>
<p>Sadly, these wildfires are part of a rising trend.  The truth is that the <a title="6 worst years" href="http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/wildfires_getting_worse_around_the_world/" target="_blank">6 worst years</a> for wildfires in the United States ever recorded have all happened since the year 2000.</p>
<p>So what is causing this to happen?</p>
<p>What is causing so much of the country to go up in flames?</p>
<p><strong>Tornadoes</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, many areas of the heartland of America were absolutely ripped to shreds <a title="by very powerful tornadoes" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/why-is-the-heartland-of-america-being-ripped-to-shreds-by-gigantic-tornadoes-that-are-becoming-more-frequent-and-more-powerful" target="_blank">by very powerful tornadoes</a>.</p>
<p>More tornadoes happen in the United States than anywhere else in the world, and unfortunately we have seen a tremendous amount of tornado activity in this country in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2009, there were <a title="1146 tornadoes" href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/newm.html" target="_blank">1146 tornadoes</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>In 2010, there were <a title="1282 tornadoes" href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/newm.html" target="_blank">1282 tornadoes</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>In 2011, there were <a title="1691 tornadoes" href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/newm.html" target="_blank">1691 tornadoes</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>Overall, 2011 was the worst year for natural disasters <a title="in U.S. history" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/do-you-now-understand-why-you-need-to-prepare-for-emergencies-this-has-been-the-worst-year-for-natural-disasters-in-u-s-history" target="_blank">in U.S. history</a>.</p>
<p>So where will 2012 rank when everything is all said and done?</p>
<p><strong>Fukushima</strong></p>
<p>Radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster will be affecting Americans for many years to come.</p>
<p>Most Americans do not think much about Fukushima anymore, but the truth is that Fukushima is still putting out a tremendous amount of radiation, and that radiation travels eastward towards us.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, one reporter discovered that radiation levels in rain falling on Los Angeles were <a title="five times above normal" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LZRQrAtsT0&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">five times above normal</a>.</p>
<p>But we don&#8217;t hear about this in the mainstream media, do we?</p>
<p>One recent study concluded that the highest concentration of Fukushima radiation in the Pacific Ocean will eventually <a title="be just off the west coast of the United States" href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/3/034004/article" target="_blank">be just off the west coast of the United States</a>.</p>
<p>But our &#8220;authorities&#8221; tell us that there is no reason to be concerned, so most Americans will continue to ignore the incredible tragedy that continues to unfold at Fukushima.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what to think about what is going on at Fukushima, perhaps the following statistic will get your attention&#8230;.</p>
<p>Recent tests have shown that <a title="36 percent" href="http://www.pref.fukushima.jp/imu/kenkoukanri/240426shiryou.pdf" target="_blank">36 percent</a> of all children living in the Fukushima Prefecture in Japan have abnormal growths on their thyroid glands.  After the Chernobyl disaster, less than 2 percent of all children living in the area surrounding Chernobyl were found to have abnormal growths on their thyroid glands.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Collapse</strong></p>
<p>The last recession was the worst economic crisis that America has faced since the Great Depression, and our economy has never even come close to recovering from it.</p>
<p>Now we are on the verge of another <a title="global financial meltdown" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/19-warnings-about-a-coming-global-financial-catastrophe">global financial meltdown</a> that appears likely to be even worse than the last one.</p>
<p>Peter Schiff, the president of Euro Pacific Capital, says that the U.S. economy is headed for a crisis that will make the recession of 2008 and 2009 <a title="look like a walk in the park" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/breakout/bernanke-must-fess-level-american-public-schiff-120411403.html" target="_blank">look like a walk in the park</a>.</p>
<p>So what is going to happen if the economy goes into the toilet and unemployment skyrockets much higher <a title="than it is now" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/there-will-never-be-enough-jobs-in-america-again" target="_blank">than it is now</a>?</p>
<p>That is frightening to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Poverty Explosion</strong></p>
<p>Even during this &#8220;economic recovery&#8221;, poverty in America continues to soar.</p>
<p>For example, since Barack Obama has been president the number of Americans on food stamps has risen from 32 million to <a title="46 million" href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/34snapmonthly.htm" target="_blank">46 million</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, <a title="49 percent" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-28/americans-hooked-on-government-as-record-number-get-benefits.html" target="_blank">49 percent</a> of all Americans live in a home where at least one person receives benefits from the federal government according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  That is an all-time record high.</p>
<p><strong>The Death Of American Cities</strong></p>
<p>The United States once had dozens of great manufacturing cities that were the envy of the entire globe.</p>
<p>Today, many of those cities have degenerated into crime-ridden, drug infested <a title="hellholes" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/these-12-hellholes-are-examples-of-what-the-rest-of-america-will-look-like-soon" target="_blank">hellholes</a>.</p>
<p>Things have gotten so bad in Detroit that thousands of homes <a title="are literally being torn down" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/48214569" target="_blank">are literally being torn down</a> in an effort to &#8220;make the city safer&#8221;&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As the next step in an April deal between financially strapped Detroit and the state of Michigan, Governor Rick Snyder is finalizing a plan to tear down thousands of abandoned houses in a bid to make the city safer.</em></p>
<p><em>Detroit has been hard-hit over the past four decades by a steep drop in population, a steadily eroding tax base and crippling budget deficits, resulting in countless barren streets punctuated by vacant lots and burned-out buildings.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Increase In Crime</strong></p>
<p>Have you noticed that crime is on the rise in many of our communities?</p>
<p>The murder rate in Chicago is up <a title="38 percent" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9400468/Terrorised-Chicago-residents-plead-for-police-crackdown-as-gang-war-murders-soar.html" target="_blank">38 percent</a> so far this year, and justifiable homicide rose by <a title="79 percent" href="http://www.thedaily.com/page/2012/02/05/020512-news-detroit-vigilantes-1-5/" target="_blank">79 percent</a> in Detroit during 2011.</p>
<p>Criminals are getting bolder and are doing things that we have not seen before.</p>
<p>For example, on Saturday night a mob of 300 teens <a title="invaded a Wal-Mart in Jacksonville, Florida" href="http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2012-07-17/story/saturday-night-flash-mob-takes-over-jacksonville-wal-mart" target="_blank">invaded a Wal-Mart in Jacksonville, Florida</a> and went absolutely wild.  They started stealing stuff, breaking stuff and throwing food at each other without any concern for what the security guards would do.</p>
<p>When have we ever seen stuff like this happen in America before?</p>
<p>America already has <a title="the highest incarceration rate" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_pri_per_cap-crime-prisoners-per-capita" target="_blank">the highest incarceration rate</a> in the world and the largest <a title="total prison population" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html?_r=1" target="_blank">total prison population</a> on the entire planet by a very wide margin.</p>
<p>How many more people do we plan to lock up?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even many Americans that are not considered to be &#8220;criminals&#8221; are becoming very cold-hearted.  Just check out what happened in Arlington, Virginia recently.  A <a title="video surveillance camera captured footag" href="http://www.arlnow.com/2012/07/16/video-bystanders-walk-past-accident-victim-while-getting-on-the-bus/" target="_blank">video surveillance camera captured footag</a>e of numerous people walking right past a man that had just been hit by a car and was dying on the sidewalk.  He was lying face down and bleeding and nobody even went up to him to see if he was okay.</p>
<p>If you were in a similar situation, would you stop to help that man?</p>
<p><strong>Gang Violence</strong></p>
<p>All over America gangs are taking over local communities.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, there are now a total of <a title="1.4 million" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/1-4-million-gang-members-and-more-pour-into-the-united-states-every-single-day" target="_blank">1.4 million</a> gang members living in America.  Just since 2009, that number has risen by 40 percent.</p>
<p>To get an idea of how deeply Mexican drug cartels have infiltrated our cities, just check out the maps <a title="on this article" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/this-graphic-shows-what-mexican-cartels-and-drugs-come-to-your-town-2012-7" target="_blank">on this article</a>.</p>
<p>As I wrote about <a title="the other day" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/12-factors-that-are-turning-the-streets-of-america-into-a-living-hell">the other day</a>, there are only 200 police officers in Chicago&#8217;s Gang Enforcement Unit to go up against an estimated <a title="100,000 gang members" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57470618/chicago-police-sergeant-tribal-warfare-on-the-streets" target="_blank">100,000 gang members</a> living in the city of Chicago right now.</p>
<p>With numbers such as those, it is easy to see how violence in many of our cities could spiral out of control very, very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>War</strong></p>
<p>The United States continues to get pulled into more wars, and the conflicts that we are already involved in never seem to end.</p>
<p>Just today, <a title="22 NATO supply trucks" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57474737/22-nato-supply-trucks-destroyed-in-afghanistan/" target="_blank">22 NATO supply trucks</a> were destroyed in Afghanistan.  The war in Afghanistan has already lasted much longer than World War II did, and there is no end in sight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Barack Obama has gotten the U.S. military involved in conflicts in Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan and a whole bunch of other places.  The following is from a recent <a title="Wired article" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/obama-yemen/" target="_blank">Wired article</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The center of the <a title="US drone war has shifted to Yemen" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/yemen-war/" target="_blank">US drone war has shifted to Yemen</a>, where 23 American strikes have killed an estimated 155 people so far this year. But you wouldn’t know about it — or about the cruise missile attacks, or about the US commando teams in Yemen — by reading the report the White House sent to Congress about US military activities around the globe. Instead, there’s only the blandest acknowledgement of “direct action” in Yemen, “against a limited number of [al-Qaida] operatives and senior leaders.”</em></p>
<p><em>The <a title="report" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/presidential-letter-2012-war-powers-resolution-6-month-report" target="_blank">report</a>, issued late Friday, is the <a title="first time" href="http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2012/06/18/targeted-killings-and-congressional-oversight/" target="_blank">first time</a> the United States has publicly, officially acknowledged the operations in Yemen and in nearby Somalia that anyone with internet access could’ve told you about years ago. But the report doesn’t just fail to admit the extent of the shadow war that America is waging in the region. It’s borderline legal — at best. The <a title="War Powers Resolution of 1973" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution" target="_blank">War Powers Resolution of 1973</a> requires the president to inform Congress about any armed conflicts America is engaged in. Friday’s report isn’t just uninformative about Yemen. It doesn’t even mention the US campaign in Pakistan, even though the Defense Secretary says America is “<a title="at war" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/drone-war-admission/" target="_blank">at war</a>” there.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So what is next?</p>
<p>Well, there are endless headlines warning that war with Syria is coming.</p>
<p>Other headlines warn that war with Iran is coming.</p>
<p>Where will this all end?</p>
<p><strong>Anxiety Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>Americans today are more unhappy and more anxious than ever before.</p>
<p>The following is from a recent <a title="Business Insider article" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/an-anxiety-epidemic-has-swept-across-america-and-our-broken-meritocracy-is-to-blame-2012-7" target="_blank">Business Insider article</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>According to a recent World Health Organization study, 31 percent of Americans are likely to suffer from an anxiety problem at some point during their lifetimes &#8212; compared to 25.3 percent of those in Colombia, and 24.6 percent in New Zealand, the countries that rank second and third. You&#8217;d think people in developing or unstable states &#8212; those preoccupied with concerns farther down on the Maslow Scale &#8212; would be more anxious than we are. Not so. &#8220;According to the 2002 World Mental Health Survey, people in developing-world countries such as Nigeria are up to five times less likely to show clinically significant anxiety levels than Americans, despite having more basic life-necessities to worry about,&#8221; <a title="writes" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/01/its_not_the_job_market.html" target="_blank">writes</a> Taylor Clark, author of Nerve: Poise Under Pressure, Serenity Under Stress, and the Brave New Science of Fear and Cool. &#8220;What&#8217;s more, when these less-anxious developing-world citizens emigrate to the United States, they tend to get just as anxious as Americans.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The United States has transformed into the planet&#8217;s undisputed worry champion,&#8221; Clark adds.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Obesity Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>Of all the major industrialized nations, the United States is <a title="the most obese" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_obe-health-obesity" target="_blank">the most obese</a>, and a recent <a title="Gallup survey" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/155762/Americans-Concerns-Obesity-Soar-Surpass-Smoking.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines" target="_blank">Gallup survey</a> found that Americans are more concerned about our obesity epidemic than ever before.</p>
<p>And nobody can deny that we are getting fatter.</p>
<p>Back in 1962, <a title="only 13 percent" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-05-07/obesity-projections-adults/54791430/1" target="_blank">only 13 percent</a> of all Americans were obese.</p>
<p>Today, approximately <a title="36 percent" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/story/2012-05-07/obesity-projections-adults/54791430/1" target="_blank">36 percent</a> of all Americans are obese.</p>
<p><strong>Drug Addiction Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>The United States has a higher percentage of drug addicts than any other major industrialized nation does.</p>
<p>We love to escape the pain of our every day lives.</p>
<p>At this point, the United States has the highest rate <a title="of illegal drug use" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/01/health/webmd/main4222322.shtml" target="_blank">of illegal drug use</a> in the entire world.</p>
<p>The United States also has a higher percentage of people addicted to <a title="prescription drugs" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/was-whitney-houston-killed-by-prescription-drugs-like-so-many-other-celebrities-have-been">prescription drugs</a> than anyone else does.</p>
<p>So what does that say about us exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Child Abuse Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>In the United States, we treat our children very badly.</p>
<p>Sadly, there are <a title="more than 3 million reports" href="http://www.childhelp.org/pages/statistics" target="_blank">more than 3 million reports</a> of child abuse in the United States every single year, and the United States has the highest <a title="child abuse death rate" href="http://www.allgov.com/Controversies/ViewNews/US_Leads_Developed_World_in_Child_Abuse_Death_Rate_111018" target="_blank">child abuse death rate</a> on the entire globe.</p>
<p><strong>Teen Pregnancy Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>When our kids grow up they tend to be very sexually active as teens.</p>
<p>Amazingly, the United States has the highest <a title="teen pregnancy rate" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_tee_pre_sha-health-teenage-pregnancy-share" target="_blank">teen pregnancy rate</a> on the entire planet.</p>
<p>And all of this sexual activity is rapidly spreading disease among our teens.  According to one study, <a title="one out of every four" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-03-11-std_n.htm" target="_blank">one out of every four</a>teen girls in the United States has at least one sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p><strong>Divorce Epidemic</strong></p>
<p>We like to make movies and television shows about families, but the truth is that the family structure in the United States has been breaking down for a very long time.</p>
<p>Today, the United States has the highest <a title="divorce rate" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/peo_div_rat-people-divorce-rate" target="_blank">divorce rate</a> in the world by a very wide margin.</p>
<p>Some example for the rest of the world we are, eh?</p>
<p><strong>16 Trillion Dollar National Debt</strong></p>
<p>Right now the U.S. national debt is $15,884,155,929,632.05.</p>
<p>We will shortly cross the 16 trillion dollar mark.</p>
<p>This is the greatest debt in the history of the world and it is <a title="beyond criminal" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/27-things-that-every-american-should-know-about-the-national-debt" target="_blank">beyond criminal</a> that we plan to pass this debt on to future generations.</p>
<p>Our greed has destroyed the future for our children and our grandchildren and yet we continue to borrow trillions more because we just can&#8217;t help ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Political Nightmare</strong></p>
<p>On top of everything else, we have a horrifying lack of leadership here in America.</p>
<p>Our last four presidents have been four of the worst presidents in U.S. history, and in 2012 we are faced with an incredibly depressing choice at the polls.</p>
<p>Is Barack Obama really the best that the Democrats can do?</p>
<p>The American people elected an incompetent con man to the highest office in the land.  Virtually every decision that he makes is wrong and virtually everything that he has tried to do while in office has been a failure.</p>
<p>The Republicans dislike Barack Obama so much that they picked the candidate <a title="most like Obama" href="http://ivn.us/2012/07/17/100-ways-mitt-romney-is-just-like-barack-obama/" target="_blank">most like Obama</a> out of the entire Republican field to go up against Obama.</p>
<p>What kind of sense does that make?</p>
<p>Is Mitt Romney really the best that the Republicans can do?</p>
<p>Right now the best selling point that Republicans have for Romney is this&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;You better vote for him or you will get another four years of Obama&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Mitt Romney would certainly also be a <a title="bad president" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/16-reasons-why-mitt-romney-would-be-a-really-really-bad-president">bad president</a> and would lead us down the exact same road that Obama has.</p>
<p>This fall, Americans will either get to vote for the worst president in U.S. history or another guy who will almost certainly be one of the worst presidents in U.S. history.</p>
<p>How depressing is that?</p>
<p>So as this nation continues to fall apart, we are guaranteed to have an absolutely horrible leader in the White House.</p>
<p>Perhaps we are really cursed.</p>
<p>So do you have an opinion about why so many bad things are happening to America?</p>

			<p>For the past few weeks, word of the extent of the Fukushima disaster is spreading like the radiation slick moving across the Pacific Ocean thanks to social media and a lot of newly concerned citizens.</p>
<p>Independent researchers who have been trying to warn people for over a year are finally being heard. Much of that can be attributed to citizen journalists, who have realized mainstream media dropped the ball on this a long time ago.</p>
<p>To understand the dynamics of information and how it has been controlled, you would have to look at companies like General Electric and Westinghouse, who not only build nuclear reactors, but own major news outlets and, of course, are buddy-buddy with the Obama Administration.</p>
<p>Or, I can just tell you about it, since I have spent countless hours researching these connections and interviewing people about it. More on that at a later date. It deserves a nice big page in itself, with room for lots of details.</p>
<p>Not only do we have citizen journalists and the alternative media on top of this, but citizen scientists as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAVSRALX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="imagesCAVSRALX" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAVSRALX.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="149" /></a>Have you met your new Fukushima expert, who just might live right next door? These are people who have taught themselves everything they possibly could about nuclear physics, radiation, Geiger counters, atomic power, nuclear plants, the effects of radiation on health, and <a href="http://fukushimafacts.com/Default.aspx?PID=47&amp;T=Mitigation%20&amp;%20How%20To%20Protect%20Yourself" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">radiation mitigation</a>.</p>
<p>These citizen scientists have studied bombs, fallout, and weather and wind patterns. They have been monitoring radiation levels across the country, with their own equipment they purchased out of pocket and learned how to use.</p>
<p>They have read anything and everything they can get their hands on. They know the difference between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, and how to avoid it.</p>
<p>They know that besides cancer, radiation can do all kinds of things to you, like severely compromise your immune system, intelligence, and thyroid, or make you aggressive, confused, and fatigued.</p>
<p>You might bruise or bleed in weird places and feel sick more than usual. They have learned all this out of their own instincts of survival.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mk_6_nuclear_bomb.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="mk_6_nuclear_bomb" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mk_6_nuclear_bomb-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="181" /></a>Sometimes they even go 2 days without sleep, when bad stuff is happening, just to make sure they are keeping on top of the issues as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s amazing what you can do in a short period of time when your life depends on it. And the more that they learn, the greater their sense of urgency has become in bringing this info to the masses.</p>
<p>And what conclusion have these citizen journalists and citizen scientists reached throughout 14 months of study?</p>
<p>They have come to the inevitable conclusion that all of our lives changed on March 11, 2011, when Fukushima went out of control.</p>
<p>The glaring problem is that we that we weren’t told about what actually happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs_1000lb_5in.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="bombs_1000lb_5in" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs_1000lb_5in-300x245.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="196" /></a>Take, for instance, the fact that there were 3 meltdowns almost right away, and that the radioactive isotopes that blew all over Japan, Hawaii, Alaska, Canada and North America came in extraordinarily high quantities.</p>
<p>Or how various agencies that taxpayers have funded, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), did not do their job which is to protect the environment, and us.</p>
<p>In fact the EPA turned off their monitors for about a month, for the first time in their history. These are expensive and delicate pieces of equipment the taxpayers had already bought and paid for, for just such an emergency.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) knew, but they hid the information. The Obama Administration knew, but sent Hillary Clinton over to Japan to shake hands with the Prime Minister and show support.</p>
<p>Obama came out with a statement to the American people, saying, “We do not believe harmful levels of radiation will reach our shores,” which we now know was a lie.</p>
<p>We had to figure all this out for ourselves, which was difficult because the information was purposely withheld from us.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, they can’t stop the truth from leaking out of Fukushima. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have now proven this beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theory is becoming conspiracy fact. And now we are going public with this information, and in a very big way.</p>
<p>It has been around 3 weeks since I wrote <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/04/21/fukushima-is-falling-apart-are-you-ready/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">my first article</a> for <a href="http://endthelie.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">End the Lie</a>, and still no real progress to report at the plant itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B5390716-Fasciation-SPL.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="Fasciation" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B5390716-Fasciation-SPL-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="243" /></a>Tons of water continues to get poured into the reactors and flow subsequently into the Pacific Ocean, every second of every day.</p>
<p>Radiation continues to steam itself out of the ground, and thus up into the air, which then blows over us (i.e. resident of the northern hemisphere).</p>
<p>Earthquakes still happen daily around Japan. In fact there were 7 or 8 of them just in the past few days near Fukushima.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/05/06/which-will-collapse-first-the-economy-or-the-spent-fuel-pool-at-fukushima/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spent fuel still sits in its shaky nest at the top of reactor number 4</a>. Nothing has been done to further reinforce the structure.</p>
<p>The good news (if you can really call it that) is that it hasn’t fallen yet. The United Nations and the United States are now in their most preliminary stages of addressing the complexity of problems there, in an attempt to see if they can help out.</p>
<p>But as you know, the wheels of bureaucracy turn very slowly. It took almost 14 months for them to start turning at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/smiley-nuclear.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="smiley-nuclear" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/smiley-nuclear-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="185" /></a>Besides the ongoing releases into the ocean and air and the precariousness of the pool, we have a debris field the size of Texas starting to hit the west coast and Alaska, which may or may not be radioactive.</p>
<p>Japan has been burning radioactive trash, and will continue to do so until at least 2014, and that blows over us as well.</p>
<p>We have a radioactive slick moving across the ocean, which by all estimates should have sunk to the bottom, but hasn’t. And we have sick and dying mammals, fish, and birds all over the world, which may or may not be related, but should still be an enormous concern, since many of them are being found in the Pacific.</p>
<p>That is part of the problem when you are faced with the world’s largest disaster. All of the models for how to deal with it can be thrown out the window.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/radiation-umbrella.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="radiation-umbrella" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/radiation-umbrella-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="191" /></a>All the assumptions about fallout and it working itself into the food chain have been wrong. It was much worse, and has happened much faster, than anyone expected, even for concerned citizens and independent researchers following this closely.</p>
<p>The government knew this would be the case from the early SPEEDI numbers, which were hand translated and delivered to the US government as they happened. But for the most part, Fukushima has exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p>
<p>New ideas, new techniques, and new engineering has to be invented and implemented. New observations have to be made, and they are, as can be seen by searching “mutations” on YouTube and watching some videos.</p>
<p>We have citizen journalists and citizen scientists who are desperately trying to come up with solutions, and are doing it for free, while our government and agencies created to “protect us” continue to collect their paycheck, roll their eyes, shove their hands in their pockets and hum a tune like they’re waiting for a taxi.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/page11_obama_nuclear.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="page11_obama_nuclear" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/page11_obama_nuclear-300x249.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="224" /></a>But out of crisis, comes opportunity. I’ll use 9/11 again as an example.</p>
<p>Why do people get a warm fuzzy feeling when we see people rushing to aid those in the midst of disaster? Because we humans are hard-wired to care for others, and long to be part of a community.</p>
<p>Out of disaster, there is camaraderie, sympathy, and empathy. There are important lessons to be learned.</p>
<p>There are whole new industries that could be created out of this crisis, putting people to work. Aquaponics. Decontamination. Mitigation. Food testing.</p>
<p>And since we didn’t seem to learn these lessons with Chernobyl, we need to learn them right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs-away.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="bombs-away" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs-away-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" /></a>All nuclear power does is boil water and create steam, which turbines turn into electricity. But when something goes wrong, it has the ability to kill everything on the planet. That is where we are at now.</p>
<p>We need to adapt if we are to survive. And part of that adaptation means we need to eliminate the possibility of this ever happening again, starting with the 23 reactors the same style as Fukushima, in the United States, which is the Mark 1 Boiling Water Reactor, or BWR.</p>
<p>People in the industry jokingly refer to these as “double-decker beach-bombs,” for the reason that the spent fuel is located in pools at the top of the reactor buildings, and they are usually located at a water source for emergency cooling purposes for when the fecal matter hits the fan at one of these plants.</p>
<p>In fact, several nuclear engineers who designed these reactors quit in protest before they went into production. They realized they had made a mistake. They realized this design would be extremely dangerous. GE went ahead and built them anyway.</p>
<p>When is the world going to realize the mistake of embracing nuclear energy as a power source, in spite of its danger?</p>
<p>And how long do we continue to ignore the brilliant scientists that warned about this, like Oppenheimer and Einstein? Or is it already too late?</p>
<div></div>
<p>There are no energy problems, in comparison. If you want to cut down on your electricity usage, turn off your TV.</p>
<p>We have natural gas deposits that could power everything we need. We have the power of the sun, water, wind and earth in the form of geothermal energy.</p>
<p>Nuclear power is a sham, just like the oil industry, and we have been duped into believing we need it to survive.</p>
<p>It generates billions and billions of dollars for these corporations. GE (who has the most ironic motto, “We Bring Good Things to Life”) made 14 billion dollars last year, and paid no taxes.</p>
<p>In addition to producing electricity, nuclear reactors also generate 500 pounds of plutonium a year per reactor, as a byproduct of the fission process.</p>
<p>What happens to all that highly toxic plutonium? The government gets to collect this material to make bombs, so we can go utterly decimate other countries, now known as “spreading democracy” and poison their populations for future generations.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget depleted uranium, or DU, which is now used in many military applications with horrific results.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/iraq-war-child.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="iraq-war-child" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/iraq-war-child-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="164" /></a>Check out videos of children in Fallujah for some recent examples of this.</p>
<p>This is the one big secret that the nuke industry and our government will do anything to protect: besides being a billion dollar industry, nuke plants are basically bomb-making factories right under our noses.</p>
<p>Drawing attention to Fukushima would have drawn attention to this function of nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>An added side effect is that they also make people sick and help boost the health care industry, which in some states is now the number one private sector employer.</p>
<p>The plutonium and fission byproducts these plants produce help support our government’s number-one priority: the almighty military-industrial complex.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAQ3GNQ3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="imagesCAQ3GNQ3" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAQ3GNQ3.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="164" /></a>And it’s all in the name of money, power, and control. Energy companies hire top level advertisers and public relations people to promote and manipulate public opinion. Even during the Superbowl, ads were run showing how steam from nuclear power runs the turbines that make beer.</p>
<p>They want you to believe that we are dependent on this source of energy for our quality of life. The truth of the matter, on the other hand, is that nuclear power has ruined our lives.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who used to live in the ever-expanding evacuation zone in Japan, which may soon include the 35 million people in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who lives near a nuke plant and has a child with autism, gastroenteritis, or cancer. Just take a look at the statistics of cancer in the general population since we started embracing this technology.</p>
<p>The truth is: we have been nuked and are still getting nuked, every day, in a very big way.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nuke-parade-small.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="nuke-parade-small" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nuke-parade-small-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="179" /></a>I used to be a huge supporter of nuclear power, but 14 months of intensive study has changed my opinion significantly.</p>
<p>In addition to my studies, I have been influenced by some major health issues I developed after being outside the first 3 weeks after the reactors exploded. During that time I had a metallic-taste in my mouth, which I found out later was from tasting fission products. More on that later as well.</p>
<p>Nuclear cheerleaders like to complicate things in an attempt to make radiation something much harder to understand. That way it turns people off from the subject and they won’t pay attention as much.</p>
<p>The truth is, you don’t need to be a physicist, a scientist, or an expert in this field. You don’t need to know the differences between decay rates and half-lives, or cesium and strontium.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a>You only need to understand one thing: All radiation is bad, and all of it will make you sick, no matter how much Ann Coulter claims that the Japanese should be thankful for Fukushima.</p>
<p>The more you are exposed to it, the sicker you will be. The more places you can cut down on your exposure, the better off your health will be.</p>
<p>Radiation is cumulative. It builds up in the body. It destroys cells. It causes mutations in cell growth which can thus create cancer or other illnesses.</p>
<p>There is plenty of this radiation leaking out of Fukushima for over a year now, blowing around in our air, building up in our soil, and contaminating our water supply.</p>
<p>What’s worse, we have 104 of these plants in the United States, with special emphasis on the 23 previously mentioned, where this exact scenario is waiting to happen.</p>
<div id="attachment_45328"></div>
<p>Radioactive steam comes out of these plants all the time, since as part of their normal operations. They vent to the atmosphere to keep things cool. Do some research into “rainshadow” in autism and brain cancer in children, and look where the numbers are the highest: around nuclear plants.</p>
<p>We can’t afford to wait or delay. If you aren’t already mitigating, you need to start now. You need to treat your health, and the health of your family, like you all have cancer already. That might sound like fear mongering to some, but this is one case where “better safe than sorry” truly applies.</p>
<p>This process involves eating healthy whole foods, filtering water, avoiding precipitation, taking supplements, and getting lots of sleep.</p>
<p>Stop eating fast food, and eat lower on the food chain, where bio-accumulation is less. Stop eating seafood, unless you know it is safe.</p>
<p>Include your children in these changes, because we will be dealing with this problem for at least the rest of our lives, and so will they.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600-213x300.jpg" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a>We have to change our perspective. Quality of life becomes a much more important issue when your life expectancy has been shortened.</p>
<p>We have Fukushima to thank for this, and the nuclear industry, of course. As well as the various other individuals or agencies that tried to keep this information from us.</p>
<p>And then of course we have spent fuel pool doom lurking in the shadows. And for some unknown reason, Tepco seems to think their most immediate concern is building a huge underground wall, to contain something going on under the plant, the extent of which hasn’t yet been shared with us.</p>
<p>So what do they know that we don’t? Why is there a sense of urgency to contain something underground, when the spent fuel pool #4 is supposedly the weakest link in the Fukushima chain?</p>
<p>Where is all this technology we have to look for gas and oil, like ground-penetrating radar, optical coherence tomography, or even HAARP, to see what’s going on under the plants? What else is being hidden from us?</p>
<p>Instead of calling it game over, let’s play a new game called “No More Fukushimas.”</p>
<p>Let’s figure out ways to clean up this mess and not make more of them in the future. We can leave this for our children to deal with, that is if they are still here.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AJ201109069466.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="AJ201109069466" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AJ201109069466-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="179" /></a>Or it is up to you, it is up to me, it is up to <strong>all</strong>of us to fix this situation, right now, as best as we possibly can.</p>
<p>Take care of your family first, have a plan for the worst-case scenario, then do what you can to help others.</p>
<p>Our lives all changed over a year ago, only you weren’t told about it. As bad as things are, there is a huge opportunity here for something wonderful to come out of this mess. A cleaner, brighter, healthier future for our children and generations to come. A future, period.</p>
<p>As a close associate of Obama once said, “Never let a crisis go to waste”. This might be the last crisis that we ever see, if we don’t so something about it.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/deesjapanesenuclearcatastrope2.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/deesjapanesenuclearcatastrope2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Mounting troubles at Japan&#8217;s hobbled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant now pose a real threat to human survival. If the area in which Unit 4 is struck by another 7.0 magnitude earthquake, there&#8217;s a 70 percent chance that &#8220;the entire fuel pool structure will collapse&#8221; and massive doses of lethal nuclear radiation will be released into the atmosphere. The disaster would release approximately &#8220;134 million curies is Cesium-137 — roughly 85 times the amount of Cs-137 released at Chernobyl as estimated by the U.S. National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP).&#8221; Experts believe that the amounts are sufficient to &#8220;destroy the world environment and our civilization&#8221;, which makes containment &#8220;an issue of human survival.&#8221; <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/04/the-largest-short-term-threat-to-humanity-the-fuel-pools-of-fukushima.html">(&#8220;The Greatest Single Threat to Humanity: Fuel Pool Number 4&#8243;, Washington&#8217;s blog)</a></p>
<p>The structural integrity of Unit 4&#8242;s cooling pool was greatly compromised by the earthquake and following tsunami which struck the facility over a year ago. At present, the pools are not adequately protected or reinforced, which means that a sizable tremor could &#8220;cause a disaster worse than the three reactor meltdowns.&#8221; If such a disaster were to occur, &#8220;people should get out of Japan, and residents of the West Coast of America and Canada should shut all of their windows and stay inside,&#8221; says nuclear expert Arnie Gundersen.</p>
<p>While the danger to life and the environment pose the greatest single national security threat the United States has faced since WW2, the Obama administration has provided little aid to the emergency effort. Japan is largely &#8220;going it alone&#8221; trying to cobble together a plan to safely store the spent fuel and minimize the risks to public safety.</p>
<p>On March 8, 2012, Dr. Hiroaki Koide, Research Associate at the Research Reactor Institute of Kyoto University, gave his bleak assessment of the situation on the Japanese a news program called, “Morning Bird”. Koide explained how 1,500 rods are presently located in a &#8220;fuel pool&#8221; that has been severely damaged. The rods have to be cooled constantly or a &#8220;huge amount of radiation contained in the spent fuel will be released outside&#8221;. If an earthquake hits and undermines the pool, the coolant will exit the pool, the rods will melt and radioactive plumes will rise into the atmosphere. Koide explained that the rods could not be safely removed from the existing pool because &#8220;if you hoist them up in the air, huge amount of radiation will come out from the spent fuel and people nearby will die.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the journalists on &#8220;Morning Bird” asked Koide what would happen if the Unit was struck by another earthquake?</p>
<p>Koide answered, &#8220;That will be the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The end,&#8221; the journalist asked, visibly shaken?</p>
<p>&#8220;The end,&#8221; Koide repeated emphatically. (&#8220;Fukushima Dai-Ichi No. 4: An earthquake before spent fuel rods are moved to safe storage would be “the end”, Lambert Strether, Naked Capitalism)</p>
<p>Now, check this out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Japan’s former Ambassador to Switzerland, Mr. Mitsuhei Murata&#8230; strongly stated that if the crippled building of reactor unit 4—with 1,535 fuel rods in the spent fuel pool 100 feet (30 meters) above the ground—collapses, not only will it cause a shutdown of all six reactors but it will also affect the common spent fuel pool containing 6,375 fuel rods, located some 50 meters from reactor 4. In both cases the radioactive rods are not protected by a containment vessel; dangerously, they are open to the air. This would certainly cause a global catastrophe like we have never before experienced. &#8230; Such a catastrophe would affect us all for centuries.&#8221;<br />
(&#8220;Fukushima Daiichi Site: Cesium-137 is 85 times greater than at Chernobyl Accident&#8221;, akiomatsumura.com)</p>
<p>Murata&#8217;s concerns have been brought to the attention of the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, to high-ranking officials in the Obama administration and EU, and to leaders around the world. The reaction has basically been the same everywhere, which is, &#8220;It&#8217;s Japan&#8217;s problem. Let them deal with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no way to overstate the media&#8217;s complicity in concealing critical information about the tragedy that is presently unfolding at Fukushima. If there is another earthquake, the media will certainly be every bit as responsible as the government officials who saw the danger, but chose to do nothing.</p>

			<p><strong>23 Things That Are Not What They Seem To Be On Television&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Mainstream-Media-Lies-23-Things-That-Are-Not-What-They-Seem-To-Be-On-Television-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="225" />Most Americans believe the lie that the mainstream media is &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; and is looking out for the interests of average Americans.  Well, that simply is not true.  Those in the mainstream media serve those that are providing them with paychecks.  The reality is that just <a title="6 gigantic corporations" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/who-owns-the-media-the-6-monolithic-corporations-that-control-almost-everything-we-watch-hear-and-read" target="_blank">6 gigantic corporations</a>collectively own most of the major mainstream media outlets in this country.  Reporters are simply not going to be allowed to report stories that are severely damaging to those corporations or to the owners of those corporations.  In addition, reporters are simply not going to be allowed to report stories that are severely damaging to those that spend millions of dollars on advertising (such as pharmaceutical companies) on those mainstream media outlets.  At this point, our &#8220;news&#8221; is absolutely packed with propaganda.  Way too often, things are not what they seem to be on television.  The mainstream media lies, lies and then lies some more.  They give us the version of &#8220;reality&#8221; that their owners want us to have.</p>
<p>The following are 23 things that are not what they seem to be on television&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Mitt Romney won Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> <a title="Mitt Romney" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/17-reasons-why-a-vote-for-mitt-romney-is-a-vote-for-the-new-world-order">Mitt Romney</a> may not have won Iowa.  The following report of a documented vote discrepancy comes <a title="from KCCI" href="http://www.kcci.com/r/30144582/detail.html#ixzz1idnQZDJ8" target="_blank">from KCCI</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Edward True, 28, of Moulton, said he helped count the votes and jotted the results down on a piece of paper to post to his Facebook page. He said when he checked to make sure the Republican Party of Iowa got the count right, he said he was shocked to find they hadn&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;When Mitt Romney won Iowa by eight votes and I&#8217;ve got a 20-vote discrepancy here, that right there says Rick Santorum won Iowa,&#8221; True said. &#8220;Not Mitt Romney.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>True said at his 53-person caucus at the Garrett Memorial Library, Romney received two votes. According to the Iowa Republican Party&#8217;s website, True&#8217;s precinct cast 22 votes for Romney.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So how many other &#8220;vote discrepancies&#8221; were there in Iowa?  Was this just a &#8220;coincidence&#8221; or did someone do this on purpose?</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Barack Obama will be much different from George W. Bush and will actually protect our civil liberties.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Under Barack Obama we have lost even more of our civil liberties than we did under George W. Bush.  Barack Obama recently signed <a title="a new law" href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s1867pcs/pdf/BILLS-112s1867pcs.pdf" target="_blank">a new law</a>that gives the U.S. military the power to arrest U.S. citizens on American soil, detain them indefinitely and ship them off to Guantanamo Bay for endless &#8220;interrogation&#8221; sessions.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> SOPA is all about cracking down on international sellers of counterfeit goods.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> SOPA is all about <a title="censoring the Internet" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/why-we-must-stop-sopa">censoring the Internet</a> and cracking down on websites that the federal government does not like.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The U.S. unemployment rate is now at <a title="8.5%" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-06/Obama-jobs/52417786/1" target="_blank">8.5%</a> and will continue to fall as the U.S. economy recovers.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> If the number of Americans considered to be &#8220;looking for work&#8221; was the same today as it was back in 2007, the &#8220;official&#8221; unemployment rate put out by the U.S. government would about <a title="11 percent" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/wonkbook-the-real-unemployment-rate-is-11-percent/2011/12/12/gIQAuctPpO_blog.html" target="_blank">11 percent</a>, and the U.S. <a title="middle class" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/30-statistics-that-show-that-the-middle-class-is-dying-right-in-front-of-our-eyes-as-we-enter-2012" target="_blank">middle class</a>continues to be systematically destroyed right in front of our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The debt crisis in Europe has been stabilized and the euro is going to be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The debt crisis in Europe continues <a title="to get worse" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/look-out-below-the-nightmarish-decline-of-the-euro-has-begun" target="_blank">to get worse</a> and the euro is<a title="dropping like a rock" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-euro-is-getting-crushed-right-now-2012-1" target="_blank">dropping like a rock</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The U.S. stock market is in great shape and is poised to soar to new heights in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Investors are pulling money out of stocks at an alarming rate.  In fact, as CNBC <a title="recently noted" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/45901437" target="_blank">recently noted</a>, investors have pulled more money out of mutual funds than they have put into mutual funds for 9 weeks in a row.  A lot of people out there expect that something really bad is going to happen very soon&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Investors yanked money out of U.S. equity mutual funds for a ninth-consecutive week despite a bullish 2012 outlook from Wall Street and a December rally that’s carried over into the New Year.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> There are no plans to replace the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Top financial authorities all over the world have been developing plans for a <a title="new global currency" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/now-that-u-s-government-debt-has-been-downgraded-the-rest-of-the-world-is-calling-even-louder-for-a-new-global-currency">new global currency</a> for a long time.  The following comes from a<a title="CNN article" href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/10/markets/dollar/index.htm" target="_blank">CNN article</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The International Monetary Fund issued a report Thursday on a possible replacement for the dollar as the world&#8217;s reserve currency.<strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em>The IMF said Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs, could help stabilize the global financial system.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> There is not a municipal bond crisis in America.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> There is a growing municipal bond crisis in America.  Over the last several months a whole host of municipal bonds have been downgraded.  Just today, Moody&#8217;s downgraded Illinois government debt <a title="from A2 to A" href="http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2012/01/moodys-cuts-illinois-bond-rating.html" target="_blank">from A2 to A</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Chicago is a safe place to live.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> <a title="14 people" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-3-wounded-in-west-side-shooting-20120105,0,7068594.story" target="_blank">14 people</a> were shot across the Chicago area on Thursday alone.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Federal employees are not overpaid.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The federal government is advertising for an &#8220;invitations coordinator&#8221; that will make <a title="between $53,500 and $102,900" href="http://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/306225500" target="_blank">between $53,500 and $102,900</a> per year.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs are bad for the environment and it is a good thing that the federal government is requiring that they be<a title="phased out" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/story/2011-12-28/light-bulb-rules/52256656/1?csp=hf" target="_blank">phased out</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The new <a title="CFL light bulbs" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/federal-bureaucrats-get-your-dirty-hands-off-of-our-light-bulbs" target="_blank">CFL light bulbs</a> are filled with mercury, they are an environmental nightmare and they are incredibly toxic and dangerous if they are broken.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The U.S. education system is producing a huge crop of really sharp students who are prepared to be the leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The U.S. education system is <a title="a complete and total joke" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/28-signs-that-u-s-public-schools-are-rapidly-being-turned-into-indoctrination-centers-and-prison-camps">a complete and total joke</a>.  It is producing millions of students that are not prepared to face the real world at all.  The following is a short excerpt from a recent article by Mac Slavo that many of you will find illuminating&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Economics Professor Jack Chambless of Valencia College in Florida had his sophomore students write a short essay on what the American dream means to them and what, specifically, they wanted the federal government to do to help them achieve that dream.</p>
<p>The results demonstrate the sheer magnitude of the idiocy of a public education system dead set on indoctrination rather than education:</p>
<blockquote><p>I took the essays from three classes – about 180 students…</p>
<p>About 10% of the students said they wanted the government to leave them alone and not tax them too much and let them regulate their own lives.</p>
<p>But over 80% of the students said that the American dream to them meant a job, a house, and plenty of money for retirement and vacations and things like this. <strong>When it came to the part about the federal government, eight out of ten students said they wanted free health care, they wanted the government to pay for their tuition, they wanted the government to pay for the down payment on their house, they expected the government to, quote, “give them a job.” Many of them said they wanted the government to tax wealthier individuals so that they would have an opportunity to have a better life.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The following is an excerpt from one of the non-sensical essays written by a student of Professor Chambless:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“As human beings, we are not really responsible for our own acts, and so we need government to control those who don’t care about others.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>You can read the rest of that article <a title="right here" href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/plundering-the-american-dream-college-students-demonstrate-the-idiocy-of-our-education-system_01052012" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Specific social and political agendas are not promoted in U.S. public schools.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> According to <a title="CNSNews.com" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/california-public-school-kids-now-required-study-contributions-lgbt-americans" target="_blank">CNSNews.com</a>, a new California law makes it mandatory for all public school children to be taught the &#8220;role and contributions&#8221; that &#8220;lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans&#8221; have played in the &#8220;development of California and the United States of America.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> We have to send our troops overseas to fight the terrorists &#8220;over there&#8221; or else they will come and fight us over here.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Dozens of jihadist training camps are operating inside the United States right now and the federal government could not care less.  The following is from a recent <a title="WorldNetDaily article" href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/01/381953/" target="_blank">WorldNetDaily article</a> about a jihadist organization that is operating 35 training camps on U.S. soil right now&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Jamaat ul-Fuqra, known in the U.S. as “Muslims of America,” has purchased or leased hundreds of acres of property – from New York to California – in which the leader, Sheikh Mubarak Gilani, boasts of conducting “the most advanced training courses in Islamic military warfare.”</em></p>
<p><em>In a recruitment video captured from Gilani’s “Soldiers of Allah,” he states in English: “We are fighting to destroy the enemy. We are dealing with evil at its roots and its roots are America.”</em></p>
<p><em>Though Gilani and his organization is suspected of committing assassinations and firebombings inside the U.S., and is also suspected of the beheading murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, the terrorist camps spread through the country continue to expand in numbers and population.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But apparently Islamic terror is only a &#8220;problem&#8221; when the federal government wants to use it to justify invading another country.</p>
<p>In fact, there have been several instances where the U.S. government has actually allied with al-Qaeda in order to overthrow governments.  The latest example of this <a title="was in Libya" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/thanks-obama-the-al-qaeda-flag-is-flying-high-and-proud-over-libya">was in Libya</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Our politicians know exactly what they are doing and they have a plan for getting <a title="U.S. debt" href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/34-shocking-facts-about-u-s-debt-that-should-set-america-on-fire-with-anger" target="_blank">U.S. debt</a> under control.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> When Ronald Reagan took office, the U.S. national debt was less than <a title="1 trillion dollars" href="http://www.savingsbonds.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm" target="_blank">1 trillion dollars</a>.  Today, the U.S. national debt is over <a title="15.2 trillion dollars" href="http://www.savingsbonds.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np" target="_blank">15.2 trillion dollars</a>.  In spite of all this, the American people keep sending the same big spenders back to Washington D.C. over and over and over.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The Obama administration is enforcing our immigration laws.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The Obama administration has instituted &#8220;<a title="backdoor amnesty" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/barack-obama-cannot-get-congress-to-pass-amnesty-for-illegal-immigrants-so-now-he-is-just-going-to-ram-it-down-our-throats-any-way-that-he-can">backdoor amnesty</a>&#8221; for illegal immigrants and even plans to provide them with <a title="work permits" href="http://www.numbersusa.com/content/news/august-19-2011/obama-official-illegal-aliens-will-receive-work-permits.html" target="_blank">work permits</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The number of earthquakes is not increasing.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The number of earthquakes is increasing <a title="dramatically" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/major-earth-changes-coming-earthquakes-are-becoming-much-more-frequent-and-much-more-powerful">dramatically</a>.  As the &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221; continues <a title="to wake up" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/is-the-magnitude-8-9-earthquake-in-japan-a-sign-that-the-ring-of-fire-is-coming-to-life">to wake up</a> the next few years could be very, very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The nuclear crisis at Fukushima is under control and things are getting back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Large areas around Fukushima will be uninhabitable for the indefinite future.  Back in April, I published an article entitled &#8220;<a title="Much Of Northern Japan Uninhabitable Due To Nuclear Radiation?" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/much-of-northern-japan-uninhabitable-due-to-nuclear-radiation">Much Of Northern Japan Uninhabitable Due To Nuclear Radiation?</a>&#8221;  At the time, almost everyone in the mainstream media was insisting that Fukushima was nothing like Chernobyl and that those that lived near Fukushima would be able to return to their homes fairly soon.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that those of us that feared the worst were right after all.  Just consider the following quote from <a title="the New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/world/asia/22japan.html?_r=2" target="_blank">the New York Times</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Broad areas around the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant could soon be declared uninhabitable, perhaps for decades, after a government survey found radioactive contamination that far exceeded safe levels, several major media outlets said Monday.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Fluoride is good for our teeth and we should put huge amounts of it into our drinking water.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Fluoride is a very toxic sedative and can be very harmful to the teeth.  Incredibly, even the federal government is finally admitting that high levels of fluoride in our drinking water can be harmful.  In fact, the feds have reduced the &#8220;recommended amount&#8221; of fluoride in our drinking water for the first time in 50 years.</p>
<p>We probably won&#8217;t see them ban fluoride any time soon, but for them to even acknowledge a problem with fluoride is a major step.  <a title="In a recent article on CNN" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/07/fluoride.recommendations/?hpt=T2" target="_blank">In a recent article on CNN</a>, it was reported that the federal government is now saying that high levels of fluoride in the water have now officially been linked with fluorosis&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Department of Health and Human Services and Environmental Protection Agency are proposing the change because of an increase in fluorosis &#8212; a condition that causes spotting and streaking on children&#8217;s teeth.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Using cell phones is perfectly safe and they do not cause cancer.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Using cell phones can definitely increase your risk for cancer.  Some very startling scientific studies have come out recently that are hard to ignore.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt <a title="from one recent CNN article" href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/14/cell.phones.brain.tumor/index.html" target="_blank">from a recent CNN article</a> about one of these studies&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>At the highest exposure levels &#8212; using a mobile phone half an hour a day over a 10-year period &#8212; the study found a 40 percent increased risk of glioma brain tumors.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The federal government works very hard to keep dangerous prescription drugs from ever entering the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> America&#8217;s addiction <a title="to prescription drugs" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/18-crazy-facts-that-show-that-no-nation-on-earth-is-more-doped-up-on-prescription-drugs-that-america-is">to prescription drugs</a> is getting a lot of people put into the ground.  Adverse reactions to prescription drugs kill a huge number of Americans every year.  A recent Vanity Fair article entitled &#8220;<a title="Deadly Medicine" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/01/deadly-medicine-201101" target="_blank">Deadly Medicine</a>&#8221; began with the following statement&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Prescription drugs kill some 200,000 Americans every year. Will that number go up, now that most clinical trials are conducted overseas—on sick Russians, homeless Poles, and slum-dwelling Chinese—in places where regulation is virtually nonexistent, the F.D.A. doesn’t reach, and “mistakes” can end up in pauper’s graves?</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> Members of Congress work really hard to fix the problems that this country is facing.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Members of Congress work an average of about <a title="two and a half days per week" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/you-wont-believe-these-statistics-which-show-how-corrupt-lazy-and-stinking-rich-our-congress-critters-have-become">two and a half days per week</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Lie:</strong> The United States has the best health care system in the world.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The United States spends far more on health care than anyone else in the world, but we <a title="rank 50th" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html" target="_blank">rank 50th</a> in life expectancy, 47 countries have a lower infant mortality rate <a title="than we do" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html" target="_blank">than we do</a> and the federal government is chasing millions of good doctors <a title="out of the medical profession" href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/no-doctor-for-you-how-the-federal-government-is-chasing-millions-of-good-doctors-out-of-the-medical-profession">out of the medical profession</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/clocks-reuters3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/clocks-reuters2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The Private Global Power Elite embedded in major governments is dead set on imposing World Government on us sooner rather than later. Let’s look at 12 mega-processes – veritable “Triggers” – that we infer they are using to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>All roads lead to World Government.  This should come as no surprise.  London’s Financial Times openly articulated this view in an article by their chief foreign affairs commentator, Gideon Rachman, published on 8 December 2009, whose title said it all: “And Now for a World Government.” These goals are echoed by the Trilateral Commission, CFR and Bilderberg insiders – even by the Vatican.</p>
<p>Macro-managing planet Earth is no easy matter. It requires strategic and tactical planning by a vast think-tank network allied to major elite universities whereby armies of academics, operators, lobbyists, media players and government officers interface, all abundantly financed by the global corporate and banking superstructure.</p>
<p>They do this holistically, knowing that they operate on different stages moving at very different speeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Triggers move at lightning speed thanks to electronic information technology that can make or break markets, currencies and entire countries in just hours or days;</li>
<li>Economic Triggers move slower: manufacturing cars, aircraft, food, clothes, building plants and houses takes months;</li>
<li>Political Triggers tied to the “democratic system” put politicians in power for several years;</li>
<li>Cultural Triggers require entire generations to implement; this is where PsyWar has reached unprecedented “heights”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Risk-managing this whole process takes into account the many pitfalls and surprises in store.  So each plan in every field counts, with “Plan B’s” – even Plans “C” and “D” – which can be implemented if needed.</p>
<h3>Twelve Triggers for World Government</h3>
<p>Today, the Global Power Elite are wrapping up globalization and ushering in World Government.  Paraphrasing the tightrope walker in German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” this implies “….a dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting…&#8221;</p>
<p>These 12 Triggers are interlinked and interlocked in a highly complex, holistic matrix, very flexible in its tactics but rigidly unbending in its strategic objectives. When read as a whole, the picture that unfolds shows that whole being far more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>1) Financial Meltdown. Since 2008, the Global Financial System continues on life-support. Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner and the US economic hit team – Robert Rubin, Larry Summers and Goldman Sachs, CitiGroup, JPMorganChase mega-bankers working with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank – have not and will not take any measures to help the populace and ailing economies.  They just funnel trillions to the banking elite, imposing the media myth that certain banks are “too big to fail” (Orwellian Newspeak for “too damn powerful to fail”). Why? Because it’s not governments overseeing, supervising and controlling Goldman Sachs, CitiCorp, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, JPMorganChase, but exactly the other way around…</p>
<p>2) Economic Crises.  Today, “Destructive Extreme Capitalism” is collapsing national and regional economies, reformatting them into international slave-labour Gulag-like entities that Joseph Stalin would envy.   Our woes lie not with the world’s real economy (mostly intact), but with the fake world of finance, banks, and speculation;</p>
<p>3) Social Upheavals.  Meltdowns in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Iceland and – soon to come – Italy, Spain and others, trigger violent social uprisings, even in the US and UK;</p>
<p>4) Pandemics.  Get ready for more “flu surprises” leading to mandatory vaccinations: a discreet opportunity to slip RFID chips into our bodies and test “intelligent viruses” targeting specific DNA strains.  Racially and ethnically selective viruses as part of mass depopulation campaigns?</p>
<p>5) Global Warming. As the global economy sinks into zero growth mode, economic drivers shift from growth expansion to consumption contraction. Will coming “carbon credits” open the path to full societal control?</p>
<p>6) Terrorist “False Flag” Mega-Attacks. The Elite have this wildcard up their sleeve to jump-start new “crises” as short-cuts towards world government.  Will new “attacks” dwarfing 9/11 justify further global wars, invasions and genocide?  A nuclear weapon over a major city to be blamed on the Elite’s “enemies”?</p>
<p>7) Generalized War in the Middle East. As we speak, naval forces, bombers, entire armies are poised to attack and invade Syria, Iran…</p>
<p>8 ) Ecological/Environmental “Accidents”. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident sparked the beginning of the end of the former USSR by showing the world and the Soviets themselves that their State could no longer manage their own nuclear facilities.  April 2010 saw the BP “Deepwater Horizon” oil rig eco-catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico; since March 2011, Japan and the world have been grappling with a much larger nuclear accident in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex.  Was foul play involved?</p>
<p>9) Assassination of a major political or religious figure to be blamed on an Elite enemy.  Mossad, CIA, MI6 are really good at playing this type of dirty trick;</p>
<p>10) Attacks on “Rogue States” – Iraq, Libya… Who’s next? Iran? Syria?  Venezuela?  North Korea?</p>
<p>11) Staged “Religious” Event. The growing need of the masses for meaning in their lives makes them easy victims of a Hollywood-staged, 3D virtual reality hologram show, orchestrating a “second coming”.  An electronically engineered “messianic figure” acting in sync with Elite global objectives?   Who would dare go against God himself?</p>
<p>12) Staged “Alien Contact.” This too may be in the works.  For decades, large sectors of world population have been programmed to believe in aliens.  Here too, hologram technology could stage a “space vehicle landing” – on the White House lawn, of course – highlighting the “need” for Mankind to have “unified representation” in the face of extraterrestrials.  Further justification for world government?<br />
What do such interlocking “crises” have in common? Global warming, pandemics, “international terrorism”, financial collapse, economic depression, even alien contacts?  They all serve to show that they cannot be addressed by any single nation state, thus “justifying” the need for World Government.<br />
2012: We must stay especially alert, understanding things the way they really are and not the way the global TV Masters want us to believe they are.</p>

<strong>A solar disaster isn&#8217;t a question of if, but when&#8211;and it looks like soon</strong>
</div>
<p>One of the biggest disasters we face would begin about 18 hours after the sun spit out a 10-billion-ton ball of plasma&#8211;something it has done before and is sure to do again. When the ball, a charged cloud of particles called a coronal mass ejection (CME), struck the Earth, electrical currents would spike through the power grid. Transformers would be destroyed. Lights would go out. Food would spoil and&#8211;since the entire transportation system would also be shut down&#8211;go unrestocked.</p>
<p>Within weeks, backup generators at nuclear power plants would have run down, and the electric pumps that supply water to cooling ponds, where radioactive spent fuel rods are stored, would shut off. Multiple meltdowns would ensue. “Imagine 30 Chernobyls across the U.S.,” says electrical engineer John Kappenman, an expert on the grid’s vulnerability to space weather. A CME big enough to take out a chunk of the grid is what scientists and insurers call a high-consequence, low-frequency event. Many space-weather scientists say the Earth is due for one soon. Although CMEs can strike anytime, they are closely correlated to highs in the 11-year sunspot cycle. The current cycle will peak in July 2013.</p>
<p>The most powerful CME in recorded history occurred during a solar cycle with a peak similar to the one scientists are predicting in 2013. During the so-called Carrington Event in 1859, electrical discharges in the U.S. shocked telegraph operators and set their machines on fire. A CME in 1921 disrupted radio across the East Coast and telephone operations in most of Europe. In a 2008 National Academy of Sciences report, scientists estimated that a 1921-level storm could knock out 350 transformers on the American grid, leaving 130 million people without electricity. Replacing broken transformers would take a long time because most require up to two years to manufacture.</p>
<p>Once outside power is lost, nuclear plants have diesel generators that can pump water to spent-fuel cooling pools for up to 30 days. The extent of the meltdown threat is well-documented. A month before the Fukushima plant in Japan went offline in March, the Foundation for Resilient Societies, a committee of engineers, filed a petition with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommending the augmentation of nuclear plants’ emergency backup systems. The petition claims that a severe solar storm would be far worse than a 9.0-magnitude quake and could leave about two thirds of the country’s nuclear plants without power for one to two years.</p>
<p>Preventing a surge from a CME would be costly. With enough warning (at least a few hours, probably), power companies could shut transformers off entirely, turning them back on after the storm. But shutting down the grid on such a large scale would cost billions. To confidently do so, forecasting must be accurate.</p>
<p>Last October, NASA scientists announced its Solar Shield program to monitor solar eruptions and predict storms. Though a good step, the system uses a satellite that was launched in 1997 and designed to run just five years. No other country has anything similar, or as advanced.</p>
<p>Our backup systems aren’t in place yet, either. The Department of Homeland Security is funding the development of an emergency replacement transformer, but it won’t be field-ready for several years. Kappenman has developed a $100,000 capacitor to block storm-induced surges, but these are unproven in emergency situations. “A massive solar storm is a ‘low probability’ event the same way a 100-year flood is,” Thomas Popik, the author of the NRC petition, says. “Just as we build levees to protect against 100-year floods, we need to build protection against 100-year solar storms.”</p>

			<p><img title="12 Things That The Mainstream Media Is Being Strangely Quiet About Right Now" src="http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/12-Things-That-The-Mainstream-Media-Is-Being-Strangely-Quiet-About-Right-Now-250x187.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="187" />As the mainstream media continues to be obsessed with Anthony Weiner and his bizarre adventures on Twitter, much more serious events are happening around the world that are getting very little attention.  In America today, if the mainstream media does not cover something it is almost as if it never happened. Right now, the worst nuclear disaster in human history continues to unfold in Japan , U.S. nuclear facilities are being threatened by flood waters, the U.S. military is bombing Yemen, gigantic cracks in the earth are appearing all over the globe and the largest wildfire in Arizona history is causing immense devastation.  But Anthony Weiner, Bristol Palin and Miss USA are what the mainstream media want to tell us about and most Americans are buying it.</p>
<p>In times like these, it is more important than ever to think for ourselves.  The corporate-owned mainstream media is not interested in looking out for us.  Rather, they are going to tell us whatever fits with the agenda that their owners are pushing.</p>
<p>That is why more Americans than ever are turning to the alternative media.  Americans are hungry for the truth, and they know that the amount of truth that they get from the mainstream media continues to decline.</p>
<p>The following are 12 things that the mainstream media is being strangely quiet about right now&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>#1</strong> The crisis at the Fort Calhoun nuclear facility in Nebraska has received almost no attention in the national mainstream media.</p>
<p>Back on June 7th, <a title="there was a fire" href="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/event-status/event/2011/20110608en.html#en46932" target="_blank">there was a fire</a> at Fort Calhoun.  The official story is that the fire was in an electrical switchgear room at the plant.  The facility lost power to a pump that cools the spent fuel pool for approximately 90 minutes.  According to the Omaha Public Power District, the fire was quickly extinguished and no radioactive material was released.</p>
<p>The following sequence of events is directly from <a title="the Omaha Public Power District website" href="http://www.oppd.com/AboutUs/22_007105" target="_blank">the Omaha Public Power District website</a>&#8230;.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was no such imminent danger with the Fort Calhoun Station spent-fuel pool.</li>
<li>Due to a fire in an electrical switchgear room at FCS on the morning of June 7, the plant temporarily lost power to a pump that cools the spent-fuel pool.</li>
<li>The fire-suppression system in that switchgear room operated as designed, extinguishing the fire quickly.</li>
<li>FCS plant operators switched the spent-fuel pool cooling system to an installed backup pump about 90 minutes after the loss of power.</li>
<li>During the interruption of cooling, temperature of the pool increased a few degrees, but the pool was never in danger of boiling.</li>
<li>Due to this situation, FCS declared an Alert at about 9:40 a.m. on June 7.</li>
<li>An alert is the second-least-serious of four emergency classifications established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</li>
<li>At about 1:15 p.m. on June 7, FCS operators declared they had taken all appropriate measures to safely return to the previously declared Notification of Unusual Event emergency classification. (See first item above.)</li>
</ul>
<p>But the crisis at Fort Calhoun is not over.  Right now, the nuclear facility at Fort Calhoun is essentially an island. It is surrounded by rising flood waters from the Missouri River.</p>
<p>Officials claim that there is no danger and that they are prepared for the river to rise another ten feet.</p>
<p>The Cooper Nuclear Station in Brownville, Nebraska is also being threatened by rising flood waters.  A &#8220;<a title="Notification of Unusual Event" href="http://www.ncnewspress.com/topstories/x1774073316/Cooper-Nuclear-Station-declares-Notification-of-Unusual-Event" target="_blank">Notification of Unusual Event</a>&#8221; was declared at Cooper Nuclear Station this morning at 4:02.  This notification was issued because the Missouri River&#8217;s water level reached 42.5 feet.</p>
<p>Right now the facility is operating normally and officials don&#8217;t expect a crisis.</p>
<p>But considering what has been going on at Fukushima, it would be nice if we could have gotten a lot more coverage of these events by the mainstream media.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> Most Americans are aware that the U.S. is involved in wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  However, the truth is that the U.S. military is also regularly bombing <a title="Yemen" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43333763/ns/world_news-the_new_york_times/" target="_blank">Yemen</a> and parts of <a title="Pakistan" href="http://www.japantoday.com/category/world/view/19-killed-in-2-u-s-drone-attacks-in-northwestern-pakistan" target="_blank">Pakistan</a>.  If you count the countries where the U.S. has special forces and/or covert operatives on the ground, the U.S. is probably &#8220;active&#8221; in more countries in the Middle East than it is not.  Now there are even persistent rumors that U.S. ground units <a title="are being prepared to go into Libya" href="http://www.infowars.com/u-s-invasion-of-libya-set-for-october/" target="_blank">are being prepared to go into Libya</a>.  Are we watching the early stages of World War 3 unfold before our eyes in slow motion?</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> The crisis at Fukushima continues to get worse.  Arnold Gundersen, a former nuclear industry senior vice president, <a title="recently made the following statement" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/06/201161664828302638.html" target="_blank">recently made the following statement</a> about the Fukushima disaster&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Fukushima is the biggest industrial catastrophe in the history of mankind&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>TEPCO has finally admitted that this disaster has released more radioactive material into the environment <a title="than Chernobyl did" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/06/201161664828302638.html" target="_blank">than Chernobyl did</a>.  That makes Fukushima the worst nuclear disaster of all time, and it is far from over.</p>
<p>Massive amounts of water is being poured into the spent fuel pools in order to keep them cool.  This is creating &#8220;<a title="hundreds of thousands of tons of highly radioactive sea water" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/06/201161664828302638.html" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands of tons of highly radioactive sea water</a>&#8221; that has got to go somewhere.  Inevitably much of it will get into the ground and into the sea.</p>
<p>Arnold Gundersen says that the scope of this problem <a title="is almost unimaginable" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/06/201161664828302638.html" target="_blank">is almost unimaginable</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;TEPCO announced they had a melt through. A melt down is when the fuel collapses to the bottom of the reactor, and a melt through means it has melted through some layers. That blob is incredibly radioactive, and now you have water on top of it. The water picks up enormous amounts of radiation, so you add more water and you are generating hundreds of thousands of tons of highly radioactive water.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The mainstream media is not paying as much attention to Fukushima these days, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that it is not a major league nightmare.</p>
<p>Elevated levels of radiation are being reported by Japanese bloggers <a title="all over eastern Japan" href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/elevated-radiation-levels-widespread-in-eastern-japan/7160" target="_blank">all over eastern Japan</a>.  There are reports of sick children all over the region.  One adviser to the government of Japan says that an area approximately 17 times the size of Manhattan <a title="is probably going to be uninhabitable" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/06/201161664828302638.html" target="_blank">is probably going to be uninhabitable</a>.</p>
<p>Of course the mainstream media has been telling us all along that Fukushima is nothing to be too concerned about and that authorities in Japan have everything under control.</p>
<p>If the mainstream media is not going to tell us the truth, how are they going to continue to have credibility?</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> Members of Congress continue to mention Christians as a threat to national security.  For example, <a title="during a recent Congressional hearing" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBAmPxSI8bo&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">during a recent Congressional hearing</a> U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee warned that &#8220;Christian militants&#8221; might try to &#8220;bring down the country&#8221; and that such groups need to be investigated.</p>
<p><strong>#5</strong> China&#8217;s eastern province of Zhejiang has experienced that worst flooding that it has seen <a title="in 55 years" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43454430/ns/weather/" target="_blank">in 55 years</a>.  2 million people have already been forced to leave their homes.  China has already been having huge problems with their crops over the past few years and this is only going to make things worse.</p>
<p><strong>#6</strong> Thanks to the Dodd-Frank Act, over the counter trading of gold and silver <a title="is going to be illegal" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/trading-over-counter-gold-and-silver-be-illegal-beginning-july-15?page=1" target="_blank">is going to be illegal</a> starting on July 15th.  Or at least that is what some companies apparently now believe.  The following is an excerpt from an email that Forex.com recently sent out to their customers&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Important Account Notice Re: Metals Trading</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We wanted to make you aware of some upcoming changes to FOREX.com’s product offering. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act enacted by US Congress, a new regulation prohibiting US residents from trading over the counter precious metals, including gold and silver, will go into effect on Friday, July 15, 2011.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>In conjunction with this new regulation, FOREX.com must discontinue metals trading for US residents on Friday, July 15, 2011 at the close of trading at 5pm ET. As a result, all open metals positions must be closed by July 15, 2011 at 5pm ET.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We encourage you to wind down your trading activity in these products over the next month in anticipation of the new rule, as any open XAU or XAG positions that remain open prior to July 15, 2011 at approximately 5:00 pm ET will be automatically liquidated.</em></p>
<p><em>We sincerely regret any inconvenience complying with the new U.S. regulation may cause you. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact our customer service team.</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely,<br />
The Team at FOREX.com</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Apparently, Section 742(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits anyone &#8220;from entering into, or offering to enter into, a transaction in any commodity with a person that is not an eligible contract participant or an eligible commercial entity, on a leveraged or margined basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what impact is this going to have on the gold and silver markets?</p>
<p>Nobody is quite sure yet.</p>
<p><strong>#7</strong> All over the world, huge cracks are appearing for no discernible reason.  For example, a massive crack <a title="that is approximately 3 kilometers long" href="http://thewatchers.adorraeli.com/2011/03/07/scientists-are-sounding-the-alarm-the-mysterious-cracks-appear-across-the-planet/" target="_blank">that is approximately 3 kilometers long</a> recent appeared in southern Peru.  Also, a 500 foot long crack suddenly appeared recently <a title="in the state of Michigan" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtTmnXt1TUQ&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">in the state of Michigan</a>.  When you also throw in all of the <a title="gigantic sinkholes" href="http://thisistheendoftheworldasweknowit.com/archives/sinkholes-2010" target="_blank">gigantic sinkholes</a> that have been opening all over the world, it is easy to conclude that the planet is becoming very unstable.</p>
<p><strong>#8</strong> According to U.S. Forest Service officials, the largest wildfire in Arizona state history has now covered <a title="more than 500,000 acres" href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/06/18/20110618wallow-fire-update.html" target="_blank">more than 500,000 acres</a>.  But based on the coverage it is being given by the mainstream media you would think that it is a non-event.</p>
<p><strong>#9</strong> There are reports that North Korea has tested a &#8220;<a title="super EMP weapon" href="http://www.newsmax.com/KenTimmerman/super-emp-emp-northkorea-nuke/2011/06/16/id/400260" target="_blank">super EMP weapon</a>&#8221; which would be capable of taking out most of the U.S. power grid in a single shot.  The North Koreans are apparently about to conduct another nuclear test and that has some Obama administration officials very concerned.</p>
<p><strong>#10</strong> All over the United States, &#8220;<a title="active shooter drills" href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2011/06/you-can-no-longer-think-of-yourselves.html" target="_blank">active shooter drills</a>&#8221; are being conducted in our public schools.  Often, most of the students are not told that these drills are fake.  Instead, students often go through hours of terror as they think a hostage situation or a shooting spree is really taking place.</p>
<p><strong>#11</strong> NASA has just launched a &#8220;major&#8221; preparedness initiative for all NASA personnel.  The following is an excerpt about this plan <a title="from NASA's own website" href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/hq/emergency/personalPreparedness/index.html" target="_blank">from NASA&#8217;s own website</a>&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A major initiative has been placed on Family/Personal Preparedness for all NASA personnel. The NASA Family/Personal Preparedness Program is designed to provide awareness, resources, and tools to the NASA Family (civil servants and contractors) to prepare for an emergency situation. The most important assets in the successful completion of NASA’s mission are our employees’ and their families. We are taking the steps to prepare our workforce, but it is your personal obligation to prepare yourself and your families for emergencies.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>#12</strong> Over the past week <a title="over 40 temporary &quot;no fly zones&quot;" href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html" target="_blank">over 40 temporary &#8220;no fly zones&#8221;</a> have been declared by the FAA.  This is very highly unusual.  Nobody seems to know exactly why this is happening.</p>
<p>So what do all of these things mean?</p>
<p>It would be nice if the mainstream media would examine some of these important issues more closely and do some honest reporting on them.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have an opinion on some of these issues.  Feel free to share what you think by leaving a comment below&#8230;.</p>

			<p><strong>Official suggests Japan could become ’uninhabitable&#8230;’</strong></p>
<p>By Ethan A. Huff | <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032657_Fukushima_meltdown.html">NaturalNews.com</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/15679japanmeltdown_inner.jpg" alt="" width="220" />Recent reports confirming that Reactors 1, 2, and 3 of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility completely melted just hours after the devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the area on March 11<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032537_Fukushima_meltdown.html" target="_blank">(http://www.naturalnews.com/032537_F&#8230;)</a> have been trumped by even worse news that those same reactors have all likely &#8220;melted through,&#8221; a situation that according to Japan’s Daily Yomiuri DY is &#8220;the worst possibility in a nuclear accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>And senior political official Ichiro Ozawa suggested in an interview with<em>The Wall Street Journal </em>(WSJ) that the<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/Fukushima.html">Fukushima</a>situation could make the entire country of<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/Japan.html">Japan</a>&#8220;unlivable.&#8221;</p>
<p>A nuclear core<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/meltdown.html">meltdown</a>involves nuclear<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/fuel.html">fuel</a>exceeding its melting point to the point where it damages the core, leaks out, and threatens to potentially release high levels of radiation into the<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/environment.html">environment</a>. However, a nuclear melt-through is an even worse scenario, as<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/nuclear.html">nuclear</a>fuel literally melts through the bottom of damaged reactor pressure vessels into out containment vessels &#8212; and possibly even melts through those outer vessels directly into ground, air, and<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/water.html">water</a>.</p>
<p>The report suggesting that melt-throughs have already occurred, which is set to be submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is the &#8220;first official recognition&#8221; of this dire situation, according to DY. It also confirms early suspicions that such a scenario had been underway all along, as later reports confirmed that the epic disaster at the reactors had produced holes in come of the plant&#8217;s core containment vessels, and that radioactive water, and possibly even fuel, were leaking into the lower vessels.</p>
<p>IAEA has already stated that the Fukushima disaster is at least as bad as the<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/Chernobyl.html">Chernobyl</a>disaster (<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2011/04/what-does-fukushima-bad-chernobyl-actually-mean/36575/" target="_blank">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/glob&#8230;</a>), but this new information now suggests that it is probably even worse. At this time, it is unknown whether the fuel that has accumulated in the outer containment vessels has seeped outside, where it has the potential to contaminate<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/groundwater.html">groundwater</a>supplies and wreak widespread environmental damage.</p>
<p>In an interview conducted prior to the release of the new report, Ichiro Ozawa told the WSJ that areas around Fukushima were already becoming completely &#8220;uninhabitable.&#8221; He also suggested that as it currently stands, much of the rest of the country, including Tokyo, could suffer the same fate if nothing is done to properly and effectively contain the situation.</p>

			<p><strong>A Book Review in Light of Current Events&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/apocnever2.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/apocnever2.jpg" alt="APOCALYSE NEVER" /></a>&#8220;<em>Every man, woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment by accident, or miscalculation, or by madness. The weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us.</em>&#8221; -John F. Kennedy  September 25, 1961</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>APOCALYSE NEVER: Forging the Path to a Nuclear Weapon-Free World</em>&#8221; by Dr. Tad Daley, not only envisions but offers us the ways to seize JFK’s dream; and the fierce urgency of current events could be our final call for action to abolish all things nuclear:&gt;</p>
<p>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, who has been held at Guantanamo since 2006, told interrogators that al-Qaeda will detonate a nuclear device if Osama bin Laden were captured or killed, according to classified files released by the WikiLeaks website. [1]</p>
<p>Ten days after the earthquake in Japan triggered the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, extended the license of a virtual twin of Fukushima; a 40-year-old Vermont nuclear reactor for another two decades. The license renewal was granted even though the reactor&#8217;s cooling tower had literally fallen down, and the plant had repeatedly leaked radioactive fluid. [2]</p>

</div>
<p>Dr. Daley does not offer us a Utopian fantasy, but a concrete call to political action because, &#8220;No government, not even the most democratic, can force us to live under this threat. No state in the world can offer any kind of security against this menace of a nuclear holocaust, or guarantee to prevent it. This is why the citizens must confront their government and warn it that it has no right to expose them to this danger. Because, in effect, the citizens are being held hostage by their own government, just as if they have been hijacked and deprived of their freedom and threatened. When governments develop nuclear weapons they are violating the basic rights of their citizens, the basic right not to live under constant threat of annihilation.&#8221; -Mordechai Vanunu, 1987 from Ashkelon Prison.</p>
<p>In his 2012 budget, President Obama included $54 billion in federal loan guarantees for new nuclear reactors and $7.6 billion for nuclear weapons research and production, but &#8220;Any nation that year after year continues to raise the Defense budget while cutting social programs to the neediest is a nation approaching spiritual death.&#8221; - Rev. MLK</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons are not just morally indefensible but politically unsustainable.</p>
<p>America is one of the five nuclear powers that signed the NPT and thus is obligated to abolish its nuclear weapons-but the USA has been in violation ever since the day America signed the NPT!</p>
<p>The NPT/Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, was created in 1968, and maintains that nuclear weapons proliferation can only be curtailed if nuclear countries move toward disarmament and the five nuclear powers that signed the NPT must abolish their nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In 1966, at the height of the Cold War, the US nuclear arsenal was estimated at over 32,000 warheads. Current estimates range between 5,000 to 12,000; but even one is more than enough to destroy Creation as we now know it.</p>
<p>IF that day we call 9/11 taught us anything, it should be that America&#8217;s nuclear arsenal cannot defeat &#8216;terrorism&#8217; or provide security from the actions of a few violent mad men who target and murder innocent people.</p>
<p>American money is imprinted with &#8220;IN GOD WE TRUST&#8221; but yet the U.S. maintains a nuclear arsenal of nearly 2,000 on hair-trigger alert ever since the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The Orwellian named Life Extension Program will extend the life of every one of America’s weapons of mass destruction for three decades or more as well as undermine sound national security by introducing major changes to existing nuclear weapons stockpile that had been extensively tested.</p>
<p>On 8 July 1996, the International Court of Justice issued the statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;The destructive power of nuclear weapons cannot be contained in either space or time. They have the potential to destroy all civilization and the entire ecosystem of the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ICJ also affirmed the &#8220;fundamental, cardinal and intransgressible&#8221; rule that &#8220;States must never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons that are incapable of distinguishing between civilians and military targets.&#8221;</p>
<p>States have obligations.  People have rights.</p>
<p>Anti-nuclear civil resistance is the right of every citizen of the world, for the nuclear threat attacks every core concept of human rights and &#8220;calls for urgent and universal action for its prevention. If it is a basic human right to be free of threat or violence, if the right to life is a basic human right, if the protection of children and future generations is a basic human duty, international law must unhesitatingly recognize that the right to non violent resistance activities for the prevention of such an international crime is basic to human dignity.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p>The greatest enemy of humanity may well be all things Nuclear and &#8220;We have seen the enemy and he is US.&#8221;-Pogo</p>
<p>In &#8220;APOCALYSE NEVER&#8221;, Tad Daley nails America&#8217;s hypocrisy and illuminates the status quo of Nuclear Apartheid: &#8220;For decades, the United States has said to other countries, &#8216;We can have them, but you can’t.&#8217;&#8221; [4]</p>
<p>One State that the American Government colludes with in its nuclear deceptions is a non-signatory of the NPT: Israel:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bslmk5jipGA" target="_blank">US and Israeli Nuclear Deceptions</a></strong></p>
<p>Dr. Avner Cohen, is an Israeli-born philosopher, historical researcher and a leading expert in Israel&#8217;s nuclear policy of deception, which is spun as &#8216;Ambiguity.&#8217;</p>
<p>Cohen’s latest release is &#8220;The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel&#8217;s Bargain with the Bomb&#8221; and in a recent interview with Haaretz, Cohen spoke about a late-1969 meeting between Golda Meir and Nixon:</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States and most of the Western world agreed to accept Israel&#8217;s special nuclear status. In other words, Israel did not join the Non-Proliferation Treaty, but it received special status, and pressure was not exerted on it with regard to this topic. Ambiguity is the Israeli-American policy. Without the West&#8217;s agreement, there would be no ambiguity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bitter irony is that right now, ambiguity serves the interests of Israel&#8217;s rival in the Middle East. Iran is creating its own version of ambiguity: not the concealment of its project, but rather ambiguity with regard to the distinction separating possession and non-possession of nuclear weapons. It reiterates that it has no intention of building a bomb, but that it has the right to enrich uranium, and even come close to developing [nuclear] weapons &#8211; while still remaining true to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is straddling the line, and in my opinion, Iran wants to, and can, remain for some time with the status of a state that might or might not have the bomb. Iran is a state of ambiguity.&#8221; [5]</p>
<p>On 2 October 2009, The Washington Times reported that Obama agreed to keep Israel&#8217;s nukes &#8216;secret&#8217; and reaffirmed a 4-decade-old understanding that has allowed Israel to keep a nuclear arsenal without opening it to international inspections.&#8221; [6]</p>
<p>Three officials spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were discussing private conversations, but all said Obama pledged to maintain the agreement when he first hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in May 2009.</p>
<p>Under the understanding, the U.S. has not pressured Israel to disclose its nuclear weapons or to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would require Israel to give up its estimated several hundred nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>This nuclear deception was reached at a summit between President Nixon and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir on 25 September 1969.</p>
<p>Avner Cohen, reported that the accord amounted to &#8220;the United States passively accepting Israel&#8217;s nuclear weapons status as long as Israel does not unveil publicly its capability or test a weapon.&#8221;[Ibid]</p>
<p>During my 2005 interviews with Mordechai Vanunu he told me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know that President Kennedy tried to stop Israel from building atomic weapons? In 1963, he forced Prime Minister Ben Guirion to admit the Dimona was not a textile plant, as the sign outside proclaimed, but a nuclear plant. The Prime Minister said, &#8216;The nuclear reactor is only for peace.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kennedy insisted on an open internal inspection. He wrote letters demanding that Ben Guirion open up the Dimona for inspection. The French were responsible for the actual building of the Dimona. The Germans gave the money; they were feeling guilty for the Holocaust, and tried to pay their way out. Everything inside was written in French, when I was there, almost twenty years ago. Back then, the Dimona descended seven floors underground.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1955, Perez and Guirion met with the French to agree they would get a nuclear reactor if they fought against Egypt to control the Sinai and Suez Canal. That was the war of 1956. Eisenhower demanded that Israel leave the Sinai, but the reactor plant deal continued on.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Johnson became president, he made an agreement with Israel that two senators would come every year to inspect. Before the senators would visit, the Israelis would build a wall to block the underground elevators and stairways. From 1963 to ’69, the senators came, but they never knew about the wall that hid the rest of the Dimona from them. Nixon stopped the inspections and agreed to ignore the situation. As a result, Israel increased production. In 1986, there were over two hundred bombs. Today, they may have enough plutonium for ten bombs a year.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p>In 2007, the Nixon library declassified a 19 July 1969, memo from Henry Kissinger, the then national security adviser stating: &#8220;While we might ideally like to halt actual Israeli possession, what we really want at a minimum may be just to keep Israeli possession from becoming an established international fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;established international facts&#8221; were exposed in 1986, when Mordechai Vanunu told the truth and provided the photographic proof of Israel&#8217;s seven story underground WMD Facility that can be viewed on You Tube:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbjgDERSuiI" target="_blank">Israel&#8217;s Dimona Nuclear Weapons Factory In 3D</a></strong></p>
<p>Another established international fact occurred on 17 April 2010, when Iran hosted a conference in Tehran on nuclear disarmament with sixty countries represented.</p>
<p>Iran&#8217;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a statement delivered at the conference stating that nuclear weaponry was &#8220;haram&#8221; meaning prohibited under Islam and he also blew the doors off Israel&#8217;s and America&#8217;s nuclear deceptions:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If America’s claims of fighting the proliferation of nuclear weapons were not false, would the Zionist regime be able to turn the occupied Palestinian lands into an arsenal where a huge number of nuclear weapons are stored while refusing to respect international regulations in this regard, especially the NPT?</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;There is only one government that has committed a nuclear crime so far. Only the government of the United States of America has attacked the oppressed people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs in an unfair and inhumane war…using or even threatening to use such weapons is a serious violation of the most basic rules of philanthropy and is a clear manifestation of war crimes.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The greatest violators of the NPT are the powers who have reneged on their obligation to dispose of nuclear weapons mentioned in Article 6 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. These powers have even surpassed other countries with respect to promoting nuclear weapons in the world. By providing the Zionist regime with nuclear weapons and supporting its policies, these powers play a direct role in promoting nuclear weapons which is against the obligations they have undertaken according to Article 1 of the NPT.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;We believe that besides nuclear weapons, other types of weapons of mass destruction such as chemical and biological weapons also pose a serious threat to humanity. The Iranian nation, which is itself a victim of chemical weapons, feels more than any other nation the danger that is caused by the production and stockpiling of such weapons and is prepared to make use of all its facilities to counter such threats. We consider the use of such weapons as haram (religiously forbidden) and believe that it is everyone’s duty to make efforts to secure humanity against this great disaster.&#8221;</em>[8] <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2010/04/khamenei-us-only-nuclear-criminal-for-hiroshima.html" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>On 5 April 2009, President Obama stood on the world stage in Prague and admitted, &#8220;As the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. When we fail to pursue peace, then it stays forever beyond our grasp. We know the path when we choose fear over hope. To denounce or shrug off a call for cooperation is an easy but also cowardly thing to do. That’s how wars begin. That’s where human progress ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;The voices of peace and progress must be raised together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human destiny will be what we make of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Words must mean something.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1987, from Ashkelon prison, Mordechai Vanunu wrote words that still mean something:</p>
<p>&#8220;The passive acceptance and complacency with regard to the existence of nuclear weapons anywhere on earth is the disease of society today.</p>
<p>&#8220;This struggle is not only a legitimate one &#8211; it is a moral, inescapable struggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Already now there are enough nuclear missiles to destroy the world many times over [and] this issue should unite us all, because that is our real enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is any government qualified and authorized to produce such weapons?&#8221; [9]</p>
<p>Tad Daley has responded with a resounding NO and he concludes &#8220;APOCALYSE NEVER: Forging the Path to a Nuclear Weapon-Free World&#8221; reminding us that the atomic sword that hangs so precariously over Humanity’s head must be cut and it is up to everyone of us &#8220;to turn every single nuclear sword, everywhere on earth, into the plowshares of peace that the prophet Isaiah envisioned for us so many long centuries ago. The matter is in our hands. The sword is in our grasp. We need only to reach out, and seize it. Apocalypse never.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4766003550_d2d40020f1_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" />Three time Nobel Peace Prize Nominee, Kathy Kelly, on 3 July 2010 in front of The Banner made from the cloth cut from the clothes ofPLOWSHARES 8, Father Philip Francis Berrigan as he lay dying in his bed. Father Berrigan also noted that, &#8220;If enough Christians followed the gospel, they could bring any state to its knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>During my 2005 interviews with Vanunu I asked him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever considered the idea that the anti-Christ may not be a man at all? I keep thinking how nuclear weapons are promoted by governments as instruments of peace, but they only bring destruction. I can’t imagine that God intended for man to blow up this planet, but instead, to learn how to share it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vanunu replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way to peace is peace; the only way is nonviolence. The only answer to Israeli nuclear weapons, their aggression, occupation and oppression, and the wall and refugee camps is to answer them with truth and a peaceful voice. When I became the spy for the world, I did it all for the people of the world. If governments do not report the truth, and if the media does not report the truth, then all we can do is follow our consciences. Daniel Ellsberg did, the woman from Enron did, and I did.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Lacanja-burn3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Lacanja-burn2.jpg" alt="Lacanja burn" /></a>At present, numerous environmental researchers are warning of future resource shortages. The list of them is large and includes water, oil, a variety of minerals and metals, as well as other materials.</p>
<p>Yet, most people carry on as if they do not hear the message at all. They refuse to cut back in their dreams of continuing economic growth.</p>
<p>In relation, part of the problem with them is perhaps an inability to make connections. For the most part, they seem to have little or no idea about the collective consequences of their individual behaviors.</p>
<p>For example, they can&#8217;t walk into a super-sized Wal Mart or a mall and see the environmental destruction and energy use behind each type of product on the shelves, nor that the whole gargantuan conglomeration of products could cause a problem. They can&#8217;t look at cotton goods or food and imagine the huge oceanic dead zones and the annihilation of many diverse organisms caused by farm runoff. They can&#8217;t go to the paper isle and picture that, aside from all of the multitudes of items derived from timber, U.S. toilet paper use alone destroys thirteen million acres of forests per year, along with all life dependent on those forests.</p>
<p>Particularly the loggers, the paper mill operators, the truckers hauling raw materials and final products, and the store clerks don&#8217;t want to visualize such images. They don&#8217;t want to see their own roles in the process any more than do the people who, while complaining about the impacts of overpopulation on crowded highways, chose to have many children, which, of course, will lead to many more toilet paper purchases in times to come. In fact, they, like the individuals who wring their hands over mountaintop blowups for coal and the slaughter of indigenous forest dwellers by oil company hired thugs, don&#8217;t want to be told of cut-backs of any types at all, let alone just bathroom paper.</p>
<p>Especially if they are fond of vacation travel or have seen their home energy use spike due to lots of appliances running at once, they don&#8217;t want to picture that they possibly could be implicated in anything having to do with the downside of their lifestyles. They don&#8217;t want to link their habits to the fact that over seventy percent of electricity in the U.S. comes from fossil fuels. They don&#8217;t want to think that maybe their rising demand for oil at the pump or penchant for air travel is somehow indirectly related to the types of damage seen in the Amazon forests, the Appalachians, the Niger Delta or the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Above all, they do not want to be told that the economic growth is not coming back. They don&#8217;t want to picture that life will dramatically change as the oil runs out while the price for it and everything dependent on it will continuously rise. They don&#8217;t want to question about whether the capitalist system of economics will cause further ecological ruin and social inequality as it plays itself out.</p>
<p>Further, they don&#8217;t want to consider that maybe they will be forced to change some of their life&#8217;s major goals and the ways that they live in times to come due to a combination of factors, such as the coming energy power-down, climate change variables, diminishing resource bases and overpopulation. No, they, instead, want to rise up the socio-economic chain so as to be able to consume even more goods and, if they&#8217;re particularly adept at obtaining riches, maybe even be able to purchase a vacation home, a yacht, an RV or some other coveted treasure.</p>
<p>Moreover, they don&#8217;t want to imagine that maybe two groups will make out okay in times ahead and one of them probably won&#8217;t be the (ever shrinking) middle class. They don&#8217;t want to note that the successful ones just could be the very wealthy people, who can afford to buy anything regardless of its costliness and scarcity, and the people at the other end of the spectrum, who have simply walked away from the status quo to form self-sufficient farming communities, transition towns and egalitarian co-ops able to provide for the majority of their members&#8217; needs.</p>
<p>Instead, they simply want to envision that everything will get better overall in life after a spell. Yet, here we are all together stuck in a situation in which there exist seven billion humans all needing food, water, shelter and other things while increasing in number at a rate unprecedented in human history. All together, we&#8217;re digging up and plowing every parcel of land on which we can manage to lay our hands. We&#8217;re trawling and dredging every ocean and sea onto which we can stake our claims. We&#8217;re damming every waterway that can be controlled. We&#8217;re pumping and polluting the world&#8217;s fresh water supply faster than it can be replenished, using up other resources in entirety, turning the Earth&#8217;s oceans into acid, fouling the atmosphere, scarring the land with deep mining holes, blowing up mountains to extract their coal and, in exchange, creating mountains of trash.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, we&#8217;re methodically ripping apart the planet&#8217;s forests at the rate of about one acre per second, destroying multitudinous species one after another, creating climate change on a scale that staggers the imagination, and generating explosions of radiation to blow into every outdoors nook and cranny in existence. (Recent news headlines include Radiation Readings in Fukushima Reactor Rise to Highest Since Crisis Began. Imagine the hubris of a species that refuses to learn from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, such that even now the desire exists to build even more nuclear plants and A-bombs!) </p>
<p>At the same time, we&#8217;re warring with each other over resources between and within nations, and always, always  &#8230; insisting upon more things to own. In relation, the proliferation of wants and needs is limitless.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re demanding more food, more water, more construction for our ever burgeoning masses, more jobs and, especially, more spaces into which to fan out as we add 219,000 more humans every single day (eighty million people each year) while simultaneously displacing other types of life whose environments we take over in the process. Meanwhile, billions are sunk in poverty largely due to having already exceeded their regions&#8217; carrying capacity and, as they did so, they often took the last trees with them, just as had happened on Easter Island.</p>
<p>At some point, something has to give. The pattern, the rapacious ravage, cannot persist indefinitely. Indeed, it won&#8217;t do so because the resource base, itself, is largely disappearing across the globe. The ocean fisheries are depleting and expected to run out by mid-century. Climate change has brought pine and spruce beetles in such high numbers that they are eating millions upon millions of acres of trees and spreading out everywhere that they can, much like their human counterparts. </p>
<p>Concurrently, methane is releasing from underwater beds and permafrost to join the carbon releases from humanity&#8217;s use of fossil fuel from rich underground deposits that took millions of years to form, and that will be gone in the blink of a century&#8217;s time. In relation, the looming climate change effects will be horrendous and will curtail many areas of human activities.</p>
<p>Yet, the main reason that the whole mess will be curbed is a simple one: Infinite growth, whether economic growth or population growth, cannot continue indefinitely. As the economist Kenneth Ewart Boulding reputedly said, &#8220;Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accordingly, one can envision that a crash is coming &#8212; one far worse than the current recession. In large measure, it&#8217;s because environmental tipping points are on the way and, for those people in the worst locations for the collapse &#8212; the desperation, conflicts and chaos will likely be horrific in scale and ferocity.</p>
<p>How could they not be when our governments and the status quo do not encourage our transitioning to a steady state economy, business based on regionalized commerce and a cooperative inclusive economic arrangement rather than out of control global competition? How can further troubles not come into being when a vicious globalized capitalist system is in existence for which maximal profits, not people and their needs, is always the overriding goal? Despite its desirably from many standpoints, how can an alternative scheme be put in place when it bumps up against the prevailing paradigm and the corporatists &#8212; the powerful über-elites that control the gargantuan transnational companies and our fawning government toadies?</p>
<p>All considered, the best course of action, unless one is incredibly affluent, is to run for the hills &#8212; almost quite literally so. Under the circumstance, it could be sensible to find a quiet niche somewhere in which there&#8217;s already a community in place whose members have the appropriate skills sets, constructive understandings and a supportive intact surrounding environment so as to be able to create a largely self-reliant way of life. Even though such a change could be hard, the option of doing nothing different could become increasingly problematic in light of the further social and ecological breakdown that&#8217;s assuredly on the way.</p>
