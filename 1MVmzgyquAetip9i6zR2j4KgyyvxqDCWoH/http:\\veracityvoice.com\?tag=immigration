<p>“In the past three days alone, Texas Gov. Rick Perry used a Washington Post op-ed to warn about the dangers of ‘isolationism’ and describe Paul as ‘curiously blind’ to growing threats in Iraq. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) accused the Kentucky senator on CNN of wanting a ‘withdrawal to fortress America.’ And former Vice President Dick Cheney declared at a POLITICO Playbook luncheon on Monday that ‘isolationism is crazy,’ while his daughter, Liz Cheney, said Paul ‘leaves something to be desired, in terms of national security policy.’</p>
<p>“The preemptive strikes suggest that many in GOP fear Paul is winning the foreign policy argument with the American people&#8211;and that that could make him a formidable candidate in 2016. After all, second-tier presidential hopefuls don’t usually get shouted down this way.</p>
<p>“‘I think the general fear on the part of a lot of leaders in the Republican Party is that there’s an isolationist temptation after two big wars, an isolationist temptation in the American electorate,’ said Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who was a deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration. ‘And I think people are genuinely concerned about it and desirous of trying to stop it before it spreads further.’”</p>
<p>See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fstory%2F2014%2F07%2Frand-paul-foreign-policy-108897.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQDZf_ruabLT387cPbCtAi9eiKAg" target="_blank">The Rand Paul Pile On</a></p>
<p>Abrams said the GOP establishment is “genuinely concerned” about a Rand Paul presidency. Baloney! They are pee-in-their-pants, scared-out-of-their-minds about it. The GOP establishment is far more concerned over someone like Rand Paul obtaining the White House than they are a Democrat obtaining the White House. In truth, when it comes to globalism, there really isn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the Democrat and Republican parties in Washington, D.C. The movers and shakers of both parties are globalist to the core.</p>
<p>It is more than interesting that the Politico report quoted above sought the opinion of CFR member Elliot Abrams. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is an elitist cabal of globalists that has dominated the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans for much of the Twentieth (and now Twenty-First) Century.</p>
<p>At this point it is important to remind readers of what Rear Admiral Chester Ward&#8211;himself a CFR member until he realized what it was all about and withdrew&#8211;said about the CFR. Remember, Admiral Ward was the Judge Advocate General of the Navy from 1956-1960.</p>
<p>Admiral Ward said, “The most powerful clique in these elitist groups [such as the CFR, Trilateral Commission, et al] have one objective in common&#8211;they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and the national independence of the United States. A second clique of international members in the CFR . . . comprises the Wall Street international bankers and their key agents. Primarily, they want the world banking monopoly from whatever power ends up in the control of global government.”</p>
<p>He also said, “The main purpose of the Council on Foreign Relations is promoting the disarmament of U.S. sovereignty and national independence and submergence into an all-powerful, one world government.”</p>
<p>Admiral Ward was exactly right. Even a cursory look at the names of the most prominent politicians, media personalities, and leaders of the Federal Reserve shows a preponderance of influence by the CFR. For example, here is a small listing of some of the most influential members of the CFR or Trilateral Commission (or sometimes both):</p>
<p>George Herbert Walker Bush. Bill Clinton. Sandra Day O’Connor. Dick Cheney. Les Aspin. Colin Powell. Robert Gates. Brent Scowcroft. Jesse Jackson, Sr. Mario Cuomo. Dan Rather. Tom Brokaw. David Brinkley. John Chancellor. Marvin Kalb. Diane Sawyer. Barbara Walters. Cyrus Vance. Paul Volcker. Henry Kissinger. George Schultz. Alan Greenspan. Madeleine Albright. Roger Altman. Bruce Babbitt. Howard Baker. Samuel Berger. Elaine Chao. Dianne Feinstein. Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Chuck Hagel. Gary Hart. John McCain. George Mitchell. Bill Moyers. Jay Rockefeller. Donna Shalala. Strobe Talbott. Fred Thompson. Robert Zoellick. Richard Nixon. Hubert H. Humphrey. George McGovern. Gerald Ford. Jimmy Carter. John Anderson. Walter Mondale. Michael Dukakis. Al Gore. John Kerry.</p>
<p>What readers should immediately notice about this list is the fact that it is filled with both Democrats and Republicans. Can one imagine the outrage if the above names were all members of the Christian Coalition or even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)? But the fact that so many of America’s leaders from both major parties all share membership in the CFR seems to go completely unnoticed.</p>
<p>What we have in Washington, D.C., is CFR-dominated party D and CFR-dominated party R. No wonder there hasn’t been any significant change in America’s foreign policy since World War II, no matter which major party controlled the White House and Congress.</p>
<p>The globalists within the two major parties will do anything to make sure that a non-globalist is not elected President of the United States or given a too-powerful position of congressional leadership. Hence, the GOP establishment is pouncing on Rand Paul early to try and kill any momentum he might garner going into the 2016 presidential race. Virtually everything the global elite plan to do hinge on America engaging in perpetual war. Perpetual war is the linchpin that holds the entire globalist agenda intact. Anyone who threatens that linchpin is declared an enemy by the establishment and is slated for political destruction.</p>
<p>Perpetual war allows the internationalists to continue to fund dirty black-ops drug smuggling, corrupt banking practices, political briberies, political assassinations, etc. Perpetual war is also the number one excuse for creating a universal surveillance society within the United States. Perpetual war justifies spying on the American citizenry, militarizing local and State police agencies, passing legislation that allows the federal government to declare any American citizen an “enemy combatant” or seize and incarcerate indefinitely any U.S. citizen without warrant or Habeas Corpus, and send drones into America’s heartland.</p>
<p>And when it comes to perpetual war and building a Police State at home, the neocons within the Republican Party are far more dangerous than Democrats. Far more! With support for abortion-on-demand, homosexual marriages, the secularization of America’s schools and public institutions, globalists use liberal Democrats to dismantle America’s Christian traditions and value systems. But when it comes to building both the Warfare State and the Police State, globalists primarily use “conservative” Republicans. And, of course, when it comes to obliterating America’s traditional culture by swamping the country with illegal immigrants, both Republicans and Democrats are employed. That’s why you will find as many Republicans (including those at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) as Democrats pushing amnesty for illegals. There is absolutely no doubt that had not Tea-Party Republicans recently defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (a major proponent of amnesty) in the Virginia primaries, the GOP-led House would have joined with Barack Obama and Senate Democrats to pass amnesty for illegals this summer. That is absolutely undeniable. We owe Virginia Republicans a huge “Thank You!” (I will write more about the illegal immigration problem in an upcoming column.)</p>
<p>There is no question that right now the battle for the heart and soul (not to mention the future) of America is the burgeoning police state complete with its twin-sister perpetual war. And, yes, illegal immigration is also a major battlefield right now. If the globalist attempt to turn the United States into a Police State&#8211;and again ramp up more wars of intervention&#8211;is not stopped in the next few short years, it will mean the death of freedom and independence in America forever. And neocon Republicans are the primary culprits in this regard.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I don’t know how to say it any plainer: if you are forced to choose between a pro-war, pro-police state, neocon Republican candidate for federal office and a Democrat, and if you believe in voting for the “lesser-of-two-evils,” the Democrat is the one for whom you must vote.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is exactly the choice that the citizens of Montana have this year in its lone U.S. House race. We have a Democrat, John Lewis, running against a pro-war, pro-police state, neocon Republican Ryan Zinke. Without a doubt, the Democrat John Lewis is by far the lesser evil than Ryan Zinke.</p>
<p>Ryan Zinke never met a war he doesn’t like. He is already on public record saying “civilians” should not be allowed to possess .50 caliber rifles. (Of course, now that he is a candidate for Congress, he has had a sudden election year conversion on the subject.) He has owning-interest in a drone manufacturing company. He is trying to use his credentials as a former Navy SEAL to propel him to the U.S. Congress; but Ryan Zinke is a warmongering, police state facilitator of the lowest order. Being the U.S. House seat in Montana is typically a Republican seat, it is very likely that if the Democrat Lewis wins, he would be a one-termer. A GOP candidate (someone besides Ryan Zinke, who was the absolute worst of all the candidates that the GOP had to offer this year) would have a very good chance of defeating the Democrat Lewis in 2016. On the other hand, if Zinke wins this November, we are probably going to be stuck with this neocon indefinitely. This would be a monstrous mistake for Montana and the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, what the globalist elite at the CFR fear most is a presidential candidate who refuses to comply with the pro-war, pro-police state agenda. And while I am still not certain that Rand Paul has the same courage and convictions of his father, Ron Paul, he is, without a doubt, the closest ideologically to the Washington and Jeffersonian vision of non-entanglement in foreign affairs and the philosophical sacredness of individual liberty that we seem to have at the national level these days. As such, the GOP establishment is literally trying to skewer Senator Paul.</p>
<p>The GOP establishment is not worried about Texas Governor Rick Perry, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Mitt Romney, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, or Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan. None of these men would stand in the way of the globalist agenda. But the GOP establishment is terrified of Rand Paul&#8211;and to a lesser extent Texas Senator Ted Cruz. But given the way that Republican leaders are pouncing on Mr. Paul, it is obvious that he is the one they believe poses the greatest threat to the globalist agenda.</p>

</ul>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">The question is not what pacifism has achieved throughout history, but what has war achieved?</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Remark made to a pacifist: “If only everyone else would live in the way you recommend, I would gladly live that way as well – but not until everyone else does.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The Pacifist’s reply: “Why then, sir, you would be the last man on earth to do good. I would rather be one of the first.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, 1947, words long cherished by a large majority of the Japanese people:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">This statement is probably unique amongst the world’s constitutions.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But on July 1, 2014 the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, without changing a word of Article 9, announced a “reinterpretation” of it to allow for military action in conjunction with allies. This decision can be seen as the culmination of a decades-long effort by the United States to wean Japan away from its post-WW2 pacifist constitution and foreign policy and set it back on the righteous path of being a military power once again, only this time acting in coordination with US foreign policy needs.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In the triumphalism of the end of the Second World War, the American occupation of Japan, in the person of General Douglas MacArthur, played a major role in the creation of this constitution. But after the communists came to power in China in 1949, the United States opted for a strong Japan safely ensconced in the anti-communist camp. For pacifism, it’s been downhill ever since … step by step … MacArthur himself ordered the creation of a “national police reserve”, which became the embryo of the future Japanese military … visiting Tokyo in 1956, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told Japanese officials: “In the past, Japan had demonstrated her superiority over the Russians and over China. It was time for Japan to think again of being and acting like a Great Power.”  … various US-Japanese security and defense cooperation treaties, which called on Japan to integrate its military technology with that of the US and NATO … the US supplying new sophisticated military aircraft and destroyers … all manner of Japanese logistical assistance to the US in Washington’s frequent military operations in Asia … repeated US pressure on Japan to increase its military budget and the size of its armed forces … more than a hundred US military bases in Japan, protected by the Japanese military … US-Japanese joint military exercises and joint research on a missile defense system … the US Ambassador to Japan, 2001: “I think the reality of circumstances in the world is going to suggest to the Japanese that they reinterpret or redefine Article 9.”  … Under pressure from Washington, Japan sent several naval vessels to the Indian Ocean to refuel US and British warships as part of the Afghanistan campaign in 2002, then sent non-combat forces to Iraq to assist the American war as well as to East Timor, another made-in-America war scenario … US Secretary of State Colin Powell, 2004: “If Japan is going to play a full role on the world stage and become a full active participating member of the Security Council, and have the kind of obligations that it would pick up as a member of the Security Council, Article Nine would have to be examined in that light.”  …</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In 2012 Japan was induced to take part in a military exercise with 21 other countries, converging on Hawaii for the largest-ever Rim of the Pacific naval exercises and war games, with a Japanese admiral serving as vice commander of the combined task force.  And so it went … until, finally, on July 1 of this year, the Abe administration announced their historic decision. Abe, it should be noted, is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, with which the CIA has had a long and intimate connection, even when party leaders were convicted World War 2 war criminals.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">If and when the American empire engages in combat with China or Russia, it appears that Washington will be able to count on their Japanese brothers-in-arms. In the meantime, the many US bases in Japan serve as part of the encirclement of China, and during the Vietnam War the United States used their Japanese bases as launching pads to bomb Vietnam.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The US policies and propaganda not only got rid of the annoying Article 9, but along the way it gave rise to a Japanese version of McCarthyism. A prime example of this is the case of Kimiko Nezu, a 54-year-old Japanese teacher, who was punished by being transferred from school to school, by suspensions, salary cuts, and threats of dismissal because of her refusal to stand during the playing of the national anthem, a World War II song chosen as the anthem in 1999. She opposed the song because it was the same one sung as the Imperial Army set forth from Japan calling for an “eternal reign” of the emperor. At graduation ceremonies in 2004, 198 teachers refused to stand for the song. After a series of fines and disciplinary actions, Nezu and nine other teachers were the only protesters the following year. Nezu was then allowed to teach only when another teacher was present.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">Yankee Blowback</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">The number of children attempting to cross the Mexican border into the United States has risen dramatically in the last five years: In fiscal year 2009 (October 1, 2009 &#8211; September 30, 2010) about 6,000 unaccompanied minors were detained near the border. The US Department of Homeland Security estimates for the fiscal year 2014 the detention of as many as 74,000 unaccompanied minors. Approximately 28% of the children detained this year are from Honduras, 24% from Guatemala, and 21% from El Salvador. The particularly severe increases in Honduran migration are a direct result of the June 28, 2009 military coup that overthrew the democratically-elected president, Manuel Zelaya, after he did things like raising the minimum wage, giving subsidies to small farmers, and instituting free education. The coup – like so many others in Latin America – was led by a graduate of Washington’s infamous School of the Americas.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">As per the standard Western Hemisphere script, the Honduran coup was followed by the abusive policies of the new regime, loyally supported by the United States. The State Department was virtually alone in the Western Hemisphere in not unequivocally condemning the Honduran coup. Indeed, the Obama administration has refused to call it a coup, which, under American law, would tie Washington’s hands as to the amount of support it could give the coup government. This denial of reality still persists even though a US embassy cable released by Wikileaks in 2010 declared: “There is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 [2009] in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch”. Washington’s support of the far-right Honduran government has been unwavering ever since.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The questions concerning immigration into the United States from south of the border go on year after year, with the same issues argued back and forth: What’s the best way to block the flow into the country? How shall we punish those caught here illegally? Should we separate families, which happens when parents are deported but their American-born children remain? Should the police and various other institutions have the right to ask for proof of legal residence from anyone they suspect of being here illegally? Should we punish employers who hire illegal immigrants? Should we grant amnesty to at least some of the immigrants already here for years? … on and on, round and round it goes, decade after decade. Those in the US generally opposed to immigration make it a point to declare that the United States does not have any moral obligation to take in these Latino immigrants.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But the counter-argument to this last point is almost never mentioned: Yes, the United States does indeed have a moral obligation because so many of the immigrants are escaping a situation in their homeland made hopeless by American intervention and policy. In addition to Honduras, Washington overthrew progressive governments which were sincerely committed to fighting poverty in Guatemala and Nicaragua; while in El Salvador the US played a major role in suppressing a movement striving to install such a government. And in Mexico, though Washington has not intervened militarily since 1919, over the years the US has been providing training, arms, and surveillance technology to Mexico’s police and armed forces to better their ability to suppress their own people’s aspirations, as in Chiapas, and this has added to the influx of the oppressed to the United States, irony notwithstanding.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, Washington’s North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has brought a flood of cheap, subsidized US agricultural products into Mexico, ravaging campesino communities and driving many Mexican farmers off the land when they couldn’t compete with the giant from the north. The subsequent Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has brought the same joys to the people of that area.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">These “free trade” agreements – as they do all over the world – also result in government enterprises being privatized, the regulation of corporations being reduced, and cuts to the social budget. Add to this the displacement of communities by foreign mining projects and the drastic US-led militarization of the War on Drugs with accompanying violence and you have the perfect storm of suffering followed by the attempt to escape from suffering.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It’s not that all these people prefer to live in the United States. They’d much rather remain with their families and friends, be able to speak their native language at all times, and avoid the hardships imposed on them by American police and other right-wingers.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">M’lady Hillary</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Madame Clinton, in her new memoir, referring to her 2002 Senate vote supporting military action in Iraq, says: “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In a 2006 TV interview, Clinton said: “Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn’t have been a vote. And I certainly wouldn’t have voted that way.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On October 16, 2002 the US Congress adopted a joint resolution titled “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq”. This was done in the face of numerous protests and other political events against an American invasion.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On February 15, 2003, a month before the actual invasion, there was a coordinated protest around the world in which people in some 60 countries marched in a last desperate attempt to stop the war from happening. It has been described as “the largest protest event in human history.” Estimations of the total number of participants involved reach 30 million. The protest in Rome involved around three million people, and is listed in the 2004 Guinness Book of World Records as the largest anti-war rally in history. Madrid hosted the second largest rally with more than 1½ million protesters. About half a million marched in the United States. How many demonstrations in support of the war can be cited? It can be said that the day was one of humanity’s finest moments.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">So what did all these people know that Hillary Clinton didn’t know? What information did they have access to that she as a member of Congress did not have?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The answer to both questions is of course “Nothing”. She voted the way she did because she was, as she remains today, a wholly committed supporter of the Empire and its unending wars.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And what did the actual war teach her? Here she is in 2007, after four years of horrible death, destruction and torture:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“The American military has done its job. Look what they accomplished. They got rid of Saddam Hussein. They gave the Iraqis a chance for free and fair elections. They gave the Iraqi government the chance to begin to demonstrate that it understood its responsibilities to make the hard political decisions necessary to give the people of Iraq a better future. So the American military has succeeded.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">And she spoke the above words at a conference of liberals, committed liberal Democrats and others further left. She didn’t have to cater to them with any flag-waving pro-war rhetoric; they wanted to hear anti-war rhetoric (and she of course gave them a tiny bit of that as well out of the other side of her mouth), so we can assume that this is how she really feels, if indeed the woman feels anything. The audience, it should be noted, booed her, for the second year in a row.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“We came, we saw, he died.” – Hillary Clinton as US Secretary of State, <em>giggling</em>, as she referred to the uncivilized and utterly depraved murder of Moammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Imagine Osama bin Laden or some other Islamic leader speaking of September 11, 2001: “We came, we saw, 3,000 died, ha-ha.”</p>

<p>The epidemic of stupidity in the USA has risen to new heights with the widespread public, political and media support for the tens of thousands of illegal immigrants from Central America invading the country from Mexico.  Those protesting the way the government is behaving are being attacked.</p>
<p>The narrative goes like this: Oh those poor children and mothers escaping incredibly awful conditions want nothing more than a decent life in the USA, and why not?  After all we are a nation of immigrants.  How could we deny giving these suffering kids and mothers a place in our nation?  Never mind the legitimate sanctity of our borders.</p>
<p>A sure sign of disgraceful and all too frequent media bias is use of the terms “migrants” and “undocumented immigrants” instead of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>But here is where the real stupidity comes in.  What could amount to from 50,000 to 100,000 of these illegal immigrants crashing into our nation at considerable expense is nothing compared to the many millions of kids and mothers in many places globally also suffering admittedly terrible conditions.  What about all those in Africa, the Middle East and the desperately poor in India, for example?  Sadly, in all too many places, children with or without their parents are plagued by disease, violence, starvation, exploitation and abandonment.</p>
<p>So it is rational to ask: What if millions of people, both parents and children, seeking nothing more than a better life in the USA were to make it across any of our borders?  Should we not also let them come in and stay?  Are those from a few Central American countries intrinsically deserving of better treatment?  Are some illegal immigrants more deserving than others?</p>
<p>Can any nation maintain sovereign self respect and ensure its own economic future by allowing huge numbers of illegal immigrants to enter and stay in its country?  I say absolutely NO!</p>
<p>I want to see a nationwide grassroots uprising that vigorously protests what is now happening.  More Americans need to envision a lifeboat that sinks into the ocean because more and more floundering, desperate people beg to be let into the lifeboat and the idiots already in the lifeboat acquiesce.  So they all sink and perish.  Welcome to Lifeboat America.</p>
<p>Here is an idea for the insanely barbaric Islamic radicals filled with hatred for the USA:  Start to replace your many ideas on how to use violence to defeat the USA with plans to ship suffering kids and mothers by any means across any of our borders.  Think big.  Think in terms of sending a few million sufferers to the USA.  Get them on boats and airplanes.  Don’t use explosives on airplanes.  Use the worst off kids and mothers instead.  Finance their transport to the USA.  Then sit back and watch Lifeboat USA sink.</p>
<p>Wake up Americans.  This illegal immigration situation is not about compassion and humanitarian assistance.  It is sheer illogical stupidity.  If we do not rationally and intelligently control illegal immigration, we have no future for most Americans.  Our political system is clearly dysfunctional.  Too many politicians seek an advantage by being illegal immigrant friendly; too many people in the business sector want to ensure low cost labor.</p>
<p>We cannot expect immediate rational action from the two-party duopoly and greed driven oligarchy.  Not unless many millions of Americans understand that illegal immigration is a life or death issue for the country they profess to love.  A big picture, longer term perspective supports government policy that requires all new illegal immigrants be immediately sent back to their country of origin.  Anything other than this creates widespread motivation in foreign countries and among those making money from transporting illegal immigrants to keep sending more and more illegal immigrants across our borders. What would stop this madness?  The longer it goes on, the more difficult it becomes to stop it.</p>

<p>When you look at the chaos and destruction going on in the Mid-East today you are looking at the future of America. This is not by mistake or incompetence but by design.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">After WWI the British and French created new countries out of the area in the Mid-East and in doing so created future states that would be unstable and ultimately fail to have national cohesion. The unnatural boundaries of these states thrust together people of different beliefs and set the stage for generations of turmoil.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">When you look at the things going on in America today it is easy to see the similarities with this plan. To the south, our borders are open and a mass of humanity is flooding in and changing the demographics of the southwest. Further to the north our northern states are being flooded with Muslim refugees and changing the demographics there. At the same time, patriotic Americans are being demonized by the government and along with Christians and veterans are being pushed toward civil war by Government actions.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">When you consider the Mid-East and look at the U.S it becomes easy to see the plan unfolding to create chaos here and prevent Americans from uniting against the forces that want to prepare us for subjugation.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Why would anyone want to create a failed state? It became the conclusion of the British elite many years ago that a a failed state was the easiest to control. With the internal population always warring against one another, outside forces could do as they please in the country with little hindrance from a disunited population.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">With the U.S. overrun with people from other countries that do not share the same values as Americans and instead practice their own beliefs and continue to speak their own language, it is only a matter of time before America becomes chaotic and infighting begins. This will give cover to others to subjugate and control America that would not be possible by any other means.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Unchecked immigration is the only way to dilute the American demographics enough to cause fighting among diverse groups and make subjugation easier. There has always been animosity among some groups in America but not enough to start a war as most Americans could see that would destroy the good life they were leading. Many Americans know the government is trying to instigate civil war in this country but cannot understand why. Now you see the reasons in a different light and may understand a little better what is happening now.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">A united America is the only thing holding back the subjugation of this nation and it is being undermined with many types of subversion that will tear the fabric of this nation and send it on its way to chaos. Everywhere you look, various groups are being pitted against one another, whites against blacks, blacks against Hispanics, liberals against conservatives, Christians against Muslims, homosexuals against heterosexuals, gun owners against gun controllers and cops against citizens just to name a few. It is all orchestrated to bring about one thing, a dysfunctional country that is easy to handle. Its hard to unite and fight the government and bankers when you are busy fighting your neighbors every day.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Many understand the global ponzi scheme of fiat currencies will collapse soon thrusting most people back onto their own resources. During this collapse, global interests cannot risk the potential of citizens to come together under nationalism and work for their own best interests. Citizens must be divided and fighting one another to insure the globalists can sweep in and take total control of populations and resources. A united America with lots of weapons will make this plan impossible. Hence the need for gun control and division.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">This is the plan now unfolding in America and the more people that realize it the more control we will retain as things become chaotic. If these groups would understand how they are being used it would be easier to prevent open hostilities that would benefit a select group in the future and ultimately destroy the nation we now know. With the masses under the influence of mainstream media, it is a good bet that many will fall into this globalist trap. The only thing we can do now is prepare for the worst.</p>

<p>If millions of soldiers from south of the border were flooding our nation for the purposes of colonizing our land, we would easily recognize the threat. And if some amongst us were aiding and abetting this invasion — purposely lowering border security to facilitate it — we’d know what to call them. And we’d know how they should be dealt with.</p>
<p>This comes to mind when considering the flood of humanity that does continually pour across our border, a phenomenon whose most recent manifestation is the children’s crusade (which includes many teens, some of whom are gang members) currently in the news. Oh, the people trespassing on our land aren’t wearing uniforms; they aren’t wielding cold steel. But this isn’t always necessary. As Muammar Gaddafi once pointed out, some invasions are prosecuted “without sword, without gun, without conquest.” “We don’t need terrorists; we don’t need homicide bombers,” he said. “The 50 plus million Muslims [in Europe] will turn it into the Muslim Continent within a few decades.” Of course, in the waning West, we call this “diversity” and “demographic change.”</p>
<p>And as we’re being diversified into a country definitely not Western via demographic warfare, as we euphemize from sunrise to the sunset of our demise, something is exactly the same as in my opening example:</p>
<p>There are those amongst us aiding and abetting this invasion.</p>
<p>We can start with the fact that Barack Obama and his fellow travelers have sparked this most recent human wave with promises of amnesty for young illegals. Obama has also hobbled immigration enforcement, which itself is a euphemistic way of saying that he has, like a fifth column, cleared the way for an invading force. Adding insult to injury, not only is there no effort at deportation, but his administration’s first response to the children’s crusade was to provide lawyers for the illegals — paid for with your tax money — to help make these reinforcements permanent.</p>
<p>In fact, Obama is so intent on aiding the invasion that he has served notice that if Congress won’t be complicit in his scheme, he will use an executive order to help the foreign boots on the ground.</p>
<p>Question: what do you call such a person?</p>
<p>Of course, this is nothing new. We have had seven amnesties in recent decades, and all the way through there were promises to secure the border. It never happened. Fool me once, shame on you. And if they can fool you seven times?</p>
<p>You’re a doormat.</p>
<p>There’s only one thing foreign boots on the ground do to doormats, mind you — and it isn’t to show respect and gratitude.</p>
<p>It’s obvious why leftists such as Obama have long facilitated immigration: they are importing voters. Upwards of 80 percent of the new arrivals will vote Democrat upon being naturalized. And is this any surprise? Most all illegals — and a majority of <em>legal immigrants</em> — hail from Hispanic nations, which are notoriously socialist (only the degree varies). And people don’t suddenly change ideology just because they change location.</p>
<p>This brings us to Republicans who claim that Hispanics are a “natural conservative constituency” and that all the GOP need do is offer the olive branch of amnesty. Theirs is an imagination that could put Gene Roddenberry to shame.</p>
<p>While Hispanics do generally favor amnesty, the main thing the majority of them want is what they voted for in their socialist homelands: big government. Don’t believe me, Karl? Just consider recent Pew research (hat tip: American Thinker’s <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2014/06/political_earthquake_as_david_brat_handily_defeats_eric_cantor_in_primary.html">Thomas Lifson</a>) showing that only 19 percent of Hispanics favor a smaller government while a whopping 75 percent prefer a bigger one. Of course, assimilation is the answer, right? Take a gander at the rest of the Pew data:</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/pewpoll3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>And what does this equate to once Hispanic majority status is reached (along with the leftward drift of non-Hispanic whites)?</p>
<ul>
<li>19- 75 = government of Venezuela</li>
<li>36-58 = government of Mexico</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, modern immigration = death of America.</p>
<p>And to reiterate, this doesn’t mean just <em>illegal</em> migration. Ever since Ted Kennedy’s immigration act of 1965, 85 percent of our legal immigrants have hailed from the Third World and Asia. So in terms of demographic and ideological change, there is <em>no difference between legal and illegal migration</em>.</p>
<p>Yet it isn’t just Hispanic immigrants. One reason I favor a moratorium on all immigration is that we face a largely socialist world. Where would we find immigrants amenable to authentic Americanism? Europe? China? Africa? The Middle East? The only exception may be Russia, but I wouldn’t want to bet my culture on that, either.</p>
<p>While I’ve framed this ideologically, it can be defined culturally and racially (gasp!), too. And I won’t shrink from this since it is exactly what the left is doing.</p>
<p>There’s an old saying, if you can’t get the people to change the government, change the people. Here’s a simple fact: what we call traditional conservatism is a phenomenon of Christian, European-descent people (modern Europeans no longer qualify because of their secularism). One can debate the reasons for this, but it is plainly true. It’s why almost 90 percent of GOP voters are white and almost 90 percent are Christian; it’s why church attendance is one of the best predictors of voting patterns. Mind you, this doesn’t mean that other groups won’t contain <em>some</em> conservatives, but the fact is that no other major group is majority conservative.</p>
<p>Then there is that uncomfortable truth: Obama and many other leftists hate what they see as “white America”— Obama described white culture as “alien” in his book <em>Dreams from My Father</em> — and they want to destroy it as fast as possible. This is why, while giving the 1998 commencement address at Oregon’s Portland State University, Bill Clinton spoke glowingly of the day when whites become a minority in America (to the uproarious cheers of the mostly white students).</p>
<p>Of course, this is where Obama, Clinton and the rest of the fifth column will say that if you’re not cheering, you’re a bigot.</p>
<p>If the Joneses were somehow gaining access to the Smith’s home, squatting there and slowly taking over while the police refused to enforce trespassing laws, no one would wonder if the Smiths objected. The fact that Joneses aren’t Smiths would be explanation enough. Or let’s say that millions of Chinese were flooding the Ivory Coast, were supplanting African culture and threatening to soon outnumber the Africans. Would we be surprised if the Ivorians were up in arms? Would anthropologists call the transformation anything but cultural genocide?</p>
<p>Again, though, we call this diversity. But there’s a funny thing about that oh-so necessary quality:</p>
<p>It’s only encouraged in Western lands.</p>
<p>If diversity is such an imperative, why don’t we push it in Saudi Arabia, Japan, Tunisia or Rwanda? And don’t tell me we’re just minding our own business, as Obama thought nothing of parading around Africa last year <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100025635/labours-secret-plan-to-lure-immigrants-was-borderline-treason-and-plain-stupid/">preaching</a> about homosexual rights.</p>
<p>The truth is that when liberals say “Our strength lies in our diversity,” they really mean <em>their</em> strength. They’re building a solid socialist majority that won’t blink at leftist corruption because these new arrivals are inured to it — corruption is status quo in their native lands.</p>
<p>And what else can we say about these migrants? Most are just coming to the US to make money, while some have criminal designs. But what is certain is that even if they were capable of shedding deep-seated socialist instincts, they’re not coming here to become American — in spirit. And they’re casting votes Americans won’t cast.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, a former Labour (Britain’s liberal party) speechwriter created a firestorm by revealing that the UK government had encouraged unfettered immigration “to rub the Right’s nose in diversity.” This prompted <em>The Telegraph’s</em> Ed West to <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100025635/labours-secret-plan-to-lure-immigrants-was-borderline-treason-and-plain-stupid/">call</a> the leftists’ plan “borderline treason.”</p>
<p>Borderline? I think that’s another border that was brazenly crossed. And does this kind of behavior deserve any less damning a characterization on our side of the pond?</p>

</div>
<p>This article will be a departure from my usual fare. I will not claim there is some Absolute Truth deeming soccer the bane of humanity’s sports. I do not contend that some objective, divine standard places it in Dante’s ninth circle of athletic arenas, though I wish I could. Sport is a matter of taste, and, as G.K. Chesterton said (okay, so this isn’t a complete departure for me — I’m quoting Chesterton), “There are no uninteresting subjects, only uninterested people.” I get it. And I, I confess, like golf. So mock away. But in this piece I’ll ditch the Mr. Spock act, let my human side emote, may even contradict myself, and will say something.</p>
<p>I hate soccer.</p>
<p>I hear there’s something going on right now called the World Cup. I hear it’s in Brazil. I hear other pundits, such as <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/why-soccer-is-un-american-107793.html?ml=po_r#.U5tj_4whmRN">Stephen Webb</a> and <a href="http://americanthinker.com/blog/2014/06/soccer_haters_unite_the_game_is_unamerican.html">Rick Moran</a>, are commenting on it, taking opposing views. And I hear that the score between the two is 0-0 after 2000 words. But I won’t claim that soccer is un-American as did Webb or like Moran, claim it’s fun. I’ll say something truly intellectual.</p>
<p>I hate soccer.</p>
<p>When I grew up in the Bronx in the ‘70s, few played that infernal game. I was exposed to it, but could never relate. Why can’t I use my hands? I mean, I have hands. They’re remarkably dexterous appendages. They exist to manipulate all manner of things in the physical universe. I preferred tennis and ping pong to handball, sure, but that was understandable. The racquets and paddles are tools that facilitate the striking of a ball; with them you can achieve a degree of velocity and spin — which could curve the ball in fascinating ways — otherwise impossible. And velocity and spin are cool. It’s as if I need to pound a nail: I take my hand and pick up a hammer. I don’t use my foot.</p>
<p>That’s the crux of this entirely taste-oriented matter. It goes without saying that professional soccer players are highly skilled. But to me it’s like seeing those unfortunate double amputees who’ve learned to paint or play the piano with their toes. I say, “Wow, it’s amazing how man’s spirit can overcome.” Then I change the channel and look for something that can fill the hour’s remaining 59 minutes and 35 seconds.</p>
<p>So if soccer were in the Special Olympics, I’d understand it. Or maybe if it were played by birds. But why do human beings, with their particular anatomical configuration, want to use their feet for a task performed infinitely better by the hands? It’s no wonder the scoring in soccer tends to hover around Joe Biden I.Q. territory. How many baskets would be sunk in the NBA if the players had to kick the ball through the hoop, even if they could block only with their heads? How poor would the scores be in golf if you had to kick the ball down the fairway? A braggart may say, “I can beat you with one hand tied behind my back.” Soccer players try to beat each other with both tied.</p>
<p>Mr. Moran correctly pointed out that, contrary to Mr. Webb’s assumption, soccer is now tremendously popular in the US. I must attribute this, in part, to the influx of people from lands where they can’t afford to play much of anything but soccer. And while I’ve often “inveighed” against immigration, to use the word Rep. John Conyers (D-Soccer) did when citing my work upon waking up briefly in the House, our foreign soccer imports might be the best reason to rethink our immigration regime. “Do you play socc…er…fútbol, amigo?</p>
<p>Si?</p>
<p>See ya’.”</p>
<p>Check the deportation column.</p>
<p>Call it the Immigration and Recreation Reform Act of 2014. Entry into the US would be limited to those with a history of participation in polo or yacht racing.</p>
<p>So save those feet for what they were meant to do, such as kicking illegals out of the country, kicking Cantors out of office and kicking the economy into gear. A hand is a terrible thing to waste.</p>

			<h2>Three Pertinent Observations</h2>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/las-vegas-shooting-miller-3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p><strong>*The Las Vegas Shootings</strong></p>
<p>Predictably, the mainstream media is doing its best to try to depict the couple who killed three people (including two police officers) in Las Vegas as right-wing militia-types. No doubt, the Obama administration will try to conjure up more gun-control. The media is already attempting to link the killers to the brave citizens who defended the Bundy family a couple of months ago. But the truth is, the citizen-militia in Bunkerville would not even allow this couple to gain access to that event, as they were concerned about the couple’s disconcerting propensities. But, of course, the radical left-wing hate group, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), won’t tell you that.</p>
<p>Watch for Eric Holder and the U.S. Justice Department to use the Las Vegas shootings as an excuse to harass and harangue conservative groups, Tea Party groups, Second Amendment groups, and Patriot groups. And, of course, the media will serve in its typical capacity as propagandists against all things conservative.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the administration’s war against freedom-minded people takes on a chilling dimension when one reads this report:</p>
<p>“The Justice Department is resurrecting a program designed to thwart domestic threats to the United States, and Attorney General Eric Holder says those threats include individuals the government deems anti-government or racially prejudiced.</p>
<p>“The Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee was created in the wake of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing but was scrapped soon after the 2001 terrorist attacks as intelligence and law enforcement officials shifted their focus to threats from outside the country. The committee will be comprised of figures from the FBI, the National Security Division of the Justice Department and the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee.”</p>
<p>See the report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnd.com%2F2014%2F06%2Fnow-thought-crime-is-terror-in-u-s%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDZz6Ga1OPpeoApp2FLNIJSg7x7g" target="_blank">Now Thought Crime Is Terror In U.S.?</a></p>
<p>However, the fact is, when one examines the political bents of recent mass killers, he or she will find that the majority of them have come from left-wing communities and ideologies. But the media totally ignores that part of the story. They also ignore the common thread of most of these killers being on psychotropic prescription drugs. And they also conveniently overlook the fact that the vast majority of these kinds of killings took place in “gun-free” zones.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I have serious questions about the way in which so many of these mass shootings take place including: witnesses reporting multiple assailants, even when eventually only one shooter is said to have done it; the vast majority of these assailants ultimately killing themselves; the way the media is unwilling to investigate contradicting evidence and testimony; and the way law enforcement seems more inclined to cover up evidence than actually trace it all the way to its source.</p>
<p><strong>*Obama’s Dumping of Illegal Aliens in Arizona and Texas</strong></p>
<p>It is now abundantly clear that the Obama administration has chosen to completely ignore federal immigration laws. His administration is mostly refusing to deport illegals&#8211;even criminal ones. It is also encouraging the release of thousands of criminal illegals (even violent ones) from America’s prisons and jails.</p>
<p>See this report:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Farticle-2626593%2FU-S-immigration-officials-released-thousands-violent-criminals-2013.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFG56MXY-4fg_ZPzLLtG3o9swfimQ" target="_blank">U.S. Immigration Officials Released Thousands of Violent Criminals in 2013, Report Says</a></p>
<p>And, now we learn that the administration is manipulating the “dumping” of thousands of illegals, many of whom are children, in the traditional Republican stronghold states of Arizona and Texas. Through Obama’s public statements and comments, the administration has willfully encouraged multiplied thousands of illegals to cross into America’s border states, especially the two states mentioned above.</p>
<p>But why isn’t the Republican Party challenging President Obama on this egregious and blatant illegal activity? The GOP is already poised to pick up many seats in both the U.S. House and Senate this fall due to the anger and resentment of the country against Obama’s dubious and nefarious policies. One would think that Republican leaders on The Hill would pounce on Obama’s immigration debacle. Instead, Republican leaders are assisting the administration’s pro-illegal alien policy by pushing amnesty for illegals&#8211;which only serves to facilitate more illegals pouring over the southern border.</p>
<p>Investors.com reports, “Republicans should take the president to task for unlawfully enticing thousands of ‘unaccompanied illegal children’ from Latin America to cross the border. Instead, a GOP leader asks for an amnesty deal.</p>
<p>“What is at the top of the Republican wish list? A vibrant economy? An America strong and respected in the world? Capturing the Senate? A Republican elected to the White House in 2016?</p>
<p>“Nah. The GOP wants amnesty for illegal aliens.”</p>
<p>The report goes on to say, “Democrats use immigration to smear Republicans as racists. Expanding immigration will give Democrats millions of new votes in the coming decades, destroying forever the political forces that oppose big government.</p>
<p>“The more than 90,000 children who crossed the Mexican border into the U.S. and were apprehended this year, and the more than 140,000 expected next year, could and should turn the immigration issue into a GOP weapon against Democrats.</p>
<p>“Instead of sending them back home to their parents, Attorney General Eric Holder made it a priority to hire taxpayer-funded lawyers for them. Why don&#8217;t we hear Cantor, Ryan and other GOP leaders shout that Democrats are exploiting children to further their political agenda?”</p>
<p>See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.investors.com%2Fibd-editorials%2F060914-704024-amnesty-obsessed-gop-wont-confront-obama-on-child-aliens.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFebkRlwbBl9bq-AwbSllcG2122Iw" target="_blank">Child Alien Crisis Is Obama’s Fault, But GOP Won’t Pounce</a></p>
<p>Why, indeed?</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is a major proponent of amnesty for illegals. (Thankfully, Republican voters in Virginia have just thrown Cantor out of Congress and nominated a Tea Party conservative to replace him. More about that in a minute.) So is Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner. So are republicans John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan, etc.</p>
<p>If the Republican Party helps Obama pass amnesty for illegals into law, as Boehner and Company say they will do this summer, Arizona and Texas will be inundated with millions of illegals&#8211;even more than they already are. Do Republican leaders really believe that illegal aliens are going to vote Republican? If they truly believe this, they are absolutely and positively deluded. So, is Boehner and Company willing to feed Arizona and Texas to the proverbial wolves? Do they think they can win a presidential election without carrying the State of Texas? Again, if they do, they are deluded.</p>
<p>Or, is Boehner and Company really more concerned about appeasing big-money interests at the Chamber of Commerce? Do they even care one whit about GOP victories? As long as they believe themselves to be the personal recipients of the graces of Big Money, why should they care which political party wins an election? At the national level, the differences between the two major parties are negligible, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>*Eric Cantor’s Primary Defeat in Virginia</strong></p>
<p>Here is how The New York Times covered the story:</p>
<p>“In one of the most stunning primary election upsets in congressional history, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, was soundly defeated on Tuesday by a Tea Party-backed economics professor who had hammered him for being insufficiently conservative.</p>
<p>“The result delivered a major jolt to the Republican Party&#8211;Mr. Cantor had widely been considered the top candidate to succeed Speaker John A. Boehner&#8211;and it has potential to change both the debate in Washington on immigration and, possibly, the midterm elections.</p>
<p>“With just over $200,000, David Brat&#8211;a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va.&#8211;toppled Mr. Cantor, repeatedly criticizing him for being soft on immigration and contending that he supported what critics call amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally.</p>
<p>“Republicans were so sure that Mr. Cantor would win that most party leaders had been watching for how broad his victory would be. His defeat will reverberate in the capital and could have major implications for any chance of an immigration overhaul.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F06%2F11%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Feric-cantor-loses-gop-primary.html%3F_r%3D1&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVeDkMAikX__8bPDUa0w-KnjMogQ" target="_blank">Eric Cantor Defeated by David Brat, Tea Party Challenger, in G.O.P. Primary Upset</a></p>
<p>Cantor’s defeat offers a glimmer of hope for America’s future. It is my studied observation that these neocon Republicans are far more dangerous to our liberties than are Democrats. When forced to choose between a Democrat and a neocon Republican, the “lesser of two evils” vote is for the Democrat. We have such an example here in my home State of Montana.</p>
<p>In the GOP primary for U.S. House of Representatives, a neocon Republican named Ryan Zinke won with just 33% of the vote. That means that some 67% of Montana’s Republican voters chose someone else over Zinke&#8211;all of whom were decidedly more conservative than Zinke. Unfortunately, Montana does not have a run-off system; otherwise, there is absolutely no question that Zinke would have been trounced in any subsequent run-off.</p>
<p>If Zinke wins in November, his track record in the Montana State Senate demonstrates that he will be the quintessential neocon Republican in Washington, D.C. Any influence he would have in Congress would only serve to take the House leftward. I absolutely refuse to vote for a neocon like Ryan Zinke. A Zinke victory would only serve to counter-balance the defeat of Eric Cantor in Virginia.</p>
<p>And, as The New York Times report observed, Cantor’s loss was primarily due to his liberal policies&#8211;especially his support for amnesty for illegals. Hopefully, Cantor’s historic defeat will shock the GOP leadership into a little bit of political reality.</p>
<p>Now, if we could only clean the GOP house of the likes of Boehner, McCain, Graham, Ryan, etc., and stop nominating neocons like Zinke. And God help us if Republicans nominate someone like Jeb Bush or Chris Christie in 2016.</p>

				<p>June 9, 2014 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20602#respond" title="Comment on Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl: Obama’s Waterloo"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="20602 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20602">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>

</div>
<p>In the past week, we discovered that U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Islamic Al-Qaeda’s only prisoner of war, deserted his post while serving with his unit in Afghanistan.   Instead of a hero’s welcome, he can expect a court martial with hard time.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Barack Hussein Obama, broke the law by not conferring with Congress by giving 30 days notice when he bartered five mastermind Muslim terrorists back into their own ranks.  Obama remains in contempt of the U.S. Constitution with a new status: he faces charges of aiding and abetting the enemy.</p>
<p>Both Bergdahl and Obama face hard questions on what it means to be serving our country.  Both clearly think themselves above the law.  Both clearly broke the law.  Both need to face a court of justice.</p>
<p>“Yes, we resented Bergdahl,” said Evan Buetow, Bergdahl’s former Army team leader.  “And we were upset with the fact that we were looking for this guy who we knew walked away.”</p>
<p>After Bergdahl deserted, six Army soldiers lost their lives trying to recover a man who walked away from his post.  When the dust settles, Bergdahl faces a court martial for desertion. He faces hard time in a military prison.</p>
<p>Before he deserted, he emailed his parents this final note:  “The US Army is the biggest joke the world has to laugh at. It is the army of liars, backstabbers, fools and bullies.”</p>
<p>His father, a Muslim, wrote back, “Dear Bowe, In matters of life and death, and especially at war, it is never safe to ignore one’s conscience.”</p>
<p>Three days later, at 5:30 a.m., a fellow soldier tried to awaken Bergdahl for guard duty.  His body armor and weapon remained, but Bergdahl vanished.</p>
<p>A Pentagon investigation concluded in 2010 that the evidence proved incontrovertibly that Bergdahl walked away from his unit.   If Army brass fulfills their command duties, Bergdahl faces prison for desertion.   He faces the wrath of the families of six other Army soldiers who lost their lives trying to recover the deserter. </p>
<p>On top of that intrigue on the world stage, Mr. Barack Obama, already shredding the U.S. Constitution with his “Fast and Furious” gun running,  Benghazi cover-up, granting amnesty unlawfully, his lack of a valid Social Security number, sealing all his records to conceal his very questionable past, lack of enforcing our immigration laws, suing states to stop them from enforcing their immigration laws—and the list grows—now faces “aiding and abetting” the enemy by turning over, not just five Muslim ground grunts, but five of the biggest masterminds of the Islamic terrorist network.  Those guys return to planning the next 9/11.  How stupid would that make Barack Obama, himself a Muslim by his own admission?  Answer: pretty smart!  He captured the White House and now he aids the Islamic enemy by returning their best mastermind killers.</p>
<p>Additionally, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard P. McKeon (R-CA) and the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, James M. Inhofe (R-OK), wrote in a statement, “Trading five senior Taliban leaders from detention in Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl’s release may have consequences for the rest of our forces and all Americans. Our terrorist adversaries now have a strong incentive to capture Americans. That incentive will put our forces in Afghanistan and around the world at even greater risk.”</p>
<p>The President broke the law by releasing the five GITMO terrorists. The law requires our sitting president to notify Congress at least 30 days in advance before transferring any prisoner out of GITMO. He gave no notification. He made a unilateral decision. There needs to be a full investigation and consequences – articles of impeachment, for starters.</p>
<p>What questions does this entire fiasco in our foreign policy bring to mind?  Who runs our government if not a mob of madmen?  What will history report on this myopic, misguided and dishonest president? </p>
<p>Why do we remain in Afghanistan for 12 years of killing, social insanity and over $1 trillion wasted on a goat-herder Islamic society?  What kinds of minds drive such stupid, insidious and mindless wars like Iraq and Afghanistan?  Why do we “educated and freedom-loving” Americans allow such stupidity to continue?   Why do we allow our own government to carry on “private wars” with a volunteer army for the profits of corporations and bankers?</p>
<p>Is Bergdahl guilty of desertion or did he wake up to America’s war-prone insanity?  Is Obama a sagacious president or a chronic liar? </p>
<p>We citizens of this Constitutional Republic need to ask ourselves if we want to continue our apathy that allows such pathetic leadership or engage in electing leaders who truly work for the intelligent future of America.   If we elect more Obama’s, Harry Reid’s, Charles Schumer’s, John McCain’s, Mark Udall’s,  Orrin Hatch’s, Barbara Boxer’s, Diane Feinstein’s and the like—we shall endure more Afghanistan’s with all the insanity created by endless wars and incompetent decisions by incompetent presidents.</p>

<p>During my youth, I grew up as a “Service Brat.”  My dad served 27 years in the U.S. Marine Corps.  I respected God, the Stars and Stripes, America and our presidents without question.  I loved my mom’s apple pie!</p>
<p>However, credible researches discovered that President Franklin D. Roosevelt “let” Pearl Harbor occur to draw public support to jump the United States into World War II.</p>
<p>Our kids fought the Korean War because somebody in Harry S. Truman’s circle decided we needed to stop communism over 10,000 miles from our shores.  The best bet on who started the Korean War:  a banker, a corporation head or anyone hoping to make enormous gains off mass deaths.</p>
<p>By the time Vietnam conscripted and killed a lot of my friends, as well as my own time in the U.S. Army, I learned about lies, corruption, bankers and the real reason for Vietnam.  I learned that presidents lie. They think nothing of sacrificing young men in ridiculous wars such as Lyndon Baines Johnson’s onslaught of Southeast Asia.  He killed over 2.3 million Vietnamese and 58,319 of our young men.  He ruined millions of lives, families and the environment with Agent Orange.</p>
<p>Years later, George W. Bush “created” the Iraq War on his lies and deceptions of “Weapons of Mass Destruction.”  He destroyed an entire functioning civilization, brought endless death and misery to God knows how many people.  We’re still fighting and dying in Afghanistan over a year since bin Laden died at the hands of Navy Seals.</p>
<p>Highly decorated U.S. General Smedley Butler, upon retiring, wrote a book that every American should read:  War is a Racket.  The only people who benefit from war: bankers, munitions manufacturers, clothing and food producers and corporations. They make a lot of money off death of our citizen soldiers.</p>
<p>General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us about the “Military Industrial Complex” that engineers wars, global tensions and anything to shove our kids into uniform and battles.  Congress and presidents shoved our noses into everybody else’s business for decades.</p>
<p>We didn’t listen to Butler.  We “supported” all those wars via massive “advertising” that a “threat” awaited us.  Those wars made a lot of CEOs filthy rich.</p>
<p>In 1971, defense expert Daniel Ellsberg presented the Pentagon Papers exposing the incredible corruption and widening of the Vietnam War by Nixon and Johnson before him—all based on lies.</p>
<p>Last week, NBC’s Brian Williams interviewed “whistleblower” intelligence officer Edward Snowden about the National Security Agency’s incredible spying on American citizens.    I watched the entire interview: Snowden showed himself to be incredibly honest, forthright, concerned, all-American, he honors the U.S. Constitution and he is a man of principles.  He chronicled his work in the government that opened him to the corruption at the highest offices in our government. </p>
<p>Secretary of State Kerry called Snowden a “Traitor, coward and should come home to face the music.”</p>
<p>Daniel Ellsberg responded, “Kerry’s remarks are despicable!”</p>
<p>I agree.  We need 10,000 Edward Snowden’s.  In America today, we face incredible corruption in our Congress and Mr. Obama himself.  The list grows:  Fast and Furious, won’t enforce our immigration laws, phony Social Security number, Benghazi killings, suing states from enforcing their own laws, continue to fund 10 year wars when they know they are futile, and on and on.  The corruption in Congress runs wide, deep and sickening from 20 and 30 year career Senators and Congressmen swimming in lies, cheating and playing the American people. Insider military trading on the stock market, paid off by corporations to NOT enforce our immigration laws and another 100 crimes against the American people.</p>
<p>“So many things we are told are untrue,” said Snowden.  “The Iraq War was launched on false premises.  We were led by false statements to go into Iraq.”</p>
<p>I can stand with Snowden because I know we marched into Vietnam on the same false statements such as the “Gulf of Tonkin Incident.”</p>
<p>When he tried to notify superiors, they said, “You should stop asking questions.”</p>
<p>I faced the same thing when I served as an officer in the U.S. Army.  I learned to never question orders.  If I did, command officers ridiculed me. I learned quickly to follow the military protocol.</p>
<p>Snowden said, “I watched the government’s dishonesty.  What was going on needed to be told to the public. I did nothing to harm the citizens or soldiers of America.”</p>
<p>Williams asked, “Why won’t you come home and face the music?”</p>
<p>“The Espionage Act states that you cannot have a defense,” said Snowden.  “The music is not an open court or fair trail.”</p>
<p>“Are you blameless,” asked Williams.</p>
<p>“The most important idea is that what is right may not be legal,” said Snowden.</p>
<p>I can attest to that fact.  Once the man or “group” who gained George Bush’s ear turned the crank to initiate the Iraq War, no sane, rational or reasoning man could stop it.</p>
<p>“We are seeing an erosion and obstruction of our rights as citizens under the NSA,” said Snowden.  “I felt that I was/am serving my country and protecting my fellow citizens.  Even one of the U.S. Senators said that bulk surveillance is unacceptable.  We see senior officials taking powers they don’t warrant.  In the end, I did the right thing.”</p>
<p>I applaud Snowden. If more Snowden’s stood up in the face of withering criticism or “following the power elites” that create wars or spy on our own citizens or recklessly endanger our country—none of our kids would have died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Desert Storm or Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Look to career U.S. Senators like Feinstein, Boxer, Reid, Udall, Bennet, McCain, Kyle, Schumer, Levin, Kerry, Durbin, Kennedy, Hatch, Graham and dozens of other senators for their complicity in driving this country into needless wars, not defending our borders, slamming us into $18 trillion debt and putting all of us at risk.  For example: the current S744, passed by the Senate last year, guarantees our country spirals into the demographic, cultural and linguistic toilet.  Yet, the damned fools passed it.  I recall Mark Twain’s sage words, “Suppose you are an idiot and suppose you are a member of Congress…ah but I repeat myself.”</p>
<p>We should welcome Edward Snowden home as a national hero, and, at the same time shouting out to Secretary of State John Kerry, “You’re despicable beyond measure.” </p>

<p>I almost never try to speak for other people. However, I think it is fairly safe to say that the average military recruit firmly believes that he joins the military so that you and I can live and breathe in freedom. To be sure, he had other reasons for joining, but I think the defense of liberty is a fairly common characteristic.</p>
<p>That is certainly what I thought when I was in Navy boot camp in Orlando, Florida, in 1983. After all, this is what I had been told all my life: sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines defend freedom.</p>
<p>But is this actually what they do?</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Marine lost both legs in an IED blast in Iraq. He claims he was forced by TSA to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/mar/19/tsa-agents-humiliated-wounded-marine-aggressive-in/" target="_blank">remove both prosthetic legs</a> before he could board an airplane in Phoenix.</li>

<li>In 1997, four sailors from the USS Saipan (LHA-2) were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19Norfolk-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">falsely accused</a> of the rape and murder of a Norfolk, Virginia, woman. One spent eight-and-one-half years in prison while the other three were sentenced to life in prison. These three were pardoned in 2009. Even though the actual killer is serving a life sentence, four innocent men are still required to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Four" target="_blank">register as sex offenders</a> and are still <a href="http://www.norfolkfour.com/" target="_blank">fighting to clear their names</a>.</li>

<li>These veterans say they are being required to <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/03/va-says-routine-is-to-threaten-vets-gun-rights/" target="_blank">prove they are worthy of gun rights</a>.

<li>Eileen Erickson’s husband Sid served in Vietnam and died of Agent Orange exposure. Erickson is now in the crosshairs of authorities in Venice, California, who want to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-lopez-treehouse-20130911,0,6227023.column" target="_blank">tear down the tree house</a> Sid built before he died.</li>
<li>Listen to this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C430EHLtAZs" target="_blank">disabled Navy veteran plead</a> with then-Senate candidate Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) about the benefits of medical marijuana. Listen to the totalitarian response.</li>
<li>John Wrana, a 95-year-old Army Air Corps veteran of World War II, was <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-03/news/ct-met-kass-0802-20130803_1_butcher-type-kitchen-knife-park-forest-police-taser" target="_blank">tasered and then shot to death</a> by police in Forest Park, Illinois. His “crime”? Refusing medical attention.</li>
<li>John Colaprete saw action in Vietnam as a Marine Corps officer. In 1994, his Virginia Beach home and restaurants were the object of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/us/3-businessmen-testify-of-armed-raids-by-irs.html" target="_blank">paramilitary-style raids by the IRS</a>. The raid was prompted by a false accusation by a former employee. While you need to watch this documentary in its entirety some time, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">for now just pick it up for a few minutes starting at the 55:40 mark</a>.<br />

<li>Boxing legend Joe Louis was also tyrannized by the IRS. The Brown Bomber enlisted in the Army in 1942 saying “Let us at them Japs.” Louis never saw combat, as he was assigned to the Special Services Division. While still a civilian, Louis fought some charity bouts and donated the proceeds to the Navy Relief Society. The IRS, however, viewed these proceeds as taxable income. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Louis#World_War_II" target="_blank">IRS problems would plague him</a> all his life. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">Please watch this video starting at the 53:17 mark.</a></li>
<li>Adam Arroyo is a Hispanic veteran of the Iraq war who lives in Buffalo. <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130604/CITYANDREGION/130609629/1002" target="_blank">Police shot and killed his dog</a> while executing a drug warrant for a black man.</li>
<li>Henry Taylor was a retired Air Force veteran in Louisville, Tennessee, who was <a href="http://www.thedailytimes.com/Local_News/story/Blount-County-Sheriffs-deputy-shoots-kills-property-owner-during-security-check-id-039818" target="_blank">shot dead by a local sheriff’s deputy</a> while investigating a burglary at a rental property he owned.</li>
<li>This is a fascinating article: <a href="https://greendragontavern.com/CMS/GDT/articles/when-johnny-comes-marching-home...he-goes-to-jail" target="_blank">When Johnny Comes Marching Home … He Goes to Jail</a>. It is absolutely tragic how we chew up and spit out so many of those we send to “fight for our freedom.”<br />

<li>Radio talk host Adam Kokesh won the Navy Commendation Medal as a Marine in Iraq. In recent years, he has been <a href="http://libertycrier.com/avtm-4-0-crowdfunder-campaign/?utm_source=The+Liberty+Crier&amp;utm_campaign=00062d8203-The_Liberty_Crier_Daily_News_2_5_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_600843dec4-00062d8203-284780633" target="_blank">arrested several times for various non-violent protests</a>. His most recent arrest happened after he loaded a shotgun in public in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 2013. On July 10, police <a href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/2013/07/12/thoughts-on-the-police-raid-on-adam-kokesh-and-on-his-canceled-march/" target="_blank">violently raided his home and arrested him</a>. He was incarcerated for four months <a href="http://benswann.com/adam-kokesh-a-modern-day-political-prisoner/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=nl" target="_blank">without bond, bail or trial</a>. He is currently on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh" target="_blank">probation for two years</a>. You may not like Kokesh’s demeanor or approve of all of his antics, but he has been very courageous when so many of his critics can’t be bothered to put down the remote.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg?w=640" alt="james moore" /></a></li>
<li>James Moore, my brothah from anothah mothah, walked away from a very lucrative engineering position in San Jose to re-enlist in the Army following 9/11. He sustained significant physical injuries as well as PTSD while serving in the Special Forces in Afghanistan. On the afternoon of March 25, 2008, Moore, who had done absolutely nothing wrong, was <a href="http://www.freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/necessary-force.html">beaten to the point of flat lining by Denver police.</a></li>
<li>One of the coolest people I have never met is Antonio Buehler. Buehler graduated from West Point in 1999, earned his Ranger tab, and saw action in Kosovo and Iraq. (He also sports a Stanford MBA.) Early in the morning on January 1, 2012, Buehler <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVZDpGCKks" target="_blank">was arrested</a> for taking a few pictures of Austin police manhandling a young woman outside a 7-11. Buehler has been arrested four times since. He heads the <a href="http://peacefulstreets.com/" target="_blank">Peaceful Streets Project</a>, whose members work to expose abuse, brutality and overreach both in Austin and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FreeAntonioBuehler/" target="_blank">across the nation</a>.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/antonio-buehler.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/antonio-buehler.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168" alt="antonio buehler" width="300" height="168" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are no doubt numerous other injustices against veterans that I do not know about. Enough to fill a book. None of these things would have happened if America were a free society. As Kokesh puts it, “The greatest enemies to the Constitution are not to be found in the sands of some far off land but rather right here at home.”</p>
<p>I cannot speak to the specific political beliefs of most of the veterans I have mentioned here. Some may be pacifists, while others may make John McCain look like a hippie in Haight-Ashbury. No matter what their individual views may be, the freedom they risked their lives for was flagrantly violated on the streets of the land they fought to protect.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg?w=586" alt="With the ability to carry 192 nuclear warheads, just one Ohio-class submarine is the world's sixth largest nuclear power." /></a></p>
<p>Society endlessly applauds sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines for “fighting for our freedom”. It is in no way disrespectful to say that this is not what they do. No foreign government or terrorist group poses any threat to our liberty. America accounts for about half of the world’s military spending. We have 300 ships in our Navy, plus thousands of planes, tanks and nuclear warheads as well as 300 million firearms in private hands. Nobody is going to invade us.</p>
<p>In a constitutional country, which America ceased to be 100 years ago, the job of the military – a vital and most noble one – is to defend the borders, shores and airspace. It cannot protect you from being tyrannized domestically. Indeed, throughout history, armies have been instruments of domestic tyranny. Our Constitution forbids a standing army for just this reason.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tienanmen.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tienanmen.jpg?w=586" alt="Keeping'em free." /></a></p>
<p>Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia had enormous military establishments. How did things work out in these countries?</p>
<p>I am a Christian who believes liberty is a gift from God – Leviticus 25:10; II Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:1. To quote Jefferson, liberty is preserved not by military might, but by “eternal vigilance” against one’s own government at all levels. It is the grossest form of disrespect to send young men around the world to “fight for freedom” while relinquishing that freedom on the home front.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif?w=586" alt="soldier letter cartoon" /></a>For several years, America has had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate" target="_blank">world’s highest incarceration rate</a>. Since 2001, Americans have gladly accepted previously unthinkable intrusions on their freedom in the name of “safety” and “security”. These include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig6/napolitano2.html" target="_blank">warrantless searches and spying</a>, the <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hornberger/hornberger130.html" target="_blank">suspension of habeas corpus</a>, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2011/07/14/tsa-does-not-protect-you-period/" target="_blank">sexual assault as a condition of travel</a>, rampant <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/350955711587953/" target="_blank">police brutality</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/" target="_blank">indefinite detention</a> without any semblance of due process, severe <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2012/05/02/were-almost-there-now/" target="_blank">restrictions on peaceful protest</a>, massive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/03/11/1-6-billion-rounds-of-ammo-for-homeland-security-its-time-for-a-national-conversation/" target="_blank">ammunition purchases by DHS</a> and <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/the_empire_strikes_back_attack_of_the_drones" target="_blank">surveillance drones in our skies</a> watching our every move. Can <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2011/07/imperial-priorities-obedience-first.html" target="_blank">predator drones</a> be far behind?</p>
<p>And in every election 98 percent of voters put their stamp of approval on perpetuating this monstrosity.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/boston-martial-law-3-e1368935624546.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/boston-martial-law-3-e1368935624546.jpg?w=586&amp;h=528" alt="boston martial law 3" width="586" height="528" /></a></p>
<p>On April 20, 2013, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/20/but-they-got-the-suspect-thats-not-the-point/" target="_blank">Boston and several surrounding towns</a> got a <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/25/lockdowns-do-not-keep-you-safe-letter-to-the-denver-post/" target="_blank">serious taste</a> of <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/23/sometimes-martial-law-is-necessary/" target="_blank">martial law</a>. How many military veterans were on the receiving end of this? Is this what they signed up to fight for?</p>
<p>Stop thinking in clichés. Have a good hard look at everything your media and government tell you. This includes media outlets and parts of the government that you like. Study. Read. Ask questions. And learn that the defense of liberty is not the duty of the military. Rather, it is your duty and mine.</p>

<p style="color: #494949;">Two important recent events – Narendra Modi’s landslide victory in India last week and the massive energy and trade agreement which Russia and China signed in Beijing on Wednesday – have the potential to alter Asia’s strategic landscape.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">Modi is an assertive politician unafraid to take risks, a market-oriented reformer, but also a Hindu nationalist. When <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/modi-hindutva-will-be-an-asset-in-foreign-affairs" target="_blank">asked recently about his approach to foreign affairs</a>, he replied “I believe in Hindutva &#8230; And I am confident my Hindutva face will be an asset when dealing with foreign affairs with other nations.” In other words, he will try to increase the country’s international visibility. Already on <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/106365008340884014708/indiafebruary2008#5167695725820478018" target="_blank">my visit to India six years ago</a>, several analysts and academics unsympathetic to the Congress government expressed hope that Gujarat’s then-Chief Minister would one day lead the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bharatiya_janata_party" target="_blank">Bharatiya Janata Party</a>(BJP) instead of its ageing founder Lal Krishna Advani. As they had expected, Advani led the BJP to a defeat at the 2009 general election, but it was not until last September that Modi was finally selected as the party’s prime ministerial candidate.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">The most controversial episode in Modi’s political career concerns anti-Muslim violence which swept Gujarat at the end of February 2002, after a fire – allegedly started by Muslim arsonists – destroyed a train packed with Hindu pilgrims, killing 58 of them. The Modi government imposed a curfew in major cities and issued shoot-at-sight orders, but some human rights groups and sections of the media accused him of taking inadequate action against the riots, or even sympathizing with them.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">This episode resulted in the U.S. government denying him a visa in 2005 under a section the Immigration and Nationality Act which makes foreign government officials ineligible if they are responsible for “particularly severe violations of religious freedom.” Even after India’s Supreme Court found no such evidence against Modi, the U.S. did not lift the ban. The campaign <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk6u40qybri" target="_blank">“to get Modi”</a> was particularly virulent during Hillary Clinton’s tenure at the State, <a href="http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/obama-quietly-reverses-hillarys-get-modi-policy" target="_blank">ostensibly for the 2002 riots, but in reality</a> “for taking stands that may be different from that favored by the U.S. administration.” As an Indian <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/narendra-modi-indias-shinzo-abe" target="_blank">commentator noted on the day of the election</a>, since the Obama Administration still has not expressed regret for its revocation of his visa, “Modi is unlikely to go out of his way to befriend the U.S. by seeking a White House visit. Instead, he is expected to wait for US officials to come calling.”</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">America’s relations with India can and should improve, and for all its many sins the administration of George W. Bush cultivated and improved them during his second term. First of all, in the context of the “Pivot to Asia” Washington should give up on the notion of using India as a southern prop of the U.S.-led geopolitical ring around China. There are potential common U.S.-Indian interests in balancing China’s growing might, but India under Modi’s leadership will base its foreign policy on the old-fashioned premises of national interests, and not on the notions of “shared values” and “joint responsibilities.”</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">While Modi will not continue the <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139098/manjari-chatterjee-miller/indias-feeble-foreign-policy" target="_blank">“feeble” foreign policy of his predecessors</a>, economic development and civil service reforms are his priorities. My contacts expect that his foreign agenda will include maintaining good relations with Iran, building stronger ties with Japan, and advancing a more resolute demand for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the world’s second most populous nation; yet “the toughest job he faces is to force the Indian Foreign Service mandarins to start thinking strategically.”</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">On the whole China has been doing a better job of translating its growing economic power into political and diplomatic influence. India’s long-term strategy will require a more effective balancing act vis-à-vis China to the north and Pakistan to the West. India’s traditionally close relationship with Russia – the country’s major arms supplier – is particularly important now that Moscow and Beijing are forging what is <em>de facto</em> strategic partnership.</p>
<p style="color: #494949;">A word from Putin to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the desirability of seeking a new era of détente between Asia’s two giants could do a lot to defuse latent tensions on the Subcontinent. In Narendra Modi the nationalist, the Chinese may yet find a bolder and more imaginative partner for serious talks on the perennial border problem and other issues than in the ineffective and weak outgoing government.</p>

<p>Before Federal trolls or indoctrinated government &#8220;true believers&#8221;, starts spreading their slurs, you had better gauge the sentiment in the real America. Seventy-two percent of Americans, in a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166535/record-high-say-big-government-greatest-threat.aspx">Gallop poll</a> say big government is a greater threat to the U.S. in the future than is big business or big labor, a record high in the nearly 50-year history of this question. Yet the &#8220;so called&#8221; authorities would have you accept that only a conspiracy theorist thinks that the great protectors of law and order are capable of routing out Christians, 2nd Amendments advocates, 911 Truth proponents, Tea Party members, Patriot-Liberty groups or Global Warming deniers, and confining them to prison gulags. So when the House introduced <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr645ih/pdf/BILLS-111hr645ih.pdf">HR 645</a>, in 2009 that directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish national emergency centers on military installations, every citizen should feel threatened by its own government.</p>
<p>Here are some of those nasty facts that endanger all of us. The Albuquerque Journal account in the article, <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/390438/news/homeland-security-a-runaway-train.html">MISSION CREEP: Homeland Security a ‘runaway train’</a> should alarm everyone.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, the Department of Homeland Security is the third-largest agency in the federal government, behind only the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense.</p>
<p>When created in 2002, DHS merged 22 pre-existing federal agencies into one, marking the largest reorganization of the federal government in more than 50 years. Among the agencies included under the Homeland Security umbrella are the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>In the first year of its existence, the Department of Homeland Security employed 180,000 full-time workers. Today, 240,000 people collect paychecks from the agency, according to its website.</p>
<p>The department&#8217;s budget has more than doubled since the agency&#8217;s inception in 2003, when it spent $29 billion. This year, DHS is slated to spend $61 billion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/ReEmergence-of-FEMA.jpg.w300h196.jpg" alt="ReEmergence-of-FEMA.jpg" width="300" align="Right" /><br />
Beginning at its inception, Homeland Security had all the telltale indications that a militarized national interment force was designed to segregate, if not bury, domestic ‘enemies of the state&#8221;.</p>
<p>From the executive summary, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-fema-camps/7763">US FEMA Camps</a> published by the Geopolitical Monitor states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In August 2002, then Attorney General John Ashcroft called for American citizens who are deemed &#8216;enemy combatants&#8217; to be detained indefinitely without charge and independently of the judiciary. This legal position was upheld in the case of a US citizen detained abroad by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a January 2003 ruling.</p>
<p>For some time FEMA has been renovating and constructing new detention camps throughout the country. In January 2006 Haliburton subsidiary KBR announced that it had been awarded an &#8220;indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contract to construct detention facilities for the Department of Homeland Security worth a maximum of $385 million over 5 years.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Stated Purpose</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Little has been said about the purpose of the detainment camps but when official comment has been made it has stated that the camps are for the temporary detainment of illegal immigrants.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>PLEASE, if that objective was true, how does one explain away the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/05/15/Valerie-Jarrett-We-Have-a-Commitment-from-Boehner-to-Try-to-Pass-Amnesty">Breitbart</a> reporting that &#8216;We Have a Commitment&#8217; From Boehner on Amnesty This Year? At the same time, the Obama administration demonstrates that their own <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/14/immigration-releases-convicted-felons/9090557/">Government released hundreds of immigrant felons</a>. Only a fool would believe that this FEMA fairy tale yarn about their detention facilities. Dave Hodges of <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2014/05/16/these-men-are-training-to-put-you-and-your-family-in-a-fema-camp/">The Common Sense Show</a> always reveals the true unpleasant details that most Americans are afraid to confront. In his article, <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/11/12/cbs-news-admits-fema-camps-are-real/">CBS News Admits FEMA Camps Are Real</a>, a leaked <a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/07/31/you-can-lead-a-sheep-to-knowledge-but-you-cant-make-them-think/">memo</a> from KBR manager, Bob Siefert, referenced a disturbing call for the installation of fencing and wire used for large-scale detention of prisoners.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Subcontractors will mobilize, transport, erect, install and demobilize temporary fencing, barricades, and associated equipment according to federal, state and local laws, codes and manufacturer installation instructions. The Subcontractor shall be able to mobilize and deploy key personnel(s) within four (4) hours of NTP to meet with KBR Site Manager at the Responder Support Camp (RSC) site in order to finalize the site design plan and acquire site-specific design requirements and layout. Number of linear footage:</p>
<p>&#8220;Approximately 2,300LF for a 301 person camp after 36 hours of NTP&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Approximately 3,600LF for 1,000 person camp after 72 hours of NTP&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds like FEMA camp activation to me and it closely parallels the FEMA camp events on the East Coast in the aftermath of Sandy.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>Since so many apolitical mentally challenged flag wavers, accept the myth that <a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/081813.html">I&#8217;m From The Government and Here To Help</a>, even in the face of stark reality, the only rational conclusion is to expect the worst. The Nolan Chart features an essay by Walt Gelles, <a href="http://www.nolanchart.com/article10577-time-to-abolish-the-fema-camps-html">Time To Abolish The FEMA Camps</a>, that succinctly makes the case for questioning the true purpose of Homeland Security constructed FEMA internment camps.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The FEMA camps are ready… Eight hundred empty secret prisons, detention centers, concentration camps scattered around the U.S.A.-fully operational, surrounded by full-time armed guards, and ready to receive prisoners.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s Homeland Security Department bought 1.6 billion bullets using your taxpayer dollars. That&#8217;s five bullets for every man, woman, and child…five bullets waiting to pierce your skull…hollow-point bullets, sniper bullets, forbidden under international law for use in war. Plus 2,700 military tanks for domestic use, and Obama has created a para-military police force operating under Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Do you think those 1.6 billion bullets were intended for a bunch of Arab terrorists trying to take over a Walmart or an airport? Think again. Do you really believe the FEMA camps were built to house Muslim fanatics or flood victims? Get real. Go ask Hillary Clinton what the FEMA camps are for. Go ask Nancy Pelosi or John Boehner or President Obama/Soetoro. You&#8217;re paying billions of dollars for the government to put you away.</p>
<p>Most of the 800 FEMA camps can house up to 20,000 prisoners. That works out to 15 million Americans the government is ready to lock up. All the camps have railroad facilities, and the boxcars have been built to transport the prisoners. Sounds like Auschwitz? The cars have shackles welded in; plastic coffins are stockpiled and ready for use.</p>
<p>What if enough people found out that the 9/11 &#8220;terrorist&#8221; attack was no terrorist attack at all, but a false-flag event carried out by the U.S. Government to serve as a pretext to invade Iraq and Afghanistan and to install the Surveillance State at home? And what if millions of people demanded that the real perpetrators, the real 9/11 mass murderers-in the White House, the CIA, the Pentagon, the judiciary-be brought to justice in a Nuremberg-style criminal court?</p>
<p>The FEMA camps are ready. To put the movement&#8217;s leaders away. To crush the dissent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What portion of this explanation is incorrect? Refusal to face up to the actions of DHS will not necessarily save you from selection for a place at a FEMA camp. The transition of Americans from thinking defenders of constitutional liberties into dumb down nationalists and servile obedient slaves, explained in the essay, <a href="http://www.batr.org/wrack/042813.html">From Viet Nam Defiance to Boston Surrender</a>, needs a response to a fundamental question. Will you allow forcible transport to a FEMA camp? Or will you gladly pack up your toothbrush and submit to &#8220;<a href="http://www.november.org/stayinfo/breaking2/Ferranti.html">Diesel Therapy</a>&#8221; and ride the bus to your new cell?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Corrosive incrementalism of totalitarian policies developed in an environment of gradual apathy, over the last half century. Dissenting opposition movements, persistently confrontational against the establishment became less organized and vocal. As a result, institutions of influence descended into deeper depths of moral corruption, as the agencies of bureaucratic dominance expanded their reach and scope of tyranny.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The prospects of declaring martial law, as well as, federal direction of coercive compliance and assimilation of local law enforcement assets, is the only logical purpose of creating militarized FEMA encampments. In a country, that maintains <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/033113.html">Private Prisons and the Enslavement Society</a>, it is one small step to eliminate any opposition by way of herding defiant resistors into secure concentration camps.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/change-hitler-obama-lenin-300.jpg" alt="change-hitler-obama-lenin-300.jpg" align="Left"/></p>
<p>Those who still say it could never happen in the United States, lack a historic perspective and current events understanding. Ever since the exploited <a href="http://batr.org/wrack/011104.html">ultimate excuse</a> of the <a href="http://batr.org/911/">911</a> false flag, the nation has suffered from acute delusional disorder syndrome. With the announcement that the <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/911-Museum-NYC-Ground-Zero-Dedication-Ceremony-WTC-Museum-259264311.html">9/11 Museum Opens to Families, First Responders With Emotional Dedication Ceremony</a>, you witness another psychological warfare opportunity to pave the way for the latest tactic of indoctrinating the public into accepting that domestic terrorists are the new focus of the Homeland Security mission.</p>
<p>Under both Bush and Obama, the authoritarians have built the greatest threat to America; namely, a permanent police state. Depending upon the FEMA district in which you reside, the presence of Federal concertina wire may vary. However, the <a href="http://www.rense.com/general58/fearthecomingtrain.htm">rail cars</a> are able to move human cargo in all directions and the trains will run on time. Check out the <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/find-the-fema-camp-nearest-you_062013">FEMA camp</a> closest to you.</p>
<p>With the adoption of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/tag/NDAA">National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)</a>, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/senators-demand-military-lock-american-citizens-battlefield-they-define-being">codifying indefinite military detention</a> without charge or trial into law, places at risk every American in the torture chamber of the Gitmo captivity culture. Before long, the next fabricated crisis offers the opportunity for Martial Law that translates into the order for the knock at your door. Will you accept DHS chains? Or will you die, a bona fide American hero and resist?</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Leave it to The Gay Lady to be a day late and a few brain cells short. <span style="font-style: italic;">The New York Times</span> recently published an article by some journalism-school retread about the Cliven Bundy situation, a piece containing all the usual talking points about how the “racist” rancher’s reasoning is really risible. Rinse, wash and repeat. What interests me right now are not the facts of the case, however, but one particular line in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> commentary.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The sentence is a quotation from ex-superintendent of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area Alan O’Neill, a line that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> writer, a Mr. Adam Nagourney, obviously felt was so powerful and profound that it warranted closing his piece with. Here’s the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?hp&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">passage</a> containing the line:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">“He [Bundy] calls himself a patriot, and says he loves America,” Mr. O’Neill said. “And yet he says he won’t follow any federal laws. You just can’t let this go by, or everybody is going to be like, ‘If Bundy can break the law, why can’t I?’”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Wow, an example of not following the law. Shocking! Unprecedented! A threat to the republic!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">All I can say about Nagourney is that, for sure, one of us has taken the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill" target="_blank">blue pill</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Has it escaped the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times’</span> notice that the feds have been found wanting in the enforcement of immigration law for decades and that Barack Obama has basically cast enforcement to the winds? Has the paper ever heard of sanctuary cities? Have its editors gotten the memo about rule by executive order and Obama’s suspension of ObamaCare provisions he finds politically inconvenient? Have they noticed that Uncle Scam has been violating the Constitution — the supreme law of the land — for nigh on 100 years and that Obama wipes his feet on it?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"> Gay Lady, I hereby re-christen thee <span style="font-style: italic;">The Blue Pill Times</span>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The BPT is certainly right in assuming that unanswered lawbreaking makes people conclude, “If ______ can break the law, why can’t I?” But it isn’t “Bundy” that fills in that blank.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In point of fact, the reason we had troves of people rallying to Bundy’s side is the same reason why we’re seeing state nullification movements pushing back against ObamaCare, federal gun-control law and other central-government measures:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The blatant and criminal disregard the feds have shown for the Constitution — the contract the American people have with one another — and the feds’ continual overstepping of their bounds and aggregation of power, have caused people to say, “If the feds can break the law, why can’t I?”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It has further made citizens realize that they have a right and a duty to oppose federal law. Why a right? Well, if a party subject to a contract consistently and obstinately violates the contract’s terms for the purposes of advantaging itself and undermining the other parties subject to the contract, are the latter still bound by the now broken agreement?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is rendered <span style="font-style: italic;">null and void</span>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As for duty, to sit idly by while the feds violate the contract and trample rights makes one complicit in the crime, an accessory perhaps before, and certainly during and after, the fact.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This, mind you, is the main reason I side with Cliven Bundy. The particulars of the case are irrelevant because the feds long ago demonstrated their ill will and illegitimacy. As for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Blue Pill Times</span>, it’s great it has discovered the value of the rule of law. Now all it need do is reveal what entity truly undermined it and the manifold ways in which it has been done. Of course, this would mean actually presenting, for the first time, “All the News That&#8217;s Fit to Print.”</p>

<p>We are witnessing, I believe, a turning point in geopolitical history, one future historians may analyze as we have the Roman Empire’s fall. Vladimir Putin is making a move — and it’s not just against Ukraine. It may not be just a move against Eastern Europe. It’s not even, perhaps, just a move against US world dominance.</p>
<p>There was a time when the USSR was the “evil empire, a godless Golgotha. But that was then. Now, in 2013-14, Putin has seen fit to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/28/whos-godless-now-russia-says-its-us/?page=1">say</a>, in his December State of the Nation speech, “Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values. …Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation.”</p>
<p>This roughly coincided with Russia’s enactment of laws prohibiting homosexual propaganda and was a salvo against both the West’s Great Sexual Heresy and what enables it: moral relativism.</p>
<p>In another shot at relativism, Putin averred, “Society is now required…to accept without question the equality of good and evil, strange as it seems, concepts that are opposite in meaning.”</p>
<p>The Russian president then took aim at multiculturalism: “Today, many nations are revising their moral values and ethical norms, eroding ethnic traditions and differences between peoples and cultures.”</p>
<p>And now we’re seeing the release of Russian Culture War 2.0. In a document called &#8220;Foundations of the State Cultural Policy,&#8221; the Kremlin is doubling down and<a href="http://articles.mcall.com/2014-04-04/opinion/mc-russia-putin-west-web-20140404_1_leonid-bershidsky-ivanov-russia"> writes</a>, &#8220;Russia must be viewed as a unique and original civilization that cannot be reduced to &#8216;East&#8217; or &#8216;West.&#8217; …A concise way of formulating this stand would be, ‘Russia is not Europe.’” The document goes on to state that Russia rejects “such principles as multiculturalism and tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;projects imposing alien values on society.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, this is not your grandfather’s Russia.</p>
<p>But it very well may be your great-grandfather’s.</p>
<p>There are a few different things, I suspect, going on here. The 20 years after the Cold War’s end had been a period of <em>relative</em> co-operation between Russia and the West, but you can’t define yourself by going along (to get along) with the world’s cultural hegemon; you can’t be band leader by playing second fiddle. So Putin is defining his nation as the un-morally-wild West. In addition, he knows that to rally a people behind you, you need a boogeyman, your Eurasia, the “Nappy” (Napoleon) who will “get you,” British children, if you’re not good.</p>
<p>Yet it isn’t just that Putin is restarting the Cold War. Nor is he just an old-line KGB Bolshevik, as some stuck in commentary amber have suggested. He’s smart enough to realize that Marxism is, as the kids today would say, just so “played.”</p>
<p>He more likely wants to be the next czar.</p>
<p>What’s my theory? Try this on for size: It isn’t just that Putin wants to restore lost Russian glory.</p>
<p>He sees a chance to be a historic figure.</p>
<p>Note here that you don’t have to be good to be historic; Roman statesman Cicero called Julius Caesar an “ambitious villain,” but Caesar’s name is far better known than Cicero’s. And let’s consider what might be Putin’s calculation: the West has long been the world’s cultural trend-setter, spreading an increasingly un-Christian creed to all corners of the Earth. Of course, not everyone is on board. The Islamic abode wants nothing to do with it, but it’s Muslim; sub-Saharan Africa is largely opposed, but it lacks clout. As for South America, in addition to lacking clout it’s confused; and while China is gaining power, it’s largely pagan and non-committal on the culture war.</p>
<p>Enter the second Vladimir the Great.</p>
<p>Putin doesn’t just see a chance to define himself — and to unite the Russian people behind him — via opposition to the West, as his Marxist comrades once did.</p>
<p>He sees a chance to do it as today’s Charlemagne.</p>
<p>There’s an unsatisfied market for Christendom’s standard bearer, and Putin perceives an opportunity to exploit it. China won’t do it, Africa can’t, South America wouldn’t and couldn’t. But just as the original Vladimir the Great Christianized the Kievan Rus&#8217;, just as Charlemagne forged and helped Christianize modern Europe, Putin has a chance to lift the cross — and himself — high.</p>
<p>And the West is a gift that keeps on giving insofar as this goes. Our cultural Marxists are on the march, smell blood and will not stop. They will continue spending us into insolvency, perverting us into prone position, relativizing us into risibility and “immigrationizing” us into irrelevance. Even now, not satisfied with placing another great nail in marriage’s coffin, our militant secularists are making moves to<a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2013/09/the-slippery-slope-to-pedophilia.html"> legitimize pedophilia</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2352779/Bestiality-brothels-spreading-Germany-campaigner-claims-abusers-sex-animals-lifestyle-choice.html">bestiality</a>. It’s onward Luciferian soldiers.</p>
<p>And for Putin, it’s onward Christian soldier. As our degradation advances, Russia’s star can rise commensurately. Putin knows the West is in decline. He sees the demographic trends, that the US is transforming into a Third World/Hispanic nation and Western Europe into a Third World/Muslim continent. He knows that if there is another superpower in the near future, it will be Russia or China. And he knows what card he has to play to win this game.</p>
<p>Of course, while we could argue about whether the Christian-soldier solution is tactic and strategy or just tactic, it is so obviously prudent that it’s inconceivable Putin wouldn’t have pursued it. Just consider the benefits, starting with justification of Russian expansionism. If you’re a typical Russian, might not the idea that “the West is decadent, debauched, exhausted and effete” justify, in your mind, a Russian manifest destiny? Might it not be natural and wholly in accordance with man’s nature to believe that your moral superiority gives you the right to dominate? Note that this is the theory that helped justify the colonial powers’ imperialism: they were bringing civilization to a world of darkness. And it’s what we do to this day, applying secular values as standard. How often have we heard intervention in the Islamic “stan” du jour justified by pointing out that its rulers oppress women and are intolerant? The judgments are different, but the desire to claim the moral high ground is the same.</p>
<p>Then consider foreign relations. The USSR used to jockey for world influence with us; whereas before they had to market Marxism, however, now they can peddle purity. Standing against decadent Western secular-imperialism can win Russia many friends in Africa and even the Middle East, and most of the Far East will go with the dominant power.</p>
<p>Lastly, even if Putin is a functional atheist — even if his road to Heaven is paved with bad intentions — he surely knows that if Russia wants to prosper, Western secular/hedonist isms must be rejected. And why wouldn’t he know? As Soviet defector Yuri Bezmenov and others have<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJKJM36lMTE"> explained</a>, it was his erstwhile Marxist buddies who encouraged those movements in the West for the purposes of undermining our civilization.</p>
<p>But we’re doing a very good job of undermining it ourselves, and Putin is more concerned with building his own. Pat Buchanan recently <a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/pat-buchanan/whose-side-is-god-on-now.html">wrote</a> about this and pointed out that Putin may very well view his realm as “The Third Rome:”</p>
<p>The first Rome was the Holy City and seat of Christianity that fell to Odoacer and his barbarians in 476 A.D. The second Rome was Constantinople, Byzantium, (today&#8217;s Istanbul), which fell to the Turks in 1453. The successor city to Byzantium, the Third Rome, the last Rome to the old believers, was — Moscow.</p>
<p>Putin is entering a claim that Moscow is the Godly City of today and command post of the counter-reformation against the new paganism.</p>
<p>…Putin is saying the new ideological struggle is between a debauched West led by the United States and a traditionalist world Russia would be proud to lead.</p>
<p>Note here that the term “czar” is derived from the Latin word <em>Caesar</em>. And while Putin may be just as satisfied to be Julius or Augustus as Constantine, I’m quite sure that Marxism is no longer his bag. That would be playing second fiddle again — and the last thing the Russians want to be is like us.</p>

			<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/racist.jpg" alt="" />For the last half century, the American population, subjected to the greatest dumbing down experiment of psychological manipulation in all of history, has resulted in the adoption of a cultural separation from realty and true self-interest. With all the glorious aspirations, that celebrate a diverse society, the fact that humankind shares the same planet usually is not enough to resolve disparities. While DNA <a href="http://batr.org/archives/part2.html">similarities</a> are the basis of the specie, the genetic differences among races, put aside and banished from polite conversation, still are true and significant. Yet the civilizations that make up this world function as if the tribal differences are often paramount in the social order.The intentional indoctrination that all races are equal rests upon a specious supposition that the goals, objectives and ambitions assign a uniform desire. Once upon a time immigration to the New World came from a European heritage. That influx of settlers provided a similar experience if not an identical cultural attitude. With the introduction of the slave trade economy, the forced transplanting of African captives, initiated a road to social dissolution as demonstrated in today’s racial conflicts.</p>
<p>The notion that this country is a harmonious society fails because of a very basic element that few people will admit. Blacks, Caucasians, Oriental, Native Americans and any combination of mixed races all have an opportunity to interact and grow in moral character and intellectual honesty as the sins of the past are put to rest, in the reciprocal objective of creating a mature society based upon mutual respect.</p>
<p>However, respect needs to be earned and is not an intrinsic ingredient automatically granted to every cultural social mind-set.</p>
<p>Individuals have the ability to make choices. Choosing civilization over barbarianism is within the grasps of any sincere and ethically committed person.</p>
<p>This object of civilized unity builds a future for the greatest numbers. Recognizing that deliberate induced racial animosity has a profound political purpose is essential to understand the motives behind distorted news reporting and the progressive policy agenda that seeks to conquer by dividing the different factions, which populate the country.</p>
<p>Reformist activism, usually portrayed as shaping government programs that provide for &#8220;so called&#8221; well-intentioned coercive laws and regulations, is the media narrative that insults the intelligence of any thinking person.</p>

No better example of this televised psychosomatic pollution that inflicts a national disease of artificial guilt is MSNBC. The notorious medicine-man dispenser of this kind of poison is <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1816884/posts">Al Sharpton</a>. The Reverend has a long record of demeaning his own brothers and sisters by bring new meaning to the term, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffir_(racial_term)">Kaffir</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/07/report-sharpton-invokes-race-215-times-on-his-show-in-2013/">The Daily Caller</a>, political reporter Caroline May cites Sharpton’s consistent race baiting tirades.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;MSNBC host Reverend Al Sharpton invoked race over 200 times last year, <a href="http://www.mrc.org/articles/racy-rev-msnbcs-sharpton-mentions-race-215-times-13">according to a new tally</a> by the conservative Media Research Center.</p>
<p>According to the analysis by Katie Yoder the liberal host said &#8220;race,&#8221; &#8220;racism,&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221; 215 times in 2013 during his MSNBC show PoliticsNation.</p>
<p>&#8220;From opposition to the Obama agenda to guns and even into fashion and food, Sharpton’s finely tuned nose for racism rarely took a day off last year,&#8221; Yoder wrote.</p>
<p>In an example the MRC notes that Sharpton was able to invoke race five times in a single paragraph about Republican attacks on Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in January, John Daly on <a href="http://www.bernardgoldberg.com/">bernardgoldberg.com</a>, publishes the account, <a href="http://www.bernardgoldberg.com/msnbc-twitterer-fired/">MSNBC Twitterer Fired for Race Baiting</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On Wednesday night, conservatives honed in on offensive tweet that appeared on MSNBC’s official Twitter feed. The full tweet read, &#8220;Maybe the rightwing will hate it, but everyone else will go awww: the adorable new #Cheerios ad w/biracial family.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The comment was in reference a new television commercial for Cheerios entitled &#8220;Gracie&#8221; that features a biracial family enjoying a breakfast conversation at their kitchen table. The implication by the MSNBC employee behind the tweet, of course, was that the rightwing in this country is racist, and therefore they would surely be disgusted by the visual scene of a family with one white parent and one black parent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of the story included that other mainstay of race politics and self-reproach apologist, Chris Mathews. The Hardball <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/18/chris_matthews_to_black_msnbc_employee_on_race_im_speaking_now_for_all_white_people_im_sorry.html/looid=NlZTRmZDrkzdU7qFfooL0uqE2HK8UJn-">video</a>, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/07/18/chris_matthews_to_black_msnbc_employee_on_race_im_speaking_now_for_all_white_people_im_sorry.html">Matthews To Black Guest On Race</a>: &#8220;I&#8217;m Speaking Now For All White People&#8230; I&#8217;m Sorry&#8221;, is a pitiful testimony.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We got to continue this conversation, gentlemen, privately and on television. I mean a lot of people out there &#8212; I&#8217;ll just tell you one thing. And I&#8217;m speaking now for all white people, but especially people who have had to try to change the last 50 or 60 years. And they &#8212; a lot of them have really tried to change, and I&#8217;m sorry for this stuff. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="chrismatthews.jpg" src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/chrismatthews.jpg" align="Left" /><br />
Tom Borelli, writes in the Liberty Alliance - <a href="http://libertyalliance.com/2013/11/msnbc-chris-matthews-wild-race-card-attack-conservatives/">MSNBC Chris Matthews Wild Race Card Attack Against Conservatives</a>, more from this self-anointed supporter and barker for liberal delusional bigotry.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In his foaming rant, Matthews claims voter I.D. laws are like poll taxes with the goal to suppress black voters and he adds Obama’s political opposition are the enemy that gain from hate:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Obama’s true enemies are those who back the three dozen states now pushing voter suppression laws to make damn sure the country doesn’t go and elect another black president, or a progressive white president. You know this generation’s equivalent of poll taxes and those discredited literacy tests anything to keep minorities from their voting rights. And to this crowd the Obama haters add to them those who gnaw on the president’s health care bill with the hunger of starving rats but offer nothing in its place except their crazed notions about bringing down the government and destroying the county’s economic stature even as they deny even a penny of credit to the president for the zooming American stock market right now. These are the enemies those who stand and benefit from all the anger and hatred and indecency of the nasty right…&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Matthews is once again proving MSNBC is not a news organization but a cable outlet for political operatives whose goal is to spread progressive propaganda.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So does this party line programming, emphasizing a racially slanted mantra, which drives wedges among the viewing public, actually help ratings? The <a href="https://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/nov-2013-ratings-chris-matthews-is-tops-for-msnbc_b205172">TVNewser</a> lists that MSNBC was down across the board compared to Nov. 2012. However, MSNBC ranked #1 among African-American viewers in both A25-54 and total viewers in all key dayparts and MSNBC ranked #1 among Hispanic viewers A25-54 in M-F primetime and M-Su primetime.<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/monday-cable-news-ratings-sharpton-1-in-demo-on-msnbc/">Mediaite</a> lists Sharpton #1 in Demo on MSNBC. Especially review the chart TV NEWS RATINGS: 25-54 DEMOGRAPHIC comparing with the other cable news networks.</p>
<blockquote><p>PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton was the highest-rated show in the 25-54 demo across MSNBC’s evening schedule Monday with 214K viewers. Sharpton beat fellow MSNBC hosts Chris Matthews, who had 209K viewers and Ed Schultz, who had 170K.</p>
<p>Matthews was #1 in total viewers on MSNBC with 844K, followed by Rachel Maddow with 729K and Schultz with 717K.</p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/03/18/pew-study-finds-msnbc-the-most-opinionated-cable-news-channel-by-far/">Pew Study Finds MSNBC the Most Opinionated Cable News Channel By Far</a>, &#8220;A full 85% of the Comcast-owned network’s coverage can be classified as opinion or commentary rather than straight news, according to the authors of the Pew Research Center’s annual State of the News Media report.&#8221;</p>
<p>The significance of this data is that the gap between minority identified and 25-54 viewers and all America is increasing even wider. With the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/02/2013-cable-news-ratings-msnbc-cnn_n_4532020.html">2013 Cable News Ratings</a>: Fox News Sees Sharp Demo Decline, CNN Suffers In Primetime. The race baiters at MSNBC seems to have consolidated their niche among targeted minorities and the products of the more recent government school educated and MTV generation.Decades of liberalizing news distortion and manufactured false re-invention of history has produced a total disconnect from reality. MSNBC is used as a poster boy network for shutting out serious journalism from the medium, but it is almost impossible to find any mainstream broadcasts that are worthy of viewership.</p>
<p>There is a profound reason why the stuck on stupid culture is all around us. Open and rational political debate and discourse is slated for complete removal from television. Anyone who can seriously admit being a MSNBC viewer has deep seeded issues of reckoning sane behavior.</p>
<p>Those limousine liberals love to champion abortion as a well-tested solution of reducing population. Minorities, particularly targeted for marginalization, need to rebel against the democratic politicians and liberal class perversion, whereby <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/nyc-more-black-babies-killed-abortion-born">NYC: More Black Babies Killed by Abortion Than Born</a>. For those who gain a foothold on life, the media brainwashing of the likes of Rev. Al await.Fools who drink from the cup of their own racial genocide are their own worst enemy. The national interest demands that exploitation of race as a substitute for intelligent co-existence end. Compulsory Integration or miscegenation leveling has proven a massive failure. Is it not time that all tribes start a respectful dialogue and abandon the shackles of blaming race discrimination for the general failure of society? Separation by race is natural. This fact is a news topic that serious media and journalists need to address.</p>

<p>How would you feel if a police officer you knew for 20 years told you that if an order was issued to confiscate your guns, he wouldn’t hesitate to “kick your door in”? This was the precisely the experience Connecticut resident, Navy veteran and former firefighter John Cinque had after commenting on his state’s 2013 violation of the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>The law in question criminalizes the sale of magazines holding more than 10 rounds and also certain semi-automatic rifles, and mandates that all grandfathered weapons and magazines must be registered with the state. As for Cinque and the exchange with his “old friend” — Branford Police Officer Joseph Peterson — which occurred on Facebook, Mikael Thalen at Infowars.com <a href="http://www.infowars.com/conn-cop-i-will-kick-down-doors-to-confiscate-guns/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’ve had contact with a police officer in my home town, I live in Branford, and his words straight out were, ‘I cannot wait to get the order to kick your door in,’” Cinque said.</p>
<p>…In multiple [Facebook] screenshots captured from the lengthy conversation, Peterson continually argued that law enforcement were not obligated to defy unconstitutional laws. Instead, Peterson stated that he would follow any order given, even if it meant confiscating firearms from close friends.</p></blockquote>
<p>And to a poster named Cameron Smith, Peterson said, “I give my left n** to bang down your door and come for your gun.”</p>
<p>Of course, the conversation had become heated, causing Peterson to perhaps speak a bit more rashly than he would otherwise. And I’m well aware of the “good soldier” cop argument stating that theirs is not to wonder why, theirs is but to do or die (even if it kills constitutional rights). Hey, “I don’t make the laws,” says the dutiful constable, “I just enforce them.” But there’s a problem with this position. And this is why I want to give you, my friends in law enforcement, the reasoned, moral argument for “policeman nullification.”</p>
<p>Even good people can live lives of contradiction and entertain ideas that simply aren’t true. For instance, if you’re a cop, it’s easy to justify an action by saying that your job is only to enforce the law, especially since, on paper, this is certainly so. But the implication that you enforce every law, across the board, every time, without discretion is absolutely untrue and you, I and everyone else knows it. You don’t ticket everyone driving 31 in a 30 zone, and many times even more egregious law-breakers get off with a warning. Some laws aren’t applied at all, such as a parking law in my town an officer told me was on the books but that “we don’t enforce.” You use discretion all the time.</p>
<p>As for legislation such as Connecticut’s new gun restrictions, ask yourself this question, guys: If I caught my brother, sister, father, mother, son or daughter with some legally acquired but now illegal 30-round magazines in his car trunk, would I slap him in cuffs, haul him in and put him in the system? Let’s face it, you know the answer. And, well, the person you would haul in and arrest for this newly minted “crime” would be someone else’s brother, sister, father, mother, son or daughter. Of course, this argument could justify refusal to enforce most any law, since family will virtually always receive special treatment. So is there a sound rationale for refusing to enforce a law across the board?</p>
<p>Any sane person agrees that no one can simply follow orders blindly, that, at some point, a command itself can become criminal in the moral sense. For instance, would you enforce a law stating that all members of a certain racial or ethnic group were to be rounded up for extermination? Yes, this is an extreme example, and I don’t pretend that the new Second Amendment violations even approach such wickedness. The point, however, is that everyone draws a line — it’s just a question of where. And I’d certainly hope that you, my friends in law enforcement, would take a stand somewhere below genocide.</p>
<p>So what should inform how you draw your line today? Bear in mind that we have an increasingly lawless government and bureaucracy that make less and less pretense about upholding the law. Invaders from foreign nations violate our borders with relative impunity, as our federal executive branch agitates for amnesty and sues states that clamp down on illegal migrants. These are the same feds, by the way, who also sue states that enact voter ID laws, even as the White House last year touted a $53 million (your tax money) <a href="https://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/wh-touts-kenyan-program-obtain-national-id-cards-voter-registration_737990.html">program</a> to facilitate voter ID in Kenya.</p>
<p>In that executive branch we have a president who, after swearing to faithfully uphold the laws of the land, often rules by executive decree, ignoring laws he finds politically inconvenient. Most outrageously — after using manipulation and machinations to pass ObamaCare — Barack Obama has continually made unilateral decisions to delay provisions of it that could hurt his party’s electoral fortunes. So serious is his constitutional trespass that even liberal law professor Jonathan Turley <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/commentary/la-oe-turley-obama-separation-of-powers-20140309,0,5262266.story#axzz2vacINoXa">warned</a> that Obama was helping to create an “uber presidency” that posed a “danger” to our republic.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, states and localities don’t have clean hands, either, with some having a history of refusing to enforce drug and immigration laws. Of course, federal drug laws aren’t constitutional in the first place, which brings me to my final point.</p>
<p>In a nation where man’s law is becoming lawless, how do you decide whether or not to obey/enforce a given law? We clearly can’t operate by whim, even though many laws today are made or enforced based on whim. Obviously, we should be informed by the Constitution, but a similar question then arises: can everyone just decide for himself what is constitutional? It’s that age-old dilemma.</p>
<p>The answer is that unless we are connected to that unchanging law — the highest law — and have uncorrupted judgment and a well-formed moral compass, all is for naught.</p>
<p>And considering these factors, what can we say about the Connecticut anti-Second Amendment law? You likely know it will do nothing to reduce crime and at best was crafted with criminal disregard for rights and facts and at worst was made just to score political points. And do you really want to mindlessly enforce laws — like a Terminator obeying programming — born of lawless legislators’ caprice?</p>
<p>Were I a Connecticut policeman, it would be a cold day in the halls of government before I’d ever enforce the new gun-control laws. If the IRS can get away with an “oops” for targeting conservative groups, so can citizens targeted by an unjust law.</p>
<p>As to this, I’ll leave you with the words of St. Augustine: “An unjust law is no law at all.”</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>
<p>The Cameron Smith quoted in my article wrote to me and reported the following (edited for punctuation):</p>
<blockquote><p>Just wanted to thank you for the very fair article on the Police officer in CT. While yes, the conversation got very heated, once he [Officer Joseph Peterson] was seen as a cop, he should have stepped WAY back. A lot of news articles are putting my quote in of me saying he would put Jews in Ghettos as the reason he went off. He actually went off well before that. I literally asked him if a law was passed to put Jews in the Ghettos, would you?  He literally said, &#8220;Now you are being silly&#8230;but if it’s the law, I enforce it; I don&#8217;t make them.&#8221;</p>
<p>To me THAT was the quote of the story that everyone is missing.</p></blockquote>
