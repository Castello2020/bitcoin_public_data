<p>Sometimes I just want to pimp slap people.</p>
<p>Last summer, I was at dinner during a sales convention. The conversation didn’t get political until someone mentioned the NSA.</p>
<p>There is one in every crowd. Someone piped up and said, “They can spy on me all they want. I am not doing anything wrong.”</p>
<p>They sang this song in Germany in 1933. And they sang it with unprecedented gusto in the months following 9/11, all in the name of  “security” and “keeping us safe”.</p>
<p>We were at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, the world’s second largest hotel. Nothing in the post-9/11 “national security” apparatus would prevent a terrorist from walking in, setting off a bomb, and killing hundreds or even thousands of people.</p>
<p>The more important questions are: How do you know you are doing nothing that could be construed as wrong by some state functionary? How do you know you are not breaking some law somewhere? And why are you so implicitly trusting that your government would never do anything evil with the information it has collected on you?</p>
<p>This is not purely an academic matter. The practical implications are profound.</p>
<p>I give you several examples.</p>
<p>1. Niakea Williams went to her son’s St. Louis-area elementary school one day to pick up her son, who has Asperger’s. The school was put on lockdown and <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Mother-arrested-at-school-for-consoling-son-in-local-classroom-251349481.html">Mrs. Williams was escorted out in handcuffs.</a></p>

<p>7. Norman Gurley was arrested in Lorain County, Ohio, because a compartment in his car <a href="http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/2013/11/20/trap-car-law/3655713/">could have been used to transport drugs.</a></p>

As a result, the DEA placed his house <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/28/mans-good-deed-lands-his-home-on-dea-list-meth-labs/?intcmp=latestnews">on its list of meth labs.</a></p>
<p>10. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Holle">Ryan Holle</a> of Pensacola, Florida, lent his roommate his car on night in 2004. As a result, Holle is currently serving a <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/lending-friend-your-car-can-get-you-life-sentence?page=0%2C0&amp;paging=off&amp;current_page=1#bookmark">life sentence without possibility of parole</a> for pre-meditated murder.</p>
<p>11. New York police seized Gerald Bryan’s cash in a nighttime raid in 2012. <a href="http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/nypd-seized-innocent-mans-cash-used-pad-pensions/#axzz2qOoePUCS">Even though Bryan was cleared of any wrongdoing</a>, the stolen cash was deposited in the NYPD pension fund.</p>

<p>15. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/12/health/medical-marijuana-parents/index.html?hpt=hp_t3">Look what happened</a> to these parents in Napa, California, even though the medical marijuana prescriptions they had were completely legal.</p>
<p>16. Eileen Ann Bower of suburban Pittsburgh <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/03/17/county-settles-with-mother-who-lost-newborn-after-erroneous-drug-test/">had her newborn child taken from her for 75 days</a> because of a false positive drug test.</p>

<p>20. This San Diego couple was <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/cop-types-wrong-license-plate-number-nightmare-innocent-couple/">pepper-sprayed and tasered</a> by police who had erroneously identified their vehicle after being stolen.</p>
<p>21. The good news is that Brian Aitken of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/brian-aitken-jersey-gun-charge-commuted-gov-chris/story?id=12448867">had his prison sentence commuted.</a>The bad news is that he was originally sentenced to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/14/Possessing-Legally-Purchased-Guns-In-New-Jersey-Cost-Brian-Aitken-Everything">seven years behind bars</a> for possessing two legally purchased guns.</p>

As someone put it on Facebook, “Don’t call the cops. Ever. Even if you find a dead body. Just don’t ever call the cops.”</p>
<p>26. Read what happened to Diane Avera of Meridian, Mississippi, when she went to Alabama to buy Sudafed, <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/predators-of-marengo-county.html">even though she did not know</a> that this was illegal.</p>

<p>These are not “isolated incidents.” There are no doubt countless other examples of people who were doing nothing wrong, yet were harshly punished.</p>
<p>Also, consider the following:</p>
<p>• The Internal Revenue Code is <a href="http://www.cch.com/wbot2013/factsheet.pdf">73,955 pages</a> and millions of words long. No one has read it cover-to-cover and no one knows every aspect of it. Yet if anyone violates any of its provisions it can mean fines, prison or even death.</p>
<p>• We are often told that “ignorance of the law is no defense.” To the right is a picture of the Yale Law Library. Do you know every law contained within these tomes?</p>

</ul>
<p>• Seventy-two types of Americans are <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/72-types-of-americans-that-are.html">classified as terrorists</a> in various government documents.

<p><em>&#8220;The grimmest dictatorship is the dictatorship of the prevailing orthodoxy&#8221; - </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/02/international/europe/02galloway.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=a3295fe213e5261f&amp;ex=1277956800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">George Galloway</a></p>
<p>In a relativism culture of social permissiveness, the non-judgmental attitude, held out as the suitable standard for conduct, has become the politically correct behavior. One might think that anything goes under this mindset. However, the exact opposite practice and enforcement, under the most rigid conditions, is championed as necessary for enlighten and tolerant liberalists. The proliferation of demands that hate speech is the new capital crime, actually is counter iterative in building a civil society. This orthodoxy of the fanatical, proudly presents this illuminated and required deportment, as obligatory for all citizens.</p>
<p>So what exactly is hate for the neo-Jacobins? Obviously, whatever the &#8220;<em>Society of the Friends of the LIVING Constitution</em>&#8221; deems it to be, because under the color of law, the self-proclaimed pure of heart, are justified to off the heads of anyone who dares speak out in inappropriate terms. Remember &#8220;thinking progress&#8221; for the greater good, must be imposed on anyone who dare defies the wisdom of the gatekeepers for the collective.</p>
<p>Racism has to go, unless practiced by Negros against whites, or is the mere mention of such a term a slight to African-Americans? Once upon a time cries of anti-Semitism would be heard if <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/la-naacp-head-resigns-move-honor-sterling-23556060">Donald Sterling</a> was made a pariah after the NAACP did an about face after awarding him for promoting civil rights. Not in today’s world, such a distasteful zealot no longer has the protection of his tribe from the scrutiny of the thought police. The almost total condemnation of his recently private remarks has the entire sports world clambering for his forced sale of the LA Clippers.</p>

<p>Such broad-minded fans in a league that made homies multimillionaires and took them out of the hood, must not be dis. No wonder the attraction of not just the NBA, but sports in general, have serious minded buffs of the Wide World of Sports looking for, &#8220;<em>The Thrill of Victory&#8230;</em>&#8221; in other arenas. Why not demonstrate that sporting enthusiasm and jock celebrity worship, by starting a grassroots campaign to install America’s favorite redneck, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/conservatives-defend-duck-dynasty-star-phil-robertsons-anti-gay-remarks-1516160">Phil Robertson</a> and his Duck Dynasty clan, as the new ownership of the team.Surely, good standing Democrats should have no problem supporting a bunch of good old boys from the South. Frances Rice writes in the National Black Republicans Association site that, <a href="http://www.nationalblackrepublicans.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=pages.DYKKKKTerroristArmoftheDemocratParty">KKK Terrorist Arm of the Democratic Party</a>. &#8220;This ugly fact about the Democrat Party is detailed in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Reconstruction-Eric-Foner/dp/0060964316">A Short History of Reconstruction</a>, (Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc., 1990) by Dr. Eric Foner, the renowned liberal historian who is the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. Dr. Foner in his book explores the history of the origins of Ku Klux Klan and provides a chilling account of the atrocities committed by Democrats against Republicans, black and white.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/">Carole Emberton</a>, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today. Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Fast forward to today’s conductor <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/eric_holder_hate_crimes_and_his_people.html">Eric Holder</a>, of selective bigoted <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/032414.html">racism</a>, when describing &#8220;his people&#8221;, who &#8220;seem to get a pass on hate crime charges when they select whites for their blood sport&#8221;, one needs to question who the real haters are. David Risselada provides a valid assessment in the essay, <a href="http://patriotupdate.com/articles/hate-crimes-legislation-racial-identity-politics-institutional-racism-left/">Hate Crimes Legislation . . . Racial Identity Politics and the Institutional Racism of the Left</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The institutional racism that is built in our society is the responsibility of the left. Throughout history it has been the democrats who have supported segregation and slavery while continuously voting against civil rights legislation. Today, they attempt to hide their history through racial identity politics, and the creation of a system where inequality is the new equality. By creating laws based on racial preferences, the left is telling minorities that they believe they are not as capable as white men and therefore need their programs in order to stand a chance in the racist United States of America. This does little but reinforce hatred while attempting to justify black on white violence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time and in a place long ago, the Democratic Party defended the rights of the individual to associate with individuals of their choosing and speak their minds openly and without concern of censor. Since the conversion to ecumenical orthodoxy, the authoritarians that gave you the New Deal and the Great Society have a long record of creating their own hatred of Free Speech. The example of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?hp">New York Times</a> vicious attack on <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2014/04/24/cliven-bundy-controversial-remarks-full-context-video-with-transcript/">Cliven Bundy</a> illustrates another trumped-up incident ripe to exploit.The New American, author William F. Jasper makes the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Much of what Mr. Bundy is saying closely parallels what even many black leaders, authors and intellectuals — such as Prof. Walter Williams, Rev. C.L. Bryant, Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, Bill Cosby, Alveda King, Star Parker, and Alan Keyes — have been saying. But Cliven Bundy’s &#8220;sin&#8221; is that he is an elderly white man who is unschooled in traversing the minefield of political correctness — and he was careless in failing to make important distinctions and clarifications. He &#8220;sinned&#8221; by being born when he was born, and failing to keep up with the constantly changing terminology for ethnic designations. He still uses the terms &#8220;Negro,&#8221; &#8220;colored people,&#8221; and &#8220;Mexican,&#8221; instead of &#8220;black/ African American&#8221; or &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; — but then, race activists still argue amongst themselves concerning the &#8220;proper&#8221; ethnic label to apply to their lineage and group identity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When Senator <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/goodbye-free-speech-mass-dem-wants-government-to-monitor-speech-for-hate">Ed Markey</a>, D-Mass., introduces legislation called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2014-04-08_HateCrimes_Legislation1.pdf">Hate Crime Reporting Act of 2014</a>,&#8221; it is another partisan concerted attempt to silence voices and views entirely protected under the First Amendment, by monitoring radio, television and Internet speech. Can one say arbitrary and capricious, or will Big Brother now prey on any convenient and moving target to label anyone as a hate monger, that does not conform to the &#8220;PC&#8221; orthodoxy?</p>

<p>The excellent video from Ben Swann identifies in <a href="http://youtu.be/fTn6skhq-08">New &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; Bill Will Attempt To Control Speech On Internet, Radio and TV</a>, that the real objective is to censor the internet.</p>
<p>Well, this development should concern any student of inquiry, but the real world often fosters political threats that seem to be so implausible, if they were not true. The case of the arrest of <a href="http://vdare.com/posts/britain-quoting-winston-churchill-about-islam-is-now-an-arrestable-offense">Paul Weston</a> should alarm everyone. In the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/michael-coren-interviews-paul-weston-concerning-his-free-speech-arrest">Michael Coren interview or Mr. Weston</a>, the vanguard of British lunacy once again blazes new trails in the annals of hate speech. If quoting Winston Churchill is now a crime, what does that make Winnie?The British Bulldog is his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property — either as a child, a wife, or a concubine — must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Move over denial ridden Americans; the English have a talent in leading the civilized world in false guilt. For the rest of humankind, they are perceptive enough to admit that the normal human condition acknowledges <a href="http://batr.org/view_/060501.html">Discrimination as a Virtue</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Discrimination has been characterized as racism. Quite to the contrary, discrimination is an ally in the struggle to end bigotry and injustice. When Liberty is suppressed in a quest for equality; hatred and revulsion breeds, for different groups, cultures and ideologies. All attempts to force equal treatment are futile, even when severe penalties are imposed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Condemning a person, solely by his beliefs, bias and predisposition – that fanatical frenzy will surely bring about the fall of our cherished tradition of Free Speech. For those who fear Sharia Law, you had better be more concerned about the progressive despots, who are the model for imposed intolerance through a government, which hates everyone that refuses their Groupthink.</p>

<p>Some professing Christians become infuriated when a “watchblogger” has the chutzpah to report on a false teacher by name, as if <em>naming names</em> is unbiblical.  High-profile leaders and bloggers who mention heretics by name are often accused of demonizing or judging them.</p>
<p>For example, when I expose <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiritual-research-network.com%2Frick_warren_purpose_driven.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGG_uXxP0Vx3qlFsAI6kyzKcdxKrg">Rick Warren’s</a> latest effort to unite with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lighthousetrailsresearch.com%2Fpeaceplan.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGy_bnykAgJBva8wVRTVmyQGEG31w">globalists</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.understandthetimes.org%2Fcommentary%2Fc145rickwarren.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEY6u5zDfpCLnEWT26EzJ0uRSnUzg">Catholics</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ocregister.com%2Farticles%2Fmuslims-341669-warren-saddleback.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXcxjfkxkw8qBqqpxt6ESsmuvy4A">Muslims</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F110124&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiF_q_2AwTLQ4sDLs1yW7u9WlT7Q">New Age/New Thought occultists</a>, and when I examine his <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120321&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHocIiR7OliHu8onwzT3pKZGsoXQ">health plan</a> and his penchant for<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XXOO91ISmQ">twisting Scripture</a> (he often uses it as a tool to cover his own ideas with a pretense of divine authority), complaints come pouring in by the truck load.  Many of his defenders write to set me straight on what Scripture says about “judging him.”  Others scold me for not giving him credit for all the good he has done, as if doing good deeds, meeting felt needs and ignoring doctrine and creeds is biblical.</p>
<p>Invariably someone will cite <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F18.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXN7SiIBirCXaFqnDO_MmBPNfN1A">Matthew 18:15-17</a> :</p>
<p><em>If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</em><em> But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.</em></p>
<p>And then they’ll ask if I’ve gone privately to Rick Warren to correct him.  My response is “Of course not!”  Why?  For the reason that Christian celebrities like Rick Warren are generally not accessible.  Many are, in fact, akin to Hollywood celebs.  No doubt some of them rationalize that their popularity affords them certain privileges, one of which is to choose not to have a dialogue with those of us who write anything negative about them.</p>
<p>Yet the Bible says that those who are in sin (false teaching is sin) must be admonished.  In <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F3_john%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-hBYu9nGEL7a1TScadxixYSeJ5g">3 John 1:9</a> the Apostle John calls out Diotrephes and promises to publicly correct him upon his return. In <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fgalatians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6rVc04g_LsLrEkux-BmPg9JJjdA">Galatians 2:11-14</a> Paul stands up to the highly esteemed Apostle Peter!   He even got in Peter’s face for fearing false teachers. What resulted from Peter’s “fear of man”?:</p>
<p><em>And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was <strong>led astray by their hypocrisy</strong>.  But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, ‘If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?’ </em>(bold added)</p>
<p>In context the Matthew 18 passages (above) addresses the ways in which the leadership must go about disciplining a brother or sister in their church who has fallen into sin.  It also provides the proper steps to take before excommunicating someone who refuses to repent.  First, we are to go to him in private and if he refuses to repent we are to go a second time taking with us two or more witnesses.  If he still refuses to repent, the pastor must go before the church and proclaim his sin.  Ouch!</p>
<p>It’s essential that elders are involved in the process.</p>
<p>Likewise, the passages in Matthew 18 don’t apply to doctrinal issues nor do they apply to Christians who have put their work before the world.  A person’s willingness to do so makes them fair game for anyone who wishes to scrutinize and even criticize his or her work.   Consequently, Christians who can’t stand the heat should get out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>But I’m drifting from my point.</p>
<p>When believers make a judgment, we’re not to judge <em>self-righteously.  </em>Moreover, we’re not to judge a person&#8217;s heart or motives.  Those who do are sinning.</p>
<p>Because I <em>name names</em> I’m often accused of being judgmental<em>.</em>  All I can do is respond with Scripture:</p>
<p><em>The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. ‘For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?’  But we have the mind of Christ.</em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_corinthians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAN_P3vy8vtdSA9BMuv1JJ0IsZeQ">1 Corinthians 2:15-16</a>)</p>
<p>What?  You mean the true believer has the <em>mind of Christ</em>?  Yes!  This is a difficult concept to grasp to be sure, so I’ll point you to Matthew Henry’s commentary:</p>
<p><em>The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man&#8217;s wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. … And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. <strong>In the Holy Scriptures</strong>, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. <strong>It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit</strong>. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.</em> (bold added &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fcommentaries%2Fmhc%2F1_corinthians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkQM00puhc_jjRsCEe_lBvo1jn_w">Source</a>)</p>
<p>In short, it is the spiritual man (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fdictionary-regeneration&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeSmsHuwpDbHzVRhBqrclFR5ftKA">regenerate</a>) who possesses the<em> </em>mind of Christ and has received the knowledge of His will which is laid out for us in Scripture.  Therefore, the believer who is truly walking with the Lord— <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F121018&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwAHNDAtZ8_olCeeFKfHkCIyjxBw">in His will</a>&#8211;has the authority to judge words and actions &#8212; especially when the teaching is unbiblical.</p>
<p>How do we know when someone’s teaching is unbiblical?  That’s easy!  Test his teaching against the Word of God and if it doesn’t line up with what’s in the Bible, then what’s being taught is not from God! And if what’s being taught is not from God it’s from another source – the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fephesians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGB5SqF8X145liKUJYRgKJW57jDyQ"> spiritual forces of evil in heavenly places</a>!</p>
<p>Bible teacher and expositor John MacArthur cautions:</p>
<p><em>It should be noted that </em>[Matthew 7:1-5]<em> has erroneously been used to suggest that believers should never evaluate or criticize anyone for anything. Our day hates absolutes, especially theological and moral absolutes, and such simplistic interpretation provides a convenient escape from confrontation. Members of modern society, including many professing Christians, tend to resist dogmatism and strong convictions about right and wrong. Many people prefer to speak of all-inclusive love, compromise, ecumenism, and unity. To the modern religious person those are the only “doctrines” worth defending, and they are the doctrines to which every conflicting doctrine must be sacrificed.  </em>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gty.org%2Fresources%2Fbible-qna%2FBQ112912%2Fjudging-others--the-verse-pagans-love-to-quote&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrUBC-iXQd89FWQ2OIABy_wddtXg">Source</a>)</p>
<p>In my experience, many professing Christians stubbornly stick to their position that those who expose the unbiblical teaching of Christian celebs are unfairly judging them so they play the<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F7.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGj-uvsnb1TcHINh9-24vYs_EdLGA">Matthew 7:1-5</a> card: &#8220;Judge not, that you be not judged” followed by a resounding rebuke from verse 5: “You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye?”</p>
<p>Christians who fail to grasp the notion that those who are Spirit-filled have the <em>mind of Christ</em> is mind boggling.  Only believers can make this claim &#8212; no one else can.  And that includes Miss Spirituality herself, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120507&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExBXarCqOHwN2-lSGzbTk6euqV8A">Oprah Winfrey</a>!  Why?  Since Oprah is unregenerate she cannot possible understand spiritual truth because her <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fromans%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAFEYj3q3W281ixj49e8hJhs1Dvw">heart is darkened</a>!</p>
<p>God’s ways and His Word make little sense to the unsaved.  Listen to what Paul says:</p>
<p><em>The natural person </em>[unregenerate]<em> does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.&#8221;</em> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_corinthians%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAN_P3vy8vtdSA9BMuv1JJ0IsZeQ">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>)</p>
<p>There is no other place we can learn about the things of the Spirit of God except in the Bible.  Moreover, the Bible’s the final authority in all matters of faith.  In <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fniv%2F2_timothy%2F3.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGpWBFp2aQSLXcKIQ1slt08QeIx3Q">2 Timothy 3:16</a> we’re told that “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.”  And  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_peter%2F1.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXLKUHGyfhn2ABKDyZX9x3jv3cxQ">2 Peter 1:21</a> says “For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.”  Although every page of Scripture is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fbible-inspired&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFboVYMSim_EmwjclMZxUcgEBDyxw">God-breathed</a>, a growing number of Christians choose to reject hard to understand Bible stories and doctrines.  Two examples that come to mind are the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Fcreation-story.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8utH6L2ydavMIRqRotgjy7nDe5w">Creation story</a> in Genesis chapters 1 &amp; 2 and our Lord’s teaching that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblebb.com%2Ffiles%2Fryle%2Ffire_fire.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXxWdDiE0wQVmTBwhD3VH4gZ22QA">hell</a> is a place of fire, demons and everlasting torment.  Some readers will be surprised to learn that Christ preached more on hell than all the other persons in the Bible put together!</p>
<p>It’s unbelievable how many professing Christians don’t study their bibles.  They may attend church regularly but because they’re biblically illiterate they have no clue if the pastor’s teaching God’s truth or outright heresy.  In many cases they wouldn’t know biblical truth if it walked up and bit them on the nose!</p>
<p>I regularly hear from Christians whose heart’s desire is to attend a healthy well-balanced church where they can be confident that they’re receiving good solid biblical teaching.  They’ve searched high and low to find a gospel teaching church near their home but there are none.  And they’re discouraged.  The sad fact is that only a handful of ministers still preach the <em>true</em> <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcarm.org%2Fwhat-gospel&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG91KnTefqfqTsg7mIy5pfiksGMFg">gospel of Jesus Christ</a>.  My advice is always the same: “Don’t give up searching!”  But this is a subject for a whole other article so I’ll move on.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“According to the evidence that I’ve seen …Odessa was a giant false flag operation. It… was one of those staged massacres that the pro-Western forces from Bosnia to Kosovo, now Ukraine, excel at staging, intended to draw Russia to overreact and commit military forces … I believe that the fact that they are willing to stage such a horrendous atrocity shows the depth of their desperation at this point.”</em></p>
<p>– <strong>Nebojsa Malic</strong>, political analyst, Russia Today</p>
<p><em>“Not under foreign skies<br />
Nor under foreign wings protected -<br />
I shared all this with my own people<br />
There, where misfortune had abandoned us.”</em></p>
<p>– “Requiem” – <strong>Anna Akhmatova</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Photos of the victims of the Odessa fire which have been circulating on the<a href="http://ersieesist.livejournal.com/813.html?nojs=">Internet</a> have cast doubt on the official version of events. It’s now clear that many of the anti-junta activists who occupied the Trade Unions House were neither burned to death nor died of smoke inhalation, but were savagely shot at point-blank range by agents and thugs who had infiltrated the building to kill as many of the occupants as possible, burn the corpses, and then slip away without notice. Some of the victims–like a young woman who was eight months pregnant –were strangled with an electrical chord and left slumped backwards over her desk in a room that shows no sign of fire or smoke damage. In another case, a woman was stripped naked from the waste down, raped, killed, and set ablaze.</p>
<p>In still other cases, victims with bullet-holes through their skulls, had flammable fluid dumped on their heads and were incinerated, leaving a charred head atop a corpse whose clothes were untouched by fire. The sloppily-executed killing-spree proves that the fire was not the result of a spontaneous clash between pro and anti-Kiev demonstrators, but a carefully planned black-op that likely involved foreign Intel agencies working hand-in-hand with the fascist junta government in Kiev. Did we mention that the CIA has taken up residence in the Ukrainian capital? Here’s the scoop from the AFP:</p>
<p>“Dozens of specialists from the US Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation are advising the Ukrainian government … helping Kiev end the rebellion in the east of Ukraine and set up a functioning security structure…” (<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/cia-fbi-agents-advising-ukraine-government-report-101508429.html">CIA, FBI agents ‘advising Ukraine government</a>: report, AFP)</p>
<p>We all know about the CIA’s energetic efforts to create a “functioning security structure” in nations around the world. The CIA’s presence in Ukraine suggests that the US was either actively involved in the Odessa incident or knows who was. Either way, there should be an independent investigation before the case is referred to the ICC for prosecution.</p>
<p>The rampage in Odessa is part a broader strategy to provoke Moscow into a military confrontation. US war planners want to draw Putin into a conflict to justify NATO expansion, block further EU-Russian economic integration, and facilitate the “pivot to Asia.” The victims in this tragedy were sacrificed to advance Washington’s imperial ambitions and to establish US global hegemony. Obama has repeatedly reiterated his unwavering support for the crackdown on dissidents in the east. In a Rose Garden press conference just days ago, the president applauded the military attack on civilians saying, “The Ukrainian government has shown remarkable restraint throughout this whole process.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the Odessa graveyards are now full of people who can attest to the great restraint of the junta government that Obama so admires.</p>
<p>The coverage of the Odessa massacre by the western media is as bad as any in recent memory. The giant news conglomerates no longer make any attempt to pretend they’re anything other propaganda organs for the State. Even by that low standard, the coverage has been abysmal. Here’s a typical summary from an article on the liberal website, Huffington Post.</p>
<p>“Police said the deadly fire broke out in a trade union building, but did not give details on how it started. Earlier, police said at least three people had died in a clash between the two sides in the city of 1 million.</p>
<p>According to Ukrainian news reports, the pro-Kiev demonstrators broke up an encampment of Moscow supporters outside the trade union building. The latter took refuge in the building, which then caught fire.<br />
Odessa police spokesman Volodymyr Shasbliyenko told AP the fire apparently was caused by Molotov cocktails. He had no further details or identities of the victims.” (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/02/police-38-dead-in-protes_n_5255399.html">Odessa Building Fire Kills Dozens</a>, AP)</p>
<p>The author deliberately misleads his readers about what really took place. The fire did not “break out” in a trade union building. It was started. There’s no debate about this. There’s video footage of the whole incident and tons of eyewitness reports. Right sector goons started the fire by throwing Molotov cocktails through the windows. It’s all on tape.</p>
<p>Second, the “pro-Kiev demonstrators” (did not) “break up an encampment of Moscow supporters outside the trade union building…which then caught fire.” This is nonsense. The fascist extremists burned down the tent city, chased the activists into the building, barricaded the exits, and then set the building on fire with the obvious intention of killing the people inside. Again, there is no debate about this. It’s all on video. The US media is involved in a massive cover up, mainly because a investigation would undoubtedly point to US involvement. This is why none of the major news organizations are covering an incident which would normally be headline news. Odessa is unique blend of Waco and Columbine, a combo that editors typically use to boost sagging ratings by exploiting public empathy and outrage. Only this time, the media has minimized its coverage and refused to report on a story that would probably lead straight to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<p>While the New York Times has been widely criticized for publishing fake photos of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal wins the trophy for absolute worst coverage. In a piece titled “Deadly Ukraine Fire Likely Sparked by Rebels, Government Says”, the WSJ pushes the improbable theory that the anti-coup activists inside the building actually burned the building down themselves, a pathetic attempt to blame the victims of a ruthless government crackdown. Here’s an excerpt from the article:</p>
<p>“The fire began from the roof. There were extremists there, we found casings and firearms,” Mr. Chebotar said. “But something unexpected happened; their Molotov cocktails fell, and ignited the higher floors of the building.” (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304831304579545093207787978?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304831304579545093207787978.html">Deadly Ukraine Fire Likely Sparked by Rebels</a>, Wall Street Journal)</p>
<p>Utterly ridiculous. Are the editors of the WSJ aware of the fact that footage of the Neo Nazis throwing Molotov cocktails at the building are all over the Internet?</p>
<p>The article, of course, fails to explain how many of the people inside the building were either shot or strangled to death. Nor does the author speculate on why the police stood by while people hurled themselves from windows to escape the fire or were savagely beaten by right wing extremists on the pavement in front of the building. Instead, the WSJ tries to provide a plausible excuse for the one part of the story it chooses to focus on as if “who started the fire” can be separated from other important details. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the 40 victims of the incident were killed in a homicidal rampage that was perpetrated by Obama’s new friends in Kiev. No amount of whitewash is going to hide that one glaring fact. Here’s how Serbian historian and political analyst, Nebosja Malic, summed it up:</p>
<p>“According to all the evidence that I have seen, the entire thing in Odessa was a giant false flag operation. It was a provocation, it was one of those stage massacres that the pro-Western forces from Bosnia to Kosovo, now Ukraine excel at staging, intended to draw Russia to overreact…</p>
<p>“We have proof that the West is instigating this. And just the other day, Catherine Ashton, the EU’s commissioner for foreign policy, pretty much gave a green light to the extremists from Kiev. She pretty much said they had a right to establish law and order within the borders of the country. I would say that the EU has blood on its hands, especially Catherine Ashton. It’s the same thing they did in Yugoslavia in the 90s, when they started encouraging radicals, extremists, secessionists.” (Interview with Nebosja Malic, RT)</p>
<p>It’s true that Washington supports Neo-Nazi extremists who burned down the Odessa Trade Unions House. If that wasn’t the case, then Obama would have spoken out forcefully against the action, which he has not. That implies that things are going according to plan. Malic is also correct when he says the fire was a “giant false flag operation” which refers to a covert military operation where agents disguise themselves as members of their adversary’s group to initiate a provocation that will then be blamed on the other side. In this case, pro-regime fascists (and probably agents from the Security Services) disguised themselves as Kiev regime opponents, in order to throw bricks and stones at the police and Right Sector goons. This was the flashpoint that started the melee that ended in a massacre.</p>
<p>Videos on Russia Today show the agents in red arm bands mingled with the pro-Russia activists, initiated a confrontation with the cops, and then quickly switched sides when the fighting broke out. This is classic false flag operation. The police were obviously in on the scam, as they immediately opened their ranks to let the imposters slip by when the street-scrum began. These same imposters were later filmed shooting handguns and automatic weapons in the direction of the building just minutes after they had switched sides. (Take a look at <a href="http://rt.com/bulletin-board/156776-rtnews-may05-1700msk/">this video</a> from 3:30 minutes to the 6 minute-point and decide for yourself whether this was a false flag operation or not.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: There was nothing spontaneous about the clash that led to the catastrophic fire that killed 40 people in the Trade Unions House. It was a carefully planned and executed operation designed to shock Moscow into sending troops to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine. If the CIA is working in Kiev –as it is–there is no doubt that they either knew or actively assisted the operation.</p>
<p>In related news: Moscow has announced it will “deploy additional forces in Crimea as part of beefing up the Black Sea fleet…before year’s end”. According to RT: “The fleet will receive new submarines and surface ships of new generation this year.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin is responding to the buildup of NATO forces in Eastern Europe and the Black Sea where additional aircraft, warships and ground troops have been deployed in case war breaks out. Also, according to RT:</p>
<p>“NATO’s three-week ‘Spring Storm’ drills, involving a record-breaking number of 6,000 troops, have begun in Estonia….(bringing) together a record number of allied troops.” (Also) around 150 personnel of the US airborne division arrived in a military transport aircraft to Amari airbase (while) the UK and France deployed eight fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland to strengthen NATO air defense over the Baltic regions.” (<a href="http://rt.com/news/156928-nato-military-drills-estonia/">NATO’s record 6,000-strong drills kick off in Estonia amid Ukraine tensions</a>, RT)</p>
<p>So while the death toll mounts, the slide to war continues to gain momentum. Odessa was supposed to be the tipping point, the “catalyzing event” that would draw Putin into the fighting. But it hasn’t worked out that way. Putin has stayed on the sidelines and refused to take the bait. That means there’ll be more provocations to come; more false flags, more bloodshed, more stage-managed terror disguised as civil unrest. Eventually, people will see who’s behind all the trouble. But how many will have died by then?</p>

<p>We are witnessing, I believe, a turning point in geopolitical history, one future historians may analyze as we have the Roman Empire’s fall. Vladimir Putin is making a move — and it’s not just against Ukraine. It may not be just a move against Eastern Europe. It’s not even, perhaps, just a move against US world dominance.</p>
<p>There was a time when the USSR was the “evil empire, a godless Golgotha. But that was then. Now, in 2013-14, Putin has seen fit to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/28/whos-godless-now-russia-says-its-us/?page=1">say</a>, in his December State of the Nation speech, “Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values. …Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation.”</p>
<p>This roughly coincided with Russia’s enactment of laws prohibiting homosexual propaganda and was a salvo against both the West’s Great Sexual Heresy and what enables it: moral relativism.</p>
<p>In another shot at relativism, Putin averred, “Society is now required…to accept without question the equality of good and evil, strange as it seems, concepts that are opposite in meaning.”</p>
<p>The Russian president then took aim at multiculturalism: “Today, many nations are revising their moral values and ethical norms, eroding ethnic traditions and differences between peoples and cultures.”</p>
<p>And now we’re seeing the release of Russian Culture War 2.0. In a document called &#8220;Foundations of the State Cultural Policy,&#8221; the Kremlin is doubling down and<a href="http://articles.mcall.com/2014-04-04/opinion/mc-russia-putin-west-web-20140404_1_leonid-bershidsky-ivanov-russia"> writes</a>, &#8220;Russia must be viewed as a unique and original civilization that cannot be reduced to &#8216;East&#8217; or &#8216;West.&#8217; …A concise way of formulating this stand would be, ‘Russia is not Europe.’” The document goes on to state that Russia rejects “such principles as multiculturalism and tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;projects imposing alien values on society.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, this is not your grandfather’s Russia.</p>
<p>But it very well may be your great-grandfather’s.</p>
<p>There are a few different things, I suspect, going on here. The 20 years after the Cold War’s end had been a period of <em>relative</em> co-operation between Russia and the West, but you can’t define yourself by going along (to get along) with the world’s cultural hegemon; you can’t be band leader by playing second fiddle. So Putin is defining his nation as the un-morally-wild West. In addition, he knows that to rally a people behind you, you need a boogeyman, your Eurasia, the “Nappy” (Napoleon) who will “get you,” British children, if you’re not good.</p>
<p>Yet it isn’t just that Putin is restarting the Cold War. Nor is he just an old-line KGB Bolshevik, as some stuck in commentary amber have suggested. He’s smart enough to realize that Marxism is, as the kids today would say, just so “played.”</p>
<p>He more likely wants to be the next czar.</p>
<p>What’s my theory? Try this on for size: It isn’t just that Putin wants to restore lost Russian glory.</p>
<p>He sees a chance to be a historic figure.</p>
<p>Note here that you don’t have to be good to be historic; Roman statesman Cicero called Julius Caesar an “ambitious villain,” but Caesar’s name is far better known than Cicero’s. And let’s consider what might be Putin’s calculation: the West has long been the world’s cultural trend-setter, spreading an increasingly un-Christian creed to all corners of the Earth. Of course, not everyone is on board. The Islamic abode wants nothing to do with it, but it’s Muslim; sub-Saharan Africa is largely opposed, but it lacks clout. As for South America, in addition to lacking clout it’s confused; and while China is gaining power, it’s largely pagan and non-committal on the culture war.</p>
<p>Enter the second Vladimir the Great.</p>
<p>Putin doesn’t just see a chance to define himself — and to unite the Russian people behind him — via opposition to the West, as his Marxist comrades once did.</p>
<p>He sees a chance to do it as today’s Charlemagne.</p>
<p>There’s an unsatisfied market for Christendom’s standard bearer, and Putin perceives an opportunity to exploit it. China won’t do it, Africa can’t, South America wouldn’t and couldn’t. But just as the original Vladimir the Great Christianized the Kievan Rus&#8217;, just as Charlemagne forged and helped Christianize modern Europe, Putin has a chance to lift the cross — and himself — high.</p>
<p>And the West is a gift that keeps on giving insofar as this goes. Our cultural Marxists are on the march, smell blood and will not stop. They will continue spending us into insolvency, perverting us into prone position, relativizing us into risibility and “immigrationizing” us into irrelevance. Even now, not satisfied with placing another great nail in marriage’s coffin, our militant secularists are making moves to<a href="http://selwynduke.typepad.com/selwyndukecom/2013/09/the-slippery-slope-to-pedophilia.html"> legitimize pedophilia</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2352779/Bestiality-brothels-spreading-Germany-campaigner-claims-abusers-sex-animals-lifestyle-choice.html">bestiality</a>. It’s onward Luciferian soldiers.</p>
<p>And for Putin, it’s onward Christian soldier. As our degradation advances, Russia’s star can rise commensurately. Putin knows the West is in decline. He sees the demographic trends, that the US is transforming into a Third World/Hispanic nation and Western Europe into a Third World/Muslim continent. He knows that if there is another superpower in the near future, it will be Russia or China. And he knows what card he has to play to win this game.</p>
<p>Of course, while we could argue about whether the Christian-soldier solution is tactic and strategy or just tactic, it is so obviously prudent that it’s inconceivable Putin wouldn’t have pursued it. Just consider the benefits, starting with justification of Russian expansionism. If you’re a typical Russian, might not the idea that “the West is decadent, debauched, exhausted and effete” justify, in your mind, a Russian manifest destiny? Might it not be natural and wholly in accordance with man’s nature to believe that your moral superiority gives you the right to dominate? Note that this is the theory that helped justify the colonial powers’ imperialism: they were bringing civilization to a world of darkness. And it’s what we do to this day, applying secular values as standard. How often have we heard intervention in the Islamic “stan” du jour justified by pointing out that its rulers oppress women and are intolerant? The judgments are different, but the desire to claim the moral high ground is the same.</p>
<p>Then consider foreign relations. The USSR used to jockey for world influence with us; whereas before they had to market Marxism, however, now they can peddle purity. Standing against decadent Western secular-imperialism can win Russia many friends in Africa and even the Middle East, and most of the Far East will go with the dominant power.</p>
<p>Lastly, even if Putin is a functional atheist — even if his road to Heaven is paved with bad intentions — he surely knows that if Russia wants to prosper, Western secular/hedonist isms must be rejected. And why wouldn’t he know? As Soviet defector Yuri Bezmenov and others have<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJKJM36lMTE"> explained</a>, it was his erstwhile Marxist buddies who encouraged those movements in the West for the purposes of undermining our civilization.</p>
<p>But we’re doing a very good job of undermining it ourselves, and Putin is more concerned with building his own. Pat Buchanan recently <a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/pat-buchanan/whose-side-is-god-on-now.html">wrote</a> about this and pointed out that Putin may very well view his realm as “The Third Rome:”</p>
<p>The first Rome was the Holy City and seat of Christianity that fell to Odoacer and his barbarians in 476 A.D. The second Rome was Constantinople, Byzantium, (today&#8217;s Istanbul), which fell to the Turks in 1453. The successor city to Byzantium, the Third Rome, the last Rome to the old believers, was — Moscow.</p>
<p>Putin is entering a claim that Moscow is the Godly City of today and command post of the counter-reformation against the new paganism.</p>
<p>…Putin is saying the new ideological struggle is between a debauched West led by the United States and a traditionalist world Russia would be proud to lead.</p>
<p>Note here that the term “czar” is derived from the Latin word <em>Caesar</em>. And while Putin may be just as satisfied to be Julius or Augustus as Constantine, I’m quite sure that Marxism is no longer his bag. That would be playing second fiddle again — and the last thing the Russians want to be is like us.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Few would expect a survivor of the Holocaust to be the face of genocide denial. Imagine the surprise of Suffolk Law School’s student body when its administration’s chosen commencement speaker turned out to be just that.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Abraham Foxman, the long-time director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization dedicated to eradicating anti-Semitism and bigotry and protecting civil rights, seems a figure beyond reproach. Yet Foxman has invited controversy to Suffolk University for his unwillingness to recognize the 1915 Armenian Genocide &#8211; an event which saw an estimated 1.5 million Armenians massacred by the Turks &#8211; and his campaign to defeat Congressional acknowledgement of said genocide.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Criticism of Foxman has centered on this disconnect, that a man who lived through the attempted extermination of an entire race now denies that truth of another. Many at Suffolk are unwilling to participate in that hypocrisy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Suffolk’s Students Speak Out</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Shortly after Foxman was announced as their 2014 speaker, Suffolk Law students <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2014%2F04%2F21%2Fsome-suffolk-students-criticize-choice-adl-leader-abraham-foxman-law-school-commencement-speaker%2FAEvvrb6dYabiYNOliYmZiN%2Fstory.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4FNY3H8izw16kHqjimxPNPJ6hmA" target="_blank">rejected the decision</a>. Amy Willis, President of the university’s National Lawyers Guild chapter, told the Boston Globe that “Suffolk claims to embody diversity and be a place for all people, but this clearly is a speaker who does not embody those values.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This stance was reflected in <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.change.org%2Fpetitions%2Fpresident-james-mccarthy-remove-adl-director-abe-foxman-as-suffolk-law-s-2014-commencement-speaker&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmq997oOF_fGcmbAhi8aPS1llc3w" target="_blank">a petition to remove Foxman</a> as the keynote speaker, as well as to deny him the honorary Juris doctorate he is slated to receive. The petition states that Foxman’s presence “not only insults students and their families, but also insults the very foundation of Suffolk Law as a safe place of diversity and acceptance.” As arguments for his removal, the petition enumerates Foxman’s refusal to explicitly label the Armenian Genocide as a genocide as well as his support for <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Farticles%2F2013%2F04%2F29%2Fabe-foxman-rationalizes-blanket-spying-on-american-muslims.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOUZxFH00m9ddv9zQ7Tv9tl68RcQ" target="_blank">racial profiling of Muslim-Americans</a> in the interest of “national security.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>What Is Genocide?</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Raphael Lemkin coined the term “genocide” in 1944 to describe the magnitude of premeditated racial extermination, citing <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCebMq-GmH4" target="_blank">what happened to the Armenians</a> as the prime example. After the war, the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genocidescholars.org%2Fresources%2Fabout-genocide&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVTI-pdcJn_c4mcV8BZ3nHJddRuw" target="_blank">establishing genocide as an international crime</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In the Convention, genocide is defined as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,” which includes “killing members of the group” and “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The mention of “intent” is significant in this definition. Foxman’s 2007 statement (described below) would go out of its way to avoid labeling the Turkish pogrom as intentional, admitting only that its “consequences” were “tantamount” to genocide. To the casual observer, it is perhaps a negligible distinction. From a legal standpoint, it is strategically evasive.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>What Is the Armenian Genocide?</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This definition applies to the systematic slaughter of Armenians by the Turkish government that began in 1915. To understand how this genocide came to be, a brief summary of the two nations’ history is required.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Existing in various forms for approximately 3,000 years of recorded history, Armenia was the first nation to declare Christianity its national religion. It remained Christian under the several empires that conquered it, including the Muslim caliphate of the Ottoman Turks. From the 15th century onward, Armenians and their fellow “infidels” were allowed to continue their religious practices, though subjected to higher taxes, fewer rights and ethnic discrimination. For the Armenians, this culminated in the Hamidian Massacres of 1894-1897. This state-sponsored pogrom was instituted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in retaliation for Armenians’ attempts to win civil rights.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">By the start of World War I, political tensions between Armenians and a new Turkish government were even more strained. Armenia itself had been divided by warring empires, with Russia claiming the east and Turkey claiming the west. Duty-bound, both sides fought for their respective empires.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This dichotomy of loyalty enabled the Turks to concoct a pretext that veiled their ultimate goal of an ethnically and religiously uniform empire. A purge would enable them to <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armenian-genocide.org%2Fchronology.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_noTfzxOnV1l2a2NixiNCXCP-gg" target="_blank">“liquidate”</a> the “Christian element” and seize the wealth and property of suspected insurgents. On April 24, 1915, the Turkish government authorized the arrest and execution of several hundred Armenian intellectuals. From that point, the executions would continue for eight years, shrouded under the fog of the Great War.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Turkish soldiers and mercenaries acting under the general outfit of “Special Operations” murdered hundreds of thousands of Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks, marching them through the Anatolian and Syrian deserts without food, water or clothing. “Infidels” not sentenced to hard labor camps were drowned in rivers, thrown off cliffs, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genocide-museum.am%2Feng%2Fonline_exhibition_6.php&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7z9EthV9wnjxIb8g4zVa4FHOazw" target="_blank">crucified</a> and burned alive. Property was seized, women were raped and dispatched to Turkish harems, and many children were kidnapped and forcibly converted to Islam.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The number of survivors is a matter of debate, but of a population of 2 million indigenous Armenians, it is estimated that upwards of 1.5 million were slaughtered in Turkey between 1915 and 1923. Even today, almost a century later, the Euphrates River is filled with the bones of dead Armenians, as author Peter Balakian, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2008%2F12%2F07%2Fmagazine%2F07lives-t.html%3F_r%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqWmK3E0TiLrjQq33rjHRbRcM52g" target="_blank">writing for the New York Times magazine</a>, can attest.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Stark, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armenian-genocide.org%2Fphoto_wegner_view.html%3Fphoto%3Ddoorstep.jpg%26collection%3Dwegner%26caption%3DYoung%2Bboy%2Bdies%2Bon%2Bdoorstep&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_zNaUR5b7FI-XKNZT6xta7ikq2w" target="_blank">horrific images</a> exist to document the savagery of the Armenian massacre. Yet still Turkey denies its own legacy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><b>Turkey and Foxman’s Denials</b></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Article 301 of the Turkish penal code <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldpoliticsreview.com%2Farticles%2F517%2Fhrant-dink-silenced-in-the-shadow-of-turkeys-penal-code-301&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBpkWpxHc3GNFaEhBBBrdio_GQSw" target="_blank">makes it illegal</a> to insult Turkey, the Turkish nation or the Turkish government. To acknowledge an “Armenian Genocide” is the most egregious insult possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Because Turkey was the first nation in the Middle East to establish diplomatic relations with Israel and remains an instrumental ally of the West, the United States is unwilling to rock that political boat. Even when a resolution was proposed by the 110th Congress to recognize the Armenian Genocide, then President George W. Bush publicly opposed the measure. He was not the first, and current President Barack Obama’s silence on the issue suggests he will not be the last.</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zflmBNjHfAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And this has been <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salon.com%2F2010%2F06%2F16%2Fisrael_lobby_genocide_armenia%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVOK4suS51HRJvpk02rNhAFsRgrw" target="_blank">Abraham Foxman’s dilemma</a>. His public opposition to Armenian recognition has been out of loyalty to Israel. “Our focus is Israel,” he has said. “If helping Turkey helps Israel, then that’s what we’re in the business of doing.” It seems absurd to the point of tragedy that a man who lived under Nazi oppression can answer the question of Armenian genocide with, “It was wartime. Things get messy.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But in 2007, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Farticles%2F2007%2F08%2F22%2Fadl_chief_bows_to_critics%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBW_ewx184FxE85usCF-thG7iELg" target="_blank">Foxman tried to pacify his critics</a>. Speaking for himself and the ADL, he stated that, “We have never negated but have always described the painful events of 1915-1918 perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire against Armenians as massacres and atrocities,” ending with decision that “the consequences of those actions were indeed tantamount to genocide.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But “tantamount to genocide” without intent is not genocide. This calculated elision of “intent,” its palpable absence, is an insult to the Armenian community. The ADL’s defenders decry this as splitting hairs, but they overlook the importance of legacy and how powerfully a single word can affect it. It was important enough to prompt a dozen Massachusetts cities to pull out of the ADL’s “No Place for Hate” anti-bias program. It was important enough that when Andrew H. Tarsy, a regional director for the ADL, acknowledged the genocide <i>as </i>true genocide, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boston.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Farticles%2F2007%2F08%2F18%2Fadl_local_leader_fired_on_armenian_issue%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiHHlBKEfC2WPMkdffAxm1xlhjmg" target="_blank">he was promptly fired from the organization</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately for Suffolk Law School, and all those who expect the ADL to uphold its own morality, Abraham Foxman represents a willful blindness &#8211; to look the other way on a hundred-year-old crime &#8211; for the sake of political expediency.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is the opinion of Suffolk University President James McCarthy that Foxman, despite students’ protests, <a style="color: #0000cc;" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fforward.com%2Farticles%2F196952%2Fabraham-foxman-to-speak-at-boston-graduation-despi%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKRjljLhySVUhafaMD46QWYAGqWg" target="_blank">“is well deserving of recognition.”</a> Moreover, it is the University’s hope that Foxman’s “life of public service will inspire our graduates as they embark on their professional careers.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This does beg the question of what recognition the Syrian desert’s uncounted dead deserve, or what their lives may have inspired, but the answers are unlikely to be found in Foxman’s commencement speech.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">If you thought the “educator” who saw “racist” intent behind offering someone a peanut-butter sandwich was a loon, consider Western Washington University (WWU) president Bruce Shepard. Always on the lookout for ways to improve his institution’s academic integrity, he recently circulated a school-wide questionnaire and asked, “How do we make sure that in future years ‘we are not as white as we are today?’”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Apparently, Shepard has been gnashing his teeth over this problem for quite a while. As Kaitlyn Schallhorn at Campus Reform <a href="http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=5549" target="_blank">reports</a>, el presidente said in a 2012 speech, “Every year, from this stage and at this time, you have heard me say that, if in decades ahead, we are as white as we are today, we will have failed as university.”</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Hey, forget the old measures of academic success, such as if students know what’s in the Constitution, have a grasp of basic history and civics, can perform rudimentary mathematical calculations and properly use the language (for Shep’s benefit, I refer to English). It’s now all about melanin content.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And if you disagree with this thesis, then hope you’re just an ignorant rube. Because the alternative, according to el presidente, is far worse. As he wrote in a January <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/president/blog/posts/24.shtml" target="_blank">blog post</a>, if you disagree, you “have not thought through the implications of what is ahead for us or, more perniciously, assume we can continue unchanged.” Lions and tigers and pernicious! Oh, my! For graduates of WWU, in calling those who’ve thought things through but nonetheless cling to their misbegotten notions “pernicious,” Shep is accusing them of <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pernicious?s=t" target="_blank">being</a> “ruinous; injurious; hurtful.” Well, off to the re-education camp with you.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">And WWU’s got that covered: Campus Reform also tells us that el presidente has already junked “standard performance reviews” in favor of “sensitivity training and hosts workshops” to better serve illegal aliens. Hey, doubleplusgood for you, Shep.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But Shep is just looking to the future. He also warned on his blog, “In the decades ahead, should we be as white as we are today, we will be relentlessly driven toward mediocrity; or, become a sad shadow of our current self.” Would that be a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CeSUluBWrE" target="_blank">White Shadow</a>?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But I’m hip. We certainly wouldn’t want to be mediocre like the white guys who forged Western civilization, founded the US, created the modern world and gave us most of what makes our lives better.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Now, given that WWU was founded in 1886 and originally called the Northwest Normal School, I have a feeling it’s already a shadow of its former self. But, question: if WWU became what it is today while being intolerably white, how could remaining so make it a shadow of its current self? I know, I know, our strength lies in our diversity, our smartness lies in our stupidity, and academics lie constantly.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">But I have a couple more questions. Does Shep still want the mediocre white alumni’s money? And since WWU has printed information on how to more effectively “recruit and retain faculty and staff of color,” will the colorless Shepard lead by example and give his presidency to a member of the color replete? Or is this where, as with Elizabeth Fauxcahontas Warren, we suddenly learn that Shep is really a Cherokee named Peddling Bull.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Anyway, it’s not hard to figure out how to reduce the number of whites at WWU: just eliminate the affirmative action for whites.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Oh, wait….</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Alas, mediocrity may not remain restricted to WWU’s presidency after all.</p>

<p>When defending Western Civilization, some confuse that secular humanism, practiced as the current dominate popular culture, represents that lineage. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The decadence and decline in the West is undeniable. Yet the heritage upon which European civilization is based, owes a profound debt of gratitude to the societies that developed out of the brute force of empire and adopted principles of natural law and individual dignity. A direct correlation to the gospel of Christ becomes the centerpiece of this glorious tradition of universal brotherhood, that keeps man’s inhumanity to man in check.</p>
<p>The well-documented failures of institutions and regimes would have been far worse if left to the devices of pagan appetites or atheist’s hubris. However, the memory of the eternal struggle is short lived in the minds of most people. Confusion reigns because of a lack of knowledge, perspective and especially will, to admit that the New World Order is the invention of satanic factions that lust for control of the entire planet and beyond.</p>
<p>Therefore, the extraordinary essay by Pat Buchanan, <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/putin-vs-cultural-marxism-whose-side-is-god-on-now">Putin vs. Cultural Marxism: Whose Side Is God on Now?</a>, is a required penance for all those who have sinned.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In his Kremlin defense of <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-return-of-ethnic-nationalism-is-europe-cracking-up">Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea</a>, Russia is a Christian country, Putin was saying.This speech recalls last December&#8217;s address where the former KGB chief spoke of Russia as standing against a <a href="http://eng.news.kremlin.ru/news/6007/print">decadent West</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Many Euro-Atlantic countries have moved away from their roots, including Christian values. Policies are being pursued that place on the same level a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership, a faith in God and a belief in Satan. This is the path to degradation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With Marxism-Leninism a dead faith, Putin is saying the new ideological struggle is between a debauched West led by the United States and a traditionalist world Russia would be proud to lead.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Before dismissing Putin as just a KGB thug, read <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/061012.html">Vladimir Putin Nemesis of the New World Order</a>. Then do your own research on <a href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Karl_Marx.html">Marx</a> and <a href="http://www.jewwatch.com/jew-leaders-lenin.html">Lenin</a>’s clan of <a href="http://www.analysis-news.com/AnUnderstanding/Understanding-X.htm">Khazar Bolsheviks</a>. Finally, transcend the issue just about the motives of Putin and focus on the Christian roots of the Russian population.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfaturiortodoxe.ro/orthodox/orthodox_advices_seraphim_rose_american_orthodoxy.htm">The Orthodox Revival in Russia</a> by Fr. Seraphim Rose cites the experiences and significance of <a href="http://batr.org/view_/052902.html">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> and Father Dimitry Dudko.Solzhenitsyn spoke of Gulag—a secular term; Fr. Dimitry speaks of Golgotha—the Christian understanding of the Soviet experience. The central part of Fr. Dimitry&#8217;s—and contemporary Russia&#8217;s—message to us is that all the sufferings inflicted by atheism have a meaning—we can find Christ in them… Here are a few passages of Fr. Dimitry&#8217;s teaching:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In our land has occurred Golgotha; the torments of all the martyrs begin gradually to cleanse the air… The present crucifixion of Christ in Russia, the persecutions and mockings only lead to the resurrection of faith in men… This gives us strength, firmness, makes us better than we are now… Let us imagine the state of our martyrs. Did the thought of sinning occur to them at this moment? No matter what kind of sinners they may have been in this minute they become saints… And those who suffer for those condemned to death also become better. How many martyrs there have been in Russia—and therefore, how many holy feelings! Will these holy feelings really give no fruit? And perhaps we live and will live only by the feelings of the holy martyrs, being supported by them… In our country now is Golgotha. Christ is crucified. Golgotha is not merely sufferings, but such sufferings as lead to resurrection and enlighten men… Our time can be compared only with the first three centuries of Christianity, and perhaps then it was even easier; then they did not yet know all the refinements of subtle torture… If one compares the religious state here and in the West, the balance is on our side. Why? Because here we have Golgotha, and there they don&#8217;t. Does an abundance of material goods give a religious rebirth? … Here we have nothing, but if people believe they are ready to die for their faith.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fr. Rose provides his assessment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His truthfulness and fiery faith have made many enemies—sadly enough, even among Orthodox Christians. Some have found him too emotional, too apocalyptic, too messianic—and it is true that such a fiery, urgent, Orthodox preaching hasn&#8217;t been heard in Russia and probably the whole Orthodox world since the days of St. John of Kronstadt; many Orthodox people have become self-satisfied with their &#8220;correct and proper&#8221; Orthodoxy and are somehow offended when Orthodoxy is preached and communicated so warmly to everyone who will listen.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you just imagine such a discussion in the western media or even among Dispensationalist Christians, who are preoccupied in taking up the sword to champion Zionism? Any comparison between the West and Mother Russia would be incomplete without the insight of the audacious Brother Nathanael Kapner, <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=205">Putin’s Purge Of The Rothschild Money Changers</a>.In a televised Christmas message on January 7 2008 Putin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Russian Orthodox Church contributes to the promotion of moral values in society. One should not completely draw a line between the culture and the church. Of course by law in our country the church is separate from the state. But in the soul and the history of our people it’s all together. It always has been and always will be.&#8221; — <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/138/story_13827_1.html">Here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brother Nathanael leaves nothing unsaid in <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=84">PUTIN VS JEWS OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2006 <a href="http://www.twq.com/08spring/docs/08spring_gaddy.pdf">Putin had paid off Russia’s debt to the Rothschilds</a>. Russia’s financial dependence on the Jewish financiers was now over. Putin could then establish what became his <em>Russian Unity Party’s</em> 2007 <a href="http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2007/84/01.html">campaign slogan</a>: Putin’s Plan Means Victory For Russia! This slogan continues to make the<em> New World Order</em> Jews very nervous…<a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=198">Here</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While these sentiments are several years old, make no mistake about it, they are even truer today, with the efforts of the <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/040313.html">BRICS Development Bank to replace the IMF</a>.</p>
<p>For a more current description, look to Pastor Scott Lively in <a href="http://www.scottlively.net/2013/10/18/report-from-moscow/">Report from Moscow</a>, and a summary of a reversal of roles, read on.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Russia is today experiencing a Christian revival and is decidedly NOT communist. Some 30,000 churches have been built in the last year, and the ones in Moscow are reportedly overflowing with worshippers on Sundays. Most of the church is Orthodox, which is steeped in tradition, but at the same time relevant to the modern society.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;How incredibly ironic it is that Russia is now our best hope for stopping the conquest of the world by the &#8220;progressives.&#8221; On <a href="https://02varvara.wordpress.com/tag/fr-dmitri-smirnov/">Father Dimitri’s</a> television show, I made the point that the Americans and the Soviets both won and both lost the Cold War. The Americans broke the Soviet system through economic strategies and tactics. But before they collapsed, the Soviets poisoned the United States with Cultural Marxism, promoting moral degeneracy and family breakdown through so-called &#8220;progressive&#8221; ideology. Today, post-Soviet Russia is re-emerging as a Christian nation, while the United States is becoming a &#8220;Gay Soviet Union.&#8221; What a strange turn of events.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qzqnhj8W9Ac" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Echoing this conclusion is the report <a href="http://www.spc.rs/eng/russia_religious_revival_brings_new_life_orthodox_media">In Russia, a religious revival brings new life to Orthodox media</a>. &#8220;After 70 years of state-imposed atheism and 20 years that have run the gamut from glasnost to post-Soviet chaos to a revival of Russian pride, Russians have increasingly embraced their Orthodox roots.&#8221; The video <a href="http://youtu.be/qzqnhj8W9Ac">Christianity Grows in Russia &amp; Declines in the West</a> is to the point.The Latin Papacy has lost its spiritual way often over the millenniums and the Scofield Christian-Zionist apostate bible thumpers betray the Gospel of Christ with their devotion to the Talmud perversion of the Old Testament. Both need to seek repentance. Once the enemy of Christianity, when Russia was Rothschild’s USSR, today a revival of Christianity has started.</p>
<p>Western Secularism, which encapsulates the immoral ethos that underpins the globalist economic model, based upon a rejection of authentic Christian teaching, is the downfall of humanity.</p>
<p>If Russia can salvage their society from atheist communism, surely the West has the ability to humble themselves and repent for their depraved chutzpah and wicked ways. The <a href="http://www.batr.org/totalitariancollectivism/index.html">Totalitarian Collectivism</a> that has destroyed the Christian culture on both sides of the Atlantic must return to their traditional roots.</p>
<p>Michael Hoffman on ‘<a href="http://realcurrencies.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/meet-the-real-deal-michael-hoffman-on-usury-in-christendom/">Usury in Christendom</a>’ is essential, <em>‘…freedom from interest on money, is essentially the battle for freedom from the Money Power</em>’. The West has become the &#8220;Money Changers&#8221;, because the temple has subverted commerce by heretical destruction of faith and separation from God. By destroying traditional Christian religious belief, the secular body is defenseless. Such a message is radical to most, because it is reactionary to the spiritual non-believer.</p>
<p>Former Russian President <a href="http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2011/11/president-dmitry-medvedev-speaks-on.html">Dmitry Medvedev</a> has spoken of the &#8220;fruitfulness of cooperation between the Russian Orthodox Church and government and public institutions and called the revival of Orthodox Christianity in Russian in the past two decades a miracle.&#8221; The West needs a spiritual revival of its own conception. If the Russia Bear can be tamed, what prevents the American eagle from souring once again?</p>

</div>
<p>I just finished reading an article about how guns and munitions have become Israel&#8217;s most important export &#8212; and immediately I started thinking, &#8220;Hey, that is America&#8217;s most important <a href=" http://www.roitov.com/articles/crimea.htm">export too!</a>&#8221;   America and Israel now have so much in common.  No wonder AIPAC is so popular here and Israelis love Americans so much.  They are practically twins.</p>
<p>And how many other countries in the world today can make this claim:  &#8220;War is our most important product!&#8221;  I can&#8217;t think of a single one offhand.</p>
<p>But now let&#8217;s take this down a few notches &#8212; from the international level to the personal.  What if the best and most important thing that I could do with my own life right now is to manufacture and sell guns too?  Just call me the next Sarah Winchester!</p>
<p>Not to teach children, not grow crops, make music or create films, not be a religious, spiritual or moral person or even to manufacture trains, buttons or soap &#8212; screw all that pansy stuff.  Just to manufacture and sell weapons and guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;But mommy, we had guns for dinner last night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just shut up and bite the bullet, kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I go over and play with Jenny?  She&#8217;s got a new bike?&#8221;   No she doesn&#8217;t.  She&#8217;s got a new AK-47.</p>
<p>And what if a civil war started in America?  That&#8217;s totally possible.  And what if there was a civil war in Israel too &#8212; between its secular neo-cons and ultra-orthodox extremists?  Also totally possible.  Just think of all the profits that gun manufacturers would make from all that.  &#8220;War isn&#8217;t just for foreign countries any more!&#8221; could be their slogan.  A buck is a buck.</p>
<p>Never forget that Creativity is the very best antidote for War.</p>
<p>Both America and Israel seem to be addicted to war right now.  And this upside-down sicko attitude toward what is really important in life is going to kill off both countries (sooner or later) if they don&#8217;t watch out.  But creativity is the strongest antidote for war.  So let&#8217;s all help people get hooked on being creative instead of on being viscous, immoral and mean.</p>
<p>For one thing, creativity is a hecka lot more fun.  And for another, it doesn&#8217;t leave you with PTSD the morning after either.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you really rather have composed the &#8220;Ode to Joy&#8221; than to have brutally and senselessly slaughtered a million people in the Middle East?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/a6W2ZMpsxhg?feature=player_embedded" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/embed/<wbr></wbr>a6W2ZMpsxhg?feature=player_<wbr></wbr>embedded</a>  When I was a war correspondent in Iraq, I saw blood flowing from innocent bodies there &#8212; and, yes, I&#8217;m still bitter and pissed off about that.</p>
<p>How much nicer it would have been if I had been able to take a tour of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon instead.</p>

			<p><strong>It Must Start With You&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/colorful-change-3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>Wisconsin Representative <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/index.cfm/2014/2/house-judiciary-committee-reauthorizes-bipartisan-over-criminalization-task-force" target="_blank">Jim Sensenbrenner is chairman of a committee</a> that is attempting to reform our federal legal codes.  They state the problem this way:  “The United States Code currently contains some 4,500 federal crimes.  Recent studies estimate that approximately 60 new federal crimes are enacted each year, and over the past three decades, Congress has averaged 500 new crimes per decade.  In addition to the statutory criminal offenses, there are thousands of federal regulations that, if violated, can also result in criminal liability.  Some of these new statutes have been accompanied by hundreds of thousands of implementing regulations – studies put the number at more than 300,000 – many of which, if violated, can also result in criminal liability.”</p>
<p>A Florida court just sentenced a man to life in prison for a second offense of molesting a teen age girl.  Mandatory sentencing puts people in jail for twenty-five years for selling a marijuana cigarette to a friend.  Older teen agers who engage in sex play with teens under 16 are put on the Sex Offenders list and treated the way Lepers were during Biblical times.  Murderers often plea bargain for sentences less than those of sex offenders.   Our laws and our courts are in serious disarray.</p>
<p>A sixteen year old male who touches a fourteen year old female in the wrong place can be sentenced to a long prison term and placed on the dreaded sex offenders list for life. But two same sex homosexual seventeen year olds can engage in sodomy and more with impunity.  Human law quickly deteriorates into the unjust, anarchic, and often opposed opinions of those who code it.</p>
<p>We have allowed pornographers free reign while pushing mothers from the home and into the workplace leaving children at the mercy of lust filled citizens.  This has happened while our pulpits have provided us with expository preaching, music and praise. Though there is nothing wrong with expository preaching, music, and praise, but when the church is burning down sanity would attempt to put out the fine.</p>
<p>Our government through assassinations, destabilizations, and invasions has achieved hegemony over most of the nations of the world and has now successfully propagandized the them into believing the Russians have unilaterally invaded the Ukraine when the truth is that U. S. meddling created the situation.</p>
<p>We have allowed the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus, The Christ, to be eradicated from the public square because it is offensive to a small but powerful part of our population.  We have even gone so far as to claim we have a Judeo-Christian heritable when Judaism is the antithesis of Christianity; Islamic theology and Sharia law is actually closer to true Biblical doctrine than Judaism.</p>
<p>It is astounding that we still think we live in a free nation when obscure Federal legal standards are accompanied by state and local mandates that are not only despotic but far too numerous to be known and obeyed.</p>
<p>We have three different policing organizations in our state: local police, sheriff’s deputies, and state police.  When any law enforcement officer becomes involved with citizens some law is always violated and someone is sent to jail.  United States has a larger percentage of its citizens incarcerated than any other nation in the world.  Policemen use no discernment in the execution of their duties; instead they seek violations and then use their superior knowledge of the law to make arrests.</p>
<p>Justice is not an objective at either the arrest level or in the courts.</p>
<p>Though the death of policeman during performance of his duty receives a thousand times more attention than the death of a citizen who pays his salary; law enforcers are still losing respect.  This week in our town an 18 year old who violated probation and was living with his girl-friend in a mobile home was arrested by a swat team of 20 or more heavily armed officers accompanied by a bullet proof armored vehicle.  The excessive use of force is meant to scare the public into submission. In Virginia a young woman is <a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/latest-news/u-va-student-sues-state-abc-agents-for-million/article_5f19d8a8-b502-11e3-ba1e-001a4bcf6878.html" target="_blank">suing the State for $40 million</a> for a needless, vindictive arrest.</p>
<p>In a nearby town, a young policeman was shot by a teen age couple who following the incident both committed suicide. Suicide is becoming more and more common as law enforcers lose respect by flaunting power, making needless arrests and brutally treating citizens.</p>
<p>Were you aware, gentle reader, that it is legal for law enforcement officers to lie to you but it is illegal for you to lie to the police or to federal agents? Law enforcement may provide a measure of safety but it is too often a danger.   The deck is stacked and we are the mark!</p>
<p>Whenever a policeman is killed in the line of duty a massive propaganda campaign surrounds his funeral.  In spite of this effort the public is becoming wary.</p>
<p>Much of the disrespect for authority is a result of the state’s lack of moral standards.</p>
<p>We often think and write as if it is the responsibility of citizens to thwart the progress of the police state. Our thoughts center on the culpability of the pharisaical elite with little regard for our own responsibility.  We worship a sovereign God who created us and the universe in which we live; He is in control of what happens in His creation.  Our efforts to stem the tide of tyranny have been useless.</p>
<p>Confusion is a result of disobedience and the United States of America is overflowing with confusion.  Human reason buttressed with the cancer of diverse opinion has brought us to a place where cognitive dissonance is more common than logical order.  We live in a sea of lies, in a time when reality is obscure and fantasy prominent.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is popular with many who love liberty.  It is also popular with the one world order crowd.  Both deride national borders and are willing to see our land polluted by abominable behavior.</p>
<p>For decades Christians have been seeking remedial action through a debauched, imperialistic, fascist state.  The state will not reform until we reform!  If you, gentle reader, think that stoning a woman for adultery is worse than killed a hundred thousand with bombs, missiles, and contrived revolutions you are part of the problem.  We are created beings, our opinions must derive from the mandates of the One True Sovereign God; when they don’t we sin and suffer the confusion and tyranny that results.</p>
<p>When we ignore God and His Law we put ourselves in a position we were not created to fulfil.  We cannot play God.  We are unable to create a righteous legal system.  When a society allows its legal system to deteriorate to the condition the Sensenbrenner Committee is addressing that society is in serious trouble.  The Committee may remove some archaic laws from the code but result will be ineffective.  Man was created to live under God’s legal system and his efforts to construct his own system will come to naught.</p>
<p>Chris Hedges is at best a heretical Christian.  His father was a Reformed Pastor who apparently allowed his strong intellect to overcome the Truth.  Nevertheless, Hedges is confronting our mendacious era with the truth that every Christian pastor is sinfully omitting.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeDYrKnLDi8&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">Take time to listen here</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>All the attention over the epoch vote by Crimean’s to leave the Ukraine makes for a timely review of other separatist factions that are seeking a similar resolution. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_separatist_movements_in_Europe">List of active separatist movements in Europe</a> is exhaustive. The immediate impression is that a pervasive discontent, shared by legions of subjects, who want independence and self-determination, will be hard to derail. When European autocratic and aristocrats ruled, the only option was revolution. Today the descendants of the old regimes still wheeled power under the guise of democratically elected authorities. However, separatist sentiment does not mean the same to every splinter group.</p>
<p>Examine <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/europes-latest-secession-movement-venice/284562/">Europe&#8217;s Latest Secession Movement: Venice</a>, for a telling indicator.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;An organization representing a coalition of Venetian nationalist groups, held an unofficial referendum on breaking with Rome. Voters were first asked the main question -&#8221;Do you want Veneto to become an independent and sovereign federal republic?&#8221; -followed by three sub-questions on membership in the European Union, NATO, and the eurozone . . .</p>
<p>As the referendum&#8217;s organizers announced the results: 2,102,969 votes in favor of independence—a whopping 89 percent of all ballots cast—to 257,266 votes against. Venetians also said yes to joining NATO, the EU, and the eurozone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the significance of wanting to be part of NATO and the EU.</p>
<p>Next, look at the more widely reported effort, in the land of &#8220;Braveheart&#8221; William Wallace. <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/24/scottish-secession-remains-unlikely-but-momentum-is-with-the-schismatics/">Scottish secession remains unlikely, but momentum is with the schismatics</a> provides a more stately viewpoint from the Commonwealth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;After months of comfort for the pro-unionist ‘Better Together’ campaign, the most recent polls point to a tighter race with 40 percent of Scots supporting secession. With six months to go, the momentum appears to be with those seeking an amicable divorce.</p>
<p>Scottish independence would not lead to a republic. Queen Elizabeth II (I of Scotland) would remain head of state, a smart move by the ‘Yes’ campaign to de-radicalize independence and make the electorate feel more comfortable with a vote for change. The debate has therefore become more focused on incrementalism, with plans for an independent Scotland retaining both membership of NATO and the European Union, a common currency with the rest of the UK, and open borders.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uwkd9RHzWqU" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center></p>
<p>A video from the Carnegie Council gives a spin in <a href="http://youtu.be/uwkd9RHzWqU">Which Separatist Movements Will Succeed</a>, which plays down the urgent motivation for &#8220;FREEDOM&#8221; for an evolutionary approach.</p>
<p>An essay out of Wharton, <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/secession-answer-case-catalonia-flanders-scotland/">Is Secession the Answer? The Case of Catalonia, Flanders and Scotland</a>, points out the obvious, while illustrating the problematic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It may seem paradoxical in an age of global communications, but the revival of regionalism &#8220;is a global phenomenon,&#8221; notes Jacob Funk Kierkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C. think tank. Today’s high-speed technologies, including the Internet, &#8220;enable people to start a campaign and get out their message&#8221; quickly and repeatedly to like-minded people who might have harbored such desires in private.</p>
<p>Beyond its unique constitutional challenges, Catalonia faces another hurdle: The eurozone has a de facto veto over its independence. &#8220;If Catalonia becomes independent, will they [still] be part of the eurozone?&#8221; Kierkegaard asks, adding that, if Catalonia votes to secede, the EU response could be that &#8220;you will have to issue your own currency, and your banks will have no access to the European Central Bank. You won’t automatically have a seat on the ECB governing council.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/quv8lvW_2t4" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/01/spain-catalonia-independence">Spanish situation</a>, by contrast, the establishment would have you believe the militant Basques ETA nationalists harbor violent resolve. The YouTube <a href="http://youtu.be/quv8lvW_2t4">Thousands March In Spain In Support Of ETA</a>, reports that the EU labels this movement as terrorists. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-03-26/catalan-sovereignty-claim-blocked-by-spain-constitutional-court">Catalan Sovereignty Claim Blocked by Spain Constitutional Court</a>, is but a spillover effort to discredit the Catalonia’s claim. &#8220;Sovereignty is &#8220;not contemplated in our constitution for nationalities and regions that make up the state&#8221; and no one can break the principle of the &#8220;indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation,&#8221; the ruling said.Such illustrations, all exhibit unique local concerns and grievances, while sharing a basic distrust of national authority. What stands out is an anserine eagerness to remain part of the EU and NATO. This factor may be a distinctively European trait, which seems to be lacking in the proper understanding that the surrender of national authority to a body of central banksters, social technocrats and empire military mercenaries, is the fundamental cause of popular dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan in the article, <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2013/10/patrick-j-buchanan/secede-3/">Is Red State America Seceding?</a>, provides numerous other European examples of discontent, then goes on to cite secession initiatives in the United States. It is striking that our countries unique experience has a shape difference from the blue-blooded patricians’ clashes that mark the history of Europe. Because of this difference, the indigenous cultures on the continent have never developed the same passion of individual liberty, which is inborn in the American revolutionary spirit.</p>
<p>Applying the same principles defended in the View from the Mount essay, <a href="http://batr.org/view/111812.html">Secession Movement Ready to Take Hold</a>, would serve our European cousins well, in breaking up the EU and their NWO oppression.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Governments fall, while a consensual nation state can still survive. With the destruction of an accepted traditionalistic national identity, time-honored heritage becomes the target of dictatorial &#8220;do gooders&#8221; who facilitate subjugation of independent self-governing states.</p>
<p>Blowing out the candles of federal absolutism is the imperative of our age. Secession is not a dirty word, but is an indispensable solution. Dissolving the union of the suppressed, under the auspices of the subverted elite, is the path to social freedom and human liberty.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Libertarian and author <a href="http://www.lneilsmith.org/whoislns.html">L. Neil Smith</a> argues, &#8220;What happened in America in the 1860s was a war of secession, a war of independence, no different in principle from what happened in America in the 1770s and 1780s.&#8221; Compare most of the secession movements in the 21th century as half measure efforts that are not willing to take on the yoke of the globalist central banking financial system. The lessons presented in the Radical Reactionary article, <a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/081411.html">Representation, Secession and Taxation</a>, should be applied and adopted by the European secession movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As discontent rises and practical solutions evaporate, that dirty historic sentiment begins to bubble to the surface, SECESSION. <a href="http://lonestarwatchdog.blogspot.com/2011/08/secession-here-is-how-to-secede-from.html">Russell D. Longcore</a>　provides a standard, when secession is a vital and justified option that many would accept.&#8221;Secession should be solemnly deliberated by the elected representatives and the state citizens. Secession should be initiated at the moment that any state reaches the point at which it will no longer accept the despotic tyranny and laws coming from the US Federal Government in Washington, DC. Or, secession should be initiated upon a collapse of the Dollar, or the imposition by Washington DC of martial law in the event of social upheaval.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="secession2.jpg" src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/secession2.jpg" align="left" /><br />
Discontent is not enough to overthrow the tyrants, who have definitively proven, that a European Union based upon top down authoritarianism is a lawful substitute for locally ruled government based upon common ethics and cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The dramatic rise in opposition to the ruling elites is most encouraging in the eternal struggle against despotism. However, the European socialist welfare model has produced generations of soft stock and irresponsible subjects. Surrendering national sovereignty was the monumental failure of the post war era. Open borders to a confederation of dissimilar ethnic groups, attracts the disparate and incongruent, which builds even more pressure for secession.</p>
<p>As it stands today, the prospects for successful secession movements to attain their independence and autonomy are slim because each are fragmented. The correct and necessary element for separation, must be based upon, the dissolution of the European Union and the elimination of the central banking system, under the control of the international banksters.</p>
<p>Countries need to exercise their proper authority to coin their own currencies and maintain low taxation levels that fund minimum governmental functions.</p>
<p>While such a goal and objective is justified, the globalist controllers will not allow a serene exit from the monolith that they created. Marginal regional self-rule may eventually be reluctantly recognized, only if the basic leviathan structure remain intact and accepted by disgruntle camps. Notwithstanding, that approach can and will never bring about a restoration of national self-determination.</p>
<p>It is time for secession movements to unit and coalesce around a few fundamental principles, which they all share. The regional concerns are issues for local administration. Taking on the monster of globalist governance is a universal task.</p>
<p>Consequently, the undertaking domestically is to build ground swell defiance that moves past a modest grassroots opposition to incorporate the bulk of the rapidly declining middle class. This genuine moral majority must be willing to marginalize the federal government and restore the rightful authority of individual state jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If timid and docile Europeans are engaging in secession movements in such significant numbers, what is the excuse for industrious and energetic Americans from doing the same? This was the country for the home of the brave. Now is the time to restore that outlook with direct action.</p>

<p>It should be obvious that the recent putsch and regime change in the Ukraine inspired and backed by the U.S. shadow government, benefits the international banksters. For the average EU resident, only further economic displacement and diminished prospects can be expected from any inclusion of Ukraine into the EU dictatorial structure. Not so, for the corporatists who expects expanded opportunities as <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/03/16/corporate-interests-behind-ukraine-putsch/">Consortium News</a> analyzes agricultural and energy companies recent involvement within the Ukraine.While corporatists want to extend their monopolies, the appeal of joining the EU with privileges of travel, relocation and better employment, has a very high price tag. So what is really behind the cover that the Brussels technocrats like to provide for the heavy hand treatment, which the banksters always demand? Look to the methods of the IMF for part of the answer.</p>
<p>Michel Chossudovsky of Global Research, in the detailed essay <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/regime-change-in-ukraine-and-the-imfs-bitter-economic-medicine/5374877">Regime Change in Ukraine and the IMF’s Bitter &#8220;Economic Medicine&#8221;</a>, gives a comprehensive account of the handpicked players that are eager to do the bidding of the IMF.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shortly after his instatement, the interim (puppet) prime minister Arseny Yatsenyuk casually dismissed the need to negotiate with the IMF. Prior to the conduct of negotiations pertaining to a draft agreement, Yatsenyuk had already called for an unconditional acceptance of the IMF package: &#8220;We have no other choice but to accept the IMF offer&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explains the methods of the standard game plan that the IMF uses to impoverish the peasants and steal assets and resources.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While the privatization program ensures the transfer of State assets into the hands of foreign investors, the IMF program also includes provisions geared towards the destabilization of the country’s privately owned business conglomerates. A concurrent &#8220;break up&#8221; plan entitled &#8220;spin-off&#8221; as well as a &#8220;bankruptcy program&#8221; are often implemented with a view to triggering the liquidation, closing down or restructuring of a large number of nationally owned private and public enterprises.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the 21th Century Newswire reports that the <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2014/03/21/the-latest-heist-us-quietly-snatches-the-ukraines-gold-reserves/">US Quietly Snatches the Ukraine’s Gold Reserves</a> and corroborated by the same <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/ukraines-gold-reserves-secretely-flown-out-and-confiscated-by-the-new-york-federal-reserve/5373446">Prof Chossudovsky</a>, it becomes clear that economic conquest is a prime component behind the staged coup.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to reports out of Kiev, the US has quietly transfers 33 tons of Ukrainian gold out of the country and back to vaults in the US. Presumably, this sovereign wealth transfer would be counted as partial &#8220;collateral&#8221; for a fresh round of IMF, US FED, and ECB paper debt that is currently being organized for dumping into the Ukraine’s economic black hole.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Later a returned call from a senior official of the former Ministry of Revenue reported that tonight, on the orders of one of the new leaders of Ukraine, the United States had taken custody of all the gold reserves in Ukraine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, economist Michael Hudson in <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/03/ukraine-will-benefit-imf-bailout.html">Who In Ukraine Will Benefit From An IMF Bailout?</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The objective of IMF loans is to deindustrialize the economy. It is to force the economy–meaning the government when you say the economy–the government has to pay the IMF loan by privatizing whatever remains in the public domain. The Westerners want to buy the Ukrainian farmland. They want to buy the public utilities. They want to buy the roads. They want to buy the ports. And all of this is going to be sold at a very low price to the Westerners, and the price that the Westerners pay will be turned over to the Ukrainian government, that then will turn it back to the Ukraine. So whatever the West gives Ukraine will immediately be taken back.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Xc0wjU1gShE" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch the informative video, <a href="http://youtu.be/Xc0wjU1gShE">Who In Ukraine Will Benefit From An IMF Bailout?</a>, for the Real News assessment, that clarifies these developments. Now shift to the recent announcement that the <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/eu-russia-ukraine/25304480.html">EU Signs Association Agreement With Ukraine</a> for a viewpoint reported by Radio Free Europe.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This deal covers the most existential and most important issues, mainly security and defense cooperation,&#8221; Yatsenyukd said. &#8220;This deal will establish a joint decision-making body, which is to facilitate the process of real reforms in my country. And this deal meets the aspirations of millions of Ukrainians that want to be a part of the European Union.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What exactly can the EU offer by way of defense cooperation? Yes, this is the same central banker stooge, who the Wall Street Journal describes as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2014/02/27/washingtons-man-yatsenyuk-setting-ukraine-up-for-ruin/">Washington&#8217;s Man Yatsenyuk Setting Ukraine Up For Ruin</a>. Without the United States, the EU is a paper tiger. NATO is not an alliance, but a branch of outposts to deploy American troops. How does this phony agreement between the EU and Ukraine help the economic interests of either party?</p>
<p>Such a display of destitution only makes the illegitimate installed Ukraine government look like the vassal state that it has become. Bob Livingston over at <a href="http://personalliberty.com/2014/03/24/war-is-becoming-a-tough-sell/">Personal Liberty Digest</a> has it correct, &#8220;The Ukraine situation is a bankster-orchestrated crisis with the short game more money printing and the end game global governance.&#8221;The EU governance aspect is the eventual goal, but the immediate economic dislocation that even the talk of sanctions against Russia has, with the trading partners within the EU, surely will experience real pain. These conditions create the perfect storm for the IMF banksters to apply their vile craft.</p>
<p>Now that the Ukraine is reduced to beggar status, the gang of approved corporatist will feast like vultures upon the remains of fire sale assets. Once again the formula imposed upon Ireland, Spain and certainly <a href="http://batr.org/autonomy/110611.html">Greece</a>, will be used to guarantee the billions in EURO credit that will flow into the secret bank accounts of the new junta.</p>
<p>Capturing the Ukraine is more about geopolitical asset thievery than assimilation into the European Union. However, the EU marketed, as a lawful &#8220;community of nations&#8221; is nothing more than the political front for the money counterfeiters. Fashioning economic distress is the business of the unholy alliance. NATO, the IMF and the EU serve the shyster and shylock central banking system. Ukraine is just the latest victim.</p>

<p><em>As the US and EU apply sanctions on Russia over its annexation’ of Crimea, JP Sottile reveals the corporate annexation of Ukraine. For Cargill, Chevron, Monsanto, there’s a gold mine of profits to be made from agri-business and energy exploitation.</em></p>
<p>On 12th January 2014, a <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-ukraine-anti-government-protesters-stage-first-mass-rally-of-2014/1828480.html" target="_blank">reported 50,000 <em>“pro-Western”</em> Ukrainians</a>descended upon Kiev’s Independence Square to protest against the government of President Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>Stoked in part by <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/140112/ukraine-protests-swell-after-prominent-opposition-leaders-beatin" target="_blank">an attack on opposition leader Yuriy Lutsenko</a>, the protest marked the beginning of the end of Yanukovych’s four year-long government.</p>
<p>That same day, the <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8dde553c-7b92-11e3-84af-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2vmwKJHNH" target="_blank"><em>Financial Times</em>reported</a> a major deal for US agribusiness titan <strong>Cargill</strong>.</p>
<h4>Business confidence never faltered</h4>
<p>Despite the turmoil within Ukrainian politics after Yanukovych rejected a major trade deal with the European Union <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-ukraine-eu-idUSBRE9AK0S220131121" target="_blank">just seven weeks earlier</a>, Cargill was confident enough about the future to fork over $200 million to buy a stake in Ukraine’s UkrLandFarming.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, UkrLandFarming is the world’s eighth-largest land cultivator and <a title="Ukraine eggmaker's hard-boiled expansion plan — FT.com" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/591e3156-3d8e-11e3-9928-00144feab7de.html" target="_blank">second biggest egg producer</a>. And those aren’t the only eggs in Cargill’s increasingly ample basket.</p>
<p>On 13th December 2013, Cargill announced the <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/cargill-buys-stake-in-novorossiysk-port-to-boost-black-sea-presence/491486.html" target="_blank">purchase of a stake in a Black Sea grain terminal</a> at Novorossiysk on Russia’s Black Sea coast.</p>
<p>The port — to the east of Russia’s strategically and historically important Crimean naval base — gives them a major entry-point to Russian markets and adds them to the list of Big Ag companies <a href="http://www.agrimoney.com/news/cargill-extends-spree-of-black-sea-port-deals--6589.html" target="_blank">investing in ports around the Black Sea</a>, both in Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Cargill has been in Ukraine for <a href="http://www.cargill.com/worldwide/ukraine/" target="_blank">over two decades</a>, investing in grain elevators and acquiring a major <a href="http://www.cargill.com/feed/brands/provimi/" target="_blank">Ukrainian animal feed company</a> in 2011. And, based on its investment in UkrLandFarming, Cargill was decidedly confident amidst the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/europe/protests-continue-as-ukraine-leader-defends-stance-on-europe.html" target="_blank">post-EU deal chaos</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a stark juxtaposition to the alarm bells ringing out from the US media, bellicose politicians on Capitol Hill and perplexed policymakers in the White House.</p>
<h4>Instability?… What Instablility?</h4>
<p>It’s even starker when compared to the anxiety expressed by Morgan Williams, President and CEO of the <a href="http://www.usubc.org/site/" target="_blank">US-Ukraine Business Council</a> — which, according to its website, has been<em>“promoting US-Ukraine business relations since 1995.”</em></p>
<p>Williams was interviewed by the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/westerners-know-very-little-about-ukraine-qa-us-ukraine-business-council-president-1561143" target="_blank"><em>International Business Times</em></a> on March 13 and, despite Cargill’s demonstrated willingness to spend, he said, <em>“The instability has forced businesses to just go about their daily business and not make future plans for investment, expansion and hiring more employees.”</em></p>
<p>In fact, Williams, who does double-duty as Director of Government Affairs at the private equity firm <a href="http://www.sigmableyzer.com/" target="_blank">SigmaBleyzer</a>, claimed, <em>“Business plans have been at a standstill.”</em></p>
<p>Apparently, he wasn’t aware of Cargill’s investment, which is odd given the fact that he could’ve simply called Van A. Yeutter, Vice President for Corporate Affairs at Cargill, and asked him about his company’s quite active business plan.</p>
<p>There is little doubt Williams has the phone number because Mr. Yuetter serves on <a href="http://www.usubc.org/site/u-s-ukraine-business-council-usubc-executive-committee" target="_blank">the Executive Committee</a> of the selfsame US-Ukraine Business Council. It’s quite a cozy investment club, too.</p>
<p>According to his <a href="http://www.sigmableyzer.com/who-we-are/our-people/morgan-williams" target="_blank">SigmaBleyzer profile</a>, Williams <em>“started his work regarding Ukraine in 1992″</em> and has since advised American agribusinesses <em>“investing in the former Soviet Union.”</em> As an experienced fixer for Big Ag, he must be fairly friendly with the folks on the Executive Committee.</p>
<h4>Big Ag Luminaries — Monsanto, Eli Lilly, Dupont, John Deere…</h4>
<p>And what a committee it is — it’s a veritable who’s who of Big Ag. Among the luminaries working tirelessly and no doubt selflessly for a better, freer Ukraine are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Melissa Agustin, Director, International Government Affairs &amp; Trade for <strong>Monsanto</strong>;</li>
<li>Brigitte Dias Ferreira, Counsel, International Affairs for <strong>John Deere</strong>;</li>
<li>Steven Nadherny, Director, Institutional Relations for agriculture equipment-maker<strong>CNH Industrial</strong>;</li>
<li>Jeff Rowe, Regional Director for <strong>DuPont Pioneer</strong>;</li>
<li>John F. Steele, Director, International Affairs for <strong>Eli Lilly &amp; Company</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, Cargill’s Van A. Yeutter. But Cargill isn’t alone in their warm feelings toward Ukraine. As <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/24/monsanto-ukraine-idUSL5N0E51CM20130524" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a> in May 2013, Monsanto — the largest seed company in the world — plans to build a $140 million <em>“non-GM (genetically modified) corn seed plant in Ukraine.”</em></p>
<p>And right after the decision on the EU trade deal, Jesus Madrazo, Monsanto’s Vice President for Corporate Engagement, <a href="http://monsantoblog.com/2013/12/19/monsanto-and-its-commitment-to-ukraine/" target="_blank">reaffirmed</a> his company’s <em>“commitment to Ukraine”</em>and <em>“the importance of creating a favorable environment that encourages innovation and fosters the continued development of agriculture.”</em></p>
<p>Monsanto’s strategy includes a little <em>“hearts and minds”</em> public relations, too. On the heels of Mr. Madrazo’s reaffirmation, <a href="http://monsantoblog.com/2013/12/13/monsanto-ukraine-launching-social-development-program/" target="_blank">Monsanto announced</a> <em>“a social development program titled ‘Grain Basket of the Future’ to help rural villagers in the country improve their quality of life.”</em></p>
<p>The initiative will dole out grants of up to $25,000 to develop programs providing<em>“educational opportunities, community empowerment, or small business development.”</em></p>
<h4>Immense Economic Importance</h4>
<p>The well-crafted moniker ‘Grain Basket of the Future’ is telling because, once upon a time, Ukraine was known as ‘the breadbasket’ of the Soviet Union. The <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html" target="_blank">CIA ranks</a> Soviet-era Ukraine second only to Mother Russia as the <em>“most economically important component of the former Soviet Union.”</em></p>
<p>In many ways, the farmland of Ukraine was the backbone of the USSR. Its fertile black soil generated over a quarter of the USSR’s agriculture. It exported substantial quantities of food to other republics and its farms generated four times the output of the next-ranking republic.</p>
<p>Although Ukraine’s agricultural output plummeted in the first decade after the break-up of the Soviet Union, the farming sector has been growing spectacularly in recent years.</p>
<p>While Europe struggled to shake-off the Great Recession, Ukraine’s agriculture sector grew 13.7% in 2013.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s agriculture economy is hot. Russia’s is not. Hampered by the effects of <a href="http://www.fwi.co.uk/articles/09/12/2013/142338/the-future-of-farming-in-russia.htm" target="_blank">climate change</a> and <a href="http://www.fwi.co.uk/articles/09/12/2013/142338/the-future-of-farming-in-russia.htm" target="_blank">25 million hectares</a> of uncultivated agricultural land, Russia lags behind its former breadbasket.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2014-02-07/transformation-agriculture-ukraine-collective-farms-to" target="_blank">According to the Centre for Eastern Studies</a>, Ukraine’s agricultural exports rose from $4.3 billion in 2005 to $17.9 billion in 2012 and, harkening the heyday of the USSR, farming currently accounts for 25% of its total exports. Ukraine is also the world’s third-largest exporter of wheat and of corn. And corn is not just food. It is also ethanol.</p>
<h4>Feeding Europe</h4>
<p>But people gotta eat — particularly in Europe. As Frank Holmes of US Global Investors<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-is-quickly-becoming-the-breadbasket-of-europe-2011-2" target="_blank">assessed in 2011</a>, Ukraine is poised to become Europe’s butcher. Meat is difficult to ship, but Ukraine is perfectly located to satiate Europe’s hunger.</p>
<p>Just two days after Cargill bought into UkrLandFarming, <em>Global Meat News</em> <a href="http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Industry-Markets/Ukraine-forecasts-significant-rise-in-meat-exports" target="_blank">reported a huge forecasted spike</a> in <em>“all kinds”</em> of Ukrainian meat exports, with an increase of 8.1% overall and staggering 71.4% spike in pork exports.</p>
<p>No wonder Eli Lilly is represented on the US-Ukraine Business Council’s Executive Committee. Its <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/13/usa-elanco-price-increase-idUSL2N0IY23320131113" target="_blank">Elanco Animal Health unit</a> is a major manufacturer of feed supplements.</p>
<p>And it is also notable that Monsanto’s planned seed plant is non-GMO, perhaps anticipating an emerging GMO-unfriendly European market and Europe’s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/13/organic-food-drink-sale" target="_blank">growing appetite</a> for organic foods. When it comes to Big Ag’s profitable future in Europe, the stakes couldn’t be higher.</p>
<h4>A Long String of Russian Losses</h4>
<p>For Russia and its hampered farming economy, it’s another in a long string of losses to US encroachment — from NATO expansion into Eastern Europe to US military presence to its south and onto a major shale gas development deal recently signed by Chevron in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So, why was Big Ag so bullish on Ukraine, even in the face of so much uncertainty and the predictable reaction by Russia?</p>
<p>The answer is that the seeds of Ukraine’s turn from Russia have been sown for the last two decades by the persistent Cold War alliance between corporations and foreign policy. It’s a version of the ‘<a href="http://billmoyers.com/episode/the-deep-state-hiding-in-plain-sight/" target="_blank">Deep State</a>‘ that is usually associated with the oil and defense industries, but also exists in America’s other heavily subsidized industry — agriculture.</p>
<p>Morgan Williams is at the nexus of Big Ag’s alliance with US foreign policy. To wit,<a href="http://www.sigmableyzer.com/who-we-are/our-people/morgan-williams" target="_blank">SigmaBleyzer touts</a> Mr. Williams’ work with <em>“various agencies of the US government, members of Congress, congressional committees, the Embassy of Ukraine to the US, international financial institutions, think tanks and other organizations on US-Ukraine business, trade, investment and economic development issues.”</em></p>
<h4>Freedom — For US Business</h4>
<p>As President of the US-Ukraine Business Council, Williams has access to Council cohort — David Kramer, President of <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/country/ukraine#.UyM09ye57dI" target="_blank">Freedom House</a>. Officially a non-governmental organization, it has been <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/ngo432.doc.htm" target="_blank">linked</a> with overt and <a href="http://exiledonline.com/wikileaks-expose-kochs-neocons-and-covert-regime-change-ops/" target="_blank">covert ‘democracy’ efforts</a> in places where the door isn’t open to American interests — aka US corporations.</p>
<p>Freedom House, the National Endowment for Democracy and National Democratic Institute <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa" target="_blank">helped fund and support</a> the Ukrainian ‘Orange Revolution’ in 2004. Freedom House is <a href="http://www.activistcash.com/organizations/503-freedom-house/" target="_blank">funded directly</a> by the US Government, the National Endowment for Democracy and the US Department of State.</p>
<p>David Kramer is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs and, according to his <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/content/kramer-david-j#.UyM-hye57dI" target="_blank">Freedom House bio page</a>, formerly a Senior Fellow at <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Project_for_the_New_American_Century" target="_blank">the Project for the New American Century</a>.</p>
<h4>Nuland’s $5 Billion For Ukrainian ‘Democracy’</h4>
<p>That puts Kramer and, by one degree of separation, Big Ag fixer Morgan Williams in the company of PNAC co-founder Robert Kagan who, as coincidence would have it, is married to Victoria <em>“F*ck the EU”</em> Nuland, the current Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Ms. Nuland spoke to the US-Ukrainian Foundation last 13th December, <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/2013/dec/218804.htm" target="_blank">extolling the virtues</a> of the <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/euromaidan-dark-shadows-far-right-ukraine-protests-1556654" target="_blank">Euromaidan</a> movement as the embodiment of <em>“the principles and values that are the cornerstones for all free democracies.”</em></p>
<p>Nuland also told the group that the United States had invested more than $5 billion in support of Ukraine’s <em>“European aspirations”</em> — meaning pulling Ukraine away from Russia. She made her remarks on a dais featuring a backdrop emblazoned with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y0y-JUsPTU" target="_blank">a Chevron logo</a>.</p>
<p>Also, her colleague and phone call buddy US <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2325091/ukraine_chevron_condi_rice_and_shale_gas_join_the_dots.html" target="_blank">Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt helped Chevron</a> cook up their 50-year shale gas deal right in Russia’s kitchen.</p>
<h4>Coca-Cola, Exxon-Mobil, Raytheon</h4>
<p>Although Chevron sponsored that event, it is <a href="http://www.usukraine.org/funders2011.shtml" target="_blank">not listed as a supporter</a> of the Foundation. But the Foundation does list the <strong>Coca-Cola Company</strong>, <strong>ExxonMobil</strong> and <strong>Raytheon</strong> as major sponsors. And, to close the circle of influence, the US-Ukraine Business Council is also listed as a supporter.</p>
<p>Which brings the story back to Big Ag’s fixer — Morgan Williams.</p>
<p>Although he was glum about the current state of investment in Ukraine, he’s gotta wear shades when he looks into the future. He told <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/westerners-know-very-little-about-ukraine-qa-us-ukraine-business-council-president-1561143" target="_blank">the <em>International Business Times</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The potential here for agriculture / agribusiness is amazing … Production here could double. The world needs the food Ukraine could produce in the future. Ukraine’s agriculture could be a real gold mine.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, his priority is to ensure that the bread of well-connected businesses gets lavishly buttered in Russia’s former breadbasket. And there is no better connected group of Ukraine-interested corporations than <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304585004579417523345324430" target="_blank">American agribusiness</a>.</p>
<p>Given the extent of US official involvement in Ukrainian politics — including the interesting fact that Ambassador Pyatt <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/pyatt-us-agencies-assisting-ukraine-in-yanukovych-corruption-investigation-338953.html" target="_blank">pledged US assistance</a> to the new government in investigating and rooting-out corruption — Cargill’s seemingly risky investment strategy probably wasn’t that risky, after all.</p>

<p>ATF agents raided a gun parts store over the weekend to obtain a customer list.</p>
<p>The raid began after Dimitri Karras, the owner of <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/03/17/despite-restraining-order-atf-raids-ares-armory-over-plastic-parts-n1810321" target="_blank">Ares Armor</a>, in National City, Calif., refused to turn the customer list over to the federal government as demanded. A retired Marine, Karras said agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) wanted to investigate a list of 5,000 customers who unknowingly had purchased an allegedly illegal part at the store.</p>
<p>The customers reportedly purchased a specific 80 percent <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/03/17/feds-work-around-restraining-order-to-execute-search-warrant-on-gun-parts-store/" target="_blank">lower receiver</a> — used to build an <a href="http://www.offthegridnews.com/2014/02/27/get-legal-new-ways-to-modify-your-ar-15/" target="_blank">AR-15</a> rifle – that the Department of Justice and the ATF contend is illegal because it does not have a serial number.</p>
<p>Ares Armor was among a handful of stores which recently received a letter from ATF agents demanding that they not only turn the non-compliant gun part over to the federal government, but provide the names of all customers who bought the item as well.</p>
<p>Karras’ attorney asked for and received a temporary restraining order against the ATF from a federal judge, Janis L. Sammartino, who was nominated by President George W. Bush. A preliminary hearing is scheduled to review the situation on March 20.</p>
<p><center></center>But on Saturday the ATF agents did break in and enter Karras’ gun parts store, which was closed at the time. They walked out with several boxes of files. Federal attorneys had obtained a judicial “ex parte order,” which allowed them to search the store as long as no one was there. Sammartino had issued that, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Karras previously had said federal officials had told him to turn over the files “or we are coming in and taking pretty much anything.”</p>
<p>“Which is a huge privacy concern and something we are not willing to do,” he had said. “They were going to search all of our facilities and confiscate our computer and pretty much shut our business down. The government invades our privacy on a daily basis and everyone thinks it’s okay. This is one of those situations where hopefully the government institutions come in and say, ‘This is protected and you’re not taking it from them.’”</p>

<p>During the Saturday ATF raid on Ares Armor, the agent converged upon the store in full tactical gear and confiscated the remaining AR-lower receivers. Just prior to the raid, both plain clothes and undercover ATF agents reportedly questioned customers outside of the California gun store.</p>
<p>The customers who purchased the part likely will be contacted by federal officials soon.</p>
<p>“If you have purchased an 80% lower receiver from a storefront location or over the Internet from any vendor, I think it is safe to assume that the federal government either has your customer data, or is in the process of trying to obtain your customer data,” wrote BearingArms.com editor Bob Owens.<b> </b>“If you want a truly anonymous 80% lower, pay cash via a private sale, the same as you would with a serialized firearm.</p>

<p>“We have to wonder if this raid wasn’t as much an attempt to send a message to 80% lower customers as it was a raid for user data. Perhaps they’re attempting to scare people away from buying from these companies, so that they go out of business.”</p>

<p>The psychopathic propaganda power brokers are inciting hysteria over expanding their Ukrainian coup operation. Pushing Russia to accept a hostile empire on their border is irrational. Belligerence and intimidation makes indefensible foreign affairs relationships. Those who swallow the &#8220;wag the dog&#8221; script that circulates in the Western mainstream media, deceived or brainwashed, are incapable of any independent thought. The forces that seek unremitting interventionist intrusions that thrive on self-induced chaos are the true threats to world peace.</p>
<p>Until the perception and experience of the intrepid Michael Scheuer becomes universally accepted, the failed foreign policy mistakes will continue as seen in <a href="http://non-intervention.com/1181/russia-annexing-crimea-is-the-cost-of-u-s-eu-intervention-in-ukraine/">Russia annexing Crimea is the cost of U.S.-EU intervention in Ukraine</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Overall, U.S. and Western leaders should be lining up to thank Vladimir Putin for a painful but thorough lesson in how the adult leader of a nation protects his country’s genuine national interests. And, it must be noted, Putin is not teaching rocket science. Had Western leaders received a decent education — especially in the fields of history and human nature — they would have been absolutely certain from the start that any destabilizing Western intervention in Ukraine that even remotely threatened Russia’s assured access to its Crimean naval bases would provoke precisely the kind of Russian response that occurred. They also would have known that West and the UN could bleat forever about the requirements of various treaties and international law, but that a nation acting to protect what it perceives to be life-or-death national interests — as is Putin’s Russia — is both insane and suicidal if it refrains from acting because of a raft of documents designed to address Cold War conditions that no longer exist.</p>
<p>The lesson of the Ukraine crisis — if it ends without war — for the U.S. and the EU will be crystal clear: Hoe your own row, and mind your own business. If it ends in a civil or European war, they will have only themselves to blame.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>With the results from the Crimean referendum in hand the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/crimea-referendum-explainer-ukraine-russia">Guardian</a> newspaper reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The referendum ballot itself, as posted a few days ago to the parliament&#8217;s website, doesn&#8217;t exactly give voters an option to say &#8220;No&#8221;. The two choices are:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you support joining Crimea with the Russian Federation as a subject of Russia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you support restoration of the 1992 Crimean constitution, and Crimea&#8217;s status as part of Ukraine?</p></blockquote>
<p>This second option is somewhat contradictory: the 1992 constitution asserts Crimea is an independent state and not part of Ukraine (reference to autonomy within Ukraine was inserted at a later date). By &#8220;supporting the restoration of the 1992 constitution&#8221; voters will actually support enhanced autonomy. No matter what, voters are ticking a box for independence from Ukraine.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the inimitable and immortal words of that heroine of all <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/03/13/3094109/apnewsbreak-transgender-troop.html">transgender</a> sociopaths, the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton sums up the double standard: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka0_nz53CcM">What Difference Does It Make?</a> The bipartisan support for an unbalanced death wish to jump-start the DEFCON alert level, reflected in the comments of <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/gen-dempsey-us-ready-for-military-response-to-russia-if-crimean-conflict-escalates-339144.html">General Dempsey: US ready for military response to Russia if Crimean conflict escalates</a>, should alarm everyone. “We do have treaty obligations with our NATO allies. And I have assured them that if that treaty obligation is triggered [in Europe], we would respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a listing of reports on Lessons of the Ukrainian Coup, examine the latest <a href="http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=1f36c52155dbd59aea0b01d76&amp;id=2816c363ed&amp;e=ed5705a7ca">BATR RealPolitik Newsletter &#8211; March 13, 2014</a>. Especially appreciate the Robert Parry article, <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/02/23/neocons-and-the-ukraine-coup/">Neocons and the Ukraine Coup</a>, which targets the perverse mentality of the NeoCon influence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now, you have Assistant Secretary of State Nuland, the wife of prominent neocon Robert Kagan, acting as a leading instigator in the Ukrainian unrest, explicitly seeking to pry the country out of the Russian orbit. Last December, she reminded Ukrainian business leaders that, to help Ukraine achieve “its European aspirations, we have invested more than $5 billion.” She said the U.S. goal was to take “Ukraine into the future that it deserves.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Any attempt to establish sanity in foreign policy must recognize that the betrayers within have sold out America for the last century. Foggy Bottom is the depository of dual loyalists as explained in the Totalitarian Collectivism essay, <a href="http://consortiumnews.com/2014/02/23/neocons-and-the-ukraine-coup/">The State Department&#8217;s New World Order Agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Just who are the maniacal lunatics that drive this insatiable need to threaten continuous war to achieve global imperium? One needs not be a Putin booster to recognize that the post 911 expansions of a garrison mentality guarantees further military expeditions into the internal affairs of any country that bucks the “international community” New World Order goals.</p>

<p>Author of the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-American-Empire-Rodrigue-Tremblay/dp/0741418878/ref=sr_11_1/104-8428100-2298348?ie=UTF8">The New American Empire</a>”, Rodrigue Tremblay exposes the lunacy behind <a href="http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2014/03/06/the-bush-obama-s-neocon-foreign-policy-o">The Bush-Obama&#8217;s Neocon Foreign Policy of Isolating Russia and of Expanding NATO is a Dismal Failure</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“President Barack Obama was candid in admitting it on Monday March 3, 2014, when he said that &#8220;we are indicating to the Russians [that] if in fact they continue on the current trajectory they’re on, then we are examining a whole series of steps — economic, diplomatic— that will isolate Russia.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it is precisely this desire to expand NATO and to isolate Russia by incorporating all the countries bordering Russia into NATO, i.e. a strategy of geopolitical and military encirclement of Russia, which has provoked that country when it felt threatened in its national security.</p>
<p>The truth is that NATO should have been disbanded after the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991, and especially after the Warsaw Pact was itself dismantled . . . But no! The United States wanted to take advantage of the situation and demanded that everything fell into the military-financial U.S. Empire.”</p>
<p>The Global Gulag essay, <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/021203.html">NATO a Dinosaur Overdue for Extinction</a>, amplifies upon this conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the breakdown in NATO is destined to avail an opportunity to curtail the Yankee Hyperpower, the alternative need not be the formation of another suspect alliance. It is not unpatriotic to advocate the wisdom in an America First policy. NATO doesn’t secure an advance for our country, but only provides the military command and enforcement that imposes the will of global masters. Resistance and opposition against an independent EU rapid defense force, comes not from the nations of Europe, but from the elites that control the mechanisms of global power. NATO is one of their tools. Alliances are one of their methods. And suppression of viable self determination is their cherished goal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Just think what the response would be if Putin reacted to the bellicose threats from EU/NATO/US to intervene into whatever geographic Ukraine composition remains, by re-creating Russian bases in the Western hemisphere? Venezuela becoming the 21th Century Cuba cannot stand. You can hear the cries – no Russian Guantánamo Bay bases in our backyard.</p>
<p>The impotency of superpower status means that the nuclear option becomes executable. This attitude is pure madness, and leads to unilateral imperialism.</p>
<p>When the formidable voice of moral authority, Paul Craig Roberts, warns about <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/03/14/world-war-1-paul-craig-roberts/">World War 1 All Over Again</a>, the nation must come to grips with the fact that the establishment political class is hell bent on running the world by whatever means they decide as they undertake to eliminate any and all opposition to their brinkmanship of NWO jingoism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did US Secretary of State John Kerry ask you before he delivered an all or nothing ultimatum to Russia? Did he ask Congress? Did he ask the countries of western and eastern Europe–NATO members who Kerry has committed to whatever the consequences will be of Washington’s inflexible, arrogant, aggressive provocation of Russia, a well-armed nuclear power? Did Kerry ask Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico, South America, Africa, China, Central Asia, all of whom would be adversely affected by a world war provoked by the crazed criminals in Washington?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Absent from a sober and balanced national policy, on what is truly best for the American people, is recognition that the internationalism fostered by Woodrow Wilson has destroyed the Republic. <a href="http://batr.org/americafirst.html">America First</a> requires the acceptance and courage to admit that the globalist coup d&#8217;état, which actually took over and now rules our own country, is the definitive enemy of all humanity.</p>
<p>The treason of the NeoCons and International Libs promote a satanic cosmology, which seeks to destroy any traditional institutional legacy that George Washington elaborated in his <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp">Farewell Address</a>. Risking World War III over Ukraine, especially when the forces of globalism initiated the unrest, is sheer folly.</p>
<p>If there are any real Patriots left in positions of authority within the Federal government, is it now time to enlist in the much-needed second American Revolution? Liberate our own country before starting conflicts that will only result in an existential demise of our nation. The American holocaust planned from within and exercised by commands from traitors is the real reign of terror that faces every truehearted citizen.</p>
<p>An empire necessitates the elimination of the Republic. If Crimea can hold a referendum, only the NWO Jacobins deny the same option for us.</p>

<p><i>Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.</i> ~ Eph 5:11</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the movie “Son of God” has created quite a stir in the Christian community.  Before I gave the theater my money I read several reviews, blog posts, Facebook comments and viewed TV interviews of husband and wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey promoting their film.  Roma is a familiar face to many and is best-known for her role on the successful TV show “Touched by An Angel.”  Mark Burnett is the executive producer of a string of hit TV shows such as &#8220;Survivor,&#8221; &#8220;The Voice, “Celebrity Apprentice,&#8221; &#8220;Shark Tank,&#8221; and he has won several Emmys.</p>
<p>When I first heard that another full-length feature film about the life of Christ was coming to the silver screen, I was skeptical for several reasons.  First, Mark and Roma are <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fproclaimingthegospel.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFC3frvRKIQF9SC4yqvYBlZF-DJFw" target="_blank">Catholic</a> and I was concerned that the movie would be produced from this perspective; a perspective that in many cases I disagree with.</p>
<p>Second, I learned that Roma earned a degree in “spiritual psychology” from the University of Santa Monica, a private graduate school founded by New Age spiritual and self-help quack John-Roger.   P.J. Miller is not being flippant when he asks:</p>
<p><i>What do you call someone who is a student of new age psychology and spiritualism? Do you call them new agers? Do you call them seekers? Would you dare call them Christian? Well, if you’re Roma Downey, then yes, you would call yourself all the above. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpjmiller.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F02%2F20%2Froma-downey-and-mark-burnetts-son-of-god-film%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgZWzUvSSuonF-KhRyFE76zVKmtg" target="_blank">Source</a>)</i></p>
<p>Third, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcIXCok9HPg" target="_blank">movie trailer</a> shows Jesus asking Peter to follow Him. Peter looks skeptical and asks Jesus what they’re going to do.  Jesus grins and replies “Change the world.&#8221;  Well, no.  Jesus never said those words to Peter!  Here’s what Jesus actually said:</p>
<p><i>While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</i><i> And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”<sup><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></sup>Immediately they left their nets and followed him. </i>(Mat 4:18-20)</p>
<p>Jesus <i>commanded</i>  &#8211; Peter and Andrew dropped what they were doing to follow Him.  (More on this in a moment.)  Another clip shows a woman sitting in a boat on the Sea of Galilee with Jesus and the apostles during the storm where Jesus walks on water.  But according to Scripture there was no woman in the boat:</p>
<p><i>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.  </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F14.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQMifrWgBs3o8e0MX5YlB1nLJO6g" target="_blank">Mat 14:22</a>) <i></i></p>
<p>In the movie Mary was the woman in the boat.  But why would they have a woman in the boat when Matthew informs us that the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gotquestions.org%2Ftwelve-apostles-disciples-12.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHKds39cg97GDWLIkhPjBmgEvhiw" target="_blank">disciples/apostles</a> got into the boat.  Mary wasn’t one of the twelve disciples/apostles – no woman was!</p>
<p>Finally, S. Michael Houdmann revealed in his review of the movie that, “the reason for Jesus&#8217; death and the meaning of His resurrection are completely missing. The fact that Jesus&#8217; death is the atoning sacrifice for sin is not mentioned at all (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2F1%2520John%25202.2&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG905IHhqX4ANXW8h2rFEl3ybcB-A" target="_blank">1 John 2:2</a>).”</p>
<p>As I said, “Son of God” has elicited a great deal of controversy as did Mark and Roma’s “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.com%2Fshows%2Fthe-bible%2Fvideos%3Fmkwid%3DsSPL82MEx%257Cc_pcrid_38422039518_pkw_the%2520bible%2520miniseries_pmt_b%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_term%3Dthe%2520bible%2520miniseries%26utm_campaign%3DG_The%2BBible%26paidlink%3D1%26cmpid%3DPaidSearch_google_G_The%2BBible_&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFELoDt1jPlNQ5AsvmarGeUJWHSSA" target="_blank">The Bible</a>” miniseries produced by <i>LightWorkers Media</i>, a company owned by them. This “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunnyshell.org%2F2013%2F03%2Fhistory-channels-bible-exalts-man-over_4.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNENGZsv0GJfi2VStlvgqd5IX4qefA" target="_blank">heretical and blasphemous</a>” program aired on the History Channel last year. &#8220;We knew when we were shooting,” said Downey, “that the Jesus portion of our &#8216;Bible&#8217; series was special and we shot much more footage and we&#8217;ve re-edited many more scenes into a stand-alone feature film called &#8216;Son of God.&#8217;&#8221;   I don’t have the space to tackle the “The Bible” brouhaha.  I will say, though, that several highly controversial pastors sat on the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbibleseriesresources.com%2Fboard-of-advisors&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF58IDJY5UUlo7Sr0ZN7tr0PkvRnQ" target="_blank">Board of Advisors</a>.

<p><b>The Son of God?</b></p>
<p>“Son of God” opened on February 28, so by now a lot of folks have had the opportunity to view it in theatres and many more will have it streaming into their living rooms in a few months.  Naturally, reviews were quickly written, some good, some not so good.  (You’ll find links to the reviews at the end of this piece.) Suffice to say that in a short amount of time a lot has been said about the film.</p>
<p>Many of you won’t be surprised to learn that Mark and Roma asked Saddleback Church founder Rick Warren to help spread their version of the “good news.”   He happily agreed.  “I&#8217;ve seen most of the films produced about Jesus in the past 50 years,” said the pastor, “and ‘Son of God’ is the best.  We&#8217;re excited Jesus is back on the big screen, and we&#8217;re going to fill the theaters. I want every other faith leader in America to do the same.”</p>
<p>So – why would the man who is affectionately called “America’s Pastor” agree to promote a film that its critics describe as outright unbiblical?</p>
<p>Not only did Warren endorse the film, according to the <em>Baptist Standard</em> staff report :</p>
<p>Pastor and author Rick Warren partnered with LifeWay Christian Resources to release a Bible study related to the <em>Son of God</em> movie from 20th Century Fox, which hits theaters Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The small-group curriculum resource by Warren, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifeway.com%2FProduct%2Fson-of-god-the-life-of-jesus-in-you-leader-kit-p005683781&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEcgHScltwfKoVSrmkrNSALmULXSA" target="_blank"><em>Son of God: The Life of Jesus in You</em></a>, is a companion piece to the movie produced by husband-and-wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey.</p>
<p>The six-session study features video clips from the movie and videos from Warren explaining Jesus’ teachings and their impact on people’s lives. Topics include baptism, temptation, suffering, death, resurrection and ministry. (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.baptiststandard.com%2Fnews%2Fbaptist%2F16135-baptist-briefs-son-of-god-film-study-materials&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe5Hn8F-yRqcWl1o5LUyhycE_kmA" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>As a Southern Baptist preacher, Rick Warren knows perfectly well that the Roman Catholic Church holds to the view that it is the one true Church.  Thus, any church outside the RCC is anathematized (excommunicated, cursed or damned). The Protestant Reformers held the view that the RCC’s gospel is not a gospel that saves; therefore the RCC is apostate.  Anyone who rejects the true gospel – we are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone – is an unbeliever.  Period.  Warren also knows what the Bible teaches regarding believers going into <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F110124&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHiF_q_2AwTLQ4sDLs1yW7u9WlT7Q" target="_blank">partnerships with unbelievers</a>:</p>
<p><i>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_corinthians%2F6.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMAY0VmYFOOkoqEQo2lwys2YH5dQ" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>)</p>
<p>Here’s the thing.  Not everyone who professes the name of Christ has a true saving faith.  What about Mark Burnett and Roma Downey?  Do they have a true saving faith?  Let’s examine the fruit.</p>
<p><b>Endorsements</b></p>
<p>Popular pastor and author Mark Driscoll’s church bought out 3,500 seats.  In 2013 he and his wife shared a stage with Mark and Roma at Resurgence 13.  Driscoll later remarked:</p>
<p><i>We watched the world premier trailer for</i><em> </em><i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonofgodmovie.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-fkG9dZ52XXs5GpGYJ54MvuRECQ" target="_blank">The Son of God</a> at the conference, and the footage choked me up as I thought of the millions of people who will hear about Jesus through this project. I am so encouraged by God’s work through this couple. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftheresurgence.com%2F2013%2F11%2F07%2Fson-of-god-mark-burnett-roma-downey-at-r13&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5IaLbzfvROoRWgJK81bKNGWfuYA" target="_blank">Source</a>)<i></i></p>
<p>God’s work?</p>
<p><i>The connection between the Passover sacrifice (Exodus 12) and Jesus as the Lamb of God (</i><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblia.com%2Fbible%2Fesv%2FJohn%25201.29&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNETeolXbTfLhDRdYfRa0yM6E5HHPQ" target="_blank"><i>John 1:29</i></a><i>) is not made. The fact that Jesus&#8217; resurrection proves His victory over death and sin and guarantees a resurrected eternal life for all who believe in Him (1 Corinthians 15) is nowhere to be found.  &#8211; </i>S. Michael Houdmann</p>
<p>Another endorser of the film was “Social Justice Christian” Rev. Jim Wallis.  In my column <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120911&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIE-sMLkZMpVsz_lvVUBF_fHl0fA" target="_blank">Liberalism created the culture of evil and death, part 3</a> I wrote:</p>
<p><i>This man wears many hats.  He is the founder of Sojourner’s Magazine, speaker, author and activist.  He’s also President Obama’s “spiritual advisor.”  This alone speaks volumes.  Rev. Wallis insists that he’s an evangelical Christian even though he has abandoned the biblical gospel for the “social gospel.”  He believes he’s on a mission from God to assist the poor and oppressed to bring forth the Kingdom of God on earth. </i></p>
<p>When this purveyor of the false social justice gospel was asked for advice by the couple, he gladly gave it to them:</p>
<p><i>What won me over to the whole series was the clip about Jesus meeting Peter, the fisherman. In a Washington, D.C., premiere of “The Bible” series a few weeks ago, I had wonderful conversations with Mark and Roma. Mark asked me if they were right to have Jesus say that he wanted to change the world. Those words are not literally in the scriptures, but it seemed to him and Roma that’s exactly what Jesus was talking about. Absolutely correct, I told them both. And we went through the first few chapters of Mathew which demonstrate that truth. I love the clarity and courage of the statement from Jesus in “The Bible.”</i></p>
<p>Sunny Shell disagrees:</p>
<p><i>Christ came into the world to save sinners from the righteous wrath of God, which is the just penalty for our sins. He never said He came to change the world. He said He came to transform people by giving them new hearts and new minds through repentance and faith in Christ alone. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunnyshell.org%2F2014%2F02%2Fmovie-review-son-of-god-is-most.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF602M-mwbXh5wlSVWozEG6U1sNzQ" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>The <i>Examiner</i> listed the names of churches and organizations that distributed tickets for a so-called &#8220;Theater Take-Over&#8221;:</p>
<p><strong><i>Joel Osteen</i></strong><i>, pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Tex., who is distributing 8,000 tickets donated by an anonymous donor; <strong>Jerry Falwell</strong>, Jr., of Liberty University which has more than 12,000 students; <strong>Craig Groeschel</strong> of LifeChurch which has 18 campuses in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles with over four million members and Miles McPherson of the Rock Church with weekly attendance of more than 10,000 in San Diego, Calif.</i> (Emphasis in original - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.examiner.com%2Farticle%2Frick-warren-son-of-god-best-movie-of-jesus-50-years&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFU_NyUVASLjKJekDa5tfeSfhWwKw" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>In an article that appeared on <i>Fox News</i>, Mark and Roma wrote:</p>
<p><i>In all our combined years in the entertainment industry, we’ve never seen anything like this kind of grass-roots support for a project. It is truly miraculous.</i></p>
<p><i>So, too, is the unprecedented depth and breadth of those who have endorsed the film. Pastors like Rick, as well as scholars and faith organizations, have graciously supported our effort to share this story of our Savior – though they belong to different denominations, adhere to varying theological doctrine, worship God in their own unique ways. </i></p>
<p><i>Bishop T.D. Jakes of The Potter’s House in Dallas said “the audience will be enthralled, encouraged and inspired.” </i></p>
<p>S. Michael Houdmann was not enthralled by the movie.  In his review he writes:</p>
<p><i>The Son of God presents a Jewish Messiah who is crucified, dies, comes back to life, and commissions His followers to spread the word. But why did He have to die? What is the meaning of the resurrection? What is the message the apostles were supposed to proclaim, and why was it worth dying for? <b></b></i></p>
<p>More from the <i>Fox News</i> article…</p>
<p><i>Joel Osteen of Lakewood Church in Houston called it “an epic work that touches the heart.”</i></p>
<p><i>The Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles Jose Gomez says it’s “a very important movie because it gives us the opportunity to realize God’s presence in our own lives.”</i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fopinion%2F2014%2F02%2F27%2Fson-god-miraculous-journey-to-big-screen%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-smuaswla4b1ygxCikRAo3i46Xw" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Certainly there are by now “Church leaders” that are sincerely shocked to find out that they endorsed a movie produced by New Age Catholics.  Here’s more proof from a 2010 article <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbecksmithhollywood.com%2F2009%2F04%2Froma-downey-happy-out-of-spotlight%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_oBUaRK962PgJULO81uMLpLoLuw" target="_blank">Roma Downey Happy Out of the Spotlight</a> that shows she’s an advocate of New Age/New Thought spirituality:</p>
<p><i>Says Roma, who lives in Malibu, ‘My kids go to school about a 40-minute drive away. I’m open to the group’s opinion about what we listen to on the way there. On the way back, I get my own selections — books on tape by Eckhart Tolle, Tony Robbins…My husband says I’m so self-realized I’m practically levitating.’</i></p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with Eckhart Tolle, he’s a New Ager.  A few years ago Tolle paired up with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F120507&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNExBXarCqOHwN2-lSGzbTk6euqV8A" target="_blank">Oprah Winfrey</a> to do 10 online classes on XM Satellite radio on his blockbuster book “A New Earth: Are You Ready to Be Awakened.”  Oprah and Tolle took participants through his book chapter by chapter.  Regrettably, a large number of professing Christians took the class!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christiananswersforthenewage.org%2FArticles_HumanPotential1.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-F3ncTQ4AYRlwb3R9_5522XPqIg" target="_blank">Human Potential</a> guru and &#8220;coach for success” Anthony Robbins once said: &#8220;My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel tons of pleasure and very little pain.&#8221;  Evidently no pain is experienced after completing a barefoot firewalk, a self-empower technique Robbins’ teaches to get an otherwise sane person to walk on a bed of burning hot coals during his “Unleash The Power Within” seminar.  On this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od-bcLqelnY#t=11" target="_blank">video</a> you’ll hear the sound of drums beating and the crowd chanting “YES! YES! YES!” as Robbinswhips them into a frenzy in preparation for the firewalk.</p>
<p>More…</p>
<p>Roma appeared on “psychic medium” <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renewamerica.com%2Fcolumns%2Fmwest%2F080328&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoEPHJhGb6qyChcEUmyIZoszlzew" target="_blank">John Edward’s</a> TV show and allegedly spoke to her deceased mother.  What does the Bible have to say about consulting a medium?</p>
<p><i>And he burned his son as an offering and used fortune-telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger.</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F2_kings%2F21.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbHPjPuA6cdkYAYbK5InRfolex4Q" target="_blank">2 Kings 21:6</a>)</p>
<p>Well, it’s apparent that Roma, who says she loves the Bible, is unaware—or doesn’t care&#8211;that God says consulting a medium is evil.</p>
<p>Later she collaborated with Edwards by providing a CD to accompany a book he wrote:</p>
<p><i>Roma prays the entire rosary</i><i> on the beautiful CD that comes along with this book. It’s quite lovely and gives you the special opportunity and a unique spiritual closeness to Roma to be able to pray right along with her as if she was right there at your side.”</i> (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdavemosher.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F03%2F06%2Froma-downeys-comments-and-connections-with-psychic-medium-john-edward-show-she-is-not-a-christian-as-she-claims-but-a-new-ager%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFvRX_2PmQgJ6HjxzeL4MTWIkJ4Q" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>So now you know a bit about two New Age gurus Roma Downey looks forward to listening to each day and an occultist she collaborated with.  The worldview of these men is as far from Christianity as the Earth is from Pluto.</p>
<p>P.J. Miller sat listening to Jim Bakker introduce Mark and Roma on Bakker’s TV show and recalled “their previous work on the History Channel’s The Bible and how they managed to literally re-write the Bible itself, and presented another gospel message altogether. I was captured by their … aggressive but subtle attempt to portray themselves as ‘believers’.  The sappy spiritual love fest that permeated on set showed me that something was indeed changing within Christianity, and that something was another Jesus being introduced to the masses.”</p>
<p><i>Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.</i><i> For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2Fmatthew%2F24.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGAUYRr8l_vl0ukuYfMAByj5ZPIRw" target="_blank">Mat/ 24: 23-24</a>)</p>
<p>After several weeks of due diligence I’ve decided that “Son of God” is not a film I wish to see.  In addition to the concerns I have included in this article, my research has turned up many more &#8212; way too many to incorporate here.  Most troubling is the astonishing lack of discernment shown by some of our so-called Christian leaders.  The Son of God I serve is best described in the Bible which is the inerrant, infallible, inspired Word of God.  Inspired means that God moved through the writers to convey to those who read it the words He wanted us to hear.  So to change the words that Christ spoke is prideful and wicked.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that those who are unfamiliar with the biblical Jesus and see this film will not come away with a clear understanding of His mission here on Earth.</p>
<p><i>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. </i>(<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbiblehub.com%2Fesv%2F1_john%2F2.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFadypSTjyThkBi-zCJpgrDYPqWQg" target="_blank">1John 2:2</a>)<i></i></p>
