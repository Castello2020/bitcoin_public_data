			<p>I am a great fan of Kiev, an affable city of pleasing bourgeois character, with its plentiful small restaurants, clean tree-lined streets, and bonhomie of its beer gardens. A hundred years ago Kiev was predominantly a Russian resort, and some central areas have retained this flavour. Now Kiev is patrolled by armed thugs from the Western Ukraine, by fighters from the neo-Nazi -Right Sector, descendants of Stepan Bandera, the Ukrainian Quisling’s troopers, and by their local comrades-in-arms of nationalist persuasion.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/BrownRevolution.jpg" width="586" /></p>
<p>After a month of confrontation, President Viktor Yanukovych gave in, signed the EC-prepared surrender and escaped their rough revolutionary justice by the skin of his teeth. The ruling party MPs were beaten and dispersed, the communists almost lynched, the opposition have the parliament all to themselves, and they&#8217;ve  appointed new ministers and taken over the Ukraine. The Brown Revolution has won in the Ukraine. This big East European country of fifty million inhabitants has gone the way of Libya. The US and the EU won this round, and pushed Russia back eastwards, just as they intended.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the neo-Nazi thugs who won the battle will agree to surrender the sweet fruits of victory to politicians, who are, God knows, nasty enough. And more importantly, it remains to be seen whether the Russian-speaking East and South East of the country will accept the Brown rule of Kiev, or  split off and go their own way, as the people of Israel (so relates the Bible) after King Solomon’s death rebelled against his heir saying “To your tents, o Israel!” and proclaimed independence of their fief (I Kings 12:16). Meanwhile it seems that the Easterners’ desire to preserve Ukrainian state integrity is stronger than their dislike for the victorious Browns. Though they assembled their representatives for what could be a declaration of independence, they did not dare to claim power. These peaceful people have little stamina for strife.</p>
<p>Their great neighbour, Russia, does not appear overtly concerned with this ominous development. Both Russian news agencies, TASS and RIA, didn’t even place the dire Ukrainian news at the top, as Reuters and BBC did: for them, the Olympics and the biathlon were of greater importance.</p>
<p>This “ostrich” attitude is quite typical of the Russian media: whenever they find themselves in an embarrassing position, they escape into showing the Swan Lake ballet on TV. That&#8217;s what they did when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. This time it was the Olympics instead of the ballet.</p>
<p>Anti-Putin opposition in Russia heartily approved of the Ukrainian coup.<i>Yesterday Kiev, tomorrow Moscow</i>, they chanted. <i>Maidan</i> (the main square of Kiev, the site of anti-government demos) <i>equals Bolotnaya</i> (a square in Moscow, the site of anti-government protests in December 2012) is another popular slogan.</p>
<p>The majority of Russians were upset but not surprised. Russia decided to minimise its involvement in the Ukraine some weeks ago as if they wished to demonstrate to the world their non-interference. Their behaviour bordered on recklessness. While foreign ministers of EC countries and their allies crowded Kiev, Putin sent Vladimir Lukin, a human rights emissary, an elder low-level politician of very little clout, to deal with the Ukrainian crisis. The Russian Ambassador Mr Zurabov, another non-entity, completely disappeared from public view. (Now he was recalled to Moscow). Putin  made not a single public statement on the Ukraine, treating it as though it were Libya or Mali, not a neighbouring country quite close to the Russian hinterland.</p>
<p>This hands-off approach could have been expected: Russia did not interfere in the disastrous Ukrainian elections 2004, or in the Georgian elections that produced extremely anti-Russian governments. Russia gets involved only if there is a real battle on the ground, and a legitimate government asks for help, as in Ossetia in 2008 or in Syria in 2011. Russia supports those who fight for their cause, otherwise Russia, somewhat disappointingly, stands aside.</p>
<p>The West has no such inhibitions and its representatives were extremely active: the US State Department representative Victoria “Fuck EC’’ Nuland had spent days and weeks in Kiev, feeding the insurgents with cookies, delivering millions of smuggled greenbacks to them, meeting with their leaders, planning and plotting the coup. Kiev is awash with the newest US dollars fresh from its mint (of a kind yet unseen in Moscow, I’ve been told by Russian friends). The US embassy spread money around like a tipsy Texan in a night club. Every able-bodied young man willing to fight received five hundred dollar a week, a qualified fighter – up to a thousand, a platoon commander had two thousand dollars – good money by Ukrainian standards.</p>
<p>Money is not all. People are also needed for a successful coup. There was an opposition to Yanukovych who won democratic elections, and accordingly, three parties lost elections. Supporters of the three parties could field a lot of people for a peaceful demonstration, or for a sit-in. But would they fight when push comes to shove? Probably not. Ditto the recipients of generous US and EC grants (Nuland <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=861DJLR4Cek&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D861DJLR4Cek&amp;app=desktop">estimated</a> the total sum of American investment in “democracy building” at five billion dollars). They could be called to come to the main square for a demo. However, the NGO beneficiaries are timid folk, not likely to risk their well-being. And the US needed a better fighting stock to remove the democratically elected president from power.</p>
<p><b>Serpent Eggs</b></p>
<p>In the Western Ukraine, the serpent eggs hatched: children of Nazi collaborators who had imbibed hatred towards the Russians with their mothers’ milk. Their fathers had formed a network under Reinhard Gehlen, the German spymaster. In 1945, as Germany was defeated, Gehlen swore allegiance to the US and delivered his networks to the CIA. They continued their guerrilla war against the Soviets until 1956. Their cruelty was legendary, for they aimed to terrify the population into full compliance to their command. Notoriously, they strangulated the Ukrainians suspected of being friendly to Russians with their bare hands.</p>
<p>A horrifying <a href="http://gubarev.org/istoriya/ispoved-byvshej-banderovki.html">confession of a participant</a> tells of their activities in Volyn: “One night, we strangulated 84 men. We strangulated adults, as for little kids, we held their legs, swung and broke their heads at a doorpost. …Two nice kids, Stepa and Olya, 12 and 14 years old… we tore the younger one into two parts, and there was no need to strangulate her mother Julia, she died of a heart attack” and so on and so on. They slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Poles and Jews; even the dreadful Baby Yar massacre was done by them, with German connivance, somewhat similar to Israeli connivance in the Sabra and Chatila massacres of Palestinians by the Lebanese fascists of the Phalange.</p>
<p>The children of these Bandera murderers were brought up to hate Communism,  Soviets and Russians, and in adoration of their fathers’ deeds. They formed the spearhead of the pro-US anti-government rebels in the Ukraine, the Right Sector led by out-and-out fascist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDC0lDxinY#t=171">Dmytro Yarosh</a>. They were ready to fight, to die and kill. Such units attract potential rebels of differing backgrounds: their spokesman is young Russian -turned -Ukrainian -nationalist Artem Skoropadsky, a journalist with the mainstream oligarch-owned <i>Kommersant-UA</i> daily. There are similar young Russians who join Salafi networks and become suicide-bombers in the Caucasus mountains – young people whose desire for action and sacrifice could not be satisfied in the consumer society. This is a Slav al-Qaeda &#8212; real neo-Nazi storm troopers, a natural ally of the US.</p>
<p>And they did not fight only for association with EC and against joining a Russia-led TC. Their enemies were also the Russians in the Ukraine, and Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainians. The difference between the twain is moot. Before independence in 1991, some three quarters of the population preferred to speak Russian. Since then, successive governments have tried to force people to use Ukrainian. For the Ukrainian neo-Nazis, anyone who speaks Russian is an enemy. You can compare this with Scotland, where people speak English, and nationalists would like to force them to speak the language of Burns.</p>
<p>Behind the spearhead of the Right Sector, with its fervent anti-communist and anti-Russian fighters, a larger organisation could be counted on: the neo-Nazi Freedom (Svoboda), of Tyagnibok. Some years ago Tyagnibok<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FYAXIobvJBs">called</a> for a fight against Russians and Jews, now he has become more cautious regarding the Jews. He is still as anti-Russian as John Foster Dulles. Tyagnibok was tolerated or even encouraged by Yanukovych, who wanted to take a leaf from the French president Jacques Chirac’s book. Chirac won the second round of elections against nationalist Le Pen, while probably he would have lost against any other opponent. In the same wise, Yanukovych wished Tyagnibok to become his defeatable opponent at the second round of presidential elections.</p>
<p>The parliamentary parties (the biggest one is the party of Julia Timoshenko with 25% of seats, the smaller one was the party of Klitschko the boxer with 15%) would support the turmoil as a way to gain power they lost at the elections.</p>
<p><b>Union of nationalists and liberals</b></p>
<p>Thus, <b>a union of nationalists and liberals</b> was formed. This union is the trademark of a new US policy in the Eastern Europe. It was tried in Russia two years ago, where enemies of Putin comprise of these two forces, of pro-Western liberals and of their new allies, Russian ethnic nationalists, soft and hard neo-Nazis. The liberals won’t fight, they are unpopular with the masses; they include an above-average percentage of Jews, gays, millionaires and liberal columnists; the nationalists can incite the great unwashed masses almost as well as the Bolsheviks, and will fight. This is the anti-Putin cocktail preferred by the US. This alliance actually took over 20% of vote in Moscow city elections, after their attempt to seize power by coup was beaten off by Putin. The Ukraine is their second, successful joint action.</p>
<p>Bear in mind: liberals do not have to support democracy. They do so only if they are certain democracy will deliver what they want. Otherwise, they can join forces with al Qaeda as now in Syria, with Islamic extremists as in Libya, with the Army as in Egypt, or with neo-Nazis, as now in Russia and the Ukraine. Historically, the liberal–Nazi alliance did not work because the old Nazis were enemies of bankers and financial capital, and therefore anti-Jewish. This hitch could be avoided: Mussolini was friendly to Jews and had a few Jewish ministers in his government; he objected to Hitler’s anti-Jewish attitude saying that “Jews are useful and friendly”. Hitler replied that if he were to allow that, thousands of Jews would join his party. Nowadays, this problem has vanished: modern neo-Nazis are friendly towards Jews, bankers and gays. The Norwegian killer Breivik is an exemplary sample of a Jew-friendly neo-Nazi. So are the Ukrainian and Russian neo-Nazis.</p>
<p>While the original Bandera thugs killed every Jew (and Pole) that came their way, their modern heirs receive some valuable Jewish support. The oligarchs of Jewish origin (Kolomoysky, Pinchuk and Poroshenko) financed them, while a prominent Jewish leader, Chairman of the Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities of the Ukraine, <a href="http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/biography/122">Josef Zissels</a>, supported them and justified them. There are many supporters of Bandera in Israel; they usually claim that Bandera was not an anti-Semite, as he had a Jewish doctor. (So did Hitler.) Jews do not mind Nazis who do not target them. The Russian neo-Nazis target Tajik gastarbeiters, and the Ukrainian neo-Nazis target Russian-speakers.</p>
<p><b>Revolution: the Outline</b></p>
<p>The revolution deserves to be described in a few lines: Yanukovych was not too bad a president, prudent though weak. Still the Ukraine came to the edge of financial abyss. (You can read more about it in my previous <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/20/what-really-happened-in-ukraine/">piece</a>) He tried to save the situation by allying with the EC, but the EC had no money to spare. Then he tried to make a deal with Russia, and Putin offered him a way out, without even demanding from him that the Ukraine join the Russian-led TC. This triggered the violent response of the EC and the US, as they were worried it would strengthen Russia.</p>
<p>Yanuk, as people call him for short, had few friends. Powerful Ukrainian oligarchs weren’t enamoured with him. Besides the usual reasons, they did not like the raider habits of Yanuk’s son, who would steal other men’s businesses. Here they may have had a point, for the leader of Belarus, the doughty Lukashenko, said that Yanuk’s son’s unorthodox ways of acquiring businesses brought disaster.</p>
<p>Yanuk’s electorate, the Russian-speaking people of the Ukraine (and they are a majority in the land, like English-speaking Scots are majority in Scotland) were disappointed with him because he did not give them the right to speak Russian and teach their children in Russian. The followers of Julia Timoshenko disliked him for jailing their leader. (She richly deserved it: she hired assassins, stole billions of Ukrainian state money in cahoots with a former prime minister, made a crooked deal with Gazprom at the expense of Ukrainian consumers, and what not.) Extreme nationalists hated him for not eradicating the Russian language.</p>
<p>The US-orchestrated attack on the elected President followed <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/your-democracy/2013/01/machiavelli-non-violence">Gene Sharp</a>’s instructions to a tee, namely: (1) seize a central square and organise a mass peaceful sit-in, (2) speak endlessly of danger of violent dispersal, (3) if the authorities do nothing, provoke bloodshed, (4) yell bloody murder, (5) the authority is horrified and stupefied and (6) removed and (7) new powers take over.</p>
<p>The most important element of the scheme has never been voiced by the cunning Sharp, and that is why the Occupy Wall Street movement (who thumbed through the book) failed to achieve the desired result. You have to have the Masters of Discourse™ i.e., Western mainstream media, on your side. Otherwise, the government will squash you as they did with the Occupy and many other similar movements. But here, the Western media was fully on the rebels’ side, for the events were organised by the US embassy.</p>
<p>At first, they gathered for a sit-in on the Independence Square (aka “Maidan Square”) some people they knew: recipients of USAID grants via the NGO network, <a href="http://alternatio.org/articles/articles/item/15135-%C3%B0%C3%A0%C3%B1%C3%AF%C3%A0%C3%A4-%C3%B1%C3%AC%C3%BB%C3%B1%C3%AB%C3%BB-%C3%AC%C3%A0%C3%A9%C3%A4%C3%A0%C3%AD%C3%A0-%E2%80%93-1">wrote</a> a Ukrainian expert Andrey Vajra, networks of fugitive oligarch Khoroshkovski, neo-Nazis of the Right Sector and radicals of the Common Cause. The peaceful assembly was lavishly entertained by artists; food and drink were served for free, free sex was encouraged – it was a carnival in the centre of the capital, and it began to attract the masses, as would happen in every city in the known universe. This carnival was paid for by the oligarchs and by the US embassy.</p>
<p>But the carnival could not last forever. As per (2), rumours of violent dispersal were spread. People became scared and drifted away. Only a small crowd of activists remained on the square. Provocation as per (3) was supplied by a Western agent within the administration, Mr Sergey Levochkin. He wrote his resignation letter, posted it and ordered police to violently disperse the sit-in. Police moved in and dispersed the activists. Nobody was killed, nobody was seriously wounded, &#8211; today, after a hundredfold dead, it is ridiculous even to mention this thrashing, &#8211; but the opposition yelled bloody murder at the time. The world media, this powerful tool in the hands of Masters of Discourse, decried “Yanukovych massacred children”. The EC and the US slapped on sanctions, foreign diplomats moved in, all claiming they want to protect peaceful demonstrators, while at the same time beefing up the Maidan crowd with armed gunmen and Right Sector fighters.</p>
<p>We referred to Gene Sharp, but the Maidan had an additional influence, that of Guy Debord and his concept of <a href="http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/debord/">Society of Spectacle</a>. It was not a real thing, but a well-done make-believe, as was its predecessor, the August 1991 Moscow “coup”. Yanukovych did everything to build up the Maidan resistance: he would send his riot police to disperse the crowd, and after they did only half of the job, he would call them back, and he did this every day. After such  treatment, even a very placid dog would bite.</p>
<p>The Spectacle-like unreal quality of Kiev events was emphasized by arrival of the imperial warmonger, the neocon philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy. He came to Maidan like he came to Libya and Bosnia, claiming human rights and threatening sanctions and bombing. Whenever he comes, war is following. I hope I shall be away from every country he plans to visit.</p>
<p>First victims of the Brown Revolution were the monuments – those of Lenin, for they do hate communism in every form, and those of the world war, because the revolutionaries solidarise with the lost side, with the German Nazis.</p>
<p>History will tell us to what extent Yanuk and his advisors understood what they were doing. Anyway, he encouraged the fire of Maidan by his inefficient raids by a weaponless police force. The neo-Nazis of Maidan used snipers against the police force, dozens of people were killed, but President Obama called upon Yanuk to desist, and he desisted. After renewed shooting, he would send the police in again. An EC diplomat would threaten him with the Hague tribunal dock, and he would call his police back. No government could function in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Eventually he collapsed, signed on the dotted line and departed for unknown destination. The rebels seized power, forbade the Russian language and began sacking Kiev and Lvov. Now the life of the placid people of Kiev has been turned into a living hell: daily robberies, beating, murder abound. The victors are preparing a military operation against the Russian-speaking areas in the South East of Ukraine. The spectacle of the revolution can yet turn really bloody.</p>
<p>Some Ukrainians hope that Julia Timoshenko, freshly released from jail, will be able to rein the rebels in. Others hope that President Putin will pay heed to the Ukrainian events, now that his Olympic games are, mercifully, finished. The spectacle is not over until the fat lady sings, but sing she will – her song still remains to be seen and heard.</p>

<p align="left">Public opinion in Western Europe is wrong to regard the Ukrainian crisis as a showdown between Westerners and Russians. In reality, Washington’s goal is not to push the country into the arms of the European Union, but to deprive Russia of its historical partners. To do this, the United States is prepared to ignite a new civil war on the continent.</p>
<p>After having dismembered Yugoslavia during a ten-year civil war (1990-1999), has the United States decided to destroy Ukraine in a similar way? This is what could be inferred from the maneuvers that the opposition is poised to launch during the Sochi Olympic Games.</p>
<p align="left">Ukraine has been historically divided between, in the West, a population turned towards the European Union and, in the East, a population oriented towards Russia, plus a small Muslim minority in Crimea. After the country‘s independence, the government gradually crumbled. Taking advantage of the confusion, the United States organized the «Orange Revolution» (2004) [<a id="nh1" title="&quot;Washington et Moscou se livrent bataille en Ukraine&quot;, by Emilia Nazarenko (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb1" rel="footnote">1</a>], which brought to power a mafia clan, also pro-Atlanticist. Moscow responded by lifting its subsidies on gas prices, but the Orange government could not rely on its Western allies to help pay the market price. Ultimately, it lost the 2010 presidential election in favor of Viktor Yanukovych, a corrupt politician, and on again-off again pro-Russian.</p>
<p align="left">On 21 November 2013, the government renounces signing the Association Agreement negotiated with the European Union. The opposition responds with protests in Kiev and in the western part of the country, which quickly take on an insurrectionary appearance. It calls for early presidential and parliamentary elections and refuses to form a government when approached by President Yanukovych and the Prime Minister resigns. The events are baptized Euromaidan, then Eurorevolution, by Radio Free Europe (run by the State Department).</p>
<p align="left">The crowd control for the opposition is provided by Azatlyk, a group of young Crimean Tatars who returned from Jihad in Syria especially for the occasion [<a id="nh2" title="“Jihadists in charge of crowd control in Kiev protests”, Translation Alizée (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb2" rel="footnote">2</a>].</p>
<p align="left">The Atlanticist media champion the cause of the «democratic opposition» and condemn Russian influence. High-profile Western figures turn up to manifest their support to the protesters, including Victoria Nuland (Assistant Secretary of State and former Ambassador to NATO) and John McCain (Chairman of the Republican branch of the NED). For its part, the Russian press condemns protesters who have taken to the streets to overthrow democratically elected institutions.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Torch-lit march of 15,000 Nazis in Kiev on 1 January 2014.</em></p>
<p><iframe name="I1" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AthFgiD1_pU" height="400" width="582" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p align="left">At first, the movement seemed to be an attempt to orchestrate a second «Orange Revolution.» But on 1 January 2014 the power in the street changes hands. The Nazi «Freedom» party organizes a 15 000-strong torch-lit march in memory of Stepan Bandera (1909-1959), the nationalist leader who allied himself with the Nazis against the Soviets. Since this event, the capital has been covered with anti-Semitic graffiti and people are attacked on the street for being Jewish.</p>
<p align="left">The pro-European opposition is made up of three political parties:</p>
<ul>
<li> The All-Ukrainian Union &#8220;Fatherland&#8221; (Batkivshchyna), led by the oligarch and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko (serving a prison sentence following her convictions for embezzlement) and currently headed by lawyer and former Parliament speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk. It stands for private property and the Western liberal model. It garnered 25.57% of the vote in the 2012 parliamentary elections.</li>
<li> The Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (Udar), of former boxing world champion Vitali Klitschko. It claims to identify with Christian Democracy and picked up 13.98% in the 2012 elections.</li>
<li> The All-Ukrainian Union &#8220;Svoboda&#8221; (Freedom), led by the surgeon Oleh Tyahnybok. This political group sprang from the National Socialist Party of Ukraine. It promotes the denaturalization of Jewish Ukrainians. It won 10.45% of the vote in the 2012 parliamentary elections.</li>
<p>These parliamentary parties have the support of:</p>
<li> The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, a Nazi splinter group from the former NATO stay-behind networks in the Eastern Bloc [<a id="nh3" title="This is the cesspool that the father of the &quot;Orange revolution&quot; alighted (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb3" rel="footnote">3</a>]. A Zionist, he calls for the denaturalization and deportation of Ukrainian Jews to Israel. He received 1.11% of the vote in 2012.</li>
<li> The Ukrainian Self-Defense, a nationalist splinter group that sent its members to fight the Russians in Chechnya and Ossetia during the Georgian conflict. It got 0.08% of the vote in 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In addition, the opposition has received the endorsement of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, in revolt against the Moscow Patriarchate. Ever since the Nazi Party took over the streets, the demonstrators &#8211; many of them wearing helmets and dressed in paramilitary uniforms -have erected barricades and stormed government buildings. Certain elements of the police force have also displayed great brutality, going so far as to torture detainees. A dozen protesters were killed and nearly 2,000 were wounded. The unrest spread to the western provinces of the country.</p>
<p align="left">According to our information, the Ukrainian opposition seeks to import military materials acquired on parallel markets. It is obviously not possible to purchase weapons in Western Europe and bring them in without NATO’s green light.</p>
<p align="left">Washington’s strategy in Ukraine would appear to be a combination of proven &#8220;color revolution&#8221; recipes with others recently concocted during the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; [<a id="nh4" title="“Coup in Western Ukraine: the Arab Spring unleashed in Europe”, by Andrew (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb4" rel="footnote">4</a>]. Moreover, the United States makes no effort to hide it: it dispatched two officials, Victoria Nuland (deputy to John Kerry) and John McCain (who is not only a Republican senator, but also the chairman of IRI, the Republican branch of the NED [<a id="nh5" title="&quot;La NED, vitrine légale de la CIA&quot;, by Thierry Meyssan, Odnako/Réseau (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb5" rel="footnote">5</a>]) to support the protesters. Unlike Libya and Syria, Washington does not have jihadists on hand to sow chaos (except for Tatar extremists, but they are only located in Crimea). It was therefore decided to lean on the Nazis with whom the State Department worked against the Soviets and has organized in political parties since independence.</p>
<p align="left">The inexperienced reader may be taken aback by this alliance between the Obama administration and the Nazis. However, it must be remembered that Ukrainian Nazis were publicly honored at the White House by President Reagan, including Yaroslav Stetsko, Ukrainian Prime Minister under the Third Reich, who became the head of the anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations and a member of the World anti-Communist League [<a id="nh6" title="&quot;La Ligue anti-communiste mondiale, une internationale du crime&quot;, by (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb6" rel="footnote">6</a>]. One of his deputies, Lev Dobriansky, became U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, while his daughter Paula Dobriansky served as Under Secretary of State for Democracy (sic) during the George W. Bush administration. It is the same Ms. Dobriansky who for ten years sponsored a historical research with the aim of clouding the fact that the Holodomor, the famine that hit Ukraine in 1932-33, also devastated Russia and Kazakhstan, thereby reinforcing the myth that Stalin was determined to eliminate the Ukrainian people [<a id="nh7" title="See: L’Holodomor, nouvel avatar de l’anticommunisme « européen », by Professor (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb7" rel="footnote">7</a>].</p>
<p align="left">In fact, Washington, who had supported the German Nazi party until 1939 and continued to do business with Nazi Germany until the end of 1941, never had a moral problem with Nazism, not more than it has today in providing military support to jihadism in Syria.</p>
<p align="left">Western European elites, who use Nazism as a pretext to harass firebrands &#8211; as seen with the „quenelle“ controversy over French comedien Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala [<a id="nh8" title="“The Bête Noire of the French Establishment”, by Diana Johnstone, (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb8" rel="footnote">8</a>] &#8211; have forgotten what it really is. In 2005, they closed their eyes to the rehabilitation of Nazism by the President of Latvia, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, as if it were trivial [<a id="nh9" title="“Latvian President Rehabilitates Nazism”, by Thierry Meyssan, Voltaire (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb9" rel="footnote">9</a>]. On the simple strength of statements in favor of the European Union, and wrapped up in their blissful Atlanticism, they now support their worst enemy. Civil war could start in Ukraine during the Olympic Games in Sochi.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all too customary for those analyzing the crises humanity faces to associate climate change, aka global warming, with whatever proximate cause they postulate for our imminent demise. John Tirman, for instance, in his book <i>100 Ways America Is Screwing Up the World </i>lists as the first way &#8220;Altering the Earth&#8217;s Climate&#8221;. Richard Heinberg of the Post Carbon Institute includes Climate along with Energy and Debt as the three problem areas which threaten our future. Nafez Mossadeq Ahmed, author of <i>A User&#8217;s Guide to the Crisis of Civilization, </i>integrates climate change with the other crises he believes civilization faces: the financial meltdown, dwindling oil reserves, terrorism and food shortages. This linking of concrete, demonstrable societal ills with the less grounded, more debatable theory of global warming is an ill-considered, strategic mistake, I think, as I believe critics of the global warming theory, the so-called &#8220;deniers&#8221;, are going to win the debate, at least for the near future. It would be a tragedy if valid, much-needed warnings about the dangers haunting our future were to be discredited because of their being tied to discredited fears about climate change.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why I think this is likely to happen. The warming trend which the earth experienced in the thirty years before the turn of this century has virtually stopped. This &#8220;hiatus&#8221;, as it is called, has been going on for over a decade and is likely to continue for another two. Check out this graph from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/GlobalTemp2012-3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>What do you see? I see a 60-year cycle in which a 30-year cooling period alternates with a 30-year warming period; to wit, from about 1880 to 1910 the mean global temperature went down, then from 1910 to 1940 the earth warmed up, then from 1940 to 1970, the earth cooled slightly, followed by the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000 when the earth warmed dramatically, and finally the dozen years from the turn of the century till now during which the mean temperature hasn&#8217;t risen (the hiatus). Given that the concept of a mean global temperature is an artificial construct subject to error and manipulation, just looking at this graph what would you predict for the near future? Wouldn&#8217;t you bet that for the next 20 years or so the earth is not going to get warmer, may even cool a bit?</p>
<p>If this does come to pass, what will be the consequence for the theory of global warming? Won&#8217;t it be viewed with increasing skepticism by the pubic at large, at least until the next warming demi-cycle commences 20 years from now? Won&#8217;t the discrediting of the global warming theory infect theories which have been linked to it? Are you willing to wait 20 years for your forewarnings of impending doom to be taken seriously?</p>
<p>Unless you have been following the issue as I have, you are probably not aware that the debate over the theory of global warming has been heating up (pardon the pun) of late, largely because of the prolonged <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2FSB10001424052748703939404574567423917025400&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFs9snwLEeAW4bTOf7Mp2g7GIib0A" target="_blank">global tepidness</a>. If you believe the science is settled, consider that the &#8220;settled&#8221; science has generated a multiplicity of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.drroyspencer.com%2F2013%2F10%2Fmaybe-that-ipcc-95-certainty-was-correct-after-all%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7Bt3nMFEpQ9HyA-zkESEEXjey5g" target="_blank">climate models</a> which have done a terrible job of forecasting, invariably predicting warmer temperatures than what has actually occurred. If the science is so settled, why have global warming adherents only recently postulated that heat from the warming of the atmosphere is being absorbed by the oceans, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwattsupwiththat.com%2F2013%2F02%2F25%2Focean-temperature-and-heat-content%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHd4DbZdp9AMD2_BRMTtDHv7nqxQ" target="_blank">their explanation for the hiatus</a>? The models did not foresee this.What about that august body of climate scientists who comprise the UN&#8217;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), you ask. Just recently the IPCC certified once again &#8211; with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fjudithcurry.com%2F2013%2F10%2F17%2Funcertain-future-of-climate-uncertainty%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtdkQIDADZ3tpJ6WMOXgLKCmdclg" target="_blank">95% certainty</a> (whatever that means) &#8211; that human activities are causing global warming? We are told that 1800 scientists arrived at this conclusion; but, if you look into it, you will find the majority of the scientists on the panel are not climatologists and some not scientists at all. One scientist who served on the IPCC&#8217;s review committee called global warming fears the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.climatedepot.com%2F2013%2F08%2F21%2Fun-scientists-who-have-turned-on-unipcc-man-made-climate-fears-a-climate-depot-flashback-report%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkoCwJOBN73oBR6Htmphc5NZM39g" target="_blank">worst scientific scandal in history</a>, predicting &#8220;When people come to know what the truth is, they will feel deceived by science and scientists.”For one side in a debate to label the opposition &#8220;deniers&#8221; is a sleazy rhetorical gambit usually employed by the name-callers when they are losing the debate (equally true in the case of another group of iconoclasts routinely labeled &#8220;deniers&#8221;, but that&#8217;s a story for another day). Consider who some of these so-called &#8220;deniers&#8221; are:</p>
<p>Richard Lindzen, Professor of Meteorology at MIT<br />
Fred Singer, Professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of Virginia<br />
Roy Spencer, former NASA Senior Scientist for Climate Studies<br />
Judith Curry, chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech<br />
Pat Michaels, past president of the American Association of State Climatologists</p>
<p>Do you really believe such people deny science?</p>
<p>Perhaps you believe such credentialed skeptics are in the pay of Big Oil. It&#8217;s true that the global warming theory was once opposed by powerful interests who dominated the debate; but, when a former Vice President of the United States can win both an Academy Award and a Noble Prize for a highly tendentious film full of hyperbole and misinformation, you know there are powerful interests behind the global warming scare, too. If Big Oil has bought off the media, why is it that so many people are aware that sea ice in the Arctic shrank to its smallest extent in modern times in 2012 but not that sea ice in the Antarctic was expanding at the same time or that ice in the Arctic made its largest rebound ever last year, approaching the average for the last thirty years? Why is every extreme weather event - <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salon.com%2F2013%2F05%2F03%2Fblizzards_in_may_wild_fires_is_this_global_warming%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBs19aaueAmazwOrJ-lDDye-0bpQ" target="_blank">even blizzards</a>- attributed to global warming when, in fact, extreme events like <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstevengoddard.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F09%2F09%2Flowest-five-year-count-of-us-hurricanes-on-record%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGg7a0GHw711J8NK-ffxzuHppt3KA" target="_blank">hurricanes</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstevengoddard.wordpress.com%2F%3Fs%3Dforest%2Bfires&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtSw6FOcRgikQlE-UIRqDKzBIXSA" target="_blank">forest fires</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F11%2F21%2Fopinion%2Fthe-truth-about-tornadoes.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFia9Jqd_i2D7H60GaqPFT9iYmfLQ" target="_blank">tornados</a> and even <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstevengoddard.wordpress.com%2F2010%2F11%2F06%2Fmost-us-states-had-their-hottest-year-prior-to-1970%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhaW2KIUFDtH1qcgz35-IJXmntMA" target="_blank">record high temperatures</a> are less prevalent today than in the past?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a climatologist, so I&#8217;m neither inclined nor competent to expound on the science of global warming, but I do hope to have convinced you that the science surrounding global warming is far from settled and consequently to hitch your wagon to that fading star is not a good idea. Please, at least listen to what the skeptics have to say &#8211; for instance, by consulting the websites I&#8217;ve cited &#8211; before you link the fate of your own doleful prophecies to that of climate change.</p>

<p>A geopolitically tense atmosphere prevails.</p>
<p>Security is extremely tight. It&#8217;s prioritized for good reason. Terrorist attacks are possible. Don&#8217;t discount potential Washington shenanigans.</p>
<p>Perhaps raining on Putin&#8217;s parade is planned. Obama may want him embarrassed. False flags are a longstanding US tradition. Will Sochi be Washington&#8217;s next target? The fullness of time will tell.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a virtual armed camp. Measures in place are unprecedented. Around $2 billion was spent on security.</p>
<p>Ahead of February 6, around 23,000 personnel assured proper measures were in place as planned.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of police officers are deployed. They&#8217;re backed by helicopters, drones, gunboats, submarines, and 70,000 Russian troops.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Cossacks are involved. They&#8217;ll check IDs. They&#8217;ll detain suspects. Sochi&#8217;s proximity to the North Caucasus raised concerns.</p>
<p>Islamist jihadists named it a target. They&#8217;re US assets. They&#8217;re used strategically. Washington used likeminded ones against Soviet Russia in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Libya was targeted this way. They comprise America&#8217;s anti-Syrian proxy death squads.</p>
<p>Russia raised concerns after December Volgograd bombings killed 34 people. Were Washington&#8217;s dirty hands involved?</p>
<p>Is something similar planned for Sochi? Hegemons operate this way. America is by far the worst. Anything ahead is possible.</p>
<p>According to Sochi Organizing Committee chairman Dmitry Chernyshenko:</p>
<p>&#8220;Terrorism is a global threat, and for terrorism there is no boundaries, no territories, but here in Sochi from the very beginning of the construction phase the state authorities did their utmost to prepare special measures, starting from the screening of raw materials, checking all the venues and preparing far-reaching security measures to provide the safest ever environment here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A controlled zone was established. It covers 60 kilometers. It runs along the coast. It extends 25 kilometers inland.</p>
<p>It includes all venues. They&#8217;re heavily guarded. The entire area is for authorized visitors only.</p>
<p>Western anti-Russian sentiment persists. Cold War politics continues. Putin bashing is featured. He&#8217;s not about to roll over for Washington.</p>
<p>He wants rule of law principles respected. He opposes Western imperialism. He&#8217;s against meddling in the internal affairs of Russia, Syria, Ukraine and other nations.</p>
<p>He stresses Moscow&#8217;s &#8220;independent foreign policy.&#8221; He affirms the &#8220;inalienable right to security for all states, the inadmissibility of excessive force, and unconditional observance of international law.&#8221;</p>
<p>He and Obama disagree on fundamental geopolitical issues. Key is national sovereignty. So are war and peace. America claims a divine right to fight. Putin prioritizes diplomatic conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Disagreements between both countries play out in dueling agendas. Washington notoriously plays hardball. Putin protects Russia&#8217;s national interests. They&#8217;re too important to sacrifice.</p>
<p>US media scoundrels target him. They vilify him. They mischaracterize him. They call him a Russian strongman. They make all kinds of baseless accusations.</p>
<p>Lies, damns lies and misinformation substitute for truth and full disclosure. They want him embarrassed. They&#8217;re raining on his Sochi parade.</p>
<p>On February 6, the <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/377a33f2-8f31-11e3-be85-00144feab7de.html#axzz2sdlh41WB">Financial Times</a> headlined &#8220;Putin gambles all on creation myth behind Sochi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am particularly pleased to see what is happening here because I chose this place myself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been in 2001 or 2002,&#8221; he added. &#8220;(W)e were driving around and arrived at this brook, and I said: &#8216;Let&#8217;s start from here.&#8217; That&#8217;s how it all began.&#8221;</p>
<p>Putin staked much on the games, said the FT. George Washington University&#8217;s Sufian Zhemukhov said &#8220;(i)f all goes well, (he&#8217;ll) be seen as the leader who resurrected Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Failure perhaps won&#8217;t be forgiven, he added. His forthrightness for peace &#8220;made him a force on the world stage,&#8221; said the FT.</p>
<p>A January Levada Center poll showed he&#8217;d be elected today by a wide margin. At the same time, his overall support dropped.</p>
<p>Excluding undecided respondents, its &#8220;higher than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s taking no chances. He&#8217;s going all out to make Sochi successful. FT comments were tame compared to America&#8217;s media.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303942404579361421256273630?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303942404579361421256273630.html">Wall Street Journal</a> headlined &#8220;The Putin Games.&#8221; He wants them to &#8220;showcase&#8230;modern Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;(H)e succeeded (but) not as he intended&#8230;What could go wrong?&#8221; Sochi is the most expensive Olympics in history.</p>
<p>Around $50 billion was spent. It&#8217;s five times the original estimate. It&#8217;s double what Britain&#8217;s 2012 summer games cost. It&#8217;s a fourth more than China spent in 2008.</p>
<p>Much of Sochi&#8217;s cost related to building vital infrastructure. It had to be done from scratch. Doing so added enormously to costs.</p>
<p>Major projects are expensive. According to Journal editors, &#8220;(t)he games are proving to be a case study in the Putin political and economic method.&#8221;</p>
<p>They claim billions of dollars &#8220;lost to corruption.&#8221; They provide no evidence proving it. They said &#8220;Russians call this Olympiad the Korimpiad.&#8221;</p>
<p>More Putin bashing followed. It&#8217;s standard scoundrel media practice. Journal editors feature it.</p>
<p>They claim he &#8220;made it impossible to hold his regime accountable through free elections or media.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fact check:</p>
<p>Russian elections shame America&#8217;s sham ones. They&#8217;re democratic. They not rigged. Monied interests don&#8217;t control them.</p>
<p>Outcomes aren&#8217;t predetermined. Russian voters decide. US ones have no say.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect Journal editors to explain. Or how Voice of Russia and RT (formerly Russia Today) shame America&#8217;s corporate media.</p>
<p>They feature news, information and opinion viewers most need to know. They do it forthrightly. They&#8217;re polar opposite America&#8217;s managed news misinformation.</p>
<p>Truth is systematically suppressed. Demagoguery, propaganda, scandal, sleaze, junk food news, and warmongering substitute.</p>
<p>Journal editors ignore truth and full disclosure. Bias permeates their opinions. They betray readers. They shame themselves doing so.</p>
<p>They claimed billions spent on Sochi left it unprepared. They cite &#8220;unfinished hotel rooms, incomplete road work and now the famous photographs of two toilets in a single stall.&#8221;</p>
<p>RT.com responded. On February 6, it <a href="http://rt.com/news/sochi-worst-olympics-toilet-918/">headlined</a> &#8220;Spread fear, toilet humor? MSM guide to &#8216;Worst. Olympics. EVAR!&#8221; (Repeat: EVAR!)</p>
<p>Even before the opening ceremony, MSM scoundrels drew conclusions &#8220;Sports? Not really,&#8221; said RT. At issue is malicious Putin bashing. It&#8217;s longstanding practice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s MSM&#8217;s &#8220;own Sochi 2014 moan-athon.&#8221; Imagine claiming something yet to occur the &#8220;worst Olympics ever.&#8221; They beat up on Beijing the same way.</p>
<p>They &#8220;never believed in Sochi,&#8221; said RT. They called its climate unfit for winter games. They cite corruption with no substantiating evidence.</p>
<p>They claim lax security despite unprecedented measures in place. They discuss possible terrorist threats. They leave unexplained what most worrisome &#8211; a possible disruptive US false flag attack.</p>
<p>It bears repeating. Perhaps Washington plans raining on Putin&#8217;s parade.</p>
<p>On August 7, 2008, hours before Beijing&#8217;s summer Olympics&#8217; opening ceremony, Georgia&#8217;s Mikheil Saakashvili invaded South Ossetia. He did so at Washington&#8217;s behest. Attacking was strategically timed.</p>
<p>After Soviet Russia&#8217;s 1991 dissolution, South Assetia broke away from Georgia. It declared independence. It&#8217;s home to many Russian nationals.</p>
<p>Moscow responded responsibly. Conflict continued for days. Then President Medvedev was on vacation. Then Prime Minister Putin was in Beijing.</p>
<p>In half a day before Russia intervened, 1,700 people were killed. Included were 12 Russian peacekeepers.</p>
<p>Moscow was blamed for Georgian aggression. Does Washington plan something similar this time? Will a false flag attack occur?</p>
<p>Will Obama usurp a freer hand in Ukraine? Will he take advantage in Syria? Does he plan other mischief? Is disrupting Sochi planned?</p>
<p>Hegemons operate this way. Washington&#8217;s disturbing history gives Russia good reason for concern.</p>
<p>Preparations in Sochi aren&#8217;t perfect, said RT. &#8220;(F)laws and problems&#8221; exist. &#8220;But what makes the Sochi Olympics &#8216;the worst&#8217; so far is&#8230;accommodation for the global media elite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See it, slam it,&#8221; said RT. &#8220;Intrepid Olympic reporters, we thought, would get behind the scenes, unravel the PR.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. Not this time. Of global importance were rooms (if they were available), toilets, floors, and shower curtains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh &#8211; and a request to not flush toilet paper (it&#8217;s rarely done in public toilets) had the press pack throwing up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Washington Post reporter Kathy Lally was upset about &#8220;a tiny, tiny (hotel room) sink.&#8221;</p>
<p>It &#8220;sits atop an exposed white plastic pipe, stuck to the wall and surrounded by an unruly gob of caulk,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The single room has two lamps &#8211; which don&#8217;t have light bulbs, but that&#8217;s okay because they aren&#8217;t near any unused outlets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other journalists reported missing shower curtains, lamps, chairs, inadequate heat and hot water, and whatever else they wanted to cite to bash Putin.</p>
<p>Fox News called conditions &#8220;laughably bad.&#8221; It warned about event coverage being just as dreadful.</p>
<p>MSM scoundrels feature daily &#8220;hotel horror stories.&#8221; They regurgitate similar tweets to each other. They find new reasons to complain.</p>
<p>BBC journalist Steve Rosenberg tweeted about two sit-down toilets shown side-by-side with no partition. It went viral.</p>
<p>RT calls it a &#8220;must have&#8221; for every Sochi story. Imagine toilet humor substituting for real journalism. It gets worse.</p>
<p>Whatever is happening in Russia multiple time zones away gets reported. A Moscow school shooting creates Sochi shudders.</p>
<p>So does a derailed gas-laden freight train exploding. It happened 500 miles northeast of Moscow. It made Sochi headlines.</p>
<p>CNN connected Sochi to the September 2004 Beslan school siege. Its February 5 report said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Amid the shrill noise of militant threats ahead of the Sochi Olympic Winter Games, the gym in Beslan is now steeped in silence, a monument to the dead, untouched almost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trashing Sochi bashes Putin. MSM scoundrels are deplorable. They disgrace themselves before dwindling audiences.</p>
<p>CNN and other US cable news networks report increasing to fewer viewers. Maybe one day they&#8217;ll all tune out.</p>
<p>RT called Sochi the &#8220;biggest construction site in the world over the past seven years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything there &#8211; most of the hotels, sport venues, high-speed rail links, highways, 50 bridges, even the Olympic village itself &#8211; was built from scratch.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an extraordinary achievement in a short time. It&#8217;s almost like building an entirely new city in record time. Sochi deserves praise, not criticism.</p>
<p>Toronto Star reporter Rosie Dimanno wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mounds of debris, parts of roads unpaved, mesh hoarding to hide the eyesore bits, lots of trash, unreliable power &#8211; nothing upsets journalists more than an internet that goes up and down &#8211; these have all featured in Olympics over the past three decades, as the Games have grown too big, too gaudy and too complicated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Olympics are no (place) for old sissies,&#8221; she added. &#8220;So I&#8217;ll take my own advice: Just chill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most MSM scoundrels report as expected. They mock legitimate journalism. It&#8217;s verboten in America. It&#8217;s lacking in Canada. It&#8217;s largely absent in Western Europe. Managed news misinformation substitutes.</p>
<p>WSJ editors called Sochi &#8220;a shrine to authoritarianism.&#8221; They bashed Putin relentlessly. One bald-faced lie followed others.</p>
<p>&#8220;(T)he underbelly of Mr. Putin&#8217;s regime (was) exposed,&#8221; they claimed.</p>
<p>New York Times editors were just as bad. They headlined &#8220;A Spotlight on Mr. Putin&#8217;s Russia,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;(T)he reality of (his) Russia&#8230;conflicts starkly with Olympic ideals and fundamental human rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no way to ignore the dark side &#8211; the soul-crushing repression, the cruel new anti-gay and blasphemy laws, and the corrupt legal system in which political dissidents are sentenced to lengthy terms on false charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fact check</p>
<p>NYT editors have a longstanding disturbing history. They one-sidedly support wealth, power and privilege. Whenever Washington wages imperial wars or plans them, they march in lockstep.</p>
<p>They long ago lost credibility. They feature mind-numbing misinformation. They violate their own journalistic code doing so.</p>
<p>They invented anti-gay law controversy. Russian gay propaganda law has nothing to do with persecuting people for their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s rights are respected. Russia wants its children protected from malicious anti-gay propaganda, illicit drugs, alcohol abuse and whatever else harms them.</p>
<p>Responsible governance demands it. America leaves millions of children unprotected. Cutting food stamps alone denies them vital nutrition.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect Times editors to explain. Or about thousands of political prisoners languishing in America&#8217;s gulag.</p>
<p>About torture being official US policy. About rigged US elections.  About impoverishing neoliberal harshness.</p>
<p>About destroying social America. About eliminating America&#8217;s middle class. About waging war on freedom.</p>
<p>About unprecedented levels of public and private corruption. About kleptocracy masquerading as democracy.</p>
<p>About out-of-control corporate empowerment. About Washington being corporate occupied territory. About crushing organized labor.</p>
<p>About commodifying public education. About ignoring international, constitutional and US statute laws.</p>
<p>About violating fundamental human and civil rights. About Obama&#8217;s war on humanity.</p>
<p>Bashing Putin takes precedence. Managed news misinformation proliferates.</p>
<p>Times editors report like other media scoundrels. MSM ones long ago lost credibility. They replicate the worst of each other.</p>
<p>They support what demands condemnation. They back wrong over right. Readers and viewers demand better.</p>
<p>MSM scoundrels don&#8217;t deliver. Sochi games run through February 23. Expect lots more Putin bashing ahead.</p>

<p>A trend is beginning among families with sick children: more and more are moving to Colorado to find a cannabis-based treatment that works wonders on seizure disorders. As more and more families find out about the cure, the company that manufactures it is struggling to keep up with the demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just have so much demand,&#8221; Jordan Stanley, one of the brothers who owns the Realm of Caring Foundation, told <a href="http://www.wbtv.com/story/24623171/charlotte-families-uprooting-lives-for-medicine-only-legal-in-colorado">WBTV</a>.  &#8220;We need more space to keep growing these plants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Stanley brothers founded the company when they succeeded in making a cannabis compound that was free of THC, the chemical that causes a “high” feeling in the user. The drug, called “Charlotte’s Web,” after the first child it worked on, only contains high anounts of therapeutic cannabidiol, or CBD.</p>
<p>The Realm of Caring headquarters, located in an innocuous cabin and greenhouses tucked away in the Colorado Rockies, gets about 500 calls a week from parents across America, according to Stanley. 150 children currently use the medicine.</p>
<p>The company is prudent about taking on patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t start a child on the medicine unless they&#8217;re approved as having other options not work,&#8221; said Stanley. &#8220;And unless we have enough medicine for them to last their entire lifetime.  We don&#8217;t want to start a child, have this work, then have them depend on it and us run out of supply.  That&#8217;s why we need to build.  We need to have more so we can start more kids on what seems to be working.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liz Gorman, a mom from Charlotte, N.C, moved her family to Colorado in a last-ditch attempt to find a drug that would work for her 7-year-old daughter Maddie’s severe seizure disorder.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was going rapidly downhill when we moved,&#8221; Gorman told WBTV from her new home in Colorado Springs.  &#8220;Things were getting worse by the week.  We were at about 100 seizures a day.  So to now see improvement  &#8211; we can sometimes be at 10 a day &#8211; and improvement in cognition, it&#8217;s pretty impressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residents in states like <a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/drug-law/georgia-parents-call-medical-marijuana-sick-kids">Georgia</a> and <a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/drug-law/tennessee-may-legalize-medical-marijuana">Tennessee</a> have been lobbying lawmakers to pass legislation legalizing marijuana. Many are parents whose children are afflicted with similarly severe seizure disorders.</p>
<p>But state governments are reluctant to make the change, probably because &#8220;cannabis&#8221; has a bad rap.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s about stigma,&#8221; Gorman said. &#8220;Having tried it now and having had to move across country to get it, I honestly feel this is ridiculous we can&#8217;t have it everywhere.  Aside from the fact it comes from a cannabis plant, there&#8217;s nothing about it really that&#8217;s dangerous.  Parents don&#8217;t need to be afraid that their children could get ahold of it and use it in an incorrect way.&#8221;</p>

<p>I just finished reading Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s book, &#8220;David and Goliath&#8221; &#8212; wherein Gladwell says that, in the course of any human interaction, there will always be a graphic curve of diminishing returns when it comes to maximizing the use of force in order to achieve one&#8217;s goals.</p>
<p>In other words, always punching other people&#8217;s lights out in order to get your own way can very quickly become counterproductive.  Good grief, I think that Gladwell might be onto something here.</p>
<p>Want examples?</p>
<p>If the maximum use of force in order to obtain one&#8217;s goals had been successful in Iraq (and assuming that said goals were to depose a dictator and not just to create chaos and steal oil), then the Bush-led invasion would never have been such a dismal failure and there never would have been such a disastrous resistance war there &#8212; one that still keeps rolling right along to this day.  So much for Shock and Awe.</p>
<p>If maximum use of force really worked, then Europe would still be saluting Hitler.</p>
<p>Slavery would still be on the books in Georgia and Alabama because of all those happy slaves it created.  Or, alternatively, segregation would still be a huge success and MLK would have had no effect at all on it.</p>
<p>Descendants of Genghis Khan would still be running Russia and China.</p>
<p>There would be no Child Protective Services anywhere and parents would still be beating their kids to within an inch of their lives.  And I would still be lovingly obeying my mean older sister.</p>
<p>Women would look forward to being placed in harems and having a dozen babies each and would never demand the right to be pro-choice.  &#8220;Barefoot and pregnant.&#8221;  They would know their place as slaves to their husbands and not strive for anything else.  Rape would not be a problem for women and girls.</p>
<p>Those viscous stormtroopers who illegally seized control of Palestine 65 years ago by ruthlessly wiping out hundreds of villages and slaughtering Christians and Muslims by the thousands?  They would not still be getting resistance from the Occupied Territories even now.  And the current Israeli neo-cons&#8217; constant brutal &#8220;eye for an eye&#8221; faux cleverness wouldn&#8217;t have forced Al Qaeda out of the remote caves of Afghanistan where it was holed up in 2001 &#8212; and forced it into not-so-remote southern Syria where Al Qaeda is now, right at Israel&#8217;s front door.</p>
<p>And there would not have been 30 years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland either.</p>
<p>And in South America, Pinochet&#8217;s ghost would still be running Chile, Argentina&#8217;s Dirty War would have made Henry Kissinger proud, the billions Reagan spent on killing peasants in Guatemala would not have been wasted, Batista&#8217;s grandson (not Castro&#8217;s brother) would still be ruling Cuba and all those tin-pot dictators that the CIA supported in Central and South America over the years would be in Heaven right now &#8212; not in Hell.  And phrases like &#8220;Banana Republic&#8221; and &#8220;Military Junta&#8221; and &#8220;Drug Cartel&#8221; would all stir our hearts with pride instead of just making us queasy.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union would still exist &#8212; and Afghans and Chechyans would just love being a part of it.  People there would stop praising Tolstoy, Tchaikovsky and Baryshnikov and start even more fan clubs for Stalin.</p>
<p>We would have &#8220;Fascism&#8221; and &#8220;Corporatism&#8221; engraved on our dimes now instead of just that stupid old word &#8220;Liberty&#8221;.  And &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; &#8212; not &#8220;Romeo and Juliette&#8221; &#8212; would be required reading in all American high schools.</p>
<p>All seven billion of us human beings, when we were babies, would have been spanked every time we cried, been locked in closets for days for the slightest infraction and would have thrived on harsh whippings &#8212; and that would have been that.  And as a result we would all have grown up to become obedient citizens, not axe-murdering psychopaths.</p>
<p>Jesus would have been just another loser with wild ideas.  Even Mohammed and the Buddha would have been buked and scorned (and sent to bed without any Last Supper). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdllgBtXPaE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr></wbr>v=UdllgBtXPaE</a></p>
<p>Everyone in America would be happily welcoming the NSA and the militarization of our police forces with open arms right now.  More tanks driving down Main Street?  More surveillance on our phones?  More destruction of our Constitutional rights?  Bring it on!</p>
<p>And Baby Doc and his Bon Ton Macoute would still be running Haiti and Jean-Bertrand Aristide would have been laughed out of the country instead of becoming a hero almost as legendary as Toussaint L&#8217;Ouverture.</p>
<p>So why don&#8217;t whips and chains and oppression and torture work out so well in the long run?  One would think that they would.  Isn&#8217;t Fear the greatest motivator?  According to Gladwell, apparently not.</p>
<p>And why is &#8220;Do unto others as you would have others do unto you&#8221; still such a hot item?  You tell me.  Which way would you prefer to be treated?  As a friend or as a slave?  Which way of being treated would piss you off to the degree that you would take torches and pitchforks in hand rather than live under a tyrant?</p>

<p><strong>Unless you’ve been in an underground bunker for the last month, you’d have heard that the Ukraine has gone topsy-turvy lately.</strong></p>
<p>They seem to have escaped one old Soviet Union, only be reeled in by a new Soviet in the EU. There is also the problem of organized crime syndicates who have overrun the country.</p>
<p>Understanding the country’s recent history and following the money is important if you want to see which way the wind is blowing in Kiev…</p>
<p><strong>Stalin and Krushchev Wanted Ukraine</strong></p>
<p>For most Europeans, Ukraine is a gas transport corridor for bringing expensive Russian gas to Europe and Ukraine either overcharges Gazprom for gas transit fees, or does not pay Gazprom for the gas it takes for national consumption.</p>
<p>This Russian-Ukrainian gas game occasionally tips into gas embargoes – hitting consumers further down the line. As a geopolitical bargaining chip, conversely, Ukraine had considerable import  - <em>and weight</em> – during the Cold War period which tapered off in 1989-91. Relatively quickly, Russia withdrew “nearly all” of its nuclear-tipped missiles, atomic warheads and nuclear military equipment and component inventories from Ukraine, in the 1990s.</p>
<p>That said, Ukraine is listed by human rights and corruption watchdog NGOs as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, tied with Bangladesh, Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Syria.  Its postwar history following the defeat of Nazi Germany is a tragic story of Soviet megalomania, paranoia and oppression. The Nazi Germans probably killed about 15% of the total population, but about another 600,000 Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned in Soviet gulags or exiled to the eastern Soviet empire. Among their crimes was “non-performance” in agricultural output.</p>
<p>Administered by the rising political star and soon-to-be rival of Joseph Stalin, <strong>Nikita Khruschev</strong>, firstly in eastern Russian-speaking Ukraine, the kolkhoz collective-farm system was operated by chiefs selected by Khruschev. He empowered them to expel residents who “under-performed”. The kolkhoz chiefs quickly turned this into a racket protection and vendetta system for expelling their personal enemies, and the weak, the old and other “misfits”.  Well over 10,000 were exiled to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. For Khruschev, this was a highly effective policy which he recommended it for adoption across the USSR to Stalin, despite it periodically resulting in wide-area famines.</p>
<div>
<img alt="" src="http://orientalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ukraine.gif" width="514" height="386" /></p>
</div>
<p>Similar to the <strong>“agro-towns”</strong> attempted by Ceaucescu of Romania, Khrushchev further destabilized Ukraine’s slowly recovering agricultural output with his scheme for population regrouping, which he later applied in Russia when he became <em>Praesidium</em> chief on the death of Stalin, following a classic Mafia-style power struggle with NKVD chief Beria. Beria was shot and killed with five of his associates by order of Khrushchev in Dec 1953. One of Beria’s proposed post-Stalin reform ideas was to liberate either or both East Germany and Ukraine, in exchange for cash payment by the West</p>
<p><strong>Crime Syndicates want Ukraine</strong></p>
<p>On the surface, mainstream media tells us today’s conflict in the Ukraine pitches the Russian-speaking half of the country in the east (where ailing president Yanukovich’s main support base is) against the more pro-Western, and alleged pro-EU, Ukrainian-speaking half in the west (where imprisoned Yulia Tymoshenko’s main support base is). More precisely, the Ukraine’s rapidly-deteriorating economic situation reflected by rapidly-rising interest rates on its sovereign debt bonds and Fitch’s recent downgrade, and its near-civil war street rebellion have reinforced its organized crime syndicates. Its organized criminals, and their enemies-and-allies in Russian, Bulgarian, Romanian and other east European organized crime syndicates, are vying for control of the State itself, to widen and deepen their lucrative activity.</p>
<p>The past week has seen President Yanukovych accept the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his cabinet, repeal anti-protest laws, provide an amnesty to detained protesters, and offer senior government jobs to the opposition – offers that were rejected. Moscow for its part has threatened it may hold back some or all of a promised Ukrainian bond-bailout package and a promised cut in gas prices for Ukraine until a new government is formed. The gas price cut and the loans, totalling $15bn (11 bn euros) were agreed in December, and widely seen as rewarding Yanukovich for Kiev’s rejection of an EU associate country deal for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukraine is one of six post-Soviet nations – along with  Belarus, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia – to be invited to cooperate with the EU within a new ‘multilateral’ framework that is high on promises but slim on content. The framework seeks visa-free travel, better human rights, more democracy, and respect for the principles of the market economy and sustainable development – so say the EU websites, but the single most important economic content is a trade pact aimed at cutting tariffs and taxes, which are in any case decreasing on the Ukrainian side due to its membership of the WTO since 2009. Main EU exports to Ukraine include medicine, motor vehicles, mobile phones and other manufactured goods, while main EU imports were of low to mid-value: iron and steel products, vegetable oils, ferro-nickel ores, iron ores and crude oil.</p>
<p>Acting long before the Ukraine’s membership of the WTO, or the 2008 financial crisis – both of which spurred and favoured crime syndicate integration in east Europe, Russia and the EU – the present number of organized crime groups operating in eastern Europe is estimated at about 3,600 with each profiting from such prosaic products as household detergents, to fake medecines, human trafficking, prostiution and the Ukrainian favorites of <em>hard drugs and firearms.</em>Rob Wainwright, director of the EU’s crime-fighting agency, told the Financial Times in June 2013 that only concerning Europe’s black market in counterfeit foodstuffs, fake pharmaceuticals and substandard machine parts, this doubled in value to about €2bn since 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Arms for Drugs and Arms for Cash</strong></p>
<p>From, at latest 2002, US drug enforcement and security agencies warned the Bush administration of the <strong>Kiev-Tel Aviv-New York</strong> <strong>“Axis”</strong> of organized crime operating drugs-for-arms trades worldwide. This syndicate particularly focuses South American-source cocaine supplied by Colombia’s FARC and other Andean country crime entities, and Ukraine-source weapons and military equipment. Ukraine’s geographic role and location as a “window to the southern states” of the ex-USSR, makes it highly favoured for operating drugs-for-arms trades, today. Land-route heroin from Afghanistan, South American cocaine and Russian AK47s are the hard currencies featured by this trade.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://static.c2w.com/uploads/question/image/01/48/72/63/N1487263/1387863030.jpg" width="250" height="201" /><br />
<em>Godfather of the AK47: Ukrainian Mikhail Kalashnikov.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Ukraine’s front-line status in the Cold War and its own arms-making industries made the country a major source for Russian licit and illicit arms exports, and Soviet-era materiel is still widely available. This ranges from the “iconic” AK47 rifle through to mines, grenades and military explosive-pyrotechnic devices, to night-sighting and communications equipment, and artillery pieces through the low-end range of 35mm-105mm, to also-iconic Soviet 72-ton T72 tanks, a highly depressed market where prices can be as low as scrap value only – about $3.50 per kilogram of weight.</p>
<p>Western security analysts, preferring not to have their names published, also point out that Ukraine is a “wonderland” of nuclear civil-military crossover materials and ordnance. Following the <strong>1986 Chernobyl meltdown</strong>, then the collapse and break up of the USSR in 1989-91, they say that large amounts of unaccounted-for nuclear fuel rods, wastes and nuclear military components exist in the country. They also underline the increased technological sophistication of ex-Soviet national mafias and their Middle Eastern opposite numbers, able to produce “binary nuclear” weapons, from nuclear and non-nuclear components, transported separately to reduce detection for final re-assembly when required.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s now accelerating political destabilization creates a classic poker-game challenge for Vladimir Putin at this time. He can act to prevent the country “seceding to the West’, or being partitioned into its western and eastern parts.</p>
<p>Whether Putin clamps down or lets the country fall apart, or the domestic power struggle inside Ukraine continues with no clear winner, the transition interval will certainly feature action by organized crime to further and deepen its already-strong foothold.</p>

</div>
<p>As the Russian Sochi Winter Olympics date approaches, a wave of suicide bombings in Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad, site of the decisive resistance to German invasion in 1942), have wreaked death and uncertainty in the region. On 29 December 2013 a suicide bomber exploded at the Volgograd railway station, killing the bomber and 16 more. A day later another suicide bombing on a trolleybus killed at least 15 people. The attacks come just a few weeks before the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics begin on February 7 on the Black Sea near the border to Georgia.</p>
<p>Those most recent attacks followed an October 21 suicide attack in which a bomb carried by a female suicide bomber exploded on a passenger bus carrying 40 people. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry, reported that at least 5 people died in the blast and 17 others were injured. The suicide bomber had been identified as 30-year-old Naida Asiyalova of Dagestan. Since 1999 Mujahideen Sunni Salafists, often from Saudi Arabia or other Arab countries, have tried to incite an Islamic revolution and install Sharia law in Dagestan from neighboring Chechnya as well as in Chechnya.</p>
<p>The recent new wave of suicide bombing attacks in the region has led many to believe they are the work of radical Mujahideen Salafist Sunnis led by an erratic Jihadist from Chechnya, Doku Umarov, who sometimes goes by the Arabized name, Dokka Abu Usman. Umarov has unilaterally proclaimed himself underground President of the unrecognized Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI), and later, the self-proclaimed Emir of the Russian North Caucasus, declaring it an Islamic state of the Caucasus Emirate. In doing so he announced, “I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah in all the time that he gives me to live on this earth.” <a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn1" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
<p>In Russia he is called the “Russian bin Laden.” In March 2011, the United Nations Security Council Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee added Umarov to the list of individuals allegedly associated with al-Qaeda, the Saudi-financed loose network of international Jihadist bands which had been trained during the 1980’s Afghan war against the Soviet Union by CIA, Saudi, Israeli and Pakistani intelligence services. AL-Qaeda is a name for a database set up by Saudi intelligence to keep track of all the Arab and other Muslim mercenaries working in defeating the Russians in Afghanistan during the 1980s.</p>
<p>Umarov has claimed responsibility for gruesome suicide bombings, using women called ?black widows” whose husbands had been killed fighting Jihad against Russian security forces. Umarov openly claimed responsibility for the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings and the 2011 Domodedovo International Airport bombing in Moscow. The person who did the Metro bombing was a 17-year old Mujahideen widow, Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova</p>

<i>Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova, 17, posing with her late husband Umalat Magomedov. She became a “black widow”  suicide bomber, carrying out the Moscow metro bombings in April 2010 (Reuters)</i></p>
</div>
<p>In June 2013, Umarov called for his followers in and outside the Caucasus to use “maximum force” to ensure the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics do not take place: “They plan to hold the Olympics on the bones of our ancestors, on the bones of many, many dead Muslims buried on our land by the Black Sea. We as Mujahideen are required not to allow that, using any methods that Allah allows us.” <a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn2" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
<p>All indications point to the terrorists controlled by Umarov being behind the latest “Black Widow” suicide bombings in Volgograd. Naida Asiyalova, who blew herself up in the suicide bombing in Volgograd in October, is from Dagestan. She was reported “in love” with another suicide bomber before she “did her duty” to the jihad of Umarov. She was also a close friend of the woman implicated in the most recent Volgograd station bombing.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn3" target="_blank">[3]</a>All indications to date point to Doku Umarov’s Chechyn terrorist organization for these recent terror bombings in Russia.</p>
<p>The US State Department has just issued an Advisory Alert to US citizens going to Sochi as a response even though Volgograd is several hundred kilometers away.</p>
<p><b>Russia’s Mujahideen terrorists</b></p>
<p>Soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Halliburton, the world’s largest oil services company, then led by Dick Cheney, determined that the Caucasus and the region around the former Soviet Union’s Caspian Sea contained staggering volumes of untapped oil. Some said it was a “new Saudi Arabia.” As part of broader Washington strategy of then-president George H.W. Bush, US intelligence began moving veterans of the bloody Afghan Mujahideen campaign into the Caucasus and Caspian region to facilitate independence from the Soviet Union and open the door for US and British oil companies to control the key oil regions.</p>
<p>Two “retired” CIA operatives close to former CIA head Bush, Ted Shackley and General (Ret.) Richard Secord set up a CIA “front” fake Azeribaijan oil company called Mega Oil. It was a cover to fly in hundreds of Mujahideen veterans from Afghanistan as “oilworkers.”</p>
<p>In 1991 Richard Secord along with veterans of US operations in Laos, and later of Oliver North’s operations with the Contras, turned up in Baku, Azerbaijan under the cover of MEGA Oil. This was when George H.W. Bush supported an oil pipeline stretching from Azerbaijan across the Caucasus to Turkey. Dick Cheney was then Bush senior’s Defense Secretary. MEGA never found oil. But MEGA operatives in Azerbaijan engaged in military training, passed “brown bags filled with cash” to members of the Azeri government, and set up an airline on the model of the CIA’s Vietnam era Air America which flew hundreds of mujahedin mercenaries from Afghanistan into Azerbaijan and the Caucasus, especially Chechnya. <a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn4" target="_blank">[4]</a></p>
<p>A faction of the CIA and US intelligence tied to the neo-conservatives and the US military industrial complex, have been involved in bringing fanatical Jihadist Islam into the traditionally Sufi peaceful Islam of the Caucasus region. Osama bin Laden actively moved from Afghanistan into Bosnia, then Kosovo and on into Chechnya after 1995, where his principal ally, fellow Saudi Jihadist, Ibn al-Khattab was leader of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya fighting the Russians. Chechnya happened to be the transit region for a major Russian oil pipeline from Baku into Russia for Caspian oil, something Washington was determined to block. Journalist Ali Soufan notes that by 1996, “the United States had been on the side of Muslims in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya.”<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn5" target="_blank">[5]</a></p>
<p>At the time of the Beslan school massacre in Russia near the Georgia border in September 2004, Umarov’s Jihadists, including Arab Mujahideen, were partly financed with US money via a Washington-based NGO called ACDI/VOCA. Much of the money that the US Government-funded NGO received for the project reportedly came from a US Department of Agriculture Food for Peace Project.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn6" target="_blank">[6]</a> Apparently the food they dispensed was in the form of Kalashnikovs and hand grenades, not grain and apples.</p>
<p>According to veteran Caucasus-based journalist Jeffrey Silverman, Doku Umarov is today an “asset” controlled and guided by a Washington-based think-tank called Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn7" target="_blank">[7]</a> The board of the Potomac Institute reads like a who’s who of retired US military and intelligence people. According to Washington insider reports, Potomac is not entirely what it appears to be.</p>
<p>It is rather, these sources report, a front for Israeli intelligence, a group of US neo-conservatives, both working with Saudi Arabian intelligence. Two of Potomac’s key people involved in the Caucasus are reported to be Prof. Jonah Alexander, who heads the institute’s International Center for Terrorism Studies, and Ambassador (ret) David Smith.</p>
<p>Alexander has taught at Tel Aviv University and headed an interesting-sounding project, “Terrorism, Gray Area and Low Level Conflict,” for the US Global Strategy Council, a group founded by Ray Cline, former Deputy Director of the CIA.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn8" target="_blank">[8]</a> David J. Smith is Director of the Georgian Security Analysis Center (GSAC) at the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies in Tbilisi, Georgia. Between 2002 and 2006 Smith was US Member of the International Security Advisory Board, assisting Georgia to “build democracy and establish functional national security institutions.”<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn9" target="_blank">[9]</a>  By all indications, he did a rather poor job if that really was what he was building.</p>
<p>Many of the Arab and Chechyn Jihadist terrorists plaguing Russia in recent years have been infiltrated into Chechnya from the Pankisi Gorge region across the border in Georgia, where a pro-US Saakashvili regime at the time obviously “looked the other way.” Reportedly Saakashvili’s brother worked in London for BP, the head of the Anglo-American oil pipeline consortium that owns the BTC pipeline from Baku through Georgia to Turkey.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn10" target="_blank">[10]</a></p>
<p>Contrary to outward appearance, there has been intimate cooperation between Saudi and Israeli intelligence services on matters of common strategic interest for years. Reportedly the ties began when Prince Bandar was Saudi Ambassador to Washington.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn11" target="_blank">[11]</a></p>
<p>If all this is true, it would suggest that Umarov’s latest suicide attacks in Russia are part of a “revenge” operation of Netanyahu and Saudi Intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, to sabotage the Sochi Olympics, for Putin’s role in winning Obama away from war against Syria last fall and openly seeking a diplomatic resolution of the Iran nuclear problem. Saudi Arabia’s Bandar and Netanyahu, who admitted they were in cooperation, both were reportedly livid against Putin for sabotaging their Jihad in Syria.</p>
<p><b>Against Obama too</b></p>
<p>That the Saudis and Israel’s Netanyahu are actively working as well to sabotage Obama’s Iran diplomacy is also clear. On October 30, 2013, Sheldon Adelson, an Israeli-American billionaire with dual passports, a financier friend of Netanyahu who owns Las Vegas casinos, called on US Congress. He reportedly told his friends in Congress to pass new sanctions against Iran designed to sabotage the Iran-Obama talks. Adelson was the main financial backer in 2012 of Mitt Romney to defeat Obama, who has become a bitter Netanyahu foe. Adelson apparently feels that Obama has slowly been distancing from Bush and Cheney’s strong tilt to the hawkish US neo-conservatives tied to the US-Israeli military industrial complex around Netanyahu’s Likud Party.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn12" target="_blank">[12]</a></p>
<p>The Republican Jewish Coalition — led by GOP financial donor Sheldon Adelson — is asking its members to call their senators and urge them to pass a new round of sanctions on Iran amid efforts from top Obama administration officials to persuade Congress to delay such measures to allow time for negotiations with the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program to “gain traction.” <a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn13" target="_blank">[13]</a></p>
<p>The Volgograd bombings are a part of a global political shift taking place with factions declaring war inside major governments. Washington is split today between a “pro-Israel” faction largely in Congress, and on the opposite side, a mix of nationalists who seem to be trying to define a genuine American interest in all the wars around the world. Reportedly General Martin E. Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military’s highest body in the Pentagon, and others around President Obama are moving to distance Washington from the Saudi-Israeli war strategy which they have realized as against American interest.</p>
<p>The realization in and around the White House and State Department that the US Government was being manipulated by Israeli and Saudi false intelligence was the real reason, according to Washington reports, for the abrupt decision by President Obama last summer to halt the planned war against Syria. Obama was told that the “evidence” of a Syrian government chemical weapons attack on civilians had been doctored by Saudi and Israeli intelligence to force Obama to finally declare war. <a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn14" target="_blank">[14]</a></p>
<p>That was why Obama surprisingly and inexplicably embraced the Putin mediation offer to remove the chemical weapons and why Assad quickly agreed. Obama was himself strongly against military action in Syria. The chemicals used in Syria reportedly were supplied by Prince Bandar to the rebels, not from Syrian Government forces. <a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn15" target="_blank">[15]</a> The intelligence intercepts given President Obama purporting to be tapes of Syrian Army commanders discussing the chemical attack were given to Washington by Israeli intelligence by Israeli Defence Forces’ 8200 unit and were also reportedly faked.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn16" target="_blank">[16]</a></p>
<p>Now this same network seems to have activated a revenge attack against Putin and Obama for foiling their stratagems. It’s a high risk gamble by Netanyahu and Saudi Prince Bandar that could severely boomerang against them.</p>
<p><i>In a noteworthy footnote to the entire gruesome Doku Umarov drama, on January 17, Moscow Times reported on a social media message sent out by Chechen president, Ramzan Kadyrov, claiming that he had “new evidence” that rebel leader Doku Umarov was dead. Kadyrov wrote in an Instagram, “According to our information, Umarov is dead and we are looking for his body.” He claimed that Umarov had been killed during a Russian Special Forces operation.<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn17" target="_blank">[17]</a> The report has not been confirmed by Moscow. The Kadyrov report has to be taken with more than a little grain of salt. The flamboyant Chechyn President has issued such messages before, the last time in December, when he wrote that Umarov was “mostly likely already dead or will be soon.”<a title="" href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/01/24/is-netanyahu-getting-back-at-putin-with-volgograd-bombings/#_edn18" target="_blank">[18]</a> Whether dead or alive, it seems most likely that Doku Umarov is little more than a “cover” for the darker networks running terror against Putin’s Russia in the Caucasus, and that darker network is Moscow’s real problem.</i></p>

<p>Marriane Williamson, author of the book <em>A Return to Love</em>, announced this past fall her plan to run for Congress in the 33<sup>rd</sup>district of California to stop the “Culture of Corruption” in our nation’s capital.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, deep, systemic corruption thrives in our U.S. Congress. It flourishes in our White House.  Thomas Jefferson, our third president, tried to pass term limits, but failed in the face of those who love power and expect to maintain it.</p>
<p>Judicial Watch, the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption, released its 2013</p>
<p>List of Washington&#8217;s &#8220;Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politicians.&#8221; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.JudicialWatch.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEf7SAqVq7nvnO8IHr_vql6bohz9g" target="_blank">www.JudicialWatch.org</a> , the list, in alphabetical order, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li> Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH)</li>
<li>CIA Director John Brennan</li>
<li>Senator Saxby Chambliss</li>
<li>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</li>
<li>Attorney General Eric Holder</li>
<li>Former IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller / Former IRS Official Lois Lerner</li>
<li>Former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano</li>
<li>President Barack Obama</li>
<li>Senator Harry Reid (D-NV)</li>
<li>Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius</li>
</ul>
<p>Dishonorable Mentions for 2013 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg</li>
<li>Outgoing Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) / Incoming Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D)</li>
<li>Former Rep. Rick Renzi (R-AZ)</li>
<li>National Security Adviser Susan Rice</li>
</ul>
<p>As a 27 year old staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee, Ms. Hillary Clinton suffered firing by her supervisor, lifelong democrat Jerry Zeifman who said, “She is a liar. She was unethical and dishonest.  She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality.”</p>
<p>If you remember the murders at the U.S. embassy in Benghazi that suffered a terrorist attack that killed four people, her reply, “What difference does it matter?”</p>
<p>Mr. Barack Obama continues his cover-up of his incompetence in fortifying the embassy and ignoring all calls for help.  Good men died because of malfeasance and ineptitude.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH):</p>
<p>House Speaker John Boehner became a master at what Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer calls the “Tollbooth Strategy.” As Schweizer explains in his new book, <i>Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets:</i></p>
<p>“You pay money at a tollbooth in order to use a road or bridge. The methodology in Washington is similar: if someone wants a bill passed, charge them money to allow the bill to move down the legislative highway.”</p>
<p>According to Schweizer, Boehner used the “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Government%2F2013%2F10%2F24%2FEXTORTION-Speaker-Boehner-Collected-Tollbooth-Fee-Before-Key-Votes&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNECc93lKl_AXbMnypFEPVbAgOCGqA" target="_blank">Tollbooth Strategy” to collect more than $200,000 in political donations from executives just days before holding votes on bills critically important to their industries</a>.  Reference:<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Government%2F2013%2F10%2F24%2FEXTORTION-Speaker-Boehner-Collected-Tollbooth-Fee-Before-Key-Votes&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNECc93lKl_AXbMnypFEPVbAgOCGqA" target="_blank">http://www.breitbart.com/Big-<wbr></wbr>Government/2013/10/24/<wbr></wbr>EXTORTION-Speaker-Boehner-<wbr></wbr>Collected-Tollbooth-Fee-<wbr></wbr>Before-Key-Votes</a></p>
<p>Additionally, Boehner continues his blockade of the E-Verify Bill to force employers to check legal status of anyone seeking employment.  I suspect the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, up to its eyeballs in promoting illegal immigration cheap labor, paid big bucks to keep E-Verify from passing into law.  No doubt Marriott, Holiday Inn, Tyson Chicken, McDonald’s, Chipotle’s, Hormel, La Quinta, endless restaurant chains, construction, painting, landscape and other huge companies paid huge bribes to make sure they continue to hire illegal aliens rather than American citizens at a living wage.</p>
<p>Speaker Boehner does not stand-alone.</p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Holder lies so much, hides so much, aka, Fast and Furious, that he cannot tell the truth from a lie.</p>
<p>Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) makes the “Ten Worst” list for what he actually did in 2012, but which was finally exposed in 2013. Just as with House Speaker Boehner, Chambliss’s misdeeds were revealed in Peter Schweizer’s book, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Journalism%2F2013%2F10%2F22%2FNYT-Extortion-Reveals-Embarrassing-Info-About-What-Lawmakers-Bought-with-Donations&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHq5XDM0UMXbgHRqANu3-5aC7Zp2A" target="_blank"><i>Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes, and Line Their Own Pockets.</i></a></p>
<p>Judicial Watch said, “Chambliss is highlighted as one of the key abusers who used <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2FBig-Journalism%2F2013%2F10%2F20%2FCBS-Congress-Using-Slush-Funds-to-Bankroll-Lavish-Lifestyle&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHgXztLBomlSSuITZoOdeCJpHxcYg" target="_blank">leadership PAC loopholes</a> to convert campaign cash into lavish lifestyle upgrades for themselves and their family members<span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2013%2F10%2F22%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fquestions-about-politicians-use-of-leadership-pacs.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFef4W787hYtEDtBmcPdwTjM2WueA" target="_blank"><i>New York Times</i></a><i> </i>reported, “The book details the extravagant expenses of Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, for instance, whose leadership PAC spent $10,000 on golf at Pebble Beach, nearly $27,000 at Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse, and $107,752 at the exclusive Breakers resort in Palm Beach, Fla. The amount Mr. Chambliss spent at the Breakers in the 2012 election cycle, the book reports, is three times what the senator gave to the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the same period.”</p>
<p>Former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano may be one of the biggest liars of all. In August 2013 Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano stepped down from her post with “pride and regret” stemming from her failure to help push through the so-called “Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act.” The truth: Napolitano played a major role in doing an end run around existing immigration law by helping President Obama implement his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) directive in lieu of DREAM Act passage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.judicialwatch.org%2Fbulletins%2Fdaca-investigation%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH69tJWnkP5HjYMurkU3CX6c29hZg" target="_blank">Documents obtained</a> by Judicial Watch in June 2013 revealed that Napolitano’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) “Abandoned required background checks in 2012, adopting, instead, costly “lean and lite” procedures in effort to keep up with the flood of amnesty applications resulting from the DACA directive.”</p>
<p>The granddaddy liar of them all: Barack Hussein Obama.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama actually tops this “Top Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politicians” list for 2013 as the driving force behind so many of the misdeeds.</p>
<p>This is Obama’s seventh straight year on the list, dating back all the way to 2007 (in 2006, he earned a “Dishonorable Mention”). He is a master at catch-me-if-you-can, corrupt politics.</p>
<p>“This year, he has again acted as a one-man Congress, rewriting entire sections of federal law on his own,” said Judicial Watch.  “Not only is his administration secretive and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fhenrymiller%2F2013%2F10%2F31%2Fthe-obamas-administrations-transparent-lack-of-transparency%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHamrx86olG5Opb88qXyCA8YXe0Ig" target="_blank">dishonest</a>; its callous disregard for the rule of law undermines our constitutional republic. Examples include:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps Obama’s most outrageous actions over the past year were his continual lies about the ability of Americans to keep their own health insurance under Obamacare. According the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffreebeacon.com%2F36-times-obama-said-you-can-keep-your-health-plan%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZbl6le3guhCIwB86buk5U7MGpIA" target="_blank"><i>Free Beacon,</i></a><i> </i>Obama misled the American people a total of 36 times between 2008 and 2013 with his promise, “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.” And according to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Finvestigations.nbcnews.com%2F_news%2F2013%2F10%2F28%2F21213547-obama-admin-knew-millions-could-not-keep-their-health-insurance%3Flite&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBnTcofneP5uad_JpQDFpJI-bwpQ" target="_blank">NBC News</a>, Obama knew, even as he repeated his lie, that “more than 40 to 67 percent of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their plans, even if they liked them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us not forget Nevada Senator Harry Reid and all the senators that voted for the S744 Amnesty Bill that legalizes 20 to 25 million illegal aliens.  They and he never stood up for enforcement of internal employment laws against employers of illegal aliens, or our borders, but they bend over for big business’ cheap labor interests—against American workers.</p>
<p>Last year, Harry Reid made the Judicial Watch <i>Ten Worst</i> list for his influence-peddling scandal involving ENN Energy Group, a Chinese “green energy” company for which Reid “<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2F2012%2F08%2F31%2Fus-usa-china-reid-solar-idUSBRE87U06D20120831&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYZMmPuCm_Nb7eoePk5eFwM_HNlw" target="_blank">applied his political muscle</a>” – and which happened to be a major client of the Nevada law firm in which Reid’s son, Rory, is a principal.</p>
<p>Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts totally.  As Marriane Williams said, “We face a culture of corruption” in Washington DC that works against the interests of all Americans—but we continue voting them back into their power positions to screw all of us.  Then we wonder why our country continues an 11-year useless war, $18 trillion debt, 14 million unemployed, 48 million subsisting on food stamps, endless immigration, falling wages and vanishing Middle Class.</p>

<p><em>The events in Volgograd are part of a much larger body of events and a multi-faceted struggle that has been going on for decades as part of a cold war after the Cold War—the post-Cold War cold war, if you please—that was a result of two predominately Eurocentric world wars. When George Orwell wrote his book 1984 and talked about a perpetual war between the fictional entities of Oceania and Eurasia, he may have had a general idea about the current events that are going on in mind or he may have just been thinking of the struggle between the Soviet Union and, surrounded by two great oceans, the United States of America.</em></p>
<p>So what does Volgograd have to do with the dizzying notion presented? Firstly, it is not schizophrenic to tie the events in Volgograd to either the conflict in the North Caucasus and to the fighting in Syria or to tie Syria to the decades of fighting in the post-Soviet North Caucasus. The fighting in Syria and the North Caucuses are part of a broader struggle for the mastery over Eurasia. The conflicts in the Middle East are part of this very grand narrative, which to many seems to be so far from the reality of day to day life.</p>
<p><strong> “Bandar Bush” goes to Mother Russia</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of supporting such an assertion we will have to start with the not-so-secret visit of a shadowy Saudi regime official to Moscow. Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, the infamous Saudi terrorist kingpin and former House of Saud envoy to Washington turned intelligence guru, last visited the Russian Federation in early-December 2013. Bandar bin Sultan was sent by King Abdullah to solicit the Russian government into abandoning the Syrians. The goal of Prince Bandar was to make a deal with the Kremlin to let Damascus be overtaken by the Saudi-supported brigades that were besieging the Syrian government forces from Syria’s countryside and border regions since 2011. Bandar met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the two held closed-door discussions about both Syria and Iran at Putin’s official residence in Novo-Ogaryovo.</p>
<p>The last meeting that Bandar had with Putin was a few months earlier in July 2013. That meeting was also held in Russia. The July talks between Prince Bandar and President Putin also included Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. One would also imagine that discussion about the Iranians increased with each visit too, as Bandar certainly tried to get the Russians on bad terms with their Iranian allies.</p>
<p>After Bandar’s first meeting with President Putin, it was widely reported that the House of Saud wanted to buy Russia off. <em>Agence France-Presse</em> and <em>Reuters </em>both cited the unnamed diplomats of the Arab petro-monarchies, their March 14 lackeys in Lebanon, and their Syrian opposition puppets as saying that Saudi Arabia offered to sign a lucrative arms contract with Moscow and give the Kremlin a guarantee that the Arab petro-sheikdoms would not threaten the Russian gas market in Europe or use Syria for a gas pipeline to Europe.</p>
<p>Russia knew better than to do business with the House of Saud. It had been offered a lucrative arms deal by the Saudi regime much earlier, in 2008, to make some backdoor compromises at the expense of Iran. After the compromises were made by Moscow the House of Saud put the deal on ice. If the media leaks in AFP and <em>Reuters</em> were not tactics or lies in the first place aimed at creating tensions between the Syrian and Russian governments, the purportedly extravagant bribes to betray Syria were wasted on the ears of Russian officials.</p>
<p>The House of Saud and the undemocratic club of Arab petro-monarchies that form the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have always talked large about money. The actions of these self portrayed lords of the Arabia Peninsula have almost never matched their words and promises. To anyone who deals with them, the House of Saud and company are known for habitually making grand promises that they will never keep, especially when it comes to money. Even when money is delivered, the full amount committed is never given and much of it is stolen by their corrupt partners and cronies. Whether it is the unfulfilled 2008 arms contract with Russia that was facilitated with the involvement of Iraqi former CIA asset Iyad Allawi or the overabundant commitments of financial and logistical aid to the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples that never materialized, the Arab petro-sheikhdoms have never done more than talk grandly and then get their propagandist to write articles about their generosity and splendor. Underneath all the grandeur and sparkles there has always been bankruptcy, insecurity, and emptiness.</p>
<p>A week after the first meeting with Bandar, the Kremlin responded to the media buzz about the attempted bribe by Saudi Arabia. Yury Ushakov, one of Putin’s top aides and the former Russian ambassador to the US, categorically rejected the notion that any deal was accepted or even entertained by the Kremlin. Ushakov avowed that not even bilateral cooperation was discussed between the Saudis and Russia. According to the Kremlin official, the talks between Bandar and Putin were simply about the policies of Moscow and Riyadh on Syria and the second international peace conference being planned about Syria in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

<p><strong>More Leaks: Fighting Fire with Fire?</strong></p>
<p>If his objective was to get the Russians to abandon Syria, Prince Bandar left both meetings in Russia empty-handed. Nevertheless, his visit left a trail of unverifiable reports and speculation. Discretion is always needed when analyzing these accounts which are part of the information war about Syria being waged on all sides by the media. The planted story from the Saudi side about trying to buy the Russians was not the only account of what took place in the Russian-Saudi talks. There was also a purported diplomatic leak which most likely surfaced as a counter-move to the planted story about Bandar’s proposal. This leak elaborated even further on the meeting between Bandar and Putin. Threats were made according to the second leak that was published in Arabic by the Lebanese newspaper <em>As-Safir</em> on August 21, 2013.</p>
<p>According to the Lebanese newspaper, not only did Prince Bandar tell the Russians during their first July meeting that the regimes of the GCC would not threaten the Russian gas monopoly in Europe, but he made promises to the Russians that they could keep their naval facility on the Mediterranean coast of Syria and that he would give the House of Saud’s guarantee to protect the 2014 Winter Olympics being held in the North Caucasian resort city of Sochi, on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, from the Chechen separatist militias under Saudi control. If Moscow cooperated with Riyadh and Washington against Damascus, the leak discloses that Bandar also stated that the same Chechen militants fighting inside Syria to topple the Syrian government would not be given a role in Syria’s political future.</p>
<p>When the Russians refused to betray their Syrian allies, Prince Bandar then threatened Russia with the cancellation of the second planned peace conference in Geneva and with the unleashing of the military option against the Syrians the leak imparts.</p>
<p>This leak, which presents a veiled Saudi threat about the intended attacks on the Winter Olympics in Sochi, led to a frenzy of speculations internationally until the end of August 2013, amid the high tensions arising from the US threats to attack Syria and the threats coming from Iran to intervene on the side of their Syrians allies against the United States. Originating from the same politically affiliated media circle in Lebanon, reports about Russian military preparations to attack Saudi Arabia in response to a war against Syria began to circulate from the newspaper <em>Al-Ahed</em> also, further fueling the chain of speculations.</p>
<p><strong>A House of Saud Spin on the Neo-Con “Redirection”</strong></p>
<p>Seymour Hersh wrote in 2007 that after the 2006 defeat of Israel in Lebanon that the US government had a new strategy called the “redirection.” According to Hersh, the “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/03/05/070305fa_fact_hersh">redirection</a>” had “brought the United States closer to an open confrontation with Iran and, in parts of the region, propelled it into a widening sectarian conflict between Shiite and Sunni Muslims.” With the cooperation of Saudi Arabia and all the same players that helped launch Osama bin Ladin’s career in Afghanistan, the US government took “part in clandestine operations aimed at Iran and its <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/03/05/070305fa_fact_hersh">ally Syria</a>.” The most important thing to note is what Hersh says next: “A by-product of these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda.”</p>
<p>A new House of Saud spin on the “redirection” has begun. If there is anything the House of Saud knows well, it is rounding up fanatics as tools at the service of Saudi Arabia’s patrons in Washington. They did it in Afghanistan, they did it Bosnia, they have done it in Russia’s North Caucasus, they did it in Libya, and they are doing it in both Lebanon and Syria. It does not take the British newspaper<em>The Independent</em> to publish an article titled “<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/mass-murder-in-the-middle-east-is-funded-by-our-friends-the-saudis-8990736.html">Mass murder in the Middle East is funded by our friends the Saudis</a>” for the well-informed to realize this.</p>
<p>The terrorist bombings in Lebanon mark a new phase of the conflict in Syria, which is aimed at forcing Hezbollah to retreat from Syria by fighting in a civil war on its home turf. The attacks are part of the “redirection.” The House of Saud has accented this new phase through its ties to the terrorist attacks on the Iranian Embassy in Beirut on November 19, 2013. The attacks were carried out by individuals linked to the notorious Ahmed Al-Assir who waged a reckless battle against the Lebanese military from the Lebanese city of Sidon as part of an effort to ignite a sectarian civil war in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Al-Assir’s rise, however, was politically and logistically aided by the House of Saud and its shameless Hariri clients in Lebanon. He is also part of the same “redirection” policy and current that brought Fatah Al-Islam to Lebanon. This is why it is no surprise to see Hariri’s Future Party <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/are-al-qaedas-lebanese-affiliates-opening-a-lebanese-front-in-the-syrian-war/5340160">flag flying alongside Al-Qaeda flags</a> in Lebanon. After Al-Assir’s failed attempt to start a sectarian Lebanese civil war, he went into hiding and it was even alleged that he was taken in by one of the GCC embassies.</p>
<p>In regard to the House of Saud’s roles in the bombings in Lebanon, Hezbollah would confirm that the attack on the Iranian Embassy in Beirut was linked to the House of Saud. Hezbollah’s leadership would report that the Abdullah Izzam Brigade, which is affiliated to Al-Qaeda and tied to the bombings, is directly linked to the intelligence services of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Saudi agent, Majed Al-Majed, responsible for the attack would be apprehended by Lebanese security forces in late-December 2013. He had entered Lebanon after working with Al-Nusra in Syria. <em>Fars News Agency</em>, an Iranian media outlet, would report on January 2, 2014 that unnamed Lebanese sources had also confirmed that they had discovered that the attack was linked to Prince Bandar.</p>

<p><strong>Wrath of the House of Saud Unleashed?</strong></p>
<p>A lot changed between the first and second meetings that Prince Bandar and Vladimir Putin had, respectively in July 2013 and December 2013. The House of Saud expected its US patron to get the Pentagon involved in a conventional bombing campaign against Syria in the month of September. It is more than likely that Riyadh was in the dark about the nature of secret negotiations that the US and Iran were holding through the backchannel of Oman in the backdrop of what appeared to be an escalation towards open war.</p>
<p>Bandar’s threat to reassess the House of Saud’s ties with Washington is probably a direct result of the US government keeping the House of Saud in the dark about using Syria as a means of negotiating with the Iranian government. US officials may have instigated the House of Saud to intensify its offensive against Syria to catalyze the Iranians into making a deal to avoid an attack on Syria and a regional war. Moreover, not only did the situation between the US and Iran change, Russia would eventually sign an important energy contract for Syrian natural gas in the Mediterranean Sea. The House of Saud has been undermined heavily in multiple ways and it is beginning to assess its own expendability.<em></em></p>
<p>If one scratches deep enough, they will find that the same ilk that attacked the Iranian Embassy in Beirut also attacked the Russian Embassy in Damascus. Both terrorist attacks were gifts to Iran and Russia, which served as reprisals for the Iranian and Russian roles in protecting Syria from regime change and a destructive war. It should, however, be discerned if the House of Saud is genuinely lashing out at Iran and Russia or if it being manipulated to further the goals of Washington in the US negotiations with Tehran, Moscow, and Damascus.</p>
<p>In the same manner, the House of Saud wants to generously reward Hezbollah too for its role in protecting Syria by crippling Hezbollah domestically in Lebanon. Riyadh may possibly not want a full scale war in Lebanon like the Israelis do, but it does want to neutralize and eliminate Hezbollah from the Lebanese landscape. In this regard, Saudi Arabia has earnestly been scheming to recruit Lebanon’s President Michel Suleiman and the Lebanese military against Hezbollah and its supporters.</p>
<p>The Saud grant of three billion dollars to the Lebanese Armed Forces is not only blood money being given to Lebanon as a means of exonerating Saudi Arabia for its role in the terrorist bombings that have gripped the Lebanese Republic since 2013, the Saudi money is also aimed at wishfully restructuring the Lebanese military as a means of using it to neutralize Hezbollah. In line with the House of Saud’s efforts, pledges from the United Arab Emirates and reports that NATO countries are also planning on donating money and arms to the Lebanese military started.</p>
<p>In addition to the terrorists bombings in Lebanon and the attack on the Russian Embassy in Damascus, Russia has also been attacked. Since the Syrian conflict intensified there has been a flaring of tensions in Russia’s North Caucasus and a breakout of terrorist attacks. Russian Muslim clerics, known for their views on co-existence between Russia’s Christian and Muslim communities and anti-separatist views, have been murdered. The bombings in Volgograd are just the most recent cases and an expansion into the Volga of what is happening in the North Caucasus, but they come disturbingly close to the start of the Winter Olympics that Prince Bandar was saying would be “protected” if Moscow betrayed Syria.</p>
<p><strong>Can the House of Saud Stand on its Own Feet?</strong></p>
<p>It is a widely believed that you will find the US and Israelis pulling a lot of the strings if you look behind the dealings of the House of Saud. That view is being somewhat challenged now. Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the UK, threatened that Saudi Arabia will go it alone against Syria and Iran in a December 2013 article. The letter, like the Saudi rejection of their UN Security Council seat, was airing the House of Saud’s rage against the realists running US foreign policy.</p>
<p>In this same context, it should also be noted for those that think that Saudi Arabia has zero freedom of action that Israeli leaders have stressed for many years that Tel Aviv needs to <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-secret-wars-of-the-saudi-israeli-alliance/24744">cooperate secretly with Saudi Arabia</a> to manipulate the US against Iran. This is epitomized by the words of Israeli Brigadier-General Oded Tira: “We must clandestinely cooperate with Saudi Arabia so that it also persuades the US to strike Iran.”</p>
<p>Along similar lines, some may point out that <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-secret-wars-of-the-saudi-israeli-alliance/24744">together the House of Saud and Israel</a> got France to delay an interim nuclear agreement between the Iranians and the P5+1 in Geneva. The House of Saud rewarded Paris through lucrative deals, which includes making sure that the grant it gives to the Lebanese military is spent on French military hardware. Saad Hariri, the main Saudi client in Lebanon, even met Francois Hollande and French officials in Saudi Arabia in context of the deal. Appeasing the House of Saud and Israel, French President Hollande has replicated France’s stonewalling of the P5+1 interim nuclear deal with Iran by trying to spoil the second Syria peace conference in Geneva by saying that there can be no political solution inside Syria if President Bashar Al-Assad stays in power.</p>

<p>Again, however, it has to be asked, is enraging Saudi Arabia part of a US strategy to make the Saudis exert maximum pressure on Tehran, Moscow, and Damascus so that the United States can optimize its gains in negotiations? After all, it did turn out that the US was in league with France in Geneva and that the US used the French stonewalling of an agreement with Iran to make additional demands from the Iranians during the negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov revealed that the US negotiation team had actually circulated a draft agreement that had been amended in response to France’s demands before Iran and the other world powers even had a chance to study them. The draft by the US team was passed around, in Foreign Minister Lavrov’s own words, “literally at the last moment, when we were about to leave Geneva.”</p>
<p>Instead of debating on the level of independence that the House of Saud possesses, it is important to ask if Saudi Arabia can act on its own and to what degree can the House of Saud act as an independent actor. This looks like a far easier question to answer. It is highly unlikely that Saudi Arabia can act on its own in most instances or even remain an intact state. This is why Israeli strategists very clearly state that Saudi Arabia is destined to fall apart. “The entire Arabian Peninsula is a natural candidate for dissolution due to internal and external pressures, and the matter is inevitable especially in Saudi Arabia,” the Israeli Yinon Plan deems. Strategists in Washington are also aware of this and this is also why they have <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/plans-for-redrawing-the-middle-east-the-project-for-a-new-middle-east/3882">replicated models of a fragmented Saudi Arabia</a>. This gives rise to another important question: if they US assess that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not a sustainable entity, will it use it until the burns out like a flame? Is this what is happening and is Saudi Arabia being sacrificed or setup to take the blame as the “fall guy” by the United States?</p>
<p><strong>Who is</strong> <strong>Hiding Behind the House of Saud?</strong></p>
<p>Looking back at Lebanon, the messages from international media outlets via their headlines is that the bombings in Lebanon highlight or reflect a power struggle between the House of Saud and Tehran in Lebanon and the rest of the region. Saying nothing about the major roles of the US, Israel, and their European allies, these misleading reports by the likes of journalists like Anne Barnard casually blame everything in Syria and Lebanon on a rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, erasing the entire history behind what has happened and casually sweeping all the interests behind the conflict(s) under the rug. This is dishonest and painting a twisted Orientalist narrative.</p>
<p>The outlets trying to make it sound like all the Middle East’s problems are gravitating around some sort of Iranian and Saudi rivalry might as well write that “the Saudis and Iranians are the sources behind the Israeli occupation of Palestine, the sources behind the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq that crippled the most advanced Arab country, the ones that are blockading medication from reaching Gaza due to their rivalry, the ones who enforced a no-fly zone over Libya, the ones that are launching killer drone attacks on Yemen, and the ones that are responsible for the billions of dollars that disappeared from the Iraqi Treasury in 2003 after Washington and London invaded that country and controlled its finances.” These outlets and reports are tacitly washing the hands of  actors like Washington, Tel Aviv, Paris, and London clean of blood by trying to construct a series of false narratives that either blame everything on a regional rivalry between Tehran and Riyadh or the premise that the Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims are fighting an eternal war that they are biologically programmed to wage against one another.</p>
<p>Arabs and Iranians and Shias and Sunnis are tacitly painted as un-human creatures that cannot be understood and savages to audiences. <em>The New York Times</em> even dishonestly implies that the Sunni Muslims and Shiite Muslims in Lebanon are killing one another in tit-for-tat attacks. It sneakily implies that Hezbollah and its Lebanese rivals are assassinating one another. Bernard, its reporter in Lebanon who was mentioned earlier, along with another colleague <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/world/middleeast/lebanon.html">write</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In what have been seen as tit-for-tat attacks, car bombs have targeted Hezbollah-dominated neighborhoods in the southern suburbs of Beirut and Sunni mosques in the northern city of Tripoli.</p>
<p>On Friday, a powerful car bomb killed Mohamad B. Chatah, a former Lebanese finance minister who was a major figure in the Future bloc, a political group that is Hezbollah’s main Sunni rival.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> is cunningly trying to make its readers think that Hezbollah was responsible for the bombing as part of a Shiite-Sunni sectarian conflict by concluding with an explanation that the slain former Lebanese finance minister belonged to “Hezbollah’s main Sunni rival” after saying that the bombings in Lebanon “have been seen as tit-for-tat attacks” between the areas that support Hezbollah and “Sunni mosques” in Tripoli</p>
<p>The US and Israel wish that a Shiite-Sunni sectarian conflict was occurring in Lebanon and the rest of the Middle East. They have been working for this. It has been them that have been manipulating Saudi Arabia to instigate sectarianism. The US and Israel have been prodding the House of Saud—which does not represent the Sunni Muslims, let alone the people of Saudi Arabia which are under its occupation—against Iran, all the while trying to conceal and justify the conflict being instigated as some sort of “natural” rivalry between Shiites and Sunnis that is being played out across the Middle East. <strong></strong></p>
<p>It has been assessed with high confidence by outsiders concerned by the House of Saud’s inner dealings that Prince Bandar is one of the three Al-Saud princes managing Saudi Arabia’s security and foreign policy; the other two being Prince Abdulaziz bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, the Saudi deputy foreign minister and one of King Abdullah’s point men on Syria due to his ties to Syria from his maternal side, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, the interior minister. All three of them are tied to the United States more than any of their predecessors. Prince Bandar himself has a long history of working closely with the United States, which explains the endearing moniker of “Bandar Bush” that he is widely called by. “<a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/saudi-chemical-behind-syrian-attack-421/">Chemical Bandar</a>” can be added to the list too, because of the reports about his ties to the Syrian chemical weapon attacks in<a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/saudi-chemical-behind-syrian-attack-421/"> Ghouta</a>.</p>
<p>As a US client, Saudi Arabia is a source of instability because it has been conditioned hence by Washington. Fighting the terrorist and extremist threat is now being used by the US as a point of convergence with Iran, which coincidently has authored the World Against Violence and Extremism (WAVE) motion at the United Nations. In reality, the author of the regional problems and instability has been Washington itself. In a masterstroke, the realists now at the helm of foreign policy are pushing American-Iranian rapprochement on the basis of what Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security advisor of the US, said would be based on Tehran and Washington working together to secure Iran’s “volatile regional environment.” “Any eventual reconciliation [between the US and Iranian governments] should be based on the recognition of a mutual strategic interest in stabilizing what currently is a very volatile regional environment for Iran,” he explains. The point should not be lost either that Brzezinski is the man who worked with the Saudis to arm the Afghan Mujahedeen against the Soviets after he organized an intelligence operation to fool the Soviets into militarily entering Afghanistan in the first place.</p>
<p>The House of Saud did not work alone in Afghanistan during the Cold War either. It was rigorously backed by Washington. The United States was even more involved in the fighting. It is the same in Syria. If the diplomatic leak is to be believed about the meeting between Bandar and Putin, it is of merit to note that “Bandar Bush” told Putin that any “Saudi-Russian understanding” would also be part of an “American-Russian understanding.”</p>
<p><strong>Has the “Redirection” Seen its Stalingrad?</strong></p>
<p>Volgograd was called Stalingrad for a part of Soviet history, in honour of the Republic of Georgia’s most famous son and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. It was Volgograd, back then called Stalingrad, where the Germans were stopped and the tide of war in Europe was turned against Hitler and his Axis allies in Europe. The Battle of Stalingrad was where the Nazis were defeated and it was in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe where the bulk of the fighting against the Germans was conducted. Nor is it any exaggeration to credit the Soviets—Russian, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tajik, Tartar, Georgian, Armenian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Chechen, and all—for doing most of the fighting to defeat the Germans in the Second World War.</p>
<p>Judging by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G-FCFh15As">bellicose 2013 New Years Eve speech</a> of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the terrorist attacks in Volgograd will be the start of another Battle of Stalingrad of some sorts and the launch of another Russian “war on terror.” Many of the terrorists that Russia will go after are in Syria and supported by the House of Saud.</p>
<p>The opponents of the Resistance Bloc that Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and the Palestinian resistance groups form have called the battlefields in Syria the Stalingrad of Iran and its regional allies. Syria has been a Stalingrad of some sorts too, but not for the Resistance Bloc. The alliance formed by the US, Britain, France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and Israel has begun to unravel in its efforts to enforce regime change in Syria. The last few years have marked the beginning of a humiliating defeat for those funding extremism, separatism, and terrorism against countries like Russia, China, Iran, and Syria as a means of preventing Eurasian cohesion. Another front of this same battle is being politically waged by the US and the EU in the Ukraine in a move to prevent the Ukrainians from integrating with Belarus, Russia, and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p><strong>Volgograd and the Conquest of Eurasia</strong></p>
<p>While speculation has been entertained with warning in this text, most of what has been explained has not been speculative. The House of Saud has had a role in destabilizing the Russian Federation and organizing terrorist attacks inside Russia. Support or oppose the separatist movements in the North Caucasus, the point is that they have been opportunistically aided and used by the House of Saud and Washington. Despite the authenticity of the narrative about Bandar’s threats against Russia, Volgograd is about Syria and Syria is about Volgograd. Both are events taking place as part of the same struggle. The US has been trying to encroach into Syria as a means of targeting Russia and encroaching deeper in the heart of Eurasia.</p>
<p>When George Orwell wrote <em>1984</em> he saw the world divided into several entities at constant or “eternal” war with one another. His fictitious superstates police language, use total surveillance, and utterly manipulate mass communication to indoctrinate and deceive their peoples. Roughly speaking, Orwell’s <em>Oceania</em> is formed by the US and its formal and informal territories in the Western Hemisphere, which the Monroe Doctrine has essentially declared are US colonies, confederated with Britain and the settler colonies-cum-dominions of the former British Empire (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa). The Orwellian concept of <em>Eurasia</em> is an amalgamation of the Soviet Union with continental Europe. The entity of <em>Eastasia</em> on the other hand is formed around China. Southeast Asia, India, and the parts of Africa that do not fall under the influence of <em>Oceanic</em> South Africa are disputed territory that is constantly fought for. Although not specifically mentioned, it can be extrapolated that Southwest Asia, where Syria is located, or parts of it are probably part of this fictional disputed territory, which includes North Africa.</p>
<p>If we try to fit Orwellian terms onto the present set of global relations, we can say that <em>Oceania</em> has made its moves against <em>Eurasia/Eastasia</em> for control of disputed territory (in the Middle East and North Africa).</p>
<p><em>1984</em> is not just a novel, it is a warning from the farseeing Orwell. Nonetheless, never did he imagine that his <em>Eurasi</em>a would make cause with or include <em>Eastasia</em> through a core triple alliance and coalition comprised of Russia, China, and Iran. <em>Eurasia </em>will finish, in one way or another, what<em>Oceania</em> has started. All the while, as the House of Saud and the other rulers of the Arab petro-sheikhdoms continue to compete with one another in building fancy towers, the Sword of Damocles is getting heavier over their heads.</p>

<p>2014 is upon us. For a person who graduated from Georgia Tech in 1961, a year in which the class ring showed the same date right side up or upside down, the 21st century was a science fiction concept associated with Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film, “2001: A Space Odyssey.” To us George Orwell’s 1984 seemed so far in the future we would never get there. Now it is 30 years in the past.</p>
<p>Did we get there in Orwell’s sense? In terms of surveillance technology, we are far beyond Orwell’s imagination. In terms of the unaccountability of government, we exceptional and indispensable people now live a 1984 existence. In his alternative to the Queen’s Christmas speech, Edward Snowden made the point that a person born in the 21st century will never experience privacy. For new generations the word privacy will refer to something mythical, like a unicorn.</p>
<p>Many Americans might never notice or care. I remember when telephone calls were considered to be private. In the 1940s and 1950s the telephone company could not always provide private lines. There were “party lines” in which two or more customers shared the same telephone line. It was considered extremely rude and inappropriate to listen in on someone’s calls and to monopolize the line with long duration conversations.</p>
<p>The privacy of telephone conversations was also epitomized by telephone booths, which stood on street corners, in a variety of public places, and in “filling stations” where an attendant would pump gasoline into your car’s fuel tank, check the water in the radiator, the oil in the engine, the air in the tires, and clean the windshield. A dollar’s worth would purchase 3 gallons, and $5 would fill the tank.</p>
<p>Even in the 1980s and for part of the 1990s there were lines of telephones on airport waiting room walls, each separated from the other by sound absorbing panels. Whether the panels absorbed the sounds of the conversation or not, they conveyed the idea that calls were private.</p>
<p>The notion that telephone calls are private left Americans’ consciousness prior to the NSA listening in. If memory serves, it was sometime in the 1990s when I entered the men’s room of an airport and observed a row of men speaking on their cell phones in the midst of the tinkling sound of urine hitting water and noises of flushing toilets. The thought hit hard that privacy had lost its value.</p>
<p>I remember when I arrived at Merton College, Oxford, for the first term of 1964. I was advised never to telephone anyone whom I had not met, as it would be an affront to invade the privacy of a person to whom I was unknown. The telephone was reserved for friends and acquaintances, a civility that contrasts with American telemarketing.</p>
<p>The efficiency of the Royal Mail service protected the privacy of the telephone. What one did in those days in England was to write a letter requesting a meeting or an appointment. It was possible to send a letter via the Royal Mail to London in the morning and to receive a reply in the afternoon. Previously it had been possible to send a letter in the morning and to receive a morning reply, and to send another in the afternoon and receive an afternoon reply.</p>
<p>When one flies today, unless one stops up one’s ears with something, one hears one’s seat mate’s conversations prior to takeoff and immediately upon landing. Literally, everyone is talking nonstop. One wonders how the economy functioned at such a high level of incomes and success prior to cell phones. I can remember being able to travel both domestically and internationally on important business without having to telephone anyone. What has happened to America that no one can any longer go anywhere without constant talking?</p>
<p>If you sit at an airport gate awaiting a flight, you might think you are listening to a porn film. The overhead visuals are usually Fox “News” going on about the need for a new war, but the cell phone audio might be young women describing their latest sexual affair.</p>
<p>Americans, or many of them, are such exhibitionists that they do not mind being spied upon or recorded. It gives them importance. According to Wikipedia, Paris Hilton, a multimillionaire heiress, posted her sexual escapades online, and Facebook had to block users from posting nude photos of themselves. Sometime between my time and now people ceased to read 1984. They have no conception that a loss of privacy is a loss of self. They don’t understand that a loss of privacy means that they can be intimidated, blackmailed, framed, and viewed in the buff. Little wonder they submitted to porno-scanners.</p>
<p>The loss of privacy is a serious matter. The privacy of the family used to be paramount. Today it is routinely invaded by neighbors, police, Child Protective Services (sic), school administrators, and just about anyone else.</p>
<p>Consider this: A mother of six and nine year old kids sat in a lawn chair next to her house watching her kids ride scooters in the driveway and cul-de-sac on which they live.</p>
<p>Normally, this would be an idyllic picture. But not in America. A neighbor, who apparently did not see the watching mother, called the police to report that two young children were outside playing without adult supervision. Note that the next door neighbor, a woman, did not bother to go next door to speak with the mother of the children and express her concern that they children were not being monitored while they played. The neighbor called the police. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/mom-sues-polices-she-arrested-letting-her-kids-134628018.html" target="_blank">http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/mom-sues-polices-she-arrested-letting-her-kids-134628018.html<br />
</a><br />
“We’re here for you,” the cops told the mother, who was carried off in handcuffs and spent the next 18 hours in a cell in prison clothes.</p>
<p>The news report doesn’t say what happened to the children, whether the father appeared and insisted on custody of his offspring or whether the cops turned the kids over to Child Protective Services.</p>
<p>This shows you what Americans are really like. Neither the neighbor nor the police had a lick of sense. The only idea that they had was to punish someone. This is why America has the highest incarceration rate and the highest total number of prison inmates in the entire world. Washington can go on and on about “authoritarian” regimes in Russia and China, but both countries have far lower prison populations than “freedom and democracy” America.</p>
<p>I was unaware that laws now exist requiring the supervision of children at play. Children vary in their need for supervision. In my day supervision was up to the mother’s judgment. Older children were often tasked with supervising the younger. It was one way that children were taught responsibility and developed their own judgment.</p>
<p>When I was five years old, I walked to the neighborhood school by myself. Today my mother would be arrested for child endangerment.</p>
<p>In America punishment falls more heavily on the innocent, the young, and the poor than it does on the banksters who are living on the Federal Reserve’s subsidy known as Quantitative Easing and who have escaped criminal liability for the fraudulent financial instruments that they sold to the world. Single mothers, depressed by the lack of commitment of the fathers of their children, are locked away for using drugs to block out their depression. Their children are seized by a Gestapo institution, Child Protective Services, and end up in foster care where many are abused.</p>
<p>According to numerous press reports, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 year-old children who play cowboys and indians or cops and robbers during recess and raise a pointed finger while saying “bang-bang” are arrested and carried off to jail in handcuffs as threats to their classmates. In my day every male child and the females who were “Tom boys” would have been taken to jail. Playground fights were normal, but no police were ever called. Handcuffing a child would not have been tolerated.</p>
<p>From the earliest age, boys were taught never to hit a girl. In those days there were no reports of police beating up teenage girls and women or body slamming the elderly. To comprehend the degeneration of the American police into psychopaths and sociopaths, go online and observe the video of Lee Oswald in police custody in 1963. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDDuRSgzFk Oswald was believed to have assassinated President John F. Kennedy and murdered a Dallas police officer only a few hours previously to the film. Yet he had not been beaten, his nose wasn’t broken, and his lips were not a bloody mess. Now go online and pick from the vast number of police brutality videos from our present time and observe the swollen and bleeding faces of teenage girls accused of sassing overbearing police officers.</p>
<p>In America today people with power are no longer accountable. This means citizens have become subjects, an indication of social collapse.</p>

			<p><strong><em>The Legend of “Nostradamus, Jr.” continues&#8230;</em></strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/nostradamus-3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>Most predictions about the future are risky attempts at guessing. If one is fortunate, they come across a clairvoyant, who has a long established record of forecasting political prospects. In the long tradition of prognostication, by the one and only, Nostradamus, Jr., William B. Kaliher presents his 2014 prophecy. The yearly feature on the <a href="http://etherzone.com/cgi-bin/search/search.pl?Terms=%22William+Kaliher%22&amp;I1.x=22&amp;I1.y=8&amp;sort-method=3">EtherZone</a> site produced a loyal following of eager future deprived junkies. Taking pleasure in continuing this esteem exercise in sarcasm, Stuck on Stupid offers commentary on a sample of these mystic omens, which can be found on <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/010114.html">&#8220;Nostradamus, Jr.&#8221; Kaliher’s Annual Top 101 Predictions for 2014</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Inquiries begin to see if a foreign born can become U.S. President.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>95. Joe Biden will refer to the Prez using the &#8220;N&#8221; word and fellow liberals will justify his racist remark by claiming Biden has grown in office.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Obama claims he has matured as a white in office and is now under attack by his former brothers.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>96. Some liberal Democrats will be removed from management positions in the Republican National Committee.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The GOP big tent collapses as a failure.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>100. Barry Obama will set new records funding Green companies, including Alaskan Palm Orchards, Ltd., Arizona Cactus From South Georgia Swampland, Inc., Sliced &amp; Diced Rare Birds of Yet-More Wind Propellers, Corp., owned by friends and political allies.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Obama reaches out to Gore to fund his retirement and provide the ex-VP with protection.</p></blockquote>
<p>This list was selected as the tame examples. If you are daring, read the <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/010114.html">entire 101 items.</a> A serious analysis and critical review of politics is mostly ignored by the general public. The popular culture is made up of people who cannot learn, of fools who repeat their mistakes time and again, and persons who constantly screw up.</p>
<p>The art in satire varies with the source and even more with the audience. Mr. Kaliher’s perspective may seem twisted to an apologist for the establishment. It might seem downright hostile to the statist, who places trust in government. However, the continual absurdity, year after year, just grows.</p>
<p>Both in the irony of the illustrations and in the intensity of the deranged circumstances, what comes out of the political class of illusionists, is even more frightening. Truth is stranger than fiction. Yet the refusal to admit the con game that is played on citizens is the primary reason that it never ends.</p>
<p>Accepting a corrupt system as normal or inevitable is defeatist to the core. Each generation of public officials move closer to act as irrelevant puppets and lap dog administers for the dictates of perverted elites. Is there humor in this act or is it beyond the abilities of the system to provide a correcting mechanism to reverse the unwavering descent into the ridiculous.</p>
<p>So what are the reasonable expectations for 2014? Will the Republicans take the Senate? Will an amnesty immigration bill pass? Or will the administration find a magic medicine to cure Obamacare? The score card usually misses the final outcome of the game.</p>
<p>When drawn together, all the Nostradamus, Jr. Predictions for the last ten years, the picture seems far more enlightening than entertaining. The sorry state of affairs, when considered as a continual trend towards a loss in quality of life, is the only conclusion possible. Only a lazy meathead refuses to face the facts and adjust behavior when the seer speaks.</p>

<p>The CIA really screwed up back in 1961 when it plotted to murder Patrice Lumumba &#8212; and just look at the mess they created in all of central Africa as a result, even today.  The CIA also blew it bigtime when it assassinated the democratically-elected president of Iran back in 1952 &#8212; and Iran has pretty much been one of the CIA&#8217;s biggest headaches ever since.</p>
<p>And of course there was also the CIA&#8217;s famous Mandela fiasco &#8212; wherein &#8220;The Company&#8221; supported apartheid in South Africa and schemed to have Mandela thrown in jail.  No wonder Raul Castro was so welcome at Mandela&#8217;s funeral.  Cuba was a major anti-apartheid player, while the CIA once again stood on the wrong side of history, supported the Bad Guys and helped engineer the evils of bantustans, mass torture, dumpasses and the cold-blooded slaughter of school girls &#8212; plus the CIA, like one other dynasty I could mention right now, also put out false propaganda that South Africa was awash with happy Blacks picking cotton.</p>
<p>The CIA&#8217;s next total blunder took place in Chile.  How many thousands and thousands were tortured and killed there for no reason as a result of CIA interference in a democratically-elected government there?  According to the Washington Post, the number was 32,197 &#8212; but we may never know the real statistics for sure.  Let&#8217;s list Chile as another political (and moral) failure for &#8220;The Agency&#8221;.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even get me started on Vietnam.  Or Cambodia.  A land-war in Asia?  Never a good idea.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the CIA&#8217;s disgusting and ugly ongoing disaster in Central America, starting in 1954 when the CIA drew up a &#8220;<a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/guatemala/list.htm">disposal list</a>&#8221; to systematically assassinate 58 of Guatemala&#8217;s democratically-elected leaders in order to install the worst sort of dictators there.  This illegal and immoral strategy eventually cost American taxpayers untold billions of dollars &#8212; yet another big &#8220;Fail&#8221; for the &#8220;Certified Incompetents of America&#8221;.</p>
<p>And even today, when farmers in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala go out to plow their fields, they are still finding silent graves filled with whitened bones planted there by CIA-backed Death Squads.  That whole decade of the 1980s was just one big blood bath after another in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.  I shudder to even think about it.  So much shame is there.  And so much bad PR for America.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s not forget Iraq either, the CIA at its very lowest ebb.  False intel there.  A trillion dollars frittered away on creating corpses &#8212; a million of them by some counts.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>And the CIA-backed neo-cons in Israel have also been a big failure.  Those IDF blackshirts have turned out to be nothing more than Cossacks in sheep&#8217;s clothing as they run their viscous pogroms through the <span>Christian and Muslim shtetls of the West Bank and Gaza <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roitov.com%2Farticles%2Fmandela.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2S6GBb9pCaWFqQnMK0hFjTzfKUQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.roitov.com/<wbr></wbr>articles/mandela.htm</a></span>.</p>
<p>Not to mention <a href="http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/21159-focus-the-only-thing-we-have-to-fearis-the-cia">CIA failures in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Belfast, Beirut, Georgia, Cuba, Grenada and Dallas</a>.  You can always count on the CIA to back the wrong players and/or play the wrong game.  The whole Middle East is in flames today, thanks to the CIA.  Not to mention the alleged blow-back in 2001 at the World Trade Center &#8212; or was that just another one of the CIA&#8217;s failed war games too?  Either way, America also lost bigtime here due to the CIA.  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theamericanconservative.com%2Farticles%2Fcias-colossal-flop%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZw_FpU3rZY1ckTq78WRQtU1NwrA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.<wbr></wbr>theamericanconservative.com/<wbr></wbr>articles/cias-colossal-flop/ </a></p>

<p>Imagine if &#8220;The Agency&#8221; had been around during the 1776 Revolution!  With the kind of help that it has to offer, we&#8217;d still be saluting the Queen and sipping High Tea.  And the CIA would have just loved George Armstrong Custer.  &#8220;There are not enough Indians in the world to defeat the Seventh Cavalry.&#8221;  Sounds like CIA spies wrote that report.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Jane,&#8221; you might ask, &#8220;if the CIA has had so many abominable black marks against it and such dismal failures on its books, how come &#8216;The Company&#8217; hasn&#8217;t gone bankrupt yet?&#8221;  That&#8217;s a very good question.  If any other corporation in America had failed its customers this often, abysmally and immorally, one would think that it would have been forced to go bankrupt a long time ago.  Its publicly-traded stock would have been worthless and laughed at.  But not this &#8220;Company&#8221;.  Apparently the CIA leads a very charmed life.</p>
<p>I occasionally wish that I could do something like that too &#8212; start a business and know for sure and always that no matter what wrong thing I would ever do with it, what ever bad business decision I would ever make or how often I would horribly screw up, I would still automatically make almost a hundred billion a year anyway.  Wouldn&#8217;t that be cool &#8212; to just sit back and receive corporate welfare like &#8220;The Agency&#8221; does, no matter how badly I blow it.  Those CIA people certainly do have it all going on.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Jane,&#8221; you might also ask, &#8220;the CIA is a government operation, not a corporation.&#8221;  Yeah right.  You just keep telling yourself that.  The CIA never has to answer to We the People.  It answers only to the corporations that own it.  That&#8217;s not &#8220;government&#8221;.  Government, in a true democracy, must be of service to its people.  And how the freak have We ever been served by having America&#8217;s reputation shredded to ribbons throughout the world?</p>

<p>Washington has had the US at war for 12 years: Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Pakistan, Yemen, and almost Syria, which could still happen, with Iran waiting in the wings. These wars have been expensive in terms of money, prestige, and deaths and injuries of both US soldiers and the attacked civilian populations. None of these wars appears to have any compelling reason or justifiable explanation. The wars have been important to the profits of the military/security complex. The wars have provided cover for the construction of a Stasi police state in America, and the wars have served Israel’s interest by removing obstacles to Israel’s annexation of the entire West Bank and southern Lebanon. </p>
<p>As costly and destructive as these wars have been, they are far below the level of a world war, much less a world war against nuclear armed opponents. </p>
<p>The fatal war for humanity is the war with Russia and China toward which Washington is driving the US and Washington’s NATO and Asian puppet states. There are a number of factors contributing to Washington’s drive toward the final war, but the overarching one is the doctrine of American exceptionalism. </p>
<p>According to this self-righteous doctrine, America is the indispensable country. What this means is that the US has been chosen by history to establish the hegemony of secular “democratic capitalism” over the world. The primacy of this goal places the US government above traditional morality and above all law, both its own and international.</p>
<p>Thus, no one in the US government has been held accountable for unprovoked aggression against other countries and for attacking civilian populations, unambiguous war crimes under international law and the Nuremberg standard. Neither has anyone in the US government been held accountable for torture, a prohibited crime under US law and the Geneva Conventions. Neither has anyone been held accountable for numerous violations of constitutional rights&#8211;spying without warrants, warrantless searches, violations of habeas corpus, murder of citizens without due process, denial of legal representation, conviction on secret evidence. The list is long.</p>
<p>A person might wonder what is exceptional and indispensable about a government that is a reincarnation of Nazi Germany in every respect. People propagandized into the belief that they are the world’s special people inevitably lose their humanity. Thus, as the US military video released by Bradley Manning reveals, US troops get their jollies by mowing down innocent people as they walk along a city street. </p>
<p>With the exception of the ACLU, constitutional rights groups and independent Internet voices, the American people including the Christian churches have accepted their government’s criminality and immorality with scant protest. </p>
<p>The absence of moral denunciation emboldens Washington which is now pushing hard against Russia and China, the current governments of which stand in the way of Washington’s world hegemony. </p>
<p>Washington has been working against Russia for 22 years ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In violation of the Reagan-Gorbachev agreement, Washington expanded NATO into Eastern Europe and the Baltic states and established military bases on Russia’s borders. Washington is also seeking to extend NATO into former constituent parts of Russia itself such as Georgia and Ukraine. </p>
<p>The only reason for Washington to establish military and missile bases on Russia’s frontiers is to negate Russia’s ability to resist Washington’s hegemony. Russia has made no threatening gestures toward its neighbors, and with the sole exception of Russia’s response to Georgia’s invasion of South Ossetia, has been extremely passive in the face of US provocations. </p>
<p>This is now changing. Faced with the George W. Bush regime’s alternation of US war doctrine, which elevated nuclear weapons from a defensive, retaliatory use to pre-emptive first strike, together with the construction on Russia’s borders of US anti-ballistic missile bases and Washington’s weaponization of new technologies, has made it clear to the Russian government that Washington is setting up Russia for a decapitating first strike.</p>
<p>In his presidential address to the Russian National Assembly (both chambers of parliament) on December 12, Vladimir Putin addressed the offensive military threat that Washington poses to Russia. Putin said that Washington calls its anti-ballistic missile system defensive, but “in fact it is a signifiant part of the strategic offensive potential” and designed to tip the balance of power in Washington’s favor. Having acknowledged the threat, Putin replied to the threat: “Let no one have illusions that he can achieve military superiority over Russia. We will never allow it.”</p>
<p>Faced with the Obama regime’s murder of the nuclear weapons reduction treaty, Putin said: “We realize all this and know what we need to do.” </p>
<p>If anyone remains to write a history, the Obama regime will be known as the regime that resurrected the cold war, which President Reagan worked so hard to end, and drove it into a hot war.</p>
<p>Not content to make Russia an enemy, the Obama regime has also made an enemy of China. The Obama regime declared the South China Sea to be an area of “US national security interest.” This is akin to China declaring the Gulf of Mexico to be an area of Chinese national security interest. </p>
<p>To make clear that the claim to the South China Sea was not rhetorical, the Obama regime announced its “Pivot to Asia,” which calls for the redeployment of 60% of the US fleet to China’s zone of influence. Washington is busy at work securing naval and air bases from the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam, Australia, and Thailand. Washington has increased the provocation by aligning itself with China’s neighbors who are disputing China’s claims to various islands and an expanded air space.</p>
<p>China has not been intimidated. China has called for “de-americanizing the world.” Last month the Chinese government announced that it now possesses sufficient nuclear weapons and delivery systems to wipe the US off of the face of the earth. A couple of days ago, China aggressively harassed a US missile cruiser in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The militarily aggressive stance that Washington has taken toward Russia and China is indicative of the extreme self-assuredness that usually ends in war. Washington is told that US technological prowess can prevent or intercept the launch of Russian and Chinese missiles, thus elevating a US pre-emptive attack to slam-dunk status. Yet the potential danger from Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is said to be so great that a pre-emptive war is necessary right now, and a massive Department of Homeland Security is justified on the grounds that the US remains vulnerable to a few stateless Muslims who might acquire a nuclear weapon. It is an anomalous situation that the Russian and Chinese retaliatory response to US attack is considered to be inconsequential, but not nuclear threats from Iran and stateless Muslims.</p>
<p>Not content with sending war signals to Russia and China, Washington has apparently also decided to torpedo the Iranian settlement by announcing new sanctions against companies doing business with Iran. The Iranians understood Washington’s monkey wrench as Washington probably intended, as a lack of Washington’s commitment to the agreement, left Geneva and returned to Iran. It remains to be seen whether the agreement can be resurrected or whether the Israel Lobby has succeeded in derailing the agreement that promised to end the threat of war with Iran.</p>
<p>American citizens seem to have little, if any, influence on their government or even awareness of its intentions. Moreover, there is no organized opposition behind which Americans could rally to stop Washington’s drive toward world war. Hope, if there is any, would seem to lie with Washington’s European and Asian puppets. What interests do these governments have in putting the existence of their countries at risk for no other purpose than to help Washington acquire hegemony over the world? Cannot they realize that Washington’s game is a death-dealing one for them?</p>
<p>Germany alone could save the world from war while simultaneously serving its own interests. All Germany has to do is to exit the EU and NATO. The alliance would collapse, and its fall would terminate Washington’s hegemonic ambition.</p>

</div>
<p>In March of 1836, a young man of twenty-three years of age took his sword out of its scabbard and drew a line in the sand in front of an old mission outside of San Antonio, Texas, and called on the men defending that mission who were willing to stay on the ramparts and face an opposing army more than ten times their number to signify their commitment by stepping across the line. Of course, the young man was William Barrett Travis and the old mission was the Alamo. He could not have known it then, but Travis’ line in the sand would forever become the benchmark by which all future acts of commitment would be measured. In a mystical way, but, then again, in very real way, Travis’ line in the sand is being drawn again. Oh, it may not be a line in dirt drawn by the point of a sword; it is a line in the hearts of men being drawn by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>My last three columns (not including the column promoting THE FREEDOM DOCUMENTS) generated more responses than any three columns I have ever written, and I have been writing this column for some fifteen years. At first, the responses were mostly negative and often vitriolic. But this past week, responses have been over 90% positive and very enthusiastic. I am confident that the manner in which these columns have brought out intense emotion and determination on both sides is a microcosm of what is happening nationally. A line in the sand for freedom is being drawn once again.</p>
<p>This line in the sand for freedom is separating people in a major way. And this is not necessarily a bad thing. In the same way that God commanded Abram to separate from his home and kin, so, too, the Spirit of God is separating people many times from their friends, their neighbors, their kinfolk, and, yes, their church families. I seem to recall that during the period of the early church, the conflict of principle forever separated the apostles Paul and Silas. And during America’s War for Independence, the conflict of principle separated Benjamin Franklin and his son William&#8211;as it did tens of thousands of others.</p>
<p>Perhaps not since the days of Patrick Henry, Sam Adams, et al., have Americans been forced to deal&#8211;intellectually, reasonably, emotionally, volitionally, and spiritually&#8211;with the fundamental issues of liberty as we are being forced to do today. For way too long, Americans have taken freedom for granted. For way too long, our educational and religious institutions (not to mention our homes) have not taught the fundamental principles of liberty. This negligence has brought our country to the brink of oppression and despotism. And, just as was the case in Colonial America, a line in the sand for freedom is being drawn in the hearts of men.</p>
<p>This internal line in the sand is being drawn irrespective of a person’s education, temperament, upbringing, intelligence, or faith. While some men seem to be content to live under the heel of governmental oppression, many others have an innate thirst for freedom that all of the armies in the world cannot quench.</p>
<p>In truth, the thirst for freedom is part of Natural Law. A horse is not broken without a fight; a tiger or lion will pace its cage as long as it can walk looking for an avenue of escape; a bird will fly around its cage ten thousand times looking for an opening to return to the sky. Yes, animals can be broken&#8211;and so can be some men, unfortunately. But the innate desire for freedom is born in the soul of every man.</p>
<p>However, the desire for comfort, ease, and material pleasure is a handsome tempter that many people find more attractive than the harsh and weather-torn face of liberty. Plus, the further liberty slips out of view, the more vague the memory of it becomes. And before we realize it, the face of liberty is only seen in the irrelevant relics of the songs and statues of history. But it is exactly at this point that the Spirit of God begins to renew in the hearts of men the Natural thirst for liberty. And that is precisely what is happening now.</p>
<p>All over America, and, yes, all over the world, people’s hearts are beating fast for freedom. I am receiving thousands of letters and emails from people all over the globe. Unfortunately for many of these people, they do not live in a country in which the governmental and political foundation and structure is conducive to the reclamation of liberty. But in the United States, it is not a matter of government; it is a matter of will. Do the American people yet have the will to reclaim liberty?</p>
<p>While it would appear that the majority of today’s Americans have allowed ignorance, materialism, and false Bible teaching regarding the principles of liberty to suppress their love of liberty, I am absolutely convinced that the spirit of liberty is swelling in the hearts of teeming millions of people. Highly educated and high school dropouts, affluent and average, Christians and unchurched, men and women, young and old: their hearts are ablaze with the love of liberty. And they are no longer content to surround themselves with those who would allow the chains of servitude to be clamped around their necks.</p>
<p>Are we patriots or loyalists? That question had to be answered by every man and woman in Colonial America. The same question must be answered by every American today. Are we going to bravely fight for the principles of liberty as did our patriot forebears, or are we going to be loyal to a corrupt and tyrannical system that is literally choking the life out of our freedoms? And how each of us answers that question will determine the direction and destination of our lives and futures.</p>
<p>The freedom to separate is a Natural right. Forced union is not a union at all; it is enslavement. The current world and U.S. maps are testimonies to the right of Natural separation. Pat Buchanan recently wrote:</p>
<p>“In the last decade of the 20th century, as the Soviet Empire disintegrated, so, too, did that prison house of nations, the USSR.</p>
<p>“Out of the decomposing carcass came Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Moldova, all in Europe; Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus; and Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia.</p>
<p>“Transnistria then broke free of Moldova, and Abkhazia and South Ossetia fought free of Georgia.</p>
<p>“Yugoslavia dissolved far more violently into the nations of Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Kosovo.</p>
<p>“The Slovaks seceded from Czechoslovakia.”</p>
<p>Buchanan also notes that in the U.S., “Four of our 50 states&#8211;Maine, Vermont, Kentucky, West Virginia&#8211;were born out of other states.”</p>
<p>See Pat’s column at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnd.com%2F2013%2F10%2Fis-red-state-america-seceding%2F%23AiaabIMwzZPjVbIp.99&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEs1mWJI91tXEz8Sd8N1hT7_2yR-g" target="_blank">Is Red State America Seceding?</a></p>
<p>Think of this, too: the most fundamental and sacred union of all is the union of a man and woman in marriage. Had Adam and Eve not fallen into sin, there would, no doubt, be no right or reason for separation. (Matthew 19:8) But with the fall of man into sin came all kinds of abuse. As a result, the Scriptures grant divorce (separation) on the grounds of both adultery (Matthew 19) and abandonment (I Corinthians 7). While never preferred, few among us would deny the right of a husband or wife to separate under certain circumstances. Because not every man is willing to be governed by the Natural and revealed laws of God, men are granted the right to separate themselves from those who would violate the fundamental principles upon which the union is based. This is true maritally, ecclesiastically, spiritually, socially, and politically.</p>
<p>In 1836, Will Travis drew a line in the sand to separate those who were willing to defend the liberty of Texas on the ramparts of the Alamo from those who were not. And I am convinced that God is drawing a line in the hearts of men today for the same reason: to separate those who are willing to give their lives in the defense of liberty from those who are not. And, ironically, the freedom of everyone&#8211;including the ones who are not willing to defend it&#8211;depends on the willingness of the ones who are. I guess it’s always been that way.</p>
<p>I know which side of the line I am on; and after the deluge of correspondence I have received over the past couple of weeks, I know I am not alone.</p>

<p>There’s nothing like a glass of cool, clear water to quench one’s thirst. But the next time you or your child reaches for one, you might want to question whether that water is in fact, too toxic to drink. If your water is fluoridated, the answer may well be yes.</p>
<p>For decades, we have been told a lie, a lie that has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans and the weakening of the immune systems of tens of millions more. This lie is called fluoridation. A process we were led to believe was a safe and effective method of protecting teeth from decay is in fact a fraud. For decades it’s been shown that fluoridation is neither essential for good health nor protective of teeth. What it does is poison the body. We should all at this point be asking how and why public health policy and the American media continue to live with and perpetuate this scientific sham.</p>
<p><strong>The Latest in Fluoride News</strong></p>
<p>Today more than ever, evidence of fluoride’s toxicity is entering the public sphere.The summer of 2012 saw the publication of a systematic review and meta-analysis by researchers at Harvard University that explored the link between exposure to fluoride and neurological and cognitive function among children. The report pooled data from over 27 studies- many of them from China- carried out over the course of 22 years. The results, which were published in the journal Environmental Health Sciencesshowed a strong connection between exposure to fluoride in drinking water and decreased IQ scores in children. The team concluded that “the results suggest that fluoride may be a developmental neurotoxicant that affects brain development at exposures much below those that can cause toxicity in adults.&#8221; <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The newest scientific data suggest that the damaging effects of fluoride extend to reproductive health as well. A 2013 study published in the journal Archives of Toxicology showed a link between fluoride exposure and male infertility in mice. The study’s findings suggest that sodium fluoride impairs the ability of sperm cells in mice to normally fertilize the egg through a process known as chemotaxis.<sup> </sup><sup>2</sup> This is the latest in more than 60 scientific studies on animals that have identified an association between male infertility and fluoride exposure.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Adding more fuel to the fluoride controversy is a recent investigative report by NaturalNews exposing how the chemicals used to fluoridate United States’ water systems today are commonly purchased from Chinese chemical plants looking to discard surplus stores of this form of industrial waste. Disturbingly, the report details that some Chinese vendors of fluoride advertise on their website that their product can be used as an “adhesive preservative”, an “insecticide” as well as a” flux for soldering and welding”.<sup>4</sup><sup> </sup>One Chinese manufacturer, Shanghai Polymet Commodities Ltd,. which produces fluoride destined for municipal water reserves in the United States, notes on their website that their fluoride is “highly corrosive to human skin and harmful to people&#8217;s respiratory organs”.<sup> </sup><sup>5</sup></p>
<p><strong>The Fluoride Phase Out at Home and Abroad</strong></p>
<p>There are many signs in recent years that indicate growing skepticism over fluoridation. The New York Times reported in October 2011 that in the previous four years, about 200 jurisdictions across the USA moved to cease water fluoridation. A panel composed of scientists and health professionals in Fairbanks, Alaska recently recommended ceasing fluoridation of the county water supply after concluding that the addition of fluoride to already naturally-fluoridated reserves could pose health risks to 700,000 residents. The move to end fluoridation would save the county an estimated $205,000 annually.<sup> </sup><sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The city of Portland made headlines in 2013 when it voted down a measure to fluoridate its water supply. The citizens of Portland have rejected introducing the chemical to drinking water on three separate occasions since the 1950’s. Portland remains the largest city in the United States to shun fluoridation.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>The movement against fluoridation has gained traction overseas as well. In 2013, Israel’s Ministry of Health committed to a countrywide phase-out of fluoridation. The decision came after Israel’s Supreme Court deemed the existing health regulations requiring fluoridation to be based on science that is “outdated” and “no longer widely accepted.”<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Also this year, the government of the Australian state of Queensland eliminated $14 million in funding for its state-wide fluoridation campaign. The decision, which was executed by the Liberal National Party (LNP) government, forced local councils to vote on whether or not to introduce fluoride to their water supplies. Less than two months after the decision came down, several communities including the town of Cairns halted fluoridation. As a result, nearly 200,000 Australians will no longer be exposed to fluoride in their drinking water.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>An ever-growing number of institutions and individuals are questioning the wisdom of fluoridation. At the fore of the movement are thousands of scientific authorities and health care professionals who are speaking out about the hazards of this damaging additive. As of November 2013, a group of over 4549 professionals including 361 dentists and 562 medical doctors have added their names to a petition aimed at ending fluoridation started by the Fluoride Action Network.<sup> </sup> Among the prominent signatories are Nobel Laureate Arvid Carlsson and William Marcus, PhD who served as the chief toxicologist of the EPA Water Division.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The above sampling of recent news items on fluoride brings into sharp focus just how urgent it is to carry out a critical reassessment of the mass fluoridation campaign that currently affects hundreds of millions of Americans. In order to better understand the massive deception surrounding this toxic chemical, we must look back to the sordid history of how fluoride was first introduced.</p>
<p><strong>How to Market a Toxic Waste</strong></p>
<p>“We would not purposely add arsenic to the water supply. And we would not purposely add lead. But we do add fluoride. The fact is that fluoride is more toxic than lead and just slightly less toxic than arsenic.”<sup> </sup><sup>11</sup></p>
<p>These words of Dr. John Yiamouyiannis may come as a shock to you because, if you’re like most Americans, you have positive associations with fluoride. You may envision tooth protection, strong bones, and a <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/government/">government</a> that cares about your dental needs. What you’ve probably never been told is that the fluoride added to drinking water and toothpaste is a crude industrial waste product of the aluminum and fertilizer industries, and a substance toxic enough to be used as rat poison. How is it that Americans have learned to love an environmental hazard? This phenomenon can be attributed to a carefully planned marketing program begun even before Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first community to officially fluoridate its drinking water in 1945.<sup> </sup><sup>12</sup>   As a result of this ongoing campaign, nearly two-thirds of the nation has enthusiastically followed Grand Rapids’ example. But this push for fluoridation has less to do with a concern for America’s health than with industry’s penchant to expand at the expense of our nation’s well-being.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to understand about fluoride is that it’s the problem child of industry. Its toxicity was recognized at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when, in the 1850s iron and copper factories discharged it into the air and poisoned plants, animals, and people.<a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/fluoridekll.html#sdendnote13sym" name="sdendnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a>   The problem was exacerbated in the 1920s when rapid industrial growth meant massive pollution. Medical writer Joel Griffiths explains that “it was abundantly clear to both industry and <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/government/">government</a> that spectacular U.S. industrial expansion ­ and the economic and military power and vast profits it promised ­ would necessitate releasing millions of tons of waste fluoride into the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/environment/">environment</a>.”<sup>14</sup>  Their biggest fear was that “if serious injury to people were established, lawsuits alone could prove devastating to companies, while public outcry could force industry-wide government regulations, billions in pollution-control costs, and even mandatory changes in high-fluoride raw materials and profitable technologies.” <sup>15</sup></p>
<p>At first, industry could dispose of fluoride legally only in small amounts by selling it to insecticide and rat poison manufacturers.<sup> </sup><sup>16</sup>   Then a commercial outlet was devised in the 1930s when a connection was made between water supplies bearing traces of fluoride and lower rates of tooth decay. Griffiths writes that this was not a scientific breakthrough, but rather part of a “public disinformation campaign” by the aluminum industry “to convince the public that fluoride was safe and good.” Industry’s need prompted Alcoa-funded scientist Gerald J. Cox to announce that “The present trend toward complete removal of fluoride from water may need some reversal.” <sup>17</sup>   Griffiths writes:</p>
<p>“The big news in Cox’s announcement was that this ‘apparently worthless by-product’ had not only been proved safe (in low doses), but actually beneficial; it might reduce cavities in children. A proposal was in the air to add fluoride to the entire nation’s drinking water. While the dose to each individual would be low, ‘fluoridation’ on a national scale would require the annual addition of hundreds of thousands of tons of fluoride to the country’s drinking water.</p>
<p>“Government and industry ­ especially Alcoa ­ strongly supported intentional water fluoridation… [it] made possible a master public relations stroke ­ one that could keep scientists and the public off fluoride’s case for years to come. If the leaders of dentistry, medicine, and public health could be persuaded to endorse fluoride in the public’s drinking water, proclaiming to the nation that there was a ‘wide margin of safety,’ how were they going to turn around later and say industry’s fluoride pollution was dangerous?</p>
<p>“As for the public, if fluoride could be introduced as a health enhancing substance that should be added to the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/environment/">environment</a> for the children’s sake, those opposing it would look like quacks and lunatics….</p>
<p>“Back at the Mellon Institute, Alcoa’s Pittsburgh Industrial research lab, this news was galvanic. Alcoa-sponsored biochemist Gerald J. Cox immediately fluoridated some lab rats in a study and concluded that fluoride reduced cavities and that ‘The case should be regarded as proved.’ In a historic moment in 1939, the first public proposal that the U.S. should fluoridate its water supplies was made ­ not by a doctor, or dentist, but by Cox, an industry scientist working for a company threatened by fluoride damage claims.”<sup> </sup><sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Once the plan was put into action, industry was buoyant. They had finally found the channel for fluoride that they were looking for, and they were even cheered on by dentists, government agencies, and the public. Chemical Week, a publication for the chemical industry, described the tenor of the times: “All over the country, slide rules are getting warm as waterworks engineers figure the cost of adding fluoride to their water supplies.” They are riding a trend urged upon them, by the U.S. Public Health Service, the American Dental Association, the State Dental Health Directors, various state and local health bodies, and vocal women’s clubs from coast to coast. It adds up to a nice piece of business on all sides and many firms are cheering the PHS and similar groups as they plump for increasing adoption of fluoridation.”<sup> </sup><sup>19</sup></p>
<p>Such overwhelming acceptance allowed government and industry to proceed hastily, albeit irresponsibly. The Grand Rapids experiment was supposed to take 15 years, during which time health benefits and hazards were to be studied. In 1946, however, just one year into the experiment, six more U.S. cities adopted the process. By 1947, 87 more communities were treated; popular demand was the official reason for this unscientific haste.</p>
<p>The general public and its leaders did support the cause, but only after a massive government public relations campaign spearheaded by Edward L. Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud. Bernays, a public relations pioneer who has been called “the original spin doctor,”<sup> </sup><sup>20</sup>  was a masterful PR strategist. As a result of his influence, Griffiths writes, “Almost overnight…the popular image of fluoride ­ which at the time was being widely sold as rat and bug poison ­ became that of a beneficial provider of gleaming smiles, absolutely safe, and good for children, bestowed by a benevolent paternal government. Its opponents were permanently engraved on the public mind as crackpots and right-wing loonies.” <sup>21</sup></p>
<p>Griffiths explains that while opposition to fluoridation is usually associated with right-wingers, this picture is not totally accurate. He provides an interesting historical perspective on the anti-fluoridation stance:</p>
<p>“Fluoridation attracted opponents from every point on the continuum of politics and sanity. The prospect of the government mass-medicating the water supplies with a well-known rat poison to prevent a nonlethal disease flipped the switches of delusionals across the country ­ as well as generating concern among responsible scientists, doctors, and citizens.</p>
<p>“Moreover, by a fortuitous twist of circumstances, fluoride’s natural opponents on the left were alienated from the rest of the opposition. Oscar Ewing, a Federal Security Agency administrator, was a Truman “fair dealer” who pushed many progressive programs such as nationalized medicine. Fluoridation was lumped with his proposals. Inevitably, it was attacked by conservatives as a manifestation of “creeping socialism,” while the left rallied to its support. Later during the McCarthy era, the left was further alienated from the opposition when extreme right-wing groups, including the John Birch Society and the Ku Klux Klan, raved that fluoridation was a plot by the Soviet Union and/or communists in the government to poison America’s brain cells.</p>
<p>“It was a simple task for promoters, under the guidance of the ‘original spin doctor,’ to paint all opponents as deranged ­ and they played this angle to the hilt….</p>
<p>“Actually, many of the strongest opponents originally started out as proponents, but changed their minds after a close look at the evidence. And many opponents came to view fluoridation not as a communist plot, but simply as a capitalist-style con job of epic proportions. Some could be termed early environmentalists, such as the physicians George L. Waldbott and Frederick B. Exner, who first documented government-industry complicity in hiding the hazards of fluoride pollution from the public. Waldbott and Exner risked their careers in a clash with fluoride defenders, only to see their cause buried in toothpaste ads.”<sup> </sup><sup>22</sup></p>
<p>By 1950, fluoridation’s image was a sterling one, and there was not much <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/science/">science</a> could do at this point. The Public Health Service was fluoridation’s main source of funding as well as its promoter, and therefore caught in a fundamental conflict of interest.<sup> </sup><sup>12</sup>   If fluoridation were found to be unsafe and ineffective, and laws were repealed, the organization feared a loss of face, since scientists, politicians, dental groups, and physicians unanimously supported it. <sup>23</sup>  For this reason, studies concerning its effects were not undertaken. The Oakland Tribune noted this when it stated that “public health officials have often suppressed scientific doubts” about fluoridation.<sup>24</sup><sup> </sup>Waldbott sums up the situation when he says that from the beginning, the controversy over fluoridating water supplies was “a political, not a scientific health issue.”<sup>25</sup></p>
<p>The marketing of fluoride continues. In a 1983 letter from the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/environmental-protection-agency/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, then Deputy Assistant Administrator for Water, Rebecca Hammer, writes that the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/epa/">EPA</a> “regards [fluoridation] as an ideal environmental solution to a long-standing problem. By recovering by-product fluosilicic acid from fertilizer manufacturing, water and air pollution are minimized and water utilities have a low-cost source of fluoride available to them.”<sup> </sup><sup>26</sup>    A 1992 policy statement from the Department of Health and Human Services says, “A recent comprehensive PHS review of the benefits and potential health risks of fluoride has concluded that the practice of fluoridating community water supplies is safe and effective.” <sup>27</sup></p>
<p>According to the CDC website, about 200 million Americans in 16,500 communities are exposed to fluoridated water. Out of the 50 largest cities in the US, 43 have fluoridated water.<sup> </sup><sup>28</sup></p>
<p>To help celebrate fluoride’s widespread use, the media recently reported on the 50th anniversary of fluoridation in Grand Rapids. Newspaper articles titled “Fluoridation: a shining public health success”<sup> </sup><sup>29</sup>  and “After 50 years, fluoride still works with a smile”  <sup>30</sup>  painted glowing pictures of the practice. Had investigators looked more closely, though, they might have learned that children in Muskegon, Michigan, an unfluoridated “control” city, had equal drops in dental decay. They might also have learned of the other studies that dispute the supposed wonders of fluoride.</p>
<p><strong>The Fluoride Myth Doesn’t Hold Water</strong></p>
<p>The big hope for fluoride was its ability to immunize children’s developing teeth against cavities. Rates of dental caries were supposed to plummet in areas where water was treated. Yet decades of experience and worldwide research have contradicted this expectation numerous times. Here are just a few examples:</p>
<p>In British Columbia, only 11% of the population drinks fluoridated water, as opposed to 40-70% in other Canadian regions. Yet British Columbia has the lowest rate of tooth decay in Canada. In addition, the lowest rates of dental caries within the province are found in areas that do not have their water supplies fluoridated.<sup> </sup><sup>31</sup></p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/sierra-club/">Sierra Club</a> study, people in unfluoridated developing nations have fewer dental caries than those living in industrialized nations. As a result, they conclude that “fluoride is not essential to dental health.”<sup> </sup><sup>32</sup></p>
<p>In 1986-87, the largest study on fluoridation and tooth decay ever was performed. The subjects were 39,000 school children between 5 and 17 living in 84 areas around the country. A third of the places were fluoridated, a third were partially fluoridated, and a third were not. Results indicate no statistically significant differences in dental decay between fluoridated and unfluoridated cities.<sup> </sup><sup>33</sup></p>
<p>A World Health Organization survey reports a decline of dental decay in western Europe, which is 98% unfluoridated. They state that western Europe’s declining dental decay rates are equal to and sometimes better than those in the U.S.<sup> </sup><sup>34</sup></p>
<p>A 1992 University of Arizona study yielded surprising results when they found that “the more fluoride a child drinks, the more cavities appear in the teeth.”<sup> </sup><sup>35</sup></p>
<p>Although all Native American reservations are fluoridated, children living there have much higher incidences of dental decay and other oral health problems than do children living in other U.S. communities.<sup> </sup><sup>36</sup></p>
<p>In light of all the evidence, fluoride proponents now make more modest claims. For example, in 1988, the ADA professed that a 40- to 60% cavity reduction could be achieved with the help of fluoride. Now they claim an 18- to 25% reduction. Other promoters mention a 12% decline in tooth decay.</p>
<p>And some former supporters are even beginning to question the need for fluoridation altogether. In 1990, a National Institute for Dental Research report stated that “it is likely that if caries in children remain at low levels or decline further, the necessity of continuing the current variety and extent of fluoride-based prevention programs will be questioned.”<sup> </sup><sup>37</sup></p>
<p>Most government agencies, however, continue to ignore the scientific evidence and to market fluoridation by making fictional claims about its benefits and pushing for its expansion. For instance, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, “National surveys of oral health dating back several decades document continuing decreases in tooth decay in children, adults and senior citizens. Nevertheless, there are parts of the country and particular populations that remain without protection. For these reasons, the U.S. PHS…has set a national goal for the year 2000 that 75% of persons served by community water systems will have access to optimally fluoridated drinking water; currently this figure is just about 60%. The year 2000 target goal is both desirable and yet challenging, based on past progress and continuing evidence of effectiveness and safety of this public health measure.”<sup> </sup><sup>38</sup></p>
<p>This statement is flawed on several accounts. First, as we’ve seen, research does not support the effectiveness of fluoridation for preventing tooth disease. Second, purported benefits are supposedly for children, not adults and senior citizens. At about age 13, any advantage fluoridation might offer comes to an end, and less than 1% of the fluoridated water supply reaches this population.<sup> </sup> And third, fluoridation has never been proven safe. On the contrary, several studies directly link fluoridation to skeletal fluorosis, dental fluorosis, and several rare forms of cancer. This alone should frighten us away from its use.</p>
<p><strong>Biological Safety Concerns</strong></p>
<p>Only a small margin separates supposedly beneficial fluoride levels from amounts that are known to cause adverse effects. Dr. James Patrick, a former antibiotics research scientist at the National Institutes of Health, describes the predicament:</p>
<p>“[There is] a very low margin of safety involved in fluoridating water. A concentration of about 1 ppm is recommended…in several countries, severe fluorosis has been documented from water supplies containing only 2 or 3 ppm. In the development of drugs…we generally insist on a therapeutic index (margin of safety) of the order of 100; a therapeutic index of 2 or 3 is totally unacceptable, yet that is what has been proposed for public water supplies.”<sup>39</sup><sup> </sup></p>
<p>Other countries argue that even 1 ppm is not a safe concentration. Canadian studies, for example, imply that children under three should have no fluoride whatsoever. The Journal of the Canadian Dental Association states that “Fluoride supplements should not be recommended for children less than 3 years old.”<sup> </sup><sup>40</sup>   Since these supplements contain the same amount of fluoride as water does, they are basically saying that children under the age of three shouldn’t be drinking fluoridated water at all, under any circumstances. Japan has reduced the amount of fluoride in their drinking water to one-eighth of what is recommended in the U.S. Instead of 1 milligram per liter, they use less than 15 hundredths of a milligram per liter as the upper limit allowed. <sup>41</sup></p>
<p>Even supposing that low concentrations are safe, there is no way to control how much fluoride different people consume, as some take in a lot more than others. For example, laborers, athletes, diabetics, and those living in hot or dry regions can all be expected to drink more water, and therefore more fluoride (in fluoridated areas) than others.<sup> </sup><sup>42</sup>   Due to such wide variations in water consumption, it is impossible to scientifically control what dosage of fluoride a person receives via the water supply.<sup>43</sup></p>
<p>Another concern is that fluoride is not found only in drinking water; it is everywhere. Fluoride is found in foods that are processed with it, which, in the United States, include nearly all bottled drinks and canned foods.<sup> </sup><sup>44</sup>  Researchers writing in The Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry have found that fruit juices, in particular, contain significant amounts of fluoride. In one study, a variety of popular juices and juice blends were analyzed and it was discovered that 42% of the samples examined had more than l ppm of fluoride, with some brands of grape juice containing much higher levels ­ up to 6.8 ppm! The authors cite the common practice of using fluoride-containing insecticide in growing grapes as a factor in these high levels, and they suggest that the fluoride content of beverages be printed on their labels, as is other nutritional information. <sup>45</sup>  Considering how much juice some children ingest, and the fact that youngsters often insist on particular brands that they consume day after day, labeling seems like a prudent idea. But beyond this is the larger issue that this study brings up: Is it wise to subject children and others who are heavy juice drinkers to additional fluoride in their water?</p>
<p>Here’s a little-publicized reality: Cooking can greatly increase a food’s fluoride content. Peas, for example, contain 12 micrograms of fluoride when raw and 1500 micrograms after they are cooked in fluoridated water, which is a tremendous difference. Also, we should keep in mind that fluoride is an ingredient in pharmaceuticals, aerosols, insecticides, and pesticides.</p>
<p>And of course, toothpastes. It’s interesting to note that in the 1950s, fluoridated toothpastes were required to carry warnings on their labels saying that they were not to be used in areas where water was already fluoridated. Crest toothpaste went so far as to write: “Caution: Children under 6 should not use Crest.” These regulations were dropped in 1958, although no new research was available to prove that the overdose hazard no longer existed.<sup> </sup><sup>46</sup></p>
<p>Today, common fluoride levels in toothpaste are 1000 ppm. Research chemist Woodfun Ligon notes that swallowing a small amount adds substantially to fluoride intake.<sup> </sup><sup>47</sup> Dentists say that children commonly ingest up to 0.5 mg of fluoride a day from toothpaste. <sup>48</sup></p>
<p>This inevitably raises another issue: How safe is all this fluoride? According to scientists and informed doctors, such as Dr. John Lee, it is not safe at all. Dr. Lee first took an anti-fluoridation stance back in 1972, when as chairman of an environmental health committee for a local medical society, he was asked to state their position on the subject. He stated that after investigating the references given by both pro- and anti-fluoridationists, the group discovered three important things:</p>
<p>“One, the claims of benefit of fluoride, the 60% reduction of cavities, was not established by any of these studies. Two, we found that the investigations into the toxic side effects of fluoride have not been done in any way that was acceptable. And three, we discovered that the estimate of the amount of fluoride in the food chain, in the total daily fluoride intake, had been measured in 1943, and not since then. By adding the amount of fluoride that we now have in the food chain, which comes from food processing with fluoridated water, plus all the fluoridated toothpaste that was not present in 1943, we found that the daily intake of fluoride was far in excess of what was considered optimal.”<sup> </sup><sup>49</sup></p>
<p>What happens when fluoride intake exceeds the optimal? The inescapable fact is that this substance has been associated with severe health problems, ranging from skeletal and dental fluorosis to bone fractures, to fluoride poisoning, and even to cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Skeletal Fluorosis</strong></p>
<p>When fluoride is ingested, approximately 93% of it is absorbed into the bloodstream. A good part of the material is excreted, but the rest is deposited in the bones and teeth, and is capable of causing a crippling skeletal fluorosis. This is a condition that can damage the musculoskeletal and nervous systems and result in muscle wasting, limited joint motion, spine deformities, and calcification of the ligaments, as well as neurological deficits.</p>
<p>Large numbers of people in Japan, China, India, the Middle East, and Africa have been diagnosed with skeletal fluorosis from drinking naturally fluoridated water. In India alone, nearly a million people suffer from the affliction.<sup> </sup><sup>39</sup>   While only a dozen cases of skeletal fluorosis have been reported in the United States, Chemical and Engineering News states that “critics of the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/epa/">EPA</a> standard speculate that there probably have been many more cases of fluorosis ­ even crippling fluorosis ­ than the few reported in the literature because most doctors in the U.S. have not studied the disease and do not know how to diagnose it.” <sup>50</sup></p>
<p>Radiologic changes in bone occur when fluoride exposure is 5 mg/day, according to the late Dr. George Waldbott, author of Fluoridation: The Great Dilemma. While this 5 mg/day level is the amount of fluoride ingested by most people living in fluoridated areas,<sup> </sup><sup>51</sup>   the number increases for diabetics and laborers, who can ingest up to 20 mg of fluoride daily. In addition, a survey conducted by the Department of Agriculture shows that 3% of the U.S. population drinks 4 liters or more of water every day. If these individuals live in areas where the water contains a fluoride level of 4 ppm, allowed by the EPA, they are ingesting 16 mg/day from the consumption of water alone, and are thus at greater risk for getting skeletal fluorosis. <sup>52</sup></p>
<p><strong>Dental Fluorosis</strong></p>
<p>According to a 1989 National Institute for Dental Research study, 1-2% of children living in areas fluoridated at 1 ppm develop dental fluorosis, that is, permanently stained, brown mottled teeth. Up to 23% of children living in areas naturally fluoridated at 4 ppm develop severe dental fluorosis.<sup> </sup><sup>53</sup>  Other research gives higher figures. The publication Health Effects of Ingested Fluoride, put out by the National Academy of Sciences, reports that in areas with optimally fluoridated water (1 ppm, either natural or added), dental fluorosis levels in recent years ranged from 8 to 51%. Recently, a prevalence of slightly over 80% was reported in children 12-14 years old in Augusta, Georgia.</p>
<p>Fluoride is a noteworthy chemical additive in that its officially acknowledged benefit and damage levels are about the same. Writing in The Progressive, <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/science/">science</a> journalist Daniel Grossman elucidates this point: “Though many beneficial <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/chemicals/">chemicals</a> are dangerous when consumed at excessive levels, fluoride is unique because the amount that dentists recommend to prevent cavities is about the same as the amount that causes dental fluorosis.”<sup> </sup><sup>54</sup>   Although the American Dental Association and the government consider dental fluorosis only a cosmetic problem, the American Journal of Public Health says that “…brittleness of moderately and severely mottled teeth may be associated with elevated caries levels.” <sup>45</sup>   In other words, in these cases the fluoride is causing the exact problem that it’s supposed to prevent. Yiamouyiannis adds, “In highly naturally-fluoridated areas, the teeth actually crumble as a result. These are the first visible symptoms of fluoride poisoning.” <sup>55</sup></p>
<p>Also, when considering dental fluorosis, there are factors beyond the physical that you can’t ignore ­ the negative psychological effects of having moderately to severely mottled teeth. These were recognized in a 1984 National Institute of Mental Health panel that looked into this problem.<sup> </sup></p>
<p>A telling trend is that TV commercials for toothpaste, and toothpaste tubes themselves, are now downplaying fluoride content as a virtue. This was noted in an article in the Sarasota/Florida ECO Report,<sup> </sup><sup>56</sup> whose author, George Glasser, feels that manufacturers are distancing themselves from the additive because of fears of lawsuits. The climate is ripe for these, and Glasser points out that such a class action suit has already been filed in England against the manufacturers of fluoride-containing products on behalf of children suffering from dental fluorosis.</p>
<p><strong>Bone Fractures</strong></p>
<p>At one time, fluoride therapy was recommended for building denser bones and preventing fractures associated with osteoporosis. Now several articles in peer-reviewed journals suggest that fluoride actually causes more harm than good, as it is associated with bone breakage. Three studies reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed links between hip fractures and fluoride.<sup> </sup><a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/fluoridekll.html#sdendnote57sym" name="sdendnote57anc"><sup>57</sup></a><a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/fluoridekll.html#sdendnote58sym" name="sdendnote58anc"><sup>58</sup></a><a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/fluoridekll.html#sdendnote59sym" name="sdendnote59anc"><sup>59</sup></a> Findings here were, for instance, that there is “a small but significant increase in the risk of hip fractures in both men and women exposed to artificial fluoridation at 1 ppm.”   In addition, the New England Journal of Medicine reports that people given fluoride to cure their osteoporosis actually wound up with an increased nonvertebral fracture rate. <sup>60</sup>  Austrian researchers have also found that fluoride tablets make bones more susceptible to fractures.<sup>61</sup> The U.S. National Research Council states that the U.S. hip fracture rate is now the highest in the world. <sup>62</sup></p>
<p>Louis V. Avioli, professor at the Washington University School of Medicine, says in a 1987 review of the subject: “Sodium fluoride therapy is accompanied by so many medical complications and side effects that it is hardly worth exploring in depth as a therapeutic mode for postmenopausal osteoporosis, since it fails to decrease the propensity for hip fractures and increases the incidence of stress fractures in the extremities.”<sup> </sup><sup>63</sup></p>
<p><strong>Fluoride Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>In May 1992, 260 people were poisoned, and one man died, in Hooper Bay, Alaska, after drinking water contaminated with 150 ppm of fluoride. The accident was attributed to poor equipment and an unqualified operator.<sup> </sup><sup>55</sup>   Was this a fluke? Not at all. Over the years, the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/cdc/">CDC</a> has recorded several incidents of excessive fluoride permeating the water supply and sickening or killing people. We don’t usually hear about these occurrences in news reports, but interested citizens have learned the truth from data obtained under the <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/freedom/">Freedom</a> of Information Act. Here is a partial list of toxic spills we have not been told about:</p>
<p>July 1993 ­ Chicago, Illinois: Three dialysis patients died and five experienced toxic reactions to the fluoridated water used in the treatment process. The CDC was asked to investigate, but to date there have been no press releases.</p>
<p>May 1993 ­ Kodiak, Alaska (Old Harbor): The population was warned not to consume water due to high fluoride levels. They were also cautioned against boiling the water, since this concentrates the substance and worsens the danger. Although equipment appeared to be functioning normally, 22-24 ppm of fluoride was found in a sample.</p>
<p>July 1992 ­ Marin County, California: A pump malfunction allowed too much fluoride into the Bon Tempe treatment plant. Two million gallons of fluoridated water were diverted to Phoenix Lake, elevating the lake surface by more than two inches and forcing some water over the spillway.</p>
<p>December 1991 ­ Benton Harbor, Michigan: A faulty pump allowed approximately 900 gallons of hydrofluosilicic acid to leak into a chemical storage building at the water plant. City engineer Roland Klockow stated, “The concentrated hydrofluosilicic acid was so corrosive that it ate through more than two inches of concrete in the storage building.” This water did not reach water consumers, but fluoridation was stopped until June 1993. The original equipment was only two years old.</p>
<p>July 1991 ­ Porgate, Michigan: After a fluoride injector pump failed, fluoride levels reached 92 ppm and resulted in approximately 40 children developing abdominal pains, sickness, vomiting, and diarrhea at a school arts and crafts show.</p>
<p>November 1979 ­ Annapolis, Maryland: One patient died and eight became ill after renal dialysis treatment. Symptoms included cardiac arrest (resuscitated), hypotension, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a whole gamut of intestinal problems. Patients not on dialysis also reported nausea, headaches, cramps, diarrhea, and dizziness. The fluoride level was later found to be 35 ppm; the problem was traced to a valve at a water plant that had been left open all night.<sup> </sup><sup>64</sup></p>
<p>Instead of addressing fluoridation’s problematic safety record, officials have chosen to cover it up. For example, the ADA says in one booklet distributed to health agencies that “Fluoride feeders are designed to stop operating when a malfunction occurs… so prolonged over-fluoridation becomes a mechanical impossibility.”<sup> </sup> <sup> </sup> In addition, the information that does reach the population after an accident is woefully inaccurate. A spill in Annapolis, Maryland, placed thousands at risk, but official reports reduced the number to eight. <sup>65</sup>  Perhaps officials are afraid they will invite more lawsuits like the one for $480 million by the wife of a dialysis patient who became brain-injured as the result of fluoride poisoning.</p>
<p>Not all fluoride poisoning is accidental. For decades, industry has knowingly released massive quantities of fluoride into the air and water. Disenfranchised communities, with people least able to fight back, are often the victims. Medical writer Joel Griffiths relays this description of what industrial pollution can do, in this case to a devastatingly poisoned Indian reservation:</p>
<p>“Cows crawled around the pasture on their bellies, inching along like giant snails. So crippled by bone disease they could not stand up, this was the only way they could graze. Some died kneeling, after giving birth to stunted calves. Others kept on crawling until, no longer able to chew because their teeth had crumbled down to the nerves, they began to starve….” They were the cattle of the Mohawk Indians on the New York-Canadian St. Regis Reservation during the period 1960-1975, when industrial pollution devastated the herd ­ and along with it, the Mohawks’ way of life….Mohawk children, too, have shown signs of damage to bones and teeth.”<sup> </sup><sup>66</sup></p>
<p>Mohawks filed suit against the Reynolds Metals Company and the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) in 1960, but ended up settling out of court, where they received $650,000 for their cows.<sup> </sup><sup>67</sup></p>
<p>Fluoride is one of industry’s major pollutants, and no one remains immune to its effects. In 1989, 155,000 tons were being released annually into the air,<sup> </sup>   and 500,000 tons a year were disposed of in our lakes, rivers, and oceans. <sup>68</sup><sup><br />
</sup></p>
<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Numerous studies demonstrate links between fluoridation and cancer; however, agencies promoting fluoride consistently refute or cover up these findings.</p>
<p>In 1977, Dr. John Yiamouyiannis and Dr. Dean Burk, former chief chemist at the National Cancer Institute, released a study that linked fluoridation to 10,000 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. Their inquiry, which compared cancer deaths in the ten largest fluoridated American cities to those in the ten largest unfluoridated cities between 1940 and 1950, discovered a 5% greater rate in the fluoridated areas.<sup> </sup><sup>69</sup>  The NCI disputed these findings, since an earlier analysis of theirs apparently failed to pick up these extra deaths. Federal authorities claimed that Yiamouyiannis and Burk were in error, and that any increase was caused by statistical changes over the years in age, gender, and racial composition. <sup>70</sup></p>
<p>In order to settle the question of whether or not fluoride is a carcinogen, a Congressional subcommittee instructed the National Toxicology Program (NTP) to perform another investigation.<sup> </sup><sup>71</sup>  That study, due in 1980, was not released until 1990. However, in 1986, while the study was delayed, the EPA raised the standard fluoride level in drinking water from 2.4 to 4 ppm. <sup>72</sup>   After this step, some of the government’s own employees in NFFE Local 2050 took what the Oakland Tribune termed the “remarkable step of denouncing that action as political.” <sup>73</sup></p>
<p>When the NTP study results became known in early 1990, union president Dr. Robert Carton, who works in the EPA’s Toxic Substances Division, published a statement. It read, in part: “Four years ago, NFFE Local 2050, which represents all 1100 professionals at EPA headquarters, alerted then Administrator Lee Thomas to the fact that the scientific support documents for the fluoride in drinking water standard were fatally flawed. The fluoride juggernaut proceeded as it apparently had for the last 40 years ­ without any regard for the facts or concern for public health.</p>
<p>“EPA raised the allowed level of fluoride before the results of the rat/mouse study ordered by Congress in 1977 was complete. Today, we find out how irresponsible that decision was. The results reported by NTP, and explained today by Dr. Yiamouyiannis, are, as he notes, not surprising considering the vast amount of data that caused the animal study to be conducted in the first place. The results are not surprising to NFFE Local 2050 either. Four years ago we realized that the claim that there was no evidence that fluoride could cause genetic effects or cancer could not be supported by the shoddy document thrown together by the EPA contractor.</p>
<p>“It was apparent to us that EPA bowed to political pressure without having done an in-depth, independent analysis, using in-house experts, of the currently existing data that show fluoride causes genetic effects, promotes the growth of cancerous tissue, and is likely to cause cancer in humans. If EPA had done so, it would have been readily apparent ­ as it was to Congress in 1977 ­ that there were serious reasons to believe in a cancer threat.</p>
<p>“The behavior by EPA in this affair raises questions about the integrity of science at EPA and the role of professional scientists, lawyers and engineers who provide the interpretation of the available data and the judgements necessary to protect the public health and the environment. Are scientists at EPA there to arrange facts to fit preconceived conclusions? Does the Agency have a responsibility to develop world-class experts in the risks posed by <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/chemicals/">chemicals</a> we are exposed to every day, or is it permissible for EPA to cynically shop around for contractors who will provide them the ‘correct’ answers?”<sup> </sup><sup>74</sup><br />
What were the NTP study results? Out of 130 male rats that ingested 45 to 79 ppm of fluoride, 5 developed osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer. There were cases, in both males and females at those doses, of squamous cell carcinoma in the mouth. <sup>75</sup>  Both rats and mice had dose-related fluorosis of the teeth, and female rats suffered osteosclerosis of the long bones.<sup>76</sup></p>
<p>When Yiamouyiannis analyzed the same data, he found mice with a particularly rare form of liver cancer, known as hepatocholangiocarcinoma. This cancer is so rare, according to Yiamouyiannis, that the odds of its appearance in this study by chance are 1 in 2 million in male mice and l in 100,000 in female mice.<sup> </sup>   He also found precancerous changes in oral squamous cells, an increase in squamous cell tumors and cancers, and thyroid follicular cell tumors as a result of increasing levels of fluoride in drinking water. <sup>77</sup></p>
<p>A March 13, 1990, New York Times article commented on the NTP findings: “Previous animal tests suggesting that water fluoridation might pose risks to humans have been widely discounted as technically flawed, but the latest investigation carefully weeded out sources of experimental or statistical error, many scientists say, and cannot be discounted.”<sup> </sup><sup>78</sup>  In the same article, biologist Dr. Edward Groth notes: “The importance of this study…is that it is the first fluoride bioassay giving positive results in which the latest state-of-the-art procedures have been rigorously applied. It has to be taken seriously.” <sup>71</sup></p>
<p>On February 22, 1990, the Medical Tribune, an international medical news weekly received by 125,000 doctors, offered the opinion of a federal scientist who preferred to remain anonymous:</p>
<p>“It is difficult to see how EPA can fail to regulate fluoride as a carcinogen in light of what NTP has found. Osteosarcomas are an extremely unusual result in rat carcinogenicity tests. Toxicologists tell me that the only other substance that has produced this is radium….The fact that this is a highly atypical form of cancer implicates fluoride as the cause. Also, the osteosarcomas appeared to be dose-related, and did not occur in controls, making it a clean study.”<sup> </sup><sup>79</sup></p>
<p>Public health officials were quick to assure a concerned public that there was nothing to worry about! The ADA said the occurrence of cancers in the lab may not be relevant to humans since the level of fluoridation in the experimental animals’ water was so high.<sup> </sup><sup>80</sup>   But the Federal Register, which is the handbook of government practices, disagrees: “The high exposure of experimental animals to toxic agents is a necessary and valid method of discovering possible carcinogenic hazards in man. To disavow the findings of this test would be to disavow those of all such tests, since they are all conducted according to this standard.” <sup>73</sup> <sup> </sup> As a February 5, 1990, Newsweek article pointed out, “such megadosing is standard toxicological practice. It’s the only way to detect an effect without using an impossibly large number of test animals to stand in for the humans exposed to the substance.” <sup>81</sup> And as the Safer Water Foundation explains, higher doses are generally administered to test animals to compensate for the animals’ shorter life span and because humans are generally more vulnerable than test animals on a body-weight basis. <sup>82</sup></p>
<p>Several other studies link fluoride to genetic damage and cancer. An article in Mutation Research says that a study by Proctor and Gamble, the very company that makes Crest toothpaste, did research showing that 1 ppm fluoride causes genetic damage.<sup>83</sup><sup> </sup>Results were never published but Proctor and Gamble called them “clean,” meaning animals were supposedly free of malignant tumors. Not so, according to scientists who believe some of the changes observed in test animals could be interpreted as precancerous. <sup>84</sup>   Yiamouyiannis says the Public Health Service sat on the data, which were finally released via a <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/freedom/">Freedom</a> of Information Act request in 1989. “Since they are biased, they have tried to cover up harmful effects,” he says. “But the data speaks for itself. Half the amount of fluoride that is found in the New York City drinking water causes genetic damage.” <sup>46</sup></p>
<p>A National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences publication, Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis, also linked fluoride to genetic toxicity when it stated that “in cultured human and rodent cells, the weight of evidence leads to the conclusion that fluoride exposure results in increased chromosome aberrations.”<sup> </sup><sup>85</sup> The result of this is not only birth defects but the mutation of normal cells into cancer cells. The Journal of Carcinogenesis further states that “fluoride not only has the ability to transform normal cells into cancer cells but also to enhance the cancer-causing properties of other chemicals.” <sup>86</sup></p>
<p>Surprisingly, the PHS put out a report called Review of fluoride: benefits and risks, in which they showed a substantially higher incidence of bone cancer in young men exposed to fluoridated water compared to those who were not. The New Jersey Department of Health also found that the risk of bone cancer was about three times as high in fluoridated areas as in nonfluoridated areas.<sup> </sup><sup>87</sup></p>
<p>Despite cover-up attempts, the light of knowledge is filtering through to some enlightened scientists. Regarding animal test results, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, James Huff, does say that “the reason these animals got a few osteosarcomas was because they were given fluoride…Bone is the target organ for fluoride.”  Toxicologist William Marcus adds that “fluoride is a carcinogen by any standard we use. I believe EPA should act immediately to protect the public, not just on the cancer data, but on the evidence of bone fractures, arthritis, mutagenicity, and other effects.” <sup>88</sup></p>
<p><strong>The Challenge of Eliminating Fluoride</strong></p>
<p>Given all the scientific challenges to the idea of the safety of fluoride, why does it remain a protected contaminant? As Susan Pare of the Center for Health Action asks, “…even if fluoride in the water did reduce tooth decay, which it does not, how can the EPA allow a substance more toxic than Alar, red dye #3, and vinyl chloride to be injected purposely into drinking water?”<sup> </sup><sup>89</sup></p>
<p>This is certainly a logical question and, with all the good science that seems to exist on the subject, you would think that there would be a great deal of interest in getting fluoride out of our water supply. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case. As Dr. William Marcus, a senior science advisor in the EPA’s Office of Drinking Water, has found, the top governmental priority has been to sweep the facts under the rug and, if need be, to suppress truth-tellers. Marcus explains<sup> </sup><sup>90</sup>  that fluoride is one of the chemicals the EPA specifically regulates, and that he was following the data coming in on fluoride very carefully when a determination was going to be made on whether the levels should be changed. He discovered that the data were not being heeded. But that was only the beginning of the story for him. Marcus recounts what happened:</p>
<p>“The studies that were done by Botel Northwest showed that there was an increased level of bone cancer and other types of cancer in animals….in that same study, there were very rare liver cancers, according to the board-certified veterinary pathologists at the contractor, Botel. Those really were very upsetting because they were hepatocholangeal carcinomas, very rare liver cancers….Then there were several other kinds of cancers that were found in the jaw and other places.</p>
<p>“I felt at that time that the reports were alarming. They showed that the levels of fluoride that can cause cancers in animals are actually lower than those levels ingested in people (who take lower amounts but for longer periods of time).</p>
<p>“I went to a meeting that was held in Research Triangle Park, in April 1990, in which the National Toxicology Program was presenting their review of the study. I went with several colleagues of mine, one of whom was a board-certified veterinary pathologist who originally reported hepatocholangeal carcinoma as a separate entity in rats and mice. I asked him if he would look at the slides to see if that really was a tumor or if the pathologists at Botel had made an error. He told me after looking at the slides that, in fact, it was correct.</p>
<p>“At the meeting, every one of the cancers reported by the contractor had been downgraded by the National Toxicology Program. I have been in the toxicology business looking at studies of this nature for nearly 25 years and I have never before seen every single cancer endpoint downgraded…. I found that very suspicious and went to see an investigator in the Congress at the suggestion of my friend, Bob Carton. This gentleman and his staff investigated very thoroughly and found out that the scientists at the National Toxicology Program down at Research Triangle Park had been coerced by their superiors to change their findings.”<sup>91</sup></p>
<p>Once Dr. Marcus acted on his findings, something ominous started to happen in his life: “…I wrote an internal memorandum and gave it to my supervisors. I waited for a month without hearing anything. Usually, you get a feedback in a week or so. I wrote another memorandum to a person who was my second-line supervisor explaining that if there was even a slight chance of increased cancer in the general population, since 140 million people were potentially ingesting this material, that the deaths could be in the many thousands. Then I gave a copy of the memorandum to the Fluoride Work Group, who waited some time and then released it to the press.</p>
<p>“Once it got into the press all sorts of things started happening at EPA. I was getting disciplinary threats, being isolated, and all kinds of things which ultimately resulted in them firing me on March 15, 1992.”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>In order to be reinstated at work, Dr. Marcus took his case to court. In the process, he learned that the government had engaged in various illegal activities, including 70 felony counts, in order to get him fired. At the same time, those who committed perjury were not held accountable for it. In fact, they were rewarded for their efforts:</p>
<p>“When we finally got the EPA to the courtroom…they admitted to doing several things to get me fired. We had notes of a meeting…that showed that fluoride was one of the main topics discussed and that it was agreed that they would fire me with the help of the Inspector General. When we got them on the stand and showed them the memoranda, they finally remembered and said, oh yes, we lied about that in our previous statements.</p>
<p>“Then…they admitted to shredding more than 70 documents that they had in hand ­ Freedom of Information requests. That’s a felony…. In addition, they charged me with stealing time from the government. They…tried to show…that I had been doing private work on government time and getting paid for it. When we came to court, I was able to show that the time cards they produced were forged, and forged by the Inspector General’s staff….”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>For all his efforts, Dr. Marcus was rehired, but nothing else has changed: “The EPA was ordered to rehire me, which they did. They were given a whole series of requirements to be met, such as paying me my back pay, restoring my leave, privileges, and sick leave and annual leave. The only thing they’ve done is put me back to work. They haven’t given me any of those things that they were required to do.”<sup>92</sup></p>
<p>What is at the core of such ruthless tactics? John Yiamouyiannis feels that the central concern of government is to protect industry, and that the motivating force behind fluoride use is the need of certain businesses to dump their toxic waste products somewhere. They try to be inconspicuous in the disposal process and not make waves. “As is normal, the solution to pollution is dilution. You poison everyone a little bit rather than poison a few people a lot. This way, people don’t know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>Since the Public Health Service has promoted the fluoride myth for over 50 years, they’re concerned about protecting their reputation. So scientists like Dr. Marcus, who know about the dangers, are intimidated into keeping silent. Otherwise, they jeopardize their careers. Dr. John Lee elaborates: “Back in 1943, the PHS staked their professional careers on the benefits and safety of fluoride. It has since become bureaucratized. Any public health official who criticizes fluoride, or even hints that perhaps it was an unwise decision, is at risk of losing his career entirely. This has happened time and time again. Public health officials such as Dr. Gray in British Columbia and Dr. Colquhoun in New Zealand found no benefit from fluoridation. When they reported these results, they immediately lost their careers…. This is what happens ­ the public health officials who speak out against fluoride are at great risk of losing their careers on the spot.”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>Yiamouyiannis adds that for the authorities to admit that they’re wrong would be devastating. “It would show that their reputations really don’t mean that much…. They don’t have the scientific background. As <a href="http://prn.fm/tag/ralph-nader/">Ralph Nader</a> once said, if they admit they’re wrong on fluoridation, people would ask, and legitimately so, what else have they not told us right?”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>Accompanying a loss in status would be a tremendous loss in revenue. Yiamouyiannis points out that “the indiscriminate careless handling of fluoride has a lot of companies, such as Exxon, U.S. Steel, and Alcoa, making tens of billions of dollars in extra profits at our expense…. For them to go ahead now and admit that this is bad, this presents a problem, a threat, would mean tens of billions of dollars in lost profit because they would have to handle fluoride properly. Fluoride is present in everything from phosphate fertilizers to cracking agents for the petroleum industry.”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>Fluoride could only be legally disposed of at a great cost to industry. As Dr. Bill Marcus explains, “There are prescribed methods for disposal and they’re very expensive. Fluoride is a very potent poison. It’s a registered pesticide, used for killing rats or mice…. If it were to be disposed of, it would require a class-one landfill. That would cost the people who are producing aluminum or fertilizer about $7000+ per 5000- to 6000-gallon truckload to dispose of it. It’s highly corrosive.”<sup> </sup></p>
<p>Another problem is that the U.S. judicial system, even when convinced of the dangers, is powerless to change policy. Yiamouyiannis tells of his involvement in court cases in Pennsylvania and Texas in which, while the judges were convinced that fluoride was a health hazard, they did not have the jurisdiction to grant relief from fluoridation. That would have to be done, it was ultimately found, through the legislative process.<sup> </sup>   Interestingly, the judiciary seems to have more power to effect change in other countries. Yiamouyiannis states that when he presented the same technical evidence in Scotland, the Scottish court outlawed fluoridation based on the evidence.</p>
<p>Indeed, most of Western Europe has rejected fluoridation on the grounds that it is unsafe. In 1971, after 11 years of testing, Sweden’s Nobel Medical Institute recommended against fluoridation, and the process was banned.<sup>93</sup> The Netherlands outlawed the practice in 1976, after 23 years of tests. France decided against it after consulting with its Pasteur Institute<sup>64</sup>   and West Germany, now Germany, rejected the practice because the recommended dosage of 1 ppm was “too close to the dose at which long-term damage to the human body is to be expected.” <sup>84</sup>   Dr. Lee sums it up: “All of western Europe, except one or two test towns in Spain, has abandoned fluoride as a public health plan. It is not put in the water anywhere. They all established test cities and found that the benefits did not occur and the toxicity was evident.”<sup>94</sup></p>
<p>Isn’t it time the United States followed Western Europe’s example? While the answer is obvious, it is also apparent that government policy is unlikely to change without public support. We therefore must communicate with legislators, and insist on one of our most precious resources ­ pure, unadulterated drinking water. Yiamouyiannis urges all American people to do so, pointing out that public pressure has gotten fluoride out of the water in places like Los Angeles; Newark and Jersey City in New Jersey; and <sup>95</sup>Bedford, Massachusetts.<sup> </sup><sup>46</sup> <sup> </sup> He emphasizes the immediacy of the problem: “There is no question with regard to fluoridation of public water supplies. It is absolutely unsafe…and should be stopped immediately. This is causing more destruction to human health than any other single substance added purposely or inadvertently to the water supply. We’re talking about 35,000 excess deaths a year…10,000 cancer deaths a year…130 million people who are being chronically poisoned. We’re not talking about dropping dead after drinking a glass of fluoridated water…. It takes its toll on human health and life, glass after glass.” <sup>96</sup></p>
<p>There is also a moral issue in the debate that has largely escaped notice. According to columnist James Kilpatrick, it is “the right of each person to control the drugs he or she takes.” Kilpatrick calls fluoridation compulsory mass medication, a procedure that violates the principles of medical ethics.<sup> </sup><sup>97</sup>   A New York Times editorial agrees:</p>
<p>“In light of the uncertainty, critics [of fluoridation] argue that administrative bodies are unjustified in imposing fluoridation on communities without obtaining public consent…. The real issue here is not just the scientific debate. The question is whether any establishment has the right to decide that benefits outweigh risks and impose involuntary medication on an entire population. In the case of fluoridation, the dental establishment has made opposition to fluoridation seem intellectually disreputable. Some people regard that as tyranny.”<sup> </sup><sup>98</sup></p>
