<p>The question of war or peace with Iran rests with the policies adopted by the White House and the US Congress.  The peace overtures by newly elected Iranian President Rohani have resonated favorably around the world, except with Israel and its Zionist acolytes in North America and Europe .  The first negotiating session proceeded without recrimination and resulted in an optimistic assessment by both sides.  Precisely because of the initial favorable response among the participants, the Israeli government escalated its propaganda war against Iran .  Its agents in the US Congress, the mass media and in the Executive branch moved to undermine the peace process.  What is at stake is Israel’s capacity to wage proxy wars using the US military and its NATO allies against any government challenging Israeli military supremacy in the Middle East, its violent annexation of Palestinian territory and its ability to attack any adversary with impunity.</p>
<p>To understand what is at stake in the current peace negotiations one must envision the consequences of failure:  Under Israeli pressure, the US announced that its ‘military option’ could be activated – resulting in missile strikes and a bombing campaign against 76 million Iranians in order to destroy their government and economy.  Teheran could retaliate against such aggression by targeting US military bases in the region and Gulf oil installations resulting in a global crisis.  This is what Israel wants.</p>
<p>We will begin by examining the context of Israel ’s military supremacy in the Middle East .  We will then proceed to analyze Israel ’s incredible power over the US political process and how it shapes the negotiation process today, with special emphasis on Zionist power in the US Congress.</p>
<p><strong>The Context of Israeli Military Supremacy in the Middle East</strong></p>
<p>Since the end of World War II , Israel has bombed, invaded and occupied more countries in the Middle East and Africa than previous colonial power, except the US .  The list of Israel ’s victims includes:  Palestine , Syria , Lebanon , Egypt , Iraq , Jordan , Sudan and Yemen .  If we include countries where Israel has launched quasi-clandestine terrorist attacks and assassinations, the list would be greatly expanded to include a dozen countries in Europe and Asia – including the US through its Zionist terror network.</p>
<p>Israel ’s projection of military power, its capacity for waging offensive wars at will, is matched by its near-total impunity.  Despite their repeated violations of international law, including war crimes, Israel has never been censored at an international tribunal or subjected to economic sanctions because the US government uses its position to veto UN Security Council resolutions and pressure its NATO-EU allies.</p>
<p>Israel’s military supremacy has less to do with the native techno-industrial ‘brilliance’ of its war-mongers and more to do with the transfers and outright theft of nuclear, chemical and biological technology and weapons from the US (Grant Smith “Ten Explosive US Government Secrets of Israel” IRMEP).  Overseas Zionists in the US and France have played a strategic (and treasonous) role in stealing and illegally shipping nuclear technology and weapon components to Israel, according to an investigation by former CIA Director Richard Helms.</p>
<p>Israel maintains huge nuclear, chemical, and biological weapon stockpiles refusing any access to international arms inspectors and is not obliged to abide by the non-proliferation treaty, because of US diplomatic intervention.  Under pressure from the local ‘Zionist power configuration’ (ZPC), the US government has blocked any action which might constrain Israel ’s production of weapons of mass destruction.  In fact the US continues to provide Israel with strategic weapons of mass destruction for use against its neighbors – in violation of international law.</p>
<p>US military aid and technology transfers to Israel exceed $100 billion dollars over the past half century.  US diplomatic and military intervention was crucial in rescuing Israel from defeat during the 1973 war.  US President Lyndon Johnson’s refusal to defend the unarmed intelligence ship, the USS Liberty in 1967, after it had been bombed and napalmed by Israeli fighter planes and warships in international waters, constituted a tremendous victory for Israel thanks to Johnson’s Zionist advisers.  Because of its impunity, even in killing American servicemen, Israel has been given a free hand to wage aggressive wars to dominate its neighbors, commit acts of terrorism and assassinate its adversaries throughout the world without fear of retaliation.</p>
<p>Israel ’s uncontested military superiority  has converted several of its neighbors to quasi-client collaborators:  Egypt and Jordan have served as de facto allies, along with the Gulf monarchies, helping Israel repress the region’s nationalist and pro-Palestinian movements.</p>
<p>The most decisive factor in the rise and consolidation of Israel ’s power in the Middle East has not been its military prowess but its political reach and influence via its Zionist agents in the US .  Washington ’s wars against   Iraq and Libya , and its current support of the mercenary assault against Syria , have destroyed three major secular nationalist opponents of Israel ’s hegemonic ambitions.</p>
<p>As Israel accumulates more power in the region, expanding its colonization of Palestinian territory, it looks eastward toward destroying the last remaining obstacle to its colonial policies:  Iran .</p>
<p>For at least two decades, Israel has directed its overseas agents – (the ZPC) – to destroy the government of Iran by destabilizing its society, assassinating its scientists, bombing its military establishments and laboratories and strangling its economy.</p>
<p>After the ZPC successfully pushed the US into war against Iraq in 2003 – literally shredding its complex secular society and killing over a million Iraqis – it turned its sights on destroying Lebanon (Hezbollah) and the secular government of Syria as a way to isolate Iran and prepare for an attack.  While thousands of Lebanese civilians were slaughtered in 2006, Israel ’s attack of Lebanon failed, despite the support of the US government and the ZPC’s wild propaganda campaign.  Hysterical at its failure and to ‘compensate’ for its defeat at the hands of Hezbollah and to ‘boost morale’, Israel invaded and destroyed much of Gaza (2008/9) – the world’s largest open air prison camp.</p>
<p>Lacking military capacity to attack Iran on its own, Israel directed its agents to manipulate the US government to start a war with Teheran.  The militarist leaders in Tel Aviv have unleashed their political assets (ZPC) throughout the US  to work to destroy Iran – the last formidable adversary to Israel supremacy in the Middle East .</p>
<p>The Israeli-ZPC strategy is designed to set the stage for a US confrontation with Iran , using its agents in the Executive branch as well as its ongoing corruption, bribery and control of the US Congress.  ZPC control over the mass media enhances its propaganda campaign:  Everyday the New York Times and the Washington Post publish articles and editorials promoting Israel ’s war agenda.  The  ZPC uses the US State Department to force other NATO states to likewise confront Iran .</p>
<p><strong>Israel’s Proxy War with Iran:  US Political Pressure, Economic Sanctions and Military Threats</strong></p>
<p>Alone, Israel’s ‘war’ with Iran would not amount to much more than its cyber sabotage, the periodical assassinations of Iranian scientists using its paid agents among Iranian terrorist groups and non-stop brow-beating from Israeli politicians and their ‘amen crowd’.  Outside of Israel , this campaign has had little impact on public opinion.  Israel’s ‘was’ on Iran depends exclusively on its capacity to manipulate US policy using its local agents and groups who dominate the US Congress and through the appointments of officials in key positions in the Departments of Treasury, Commerce, and Justice , and as Middle East ‘advisors’.  Israel cannot organize an effective sanction campaign against Iran ; nor could it influence any major power to abide by such a campaign.  Only the US has that power.  Israel ’s dominance in the Middle East comes entirely from its capacity to mobilize its proxies in the United States who are assigned the task of securing total submission to   Israel ’s interests from elected and appointed government officials – especially in regard to Israel ’s regional adversaries.</p>
<p>Strategically placed, ‘dual US-Israeli citizens’ have used their US citizenship to secure high security positions in the Government directly involved in policies affecting Israel .  As Israelis, their activities are in line with the dictates of Tel Aviv.  In the Bush administration (2001-2008) high placed ‘Israel Firsters’ dominated the Pentagon (Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith), Middle East Security (Martin Indyk, Dennis Ross), the Vice President’s office (‘Scooter’ Libby), Treasury (Levey) and Homeland Security (Michael Chertoff).  In the Obama administration the ‘Israel Firsters’ include Dennis Ross, Rahm Emanuel, David Cohen, Secretary of Treasury Jack “Jake the Snake” Lew, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and Michael Froman as Trade Representative among others.</p>
<p>Israel ’s Proxy Power within the Executive branch is matched by its dominance of the US Congress.    Contrary to some critics, Israel is neither an ‘ally’ or ‘client’ of the US .  Evidence of the gross asymmetry of the relation abounds over the past half century.  Because of these powerful proxies in Congress and the Executive branch, Israel has received over $100 billion dollar tribute from the US over the past 30 years, or $3 billion plus a year.  The US Pentagon has transferred the most up-to-date military technology and engaged in several wars on Israel ’s behalf.  The US Treasury has imposed sanctions against potentially lucrative trading and investment partners in the Middle East ( Iran , Iraq and Syria ) depriving US agricultural and manufacturing exporters and oil companies of over $500 billion in revenues.  The White House sacrificed the lives of over 4,400 US soldiers in the Iraq War – a war promoted by Israel ’s proxies at the behest of Israel ’s leaders.  The State Department has rejected friendly and profitable relations with over 1.5 billion Muslims by backing the illegal settlement of over half million Jewish colonists on military-occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank and Jerusalem .</p>
<p>The strategic question is how and why this one-sided relation between the US and Israel persists for so long, even as it goes counter to so many strategic and elite US interests?  The more immediate and pressing question is how this historically lopsided relation effects contemporary US-Iran sanctions and nuclear negotiations?</p>
<p><strong>Iran and the Peace Negotiations</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1383401474820_2409">Undoubtedly the newly elected Iranian President and his Foreign Minister are prepared to negotiate an end to hostilities with the US by making major concessions ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  They have stated they are open to reducing or even ending the production of highly enriched uranium; reducing the number of centrifuges and even allowing intrusive, unannounced inspections, among other promising proposals.  The Iranian government proposes a roadmap with end goals as part of the initial agreements.  The European Union’s Foreign Secretary Lady Ashton has commented favorably on the initial meeting.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1383401474820_2412"> The US Administration has given conflicting signals following the Iranian overtures and the opening meeting.  Some individual comments are guardedly positive; others are less encouraging and rigid.  Administration Zionists like Jack ‘Jake’ Lew, the Treasury Secretary, insists sanctions will remain until Iran meets all US (read ‘Israeli’) demands.  The US Congress, bought and controlled by the ZPC, rejects the promising Iranian overtures and flexibility, insisting on military ‘options’ or the total dismantling of Iran’s legal and peaceful nuclear program – ZPC positions designed to sabotage the negotiations.  To that end, Congress has passed new, more extreme, economic sanctions to strangle the Iran ’s oil economy.</p>
<p> <strong> How Israel’s Political Action Committees Control the US Congress and Prepare War with Iran</strong></p>
<p>The Zionist Power Configuration uses its financial firepower to dictate Congressional policy on the Middle East and to ensure that the US Congress and Senate do not stray one iota from serving Israel ’s interests.  The Zionist instrument used in the purchase of elected officials in the US is the political action committee (PAC).</p>
<p>Thanks to a 2010 US Supreme Court decision, Super PACs-linked to Israel spend enormous sums  to elect or destroy candidates – depending on the candidate’s political work on behalf of Israel .  As long as these funds do not go directly to the candidate, these Super PACs do not have to reveal how much they spend or how it is spent.  Conservative estimates of ZPC- linked direct and indirect funds to US legislators run close to $100 million dollars over the past 30-year.  The ZPC channels these funds to legislative leaders and members of Congressional committees dealing with foreign policy, especially sub-committee  chairpersons dealing with the Middle East .  Unsurprisingly, the largest Congressional recipients of ZPC money are those who have aggressively promoted Israel ’s hard-line policies.  Elsewhere around the world, such large scale payoffs for legislative votes would be considered blatant bribery and subject to felony prosecution­ and imprisonment for both parties.  In the US , the purchase and sale of a politician’s vote is called ‘lobbying’ and is legal and open.  The legislative branch of the US government has come to resemble a high-price brothel or white slavers’ auction – but with the lives of thousands at stake.</p>
<p>The ZPC has purchased the alliance of US Congress people and Senators on a massive scale:  Of 435 members of the US House of Representatives (sic), 219 have received payments from the ZPC in exchange for their votes on behalf of the state of Israel .  Corruption is even more rampant among the 100 US Senators, 94 of whom have accepted pro-Israel PAC and Super PAC money for their loyalty to Israel .  The ZPC showers money on both Republicans and Democrats, thus securing incredible (in this era of Congressional deadlock), near unanimous (‘bipartisan’) votes in favor of the ‘Jewish State’, including its war crimes, like the bombing of Gaza and Lebanon as well as the annual $3 billion dollar plus US tax-payer tribute to Tel Aviv.  At least 50 US Senators have each collected between $100 thousand and $1 million in ZPC money over the past decades .  In exchange, they have voted for over $100 billion in tribute payments to Israel … in addition to other ‘services and payments’.  The members of the US Congress are cheaper:  25 legislators have received between $238,000 and $50,000, while the rest got peanuts.  Regardless of the amount, the net result is the same: Congressional member pick up their script from their Zionist mentors in the PACs, Super PACs and AIPAC and back all of Israel ’s wars in the Middle East and promote US aggression on behalf of Israel .</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1383401474820_2425">The most outspoken and influential legislators get the biggest chunk of Zionist payola: Senator Mark Kirk (Bombs over Teheran!) tops the ‘pigs at the trough’ list with $925,000 in ZPC payoffs, followed by John McCain (Bombs over Damascus!) with $771,000, while Senators Mitch McConnell, Carl Levin, Robert Menendez, Richard Durban and other Zionophilic politicos are  not shy about holding out their little begging bowls when the pro-Israel PAC bagmen arrive!   Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen tops the ‘House’ list with $238,000 for her 100% pro-Israel record as well as for being more war-mongering than even Netanyahu!  Eric Cantor got $209,000 for championing ‘wars for Israel ’ with American lives while cutting Social Security payments to US seniors in order to increase military aid to Tel Aviv.  House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, got $144,000 for ‘whipping the few wobbly’ Democrats back into Israel ’s ‘camp’.  House Majority Leader John Boehner was paid $130,000 to do the same among the Republicans.</p>
<p> The ZPC has spent huge amounts to punish and destroy a dozen or so dissident legislators who had stood up to Israel ’s wars and grotesque human rights record.  The ZPC has poured millions into individual campaigns, not only financing opposition candidates who pledged allegiance to the Israel but mounting scurrilous character assassinations of Israel’s critics in office.  These campaigns have been mounted in the most obscure parts of the US , including in majority African-American districts, where local Zionist interests and influence are otherwise absolutely nil.</p>
<p>There are no comparable PACs, Super PACs, party leaders, or civic organization that can contest the power of Israel ’s Fifth Column.  According to documents archived by the courageous researcher, Grant Smith of IRMEP, when it comes to Israel , the US Justice Department has adamantly refused to enforce its own federal laws requiring the prosecution of US citizens who fail to register as foreign agents while working for a foreign country – at least since 1963.  On the other hand, the ZPC, through the so-call ‘Anti-Defamation League’, has successfully pressured the Justice Department, the FBI and NSA to investigate and prosecute law-abiding, patriotic US citizens critical of Israel ’s land grabs in Palestine and the Zionist corruptors of the US political system on behalf of their foreign master.</p>
<p>The corruption and degradation of US democracy is made possible by the equally compromised and corrupted ‘respectable press’.  Media critic, Steve Lendman, has pointed out the direct link between Israel and the mass media in his investigation of the New York Times.  The leading (‘fair and balanced’) journalists reporting on Israel have strong family and political ties to that country and their articles have been little more than propaganda.  Times reporter Ethan Bronner, whose son served in the Israel Defense Forces, is a long-time apologist for the Zionist state.  Times reporter Isabel Kershner, whose ‘writing’ seem to come straight out of the Israeli Foreign Office, is married to Hirsh Goodman an adviser to the Netanyahu regime on ‘security affairs’.  The Times bureau chief in Jerusalem, Jodi Rudoren, lives comfortably in the ancestral home of a Palestinian family dispossessed from that ancient city.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1383401474820_2436"> The Times unflinching pro-Israel posture provides a political cover and justification for the corrupted US politicians as they beat the war drums for Israel .  It is no surprise that the New York Times, like the Washington Post, is deeply engaged in disparaging and denouncing the current US-Iran negotiations – and providing ample space for the one-sided rhetoric of Israeli politicians and their US mouthpieces, while studiously excluding the more rational, pro-rapprochement voices of experienced former US diplomats, war-weary military leaders and representatives of the US business and academic communities.</p>
<p> To understand Congress’ hostility to the nuclear negotiations with Iran and their efforts to scuttle them through the imposition of ridiculous new sanctions, it is important to get to the source of the problem, namely the statements of key Israeli politicians, who set the line of march for their US proxies.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1383401474820_2440">In late October, 2013, Former Israeli Defense Intelligence Chief Amos Yadlin spoke of ‘having to choose between ‘the bomb’ or the bombing’ – a message which immediately resonated with the 52 Presidents of the Major American Jewish Organizations (Daily Alert, October 24, 2013).  On October 22, 2013, Israel ’s Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, called for harsh new sanctions on Iran and insisted that the US use them as leverage to demand that Iran agree to entirely abandon its peaceful nuclear energy and enrichment program.  Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon affirmed that ‘ Israel will not accept any deal that allows Iran to enrich uranium’.  It is Israel ’s position to threaten war (via the US ) if Iran does not submit to unconditional surrender of its nuclear program.  This defines the position of all the major pro-Israel PACs, Super PACs and AIPAC.  They in turn proceed to dictate policy to their ‘lick-spittles’ in the US Congress.  As a result, Congress passes even more extreme economic sanctions on Iran in order to sabotage the ongoing negotiations.</p>
<p> Those who have received the biggest Zionist pay-offs from the pro-Israel PACs are the most vociferous:  Senator Mark Kirk ($925,379), author of a previous sanctions bill, demands that Iran end its entire nuclear and ballistic missile program (!) and declared that the US Senate “should immediately move forward with a new round of economic sanctions targeting all remaining Iranian government revenue and reserves” (Financial Times, 10/18/13, p. 6).  The US House of Representatives (sic) has already passed a bill sharply limiting Iran ’s ability to sell its main export, oil.   Once again, the Israel- ZPC – Congressional axis seeks to impose Israel ’s war agenda on the American people!  In late October 2013, Secretary of State Kerry was ‘grilled’ for 7 hours by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu with the craven Kerry promising to promote Israel ’s agenda on dismantling Iran ’s nuclear enrichment program.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1383401474820_2461">To counter the campaign to strangle Iran ’s oil economy, promoted by Israel ’s flunkeys in the Congress, the Iranian government has offered generous contracts to the US and EU oil companies (Financial Times 10/29/2013, p 1).  Existing nationalist provisions are being removed.  Under the new terms, foreign companies book reserves or take equity stakes in Iranian projects.  Iran hopes to attract at least $100 billion dollars in investments over the next three years.  This stable country boasts the world’s largest gas and the fourth largest oil reserves.  Because of the current US ( Israel )-imposed sanctions, production has fallen from 3.5 million barrels per day in 2011 to 2.58 million barrels per day in 2013.  The question is whether ‘Big Oil’, the giant US and EU companies have to power to challenge the ZPC-stranglehold over US-EU sanction policy.  So far, the ZPC has dominated this critical policy and marginalized ‘Big Oil’ using threats, blackmail and coercion against US policymakers.  This has effectively shut out US companies from the lucrative Iranian market.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1383401474820_2453">As the US and the 5 other countries attempt to negotiate with Iran , they face enormous obstacles overcoming Israel ’s power over the US Congress.  Over  past decades Israel ’s agents have bought the loyalties of the vast majority of Congress people, training them to recognize and obey the whistles, signals and script from the war mongers in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1383401474820_2456">This ‘Axis of War’, has inflicted enormous damage on the world resulting in the deaths of millions of victims of US wars in the Middle East, Southwest Asia and North Africa .  The gross corruption and widely recognized bankruptcy of the US legislative system is due to its slavish submission to a foreign power.  What remains in Washington is a debased vassal state despised by its own citizens.  If the ZPC controlled Congress succeeds once again in destroying the negotiations between the US and Iran via new war-like resolutions, we, the American people, will have to pay an enormous price in lives and treasure.</p>
<p> The time to act is now.  It is time to stand up and expose the role played by the Israeli PACs, Super PACs and the 52 Major American Jewish Organization in corrupting Congress and turning “our” elected representatives into flunkeys for Israel’s wars.  There has been a deafening silence from our noted critics –few alternative media critics have attacked Israel ’s power over the US Congress.  The evidence is openly available, the crimes are undeniable.  The American people need real political leaders with the courage to root out the corrupted and corruptors and force their elected members in the House and Senate to represent the interest of the American people.</p>

			<p><strong>The NBC star tells his viewers that Iranian leaders are &#8216;suddenly claiming they don&#8217;t want nuclear weapons&#8217;, even though they&#8217;ve been saying it for years&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/brianwilliams-propaganda3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/brianwilliams-propaganda2.jpg" align="left" /></a>There is ample reason for skepticism that anything substantial will change in <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Iran" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>-US relations, beginning with the fact that numerous US political and media figures are vested in the narrative that Iran is an evil threat whose desire for a peaceful resolution must not be trusted (and some hard-line factions in Iran are similarly vested in ongoing conflict). Whatever one&#8217;s views are on the prospects for improving relations, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/obama-phone-call-iranian-president-rouhani">first direct communications in more than 30 years</a> between the leaders of those two countries is a historically significant event.</p>
<p><a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/27/20722870-obama-and-rouhani-make-history-with-phone-call-thawing-three-decade-freeze-between-us-and-iran?lite">Here is what NBC News anchor Brian Williams told his viewers</a> about this event when leading off his broadcast last night, with a particularly mocking and cynical tone used for the bolded words:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is all part of a new leadership effort by Iran -<strong> suddenly claiming they don&#8217;t want nuclear weapons! </strong>; what they want is talks and transparency and good will. And while that would be enough to define a whole new era, skepticism is high and there&#8217;s a good reason for it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Iran&#8217;s claim that they don&#8217;t want nuclear weapons sure is &#8220;sudden&#8221; &#8211; if you pretend that virtually everything that they&#8217;ve said on that question for the past ten years does not exist. <a href="http://rt.com/politics/ahmadinejad-exclusive-interview-rt/">Here</a>, for instance, is previous Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in an August 13, 2011, interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;<strong>Q</strong>: &#8216;Are you saying that at some point in the future you may want to acquire a nuclear deterrent, a nuclear weapon?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;<strong>Ahmadinejad</strong>: &#8216;Never, never. We do not want nuclear weapons. We do not seek nuclear weapons. This is an inhumane weapon. Because of our beliefs we are against that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firstly, our religion says it is prohibited. We are a religious people. Secondly, nuclear weapons have no capability today. If any country tries to build a nuclear bomb, they in fact waste their money and resources and they create great danger for themselves. . . .</p>
<p>&#8220;Nuclear weapons are the weapons of the previous century. This century is the century of knowledge and thinking, the century of human beings, the century of culture and logic. . . . Our goal in the country and the goal of our people is peace for all. Nuclear energy for all, and nuclear weapons for none. This is our goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;All nuclear activities in Iran are monitored by the IAEA. There have been no documents against Iran from the agency. It&#8217;s just a claim by the US that we are after nuclear weapons. But they have no evidence that Iran is diverting resources to that purpose.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, the country&#8217;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, issued a 2005 religious edict banning the pursuit of nuclear weapons, and in January of this year, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57564199/iran-religious-decree-against-nuclear-weapons-is-binding/">Iranian official Ramin Mehmanparast declared</a>: &#8220;There is nothing higher than the exalted supreme leader&#8217;s fatwa to define the framework for our activities in the nuclear field.&#8221; He added: &#8220;We are the first country to call for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons. When the highest jurist and authority in the country&#8217;s leadership issues a fatwa, this will be binding for all of us to follow. So, this fatwa will be our top agenda.&#8221;<br />
The following month, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/world/middleeast/supreme-leader-says-iran-not-seeking-nuclear-arms.html?_r=0">Khamenei himself said</a>: &#8220;We believe that nuclear weapons must be eliminated. We don&#8217;t want to build atomic weapons.&#8221; The New York Times noted that &#8220;American officials say they believe that Ayatollah Khamenei exercises full control over Iran&#8217;s nuclear program.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are identical to the statements top Iranian officials have been making for years. <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/nuclear-weapons-are-a-sin-says-irans-ayatollah-ali-khamenei">In 2012, Khamenei</a> &#8220;insisted his country was not seeking nuclear weapons, claiming that &#8216;holding these arms is a sin as well as useless, harmful and dangerous.&#8217;&#8221; The following month, Iran&#8217;s top leader gave what <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2012/03/khamenei-takes-control-forbids-nuclear-bomb.html">Professor Juan Cole described at the time</a> as &#8220;a major foreign policy speech&#8221; and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Iranian nation has never pursued and will never pursue nuclear weapons. There is no doubt that the decision makers in the countries opposing us know well that Iran is not after nuclear weapons because the Islamic Republic, logically, religiously and theoretically, considers the possession of nuclear weapons a grave sin and believes the proliferation of such weapons is senseless, destructive and dangerous.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Can that be any more absolute? Iran&#8217;s top leadership has been making <a href="http://www.mohammadmossadegh.com/news/iran-the-nuclear-assumption/">similarly unambiguous statements for almost a full decade</a>, even taking out <a href="http://www.mohammadmossadegh.com/news/unnecessary-crisis-iran-nuclear-program/">a full page ad in the New York Times in 2005</a> to counter the growing clamor in the US for a military attack by proclaiming that Iran had no desire for nuclear weapons, was not pursuing them, and wanted transparency, accountability and peace &#8211; exactly what Brian Williams told his viewers last night was a &#8220;sudden&#8221; and newfound claim.</p>
<p>Obviously, the fact that Iran claims it does not want nuclear weapons is not proof that it is not seeking them or will not seek them at some point in the future; all government statements should be subjected to skepticism (and one can only dream of the day when US media stars subject the statements of their own government to the same skepticism accorded to those of leaders of non-allied countries). But what is true is that <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/23/world/la-fg-iran-intel-20120224">US intelligence agencies have repeatedly though secretly concluded</a> that they do not believe that Iran is building a nuclear weapon, and even top Israeli military officials <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2012/0425/Israeli-army-chief-says-he-doubts-Iran-will-build-a-nuclear-weapon">have expressed serious doubts</a> that Iran is building, or will build, a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>But whether Iran is sincere is an entirely separate question from the one about which Williams radically misled his viewers last night. While Iran&#8217;s actual intentions regarding nuclear weapons may be debatable, the fact that they have repeatedly and over the course of many years emphatically disclaimed any interest in acquiring nuclear weapons is not debatable. It is indisputable fact that they have done exactly that. There is nothing new or &#8220;sudden&#8221; about this claim.</p>
<p>To the contrary, Iran has been trying to make Americans hear for years that they have no interest in nuclear weapons. Indeed, they have repeatedly made clear that they have not only banned such weapons but favor region-wide nuclear disarmament, including of Israel&#8217;s vast nuclear arsenal, which actually exists. It is Israel, not Iran, which has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Jlem-rejects-UN-call-to-open-nuke-program-to-probe">steadfastly refused to allow inspections of its nuclear arsenal</a> (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/04/un-tells-israel-nuclear-inspectors">despite UN demands they do so</a>) or <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/277058">to join the NPT</a> or other conventions designed to monitor and regulate nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>But these facts have been excluded almost entirely from the dominant US media narrative for years. The fact that Iran, at its highest leadership levels, has repeatedly and unequivocally disavowed any interest in nuclear weapons is something that most Americans simply don&#8217;t know, because the country&#8217;s media stars have barely ever mentioned it. Brian Williams himself was either ignorant of this history, or chose to pretend last night that it did not happen when framing this historic event for his viewers.</p>
<p>Whichever of those two options is true, NBC News feels free to spout such plainly false propaganda &#8211; &#8220;suddenly claiming they don&#8217;t want nuclear weapons!&#8221; &#8211; because they know they and fellow large media outlets have done such an effective job in keeping their viewers ignorant of these facts. They thus believe that they can sow doubts about Iran&#8217;s intentions with little danger that their deceit will be discovered. Many NBC News viewers have likely never heard before that Iran has emphatically claimed not to want nuclear weapons and have even formally banned them, and thus are easily misled into believing Williams when he tells them that these current claims represent some &#8220;sudden&#8221;, inexplicable, and bizarre reversal that are not to be trusted.</p>

<p>The Israelis are not very impressed with Hassan Rouhani, the new Iranian president. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Israel’s delegation to boycott his appearance at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday and later denounced Rouhani’s address there as “a cynical speech that was full of hypocrisy.”</p>
<p>But Israel seems to be alone this time.  Both the United States and other Western nations appeared to warmly welcome the new Iranian president at the UN. </p>
<p>But did Rouhani present any radical change? Did he deliver new promises? Not at all. Like his predecessor, he made it clear that Iran is not going to give up on its right to proceed and develop nuclear energy. Like Ahmadinejad, Rouhani contended that  &#8220;nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran&#8217;s security and defence doctrine, and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions. Our national interests make it imperative that we remove any and all reasonable concerns about Iran&#8217;s peaceful nuclear program.&#8221;</p>
<p>The President also suggested that the world should recognise Iran&#8217;s basic right to carry out all parts of its nuclear fuel cycle. In short, Iran is going ahead with its nuclear project. And this is indeed very good news.</p>
<p>So what changed really?  Only one thing, I guess. The nations seem to have changed their appetite. And they are somehow brave enough to admit it to themselves.</p>
<p>Due to some intense Jewish lobbying and the submissive nature of contemporary Western politicians, not many Western governments dare criticise Israel. They clearly fear Netanyahu and his network of <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/09/13/the-people-against-the-800-pound-gorilla/">‘800 pound gorillas’</a>. By means of kindness towards Israel’s ‘enemy’, our weak politicians have managed to find a way to deliver a message to Israel. Welcoming Rouhani at the UN was a clear message to the Jewish State and its supportive lobby: beware, we are gradually becoming tired of your dirty politics and pushing for wars.</p>
<p>Being an avid reader of Jewish history, I allow myself to say that the failure to read the writing on the wall is intrinsic to Jewish identity politics and culture. One might expect Israel and the Lobby to back off at this point. But this is not going to happen. Israel and the Lobby will act more obnoxiously. They will use every trick in their book to close this opening window of a dialogue and reconciliation.  </p>
<p>Israel is doomed to bring a tragedy on itself and the region. Even God won’t be able to save his chosen people from themselves. But there is something the UN can do: stripping Israel of its chemical, biological and nuclear arsenal. I can see such a demand brewing up and I would love to see it materialising soon.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fukushima-mon-amour-mypouss3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fukushima-mon-amour-mypouss2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Fukushima shows us how a nuclear disaster can continue forever.</p>
<p>More than two years after the catastrophe, Japanese officialdom has raised the severity of the calamity from one to three (on a scale of seven). The threat elevation is due to massive amounts of radioactive water leaking out of the site.</p>
<p><em>“The quantities of water they are dealing with are absolutely gigantic,”</em> nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23779561" target="_blank">told the BBC</a>. <em>“It is much worse than we have been led to believe, much worse.”</em></p>
<p>This is having an impact on everything from the water supply to the surrounding oceans.</p>
<p><em>“Our biggest concern right now is if some of the other isotopes such as Strontium-90, which tend to be more mobile, get through these sediments in the groundwater,”</em> scientist Ken Buesseler said. <em>“They are entering the oceans at levels that then will accumulate in seafood and will cause new health concerns.”</em></p>
<p>The horror stories just keep on accumulating, as Harvey Wasserman <a href="http://progressive.org/fukushima-nightmare-gets-worse" target="_blank">documents for <em>The Progressive</em></a>.</p>
<p><em>“A plague of damaged thyroids has already been reported among as many as 40 percent of the children in the Fukushima area,”</em> he writes. <em>“Cesium-137 from Fukushima has been found in fish caught as far away as California.”</em></p>
<p>It’s not shocking, then, that Fukushima is causing the world to take a long, hard look at nuclear energy.</p>
<p><em>“It has profoundly shaken confidence in the future of nuclear power, from Taiwan—where earlier this month MPs resorted to fisticuffs as they debated a referendum on a new nuclear power station—to Berlin,”</em> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/21/fukushima-nuclear-global-fallout-editorial" target="_blank"><em>The Guardian</em> notes</a>.</p>
<p><em>“The kind of cascade of devastating events that hit Fukushima hadn’t previously been factored into risk probability assessments,”</em> the paper says. <em>“Now regulatory authorities all over the world have been forced to consider whether, however unlikely, more than one accident could happen in quick succession, and what the consequences would be.”</em></p>
<p>The continuing calamity has put a crimp in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s grandiose plans to go in for a full-scale nuclear revival.</p>
<p><em>“Even before news of the new leak, a majority of the public was against restarts, according to a Kyodo News poll taken July 13-14, with 51 percent opposing and 40 percent in favor of reviving Japan’s nuclear program,”</em> <em>Bloomberg News</em> reports. <em>“The latest revelation could further sway sentiment against nuclear power, according to Koichi Nakano, professor of politics at Sophia University in Tokyo.”</em></p>
<p>However, for something that has such ongoing significance, there’s comparatively little current coverage of Fukushima in the American media.</p>
<p><em>“Unlike other environmental catastrophes like BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Fukushima crisis offers little to film,”</em> Eric Ozawa writes for <em>The Nation</em>. <em>“And so the story, when it gets reported, rarely gets the attention it deserves.”</em></p>
<p>Don’t let that fool you, though. Fukushima is one of the most consequential events of recent years and has huge implications for the types of energy sources we choose—and the type of world we’d like to live in.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fukushima-fallout-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fukushima-fallout-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Radiation leaks, steam releases, disease and death continue to spew from Fukushima and a disaster which is far from over. Its most profound threat to the global ecology—a spent fuel fire—is still very much with us.</p>
<p>The latest steam leak has raised fears around the planet. A worst-case scenario of an on-going out-of-control fission reaction was dismissed by the owners, Tokyo Electric, because they didn’t find xenon in the plume. The company says the steam likely came from rain water being vaporized by residual heat in one of the plant’s stricken reactors.</p>
<p>But independent experts tend to disbelieve anything Tepco says, for good reason. Reactor Units One, Two and Three have exploded at Fukushima despite decades of official assurances that commercial atomic power plants could not explode at all. The company has been unable to clear out enough radioactive debris to allow it to put a cover over the site that might contain further airborne emissions.</p>
<p>Tepco has also been forced to admit that it has been leaking radioactive water into the ocean ever since the disaster began on March 11, 2011. In one instance it admitted to a 90-fold increase of Cesium in a nearby test well over a period of just 3 days.</p>
<p>Earlier this year a rat ate through critical electrical cables, shorting out a critical cooling system. When Tepco workers were dispatched to install metal guards to protect the cabling, they managed to short out the system yet again.</p>
<p>Early this month, Fukushima’s former chief operator, Masao Yoshida, died of esophogeal cancer at the age of 58. Masao became a hero during the worst of the disaster by standing firm at his on-site command post as multiple explosions rocked the reactor complex. Tepco claimed his ensuing cancer and death were “unlikely” to have been caused by Fukushima’s radiation.</p>
<p>The impact of work in and near the reactors has become a rising concern. Critics have warned that there are not enough skilled technicians willing to sacrifice themselves at the plant. Tepco has worsened the situation by applying to open a number of its shut reactors elsewhere in Japan, straining its already depleted skilled workforce even further.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a staggering 40% rise in thyroid irregularities among young children in the area has caused a deepening concern about widespread health impacts from Fukushima’s fallout within the general public. Because these numbers have come in just two years after the disaster, the percentage of affected children is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<p>And the worst fear of all remains unabated. At Unit Four, which apparently did not actually explode, the building’s structural integrity has been seriously undermined. Debate continues to rage over exactly how this happened.</p>
<p>But there’s no doubt that a pool containing many tons of highly radioactive used fuel is suspended 100 feet in the air, with little left to support the structure. Should an earthquake or other trauma knock the pool to the ground, there’s a high likelihood the fuel rods could catch fire.</p>
<p>In such an event, the radioactive emissions could be catastrophic. Intensely lethal emissions could spew for a very long time, eventually circling the globe many times, wrecking untold havoc.</p>
<p>The Japanese have removed two apparently unused rods from the fuel pool so far. But intense international pressure to clear out the rest of them has thus far been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>So while a depleted, discredited and disorganized nuclear utility moves to restart its other reactors, its stricken units at Fukushima continue to hold the rest of us at the brink of apocalyptic terror.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/iranianpeople3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/iranianpeople2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Truth told, this American observer has attended his share of international conferences and has traveled in more than 70 countries. But never has he visited such  a complex country, evolving culture,  and striving  energized society, populated by idealistic people of great warmth, sense of humor and caring for those in need as he experiences in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Except when traveling in his own country.</p>
<p>Being in Iran during these tense times is to experience an epiphany. Which is that Iranians and Americans have so very many needs and interests in common-yes even in our religious beliefs- that both peoples should immediately repair our countries relations and return to the days when 60,000 Iranian students studied in the US and thousands of Americans lived and worked in Iran- all in singular harmony and with myriad mutual benefits.</p>
<p>The deep connection among Muslims and Christians from the seventh century sacrifice at Karbala by Hussein bin Ali and the first century sacrifice at Calvary by Jesus Christ, established forever a claimed divine principle of sacrifice of one’s self to resist injustice for the greater good of the community. This bond underpins and connects the two religions and their followers inextricably.</p>
<p>There is probably no country more misunderstood in America than Iran And its due almost entirely to politically motivated demonizations and misrepresentations, including, but not limited to, what President Ahmadinejad really said during speeches relating to the US and the West and the historical imperative to liberate occupied Palestine and every country’s right to develop nuclear energy and to live independently and free of US-led western hegemony. Most Americans&#8217; perceptions of Iran, according to Iranian friends, are limited to images of President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad accused of delivering anti-American speeches.</p>
<p>Another example is the media reports of the 2/09/13 celebration of the 34<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Iranian revolution where the BBC and most other media reported the crowds were “frenzied and chanting death to America.”  I was there and this report is rubbish.  I did hear from time to time a few chants mixed in with revolutionary songs, religious exhortations, and just plain fun. Helping others by offering water and heavy laden older citizens or kids was the motif.</p>
<p>People were happy not angry and they could not have been more friendly or curious about the Americans they came upon and who helped them pick up Iranian leaflet flags that blew or were dropped onto the streets as the Americans understood Iranian pride in their flag and not wanting to see it walked on or subjected to disrespect.</p>
<p>One does not have to look further than the morning newspapers for examples and to find the likes of Zionist apologist, Iranophobe and Islamophode Jennifer Rubin, in her Washington Post screed.  Ms. Rubin, on Valentine’s Day had only poisonous invective in her heart for any American- even cupid one imagines- who would dare express any remotely objective idea about Iran. Rubin, a former AIPAC volunteer, lambasted Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, former US Senator, Chuck Hagel, as nearly all 52 Zionist organizations in America have done this past month, because he advocates mutual respect and friendship with Iran. Hagel’s unforgiveable sins includee his words on the subject of criminal US-led sanctions against Iran and Syria and the need to build trust and normalize relations through dialogue.</p>
<p>Said Hagel about U.S.-Iran relations: “We shouldn’t be putting conditions on talks or putting all other issues to the side except one issue that we will ‘dictate’ to Iran.”    As far back as 2007, Hagel stated that “In the Middle East of the 21st century, Iran will be a key center of gravity… a significant regional power. The United States cannot change that reality. America’s strategic 21st-century regional policy for the Middle East must acknowledge the role of Iran today and over the next 25 years.” Hagel continued: “On Afghanistan, the United States and Iran found common interests — defeating the Taliban and Islamic radicals, stabilizing Afghanistan, stopping the opium production and the flow of opium coming into Iran. From these common interests emerged common actions working toward a common purpose. It was in the interests of Iran to work with the U.S. in Afghanistan. It was not a matter of helping America or strengthening America’s presence in Central Asia. It was a clear-eyed and self-serving action for Iran.”</p>
<p>Hagel may have erred a bit on Afghanistan and the Taliban, but Rubin found Hagel’s point of view treasonous and has joined the  the US Zionist lobby’s call for a witch-hunt when she asks her readers: “Why would the president select someone so deferential toward the Islamic revolutionary government? ..During the Congressional recess, the Senate should think about that. <i>And it might be interesting to find out who was helping him with these intensely pro-Tehran speeches.</i></p>
<h3>In Iran today one does not hear Rubinesque hate speech or even lectures about the 1953 US-UK overthrow of Iranian leader <em>Mohammad</em> Mossedeg or the shooting down on July 3, 1988 of the commercial passenger aircraft Iran Air Flight 655 (IIR655) or the US giving chemical weapons to Iraq, during its US backed aggression, or even the assassination of Iranian scientists or a number of other US green lighted aggressions against the country.</h3>
<p>Much more often, conversations are likely to turn to the need to improve relations and friendly questions about what foreigners are experiencing in Iran and if they need assistance in doing something or information about their country.  Iranians are as open as Americans are by their very nature, and unlike many other countries no subject for discussion is taboo. For this observer it included  topics such as the “morality police”, execution of drug dealers and homosexuals, “stoning” of women,  attacks on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a title="Bahá'í Faith" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith" target="_blank">Bahá&#8217;í Faith</a></span><b>, </b>which is the country&#8217;s second-largest religion after Islam, the  2009 “Green Revolution” and any other subject that came to mine, including drinking alcohol and public dating.</p>
<p>One hilarious conversation this observer had with four early 20’s female students during a Conference last week was about the number (more than 60%) of Chador wearing women who openly wear makeup these days, how Iranian society is changing rapidly, and the amount of hair some women expose while in public and wondering if this was not prohibited by Fatwa and how they deal with it. Their responses were immediate and nearly all at once.  No one had even seen one of the Western hyped “morality police” for a long time and they are few and far between.  One young lady explained that its true she wears her hijab 2/3’s the way back on her head and “if one of those guys dares to say something I will either tell him to mind his own business or if I am in a good mood I will act really, really surprised, shrug my shoulders, wink at him and say something like, “Oh so very sorry, really I am!.  It was a big gust of wind that must have blown it back on my head without me noticing!” Even if there had not even been so much as a soft breeze in days.</p>
<p>Iranian women are smart, strong willed-even a bit pushy at times and naturally alluring. Who would want to join some “morality police” unit?  The ladies explained that if one comes up to you on the street and if you are really rude to him and tell him to get lost, or worse, you might get a ticket and your parents would have to come to the police station and sign a pledge that you would try to do better about trying to observe some modesty in public. Again rather different from what the MSM tells us in the West.</p>
<p>And it’s clear whether attending an international  conference on Hollywoodism (<a href="http://www.hollywoodism.org/" target="_blank">www.hollywoodism.org</a>) at the Azadi (Freedom Hotel-formerly the pre-Revolution Hyatt ), traveling on the Tehran subway (far cleaner than New Yorks!) exploring street souks, visiting the Holy Defense Museum (explaining the 8 years Iran-Iraq war) or  visiting the home of Imam Ruhollah  Khomeini, who led the 1979 Revolution and was Iran’s leader until his death on June 3,1989 in or walking, for miles it seemed, among the nearly two million people marching to Azadi Square to commemorate this month’s 34<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Revolution when the people of Iran overthrew the American agent, Shah Reza Palavi, that the Iranian people are kind and they are gifted.</p>
<p>When I got on the crowded Tehran subway, two young men immediately stood up to offer this observer their seats.  And then we engaged in a very interesting long animated conversation.  Said, Hamzeh, “<i>You know, we feel like we understand America and we should be friends. Both of our countries are culturally unique somehow. Your country evolved from European culture but moved in very distinct direction. In our history Islam arrived via the Arabs but as you have been seeing I am sure, our identity is completely different from Arab countries.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Mahmoud joined in: &#8220;<i>Our society is also made up of many minorities, but we have a single Iranian identity and are very proud of our culture. We&#8217;re also familiar with Western ways. For the last 200 years, we were open to the Western world and influenced by European culture, even if some of the ideas, like democracy, have never had a chance to really develop properly but we will continue trying. But we also know what it&#8217;s like to be a superpower. For us it was a long time ago, but we played an important role in this part of the world for many centuries so we can never see ourselves as subject to western or eastern hegemony.”</i></p>
<p>No experience impressed a group of American visiting Iran, including this one, than the home of Imam Kohmeini and learning from his neighbors and students about the man, scholar and revolutionary. Visiting his home and Hassineyeh which have been kept just as they were the day he died, one neighbor recounted how</p>
<p>Ayatollah’s Khomeini’s wife Khadije Saghafi, who passed away in 2009, told her friends that she had only one wish her whole life that the Imam never granted to her.  And that was that she wished for him to ask her for a glass of water at least once. But he never did. The sweet and gentle husband and father did not want even the wind to visit his family’s faces too harshly or for himself to impose on them.   Another neighbor told us, “When we visited his home we often found the Imam washing the dishes, sweeping the floor, and helping in other household chores.</p>
<p>According to others who knew him well, the Imam led a life of utmost piety and spirituality. In the severe winters of Qom, the he would wake up each night, perform ablution the act of washing oneself for ritual purification) with ice water, and offer his night prayers. His <em>Mafatih </em>(prayer almanac) had to be rebound every few weeks because of how much he used it. Before he began lecturing his students on political activism, he emphasized to them the importance of spirituality and attaining the nearness of Allah.</p>
<p>The simplicity of life style and the modesty of Iran’s revolutionary, Imam Khomeini leader has universal appeal including American ideals.</p>
<p>There is every reason for Washington’s new administration to reach out to Iran, not just with words but with actions.  The American and Iranian people fervently want this and it wills inestimably benefit both societies. The solution to positive the current straightened Iran-US relations includes contact, visitations, discussions and more discussions and from this both peoples can pressure their governments to leave the past behind and develop bonds of friendship.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Iran-Sanctions-grocery3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Iran-Sanctions-grocery2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>While the United States and European Union are vehemently competing with each other in the seemingly endless race of imposing sanctions on Iran, the ordinary Iranian citizens are experiencing the most breathtaking, agonizing impacts of the crippling embargoes.</p>
<p>On July 31, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) <a href="http://www.councilforthenationalinterest.org/news/israellobby/item/1851-aipac-pushes-bill-that-will-establish-virtual-state-of-war-with-iran">sent a letter</a> to all members of the U.S. Congress, demanding a concerted action to approve The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act which imposes a new set of sanctions on Iran&#8217;s energy and transportation sector. </p>
<p>On August 1, the media reported that the Congress has ratified the bill and it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1905">waiting</a> to be signed by the president. </p>
<p>Iran is already under 6 rounds of sanctions endorsed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran">United Nations Security Council</a>. The sanctions are purportedly aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>The UNSC sanctions stipulate a freezing of Iran&#8217;s international assets, the closure of branches of Iranian banks in other countries, barring the export of nuclear and military facilities to Iran, a ban on investment in Iran&#8217;s oil, gas and Petrochemistry sector, business dealings with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, banking and insurance transactions and traveling restrictions for high-ranking governmental and military officials. </p>
<p>The United States, Israel and EU countries have long accused Iran of trying to build nuclear bombs, a charge which Iran has persistently and categorically denied. Iran says that it needs civilian nuclear power to meet its growing energy needs, especially since Iran is a country mostly reliant on fossil fuels for its energy demands and oil revenues to keep its economy alive. The United States and its allies, in response, have penalized Iran with excruciating economic sanctions to derail the possible chances of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons capability.</p>
<p>On January 23, 2012, the European Union foreign ministers agreed upon imposing a multilateral oil embargo against Iran. The oil embargo which bans the European countries from buying crude from Iran went <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303649504577496463851879258.html">into effect</a> on July 1.</p>
<p>What the Western officials say in public is that the sanctions are aimed at punishing the Iranian government and dissuading it from working toward acquiring nuclear weapons. What takes place in reality, however, is that the &#8220;smart&#8221; sanctions have directly come down like a ton of bricks on the Iranian people, making their life an arduous odyssey of struggling for survival in an ailing economy.</p>
<p>The sanctions have devastated the daily life of ordinary Iranian people by bringing the price of goods to a skyrocketing height, making the students abroad unable to get financial assistance from their parents in Iran, rendering it impossible for the private companies to do international transactions and making it extremely difficult for Iranians to get visa for traveling to foreign countries. The &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204251404574342922895240380.html">smart sanctions</a>&#8221; even include a ban on the importing of medicine and foodstuff from the other nations to Iran. </p>
<p>In the previous weeks, I have been arguing with my editors in some of the American political journals to convince them that certain sensitive medicines as well as agricultural goods could not make their way to Iran as a result of sanctions. They wouldn&#8217;t accept, telling me that such transactions were smoothly taking place. But now, I think they have credible evidence available, confirming that the hard-hitting sanctions are destroying the daily life of the poor, defenseless Iranians who should pay the price for the West&#8217;s and Israel&#8217;s animosity with their government. </p>
<p>On May 6, Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/iran_sanctions_medicine_shortages/24571398.html">quoted Iran&#8217;s</a> reformist daily Shargh as writing that the exportation of a great deal of vital medicines to Iran has been banned as a result of the sanctions. These medicines which Iran is not capable of producing include drugs for the treatment of cancer, heart and breathing problems, thalassemia, and multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Hamid Reza Emadi, an Iran-based political commentator also confirms that the latest round of sanctions imposed on Iran just a few days ago directly affect the lives of average Iranians who have nothing to do with the country&#8217;s nuclear program. &#8220;This latest move by the U.S. Congress shows the extent to which Washington has become frustrated and now it is going to step up their pressure on Iranian civilians by preventing the country from importing agricultural products… Iran is a grain importer and the U.S. knows that and by creating obstacles in the way of grain exports to Iran, the U.S. is clearly committing crimes against humanity because it only affects ordinary Iranians who have got nothing to do with the country’s nuclear energy program,&#8221; Emadi said in an <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/08/02/254115/us-bans-on-iran-act-of-frustration/">interview</a> with Press TV.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not forget that it is not just agricultural products; the U.S. is putting maximum pressure on international banks doing business with Iran, therefore Iranian medical companies cannot import some vital medicines,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>The board of directors of the Iranian Hemophilia Society has informed the World Federation of Hemophilia that the lives of tens of thousands of children are being endangered by the lack of proper drugs, a consequence of international economic sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>Dr. Ron Paul, a Texas Congressman has called the recent sanctions an &#8220;<a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/08/02/254134/paul-act-of-war-on-iran-us-obsession/">act of war</a>,&#8221; saying that the bill had better be named &#8220;Obsession with Iran Act 2012.&#8221; </p>
<p>“When you put on sanctions on a country, it’s an act of war and that’s what this is all about,” he said.</p>
<p>Some anti-war advocacy groups and organizations in the United States such as Veterans for Peace and Friends Committee on National Legislation have called on the U.S. government to put an end to its sanctions game with Iran which is seen by these groups a total declaration of war against Iran; however, it seems that these pro-peace groups will face a tough job to have their voice heard by the U.S. Congressmen and people in the White House who seem to be hell bent on delivering a lethal blow to Iran.</p>
<p>&#8220;Veterans for Peace&#8221; has just released a <a href="http://www.veteransforpeace.org/pressroom/news/2012/07/26/statement-of-veterans-for-peace-the-solution-to-the-nuclear-crisis-with-iran-is-not-sanctions-and-war,-it-is-a-middle-east-free-of-all-nuclear-weapons">statement</a>, saying that sanctions and threats of military strike are not viable and logical solutions to the nuclear crisis with Iran. </p>
<p>&#8220;The United States, European Union and Israel are using Iran&#8217;s civilian nuclear program as an excuse to impose devastating economic sanctions against the people of Iran. According to various sources, the sanctions have already wreaked havoc on the Iranian economy, leading to inflation rates of 50 to 100 percent, youth unemployment rate of over 22 percent, drastic reduction of Iran&#8217;s domestic production to 40 percent of its capacity, massive closure of economic enterprises and widespread layoffs, and 40 percent drop in the Iranian oil exports during 2012, resulting in a loss of $32 billion in oil income since last year alone,&#8221; the statement reads. </p>
<p>The group has called for a nuclear free Middle East in an apparent allusion to Israel&#8217;s nuclear arsenal. Along with India and Pakistan, Israel is the only country in the world which is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. By the late 1990s the U.S. Intelligence Community <a href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/">estimated</a> that Israel possessed between 75-130 weapons, based on production estimates. </p>
<p>When all&#8217;s said and done, Iran is currently experiencing difficult times, and its people are under mounting pressure in their daily affairs. Iran&#8217;s economy is on the brink of bankruptcy as a result of the biting economic sanctions and the international community is calmly and silently witnessing the painful suffering of the Iranian people. The anti-Iranian sanctions clearly run counter to the principles of human rights, but it seems that those who advocate such values don&#8217;t believe that Iranians are also &#8220;humans&#8221; who might perchance have some &#8220;rights&#8221; including the right of access to medicine, foodstuff, employment and above all, respect and human dignity.</p>

				<p>July 14, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=15225#respond" title="Comment on Elite Killers Kill At Large For Kidon, Mossad"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="15225 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=15225">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/kidon-mossad3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/kidon-mossad2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>A new book reveals that a department known as Kidon within the Mossad has dispatched assassins into Iran in order to murder the nuclear scientists, thereby stunting the country’s nuclear energy program.</p>
<p>Authors Dan Raviv and Yossi Melman in their book Spies against Armageddon: Inside Israel&#8217;s Secret Wars state that the notorious spy agency has killed at least four Iranian nuclear scientists, including targeting them with operatives on motorcycles, an assassination technique used by the elite killers at Kidon.</p>
<p>The Kidon killers &#8220;excel at accurate shooting at any speed and staying steady to shoot and to place exquisitely shaped sticky bombs&#8221; and consider it their hallmark.</p>
<p>Kidon, known to be one of the world&#8217;s most efficient killing machines, is technically described as a little Mossad within Mossad.</p>
<p>Tasked with carrying out covert ops across the world, Kidon has embarked on a number of black ops and assassinations in different countries.</p>
<p>Those who kill for Kidon are selected either from within the Mossad spy agency or from among the natives of the countries where they plan to carry out assassinations.</p>
<p>For instance, in case of the nuclear assassinations conducted in Iran by Kidon, they basically hired people with Iranian or dual nationalities. One of the Mossad assassins was Majid Jamali Fashi who confessed he had cooperated with Mossad for financial reasons only.</p>
<p>Majid Jamali Fashi assassinated Massoud Ali-Mohammadi, a professor at Tehran University in January 2011 by blowing an explosive-laden motorbike via a remote-controlled device. He reportedly received training from Mossad inside Israel as well as $120,000 to assassinate the Iranian scientist. According to his confession, Jamali Fashi received forged documents in Azerbaijan’s Heydar Aliyev Airport to travel to Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>He confessed, “I woke up early in the morning and as we were trained I went to the warehouse. I had to prepare the box which contained the bomb. I took the motorbike out of the house and reached a location that I had to contact them. I went to the alley [where the professor resided]. It was vacant. No one was there. I brought the bike to the sidewalk and parked it in front of the house. They told me that the mission had been accomplished and that I had to discard my stuff.”</p>
<p>Jamali Fashi was executed under the Iranian judicial system on 15 May, 2012. Parenthetically, Azerbaijan has in recent years become an apparent haven for Mossad spies and assassins.</p>
<p>Another Mossad operative of Iranian nationality has been identified as Ja’far Khoshzaban, alias Javidan, who has been working under the auspices of Azeri security forces and who has been involved in nuclear assassinations. Iranian intelligence ministry has demanded the extradition of Mossad’s Iranian spy from Azerbaijan. Iran has reportedly obtained documents, suggesting that Azeri officials have aided and abetted Mossad and CIA agents in their targeted killings of Iranian nuclear scientists, namely Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan. As a matter of fact, CIA is constantly mentioned along with Mossad as the main elements in the nuclear assassinations.</p>
<p>Ahmadi Roshan was assassinated on January 11, 2012 when an unknown motorcyclist attached a magnetic bomb to his car near a college building of Allameh Tabatabaei University in northern Tehran.</p>
<p>Using the same ‘sticking bomb technique’, the Kidon assassins attached bombs to the vehicles of Iranian university professors Majid Shahriari and Fereydoun Abbasi and detonated the explosives on November 29, 2010. Professor Shahriari was killed immediately, but Dr. Abbasi and his wife only sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>As a rule, the Kidon kill team is comprised of four highly seasoned men: 1. Tracer 2. Transporter 3. Helper 4. Killer.  The tracer spots the target. The transporter guides the assassination team to the target. The helper basically serves as the motorcycle driver who helps the killer and the killer is tasked with shooting the target or attaching magnetic bomb to the car of the victim.</p>
<p>According to the book Spies against Armageddon, the Kidon agents are well-trained in shooting and placing “exquisitely shaped sticky bombs&#8221; and consider it their hallmark.</p>
<p>These facts aside, it rather seems sort of naïve to disregard the role of the CIA-backed MKO terrorists in the nuclear assassinations and give all the credit to the Kidon agents. There is solid evidence which evinces the MKO role in the assassination of the Iranian scientists.</p>
<p>American commentator <a href="http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/2012/03/08/dershowitz-from-israel-firster-to-mek-firster/">Richard Silverstein</a> believes that the primary source of income for the terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) comes from the assassinations the group conducts within the Iranian soil at the behest of the Mossad. He argues that “If you’re a terrorist on behalf of Israel, as MKO is, then you’re kosher as far as (US-based Israeli publicist) Dershowitz is concerned. And your money is golden. Where does the money come from? Possibly from the Iran assassinations the MKO performs on Mossad’s behalf, which undoubtedly pay well. Then there’s the possibility that the USD 400-million Bush allocated for destabilizing Iran in 2007 has found its way either to the MKO or Mossad (or both)”</p>
<p>More to the point, the CIA works in the same satanic league with the Mossad and MKO. Time and again, the officials in Washington have encouraged and even confessed to the killings of the Iranian nuclear scientists.</p>
<p>Former US senator Rick Santorum callously described the assassination of Iranian scientists as “wonderful,” threatening that those who work for Iran&#8217;s nuclear program “are not safe.”</p>
<p>&#8220;On occasion, scientists working on the nuclear program in Iran turn up dead. I think that&#8217;s a wonderful thing, candidly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said, &#8220;I think we should send a very clear message that if you are a scientist from Russia, North Korea, or from Iran and you are going to work on a nuclear program to develop a bomb for Iran, you are not safe.”</p>
<p>Also, former Bush administration ambassador to the UN John Bolton said on Fox News that the killing of an Iranian scientist and sanctions against Iran constitute only “half-measures in the quest to stunt Iran’s nuclear ambitions”.</p>
<p>Former White House Speaker Newt Gingrich has called for covert action, including &#8220;taking out their scientists&#8221; and cyberwarfare.</p>
<p>Quotations of this nature are legion and all these facts reinforce the idea that Washington has been making clandestine efforts to sabotage Iran’s nuclear energy program in cahoots with Tel Aviv and their lackey i.e. the MKO.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/putinnetisrael3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/putinnetisrael2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Two interpretations by the participants themselves, of what significant international meetings achieved, the first on 6/25/12 and the second five days later, remind us about subjectivity in the eyes of the beholders.</p>
<p>Post-event statements, whether following last weekend’s Geneva meeting on Syria which produced markedly different interpretations of the final communiqué language by the Russian and American Foreign Ministers, Sergei Lavrov (that Syria’s President Bashar Assad need not necessarily depart-depending on what the Syrian people decide) and Hillary Clinton, (Assad’s departure is absolutely required) may have sent French, Russian and English language interpreters looking for their thesaurus. </p>
<p>Similarly, vastly divergent Russian-Israeli interpretations about what was agreed to during the 24 hour “ just passing through” visit by  Vladimir Putin to Palestine and  the Zionist lobby’s touting of “ a new Israel-Russia bi-lateral alliance”  suggests serious wishful thinking by one side according to an official at the Russian Embassy in Beirut with whom this observer discussed last week’s Putin visit.</p>
<p>At a joint news conference after their meeting, Mr. Netanyahu said he and Mr. Putin had agreed that the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran “presents a grave danger first of all to Israel, and to the region and the world as a whole.” Israel, Netanyahu announced on 6/25/12, to raised eyebrows from some among the 400 member visiting Russian delegation, expects the once and likely future superpower to support expanded sanctions against Tehran, demand a halt to all uranium enrichment by Iran, insist on the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran and the dismantling of an underground nuclear facility near the city of Qum.</p>
<p>For Putin’s part, he only proffered that he and Netanyahu had discussed Syria and the Iranian nuclear program and that the talks had been “useful”.  During his short visit Putin inaugurated a memorial in Netanya for Soviet troops killed in World War II and presumably had others motives given Russia’s interest in Israel’s defense industry.  In the last two years Russia has purchased 12 drones from different Israeli companies.</p>
<p>The newly inaugurated Russian president, who has said he regarded the breakup of the Soviet Union as a geopolitical catastrophe, defended the Iranian people’s right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes but pointed out at the same time that Iran should guarantee non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but in any case, the problem should be solved peacefully, by way of talks.</p>
<p>Israel’s Prime Minister repeatedly expressed reservations about Russia’s role in the long-stagnant Israeli-Palestinian “peace process”. He complained to Putin that Russia, a member of the so-called quartet of Middle East peacemakers has consistently sided with the Palestinians during disputes. Netanyahu called on Putin to urge the Palestinians to return to negotiations but received a puzzled look from his guest as if Putin might have been wondering why Israel has not suspended illegal settlements expansion and land confiscations, as the Palestinians and the international community have  demanded for over four decades.  Undaunted, Netanyahu appeared not to notice Putin’s quizzical expression while insisting that he was sure that the Russian visit would improve ties in agriculture, science, technology and space, “among other fields’.</p>
<p>The Israeli Prime Ministers staff explained that the Soviet Union had been hostile to Israel and now relations should improve while Defense Minister Ehud Barak said at an Independence Party meeting that “Russia is a very important world power, a country that played a very important role in Syria’s history in the past few years and that is why it will play a key role in the shaping of post-Assad Syria.” Barak also stressed Russia’s importance in “the international effort vis-à-vis Iran in terms of sanctions and diplomacy and his belief that Putin understood that in dealing with Iran, Israel faces a decision between “bombing or the bomb” and if Israel doesn’t attack, Iran will eventually obtain nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Yet, according to Russian Embassy discussions in Beirut, Putin repeatedly warned Israeli officials that the very existence of Israel was at risk if it attacked Iran and that Israel should not delude itself that Russia will ever sanction an attack on Iran or that Russia will get involved with Israel’s attack in anyway.  Putin emphasized that Israel should think twice before taking any action on Iran and should learn lessons from the United States’ experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“Look what happened to America in Afghanistan and Iraq,” Putin said. “I told Obama also. You don’t need to jump to things too early; you don’t need to act before thinking. In Iraq there is a pro-Iranian government after everything that happened there. You need to think well before doing something you’ll be sorry about.” Putin also told Netanyahu that Russia will recognize a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Several high ranking Bush administration officials, drawing salaries from US taxpayers while serving Israel, and who pushed the US to invade Afghanistan and Iraq are currently attempting the same fate for Iran. Backed by the Zionist lobby, they and the Russians are in agreement that only US incompetence gave both countries to Iran with more quite likely in the pipeline from the Persian Gulf area.</p>
<p>Arab and Islamophobe, Ruthie Blum, former senior editor at the Jerusalem Post, and author of “To Hell in a Handbasket: Carter, Obama, and the ‘Arab Spring’, claims that President Obama and the American taxpayers have betrayed Israel.</p>
<p>Ruthie, writing in the current issue of Israel Hayom explains that “Since the minute that Barack Obama became president of the United States nearly four years ago, it was clear that the Jewish state was being tossed aside like an unappreciated, loyal, long-time wife for a far more alluring, utterly inappropriate, and dangerous lover. Indeed, Obama has not hidden the hots he has always had for the Islamic world; nor has he been the least bit discreet about his attraction to its more anti-Western elements. It is the height of tragic irony that, in the absence of its previous protection by its adulterous spouse, America, the Israeli government has nowhere to turn but to Russia.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s staff, which sent her piece to US Zionist lobby outfits, reportedly sees, as their boss does, Israel’s very existence at stake, and he’s prepared for Israel to go it alone or link with Russia because he’s “unwilling to entrust the survival of the Jewish state to America.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during a talk-show when Ruthie finally gave him a chance to get a word in edgewise, Israeli journalist and TV show host, Dan Margalit, announced that: “In a time when the Arab-Left-anti-Semitic axis is doing its utmost to delegitimize and marginalize Israel, Putin’s visit has the power to counter dozens of evil-hearted artists and musicians who boycott Israel. If such visits were the norm, Israel would have laid the red carpet at Ben-Gurion International Airport and welcomed U.S. President Barack Obama by now, but he is understandably not trusted here while Romney is plus if Mitt is elected President he promised his first trip will be to Israel. Obama has never come once since he became President.”</p>
<p>The Obama administration, but not apparently the Congress, was taken aback and issued a statement from Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman: “Governor Romney has said he would do the opposite of what President Obama has done in our relations with Israel. Now he must specify how — does that mean he would reverse President Obama’s policies of sending Israel the largest security assistance packages in history? Does it mean he would let Israel stand alone at the United Nations, or that he would stop funding the Iron Dome system? Does it mean he would abandon the coalition working together to confront Iran’s nuclear ambitions?”</p>
<p>Netanyahu advisor Benny Goldberg explained Israel’s seemingly awkward overtures to Russia as realpolitik. “Look, it’s like the coming Mitt Romney visit.  We will welcome him as we well as Obama if he decides to visit.  After all, in the US Congress we seek support from both sides of the aisle so it’s logical that we want the same relationship with Moscow as we have with Washington.”</p>
<p>So much for the Obama administration’s fantasy of the US-Israel special, one of a kind devoted, legendary, eternal, rock solid, unbreakable, forever and ever iron-clad bond and indivisible alliance which gives America a reliable, democratic strategic Gemini-twins like partnership with America and her very generous, if uninformed, taxpayers.</p>
<p> Some cynical Congressional staffers have commented that Israel already has the US government in its back pocket and that Congress will guarantee that it remains so; therefore Israel has nothing to lose by intimating to the Russians that will discard the US at least to the extent of promoting Russian interests in the region.  After all, as is well known in the White House, Israel sold to the USSR, through a third party, stolen top secret specialized code-word compartmented (TS/SCI) intelligence via Jonathan Pollard, which from his KGB tenure Putin presumably  has direct knowledge of.”</p>
<p>Goldberg also explained recently that in the past it was only logic that dictated switching Israeli acceptance of the “keeping the Golan Heights quiet Alawi Shia regime in Syria” which at the time made sense given the concomitant danger from Sunni Islamists, including the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. But now Israel has switched its support for a Sunni regime in Syria that it hopes will confront Iran and Hezbollah.  Realpolitik also dictates that if the Sunnis fail to topple Assad Israel can live with that also because it believes that Israel’s annexation of the Golan will not be challenged with more than words.</p>
<p>There is little conflict between Russia’s and Israel’s interests because neither country is as powerful as it would like to be in the region. Russia has few of the options it had during the Cold War and Israel has little influence in the outcome in Syria or in Egypt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Russia and Israel do have some complementary interests. One example is Azerbaijan where Russian is a major weapons provider for the regime and the Israelis are also selling it large amounts of weapons.  The CIA suspects it has set up a base from which to spy on, and, according to rumors, prepare to attack Iran. Apparently Russia does not feel threatened by Israeli involvement in Azerbaijan or that both are there, and each operate in ways that would appear to be in conflict but don’t, according to Stratford’s George Freeman.</p>
<p>There are also some bilateral interests on an economic and a strategic level, because Russia is looking for new partners in the area.</p>
<p>In addition, both Russia and Israel have benefited enormously from U.S. “terrorism wars” in the Islamic world. It is not just that these wars alienate Muslims, which is beneficial to Israel, but they also help the Russians due to the debilitating human and economic cost for America.</p>
<p>As the US staggers, and with Russia and China practicing shrewd Middle East politics, one imagines that Israeli leaders might be recalling the days and reasons that the Zionist colonial enterprise dumped England for America following World War II.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/us-iran-diplomacy-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/us-iran-diplomacy-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>While Iran and the world six powers wrapped up their talks on Thursday in an atmosphere apparently meant to resolve the nuclear issue, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs and top negotiator on Iran Wendy Sherman rushed to Tel Aviv to brief  Israeli officials on the new nuclear developments and &#8220;reaffirm our [US] unshakeable commitment to Israel&#8217;s security.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report she delivered to Israeli National Security Adviser Yaakov Amidror and Foreign Ministry Director-General Rafi Barak however turned out to be much to the discontent of the Israelis. According to her report, no progress had been achieved in Baghdad on account of Iran’s refusal to nudge on its inalienable “right” to enrich uranium at low (3.5-5 percent) or high (20 percent) levels or shut down the Fordow site near the city of Qom.</p>
<p>So overpowering and biting was the feeling of anger in the Zionist officials that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak declined to receive the top negotiator on Iran for reasons clearly discernible to the mortified US negotiator and to Washington as well.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the US government is divided over the Iran case: some US officials are in favor of resolving the nuclear dispute over Iran with the full knowledge that there is no diversion towards military use in the country’s nuclear program on the strength of the reports provided by the intelligence agencies in the US: this group is held in extreme Zionist contempt. Yet, a second group constitutes those who are at the becks and calls of the Zionists, politicize the Iranian nuclear energy program and make every financial, political and security effort to safeguard the interests of the Zionist regime i.e. downgrading or even violating Iran’s inalienable right to the civilian use of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Although European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton looked at the bright side of the Baghdad talks, said the two sides found &#8220;some common ground&#8221; and the two sides even agreed to more talks in Moscow on June 18 and 19, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton downplayed the nuclear talks and said &#8220;significant differences&#8221; still remain over Iran&#8217;s nuclear program:</p>
<p>&#8220;As we lay the groundwork for these talks, we will keep up the pressure as part of our dual-track approach. All of our sanctions will remain in place and will continue to move forward during this period. Iran now has the choice to make: will it meet its international obligations and give the world confidence in its intentions or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Apart from the threatening tone of Mrs. Clinton’s remarks that “All of our sanctions will remain in place,” one can clearly see that Washington’s policies are but shrouded in a thick veil of ambiguities and double standards regarding Iran.</p>
<p>Also, in these very words lie some ingratiating suggestions to the Zionists that Washington will not give up its leverage of pressure on Iran as an effective measure and that it will constantly adhere to its unshakeable commitment to Israel under all circumstances and no matter how hard Tehran tries to cast aside the US-manufactured doubts and fears concerning Iran nuclear energy program, Washington will never relinquish its Zionist-friendly anti-Iran policies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these words convey the impression that Washington is under the diabolical spell of the Zionists and that every step they take is in fact weighed and decided by the Zionist lobby within the US ruling system and as the Persian saying goes, they are not even allowed to drink water without their [Zionists] permission.</p>
<p>The new report released by the UN atomic energy agency on Iran nuclear activities indicates that Iran is following a civilian nuclear program.</p>
<p>However, a new glitch happened in one of the Fordow centrifuges which accidently over-enriched the uranium being processed to the level of 27 percent. The glitch was later clarified on Saturday by Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran&#8217;s envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency, who said, “As mentioned in the IAEA report, the issue is a normal technical glitch which is being investigated by experts.” He also said “minor technical glitches” of this nature are also found in the nuclear facilities of other countries.</p>
<p>Even intelligence agencies have recently testified that Iran is not pursuing to build a nuclear bomb. According to an article carried by the Los Angeles Times on February 23, 2012, a most recent report, representing the consensus of 16 US intelligence agencies, indicates that “Iran is pursuing research that could put it in a position to build a weapon, but that it has not sought to do so.”</p>
<p>Echoing the “highly classified” assessment by 16 US intelligence agencies, Israel’s Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Benny Gantz said he does not believe Iran will pursue nuclear weapons after years of efforts made by Tel Aviv and its allies to convince the world otherwise. Gantz described Iran&#8217;s leadership as “very rational” who would not  make such a decision. His remarks, which greatly angered  Israeli officials, were later repeated by intelligence and military officials in Israel, indicating a marked rift between the government and the military.</p>
<p>Despite all evidence pointing with full force to the peaceful nature of Iran&#8217;s nuclear program, there are desperate efforts by the Zionists to reflect the reality in a distorting mirror, depict Iran as a nuclear threat, and make its lapdogs in Washington slap more sanctions on the country.</p>
<p>As long as Israel breathes down Washington’s neck, there is little hope the nuclear dispute will be resolved once and for all; and the future talks will eventually enter into infinite loop conditions.</p>

			<p>For the past few weeks, word of the extent of the Fukushima disaster is spreading like the radiation slick moving across the Pacific Ocean thanks to social media and a lot of newly concerned citizens.</p>
<p>Independent researchers who have been trying to warn people for over a year are finally being heard. Much of that can be attributed to citizen journalists, who have realized mainstream media dropped the ball on this a long time ago.</p>
<p>To understand the dynamics of information and how it has been controlled, you would have to look at companies like General Electric and Westinghouse, who not only build nuclear reactors, but own major news outlets and, of course, are buddy-buddy with the Obama Administration.</p>
<p>Or, I can just tell you about it, since I have spent countless hours researching these connections and interviewing people about it. More on that at a later date. It deserves a nice big page in itself, with room for lots of details.</p>
<p>Not only do we have citizen journalists and the alternative media on top of this, but citizen scientists as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAVSRALX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="imagesCAVSRALX" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAVSRALX.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="149" /></a>Have you met your new Fukushima expert, who just might live right next door? These are people who have taught themselves everything they possibly could about nuclear physics, radiation, Geiger counters, atomic power, nuclear plants, the effects of radiation on health, and <a href="http://fukushimafacts.com/Default.aspx?PID=47&amp;T=Mitigation%20&amp;%20How%20To%20Protect%20Yourself" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">radiation mitigation</a>.</p>
<p>These citizen scientists have studied bombs, fallout, and weather and wind patterns. They have been monitoring radiation levels across the country, with their own equipment they purchased out of pocket and learned how to use.</p>
<p>They have read anything and everything they can get their hands on. They know the difference between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, and how to avoid it.</p>
<p>They know that besides cancer, radiation can do all kinds of things to you, like severely compromise your immune system, intelligence, and thyroid, or make you aggressive, confused, and fatigued.</p>
<p>You might bruise or bleed in weird places and feel sick more than usual. They have learned all this out of their own instincts of survival.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mk_6_nuclear_bomb.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="mk_6_nuclear_bomb" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mk_6_nuclear_bomb-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="181" /></a>Sometimes they even go 2 days without sleep, when bad stuff is happening, just to make sure they are keeping on top of the issues as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s amazing what you can do in a short period of time when your life depends on it. And the more that they learn, the greater their sense of urgency has become in bringing this info to the masses.</p>
<p>And what conclusion have these citizen journalists and citizen scientists reached throughout 14 months of study?</p>
<p>They have come to the inevitable conclusion that all of our lives changed on March 11, 2011, when Fukushima went out of control.</p>
<p>The glaring problem is that we that we weren’t told about what actually happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs_1000lb_5in.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="bombs_1000lb_5in" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs_1000lb_5in-300x245.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="196" /></a>Take, for instance, the fact that there were 3 meltdowns almost right away, and that the radioactive isotopes that blew all over Japan, Hawaii, Alaska, Canada and North America came in extraordinarily high quantities.</p>
<p>Or how various agencies that taxpayers have funded, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), did not do their job which is to protect the environment, and us.</p>
<p>In fact the EPA turned off their monitors for about a month, for the first time in their history. These are expensive and delicate pieces of equipment the taxpayers had already bought and paid for, for just such an emergency.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) knew, but they hid the information. The Obama Administration knew, but sent Hillary Clinton over to Japan to shake hands with the Prime Minister and show support.</p>
<p>Obama came out with a statement to the American people, saying, “We do not believe harmful levels of radiation will reach our shores,” which we now know was a lie.</p>
<p>We had to figure all this out for ourselves, which was difficult because the information was purposely withheld from us.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, they can’t stop the truth from leaking out of Fukushima. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have now proven this beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theory is becoming conspiracy fact. And now we are going public with this information, and in a very big way.</p>
<p>It has been around 3 weeks since I wrote <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/04/21/fukushima-is-falling-apart-are-you-ready/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">my first article</a> for <a href="http://endthelie.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">End the Lie</a>, and still no real progress to report at the plant itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B5390716-Fasciation-SPL.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="Fasciation" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B5390716-Fasciation-SPL-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="243" /></a>Tons of water continues to get poured into the reactors and flow subsequently into the Pacific Ocean, every second of every day.</p>
<p>Radiation continues to steam itself out of the ground, and thus up into the air, which then blows over us (i.e. resident of the northern hemisphere).</p>
<p>Earthquakes still happen daily around Japan. In fact there were 7 or 8 of them just in the past few days near Fukushima.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/05/06/which-will-collapse-first-the-economy-or-the-spent-fuel-pool-at-fukushima/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spent fuel still sits in its shaky nest at the top of reactor number 4</a>. Nothing has been done to further reinforce the structure.</p>
<p>The good news (if you can really call it that) is that it hasn’t fallen yet. The United Nations and the United States are now in their most preliminary stages of addressing the complexity of problems there, in an attempt to see if they can help out.</p>
<p>But as you know, the wheels of bureaucracy turn very slowly. It took almost 14 months for them to start turning at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/smiley-nuclear.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="smiley-nuclear" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/smiley-nuclear-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="185" /></a>Besides the ongoing releases into the ocean and air and the precariousness of the pool, we have a debris field the size of Texas starting to hit the west coast and Alaska, which may or may not be radioactive.</p>
<p>Japan has been burning radioactive trash, and will continue to do so until at least 2014, and that blows over us as well.</p>
<p>We have a radioactive slick moving across the ocean, which by all estimates should have sunk to the bottom, but hasn’t. And we have sick and dying mammals, fish, and birds all over the world, which may or may not be related, but should still be an enormous concern, since many of them are being found in the Pacific.</p>
<p>That is part of the problem when you are faced with the world’s largest disaster. All of the models for how to deal with it can be thrown out the window.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/radiation-umbrella.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="radiation-umbrella" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/radiation-umbrella-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="191" /></a>All the assumptions about fallout and it working itself into the food chain have been wrong. It was much worse, and has happened much faster, than anyone expected, even for concerned citizens and independent researchers following this closely.</p>
<p>The government knew this would be the case from the early SPEEDI numbers, which were hand translated and delivered to the US government as they happened. But for the most part, Fukushima has exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p>
<p>New ideas, new techniques, and new engineering has to be invented and implemented. New observations have to be made, and they are, as can be seen by searching “mutations” on YouTube and watching some videos.</p>
<p>We have citizen journalists and citizen scientists who are desperately trying to come up with solutions, and are doing it for free, while our government and agencies created to “protect us” continue to collect their paycheck, roll their eyes, shove their hands in their pockets and hum a tune like they’re waiting for a taxi.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/page11_obama_nuclear.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="page11_obama_nuclear" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/page11_obama_nuclear-300x249.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="224" /></a>But out of crisis, comes opportunity. I’ll use 9/11 again as an example.</p>
<p>Why do people get a warm fuzzy feeling when we see people rushing to aid those in the midst of disaster? Because we humans are hard-wired to care for others, and long to be part of a community.</p>
<p>Out of disaster, there is camaraderie, sympathy, and empathy. There are important lessons to be learned.</p>
<p>There are whole new industries that could be created out of this crisis, putting people to work. Aquaponics. Decontamination. Mitigation. Food testing.</p>
<p>And since we didn’t seem to learn these lessons with Chernobyl, we need to learn them right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs-away.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="bombs-away" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs-away-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" /></a>All nuclear power does is boil water and create steam, which turbines turn into electricity. But when something goes wrong, it has the ability to kill everything on the planet. That is where we are at now.</p>
<p>We need to adapt if we are to survive. And part of that adaptation means we need to eliminate the possibility of this ever happening again, starting with the 23 reactors the same style as Fukushima, in the United States, which is the Mark 1 Boiling Water Reactor, or BWR.</p>
<p>People in the industry jokingly refer to these as “double-decker beach-bombs,” for the reason that the spent fuel is located in pools at the top of the reactor buildings, and they are usually located at a water source for emergency cooling purposes for when the fecal matter hits the fan at one of these plants.</p>
<p>In fact, several nuclear engineers who designed these reactors quit in protest before they went into production. They realized they had made a mistake. They realized this design would be extremely dangerous. GE went ahead and built them anyway.</p>
<p>When is the world going to realize the mistake of embracing nuclear energy as a power source, in spite of its danger?</p>
<p>And how long do we continue to ignore the brilliant scientists that warned about this, like Oppenheimer and Einstein? Or is it already too late?</p>
<div></div>
<p>There are no energy problems, in comparison. If you want to cut down on your electricity usage, turn off your TV.</p>
<p>We have natural gas deposits that could power everything we need. We have the power of the sun, water, wind and earth in the form of geothermal energy.</p>
<p>Nuclear power is a sham, just like the oil industry, and we have been duped into believing we need it to survive.</p>
<p>It generates billions and billions of dollars for these corporations. GE (who has the most ironic motto, “We Bring Good Things to Life”) made 14 billion dollars last year, and paid no taxes.</p>
<p>In addition to producing electricity, nuclear reactors also generate 500 pounds of plutonium a year per reactor, as a byproduct of the fission process.</p>
<p>What happens to all that highly toxic plutonium? The government gets to collect this material to make bombs, so we can go utterly decimate other countries, now known as “spreading democracy” and poison their populations for future generations.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget depleted uranium, or DU, which is now used in many military applications with horrific results.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/iraq-war-child.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="iraq-war-child" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/iraq-war-child-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="164" /></a>Check out videos of children in Fallujah for some recent examples of this.</p>
<p>This is the one big secret that the nuke industry and our government will do anything to protect: besides being a billion dollar industry, nuke plants are basically bomb-making factories right under our noses.</p>
<p>Drawing attention to Fukushima would have drawn attention to this function of nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>An added side effect is that they also make people sick and help boost the health care industry, which in some states is now the number one private sector employer.</p>
<p>The plutonium and fission byproducts these plants produce help support our government’s number-one priority: the almighty military-industrial complex.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAQ3GNQ3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="imagesCAQ3GNQ3" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAQ3GNQ3.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="164" /></a>And it’s all in the name of money, power, and control. Energy companies hire top level advertisers and public relations people to promote and manipulate public opinion. Even during the Superbowl, ads were run showing how steam from nuclear power runs the turbines that make beer.</p>
<p>They want you to believe that we are dependent on this source of energy for our quality of life. The truth of the matter, on the other hand, is that nuclear power has ruined our lives.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who used to live in the ever-expanding evacuation zone in Japan, which may soon include the 35 million people in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who lives near a nuke plant and has a child with autism, gastroenteritis, or cancer. Just take a look at the statistics of cancer in the general population since we started embracing this technology.</p>
<p>The truth is: we have been nuked and are still getting nuked, every day, in a very big way.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nuke-parade-small.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="nuke-parade-small" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nuke-parade-small-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="179" /></a>I used to be a huge supporter of nuclear power, but 14 months of intensive study has changed my opinion significantly.</p>
<p>In addition to my studies, I have been influenced by some major health issues I developed after being outside the first 3 weeks after the reactors exploded. During that time I had a metallic-taste in my mouth, which I found out later was from tasting fission products. More on that later as well.</p>
<p>Nuclear cheerleaders like to complicate things in an attempt to make radiation something much harder to understand. That way it turns people off from the subject and they won’t pay attention as much.</p>
<p>The truth is, you don’t need to be a physicist, a scientist, or an expert in this field. You don’t need to know the differences between decay rates and half-lives, or cesium and strontium.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a>You only need to understand one thing: All radiation is bad, and all of it will make you sick, no matter how much Ann Coulter claims that the Japanese should be thankful for Fukushima.</p>
<p>The more you are exposed to it, the sicker you will be. The more places you can cut down on your exposure, the better off your health will be.</p>
<p>Radiation is cumulative. It builds up in the body. It destroys cells. It causes mutations in cell growth which can thus create cancer or other illnesses.</p>
<p>There is plenty of this radiation leaking out of Fukushima for over a year now, blowing around in our air, building up in our soil, and contaminating our water supply.</p>
<p>What’s worse, we have 104 of these plants in the United States, with special emphasis on the 23 previously mentioned, where this exact scenario is waiting to happen.</p>
<div id="attachment_45328"></div>
<p>Radioactive steam comes out of these plants all the time, since as part of their normal operations. They vent to the atmosphere to keep things cool. Do some research into “rainshadow” in autism and brain cancer in children, and look where the numbers are the highest: around nuclear plants.</p>
<p>We can’t afford to wait or delay. If you aren’t already mitigating, you need to start now. You need to treat your health, and the health of your family, like you all have cancer already. That might sound like fear mongering to some, but this is one case where “better safe than sorry” truly applies.</p>
<p>This process involves eating healthy whole foods, filtering water, avoiding precipitation, taking supplements, and getting lots of sleep.</p>
<p>Stop eating fast food, and eat lower on the food chain, where bio-accumulation is less. Stop eating seafood, unless you know it is safe.</p>
<p>Include your children in these changes, because we will be dealing with this problem for at least the rest of our lives, and so will they.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600-213x300.jpg" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a>We have to change our perspective. Quality of life becomes a much more important issue when your life expectancy has been shortened.</p>
<p>We have Fukushima to thank for this, and the nuclear industry, of course. As well as the various other individuals or agencies that tried to keep this information from us.</p>
<p>And then of course we have spent fuel pool doom lurking in the shadows. And for some unknown reason, Tepco seems to think their most immediate concern is building a huge underground wall, to contain something going on under the plant, the extent of which hasn’t yet been shared with us.</p>
<p>So what do they know that we don’t? Why is there a sense of urgency to contain something underground, when the spent fuel pool #4 is supposedly the weakest link in the Fukushima chain?</p>
<p>Where is all this technology we have to look for gas and oil, like ground-penetrating radar, optical coherence tomography, or even HAARP, to see what’s going on under the plants? What else is being hidden from us?</p>
<p>Instead of calling it game over, let’s play a new game called “No More Fukushimas.”</p>
<p>Let’s figure out ways to clean up this mess and not make more of them in the future. We can leave this for our children to deal with, that is if they are still here.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AJ201109069466.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="AJ201109069466" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AJ201109069466-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="179" /></a>Or it is up to you, it is up to me, it is up to <strong>all</strong>of us to fix this situation, right now, as best as we possibly can.</p>
<p>Take care of your family first, have a plan for the worst-case scenario, then do what you can to help others.</p>
<p>Our lives all changed over a year ago, only you weren’t told about it. As bad as things are, there is a huge opportunity here for something wonderful to come out of this mess. A cleaner, brighter, healthier future for our children and generations to come. A future, period.</p>
<p>As a close associate of Obama once said, “Never let a crisis go to waste”. This might be the last crisis that we ever see, if we don’t so something about it.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/tokyo-japan-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/tokyo-japan-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>A new report circulating in the Kremlin today prepared by the <a href="http://www.mid.ru/bdomp/sitemap.nsf" target="_blank">Foreign Ministry</a> on the planned <a href="http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_04_13/71656029/" target="_blank">re-opening of talks</a> with Japan over the disputed Kuril Islands during the next fortnight states that Russian diplomats were “stunned” after being told by their Japanese counterparts that upwards of 40 million of their peoples were in “extreme danger” of life threatening radiation poisoning and could very well likely be faced with forced evacuations away from their countries eastern most located cities… including the world’s largest one, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" target="_blank">Tokyo</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands" target="_blank">Kuril Islands</a> are located in Russia&#8217;s Sakhalin Oblast region and stretch approximately 1,300 km (810 miles) northeast from Hokkaido-, Japan, to Kamchatka, Russia, separating the Sea of Okhotsk from the North Pacific Ocean. There are 56 islands and many more minor rocks. It consists of Greater Kuril Ridge and Lesser Kuril Ridge, all of which were captured by Soviet Forces in the closing days of World War II from the Japanese.</p>
<p>The “extreme danger” facing tens of millions of the Japanese peoples is the result of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster" target="_blank">Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster</a> that was a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami" target="_blank">To-hoku earthquake and tsunami</a>on 11 March 2011.</p>
<p>According to this report, Japanese diplomats have signaled to their Russian counterparts that the returning of the Kuril Islands to Japan is “critical” as they have no other place to resettle so many people that would, in essence, become the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer" target="_blank">largest migration of human beings since the 1930’s</a> when Soviet leader Stalin forced tens of millions to resettle Russia’s far eastern regions.</p>
<p>Important to note, this report continues, are that Japanese diplomats told their Russian counterparts that they were, also, “seriously considering” an offer by China to relocate tens of millions of their citizens to the Chinese mainland to inhabit what are called the “ghost cities,” built for reasons still unknown and described, in part, by London’s Daily Mail News Service in their 18 December 2010 article titled: “<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1339536/Ghost-towns-China-Satellite-images-cities-lying-completely-deserted.html" target="_blank">The Ghost Towns Of China: Amazing Satellite Images Show Cities Meant To Be Home To Millions Lying Deserted</a>” that says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“These amazing satellite images show sprawling cities built in remote parts of China that have been left completely abandoned, sometimes years after their construction. Elaborate public buildings and open spaces are completely unused, with the exception of a few government vehicles near communist authority offices. Some estimates put the number of empty homes at as many as 64 million, with up to 20 new cities being built every year in the country&#8217;s vast swathes of free land.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Foreign Ministry experts in this report note that should Japan accept China’s offer, the combined power of these two Asian peoples would make them the largest super-power in human history with an economy larger than that of the United States and European Union combined and able to field a combined military force of over 200 million.</p>
<p>To how dire the situation is in Japan was recently articulated by Japanese diplomat <a href="http://akiomatsumura.com/" target="_blank">Akio Matsumura</a>who <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/fukushima-reactor-4-life-on-planet-earth-in-the-balance.html" target="_blank">warned</a> that the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant may ultimately turn into an event capable of extinguishing all life on Earth.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/fukushima-reactor-4-life-on-planet-earth-in-the-balance.html" target="_blank">Prison Planet News Service</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Matsumura posted [this] startling entry on his blog following a statement made by Japan’s former ambassador to Switzerland, Mitsuhei Murata, on the situation at Fukushima.</p>
<p>Speaking at a public hearing of the Budgetary Committee of the House of Councilors on 22 March 2012, Murata warned that “if the crippled building of reactor unit 4 – with 1,535 fuel rods in the spent fuel pool 100 feet (30 meters) above the ground – collapses, not only will it cause a shutdown of all six reactors but will also affect the common spent fuel pool containing 6,375 fuel rods, located some 50 meters from reactor 4,” writes Matsumura.</p>
<p>In both cases the radioactive rods are not protected by a containment vessel; dangerously, they are open to the air. This would certainly cause a global catastrophe like we have never before experienced. He stressed that the responsibility of Japan to the rest of the world is immeasurable. Such a catastrophe would affect us all for centuries. Ambassador Murata informed us that the total numbers of the spent fuel rods at the Fukushima Daiichi site excluding the rods in the pressure vessel is 11,421.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Disturbingly, the desperate situation facing Japan is, also, facing the United States as Russian military observers <a href="http://en.ria.ru/mlitary_news/20120408/172680758.html" target="_blank">overflying the US this week</a> as part of the Open Skies Treaty are reporting “unprecedented” amounts of radiation in the Western regions of that country, a finding that was further confirmed by scientists with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute who <a href="http://theintelhub.com/2012/04/12/radioactive-wave-from-japan-headed-towards-united-states-full-of-extremely-high-levels-of-radiation/" target="_blank">have confirmed that a wave of highly radioactive waste is headed directly for the US west coast</a>.</p>
<p>Important to note is that this new wave of Fukushima radiation headed towards the US is in addition to earlier radiation events that American scientists are now blaming for <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/calif-kelp-radioactivity-study.html" target="_blank">radioactive particles from Japan being detected in California kelp</a>.</p>
<p>Though the news of this ongoing global catastrophe is still being heavily censored in the US, the same cannot be said about Japan, and as <a href="http://lewrockwell.com/slavo/slavo102.html" target="_blank">recently reported</a> by the leading Japanese newspaper <a href="http://mainichi.jp/english/english/perspectives/news/20120402p2a00m0na002000c.html" target="_blank">The Mainichi Daily News that reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of the biggest issues that we face is the possibility that the spent nuclear fuel pool of the No. 4 reactor at the stricken Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant will collapse. This is something that experts from both within and outside Japan have pointed out since the massive quake struck. TEPCO, meanwhile, says that the situation is under control. However, not only independent experts, but also sources within the government say that it’s a grave concern.</p>
<p>The storage pool in the No. 4 reactor building has a total of 1,535 fuel rods, or 460 tons of nuclear fuel, in it. The 7-story building itself has suffered great damage, with the storage pool barely intact on the building’s third and fourth floors. The roof has been blown away. If the storage pool breaks and runs dry, the nuclear fuel inside will overheat and explode, causing a massive amount of radioactive substances to spread over a wide area. Both the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and French nuclear energy company Areva have warned about this risk.</p>
<p>A report released in February by the Independent Investigation Commission on the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident stated that the storage pool of the plant’s No. 4 reactor has clearly been shown to be “the weakest link” in the parallel, chain-reaction crises of the nuclear disaster. The worse-case scenario drawn up by the government includes not only the collapse of the No. 4 reactor pool, but the disintegration of spent fuel rods from all the plant’s other reactors. <strong>If this were to happen, residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area would be forced to evacuate.</strong>”</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though this crisis in Japan has been described as “<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=30207" target="_blank">a nuclear war without a war</a>” and the US Military is being reported is now <a href="http://theintelhub.com/2012/04/11/the-us-military-is-stocking-up-on-a-massive-amount-of-anti-radiation-pills-in-preparation-for-nuclear-fallout/" target="_blank">stocking up on massive amounts of anti-radiation pills in preparation for nuclear fallout</a>, there remains no evidence at all the ordinary peoples are being warned about this danger in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p dir="LTR">The fact that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has joined the vicious triangle of the United States, Israel and Britain to destabilize the Islamic Republic of Iran and put pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program is not a secret anymore. The Saudi officials have openly stated their opposition to Iran&#8217;s access to peaceful nuclear energy and even have boastfully promised to make up for the amount of crude oil which the EU member states will be losing after imposing a multilateral oil embargo against Iran which is seen as an effort to force Iran into giving up its nuclear rights.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The Saudis are officially considered to be among the Muslim states which don&#8217;t recognize the Israeli regime; however, they haven&#8217;t hesitated to publicize their ties with the Israeli officials during the recent years, especially when it comes to their cooperation with Tel Aviv againstIran.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Allying with the Zionist regime and betraying a Muslim friend with which it had long maintained sound and reasonable ties can be considered as a manifestation of Saudis&#8217; miscalculations and their erroneous analyses about the position of Iran in the international community; a position which has been bolstered with the unexpectedly massive participation of Iranians in the recent parliamentary elections in early March, showing people&#8217;s solidarity and steadfastness in the face of harsh economic sanctions and paralyzing political pressures.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Recent WikiLeaks reports suggest that Saudi officials have been working closely with the Mossad to step up pressure againstIranand gathering intelligence about the country&#8217;s nuclear program.</p>
<p dir="LTR">In the Stratfor (a Texas-based global intelligence firm) emails leaked by WikiLeaks and obtained by the Beirut-based Al Akhbar newspaper, it was revealed the Saudi Arabia reached out to the Mossad, which assisted the Kingdom with, as Al Akhbar reports, &#8220;intelligence collection and advice on Iran.&#8221;<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="LTR">According to a source quoted in the emails, &#8220;Several enterprising Mossad officers, both past and present, are making a bundle selling the Saudis everything from security equipment, intelligence and consultation.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="LTR">There are also credible reports indicating that Mossad chief  has recently visited Saudi Arabia and talked to Saudi officials about the possible plans for attacking Iran&#8217;s nuclear facilities and the role the Arab nation can play in this dangerous anti-Iranian scenario.</p>
<p dir="LTR">As written by Haaretz, &#8220;the talks conducted in Saudi Arabia with the head of Israel&#8217;s espionage agency dealt with Iran and its nuclear program. The account follows a series of recent reports on increasing secret cooperation between Israel and the Saudis, including defense coordination on matters related to possible military action against Iran&#8217;s nuclear facilities.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="LTR">Another report by the Times of London revealed that in 2010 and during the course of a Saudi military exercise, air defense system operations were halted for a few hours to rehearse a scenario whereby Israeli fighter planes would cross Saudi Arabian air space en route to an attack onIran.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Other independent media reports also confirmed that Israeli air force planes and helicopters have recently landed in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of positioning military equipment there to be used in a possible assault on Iran.  Actually, it&#8217;s one of the plans of  Israeli officials to use the airspace of Saudi Arabia, Iran&#8217;s southwestern neighbor, for launching an attack against the country&#8217;s nuclear installations and seemingly, the Saudis are not reluctant for giving a green light to Tel Aviv in this regard.</p>
<p dir="LTR">In retrospect, the Saudi officials have expressively and explicitly denounced Iran&#8217;s nuclear program and called on the U.S. and its European officials to tighten the noose of economic sanctions around their Muslim neighbor as if they&#8217;re unaware of the fact that several IAEA and NIE reports have confirmed that Iran is not, and has not been after nuclear weapons and has never diverted from the path of using nuclear technology for peaceful ends.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Two years ago, in a joint press conference with his American counterpart, the Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saudi al-Faisal said that economic sanctions cannot guarantee that Iran will retreat from its nuclear program and a more effective solution is needed for the &#8220;threats posed by Iran&#8217;s nuclear ambitions.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="LTR">Al-Faisal described sanctions as a long-term solution and said the perceived threat coming from Iran is more pressing. &#8220;We see the issue in the shorter term because we are closer to the threat. We need immediate resolution rather than gradual resolution,&#8221; he said. The Saudi prince did not specify any short-term resolution, but it seems that his implied option, which he did not rule out, is a military intervention inIran.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The Saudis are also trying to convince the U.S. and Europe that Iran&#8217;s nuclear program poses a threat to their security and should be hindered as soon as possible. That&#8217;s why many U.S. and European officials state in their bilateral meetings with Saudi officials that a &#8220;nuclear-armed Iran&#8221; is harmful to the security of  the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p dir="LTR">&#8220;I understand the Arab world cannot allow that Iran continues to develop nuclear weapons,&#8221; said Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the leader of opposition party in the German parliament and former foreign minister in a February meeting with the Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The Saudi kingdom&#8217;s hostility towards Iran, however, has gone beyond the pale. In the recent months that war rhetoric and economic sanctions against Tehran have been swaying in the sky, the Saudi officials have sent signals that they&#8217;re ready to offset any shortfall that may happen in the crude oil market after the EU member states&#8217; foreign ministers reached an agreement to impose an oil embargo on Iran which will come into effect in early July.</p>
<p dir="LTR">According to an Associated Press report, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s oil minister said on March 14 that his country and other oil exporters are ready to offset any shortfalls in supply because of market volatility, an apparent reference to showdowns with Iran over its nuclear program.</p>
<p dir="LTR">At any rate, the stance which Riyadh has adopted against Tehran is absolutely in line with the anti-Iranian policies of the Israeli regime. They&#8217;re dancing to Israel&#8217;s tune and performing what Tel Aviv desires the most: isolating Iran, ramping up pressure against the people and creating discord between them to persuade them to rise against the government. However, what is clear is that such pressures cannot bring Iranians to their knees and will only unveil the true face of the enemies of this nation. Over the course of three decades since the victory of Islamic revolution, Iran has been constantly the target of enmity and belligerence by the global superpowers and their allies, so the recent antagonistic policies and hostilities of Saudi Arabia are nothing new or surprising.</p>

<div>
<p>The mainstream media and the federal government will soon have the blood of the world on it’s hands.</p>
<p>Radiation from the Fukushima Nuclear Plant disaster in Japan is now actively in the ecosystem all along the North American west coast… even the sea weed is now radiated.  The <a href="http://enenews.com/vancouver-seaweed-almost-400-above-international-standard-for-iodine-131-in-food-by-march-28-levels-increasing" target="_blank">Vancouver Sun</a> reported one year ago that the seaweed tested from waters off the coast of British Columbia were 4 times the amount considered safe.  No further test results were released after the initial report.</p>
<p>The governments of the United States and Canada are not conducting tests for radioactivity – at least not to the knowledge of the public.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has agreed to continue purchasing seafood from Japan, despite the fact that the food is not being tested for radioactive contamination.  Last November, independent testing in Japan showed 65 per cent of the catches tested positive for cesium (a radioactive material).  Instead of refusing to purchase the poisoned fish, food safety agencies in both the United States and Canada have simply raised the “acceptable level of radiation.”  We can’t go offending the Japanese after promising to buy their tainted goods, now can we?</p>
<p>After the North American governments refused to fund testing, oceanographer Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist at the non-profit Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass, along with Nicholas Fisher, a marine sciences professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and other concerned scientists, managed to secure private funding for a Pacific research voyage.  The results?</p>
<blockquote><p>Cesium levels in the Pacific had initially gone up an astonishing 45 million times above pre-accident levels. The levels then declined rapidly for a while, but after that, they unexpectedly levelled off.</p>
<p>In July, cesium levels stopped declining and remained stuck at 10,000 times above pre-accident levels.</p>
<p>This means the ocean isn’t diluting the radiation as expected. If it had been, cesium levels would have kept falling.</p>
<p>The finding suggests that radiation is still being released into the ocean long after the accident in March, 2011.</p></blockquote>
<p>Less than two weeks after the tsunami and subsequent nuclear disaster, Michael Kane, an investigative journalist, <a href="http://www.collapsenet.com/free-resources/collapsenet-public-access/item/723-fallout" target="_blank">reported</a>, “In the wake of the continuing nuclear tragedy in Japan, the United States government is still moving quickly to increase the amounts of radiation the population can “safely” absorb by raising the safe zone for exposure to levels designed to protect the government and nuclear industry more than human life.”</p>
<p>The radiation has absolutely reached the shores of North America.  Water samples from across the continent have tested positive for unsafe levels of radioactivity.  <strong>The levels exceeded federal drinking water thresholds, known as maximum contaminant levels, or MCL, by as much as 181 times.”</strong>This means that the complete ecosystem of the Pacific Ocean is now poisoned with radiation and we aren’t being warned.</p>
<p>Samples of milk taken across the United States have shown <strong>radiation at levels 2000 percent higher than EPA maximums. </strong> The reason that milk is so significant is that it it representative of the entire food supply.  According to an article published on <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032048_radiation_milk.html#ixzz1qtscuekE" target="_blank">Natural News</a>, “Cows consume grass and are exposed to the same elements as food crops and water supplies. In other words, when cows’ milk starts testing positive for high levels of radioactive elements, this is indicative of <em><strong>radioactive contamination of the entire food supply.”</strong></em></p>
<p>The GMO Food and Drug Pushers Administration and the EnvironmentalDeception Protection Agency, instead of refusing to prohibit the sale of tainted foods and mandatory testing of foods produced and harvested from the Pacific Coast, have simply raised the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/03/government-responds-to-nuclear-accident-by-trying-to-raise-acceptable-radiation-levels-and-pretending-that-radiation-is-good-for-us.html" target="_blank">“acceptable levels”</a>  of radioactive material in foods.</p>
<p>Clearly, the “it’s-all-for-your-own-good” government will not protect us, or even inform us of the dangers so we can protect ourselves, because it might dip into the pockets of the global elite, the nuclear energy industry, and the food industries.  There is big money behind this cover-up. Refusing to purchase and consume their tainted goods is the best way to fight back, while keeping our families safe and healthy.</p>
<p>How can we protect ourselves? First, be aware of what items are likely to be highly tainted.</p>
<p>1.)  <strong>SEAFOOD</strong>:  Question the origin of ALL seafood.  Fish and crustaceans from the Pacific Ocean should all be considered to be poisoned with radiation.</p>
<p>2.)  <strong>WATER</strong>:  The rainfall and snowfall are all radiated.  Do not drink any water that has not been filtered.   The tap water that flows from your faucet has NOT been treated to rid it of radioactive particles. A recent report from the <a href="http://enenews.com/ny-times-contributor-confirms-california-rainwater-181-times-above-drinking-water-standards-for-radioactive-iodine-131" target="_blank">NY Times</a> stated, “A rooftop water monitoring program managed by UC Berkeley’s Department of Nuclear Engineering detected substantial spikes in rain-borne iodine-131 during torrential downpours …</p>
<p>3.) <strong>DAIRY PRODUCTS</strong>:  Milk and milk products from the West Coast states currently have the highest levels of radiation in North America.</p>
<p>4.)  <strong>PRODUCE</strong>:  Leafy Vegetables, Wines, Tomatoes, Strawberries….all produce from California or any other West Coast State are also likely to be tainted.</p>
</div>
<p>5.)  <strong>MEAT</strong>:  If a animal eats any leafy vegetable all along the West Coast, that animal has consumed radiation, and is poisoned.  This is any animal from cows, pigs, goats, sheep to wild deer and other game.</p>
<p>If you eat the above foods from areas with high radiation levels, you are eating radiation and feeding it to your children. Slowly the radiation levels within your body will build up.  <strong>This is PERMANENT</strong>.</p>
<p>Infant mortality rates across the United States have increased by more than 35% since the nuclear disaster, according to a court statement by Dr. with independent scientist Leuren Moret, MA, PhD.  A study published in <em><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medical-journal-article--14000-us-deaths-tied-to-fukushima-reactor-disaster-fallout-135859288.html" target="_blank">The International Journal of Medicine</a></em> indicates that more than 20,000 deaths right here in North America can be directly attributed to the release of radioactive material from Fukushima.</p>
<p>Radioactive isotopes of the type released from Fukushima have a half life of 30,000 years.  This means that we must permanently change the way we prepare our food.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wash your food with soap and rinse it in filtered water. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Be aware of the origins of your vegetables, fish, game and seafood.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep abreast of radiation levels to help monitor where your food is acquired.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use only filtered water for drinking, cooking and ice.</strong></li>
</ul>

			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/manning-wikileaks-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/manning-wikileaks-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a><em>&#8220;Defense lawyers say Manning was clearly a troubled young soldier whom the Army should never have deployed to Iraq or given access to classified material while he was stationed there &#8230; They say he was in emotional turmoil, partly because he was a gay soldier at a time when homosexuals were barred from serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.&#8221; </em>(Associated Press, February 3)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate and disturbing that Bradley Manning&#8217;s attorneys have chosen to consistently base his legal defense upon the premise that personal problems and shortcomings are what motivated the young man to turn over hundreds of thousands of classified government files to Wikileaks. They should not be presenting him that way any more than Bradley should be tried as a criminal or traitor. He should be hailed as a national hero. Yes, even when the lawyers are talking to the military mind. May as well try to penetrate that mind and find the freest and best person living there. Bradley also wears a military uniform.</p>
<p>Here are Manning&#8217;s own words from an online chat: &#8220;If you had free reign over classified networks &#8230; and you saw incredible things, awful things &#8230; things that belonged in the public domain, and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington DC &#8230; what would you do? &#8230; God knows what happens now. Hopefully worldwide discussion, debates, and reforms. &#8230; I want people to see the truth &#8230; because without information, you cannot make informed decisions as a public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is the world to believe that these are the words of a disturbed and irrational person? Do not the Nuremberg Tribunal and the Geneva Conventions speak of a higher duty than blind loyalty to one&#8217;s government, a duty to report the war crimes of that government?</p>
<p>Below is a listing of some of the things revealed in the State Department cables and Defense Department files and videos. For exposing such embarrassing and less-than-honorable behavior, Bradley Manning of the United States Army and Julian Assange of Wikileaks may spend most of their remaining days in a modern dungeon, much of it while undergoing that particular form of torture known as &#8220;solitary confinement&#8221;. Indeed, it has been suggested that the mistreatment of Manning has been for the purpose of making him testify against and implicating Assange. Dozens of members of the American media and public officials have called for Julian Assange&#8217;s execution or assassination. Under the new National Defense Authorization Act, Assange could well be kidnaped or assassinated. What century are we living in? What world?</p>
<p>It was after seeing American war crimes such as those depicted in the video &#8220;Collateral Murder&#8221; and documented in the &#8220;Iraq War Logs,&#8221; made public by Manning and Wikileaks, that the Iraqis refused to exempt US forces from prosecution for future crimes. The video depicts an American helicopter indiscriminately murdering several non-combatants in addition to two Reuters journalists, and the wounding of two little children, while the helicopter pilots cheer the attacks in a Baghdad suburb like it was the Army-Navy game in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The insistence of the Iraqi government on legal jurisdiction over American soldiers for violations of Iraqi law — something the United States rarely, if ever, accepts in any of the many countries where its military is stationed — forced the Obama administration to pull the remaining American troops from the country.</p>
<p>If Manning had committed war crimes in Iraq instead of exposing them, he would be a free man today, as are the many hundreds/thousands of American soldiers guilty of truly loathsome crimes in cities like Haditha, Fallujah, and other places whose names will live in infamy in the land of ancient Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Besides playing a role in writing finis to the awful Iraq war, the Wikileaks disclosures helped to spark the Arab Spring, beginning in Tunisia.</p>
<p>When people in Tunisia read or heard of US Embassy cables revealing the extensive corruption and decadence of the extended ruling family there — one long and detailed cable being titled: &#8220;CORRUPTION IN TUNISIA: WHAT&#8217;S YOURS IS MINE&#8221; — how Washington&#8217;s support of Tunisian President Ben Ali was not really strong, and that the US would not support the regime in the event of a popular uprising, they took to the streets.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of some of the other Wikileaks revelations that make the people of the world wiser:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2009 Japanese diplomat Yukiya Amano became the new head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which plays the leading role in the investigation of whether Iran is developing nuclear weapons or is working only on peaceful civilian nuclear energy projects. A US embassy cable of October 2009 said Amano &#8220;took pains to emphasize his support for U.S. strategic objectives for the Agency. Amano reminded the [American] ambassador on several occasions that &#8230; he was solidly in the U.S. court on every key strategic decision, from high-level personnel appointments to the handling of Iran&#8217;s alleged nuclear weapons program.&#8221;</li>
<li>Russia refuted US claims that Iran has missiles that could target Europe.</li>
<li>The British government&#8217;s official inquiry into how it got involved in the Iraq War was deeply compromised by the government&#8217;s pledge to protect the Bush administration in the course of the inquiry.</li>
<li>A discussion between Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and American Gen. David H. Petraeus in which Saleh indicated he would cover up the US role in missile strikes against al-Qaeda&#8217;s affiliate in Yemen. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours,&#8221; Saleh told Petraeus.</li>
<li>The US embassy in Madrid has had serious points of friction with the Spanish government and civil society: a) trying to get the criminal case dropped against three US soldiers accused of killing a Spanish television cameraman in Baghdad during a 2003 unprovoked US tank shelling of the hotel where he and other journalists were staying; b )torture cases brought by a Spanish NGO against six senior Bush administration officials, including former attorney general Alberto Gonzales; c) a Spanish government investigation into the torture of Spanish subjects held at Guantánamo; d) a probe by a Spanish court into the use of Spanish bases and airfields for American extraordinary rendition (= torture) flights; e )continual criticism of the Iraq war by Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero, who eventually withdrew Spanish troops.</li>
<li>State Department officials at the United Nations, as well as US diplomats in various embassies, were assigned to gather as much of the following information as possible about UN officials, including Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, permanent security council representatives, senior UN staff, and foreign diplomats: e-mail and website addresses, internet user names and passwords, personal encryption keys, credit card numbers, frequent flyer account numbers, work schedules, and biometric data. US diplomats at the embassy in Asunción, Paraguay were asked to obtain dates, times and telephone numbers of calls received and placed by foreign diplomats from China, Iran and the Latin American leftist states of Cuba, Venezuela and Bolivia. US diplomats in Romania, Hungary and Slovenia were instructed to provide biometric information on &#8220;current and emerging leaders and advisers&#8221; as well as information about &#8220;corruption&#8221; and information about leaders&#8217; health and &#8220;vulnerability&#8221;. The UN directive also specifically asked for &#8220;biometric information on ranking North Korean diplomats&#8221;. A similar cable to embassies in the Great Lakes region of Africa said biometric data included DNA, as well as iris scans and fingerprints.</li>
<li>A special &#8220;Iran observer&#8221; in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku reported on a dispute that played out during a meeting of Iran&#8217;s Supreme National Security Council. An enraged Revolutionary Guard Chief of Staff, Mohammed Ali Jafari, allegedly got into a heated argument with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and slapped him in the face because the generally conservative president had, surprisingly, advocated freedom of the press.</li>
<li>The State Department, virtually alone in the Western Hemisphere, did not unequivocally condemn a June 28, 2009 military coup in Honduras, even though an embassy cable declared: &#8220;there is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch&#8221;. US support of the coup government has been unwavering ever since.</li>
<li>The leadership of the Swedish Social Democratic Party — neutral, pacifist, and liberal Sweden, so the long-standing myth goes — visited the US embassy in Stockholm and asked for advice on how best to sell the war in Afghanistan to a skeptical Swedish public, asking if the US could arrange for a member of the Afghan government to come visit Sweden and talk up NATO&#8217;s humanitarian efforts on behalf of Afghan children, and so forth. [For some years now Sweden has been, in all but name, a member of NATO and the persecutor of Julian Assange, the latter to please a certain Western power.]</li>
<li>The US pushed to influence Swedish wiretapping laws so communication passing through the Scandinavian country could be intercepted. The American interest was clear: Eighty per cent of all the internet traffic from Russia travels through Sweden.</li>
<li>President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy told US embassy officials in Brussels in January 2010 that no one in Europe believed in Afghanistan anymore. He said Europe was going along in deference to the United States and that there must be results in 2010, or &#8220;Afghanistan is over for Europe.&#8221;</li>
<li>Iraqi officials saw Saudi Arabia, not Iran, as the biggest threat to the integrity and cohesion of their fledgling democratic state. The Iraqi leaders were keen to assure their American patrons that they could easily &#8220;manage&#8221; the Iranians, who wanted stability; but that the Saudis wanted a &#8220;weak and fractured&#8221; Iraq, and were even &#8220;fomenting terrorism that would destabilize the government&#8221;. The Saudi King, moreover, wanted a US military strike on Iran.</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia in 2007 threatened to pull out of a Texas oil refinery investment unless the US government intervened to stop Saudi Aramco from being sued in US courts for alleged oil price fixing. The deputy Saudi oil minister said that he wanted the US to grant Saudi Arabia sovereign immunity from lawsuits</li>
<li>Saudi donors were the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like Al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks.</li>
<li>Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest pharmaceutical company, hired investigators to unearth evidence of corruption against the Nigerian attorney general in order to persuade him to drop legal action over a controversial 1996 drug trial involving children with meningitis.</li>
<li>Oil giant Shell claimed to have &#8220;inserted staff&#8221; and fully infiltrated Nigeria&#8217;s government.</li>
<li>The Obama administration renewed military ties with Indonesia in spite of serious concerns expressed by American diplomats about the Indonesian military&#8217;s activities in the province of West Papua, expressing fears that the Indonesian government&#8217;s neglect, rampant corruption and human rights abuses were stoking unrest in the region.</li>
<li>US officials collaborated with Lebanon&#8217;s defense minister to spy on, and allow Israel to potentially attack, Hezbollah in the weeks that preceded a violent May 2008 military confrontation in Beirut.</li>
<li>Gabon president Omar Bongo allegedly pocketed millions in embezzled funds from central African states, channeling some of it to French political parties in support of Nicolas Sarkozy.</li>
<li>Cables from the US embassy in Caracas in 2006 asked the US Secretary of State to warn President Hugo Chávez against a Venezuelan military intervention to defend the Cuban revolution in the eventuality of an American invasion after Castro&#8217;s death.</li>
<li>The United States was concerned that the leftist Latin American television network, Telesur, headquartered in Venezuela, would collaborate with al Jazeera of Qatar, whose coverage of the Iraq War had gotten under the skin of the Bush administration.</li>
<li>The Vatican told the United States it wanted to undermine the influence of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Latin America because of concerns about the deterioration of Catholic power there. It feared that Chávez was seriously damaging relations between the Catholic church and the state by identifying the church hierarchy in Venezuela as part of the privileged class.</li>
<li>The Holy See welcomed President Obama&#8217;s new outreach to Cuba and hoped for further steps soon, perhaps to include prison visits for the wives of the Cuban Five. Better US-Cuba ties would deprive Hugo Chávez of one of his favorite screeds and could help restrain him in the region.</li>
<li>The wonderful world of diplomats: In 2010, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown raised with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the question of visas for two wives of members of the &#8220;Cuban Five&#8221;. &#8220;Brown requested that the wives (who have previously been refused visas to visit the U.S.) be granted visas so that they could visit their husbands in prison. &#8230; Our subsequent queries to Number 10 indicate that Brown made this request as a result of a commitment that he had made to UK trade unionists, who form part of the Labour Party&#8217;s core constituency. Now that the request has been made, Brown does not intend to pursue this matter further. There is no USG action required.&#8221;</li>
<li>UK Officials concealed from Parliament how the US was allowed to bring cluster bombs onto British soil in defiance of a treaty banning the housing of such weapons.</li>
<li>A cable was sent by an official at the US Interests Section in Havana in July 2006, during the runup to the Non-Aligned Movement conference. He noted that he was actively looking for &#8220;human interest stories and other news that shatters the myth of Cuban medical prowess&#8221;. [Presumably to be used to weaken support for Cuba amongst the member nations at the conference.]</li>
<li>Most of the men sent to Guantánamo prison were innocent people or low-level operatives; many of the innocent individuals were sold to the US for bounty.</li>
<li>DynCorp, a powerful American defense contracting firm that claims almost $2 billion per year in revenue from US tax dollars, threw a &#8220;boy-play&#8221; party for Afghan police recruits. (Yes, it&#8217;s what you think.)</li>
<li>Even though the Bush and Obama Administrations repeatedly maintained publicly that there was no official count of civilian casualties, the Iraq and Afghanistan War Logs showed that this claim was untrue.</li>
<li>Known Egyptian torturers received training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.</li>
<li>The United States put great pressure on the Haitian government to not go ahead with various projects, with no regard for the welfare of the Haitian people. A 2005 cable stressed continued US insistence that all efforts must be made to keep former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom the United States had overthrown the previous year, from returning to Haiti or influencing the political process. In 2006, Washington&#8217;s target was President René Préval for his agreeing to a deal with Venezuela to join Caracas&#8217;s Caribbean oil alliance, PetroCaribe, under which Haiti would buy oil from Venezuela, paying only 60 percent up front with the remainder payable over twenty-five years at 1 percent interest. And in 2009, the State Department backed American corporate opposition to an increase in the minimum wage for Haitian workers, the poorest paid in the Western Hemisphere.</li>
<li>The United States used threats, spying, and more to try to get its way at the crucial 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen.</li>
<li>Mahmoud Abbas, president of The Palestinian National Authority, and head of the Fatah movement, turned to Israel for help in attacking Hamas in Gaza in 2007.</li>
<li>The British government trained a Bangladeshi paramilitary force condemned by human rights organisations as a &#8220;government death squad&#8221;.</li>
<li>A US military order directed American forces not to investigate cases of torture of detainees by Iraqis.</li>
<li>The US was involved in the Australian government&#8217;s 2006 campaign to oust Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.</li>
<li>A 2009 US cable said that police brutality in Egypt against common criminals was routine and pervasive, the police using force to extract confessions from criminals on a daily basis.</li>
<li>US diplomats pressured the German government to stifle the prosecution of CIA operatives who abducted and tortured Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen. [El-Masri was kidnaped by the CIA while on vacation in Macedonia on December 31, 2003. He was flown to a torture center in Afghanistan, where he was beaten, starved, and sodomized. The US government released him on a hilltop in Albania five months later without money or the means to go home.]</li>
<li>2005 cable re &#8220;widespread severe torture&#8221; by India, the widely-renowned &#8220;world&#8217;s largest democracy&#8221;: The International Committee of the Red Cross reported: &#8220;The continued ill-treatment of detainees, despite longstanding ICRC-GOI [Government of India] dialogue, have led the ICRC to conclude that New Delhi condones torture.&#8221; Washington was briefed on this matter by the ICRC years ago. What did the United States, one of the world&#8217;s leading practitioners and teachers of torture in the past century, do about it? American leaders, including the present ones, continued to speak warmly of &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest democracy&#8221;; as if torture and one of the worst rates of poverty and child malnutrition in the world do not contradict the very idea of democracy.</li>
<li>The United States overturned a ban on training the Indonesian Kopassus army special forces — despite the Kopassus&#8217;s long history of arbitrary detention, torture and murder — after the Indonesian President threatened to derail President Obama&#8217;s trip to the country in November 2010.</li>
<li>Since at least 2006 the United States has been funding political opposition groups in Syria, including a satellite TV channel that beams anti-government programming into the country.</li>

</div>
<p>Remember the real reason why <a href="http://batr.org/reactionary/030611.html">Moammar Gadhafi</a> is dead. He dared to propose and started creating an alternative currency to the world reserve U.S. Dollar. The lesson learned in Libya is now ready for teaching in Iran. Forget all the noise about going nuclear, the true message is that the banksters rule and nation states serve their ultimate masters. The hype and disinformation that surrounds the push for war is best understood by examining the viewpoint of Iranian MP Kazem Jalali. The <a href="http://www.tehrantimes.com/politics/94818-iran-oil-embargo-meant-to-politicize-atmosphere-for-51-talks-mp">Tehran Times</a> quotes him in saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The European Union must be aware that it can never compel the Islamic Republic to succumb to their will and undermine the Iranian nation’s determination to achieve glory and independence, access modern technologies, and safeguard its rights, through the intensification of the pressure.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The European Union is seeking to politicize the atmosphere ahead of nuclear talks with Iran and is aware that sanctions on Iran’s oil exports cannot be implemented since the world is not limited to a number of European countries&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many political commentators warn that an embargo is an act or war. <a href="http://www.chris-floyd.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/2210-pups-on-parade-eu-obediently-pushes-toward-war-with-iran.html">Chris Floyd</a> provides this observation of the recent oil embargo against Iran.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This week, the warlords of the West took yet another step toward their long-desired war against Iran. (Open war, that is; their covert war has been going on for decades &#8212; via subversion, terrorism, and proxies like Saddam Hussein.) On Monday, the European Union obediently followed the dictates of its Washington masters by agreeing to impose an embargo on Iranian oil.</p>
<p>The embargo bans all new oil contracts with Iran, and cuts off all existing deals after July. The embargo is accompanied by a freeze on all European assets of the Iranian central bank. In imposing these draconian measures on a country which is not at war with any nation, which has not invaded or attacked another nation in centuries, and which is developing a nuclear energy program that is not only entirely legal under international law but is also subject to the most stringent international inspection regime ever seen, the EU is &#8220;targeting the economic lifeline of the regime,&#8221; as one of its diplomats put it, with admirable candor.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The most important aspect of the Iranian response lies in the way that changes oil settlement for delivery and the futile effect of the US/Anglo/EU imperialist dictates have in the marketplace.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.debka.com/article/21673/">Debkafile</a> reports that India (and probably China) will pay for Iranian oil in gold.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;India and China take about one million barrels per day, or 40 percent of Iran&#8217;s total exports of 2.5 million bpd. Both are superpowers in terms of gold assets.</p>
<p>By trading in gold, New Delhi and Beijing enable Tehran to bypass the upcoming freeze on its central bank&#8217;s assets and the oil embargo which the European Union&#8217;s foreign ministers agreed to impose Monday, Jan. 23. The EU currently buys around 20 percent of Iran&#8217;s oil exports.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A more detailed analysis in <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=28854">Tehran Pushes to Ditch the US Dollar</a> provided ample arguments that an embargo will fail.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Iran may be isolated from the United States and Western Europe, but Tehran still has some pretty staunch allies. Iran and Venezuela are advancing $4 billion worth of joint projects, including a bank. India has pledged to continue buying Iranian oil because Tehran has been a great business partner for New Delhi, which struggles to make its payments. Greece opposed the EU sanctions because Iran was one of very few suppliers that had been letting the bankrupt Greeks buy oil on credit. South Korea and Japan are pleading for exemptions from the coming embargoes because they rely on Iranian oil. Economic ties between Russia and Iran are getting stronger every year.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s China. Iran&#8217;s energy resources are a matter of national security for China, as Iran already supplies no less than 15% of China&#8217;s oil and natural gas. That makes Iran more important to China than Saudi Arabia is to the United States. Don&#8217;t expect China to heed the US and EU sanctions much – China will find a way around the sanctions in order to protect two-way trade between the nations, which currently stands at $30 billion and is expected to hit $50 billion in 2015. In fact, China will probably gain from the US and EU sanctions on Iran, as it will be able to buy oil and gas from Iran at depressed prices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bzr9zEN00As" frameborder="0" width="480" height="315"></iframe></center></p>
<p>So why is the EU so determined to apply restrictions is answered in the video, <a href="http://youtu.be/Bzr9zEN00As">Why does the EU join in sanctions against Iran?</a></p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-UgwVzleLck" frameborder="0" width="480" height="315"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that is part of the reason but for the entire story, one needs to confront the contentions in the You Tube <a href="http://youtu.be/-UgwVzleLck">Israel pulling the strings for war with Iran</a>.</p>
<p>Where is gets so confusing for the casual observer is that any discussion that deems to be critical of Israel is a taboo discussion in polite company. Well, when it comes to addressing the impending prospects of a major conflict in the Middle East, the linkage between the deciding influences in American policy that coincide with a greater Israel objective, is silenced in the old-line press and media. Therefore, the key element to explore is the relationship of Zionist interests with the fundamental preservation of the paper currency imperium of Federal Reserve notes as the medium of payment for oil.</p>
<p>Think about this equation in light of ultimate control. Oil is the fuel that runs the engine of all economies. Money is the medium of exchange that pays for the petroleum. War is the universal method used to avoid the breakdown of the money recycling system. In <a href="http://batr.org/view/040403.html">The Petro-Dollar and the EURO</a>, the nature of this formula is probed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;War is always about achieving a political end. Even holy wars seek to impose a secular control over the vanquished. At the root of every political conflict, lies the MONEY component. On the scale of greed or fear, international discords can slide up or down. Depending on the circumstances or demands, governments rally domestic populations to accept their foreign interventionist goals. Claims of altruistic liberation are fictitious, when the rhetoric is stripped away and the real substance is exposed. Notwithstanding, variances of emphasis; the motive of money underpins the movements of all military confrontations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Who can deny that the interest of the Israeli state advances under the Petro-Dollar system for oil payment? The prospect of allowing an oil exporter to do business paid in gold disrupts the balances that maintain an uneasy political rapprochement. Even more threatening to the globalist monopoly is a defiant regime like the Islamic Republic playing by different rules that bypass central banking approval.</p>
<p>It seems that the NeoCon Christian Zionists will never be happy until they institute a techno drone bombing campaign to shut off even more oil resources. With Iraqi and Libyan production in shambles, it is now time to eliminate the Iranian resource. Spiking oil to $200 or more through another foreign intervention just hikes the balance sheets of the oil traders and banking interests. There is no doubt that foreign aid to Israel will rise at even a higher amount.</p>
<p>The bonus is that the gold hordes of Iran would become the spoils of war and conveniently find their way into the storage vaults of the banksters. This is a sweet game as long as there is a continuous supply of gung ho mercenaries to push the button of terror from the skies. Moreover, sending boots on the ground serve an even more profitable hellhole, the War Party can demand a much higher budget, floated with even more debt bought by China with the proceeds from the oil supply that are secured from the export of Canadian shale oil.</p>
<p>Miraculously, this pattern builds an even larger, if not, greater empire. As long as new villains are found to master, the Iran’s of the world will become subjugated under the background music of God Bless America.</p>
<p>What fools our fellow citizens became somewhere in the last century. Remember the John D. Rockefeller quote: &#8220;Competition is a sin&#8221;, especially if IRAN is the player.</p>
<p>Body bags are made from petroleum base material. In the height of irony, the oil wars are fought to secure the substance to form the burial cloth for disposable soldiers. If America really wants to stand behind the troops, their genuine duty is to prevent and oppose the next Middle East war.</p>
<p>Iran is not an existential threat to the United States. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/former-mossad-chief-israeli-strike-on-iran-will-lead-to-regional-war-1.398537">Haaretz</a>reports that former Mossad chief Meir Dagan said in a television interview, &#8220;If Israel attacks Iran, it will be dragged into a regional war&#8221;. According to Dagan, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas will respond with massive rocket attacks on Israel. In that scenario, Syria may join in the fray, Dagan said on the television program &#8220;Uvda&#8221;. Dagan added that such a war would take a heavy toll in terms of loss of life and would paralyze life in Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p>An America First foreign policy cannot wage another banksters war.</p>
