<p>When it gets complicated and confusing, when you’re overwhelmed with too much information, changing daily; too many explanations, some contradictory … try putting it into some kind of context by stepping back and looking at the larger, long-term picture.</p>
<p>The United States strives for world domination, hegemony wherever possible, their main occupation for over a century, it’s what they do for a living. The United States, NATO and the European Union form The Holy Triumvirate. The Holy Triumvirate has subsidiaries, chiefly The International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organization, International Criminal Court … all help to keep in line those governments lacking the Holy Triumvirate Seal Of Approval: the IMF, WB, and WTO impose market fundamentalism, while foreign leaders who act too independent are threatened with being handed over to the ICC for heavy punishment, as the United States imposes sanctions on governments and their leaders as only the King of Sanctions can, lacking any sense of hypocrisy or irony.</p>
<p>And who threatens United States domination? Who can challenge The Holy Triumvirate’s hegemony? Only Russia and China, if they were as imperialistic as the Western powers. (No, the Soviet Union wasn’t imperialistic; that was self-defense; Eastern Europe was a highway twice used by the West to invade; tens of millions of Russians killed or wounded.)</p>
<p>Since the end of the Cold War the United States has been surrounding Russia, building one base after another, ceaselessly looking for new ones, including in Ukraine; one missile site after another, with Moscow in range; NATO has grabbed one former Soviet Republic after another. The White House, and the unquestioning American mainstream media, have assured us that such operations have nothing to do with Russia. And Russia has been told the same, much to Moscow’s continuous skepticism. “Look,” said Russian president Vladimir Putin about NATO some years ago, “is this is a military organization? Yes, it’s military. … Is it moving towards our border? It’s moving towards our border. Why?”</p>
<p>The Holy Triumvirate would love to rip Ukraine from the Moscow bosom, evict the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and establish a US military and/or NATO presence on Russia’s border. (In case you were wondering what prompted the Russian military action.) Kiev’s membership in the EU would then not be far off; after which the country could embrace the joys of neo-conservatism, receiving the benefits of the standard privatization-deregulation-austerity package and join Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain as an impoverished orphan of the family; but no price is too great to pay to for being part of glorious Europe and the West!</p>
<p>The Ukrainian insurgents and their Western-power supporters didn’t care who their Ukrainian allies were in carrying out their coup against President Viktor Yanukovych last month … thugs who set policemen on fire head to toe … all manner of extreme right-wingers, including Chechnyan Islamic militants  … a deputy of the ultra-right Svoboda Party, part of the new government, who threatens to rebuild Ukraine’s nukes in three to six months.  … the snipers firing on the protestors who apparently were not what they appeared to be – A bugged phone conversation between Urmas Paet, the Estonian foreign minister, and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, reveals Paet saying: “There is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers it was not Yanukovych, but it was somebody from the new coalition.”  … neo-Nazi protestors in Kiev who have openly denounced Jews, hoisting a banner honoring Stepan Bandera, the infamous Ukrainian nationalist who collaborated with the German Nazis during World War II and whose militias participated in atrocities against Jews and Poles.</p>
<p>The Israeli newspaper <em>Haaretz</em> reported on February 24 that Ukrainian Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman advised “Kiev’s Jews to leave the city and even the country.” Edward Dolinsky, head of an umbrella organization of Ukrainian Jews, described the situation for Ukrainian Jews as “dire” and requested Israel’s help.</p>
<p>All in all a questionable gang of allies for a dubious cause; reminiscent of the Kosovo Liberation Army thugs Washington put into power for an earlier regime change, and has kept in power since 1999.</p>
<p>The now-famous recorded phone conversation between top US State Department official Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador to the Ukraine, wherein they discuss which Ukrainians would be to Washington’s liking in a new government, and which not, is an example of this regime-change mentality. Nuland’s choice, Arseniy Yatseniuk, emerged as interim prime minister.</p>
<p>The National Endowment for Democracy, an agency created by the Reagan administration in 1983 to promote political action and psychological warfare against states not in love with US foreign policy, is Washington’s foremost non-military tool for effecting regime change. The NED website lists 65 projects that it has supported financially in recent years in Ukraine.  The descriptions NED gives to the projects don’t reveal the fact that generally their programs impart the basic philosophy that working people and other citizens are best served under a system of free enterprise, class cooperation, collective bargaining, minimal government intervention in the economy, and opposition to socialism in any shape or form. A free-market economy is equated with democracy, reform, and growth; and the merits of foreign investment in their economy are emphasized.</p>
<p>The idea was that the NED would do somewhat overtly what the CIA had been doing covertly for decades, and thus, hopefully, eliminate the stigma associated with CIA covert activities. Allen Weinstein, who helped draft the legislation establishing NED, declared in 1991: “A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.”</p>
<p>NED, receives virtually all its financing from the US government ($5 billion in total since 1991  ), but it likes to refer to itself as an NGO (Non-governmental organization) because this helps to maintain a certain credibility abroad that an official US government agency might not have. But NGO is the wrong category. NED is a GO. Its long-time intervention in Ukraine is as supra-legal as the Russian military deployment there. Journalist Robert Parry has observed:</p>
<blockquote><p>For NED and American neocons, Yanukovych’s electoral legitimacy lasted only as long as he accepted European demands for new “trade agreements” and stern economic “reforms” required by the International Monetary Fund. When Yanukovych was negotiating those pacts, he won praise, but when he judged the price too high for Ukraine and opted for a more generous deal from Russia, he immediately became a target for “regime change.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, we have to ask, as Mr. Putin asked – “Why?” Why has NED been funding 65 projects in one foreign country? Why were Washington officials grooming a replacement for President Yanukovych, legally and democratically elected in 2010, who, in the face of protests, moved elections up so he could have been voted out of office – not thrown out by a mob? Yanukovych made repeated important concessions, including amnesty for those arrested and offering, on January 25, to make two of his adversaries prime minister and deputy prime minister; all to no avail; key elements of the protestors, and those behind them, wanted their <em>putsch</em>.</p>
<p>Carl Gershman, president of NED, wrote last September that “Ukraine is the biggest prize”.  The man knows whereof he speaks. He has presided over NED since its beginning, overseeing the Rose Revolution in Georgia (2003), the Orange Revolution in Ukraine (2004), the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon (2005), the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan (2005), the Green Revolution in Iran (2009), and now Ukraine once again. It’s as if the Cold War never ended.</p>
<p>The current unbridled animosity of the American media toward Putin also reflects an old practice. The United States is so accustomed to world leaders holding their tongue and not voicing criticism of Washington’s policies appropriate to the criminality of those policies, that when a Vladimir Putin comes along and expresses even a relatively mild condemnation he is labeled Public Enemy Number One and his words are accordingly ridiculed or ignored.</p>
<p>On March 2 US Secretary of State John Kerry condemned Russia’s “incredible act of aggression” in Ukraine (Crimea) and threatened economic sanctions. “You just don’t in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on completely trumped up pre-text.”</p>
<p>Iraq was in the 21st century. Senator John Kerry voted for it. Hypocrisy of this magnitude has to be respected.</p>
<p><strong>POSTSCRIPT:</strong> Ukraine’s interim prime minister announced March 7 that he has invited the NATO Council to hold a meeting in Kiev over the recent developments in the country. “I invited the North Atlantic Council to visit Kiev and hold a meeting there,” Arseny Yatsenyuk said during a visit to Brussels, where he met with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and EU officials. “We believe that it will strengthen our cooperation.”</p>

<p>Confrontation is a necessary dam to the progress of evil in society.</p>
<p>American policy is now confined to determining which of two evils will be rewarded.  For decades conservatives have been voting for the lesser of two evils, impaired by party loyalty and seeking a maligned victory, they fail to confront egregious evil.</p>
<p>Evil is inherent in diversity.  The exclusive righteousness characteristic of ancient Israel was predicated on maintaining religious purity.  That purity is being consistently destructed by toleration.</p>
<p>Christian churches should be at the forefront in confronting these dangers.  It is not surprising that the scant confrontation evidenced in the public domain is coming from Christians.  Nor is it surprising that Christian ministers pre-occupied with growing larger and more powerful churches are wont to confront evil either in the society at large or in their own congregations.</p>
<p>In February, 1994, the late Mother Theresa of Calcutta speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast with then President William Jefferson Clinton and his wife Hillary in the audience made the <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/<wbr></a>brochures/mtspeech.html&#8221;>following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself.</p>
<p>And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another? How do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? As always, we must persuade her with love and we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave even His life to love us. So, the mother who is thinking of abortion, should be helped to love, that is, to give until it hurts her plans, or her free time, to respect the life of her child. The father of that child, whoever he is, must also give until it hurts.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In January,1996, Pastor Joe Wright was invited to give the invocation as guest chaplain of the Kansas House.  The prayer he read was authored by Pastor Bob Russell of the Southeast Christian Church in Louisville, Kentucky.  <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/k/kansasprayer.htm#.UxDfu8uYYdU">Included in the prayer was the following litany</a>:</p>
<p>We have lost our spiritual equilibrium and inverted our values.</p>
<blockquote><p>We confess that we have ridiculed the absolute truth of Your Word and called it moral pluralism.</p>
<p>We have worshiped other gods and called it multiculturalism.</p>
<p>We have endorsed perversion and called it an alternative lifestyle.</p>
<p>We have exploited the poor and called it the lottery.</p>
<p>We have neglected the needy and called it self-preservation.</p>
<p>We have rewarded laziness and called it welfare.</p>
<p>We have killed our unborn and called it choice.</p>
<p>We have shot abortionists and called it justifiable.</p>
<p>We have neglected to discipline our children and called it building self-esteem.</p>
<p>We have abused power and called it political savvy.</p>
<p>We have coveted our neighbors’ possessions and called it ambition.</p>
<p>We have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of expression.</p>
<p>We have ridiculed the time-honored values of our forefathers and called it enlightenment.</p></blockquote>
<p>In May, 1999, Darrell Scott, whose daughter Rachel was fatally shot at Littleton, Colorado’s Columbine High School, included the following poem in his poignant remarks before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee:</p>
<blockquote><p><center>Your laws ignore our deepest needs<br />
Your words are empty air<br />
You&#8217;ve stripped away our heritage<br />
You&#8217;ve outlawed simple prayer<br />
Now gunshots fill our classrooms<br />
And precious children die<br />
You seek for answers everywhere<br />
And ask the question &#8220;Why&#8221;<br />
You regulate restrictive laws<br />
Through legislative creed<br />
And yet you fail to understand that<br />
God is what we need!</center></p></blockquote>
<p>Hardness in the reprobate heart repels the confrontation of wisdom.  Mother Theresa’s sweet rebuke of the Clinton stand on abortion was quickly forgotten.  Several walked out on the repentant prayer read by Pastor Joe Wright and Darrell Scott’s confrontation of the House Judiciary subcommittee was like a drop of fresh water in a cesspool.</p>
<p>Error (polite for sin) is a common denominator to human existence and when it is not confronted it metastasizes.  In an effort to preserve their right to debauchery Americans have elevated human comfort above human righteousness.  They have failed to confront lies and distortions of fact in an effort to maintain peace.  This most grievous of errors has become pandemic in our churches rendering them useless in the maintenance of Godly Wisdom and Righteousness.</p>
<p>Fred Reed in one of his recent insightful columns concerning the press writes, “because of law, convention, and political fear papers have to hire &#8220;diverse&#8221; newsrooms. This exercises a powerful flattening effect on the news. For practical purposes it is not possible to express opinions, or to cover stories, that offend a sizable group on the floor of the newsroom. If your editor is female, or the guy at the next desk black, or gay, you find it very hard to write anything that these groups won’t like. You have to come to work every day. <a href="http://fredoneverything.net/ThisWeek'sFred.shtml">More diversity in the newsroom means less diversity in the news.</a>”</p>
<p>In a Brian Lamb interview on C-Span a caller queried Midge Dector, a Zionist Jewish author and wife of Neo-Con Norman Podhoretz, about why Jewish-Americans predominate in our superstructure.  The caller, who was able to announce that Jews make up a tiny fraction of the American population but have a tremendous amount of power, was loutishly cut off by Brian Lamb and Midge Dector with a straight but distasteful look on her face denied the existence of extensive Jewish power.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a lie.  Jewish intellectualism is cherished. They are a hardworking, intelligent, well educated, collusive, quasi-patriotic group of unassimilated Americans whose quest for behind the scenes power has been generously rewarded.</p>
<p>The road to Hell is paved with the inability to confront lies and America has been in the paving business for several decades.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the American media hides facts and perpetrates lies.  While the quest for world government with all of its ancillary plots forges fearlessly ahead, detailed discussion of its disastrous consequences for the American people is studiously avoided.</p>
<p>Reporting on confrontations that involve truth are never widely covered in the media.  With all the ballyhoo that is made about freedom of the press, America has not enjoyed a free press for a long time.  As Fred Reed so aptly states, the press is “controlled, controlled, controlled”.</p>
<p>Pictures of aborted babies are avoided; the cruel results of war and the mutilated bodies it produces are never shown to the public; neither the scourge of AIDS nor homosexual activities are reported in all their ugliness; diversity is promoted for America but not for Israel; the efficacy of Christianity is regularly questioned and authentic movies such as “The Passion of Christ” are denigrated.  America’s press, ridden with bias and homogeneity, is a threat to the Nation.</p>
<p>The recent ruckus over “The Passion of Christ” has brought the errant nature the media elite into focus.</p>
<p>To question the right of a Christian American to produce a Biblically authentic movie on the death of Christ because it does not conform to the Jewish agenda and the contrived propaganda of Abe Foxman and the Anti-Defamation League is both an example of the power of Jewish influence in America and a travesty of major proportions for both <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig4/lapin3.html">Jews and Christians</a>.</p>
<p>In an essay entitled “The Passion of the Christ, the Jews, and God” Screenwriter Brian Godawa addresses this problem with the following conclusion: <em>“So to understand the New Testament claims of Jesus as Messiah is to understand a history of Israel that includes hundreds of years of stiff-necked resistance to God&#8217;s own prophets, building to a climactic rejection and killing of God&#8217;s own Son, the Messiah, followed by the persecution of Messiah&#8217;s followers and terminating in God&#8217;s wrath and vengeance being taken out on the nation by the destruction of the holy city of Jerusalem and its temple. The barrenness of that temple, still desolate for over 2000 years, is a testament to the new spiritual temple created by God, the body of Christ — a new “nation” consisting of Jews and Gentiles who both have faith in Messiah, a Messiah, as portrayed in the movie The Passion of the Christ, whose rejection and victimization made Him the “unblemished lamb of sacrifice” slain on God&#8217;s altar to accomplish the victorious redemption of His people, the forgiveness of their sins.”</em></p>
<p>In his unique style Fred Reed praises the opportunity we all have on the Internet to express ideas that would never be inked in our newspapers.  This is, indeed, an exceptional opportunity but one that will surely be under attack by those that seek to exert their evil agenda over America.</p>

<p>As you probably know by now, Obama and Co. have ousted Ukraine’s democratically-elected president, Viktor Yanukovych, with the help of ultra-right, paramilitary, neo-Nazi gangs who seized and burned government offices, killed riot police, and spread mayhem and terror across the country. These are America’s new allies in the Great Game, the grand plan to “pivot to Asia” by pushing further eastward, toppling peaceful governments, securing vital pipeline corridors, accessing scarce oil and natural gas reserves and dismantling the Russian Federation consistent with the strategy proposed by geopolitical mastermind, Zbigniew Brzezinski. Brzezinski’s magnum opus–”The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and it’s Geostrategic Imperatives” has become the Mein Kampf for aspiring western imperialists. It provides the basic blueprint for establishing US military-political-economic hegemony in the century’s most promising and prosperous region, Asia. In an article in Foreign Affairs Brzezinski laid out his ideas about neutralizing Russia by splitting the country into smaller parts, thus, allowing the US to maintain its dominant role in the region without threat of challenge or interference. Here’s an excerpt from the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Given (Russia’s) size and diversity, a decentralized political system and free-market economics would be most likely to unleash the creative potential of the Russian people and Russia’s vast natural resources. A loosely confederated Russia — composed of a European Russia, a Siberian Republic, and a Far Eastern Republic — would also find it easier to cultivate closer economic relations with its neighbors. Each of the confederated entitles would be able to tap its local creative potential, stifled for centuries by Moscow’s heavy bureaucratic hand. In turn, a decentralized Russia would be less susceptible to imperial mobilization.” (Zbigniew Brzezinski,“A Geostrategy for Eurasia”)</p></blockquote>
<p>Moscow is keenly aware of Washington’s divide and conquer strategy, but has downplayed the issue in order to avoid a confrontation. The US-backed coup in Ukraine means that that option is no longer feasible. Russia will have to respond to a provocation that threatens both its security and vital interests. Early reports suggest that Putin has already mobilized troops to the East and –according to Reuters “put fighter jets along its western borders on combat alert.” Here’s more from Reuters:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The United States says any Russian military action would be a grave mistake. But Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement that Moscow would defend the rights of its compatriots and react without compromise to any violation of those rights.” (Reuters)</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s going to be a confrontation, it’s just a matter of whether the fighting will escalate or not.</p>
<p>In order to topple Yanukovych, the US had to tacitly support fanatical groups of neo-Nazi thugs and anti-Semites. And, even though “Interim Ukrainian President Oleksander Tuchynov has pledged to do everything in his power to protect the country’s Jewish community”; reports on the ground are not so encouraging. Here’s an excerpt from a statement by Natalia Vitrenko, of The Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine that suggests the situation is much worse than what is being reported in the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Across the country… People are being beaten and stoned, while undesirable members of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine are subject to mass intimidation and local officials see their families and children targeted by death threats if they do not support the installation of this new political power. The new Ukrainian authorities are massively burning the offices of political parties they do not like, and have publicly announced the threat of criminal prosecution and prohibition of political parties and public organizations that do not share the ideology and goals of the new regime.” (“USA and EU Are Erecting a Nazi Regime on Ukrainian Territory”, Natalia Vitrenko)</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the week, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that a Ukranian synagogue had been firebombed although the “Molotov cocktails struck the synagogue’s exterior stone walls and caused little damage”.</p>
<p>Another article in Haaretz referred to recent developments as “the new dilemma for Jews in Ukraine”. Here’s an excerpt from the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The greatest worry now is not the uptick in anti-Semitic incidents but the major presence of ultra-nationalist movements, especially the prominence of the Svoboda party and Pravy Sektor (right sector) members among the demonstrators. Many of them are calling their political opponents “Zhids” and flying flags with neo-Nazi symbols. There have also been reports, from reliable sources, of these movements distributing freshly translated editions of Mein Kampf and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in Independence Square.” (“Anti-Semitism, though a real threat, is being used by the Kremlin as a political football”,<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.576372">Haaretz</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there’s this, from Dr. Inna Rogatchi in Arutz Sheva:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is no secret concerning the real political agenda and programs of ultra-nationalist parties in Ukraine – there is nothing close to European values and goals there. One just should open existing documents and hear what the representatives of those parties proclaim daily. They are sharply anti-European, and highly racist. They have nothing to do with the values and practices of the civilized world…</p>
<p>Ukrainian Jewry is facing a real and serious threat….To empower the openly neo-Nazi movements in Europe by ignoring the threat they pose is an utterly risky business. People should not have to pay a terrible price – again – for the meekness and indifference of their leaders. As Ukraine today has become the tragic show-case for all of Europe with regards to breeding and allowing race-hatred to become a violent and uncontrollable force, it is impertive to handle the situation there in accordance with existing international law and norms of civilization.” (“<a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/14553#.Uw9ue8Kx7cu">Tea With Neo-Nazis: The Violent Nationalism in Ukraine</a>“, Arutz Sheva)</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a little more background on the topic by progressive analyst Stephen Lendmen from a February 25 post titled “New York Times: Supporting US Imperial Lawlessness”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Washington openly backs fascist Svoboda party leader Oleh Tyahnybok…In 2004, Tyahnybok was expelled from former President Viktor Yushchenko’s parliamentary faction. He was condemned for urging Ukrainians to fight against a “Muscovite-Jewish mafia.”</p>
<p>In 2005, he denounced “criminal activities” of “organized Jewry.” He outrageously claimed they plan “genocide” against Ukrainians.”…</p>
<p>Tyahnybok extremism didn’t deter Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland. On February 6, she met openly with him and other anti-government leaders.</p>
<p>In early January, 15,000 ultranationalists held a torchlight march through Kiev. They did so to honor Nazi-era collaborator/mass murderer Stepan Bandera. Some wore uniforms a Wehrmacht Ukrainian division used in WW II. Others chanted “Ukraine above all” and “Bandera, come and bring order.” (Steve Lendman blog)</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the US media has downplayed the fascistic-neo-Nazi “ethnic purity” element of the Ukrainian coup in order to focus on– what they think — are more “positive themes”, like the knocking down of statues of Lenin or banning Communist party members from participating in Parliament. As far as the media is concerned, these are all signs of progress.</p>
<p>Ukraine is gradually succumbing to the loving embrace of the New World Order where it will serve as another profit-generating cog in Wall Street’s wheel. That’s the theory, at least. It hasn’t occurred to the boneheads at the New York Times or Washington Post that Ukraine is rapidly descending into Mad Max-type anarchy which could spill over its borders into neighboring countries triggering violent conflagrations, social upheaval, regional instability or–god-help-us– WW3. The MSM sees nothing but silver linings as if everything was going according to plan. All of Eurasia, the Middle East and beyond are being pacified and integrated into one world government overseen by the unitary executive who defers to no one but the corporations and financial institutions who control the levers of power behind imperial shoji-screen. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Naturally, Russia is worried about developments in Ukraine, but is unsure how to react. Here’s how Russian PM Dmitry Medvedev summed it up the other day:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We do not understand what is going on there. A real threat to our interests (exists) and to the lives and health of our citizens. Strictly speaking, today there is no one there to communicate with … If you think that people in black masks waving Kalashnikovs (represent) a government, then it will be difficult for us to work with such a government.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, Moscow is confused and worried. No one expects the world’s only superpower to behave this irrationally, to hop-scotch across the planet creating one failed state after another, fomenting revolt, breeding hatred, and spreading misery wherever it goes. At present, the Obama team is operating at full-throttle trying to topple regimes in Syria, Venezuela, Ukraine, and god-knows where else. At the same time, failed operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya have left all three countries in dire straights, ruled by regional warlords and armed militias. Medvedev has every right to be concerned.</p>
<p>Who wouldn’t be? The US has gone off the rails, stark raving mad. The architecture for global security has collapsed while the basic principals of international law have been jettisoned. The rampaging US juggernaut lurches from one violent confrontation to the next without rhyme or reason, destroying everything in its path, forcing millions to flee their own countries, and pushing the world closer to the abyss. Isn’t that reason enough to be concerned?</p>
<p>Now Obama has thrown-in with the Nazis. It’s just the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Check out this blurb from Max Blumenthal’s latest titled “Is the U.S. Backing Neo-Nazis in Ukraine?”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Right Sector is a shadowy syndicate of self-described ‘autonomous nationalists’ identified by their skinhead style of dress, ascetic lifestyle, and fascination with street violence. Armed with riot shields and clubs, the group’s cadres have manned the front lines of the Euromaidan battles this month, filling the air with their signature chant: ‘Ukraine above all!’ In a recent Right Sector propaganda video the group promised to fight ‘against degeneration and totalitarian liberalism, for traditional national morality and family values.’</p>
<p>With Svoboda linked to a constellation of international neo-fascist parties through the Alliance of European National Movements, Right Sector is promising to lead its army of aimless, disillusioned young men on “a great European Reconquest.” (“<a href="http://www.alternet.org/tea-party-and-right/us-backing-neo-nazis-ukraine?page=0%2C2">Is the U.S. Backing Neo-Nazis in Ukraine?—Exposing troubling ties in the U.S. to overt Nazi and fascist protesters in Ukraine</a>“, Max Blumenthal, AlterNet)</p></blockquote>
<p>“Family values”? Where have we heard that before?</p>
<p>It’s clear, that Obama and his brainiac advisors think they have a handle on this thing and can train this den of vipers to click their heels and follow Washington’s directives, but it sounds like a bad bet to me. These are hard-core, died-in-the-wool, Nazi-extremists. They won’t be bought-off, co-opted or intimidated. They have an agenda and they aim to pursue that agenda to their last, dying breath.</p>
<p>Of all the dumb plans Washington has come up with in the couple years, this is the dumbest.</p>

			<p>I am a great fan of Kiev, an affable city of pleasing bourgeois character, with its plentiful small restaurants, clean tree-lined streets, and bonhomie of its beer gardens. A hundred years ago Kiev was predominantly a Russian resort, and some central areas have retained this flavour. Now Kiev is patrolled by armed thugs from the Western Ukraine, by fighters from the neo-Nazi -Right Sector, descendants of Stepan Bandera, the Ukrainian Quisling’s troopers, and by their local comrades-in-arms of nationalist persuasion.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.israelshamir.net/English/BrownRevolution.jpg" width="586" /></p>
<p>After a month of confrontation, President Viktor Yanukovych gave in, signed the EC-prepared surrender and escaped their rough revolutionary justice by the skin of his teeth. The ruling party MPs were beaten and dispersed, the communists almost lynched, the opposition have the parliament all to themselves, and they&#8217;ve  appointed new ministers and taken over the Ukraine. The Brown Revolution has won in the Ukraine. This big East European country of fifty million inhabitants has gone the way of Libya. The US and the EU won this round, and pushed Russia back eastwards, just as they intended.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the neo-Nazi thugs who won the battle will agree to surrender the sweet fruits of victory to politicians, who are, God knows, nasty enough. And more importantly, it remains to be seen whether the Russian-speaking East and South East of the country will accept the Brown rule of Kiev, or  split off and go their own way, as the people of Israel (so relates the Bible) after King Solomon’s death rebelled against his heir saying “To your tents, o Israel!” and proclaimed independence of their fief (I Kings 12:16). Meanwhile it seems that the Easterners’ desire to preserve Ukrainian state integrity is stronger than their dislike for the victorious Browns. Though they assembled their representatives for what could be a declaration of independence, they did not dare to claim power. These peaceful people have little stamina for strife.</p>
<p>Their great neighbour, Russia, does not appear overtly concerned with this ominous development. Both Russian news agencies, TASS and RIA, didn’t even place the dire Ukrainian news at the top, as Reuters and BBC did: for them, the Olympics and the biathlon were of greater importance.</p>
<p>This “ostrich” attitude is quite typical of the Russian media: whenever they find themselves in an embarrassing position, they escape into showing the Swan Lake ballet on TV. That&#8217;s what they did when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. This time it was the Olympics instead of the ballet.</p>
<p>Anti-Putin opposition in Russia heartily approved of the Ukrainian coup.<i>Yesterday Kiev, tomorrow Moscow</i>, they chanted. <i>Maidan</i> (the main square of Kiev, the site of anti-government demos) <i>equals Bolotnaya</i> (a square in Moscow, the site of anti-government protests in December 2012) is another popular slogan.</p>
<p>The majority of Russians were upset but not surprised. Russia decided to minimise its involvement in the Ukraine some weeks ago as if they wished to demonstrate to the world their non-interference. Their behaviour bordered on recklessness. While foreign ministers of EC countries and their allies crowded Kiev, Putin sent Vladimir Lukin, a human rights emissary, an elder low-level politician of very little clout, to deal with the Ukrainian crisis. The Russian Ambassador Mr Zurabov, another non-entity, completely disappeared from public view. (Now he was recalled to Moscow). Putin  made not a single public statement on the Ukraine, treating it as though it were Libya or Mali, not a neighbouring country quite close to the Russian hinterland.</p>
<p>This hands-off approach could have been expected: Russia did not interfere in the disastrous Ukrainian elections 2004, or in the Georgian elections that produced extremely anti-Russian governments. Russia gets involved only if there is a real battle on the ground, and a legitimate government asks for help, as in Ossetia in 2008 or in Syria in 2011. Russia supports those who fight for their cause, otherwise Russia, somewhat disappointingly, stands aside.</p>
<p>The West has no such inhibitions and its representatives were extremely active: the US State Department representative Victoria “Fuck EC’’ Nuland had spent days and weeks in Kiev, feeding the insurgents with cookies, delivering millions of smuggled greenbacks to them, meeting with their leaders, planning and plotting the coup. Kiev is awash with the newest US dollars fresh from its mint (of a kind yet unseen in Moscow, I’ve been told by Russian friends). The US embassy spread money around like a tipsy Texan in a night club. Every able-bodied young man willing to fight received five hundred dollar a week, a qualified fighter – up to a thousand, a platoon commander had two thousand dollars – good money by Ukrainian standards.</p>
<p>Money is not all. People are also needed for a successful coup. There was an opposition to Yanukovych who won democratic elections, and accordingly, three parties lost elections. Supporters of the three parties could field a lot of people for a peaceful demonstration, or for a sit-in. But would they fight when push comes to shove? Probably not. Ditto the recipients of generous US and EC grants (Nuland <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=861DJLR4Cek&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D861DJLR4Cek&amp;app=desktop">estimated</a> the total sum of American investment in “democracy building” at five billion dollars). They could be called to come to the main square for a demo. However, the NGO beneficiaries are timid folk, not likely to risk their well-being. And the US needed a better fighting stock to remove the democratically elected president from power.</p>
<p><b>Serpent Eggs</b></p>
<p>In the Western Ukraine, the serpent eggs hatched: children of Nazi collaborators who had imbibed hatred towards the Russians with their mothers’ milk. Their fathers had formed a network under Reinhard Gehlen, the German spymaster. In 1945, as Germany was defeated, Gehlen swore allegiance to the US and delivered his networks to the CIA. They continued their guerrilla war against the Soviets until 1956. Their cruelty was legendary, for they aimed to terrify the population into full compliance to their command. Notoriously, they strangulated the Ukrainians suspected of being friendly to Russians with their bare hands.</p>
<p>A horrifying <a href="http://gubarev.org/istoriya/ispoved-byvshej-banderovki.html">confession of a participant</a> tells of their activities in Volyn: “One night, we strangulated 84 men. We strangulated adults, as for little kids, we held their legs, swung and broke their heads at a doorpost. …Two nice kids, Stepa and Olya, 12 and 14 years old… we tore the younger one into two parts, and there was no need to strangulate her mother Julia, she died of a heart attack” and so on and so on. They slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Poles and Jews; even the dreadful Baby Yar massacre was done by them, with German connivance, somewhat similar to Israeli connivance in the Sabra and Chatila massacres of Palestinians by the Lebanese fascists of the Phalange.</p>
<p>The children of these Bandera murderers were brought up to hate Communism,  Soviets and Russians, and in adoration of their fathers’ deeds. They formed the spearhead of the pro-US anti-government rebels in the Ukraine, the Right Sector led by out-and-out fascist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDDC0lDxinY#t=171">Dmytro Yarosh</a>. They were ready to fight, to die and kill. Such units attract potential rebels of differing backgrounds: their spokesman is young Russian -turned -Ukrainian -nationalist Artem Skoropadsky, a journalist with the mainstream oligarch-owned <i>Kommersant-UA</i> daily. There are similar young Russians who join Salafi networks and become suicide-bombers in the Caucasus mountains – young people whose desire for action and sacrifice could not be satisfied in the consumer society. This is a Slav al-Qaeda &#8212; real neo-Nazi storm troopers, a natural ally of the US.</p>
<p>And they did not fight only for association with EC and against joining a Russia-led TC. Their enemies were also the Russians in the Ukraine, and Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainians. The difference between the twain is moot. Before independence in 1991, some three quarters of the population preferred to speak Russian. Since then, successive governments have tried to force people to use Ukrainian. For the Ukrainian neo-Nazis, anyone who speaks Russian is an enemy. You can compare this with Scotland, where people speak English, and nationalists would like to force them to speak the language of Burns.</p>
<p>Behind the spearhead of the Right Sector, with its fervent anti-communist and anti-Russian fighters, a larger organisation could be counted on: the neo-Nazi Freedom (Svoboda), of Tyagnibok. Some years ago Tyagnibok<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FYAXIobvJBs">called</a> for a fight against Russians and Jews, now he has become more cautious regarding the Jews. He is still as anti-Russian as John Foster Dulles. Tyagnibok was tolerated or even encouraged by Yanukovych, who wanted to take a leaf from the French president Jacques Chirac’s book. Chirac won the second round of elections against nationalist Le Pen, while probably he would have lost against any other opponent. In the same wise, Yanukovych wished Tyagnibok to become his defeatable opponent at the second round of presidential elections.</p>
<p>The parliamentary parties (the biggest one is the party of Julia Timoshenko with 25% of seats, the smaller one was the party of Klitschko the boxer with 15%) would support the turmoil as a way to gain power they lost at the elections.</p>
<p><b>Union of nationalists and liberals</b></p>
<p>Thus, <b>a union of nationalists and liberals</b> was formed. This union is the trademark of a new US policy in the Eastern Europe. It was tried in Russia two years ago, where enemies of Putin comprise of these two forces, of pro-Western liberals and of their new allies, Russian ethnic nationalists, soft and hard neo-Nazis. The liberals won’t fight, they are unpopular with the masses; they include an above-average percentage of Jews, gays, millionaires and liberal columnists; the nationalists can incite the great unwashed masses almost as well as the Bolsheviks, and will fight. This is the anti-Putin cocktail preferred by the US. This alliance actually took over 20% of vote in Moscow city elections, after their attempt to seize power by coup was beaten off by Putin. The Ukraine is their second, successful joint action.</p>
<p>Bear in mind: liberals do not have to support democracy. They do so only if they are certain democracy will deliver what they want. Otherwise, they can join forces with al Qaeda as now in Syria, with Islamic extremists as in Libya, with the Army as in Egypt, or with neo-Nazis, as now in Russia and the Ukraine. Historically, the liberal–Nazi alliance did not work because the old Nazis were enemies of bankers and financial capital, and therefore anti-Jewish. This hitch could be avoided: Mussolini was friendly to Jews and had a few Jewish ministers in his government; he objected to Hitler’s anti-Jewish attitude saying that “Jews are useful and friendly”. Hitler replied that if he were to allow that, thousands of Jews would join his party. Nowadays, this problem has vanished: modern neo-Nazis are friendly towards Jews, bankers and gays. The Norwegian killer Breivik is an exemplary sample of a Jew-friendly neo-Nazi. So are the Ukrainian and Russian neo-Nazis.</p>
<p>While the original Bandera thugs killed every Jew (and Pole) that came their way, their modern heirs receive some valuable Jewish support. The oligarchs of Jewish origin (Kolomoysky, Pinchuk and Poroshenko) financed them, while a prominent Jewish leader, Chairman of the Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities of the Ukraine, <a href="http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/biography/122">Josef Zissels</a>, supported them and justified them. There are many supporters of Bandera in Israel; they usually claim that Bandera was not an anti-Semite, as he had a Jewish doctor. (So did Hitler.) Jews do not mind Nazis who do not target them. The Russian neo-Nazis target Tajik gastarbeiters, and the Ukrainian neo-Nazis target Russian-speakers.</p>
<p><b>Revolution: the Outline</b></p>
<p>The revolution deserves to be described in a few lines: Yanukovych was not too bad a president, prudent though weak. Still the Ukraine came to the edge of financial abyss. (You can read more about it in my previous <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/20/what-really-happened-in-ukraine/">piece</a>) He tried to save the situation by allying with the EC, but the EC had no money to spare. Then he tried to make a deal with Russia, and Putin offered him a way out, without even demanding from him that the Ukraine join the Russian-led TC. This triggered the violent response of the EC and the US, as they were worried it would strengthen Russia.</p>
<p>Yanuk, as people call him for short, had few friends. Powerful Ukrainian oligarchs weren’t enamoured with him. Besides the usual reasons, they did not like the raider habits of Yanuk’s son, who would steal other men’s businesses. Here they may have had a point, for the leader of Belarus, the doughty Lukashenko, said that Yanuk’s son’s unorthodox ways of acquiring businesses brought disaster.</p>
<p>Yanuk’s electorate, the Russian-speaking people of the Ukraine (and they are a majority in the land, like English-speaking Scots are majority in Scotland) were disappointed with him because he did not give them the right to speak Russian and teach their children in Russian. The followers of Julia Timoshenko disliked him for jailing their leader. (She richly deserved it: she hired assassins, stole billions of Ukrainian state money in cahoots with a former prime minister, made a crooked deal with Gazprom at the expense of Ukrainian consumers, and what not.) Extreme nationalists hated him for not eradicating the Russian language.</p>
<p>The US-orchestrated attack on the elected President followed <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/your-democracy/2013/01/machiavelli-non-violence">Gene Sharp</a>’s instructions to a tee, namely: (1) seize a central square and organise a mass peaceful sit-in, (2) speak endlessly of danger of violent dispersal, (3) if the authorities do nothing, provoke bloodshed, (4) yell bloody murder, (5) the authority is horrified and stupefied and (6) removed and (7) new powers take over.</p>
<p>The most important element of the scheme has never been voiced by the cunning Sharp, and that is why the Occupy Wall Street movement (who thumbed through the book) failed to achieve the desired result. You have to have the Masters of Discourse™ i.e., Western mainstream media, on your side. Otherwise, the government will squash you as they did with the Occupy and many other similar movements. But here, the Western media was fully on the rebels’ side, for the events were organised by the US embassy.</p>
<p>At first, they gathered for a sit-in on the Independence Square (aka “Maidan Square”) some people they knew: recipients of USAID grants via the NGO network, <a href="http://alternatio.org/articles/articles/item/15135-%C3%B0%C3%A0%C3%B1%C3%AF%C3%A0%C3%A4-%C3%B1%C3%AC%C3%BB%C3%B1%C3%AB%C3%BB-%C3%AC%C3%A0%C3%A9%C3%A4%C3%A0%C3%AD%C3%A0-%E2%80%93-1">wrote</a> a Ukrainian expert Andrey Vajra, networks of fugitive oligarch Khoroshkovski, neo-Nazis of the Right Sector and radicals of the Common Cause. The peaceful assembly was lavishly entertained by artists; food and drink were served for free, free sex was encouraged – it was a carnival in the centre of the capital, and it began to attract the masses, as would happen in every city in the known universe. This carnival was paid for by the oligarchs and by the US embassy.</p>
<p>But the carnival could not last forever. As per (2), rumours of violent dispersal were spread. People became scared and drifted away. Only a small crowd of activists remained on the square. Provocation as per (3) was supplied by a Western agent within the administration, Mr Sergey Levochkin. He wrote his resignation letter, posted it and ordered police to violently disperse the sit-in. Police moved in and dispersed the activists. Nobody was killed, nobody was seriously wounded, &#8211; today, after a hundredfold dead, it is ridiculous even to mention this thrashing, &#8211; but the opposition yelled bloody murder at the time. The world media, this powerful tool in the hands of Masters of Discourse, decried “Yanukovych massacred children”. The EC and the US slapped on sanctions, foreign diplomats moved in, all claiming they want to protect peaceful demonstrators, while at the same time beefing up the Maidan crowd with armed gunmen and Right Sector fighters.</p>
<p>We referred to Gene Sharp, but the Maidan had an additional influence, that of Guy Debord and his concept of <a href="http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/debord/">Society of Spectacle</a>. It was not a real thing, but a well-done make-believe, as was its predecessor, the August 1991 Moscow “coup”. Yanukovych did everything to build up the Maidan resistance: he would send his riot police to disperse the crowd, and after they did only half of the job, he would call them back, and he did this every day. After such  treatment, even a very placid dog would bite.</p>
<p>The Spectacle-like unreal quality of Kiev events was emphasized by arrival of the imperial warmonger, the neocon philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy. He came to Maidan like he came to Libya and Bosnia, claiming human rights and threatening sanctions and bombing. Whenever he comes, war is following. I hope I shall be away from every country he plans to visit.</p>
<p>First victims of the Brown Revolution were the monuments – those of Lenin, for they do hate communism in every form, and those of the world war, because the revolutionaries solidarise with the lost side, with the German Nazis.</p>
<p>History will tell us to what extent Yanuk and his advisors understood what they were doing. Anyway, he encouraged the fire of Maidan by his inefficient raids by a weaponless police force. The neo-Nazis of Maidan used snipers against the police force, dozens of people were killed, but President Obama called upon Yanuk to desist, and he desisted. After renewed shooting, he would send the police in again. An EC diplomat would threaten him with the Hague tribunal dock, and he would call his police back. No government could function in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Eventually he collapsed, signed on the dotted line and departed for unknown destination. The rebels seized power, forbade the Russian language and began sacking Kiev and Lvov. Now the life of the placid people of Kiev has been turned into a living hell: daily robberies, beating, murder abound. The victors are preparing a military operation against the Russian-speaking areas in the South East of Ukraine. The spectacle of the revolution can yet turn really bloody.</p>
<p>Some Ukrainians hope that Julia Timoshenko, freshly released from jail, will be able to rein the rebels in. Others hope that President Putin will pay heed to the Ukrainian events, now that his Olympic games are, mercifully, finished. The spectacle is not over until the fat lady sings, but sing she will – her song still remains to be seen and heard.</p>

<p align="left">Public opinion in Western Europe is wrong to regard the Ukrainian crisis as a showdown between Westerners and Russians. In reality, Washington’s goal is not to push the country into the arms of the European Union, but to deprive Russia of its historical partners. To do this, the United States is prepared to ignite a new civil war on the continent.</p>
<p>After having dismembered Yugoslavia during a ten-year civil war (1990-1999), has the United States decided to destroy Ukraine in a similar way? This is what could be inferred from the maneuvers that the opposition is poised to launch during the Sochi Olympic Games.</p>
<p align="left">Ukraine has been historically divided between, in the West, a population turned towards the European Union and, in the East, a population oriented towards Russia, plus a small Muslim minority in Crimea. After the country‘s independence, the government gradually crumbled. Taking advantage of the confusion, the United States organized the «Orange Revolution» (2004) [<a id="nh1" title="&quot;Washington et Moscou se livrent bataille en Ukraine&quot;, by Emilia Nazarenko (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb1" rel="footnote">1</a>], which brought to power a mafia clan, also pro-Atlanticist. Moscow responded by lifting its subsidies on gas prices, but the Orange government could not rely on its Western allies to help pay the market price. Ultimately, it lost the 2010 presidential election in favor of Viktor Yanukovych, a corrupt politician, and on again-off again pro-Russian.</p>
<p align="left">On 21 November 2013, the government renounces signing the Association Agreement negotiated with the European Union. The opposition responds with protests in Kiev and in the western part of the country, which quickly take on an insurrectionary appearance. It calls for early presidential and parliamentary elections and refuses to form a government when approached by President Yanukovych and the Prime Minister resigns. The events are baptized Euromaidan, then Eurorevolution, by Radio Free Europe (run by the State Department).</p>
<p align="left">The crowd control for the opposition is provided by Azatlyk, a group of young Crimean Tatars who returned from Jihad in Syria especially for the occasion [<a id="nh2" title="“Jihadists in charge of crowd control in Kiev protests”, Translation Alizée (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb2" rel="footnote">2</a>].</p>
<p align="left">The Atlanticist media champion the cause of the «democratic opposition» and condemn Russian influence. High-profile Western figures turn up to manifest their support to the protesters, including Victoria Nuland (Assistant Secretary of State and former Ambassador to NATO) and John McCain (Chairman of the Republican branch of the NED). For its part, the Russian press condemns protesters who have taken to the streets to overthrow democratically elected institutions.</p>
<p align="left"><em>Torch-lit march of 15,000 Nazis in Kiev on 1 January 2014.</em></p>
<p><iframe name="I1" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AthFgiD1_pU" height="400" width="582" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p align="left">At first, the movement seemed to be an attempt to orchestrate a second «Orange Revolution.» But on 1 January 2014 the power in the street changes hands. The Nazi «Freedom» party organizes a 15 000-strong torch-lit march in memory of Stepan Bandera (1909-1959), the nationalist leader who allied himself with the Nazis against the Soviets. Since this event, the capital has been covered with anti-Semitic graffiti and people are attacked on the street for being Jewish.</p>
<p align="left">The pro-European opposition is made up of three political parties:</p>
<ul>
<li> The All-Ukrainian Union &#8220;Fatherland&#8221; (Batkivshchyna), led by the oligarch and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko (serving a prison sentence following her convictions for embezzlement) and currently headed by lawyer and former Parliament speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk. It stands for private property and the Western liberal model. It garnered 25.57% of the vote in the 2012 parliamentary elections.</li>
<li> The Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (Udar), of former boxing world champion Vitali Klitschko. It claims to identify with Christian Democracy and picked up 13.98% in the 2012 elections.</li>
<li> The All-Ukrainian Union &#8220;Svoboda&#8221; (Freedom), led by the surgeon Oleh Tyahnybok. This political group sprang from the National Socialist Party of Ukraine. It promotes the denaturalization of Jewish Ukrainians. It won 10.45% of the vote in the 2012 parliamentary elections.</li>
<p>These parliamentary parties have the support of:</p>
<li> The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, a Nazi splinter group from the former NATO stay-behind networks in the Eastern Bloc [<a id="nh3" title="This is the cesspool that the father of the &quot;Orange revolution&quot; alighted (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb3" rel="footnote">3</a>]. A Zionist, he calls for the denaturalization and deportation of Ukrainian Jews to Israel. He received 1.11% of the vote in 2012.</li>
<li> The Ukrainian Self-Defense, a nationalist splinter group that sent its members to fight the Russians in Chechnya and Ossetia during the Georgian conflict. It got 0.08% of the vote in 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In addition, the opposition has received the endorsement of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, in revolt against the Moscow Patriarchate. Ever since the Nazi Party took over the streets, the demonstrators &#8211; many of them wearing helmets and dressed in paramilitary uniforms -have erected barricades and stormed government buildings. Certain elements of the police force have also displayed great brutality, going so far as to torture detainees. A dozen protesters were killed and nearly 2,000 were wounded. The unrest spread to the western provinces of the country.</p>
<p align="left">According to our information, the Ukrainian opposition seeks to import military materials acquired on parallel markets. It is obviously not possible to purchase weapons in Western Europe and bring them in without NATO’s green light.</p>
<p align="left">Washington’s strategy in Ukraine would appear to be a combination of proven &#8220;color revolution&#8221; recipes with others recently concocted during the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; [<a id="nh4" title="“Coup in Western Ukraine: the Arab Spring unleashed in Europe”, by Andrew (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb4" rel="footnote">4</a>]. Moreover, the United States makes no effort to hide it: it dispatched two officials, Victoria Nuland (deputy to John Kerry) and John McCain (who is not only a Republican senator, but also the chairman of IRI, the Republican branch of the NED [<a id="nh5" title="&quot;La NED, vitrine légale de la CIA&quot;, by Thierry Meyssan, Odnako/Réseau (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb5" rel="footnote">5</a>]) to support the protesters. Unlike Libya and Syria, Washington does not have jihadists on hand to sow chaos (except for Tatar extremists, but they are only located in Crimea). It was therefore decided to lean on the Nazis with whom the State Department worked against the Soviets and has organized in political parties since independence.</p>
<p align="left">The inexperienced reader may be taken aback by this alliance between the Obama administration and the Nazis. However, it must be remembered that Ukrainian Nazis were publicly honored at the White House by President Reagan, including Yaroslav Stetsko, Ukrainian Prime Minister under the Third Reich, who became the head of the anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations and a member of the World anti-Communist League [<a id="nh6" title="&quot;La Ligue anti-communiste mondiale, une internationale du crime&quot;, by (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb6" rel="footnote">6</a>]. One of his deputies, Lev Dobriansky, became U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, while his daughter Paula Dobriansky served as Under Secretary of State for Democracy (sic) during the George W. Bush administration. It is the same Ms. Dobriansky who for ten years sponsored a historical research with the aim of clouding the fact that the Holodomor, the famine that hit Ukraine in 1932-33, also devastated Russia and Kazakhstan, thereby reinforcing the myth that Stalin was determined to eliminate the Ukrainian people [<a id="nh7" title="See: L’Holodomor, nouvel avatar de l’anticommunisme « européen », by Professor (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb7" rel="footnote">7</a>].</p>
<p align="left">In fact, Washington, who had supported the German Nazi party until 1939 and continued to do business with Nazi Germany until the end of 1941, never had a moral problem with Nazism, not more than it has today in providing military support to jihadism in Syria.</p>
<p align="left">Western European elites, who use Nazism as a pretext to harass firebrands &#8211; as seen with the „quenelle“ controversy over French comedien Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala [<a id="nh8" title="“The Bête Noire of the French Establishment”, by Diana Johnstone, (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb8" rel="footnote">8</a>] &#8211; have forgotten what it really is. In 2005, they closed their eyes to the rehabilitation of Nazism by the President of Latvia, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, as if it were trivial [<a id="nh9" title="“Latvian President Rehabilitates Nazism”, by Thierry Meyssan, Voltaire (...)" href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article182188.html#nb9" rel="footnote">9</a>]. On the simple strength of statements in favor of the European Union, and wrapped up in their blissful Atlanticism, they now support their worst enemy. Civil war could start in Ukraine during the Olympic Games in Sochi.</p>

<p>If you really want to understand the world we are living in, you better stick with the Zionist media. The Jerusalem Post will provide you with the names of the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-Features/Forbes-ranking-The-worlds-richest-Jews-310104">Jews who own the planet</a>. The British Jewish Chronicle will teach you about arch pedophile <a href="http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/57682/jimmy-savile-came-my-batmitzvah">Jimmy Seville’s ties with Israel</a>.  <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/haunted-by-ghosts-1.319263">Haaretz</a> will even let me speak about all those topics <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/09/28/the-dangerous-cult-of-the-guardian/">The Guardian (Of Zion</a>) is there to shamelessly suppress.</p>
<p>Yesterday I came across a text by <a href="http://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/the-unwelcome-arrival-of-the-quenelle">Dave Rich</a>, a Hasbara mouthpiece operating within the UK ultra-Zionist Community Security Trust. Rich suggested that making a common cause “between Holocaust deniers, neo-fascists, the pro-Palestinian left, and the revolutionary Islamists of Iran is precisely what Dieudonné has spent the past decade trying to achieve.”</p>
<p>Let us admit it, no one could have been more succinct and precise in analysing Dieudonné’s vast impact. Yet in order to fully understand Rich’s statement we’ll have to decode the kosher sound bites and rewrite the above sentence using terminology that may resemble a familiar language.</p>
<p><strong>Holocaust deniers</strong> – In the real world there are no ‘Holocaust deniers’: what we have instead are history revisionists – people who understand that the making of history, is a continuous attempt to narrate the past as we move along. The so-called revisionists re-visit, re-write and revise the past. Those whom Zionists and progressives often tag as ‘Holocaust deniers’ are often enough the last <strong>True Historians</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Neo-Fascists and Fascists</strong> – Zionists and Progressives tend to attach the ‘Fascist’ label to those who refuse to surrender to the tyranny of political correctness. Those few people who insist to say what they think against all odds. Thus, those whom the Zionists call ‘Fascists’ are in practice merely a bunch of <strong>Authentic People.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pro-Palestinian Left</strong> – points in the direction of the last pockets of resistance to Kosher indoctrination within the Left, namely, those few resilient subjects and organisations that say NO to George Soros’ funding. Rich is basically referring here to the <strong>Genuine Left, </strong>people and organisations that are committed to Labour, working class politics and solidarity, as opposed to Identity politics spin.</p>
<p><strong>Revolutionary Islamists of Iran</strong> – is the tag Zionists and progressives often attach to <strong>Proper Resistance</strong> &#8211; those Muslims who won’t work for Israel, not even in the spring.</p>
<p>Now that we are familiar with the basic Zionist glossary we are ready to translate Rich’s statement into proper English.</p>
<p>By suggesting that Dieudonné is articulating a common cause  for “Holocaust deniers, neo-fascists, the pro-Palestinian left, and the revolutionary Islamists of Iran” Rich actually admits that Dieudonné has managed to unite the <strong>True Historians, Authentic People, Genuine Left and the Proper Resistance.</strong></p>
<p>In case someone fails to realize it, what Rich is describing here is the true dissidence, an uncompromised league of people that forms the <strong>un-controlled opposition</strong>: those people and institutions that do not subscribe to Zionist hegemony funded by Soros and his ilk.</p>
<p>It is not a secret that the Zionists and Left are in a state of panic, and for a good reason. The ‘anti-quenelle’ campaign that was supposed to ruin Dieudonné’s career backfired colossally. Pretty much when it seemed as if the French people had been Zionised by means of ‘correctness’ and were stripped of their revolutionary inclinations, a tsunami of resentment towards kosher socialism and Jewish political power swept the ground. They panicked and struck back hard. But you cannot fight a tsunami with a boomerang.</p>
<p>Dieudonné’s ‘quenelle’ is already a monumental development in the history of the Jews and their stooges within the Left and the media.</p>

<p>What does it take, in an era dominated by progressive identity politics, to be accepted as a fully qualified member of the Left?</p>
<p>Jane is a London lawyer who identifies politically ‘as a woman,’ and marches enthusiastically for human rights. Can she join? I think the answer is yes, she can.</p>
<p>George is a medical doctor who happens also to be a black man and identifies as ‘Black middle class.’ Can he subscribe to a progressive email group and contribute to the discussion? I hope and suspect that he can.</p>
<p>And what about Julie? She runs an estate agency on the posh side of town but she also identifies as a &#8216;gay lesbian,’ can she join the parade? What a question! Of course she can.</p>
<p>Now Abe is an accountant and very attached to his Jewish heritage. Abe identifies as a &#8216;secular Jew,’ can he join the anti-war movement? More than likely he can, in fact he may even, within hours of his joining, find himself in a position of leadership.</p>
<p>But what about Hammed, a metal worker from Birmingham? Hammed identifies as a &#8216;Muslim’ &#8212; can he join a Left demonstration against the War in Syria? It’s a good question and the answer is not immediately obvious at all because it’s no secret that many of those who subscribe to ‘progressive’ ideology and indeed, activism, are rather troubled by religion in general and Islam in particular.</p>
<p>So, while Hammed is identifying with a universal and humanist precept, Jane, ‘the woman’, Julie ‘the Gay Lesbian’ and George ‘the Black’ openly subscribe to biologically-determined political identities. Furthermore, Abe, Identifying as a secular Jew, affiliates himself with a blood-based ethnocentric tribal identity. Clearly, the Left has no problem with such marginal and exclusivist political identities.</p>
<p>So, how is it possible that the contemporary Left discourse is sustained by people who, themselves subscribe to biologically-determined identity politics, yet so often reject similar, though often working class folk, who actually support equality and human rights issues? Could it be that the Left has in fact, drifted away from working class politics into some vague and inconsistent pseudo-empathic discourse primarily engaged in sectarian battles?</p>
<p>And there’s more.</p>
<p>Uri is an Israeli peace activist and writer who also identifies as an Israeli Leftist. Is Uri welcome within the progressive network? The answer is unreservedly, yes. But John Smith, an English bus driver from Liverpool is proud to be English and ‘as an Englishman’ he opposes the war because John actually believes that peace is patriotic. Can he join an anti-war protest and, while he’s at it, carry a Union Jack to demonstrations? I leave the answer to you.</p>
<p>Tony is a &#8216;Jewish Socialist’ &#8211; certainly not religious but an ethnic Jew who identifies ‘as a Jew’ racially and ethnically. And by the way, Tony also operates politically within Jews-only anti-Zionist groups. Now Tony is hugely welcome at most Left and progressive gathering. But can the same be said for Franz who identifies as an ‘Aryan socialist’? Again, I leave the answer to you.</p>
<p>The point is that yet again we detect a critical discrepancy in Left or progressive thinking. While Jewish ethnocentrism and even Jewish racial exclusivity is accepted, other forms of ethnocentrism are bluntly rejected. Is this a contradiction? You judge.</p>
<p>And, while we’re at it, what about Laura? She’s a Muslim convert who often hides her face behind the veil. Does she feel comfortable in ‘progressive’ gatherings? Not really. But Laura certainly supports human rights and equality almost as much as she loves Allah. But the Left’s  and progressives’ tolerance towards Allah worshippers is particularly limited while, on the other hand,  worshippers of the Talmud who are willing to oppose Israel are, not only tolerated, they are positively welcomed. Torah Jews, for instance, are often invited to progressive gatherings though, it must be said, they also encounter some resentment, especially from Jewish activists (This surely is because progressive Jews don’t like to be associated with people in caftans).</p>
<p>So it seems that membership of a progressive club is no straightforward matter because here we are here dealing with a discourse that is far from being open or inclusive. On the contrary, it is a pretty selective operation and far from being principled, coherent or universal. No longer is it committed to ‘members’ of the ‘working class’ -  unless they first demonstrate adherence  to a predetermined tablet of  ‘correct politics’.</p>
<p>So what are these ‘correct politics’? Where are they defined and by whom?</p>
<p>In order to address this question we have to first delve into the peculiar ‘progressive’  threshold that leaves the Muslim and the nationalist out yet happily embraces other biologically-determined political, and even racial categories. Strangely enough, the mix that forms the Left alliance is suspiciously similar to the mix that sustains Liberal Zionist political power.</p>
<p>Is this a coincidence? Is it really that surprising that the Left, traditionally defined as a universal humanist discourse, is now supported politically and financially by a mixture of political identities that also lend their support to Israel and its rabidly nationalist, capitalist and ethnocentric ideology? No, it’s not, so I guess that the growing similarity between the Left and Liberal Zionism alliance demands some explanation. I’ve managed to come with three possible answers.</p>
<p>1.     The Spin – The similarity between the Liberal Zionist alliance and the Left compound is a complete coincidence and reveals nothing about either Zionism or Left ideology.</p>
<p>2.     The Observant – The Left and Liberal Zionism are basically two faces of the same coin.</p>
<p>3.     The Forensic – By following the money trail, we see that most Left groups and liberal Zionism (a la J-Street and practically the entire progressive network) are funded by the same organizations, leading amongst them being <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=1237">George Soros’ Open Society Institute.  </a></p>
<p>If the last is true (and I think it is) it may as well mean that a large part of the &#8216;dissident&#8217; network is sustained by&#8230;.wait for it&#8230; a Wall Street hedge fund. In other words we are dealing here with an institutional and well-funded controlled opposition apparatus. This may explain, what so often seems on the part of the Left and Progressive discourse generally, like complete dysfunction and utter impotence &#8211; whether in labour matters, domestic politics, foreign affairs, global wars and, of course, Palestine.</p>
<p>If the Left sees any reason to rescue itself &#8212; and this is indeed a big ‘if’ &#8211;  it would first have to redeem itself from its greed and attachment to ‘big money.’ It may have to redefine for itself exactly what labour and ‘working class politics’ means for the workless.</p>
<p>Of course, it may just be that the Left has ended its political and ideological role, that basically, it belongs to the past. In other words, our capacity to think universally and ethically is now completely liberated from dialectical materialism or class division.</p>
<p>In the end, I doubt whether anyone within the progressive network possesses the intellectual capacity and ideological stamina  to endure such a serious discussion.</p>
<p>I guess we’d just better move on.</p>

</div>
<p>Canada’s Conservative government is trying to convince Canadian Jews to support its right-wing imperialistic worldview.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently spoke to the annual Toronto gala of the Jewish National Fund, which has a long history of dispossessing Palestinians and discriminating against non-Jews.</p>
<p>Echoing the words of Theodor Herzl, a founder of political Zionism, Harper told the 4,000 attendees that Israel is a “light of freedom and democracy in what is otherwise a region of darkness.”</p>
<p>Shortly before this event the Minister for Employment and Social Development Jason Kenney spoke at the launch of the Canadian chapter of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI). Established by a former colonel in the Israeli military, MEMRI selectively (mis)translates stories from Arab and Iranian media in a bid to advance expansionist Israeli interests.</p>
<p>Kenney told the audience assembled at Montreal’s Shaar Hashomayim Synagogue that MEMRI is “a peaceful weapon of truth-telling in a civilizational conflict in which we are all engaged.”</p>
<p>The comments from Harper and Kenney certainly play well with those in the Jewish community committed to Israeli and Western imperialism, but they also spur that sentiment. Most people respect power and when leading politicians say a country is involved in a “civilizational conflict” against “a region of darkness” it tends to shape opinion.</p>
<p>Few Canadian Jews — or others among the target audience for that matter — realize that Harper and Kenney don’t take this “clash of civilizations” talk literally (if they did they wouldn’t be deepening political ties with a number of Middle Eastern monarchies and selling billions of dollars in weaponry to the region’s “darkest” regime, Saudi Arabia.)</p>
<p>While the Harper government’s pro-Israel comments are particularly extreme, they are far from unique in Canadian history. For more than a century non-Jewish Canadians have promoted a Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p>
<p>Similar to Europe, Zionism’s roots in Canada are Christian, not Jewish. Early Canadian support for Zionism was based on the more literal readings of the Bible that flowed out of the Protestant Reformation.</p>
<p>They were also tied to this country’s status as a dominion of the British Empire, which in the latter half of the nineteenth century began to see Zionism as a potential vehicle to strengthen its geostrategic position in the region.</p>
<p>At the time of confederation, Canada’s preeminent Christian Zionist was Henry Wentworth Monk. To buy Palestine from the Ottoman Empire in 1875, Monk began the Palestine Restoration Fund.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful, seven years later he took out an ad in the Jewish World proposing a “Bank of Israel” to finance Jewish resettlement. Irving Abella’s book A Coat of Many Colours: Two Centuries of Jewish Life in Canada describes Monk as “an eccentric but respected businessman” who took up a campaign in Canada and England to raise funds for buying land in Palestine during the 1870s and 1880s.</p>
<p>“In 1881 Monk even proposed setting up a Jewish National Fund,” Abella writes. “He issued manifestoes, wrote long articles, spoke to assorted meetings and lobbied extensively in England and Canada to realize his dream.”</p>
<p>Monk called for the British Empire to establish a “dominion of Israel” similar to the dominion of Canada. In the 1978 book Canada and Palestine, Zachariah Kay notes: “Monk believed that Palestine was the logical center of the British Empire, and could help form a confederation of the English-speaking world.”</p>
<p>Monk was not alone in Canada. Citing a mix of Christian and pro-British rationale, leading Canadian politicians repeatedly expressed support for Zionism. In 1907, two cabinet ministers attended the Federation of Zionist Societies of Canada convention, telling delegates that Zionism had the support of the government, according to Kay’s book.</p>
<p>Kay’s book also states that Arthur Meighen, then solicitor-general and later prime minister, proclaimed in November 1915: “I think I can speak for those of the Christian faith when I express the wish that God speed the day when the land of your forefathers shall be yours again. This task I hope will be performed by that champion of liberty the world over — the British Empire.”</p>
<p>The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which declared British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, boosted support for Zionism in this country. In the years thereafter, Canadian politicians of various stripes repeatedly urged Jews (and others) to support Zionism.</p>
<p>During a July 1922 speech to the Zionist Federation of Canada, the anti-Semitic Prime Minister Mackenzie King “was effusive with praise for Zionism,” explains David Bercuson in Canada and the Birth of Israel. King told participants their aspirations were “in consonance” with the greatest ideals of the “Englishman.”</p>
<p>A dozen years later, Prime Minister R.B. Bennett told a coast to-coast radio broadcast for the launch of the United Palestine Appeal fund drive that the Balfour Declaration and the British conquest of Palestine represented the beginning of the fulfillment of biblical prophecies.</p>
<p>According to a 1962 book by Canadian Zionist Bernard Figler, Bennett said, “When the promises of God, speaking through his prophets, are that the home will be restored in the homeland of their forefathers…Scriptural prophecy is being fulfilled. The restoration of Zion has begun.”</p>
<p>Jewish Zionism must be understood from within the political climate in which it operated. And Canada’s political culture clearly fostered Zionist ideals.</p>
<p>British imperialism, Christian Zionism and nationalist ideology were all part of this country’s political fabric. Additionally, in the early 1900s most Canadians did not find it odd that Europeans would take a “backward” people’s land, which is what settlers did to the indigenous population here.</p>
<p>A number of books about Canada’s Jewish community discuss how elite Canadian Jews, especially after the 1917 Balfour Declaration, were more active Zionists than their US counterparts. In Canada’s Jews: A People’s Journey, Gerald Tulchinsky explains: “The First World War accentuated differences between Canadian and American Jewry. For example, loyalty to Britain’s cause provided Zionists with opportunities to identify their purposes with Britain’s imperial mission.”</p>
<p>When British General Edmund Allenby led a campaign in late 1917 to take Palestine from the Ottomans as many as 400 Canadians (about half recruited specifically for the task) fought in Allenby’s Jewish Legion. Sometimes beleaguered Jewish communities were praised by the media for taking up England’s cause to conquer Palestine.</p>
<p>Since Israel’s creation in 1948 different Canadian governments have expressed varying degrees of support. But overall, the laudatory public declarations have continued.</p>
<p>After a long career of support for Zionism as external minister and prime minister, Lester Pearson referred to that country as “an outpost, if you will, of the West in the Middle East.”</p>
<p>External Affairs Minister Don Jamieson echoed this sentiment in an October 1977 speech. “Israel is an increasingly valuable ally of the West and Jews and non-Jews alike should see to it that Israel remains … an ally of the Western world,” Jamieson said. “We in Canada must see to it that when Israel is making such tremendous sacrifices, we should stand ready to help Israel with oil and material assistance.”</p>
<p>Yes, the current government is more aggressive in its public declarations than any before it and this has helped drive the establishment Jewish community to an even more hardline position.</p>
<p>To the Conservatives’ delight, two years ago the ninety-year old Canadian Jewish Congress was disbanded by its wealthy donors in favor of an even more Israel-focused Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs. Similarly, the Conservatives’ strong ties to Christian Zionism has prodded the Zionist lobby group B’nai Brith to deepen its ties with Canada Christian College and the prominent right-wing evangelist Charles McVety.</p>
<p>At the same time, the anti-racist sectors of Canada’s Jewish community have made major strides in recent years. Groups such as Independent Jewish Voices, Not In Our Name, Jewish Voice for Peace, the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, Women in Solidarity with Palestine and Jews for a Just Peace, have undercut the notion that all Canadian Jews support Israeli policy or Zionism. But these groups are unlikely to become dominant voices within the Jewish community until there is a shift in Canada’s political culture.</p>
<p>Canadian Zionism has long been part of the religious and political establishment. In every community there are those who take the side of the rich and powerful.</p>

			<p><strong>What really happened in the Ukrainian crisis?</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Ukrainedeal3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>It is freezing cold in Kiev, legendary city of golden domes on the banks of Dnieper River – cradle of ancient Russian civilisation and the most charming of East European capitals. It is a comfortable and rather prosperous place, with hundreds of small and cosy restaurants, neat streets, sundry parks and that magnificent river. The girls are pretty and the men are sturdy. Kiev is more relaxed than Moscow, and easier on the wallet. Though statistics say the Ukraine is broke and its people should be as poor as Africans, in reality they aren&#8217;t doing too badly, thanks to their fiscal imprudence. The government borrowed and spent freely, heavily subsidised housing and heating, and they brazenly avoided devaluation of the national currency and the austerity program prescribed by the IMF. This living on credit can go only so far: the Ukraine was doomed to default on its debts next month or sooner, and this is one of the reasons for the present commotion.</p>
<p>A tug-of-war between the East and the West for the future of Ukraine lasted over a month, and has ended for all practical purposes in a resounding victory for Vladimir Putin, adding to his previous successes in Syria and Iran. The trouble began when the administration of President Yanukovich went looking for credits to reschedule its loans and avoid default. There were no offers. They turned to the EC for help; the EC, chiefly Poland and Germany, seeing that the Ukrainian administration was desperate, prepared an association agreement of unusual severity.</p>
<p>The EC is quite hard on its new East European members, Latvia, Romania, Bulgaria et al.: these countries had their industry and agriculture decimated, their young people working menial jobs in Western Europe, their population drop exceeded that of the WWII.</p>
<p>But the association agreement offered to the Ukraine was even worse. It would turn the Ukraine into an impoverished colony of the EC without giving it even the dubious advantages of membership (such as freedom of work and travel in the EC). In desperation, Yanukovich agreed to sign on the dotted line, in vain hopes of getting a large enough loan to avoid collapse. But the EC has no money to spare – it has to provide for Greece, Italy, Spain. Now Russia entered the picture. At the time, relations of the Ukraine and Russia were far from good. Russians had become snotty with their oil money, the Ukrainians blamed their troubles on Russians, but Russia was still the biggest market for Ukrainian products.</p>
<p>For Russia, the EC agreement meant trouble: currently the Ukraine sells its output in Russia with very little customs protection; the borders are porous; people move freely across the border, without even a passport. If the EC association agreement were signed, the EC products would flood Russia through the Ukrainian window of opportunity. So Putin spelled out the rules to Yanukovich: if you sign with the EC, Russian tariffs will rise. This would put some 400,000 Ukrainians out of work right away. Yanukovich balked and refused to sign the EC agreement at the last minute. (I predicted this in my report from Kiev full three weeks before it happened, when nobody believed it – a source of pride).</p>
<p>The EC, and the US standing behind it, were quite upset. Besides the loss of potential economic profit, they had another important reason: they wanted to keep Russia farther away from Europe, and they wanted to keep Russia weak. Russia is not the Soviet Union, but some of the Soviet disobedience to Western imperial designs still lingers in Moscow: be it in Syria, Egypt, Vietnam, Cuba, Angola, Venezuela or Zimbabwe, the Empire can’t have its way while the Russian bear is relatively strong. Russia without the Ukraine can’t be really powerful: it would be like the US with its Mid-western and Pacific states chopped away. The West does not want the Ukraine to prosper, or to become a stable and strong state either, so it cannot join Russia and make <i>it</i> stronger. A weak, poor and destabilised Ukraine in semi-colonial dependence to the West with some NATO bases is the best future for the country, as perceived by Washington or Brussels.</p>
<p>Angered by this last-moment-escape of Yanukovich, the West activated its supporters. For over a month, Kiev has been besieged by huge crowds bussed from all over the Ukraine, bearing a local strain of the Arab Spring in the far north. Less violent than Tahrir, their Maidan Square became a symbol of struggle for the European strategic future of the country. The Ukraine was turned into the latest battle ground between the US-led alliance and a rising Russia. Would it be a revanche for Obama’s Syria debacle, or another heavy strike at fading American hegemony?</p>
<p>The simple division into “pro-East” and “pro-West” has been complicated by the heterogeneity of the Ukraine. The loosely knit country of differing regions is quite similar in its makeup to the Yugoslavia of old. It is another post-Versailles hotchpotch of a country made up after the First World War of bits and pieces, and made independent after the Soviet collapse in 1991. Some parts of this “Ukraine” were incorporated by Russia 500 years ago, the Ukraine proper (a much smaller parcel of land, bearing this name) joined Russia 350 years ago, whilst the Western Ukraine (called the “Eastern Regions”) was acquired by Stalin in 1939, and the Crimea was incorporated in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic by Khrushchev in 1954.</p>
<p>The Ukraine is as Russian as the South-of-France is French and as Texas and California are American. Yes, some hundreds years ago, Provence was independent from Paris, &#8211; it had its own language and art; while Nice and Savoy became French rather recently. Yes, California and Texas joined the Union rather late too. Still, we understand that they are – by now – parts of those larger countries, ifs and buts notwithstanding. But if they were forced to secede, they would probably evolve a new historic narrative stressing the French ill treatment of the South in the Cathar Crusade, or dispossession of Spanish and Russian residents of California.</p>
<p>Accordingly, since the Ukraine’s independence, the authorities have been busy nation-building, enforcing a single official language and creating a new national myth for its 45 million inhabitants. The crowds milling about the Maidan were predominantly (though not exclusively) arrivals from Galicia, a mountainous county bordering with Poland and Hungary, 500 km (300 miles) away from Kiev, and natives of the capital refer to the Maidan gathering as a “Galician occupation”.</p>
<p>Like the fiery Bretons, the Galicians are fierce nationalists, bearers of a true Ukrainian spirit (whatever <i>that</i> means). Under Polish and Austrian rule for centuries, whilst the Jews were economically powerful, they are a strongly anti-Jewish and anti-Polish lot, and their modern identity centred around their support for Hitler during the WWII, accompanied by the ethnic cleansing of their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacres_of_Poles_in_Volhynia_and_Eastern_Galicia">Polish</a> and <a href="http://www.academia.edu/1071581/The_Ukrainian_Insurgent_Army_UPA_and_the_Holocaust">Jewish</a> neighbours. After the WWII, the remainder of pro-Hitler Galician SS fighters were adopted by US Intelligence, re-armed and turned into a guerrilla force against the Soviets. They added an anti-Russian line to their two ancient hatreds and kept fighting the “forest war” until 1956, and these ties between the Cold Warriors have survived the thaw.</p>
<p>After 1991, when the independent Ukraine was created, in the void of state-building traditions, the Galicians were lauded as &#8216;true Ukrainians’, as they were the only Ukrainians who ever wanted independence. Their language was used as the basis of a new national state language, their traditions became enshrined on the state level. Memorials of Galician Nazi collaborators and mass murderers Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych peppered the land, often provoking the indignation of other Ukrainians. The Galicians played an important part in the 2004 Orange Revolution as well, when the results of presidential elections were declared void and the pro-Western candidate Mr Yuschenko got the upper hand in the re-run.</p>
<p>However, in 2004, many Kievans also supported Yuschenko, hoping for the Western alliance and a bright new future. Now, in 2013, the city&#8217;s support for the Maidan was quite low, and the people of Kiev complained loudly about the mess created by the invading throngs: felled trees, burned benches, despoiled buildings and a lot of biological waste. Still, Kiev is home to many NGOs; city intellectuals receive generous help from the US and EC. The old comprador spirit is always strongest in the capitals.</p>
<p>For the East and Southeast of the Ukraine, the populous and heavily industrialised regions, the proposal of association with the EC is a no-go, with no ifs, ands or buts. They produce coal, steel, machinery, cars, missiles, tanks and aircraft. Western imports would erase Ukrainian industry right off the map, as the EC officials freely admit. Even the Poles, hardly a paragon of industrial development, had the audacity to say to the Ukraine: we’ll do the technical stuff, you&#8217;d better invest in agriculture. This is easier to say than to do: the EC has a lot of regulations that make Ukrainian products unfit for sale and consumption in Europe. Ukrainian experts estimated their expected losses for entering into association with the EC at anything from 20 to 150 billion euros.</p>
<p>For Galicians, the association would work fine. Their speaker at the Maidan called on the youth to ‘go where you can get money’ and do not give a damn for industry. They make their income in two ways: providing bed-and breakfast rooms for Western tourists and working in Poland and Germany as maids and menials. They hoped they would get visa-free access to Europe and make a decent income for themselves. Meanwhile, nobody offered them a visa-waiver arrangement. The Brits mull over leaving the EC, because of the Poles who flooded their country; the Ukrainians would be too much for London. Only the Americans, always generous at somebody’s else expense, demanded the EC drop its visa requirement for them.</p>
<p>While the Maidan was boiling, the West sent its emissaries, ministers and members of parliament to cheer the Maidan crowd, to call for President Yanukovich to resign and for a revolution to install pro-Western rule. Senator McCain went there and made a few firebrand speeches. The EC declared Yanukovich “illegitimate” because so many of his citizens demonstrated against him. But when millions of French citizens demonstrated against their president, when Occupy Wall Street was violently dispersed, nobody thought the government of France or the US president had lost legitimacy…</p>
<p>Victoria Nuland, the Assistant Secretary of State, shared her biscuits with the demonstrators, and demanded from the oligarchs support for the “European cause” or their businesses would suffer. The Ukrainian oligarchs are very wealthy, and they prefer the Ukraine as it is, sitting on the fence between the East and the West. They are afraid that the Russian companies will strip their assets should the Ukraine join the Customs Union, and they know that they are not competitive enough to compete with the EC. Pushed now by Nuland, they were close to falling on the EC side.</p>
<p>Yanukovich was in big trouble. The default was rapidly approaching. He annoyed the pro-Western populace, and he irritated his own supporters, the people of the East and Southeast. The Ukraine had a real chance of collapsing into anarchy. A far-right nationalist party, Svoboda (Liberty), probably the nearest thing to the Nazi party to arise in Europe since 1945, made a bid for power. The EC politicians accused Russia of pressurising the Ukraine; Russian missiles suddenly emerged in the western-most tip of Russia, a few minutes flight from Berlin. The Russian armed forces discussed the US strategy of a “disarming first strike”. The tension was very high.</p>
<p>Edward Lucas, the <i>Economist&#8217;s</i> international editor and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Cold-War-Putins/dp/B005FOIQMU">The New Cold War</a>, is a hawk of the Churchill and Reagan variety. For him, Russia is an enemy, whether ruled by Tsar, by Stalin or by Putin. He <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304744304579250241092282888">wrote</a>: “It is no exaggeration to say that the [Ukraine] determines the long-term future of the entire former Soviet Union. If Ukraine adopts a Euro-Atlantic orientation, then the Putin regime and its satrapies are finished… But if Ukraine falls into Russia&#8217;s grip, then the outlook is bleak and dangerous&#8230; Europe&#8217;s own security will also be endangered. NATO is already struggling to protect the Baltic states and Poland from the integrated and increasingly impressive military forces of Russia and Belarus. Add Ukraine to that alliance, and a headache turns into a nightmare.”</p>
<p>In this cliff-hanging situation, Putin made his pre-emptive strike. At a meeting in the Kremlin, he agreed to buy fifteen billion euros worth of Ukrainian Eurobonds and cut the natural gas price by a third. This meant there would be no default; no massive unemployment; no happy hunting ground for the neo-Nazi thugs of Svoboda; no cheap and plentiful Ukrainian prostitutes and menials for the Germans and Poles; and Ukrainian homes will be warm this Christmas. Better yet, the presidents agreed to reforge their industrial cooperation. When Russia and Ukraine formed a single country, they built spaceships; apart, they can hardly launch a naval ship. Though unification isn’t on the map yet, it would make sense for both partners. This artificially divided country can be united, and it would do a lot of good for both of their populaces, and for all people seeking freedom from US hegemony.</p>
<p>There are a lot of difficulties ahead: Putin and Yanukovich are not friends, Ukrainian leaders are prone to renege, the US and the EC have a lot of resources. But meanwhile, it is a victory to celebrate this Christmas tide. Such victories keep Iran safe from US bombardment, inspire the Japanese to demand removal of Okinawa base, encourage those seeking closure of Guantanamo jail, cheer up Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, frighten the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">NSA</a> and CIA and allow French Catholics to march against Hollande’s child-trade laws.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What is the secret of Putin’s success? Edward Lucas said, in an interview to the pro-Western <i>Ekho Moskvy</i> radio: “Putin had a great year &#8211; Snowden, Syria, Ukraine. He checkmated Europe. He is a great player: he notices our weaknesses and turns them into his victories. He is good in diplomatic bluff, and in the game of Divide and Rule. He makes the Europeans think that the US is weak, and he convinced the US that Europeans are useless”.</p>
<p>I would offer an alternative explanation. The winds and hidden currents of history respond to those who feel their way. Putin is no less likely a roguish leader of global resistance than Princess Leia or Captain Solo were in <i>Star Wars</i>. Just the time for such a man is ripe.</p>
<p>Unlike Solo, he is not an adventurer. He is a prudent man. He does not try his luck, he waits, even procrastinates. He did not try to change regime in Tbilisi in 2008, when his troops were already on the outskirts of the city. He did not try his luck in Kiev, either. He has spent many hours in many meetings with Yanukovich whom he supposedly personally dislikes.</p>
<p>Like Captain Solo, Putin is a man who is ready to pay his way, full price, and such politicians are rare. “Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman&#8217;s mouth?”, asked a James Joyce character, and answered: “His proudest boast is <i>I paid my way</i>.” Those were Englishmen of another era, long before the likes of Blair, <i>et al.</i></p>
<p>While McCain and Nuland, Merkel and Bildt speak of the European choice for the Ukraine, none of them is ready to pay for it. Only Russia is ready to pay her way, in the Joycean sense, whether in cash, as now, or in blood, as in WWII.</p>
<p>Putin is also a magnanimous man. He celebrated his Ukrainian victory and forthcoming Christmas by forgiving his personal and political enemies and setting them free: the Pussy Riot punks, Khodorkovsky the murderous oligarch, rioters… And his last press conference he carried out in Captain Solo self-deprecating mode, and this, for a man in his position, is a very good sign.</p>

<p>Inflammatory remarks by the musician <a title="More from the Guardian on Roger Waters" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/roger-waters">Roger Waters</a>, formerly of <a title="" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd">Pink Floyd</a>, comparing the modern Israeli state to Nazi Germany have put him at the centre of a furious dispute.</p>
<p>Performers and religious figures reacted angrily to the veteran rock star&#8217;s argument that Israeli treatment of the Palestinians can be compared to the atrocities of Nazi Germany. &#8220;The parallels with what went on in the 1930s in Germany are so crushingly obvious,&#8221; he said in an American online interview last week.</p>
<p>Waters, 70, a <a title="link to Waters comment in 2011" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/11/cultural-boycott-west-bank-wall">well-known supporter of the Palestinian cause</a>, has frequently defended himself against accusations that he is antisemitic, claiming he has a right to urge fellow artists to boycott <a title="More from the Guardian on Israel" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>.</p>
<p>This summer he was criticised for using a pig-shaped balloon adorned with Jewish symbols, including a Star of David, as one part of the stage effects at his concerts. Waters countered that it was just one of several religious and political symbols in the show and not an attempt to single out Judaism as an evil force.</p>
<p>Now leading American thinker Rabbi Shmuley Boteach has raised the stakes <a title="link to piece in New York Observer" href="http://observer.com/2013/12/the-anti-semitic-stench-of-pink-floyd/">by describing Waters&#8217; views as audacious and clearly antisemitic</a>.</p>
<p>Writing in the <a title="" href="http://observer.com/2013/12/the-anti-semitic-stench-of-pink-floyd/"><em>New York Observer</em></a>, the rabbi said: &#8220;Mr Waters, the Nazis were a genocidal regime that murdered six million Jews. That you would have the audacity to compare Jews to monsters who murdered them shows you have no decency, you have no heart, you have no soul.&#8221; The rabbi was responding to Waters&#8217;s latest comments on the Middle East.<a title="link to Counterpunch" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/06/an-interview-with-pink-floyds-roger-waters/">Speaking to the leftwing <em>CounterPunch</em> magazine</a>, the musician criticised the US government for being unduly influenced by the Israeli &#8220;propaganda machine&#8221;.</p>
<p>The former <a title="More from the Guardian on Pink Floyd" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd">Pink Floyd</a> frontman, who has recently toured the world with a show based on the influential 1979 album <em>The Wall</em>, went on to describe the Israeli rabbinate as &#8220;bizarre&#8221; and accused them of believing that Palestinians and other Arabs in the Middle East were &#8220;sub-human&#8221;. Waters suggested the &#8220;Jewish lobby&#8221; was &#8220;extraordinarily powerful&#8221;. On the subject of the Holocaust, he said: &#8220;There were many people that pretended that the oppression of the Jews was not going on. From 1933 until 1946. So this is not a new scenario. Except that this time it&#8217;s the Palestinian people being murdered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking from New York on Saturday night, Waters strongly rejected Rabbi Boteach&#8217;s characterisation of his views. He said: &#8220;I do not know Rabbi Boteach, and am not prepared to get into a slanging match with him. I will say this: I have nothing against Jews or Israelis, and I am not antisemitic. I deplore the policies of the Israeli government in the occupied territories and Gaza. They are immoral, inhuman and illegal. I will continue my non-violent protests as long as the government of Israel continues with these policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Rabbi Boteach can make a case for the Israel government&#8217;s policies, I look forward to hearing it. It is difficult to make arguments to defend the Israeli government&#8217;s policies, so would-be defenders often use a diversionary tactic, they routinely drag the critic into a public arena and accuse them of being an antisemite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Waters continued: &#8220;The Holocaust was brutal and disgusting beyond our imagination. We must never forget it. We must always remain vigilant. We must never stand by silent and indifferent to the sufferings of others, whatever their race, colour, ethnic background or religion. All human beings deserve the right to live equally under the law.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="link to Guardian profile" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/karen-pollock">Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust</a>, said: &#8220;Everyone is entitled to an opinion and to advocate passionately for a cause, but drawing inappropriate parallels with the Holocaust insults the memory of the six million Jews – men, women and children – murdered by the Nazis. These kinds of attacks are commonly used as veiled antisemitism and should be exposed as such.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jo-Ann Mort, vice-chair of US Jewish group Americans for Peace Now, is calling for musicians and other entertainers to go to Israel to understand that there is also Israeli opposition to discrimination against Arabs. Speaking to the <em>Observer</em> from California, she said it was important for international performers to &#8220;speak their mind to audiences about the nation&#8217;s successes and failures. Just as Israeli musicians – Jewish, Muslim and Christian – do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The media in Israel flock to foreign entertainers. Performers would have the opportunity to make their viewpoints known – and it will also help to break the logjam that fundamentalists have had on both sides,&#8221; she argued.</p>
<p>Mort supports the <a title="link to Huffpo interview" href="http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/arab-and-jew-david-broza/52a5e15cfe3444790b000492">anti-boycott approach of Israeli singer and activist David Broza</a>, whose forthcoming album <a title="" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/East-Jerusalem-West-David-Broza/dp/B00H9WAPOS"><em>East Jerusalem/West Jerusalem</em></a>features covers of songs that urge understanding, including Waters&#8217;s own song Mother, from the album <em>The Wall</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Music captivates your head and your mind,&#8221; Broza recently argued. &#8220;If it comes with good vibes, then everyone wants to be part of it. The hard work comes from having a belief in what you are doing and in not stopping at the barricades that are posted at every corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week Waters&#8217;s words drew a strong response from the <a title="" href="http://www.thecst.org.uk/">Community Security Trust</a>, the body that monitors anti-Jewish activity in Britain. A spokesman told the <em>Jewish Chronicle</em> that Waters&#8217;s comments &#8220;echo the language of antisemitism&#8221; and added that the musician was &#8220;living proof of how easily people who pursue extreme anti-Israel politics can drift into antisemitic statements and ideas&#8221;.</p>
<p><a title="" href="http://www.bicom.org.uk/">Bicom,</a> the UK-based Israel advocacy organisation, also condemned Waters&#8217;s views. Chief executive Dermot Kehoe said: &#8220;The statements by Roger Waters calling for a cultural boycott of Israel and comparing the country to Nazi Germany are repugnant and fly in the face of both the reality in Israel today and the ongoing peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.&#8221;</p>
<p>In August Waters used his Facebook page to <a title="" href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/roger-waters-the-wall/an-open-letter-from-roger-waters/688037331210720">respond to allegations</a> that he was an &#8220;open hater of Jews&#8221;, made by Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in an interview with an American weekly Jewish newspaper, the <a title="" href="http://www.algemeiner.com/"><em>Algemeiner</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often I can ignore these attacks, but Rabbi Cooper&#8217;s accusations are so wild and bigoted they demand a response,&#8221; Waters wrote, adding that he had &#8220;many very close Jewish friends&#8221;.</p>

</div>
<p>Turkey is a secular state.   So claim its government and nearly all mainstream Western media.  They are mistaken.</p>
<p>In civilized, democratic countries, secularism means not only a respectful separation between church and state but also freedom of religion.  As we shall demonstrate, Turkish policies have long been the antithesis of secularism.</p>
<p>The Turkish government massively supports and funds Islam – specifically Sunni Islam &#8211; inside the country.  Turkey simultaneously represses religions such as Alevism, and bullies and persecutes indigenous Christians, most of whom it liquidated in 20<sup>th</sup> century genocides.  Moreover, it uses Islam to project Turkish political power into Europe, Asia, and elsewhere.  Turkey’s system is more properly termed State Islam.</p>
<p>This article is not a criticism of Islam or its faithful.  We respect both.  Turkey’s secularism myth, nevertheless, cries out to be laid bare.</p>
<p><b>State Islam</b></p>
<p>The Directorate of Religious Affairs – known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Religious_Affairs">Diyanet</a> – is the government body that represents and directs all of Sunni Islam in Turkey.  Created in 1924, a year after the Republic of Turkey was formed, the Diyanet is enshrined in Article 136 of the Turkish Constitution.  The Diyanet is huge and powerful.  Operating under the Prime Minister, it employs about 100,000.  All Sunni clergy are salaried civil servants of the Diyanet.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/columnists/yavuz-baydar_329311-diyanet-tops-the-budget-league.html">Diyanet’s $2 billion annual outlay</a> exceeds the combined budgets of Turkey’s Foreign, Energy, and Environmental Ministries.  By law a political party can be dissolved if it dares to advocate the Diyanet’s abolition.</p>
<p>Until recently, the Diyanet wrote all the sermons for its clergy, but reportedly now sometimes allows them to write their own, though their contents are controlled.</p>
<p>Would the U.S.<b> –</b> or any democratic Western country – be termed “secular” if it funded a huge Christian government agency that employed all Christian clergy and controlled their sermons?  Obviously not.</p>
<p>Who <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/turkey-mosque-ownership.html">owns</a>Turkey’s 80,000 mosques?  It’s not always clear.  Even many Turks wonder.  For sure, however, the Diyanet controls all mosques. (Shiite Muslims represent only about 3% of Turkey’s 80 million people and are largely independent of the Diyanet.)</p>
<p>Two large mosques to be built on Istanbul’s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-28/turkey-s-erdogan-supports-mosque-on-istanbul-hill-hurriyet-says.html">Camlica Hill and Taksim Square</a> are personal projects of Prime Minister Erdogan.  The government is apparently paying most of the costs, not something a secular state would do.</p>
<p>The Diyanet operates not only in Turkey but worldwide. Turkish foreign policy and the Diyanet are intertwined.  The latter promotes the country’s political influence abroad.</p>
<p><b>Worldwide Reach</b></p>
<p>The Diyanet has a Foreign Affairs department that sends religious consultants not only into Muslim countries, such as those in Central Asia and Africa, but also into the United States, France, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, and other European countries.</p>
<p>Indeed, some Turkish embassies and consulates have a religious affairs department and attachés that work with local Diyanet representatives.   Turkey is very active, for instance, in the Netherlands where it reportedly pays the salaries of the Diyanet-affiliated Dutch Islamic Foundation’s staff.</p>
<p>In partnership with Turkey’s Religious Foundation, the Diyanet has in the last two decades <a href="http://www.diyanet.gov.tr/en/">constructed or renovated mosques</a> in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia, northern Cyprus, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>A $100 million, 15-acre <a href="http://www.muslimlinkpaper.com/community-news/community-news/3358-a-symbol-of-friendship.html">Turkish American Culture and Civilization Center</a> (TACCC), which includes a large mosque, is being built in Lanham, Maryland, 14 miles from Washington, D.C.  It is “<a href="http://www.muslimlinkpaper.com/community-news/community-news/3358-a-symbol-of-friendship.html">a project of the government of Turkey</a>” and the Turkish American Community Center.  The latter’s <a href="http://www.taccenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=87&amp;Itemid=289&amp;lang=en">older mosque</a> is “related to the Republic of Turkey and the Department of Religious Affairs [Diyanet].”  Several months ago, PM Erdogan placed a ceremonial stone at the TACCC construction site.</p>
<p>No truly secular state would do these things.   Nor would it persecute persons of other religions.</p>
<p><b>Religious Repression</b></p>
<p>Last year the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), established by Congress, <a href="http://asbarez.com/101990/state-dept-%E2%80%99s-disgraceful-censorship-of-report-blacklisting-turkey/">placed Turkey in its worst category</a>, a “Country of Particular Concern,” alongside Burma, China, Pakistan, and a dozen others.</p>
<p>Turkey, noted the USCIRF, “significantly restricts religious freedom, especially for non-Muslim religious minority communities – including the Greek, Armenian, and SyriacOrthodoxChurches, the Roman Catholic and ProtestantChurches, and the Jewish community.”</p>
<p>Restrictions that “deny non-Muslim communities the rights to train clergy, offer religious education, and own and maintain places of worship, have led to their decline, and in some cases their virtual disappearance.”</p>
<p>Such mistreatment of Christians, numbering only about 100,000, is particularly reprehensible given that Turkey carried out <a href="http://www.armenian-genocide.org/">genocide from 1915 to 1923</a> against millions of indigenous <a href="http://www.genocidescholars.org/sites/default/files/document%09%5Bcurrent-page%3A1%5D/documents/IAGS-Resolution-Assyrian%20and%20Greek%20Genocide.pdf">Christian Armenians, Greeks, and Syriacs</a>, including many Catholics and Protestants.</p>
<p>The persecution of non-Muslims continued even after the Turkish Republic came about in 1923.  The infamous Capital Tax (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varl%C4%B1k_Vergisi">Varlik Vergisi</a>) program during World War II, as but one example, deliberately taxed Christians and Jews at extortionate rates that often exceeded their income.  Men were sent to labor camps in the interior when unable to pay.  Families were bankrupted.  Only an international outcry stopped the program.</p>
<p>Thousands of Christian churches, schools, hospitals, orphanages, cemeteries, and other community properties have been continually seized by Turkey in the past several decades.</p>
<p>Though Turkey has recently returned some of these properties under international pressure, the vast majority has not been, and probably will not be, returned.</p>
<p>Countless ancient Armenian churches and monasteries, such as Saint Mark’s (Nshan) in Sivas, have been deliberately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_cultural_heritage_in_Turkey">destroyed</a>, sometimes with explosives. Others serve as stables.   Earlier this year in the cities of Iznik and Trabzon, old Greek churches were converted to mosques.</p>
<p>Alevism is a religion that has some 10 to 20 million adherents in Turkey. Complex and somewhat mysterious, it contains elements of Shia Islam, Sufism, paganism, and other spiritual and religious traditions.  Alevis worship in houses called cemevis, not mosques.  Alevis and cemevis are not recognized by the Turkish government.  Alevis complain bitterly, to little avail.</p>
<p>Alevis have long been the victims of discrimination and even violent attacks, such as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivas_massacre">Sivas in 1993</a> when 35 leading Alevis were murdered by mobs, and most recently this year in Ankara, when police fired tear-gas at protesting Alevis.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.aina.org/news/2011092819935.htm">Turkey may look like a secular state on paper</a>,” says Izzettin Dogan, a leading Alevi, “but in terms of international law it is actually a Sunni Islamic state.”  He is correct, but most of the outside world is oblivious to voices such as his.</p>
<p><b>True Secularism</b></p>
<p>Some Turks feel that their country is secular because the Diyanet’s hegemony moderates Islam against extremist tendencies.  There may be some truth to that.</p>
<p>But as secularism must include a respectful distance between religion and state, Turkey would still not qualify.   Along with Turkey’s domestic religious repression, and employing the Diyanet in foreign policy, the claim of secularism is simply fallacious.</p>
<p>The Turkish government is in full-blown denial about secularism and religious freedom, as evidenced by PM Erdogan’s preposterous claim two years ago that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iYbCJEmBCnS-3bEXWY9mkdKHxSwA?docId=CNG.f48d18da1b3a189681a446d568706b38.641&amp;hl=en">“Turkey is a secular state where all religions are equal.”  </a></p>
<p>If Turkey is ever to be secular, it must allow the free exercise of all religions – including Islam – and guarantee the rights of the faithful to be free from harassment and compulsion.   The Turkish government’s acknowledgement of its past and present wrongs, especially to the non-Turkish and non-Muslim communities, and making genuine amends, must be part of this process.</p>
<p>Until then – particularly in the West – mainstream media, governments, religious leaders, academicians, and political analysts should cease swallowing Turkey’s fraudulent claim of secularism.</p>

<p>I also will be TWEETING it to every Media outlet I can find at <a href="https://twitter.com/wearewideawake">TWITTER</a>; but first a little background:</p>
<p>I learned about Vanunu while researching my first historical novel and wrote him into the Chapter <a href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1900&amp;Itemid=239">THANKSGIVING EVE 1987 </a></p>
<p>A few months later, I met Vanunu during my first of 8 journeys to both sides of The Wall in Israel Palestine and wrote that experience in the Chapter <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=940&amp;Itemid=201">16 Days in Israel Palestine</a><br />
<strong><br />
<a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-">The last time I saw Vanunu </a></strong>was a week before Thanksgiving 2013:</p>
<div><img title="b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" src="http://www.eileenfleming.org/images/easyblog_images/63/b2ap3_thumbnail_112213-VMJC-ef.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>One correction I have repeatedly addressed on the WWW is the <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26">legend of Cindy/Cheryl and the “honey trap”</a>:</p>
<p>When I asked Vanunu what he was thinking when he took off with Cindy, he maintained eye contact and readily replied,</p>
<p>“It wasn’t like THAT-when Maxwell’s paper published my photo without ever talking to me and some of the stolen Dimona photos with a very bad story against me, I knew the Mossad was after me. Cindy said she had a sister in Rome and I thought I would be safe there until I could return to London.</p>
<p>“We went to movies and art galleries. I trusted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, as soon as I got into the apartment, I was hit on the head and drugged. When I woke up and they took me for interrogation, they threw the Times article on the table and said, ‘Look, what you did.’ I was so relieved they had published it and that I had done what I did.”</p>
<p>What &#8216;Cindy&#8217; did was masquerade as an American beautician on holiday in London. In reality, &#8216;Cindy&#8217; was the American Mossad agent, Cheryl Hanin Bentov who was using her sister-in-laws passport!</p>
<p>It is illegal under American-Israeli diplomatic protocols for the Mossad to operate in America.</p>

<p>Dear New York Times,</p>
<p>As the current leader of the <a href="https://www.causes.com/profiles/188026196/about">International Cause dedicated to help free Mordechai Vanunu</a>, I am informing you of Mordechai Vanunu&#8217;s mid December Appeal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-">On 6 December, Vanunu wrote:</a> &#8220;Court hearing against the restrictions not to leave Israel, schedule hearing in the Supreme court will be Dec&#8217; 16, 2013. The same Appeal was in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011<strong>. The court can send me free and end all this case from 1986-2013.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1986, Israel kidnapped Vanunu from Rome and after a closed door trial, convicted him of espionage and treason.   Although released on 21 April 2004, Israel has denied Vanunu the right to  &#8220;get on the first plane out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1985, Vanunu suffered a crisis of conscience, when he realized he was &#8220;a bolt&#8221; in the manufacturing of WMD.</p>
<p>After a supervisor carelessly left the keys in the shower room, Vanunu seized his opportunity to document top secret locations within Israel&#8217;s 7-story underground nuclear facility and he spent a few intense hours doing just that!</p>
<p>View Vanunu&#8217;s photos of the Dimona at his YouTube Channel:<br />
<iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4nSOlG6Wpr8?wmode=transparent" height="225" width="400" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>A few months later, Vanunu leaves Israel and travels throughout Europe with the two rolls of undeveloped film.   After meeting Peter Hounam, a reporter for the London Sunday Times, Vanunu shares all he knew in his position as a mid-level technician and the two develop the film.</p>
<p>A total of 1,200 pages of transcript of Vanunu&#8217;s closed door trial have been released.<br />
Defense witness Peter Hounam stated, &#8220;We did not pay him money, but only covered his expenses&#8230;Money did not motivate him.&#8221;</p>
<p>During my conversations with <a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26">Vanunu beginning in 2005, he told me:<br />
</a><br />
&#8220;All the secrets I had were published in 1989 in an important book, by [Nuclear Physicist] Frank Barnaby, <em><strong>The Invisible Bomb: Nuclear Arms Race in the Middle East.</strong></em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnaby testified, &#8220;I found Vanunu very straightforward about his motives for violating Israel&#8217;s secrecy laws he explained to me that he believed that both the Israeli and the world public had the right to know about the information he passed on. He seemed to me to be acting ideologically.<br />
<strong><br />
&#8220;Israel&#8217;s political leaders have, he said, consistently lied about Israel&#8217;s nuclear-weapons programme and he found this unacceptable in a democracy. </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The knowledge that Vanunu had about Israel&#8217;s nuclear weapons, about the operations at Dimona, and about security at Dimona could not be of any use to anyone today. He left Dimona in October 1985.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=26"><br />
Vanunu also told me:<br />
</a><br />
“Did you know that President Kennedy tried to stop Israel from building atomic weapons? In 1963, he forced Prime Minister Ben Guirion to admit the Dimona was not a textile plant, as the sign outside proclaimed, but a nuclear plant. The Prime Minister said, ‘The nuclear reactor is only for peace.’</p>
<p>“Kennedy insisted on an open internal inspection. He wrote letters demanding that Ben Guirion open up the Dimona for inspection.</p>
<p>“The French were responsible for the actual building of the Dimona. The Germans gave the money; they were feeling guilty for the Holocaust, and tried to pay their way out.</p>
<p>“When Johnson became president, he made an agreement with Israel that two senators would come every year to inspect. Before the senators would visit, the Israelis would build a wall to block the underground elevators and stairways. From 1963 to ’69, the senators came, but they never knew about the wall that hid the rest of the Dimona from them.</p>
<p>“Nixon stopped the inspections and agreed to ignore the situation. As a result, Israel increased production. In 1986, there were over two hundred bombs. Today, they may have enough plutonium for ten bombs a year.”</p>

<p>Dear New York Times,</p>
<p>Photo of Mordechai Vanunu, by me 24 November 2013, east Jerusalem.</p>
<div><img title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Vanunu-24-Nov.-13-SABEEL9.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Vanunu-24-Nov.-13-SABEEL9.jpg" src="http://www.eileenfleming.org/images/easyblog_images/63/b2ap3_thumbnail_Vanunu-24-Nov.-13-SABEEL9.jpg" border="0" /></div>
<p>As the current leader of the <a href="https://www.causes.com/profiles/188026196/about">international cause dedicated to free Mordechai Vanunu </a>I write to alert you that on<a href="http://www.eileenfleming.org/index.php/eileens-blog/entry/mordechai-vanunus-upcoming-appeal-to-"> 9 December, Vanunu wrote:</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Changes in date, Court hearing against the restrictions not to leave Israel, schedule <strong>hearing in the Supreme court will be Dec&#8217; 25, 2013</strong>, moved from the Dec&#8217; 16, the same Appeal was 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. <strong>The court can send me free and end all this case from 1986-2013.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>The restrictions that have subjected Vanunu to 24/7 surveillance [his movements, phone calls and emails] since he emerged from 18 years behind bars on 21 April 2004, come from the Emergency Defense Regulations, which were implemented by Britain against Palestinians and Jews after World War II.</p>
<p>Attorney Yaccov Shapiro, who later became Israel&#8217;s Minister Of Justice, described the Emergency Defense Regulations as &#8220;unparalleled in any civilized country: there were no such laws in Nazi Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>View Vanunu moments after emerging from 18 years behind bars:</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A1VOB8B3g1o?wmode=transparent" height="225" width="400" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>On 2 October 2009,<strong> The Washington Times</strong> reported that President Obama agreed to keep Israel&#8217;s nukes &#8216;secret&#8217; and reaffirmed a 4-decade-old understanding that has allowed Israel to keep a nuclear arsenal without opening it to international inspections.</p>
<p>Three officials spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were discussing private conversations, but all said Obama pledged to maintain the agreement when he first hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in May 2009.</p>
<p><strong>On 24, November 2006,</strong> Vanunu wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;My lawyer succeeded to reveal a few very important facts: This General of the Army also was not allowed to see all the secrets that he is required to protect by these restrictions that they claim I know them. So, he gave orders of restrictions without knowing what he is protecting or that he is also following orders blindly, and Mossad Sheen Bet using its authority for just punishing me.</p>
<p>&#8220;He testified that it is not a crime for me to talk with foreigners in general anywhere. He testified that I can speak freely to any Israeli citizens about anything; it is not his concern what I am saying to them. These Israelis can give this information to any foreigners. It was difficult for the Judge to understand why this dichotomy exits between foreigners and Israelis. It means that it is not about secrecy but about something else.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In 2004, </strong>Yossi Melman wrote for Haaretz:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the secret that hasn&#8217;t yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what he did, and the story of the subsequent attempts at cover-up, whitewashing and protection of senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will the New York Times shine a light on Israel&#8217;s Nuclear Whistle Blower&#8217;s nearly 10 year struggle for freedom from Israel before his Christmas Day appeal?</p>

<p>Despite the <a title="Etymology" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEtymology&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9eL1ifXrsvUsD2aAV63VZJ8bo1A" target="_blank">origin</a> of the term from the <a title="Ancient Greek" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAncient_Greek&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEKWSOqBEM_STiDHSGcy63CRb0PSQ" target="_blank">Greek</a> roots “<i>skhizein” which means</i> &#8220;to split&#8221;, schizophrenia does not imply a &#8220;multiple personality disorder.”  The term means a &#8220;splitting of mental functions.”  You might say that someone suffering from a multiple personality disorder walks around with an endless number of “distinct” persons in his or her head.  All of them compete for dominance.  All of them create chaos in that person’s mind.</p>
<p>Enter the term “multiculturalism” where multiple cultures reside in the same country.   Ultimately cultures conflict with one another via people, passions and language.</p>
<p><a title="Jonathan H. Turner" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJonathan_H._Turner&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEAybeFrUyI_XN2dAjss8pQCyVqXA" target="_blank">Jonathan H. Turner</a> defines it as a conflict caused by &#8220;differences in <a title="Culture" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCulture&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGU5LgCmmlUbeyY33uAATGv63CeQA" target="_blank">cultural</a> <a title="Value (personal and cultural)" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FValue_%2528personal_and_cultural%2529&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHL73EVApyuuXGZzyCOWcWwHmyEA" target="_blank">values</a> and <a title="Belief" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBelief&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1Qmzn-yV07ZFPBVtE1wqC4w5xmA" target="_blank">beliefs</a><wbr></wbr> that place people at odds with one another&#8221;. He defines this conflict as, “One that occurs when peoples’ expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met.  They face others that possess different cultural backgrounds and different expectations.”</p>
<p>We proved that cultures don’t mix when we usurped the Native American Indians of North America.  They have not integrated into the white man’s culture whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Cultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs,” said Turner.  “Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in <a title="Politics" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPolitics&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzv_OuriiecYpuFuk8FaLbIiVqXA" target="_blank">politics</a>, particularly on a macro level.  An example of cultural conflict is <a title="Abortion debate" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbortion_debate&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqi14-tEaBI25C6NUa77NvNNHdlg" target="_blank">the debate</a> over <a title="Abortion" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAbortion&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgEhH1VH7wQaZKS-rHEvmCd7_52Q" target="_blank">abortion</a>.  <a title="Ethnic cleansing" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEthnic_cleansing&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7eMSsKpDe6zXCx4kkafSpz_X8Kg" target="_blank">Ethnic cleansing</a> is another extreme example of cultural conflict. Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict.”</p>
<p>The African-Americans versus European-American conflict rages in the United States without pause from 1776 to 2013.  No amount of laws, education, forced integration, police or legal consequences stop racial discrimination, racial bias, racism or violence.</p>
<p>Whether in the NFL two weeks ago with one black and one white player fighting over race or the Zimmerman-Martin killing or voting a black president into the White House—Americans fail to resolve the racial-cultural divide that permeates every city in America where blacks, Mexicans and whites mix.</p>
<p>Today, blacks in big cities practice a new game where they “Knockout” a white person from behind with a hammer or 2&#215;4 board.  “Black flash mobs” run around major US cities looting stores and killing white people. They take a video of their kills and boast on You Tube.  Much the same occurred in the 80s, 90s and last decade with blacks car- jacking whites in Detroit, Michigan at stoplights.  Whites fled to the tune of over 1.0 million over 20 years. Their flight dropped Detroit from 1.85 million to its current 680,000 today—over 90 percent Arabic-Black minority.</p>
<p>Illegal alien Mexican migrants attempt to fight their way into America demanding we suspend our laws in favor of legalizing their lawlessness. As their numbers continue to grow, we can expect violent demonstrations. They demand Americans speak Spanish and wherever Mexicans command dominant numbers, Americans must teach Mexican kids in Spanish. Mexican racism runs deep and virulent.</p>
<p>If you look at Norway, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Belgium and Holland today, you see the results of multiculturalism turning their countries into “Schizophrenic societies.”  All of them see major crime waves of rapes, murders, shoplifting, bursting prisons, schools in chaos, enclaving of entire cities into cultural ghettos, language changes, cultural changes and loss of societal cohesiveness.  Belgium, once all-European, will become an Islamic caliphate within four decades.  Its culture and language face ultimate displacement by its Islamic immigrants.</p>
<p>Of special note, Swedish women can no longer walk down the streets of Stockholm by themselves for fear of being accosted, raped or murdered by Muslim immigrant males.  Same in Norway and in France where Muslims dominate a specific enclave!</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, Holland and France face similar fates.</p>
<p>Within 37 years, the United States faces becoming a “Schizophrenic Society” with 100 million immigrants streaming into its borders from 150 countries around the world.  Some cultures will create and harbor their own in ghettos like the ones they fled.  Others will compete for dominance like the Islamic immigrants as they follow the prime directive of their Koran—“You must convert or kill all non-believers, especially the Jews.”</p>
<p>As this series winds down as to what America will look like in 2050, you cannot help but cringe at the loss of your own language, culture and way of life.  You may be sickened at what you see already occurring across America in Mexican ghettoes like Los Angeles, Houston and along the border with “colonias” that reek of third world misery.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to see our country turned into a schizophrenic cultural quagmire, call Speaker of the House John Boehner at <a href="tel:1%20202%20225%200600" target="_blank">1 202 225 0600</a>:</p>
<p>“Mr. Boehner, I understand that S744 doubles legal immigration from its current 1.0 million annually to 2.0 million while giving amnesty to 12 to 20 million illegal migrants. Do you understand that such an amnesty would flood America with over 100 million immigrants by 2050—a scant 37 years from now. How will we be able to water, house, work, feed, educate, medicate and care for that many people when we already suffer 48 million Americans who cannot secure jobs and live on food stamps? How will we maintain our environment and standard of living in light of those numbers. As an American citizen, I demand that you reduce all immigration to less than 100,000 annually and enforce the laws on the books to arrest, prosecute and jail employers of illegal migrants. That will help illegal migrants to go home on their own dime when they don’t have a job. Our own unemployed citizens can take those jobs at a living wage.”</p>
<p>Also: call your own U.S. Senators and leave the same message.</p>

<p><em><strong>“Men (people) are rarely aware of the real reasons which motivate their actions.” </strong>— Edward Bernays, Propaganda, 1928</em></p>
<p>The winter holidays are traditionally supposed to embody a certain ideal of that which is best in the hearts of human beings. As the world around us retreats into ice and snow and the Earth’s northern cycle returns to death once again, the holidays represent a time of contemplation, as well as an opportunity to shine a light in an otherwise dark and dreary period. This heritage is as old as history, dating back to an era in which agriculture was paramount and men garnered far more respect for the tides of nature. The parallel relationship between social “renewal” and seasonal renewal has served the collective psyche of Western society, in my view, for the better. Unfortunately, this process has all but vanished today, twisted and mutilated into something sinister and poisonous.</p>
<p>Those of us who pay attention are well aware of a trend of cultural decline within our nation, and this problem is disturbingly visible from Thanksgiving to Christmas. It’s not just the highly publicized Black Friday (now Black Thursday) riots over semi-cheap Chinese-made garbage. Those are certainly vile examples:</p>
<p>Rather, it’s the behavior of people throughout the season on a daily basis that is most disconcerting. I have personally witnessed, as I’m sure many people have, a magnified and astonishing disregard for conscience and basic decency growing worse each year for at least the past decade. That which is most unsettling about our society today is somehow unleashed with wild abandon every year at this time.</p>
<p>The idiocy and barbarism seems to span all economic “classes” — from the upper-middle-class snob screaming at bewildered cashiers over a coupon worth 50 cents, to the middle-class suburbanites brawling on the sticky floors of Wal-Mart over flat-screen TVs, to the part-time employee who sold her soul for minimum wage and who now yells at people on Thanksgiving eve to stop filming the mindless brawls that her corporate masters encourage because such videos might “reflect badly” on the company image. The dark side truly knows no social or financial bounds.</p>
<p>Every year, we see this behavior, shake our heads in dismay and look forward to the beginning of January, when Americans go back to being only moderately disdainful toward each other. This time, however, instead of merely gawking in disbelief at the circus sideshow, I would like to challenge people to explore more deeply the true motivations of the mob itself, as well as the motivations of the elitists who manipulate the mob for their own purposes. Let’s take a look at the fundamental dynamics of the psychology of mobs and the madness of crowds.</p>
<p><strong>Filling The Emptiness</strong></p>
<p>In my recent article &#8216;<a href="http://personalliberty.com/2013/11/19/you-should-feel-sorry-for-sheeple-heres-why/"><em>You Should Feel Sorry For Sheeple; Here’s Why&#8217;</em></a>, I outline the inner life, or rather the lack of inner life, common to the average sheeple. Many of my compatriots find it increasingly difficult to muster any pity for the sheeple subculture, and I can see why. When given ample opportunity, sheeple always sink toward the worst humanity has to offer usually in an effort to aggrandize themselves.</p>
<p>But let’s set aside that sick feeling in our stomachs when thinking of sheeple and really consider what their existence is like. What does a sheeple’s daily life consist of?</p>
<p>In most cases I&#8217;ve observed, he lives what he believes to be the American dream. He wakes up in the morning swelling with superficial concerns of personal gain, scheming ways in which he can raise his perceived stature among the other sheeple around him. He then then travels to his place of employment, usually a job he hates, in order to accumulate enough wealth (scraps from the plates of government and corporate financiers) to buy all the “things” he assumes everyone else wants. In the process, he pawns off his children to state-run schools designed to crush their spirits; and he becomes estranged from his spouse, who begins to forget why they ever got married in the first place. He returns home physically and emotionally drained, knowing that he did nothing worthwhile with his time, only to sit apathetically in front of his television for a few hours being bombarded with cancerous marketing propaganda and barely talking with the family he tells himself he works so hard for.</p>
<p>Think about it. Think of the pitch-black void that his life has become. Think of all the abandoned dreams, all the missed opportunities for experience and joy, all the moments of reflection and self-education that were missed because he was “too busy” trying to elevate himself within the ranks of a heartless collective.</p>
<p>Now, for one frightening moment, imagine this is your life. No sense of legitimate pride or individualism. No understanding of the underlying events that affect your environment or the high-placed people who determine your future. No thoughts outside the mainstream box. No recognition of possible alternative ways to live or how to break free. No hope for tomorrow but the endless drudgery of today’s mediocrity. Think of the unconscious rage you would have brewing inside like a putrid ball of sulfur and magma.</p>
<p>This rage is what sheeple use to fill the emptiness inside themselves once they subconsciously realize that no amount of frivolous consumerism will make them whole. Typically, they are on constant lookout for opportunities to vent their anger at unsuspecting victims in drive-by fashion.</p>
<p>Somehow, the holidays appear to have become a prime period of opportunity during which society opens the door for the dark side to come out and for sheeple to passively or not-so-passively project their failings onto others. For now, we might presume that this behavior is somewhat contained and relegated to particular moments of seasonal insanity, but the consequences of the willfully ignorant strata of American culture could go far beyond what most morally conscious people want to predict.</p>
<p><strong>The Psychopath Next Door</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“If thirty years ago anyone had dared to predict that our psychological development was tending towards a revival of the medieval persecutions of the Jews, that Europe would again tremble before the Roman fasces and the tramp of legions, that people would once more give the Roman salute, as two thousand years ago, and that instead of the Christian Cross an archaic swastika would lure onward millions of warriors ready for death — why, that man would have been hooted at as a mystical fool.” </strong>— Carl Jung, Archetypes And The Collective Unconscious, 1938</em></p>
<p>In his book, <a href="http://luizfernando.info/pbd/The%20Undiscovered%20Self%20-%20Carl%20Gustav%20Jung.pdf" target="_blank"><em>The Undiscovered Self</em></a>, one of the fathers of modern psychology, Carl Gustav Jung, discusses the tension-filled relationship between the individual versus the collective and the state. In particular, he studies how individuals become swallowed up in the actions of the collective mob and how this momentum invariably leads to mass atrocities that defy imagination. A point of primary importance in Jung’s work is his discovery that at least 10 percent of any population at any given time is made up of individuals with latent psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies. Meaning, at least one out of every 10 random people around you today was born with the capacity for psychopathic behavior, including the ability to completely ignore inherent conscience.</p>
<p>The idea that one out of every 10 people near you might suddenly burst into an overwhelming animalistic blood fever is, of course, terrifying to many people. But generally, latent psychopathy in a person does not surface in immediately recognizable ways; and many people with that potential live their entire lives without ever acting on it. Some even come to terms with it through self-awareness and dispel it altogether. Problems arise, though, as Jung warned, when a society creates an environment in which emotionally or physically violent psychopathic acts become “acceptable” to the collective. That is to say, individual latent psychopaths and sociopaths are not so much a danger on their own; but when they get together in an organization or mob, the terrible floodgates open.</p>
<p>During national crisis, or during great ideological shifts towards collectivism, the 10 percent are given ample opportunity to act out their inner impulses. The corrupt state will often give latent psychopaths free reign or seek them out for positions of petty authority, leaving the gates to hell ajar, as it were.</p>
<p>Another dangerous reality is that these same people tend to pursue positions of authority, or they unconsciously gravitate toward events and situations that allow them to act on their darker side without facing consequences. One might even suggest that there will always be a potential for despotic regimes exactly because the 10 percent will likely always be around to be used as a weapon by dictatorships.</p>
<p>The mass rage and self-absorption we witness during the holidays feels ominous to us because it is just a glimpse of the greater shadow side of the American public. It is a glimpse of the kind of mentality that makes all human catastrophe possible. Like the tip of a shark fin cutting the surface of the water, we swim fearing not the dorsal, but the monster we KNOW it is connected to.</p>
<p><strong>The Magicians Of Manufactured Consent<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Jung, once a favorite of Sigmund Freud’s, broke sharply with Freud’s analytical school when he realized Freud would not accept the idea of inherent psychological properties beyond base instincts. Freud believed that conscience, morality, artistic ability, reason, etc. were all extensions of environment and experience. Freud’s theories on psychology focused on the idea that man was driven by base animal urges at his core, that people have no complex inborn contents and that all one needed to do was manipulate his environment to make himself “healthy.” Jung’s studies proved otherwise, finding that there are vast layers of inborn knowledge and personality in every individual.</p>
<p>It was not until Freud was near death that he admitted the merit of Jung’s work. Jung was shunned by the mainstream and labeled everything from a “charlatan” to an “anti-Semite” because of his opposition to the Freudian method.</p>
<p>Some industrious elites did find Freud’s notions of environmental manipulation useful, though, including his nephew, Edward Bernays, who saw it not as a way to make people healthy, but rather, to make them unhealthy. Bernays wrote extensively on the use of propaganda to control what he called “herd instinct,” believing (as most elitists believe) that self-governance of common people was “dangerous” and that the irrational public had to be controlled for their own good and the good of the nation. His entire philosophy is summed up in this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8220;The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. … We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. … In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons… who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Bernays was instrumental in promoting Freudian psychology in the United States, where it became the mainstay of universities across the country. He helped establish the Tavistock Institute, a globalist think-tank much like the Council On Foreign Relations, focused on molding public opinion. He was also instrumental in promoting psychological propaganda models in everyday corporate marketing and political campaigns. He called this “engineering consent.”</p>
<p>It was Bernays who taught the marketing world how to appeal to the basest instincts of human beings and to use those instinctual desires to covertly control them. Corporations used Bernays’ strategies to create an atmosphere of decadent consumption in America that has lasted since the end of World War II. The idea was simple: Convince the public that buying corporate products will satisfy their animal urges. All commercialism to this day revolves around this method (which is why almost every beer commercial for several decades has included scantily clad women or sexual innuendo, for example).</p>
<p>But Bernays was not only teaching corporations how to tap into existing human impulses, he was also teaching corporations and governments how to use psychological trickery to manipulate the citizenry to RELY on their basest impulses. Essentially, Bernays taught the establishment how to convince people, or shame people, into ignoring their greater selves and indulging their psychopathic and sociopathic urges. Bernays taught the establishment how to turn people into zombies.</p>
<p>We see the clear results today all around us as we enter into the absurdity that Christmas has become. The ramifications are dire. The holidays have come to represent not hope, but despair; not reflection, but callowness; not compassion, but narcissism and selfishness. They have become a yearly measure of our Nation’s sharp fall into something more or less horrific, something ironically inhuman.</p>
<p>The only solution is to strive with everything we have to remind others, and ourselves, that we are more than the sum of our darker instincts. That we have been living in the midst of a carefully crafted lie meant to make us impotent and non-threatening to the establishment. That there are greater and more meaningful contents at our core, and these elements of our being can only be satisfied by one thing: the truth.</p>

			<p><em>The following is the text of a talk I gave at the <a href="http://seekspeakspreadtruth.com/">Seek, Speak and Spread Truth Conference</a> in London last Saturday, 23 November, 2013.</em></p>
<p>History, we are told, is an attempt to narrate the past. But in reality, more than often history has little to do with revealing the past. It is instead an orchestrated and institutional attempt to shove the shame deep under the carpet.</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="http://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/993938_183181721854321_1636241837_n.jpg" width="232" height="246" />Much Jewish history texts, for instance, are there to divert the attention from the peculiar and tragic fact that along their history, Jews have managed to bring on themselves an endless chain of disasters. But Palestinian history at large,  is no different. After more than a century of liberation struggle, the situation in Palestine is worse than ever, yet Palestinian scholarship, as we will soon see, is drifting away from any possible understanding of the circumstances that led to their ongoing disaster.</p>
<p>Although the Brits have many war crimes attached to their names, the British Imperial War Museum decided to allocate a whole floor to the <a href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/exhibitions/iwm-london/the-holocaust-exhibition">Jewish Holocaust</a> instead of featuring one of the British-made genocides. The Brits, like everyone else, prefer to conceal their shame.</p>
<p>Historical accounts are commonly there to suppress the truth and conceal our shame. Yet, it is far from clear who is in charge, who decides what must be covered up and which path must be taken in order to suppress the truth.</p>
<p>Apparently, restricting the terminology and limiting freedom of expression by means of (political) correctness are probably amongst the most popular methods. Sadly enough, Palestine solidarity discourse is a spectacular test case in that regard.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>A brief examination of each of the terminological pillars and the principles that shape our vision of the conflict, of its history and of its possible solution are there to conceal the obvious causes, ideologies and belief system that drive the crimes in the Middle East in general and in Palestine in particular.</p>
<h2>Zoom In</h2>
<p>We’ll now scrutinize the terminology and notions that are involved in the debate over Palestine and expose once again the deceitful nature that is unfortunately intrinsic to the contemporary progressive discourse.</p>
<p><strong>Zionism</strong> – Palestinian solidarity members are required to avoid the ‘J’ word and to use the word &#8216;Zionism&#8217; instead. I recently revealed that Ali Abunimah, one of my current arch detractors, advised me a few years ago to <a href="http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/why-when-and-how-ali-abunimah-asked-me-to-lie-for-the-cause.html">refer to Zion when I really think Jewish</a> so he and I “might find grounds for a lot of agreement….” In fact  Abunimah was not alone. Jewish Voice For Peace approached me with a pretty much similar offer about the same time.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that Israeli politics has little to do with Zionism. Israelis  are hardly familiar with Zionist ideology, nor they are concerned or motivated by Zionist praxis.  Zionism is largely a Jewish Diaspora discourse that vows to establish a Jewish National home in Palestine  and to civilize the Jew by means of nationalism. Israel is obviously the product of the Zionist project; however, the Israelis see themselves as post-revolutionary subjects &#8211; they transformed the Zionist dream into a practical reality.</p>
<p>Thus, criticism of Zionism <em>per se</em> hardly touches Israelis or Israeli politics. If anything, it actually diverts the attention from the crimes that are committed by the Jewish State in the name of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>But then, why do we use the term Zionism instead of referring to Jewish power, Jewish politics or the Jewish State?  Simple: we do not want to offend the ‘anti-Zionist&#8217; Jews and Jews in general. We consciously choose to let Israel off the hook. Apparently we much prefer to target a phantasmic imaginary object that means very little rather than simply calling spade a spade.</p>
<p><strong>Colonialism</strong> - Palestinian solidarity activists are expected to pepper their sentences with different permutations of the word &#8216;colonial&#8217; with the hope that the more they use it the more it is likely to stick eventually. Consequently, activists and scholars commonly refer to Israel and Zionism as a ‘colonial project’. But they are obviously wrong.</p>
<p>Colonialism is traditionally defined as a clear material exchange between a ‘mother State’ and a ‘settler State’. Israel is no doubt a settler state, yet, no one can suggest who exactly was or is her mother.*</p>
<p>So why do we refer to Israel and Zionism as a colonial project? Simple: it saves us from admitting that the Jewish national project is indeed a unique project with no precedent in history. It would save us from admitting that we do not understand this project nor do we know where it aims. The Left and the so-called ‘anti-Zionist&#8217; Jews cling to the colonial paradigm because it locates Israel and Zionism within a model they and their audience are slightly familiar with. The colonial paradigm suggests that the Jewish national project is as vicious as the British or French colonialism. But the grave truth is that we are dealing here with a unique form of abusive nationalist, racist project.</p>
<p><strong>Settler Colonialism</strong> – in recent years a new terminological spin popped up within the Palestine solidarity ranks, namely ‘settler colonialism.’ I guess that my criticism of the colonial paradigm has shaken a few of the so-called progressive and ‘anti’ Zionists intellectuals, and they were pushed to revise their theoretical narrative. Their effort brought to the world a new deformed dysfunctional theoretical baby. But sadly enough, ‘settler colonialism’ also hardly explains a thing. It is rather a desperate attempt to further conceal the truth of the Jewish National project.</p>
<p>Settler Colonialism refers to the situation in which Super Power ‘A’ facilitates the settlement of Ethnic Group ‘B’ on Land ‘C’. Such an event may lead eventually to some grave consequences as far as indigenous population ‘D’ is concerned.</p>
<p>But here is the problem. This historical scenario A-B-C-D has nothing in common with Zionism, Israel or the Israeli Palestinian conflict. In reality, it was Zionists (B) who actually persuaded Britain, at the time a super power (A), that a Jewish Homeland in Palestine (C) is the right way forward. It was also Zionists (B) who promised to help pushing America into World War One that led Lord Balfour to commit the British empire (A) to the Zionist cause. In short, instead of the A-B-C-D chain of events, when it comes to Zionism, what we easily detect is a B-A-C-D chronology. It is the ethnic group ‘B’ that pushes Super Power ‘A’ to act in its favour.</p>
<p>But then we may want to ask ourselves why is it that Palestinian solidarity activists such as <a href="http://benwhite.org.uk/tag/apartheid/">Ben White</a> are consciously lying when they speaks about <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2013/11/american-speaking-opposition.html">“settler-colonial past and present.”</a><em>  </em>Unfortunately White is not alone, the list of academics and scholars who participate in the dissemination of this false narrative is pretty <a href="http://soaspalsoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SOASPALSOC-7th-Settler-Colonialism-2011.pdf"><em>impressive</em></a>.</p>
<p>Why do they deceive, is it because they are an ignorant bunch? Not at all, they are actually dedicated scholars, it is just intellectual integrity that they lack, and severely.</p>
<p>Spreading the ‘settler colonialism’  narrative is, once again, intended to divert the attention from the embarrassing fact that already in 1917 the Jewish Lobby was amongst the strongest lobbies in the land. Such an admission could easily offend many Jews within the Palestine solidarity movement. Seemingly, we really do not want to offend anyone but intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Apartheid</strong> – Solidarity activists are inclined to refer to Israel as an apartheid state. They obviously let the Jewish State off the hook. Apartheid is commonly defined as a racially driven system of exploitation. But Israel is not Apartheid, it is not interested in exploitation. Israel is far worse, it wants the Palestinians gone. Israel is a racially driven, nationalist ethnic cleanser. In that regard, Israel is very similar to Nazi Germany. But this is exactly the equation we are supposed to avoid because it may hurt the Jews and even confuse the Left.</p>
<p><strong>Two State / One State Debate</strong> – The philosophy behind the ‘one state solution’ is obviously ethical and universal.  But there is one slight problem. It finds no political partners or supporters within the Israeli society. Why? Because Israel is the Jewish State and the notion of Peace is totally foreign to Israeli and Jewish culture. The word ‘Shalom’ that is commonly translated as peace, reconciliation and harmony, is understood in Hebrew as ‘security for the Jews’.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it was very embarrassing to read Palestinian prominent intellectual Joseph Massad make some gross mistakes misinterpreting the word ‘peace’ in the context of the Zionist ideology and Israeli politics.</p>
<p>In a recent article named Peace Is War: Israeli settler-colonialism and the Palestinians <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/10/peace-war-israeli-settler-colonialism-palestinians-20131031113553103874.html">Massad wrote</a>:  “Waging <em>war as peace</em> is so central to Zionist and Israeli propaganda that Israel&#8217;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which killed 20,000 civilians, was termed ‘Operation Peace for Galilee’”.</p>
<p>If Massad had committed to proper scholarship he would probably find out that, as far as Israelis are concerned, operation ‘<em>Shlom Ha-Galil</em>’ really meant ‘security’ for the Galilee rather than ‘Peace for Galilee’. Massad could have saved himself this intellectual blunder if he had read <em>The Wandering Who</em> rather than attempting to burn the book, whose author actually delves into the topic occasionally.</p>

<p>Israelis would support the One State Solution as long as it is One Jewish State. As Paul Larudee suggested recently, the Israelis would also support the Two State Solution as long as it is Two Jewish States.   Yet the only question that bugs me is, why would a Palestinian blogger such as Ali Abunimah  go out of his way to stop us from looking into the tribal and racist culture that drives the Jewish State?</p>

<p>Is it possible that some of the prominent Palestine voices also do not want to offend the Jews? I will let you judge.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Palestinian Cause</strong></p>
<p>Is it really the Right of Return?  or 1948? For many years I was convinced that the Nakba was at the core of the Palestinian plight. But then monitoring BDS Movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanction of Israeli goods, culture and academia) politics taught me that I could have been deluded.</p>
<p>When BDS was formed in 2005 this was <a href="http://www.bdsmovement.net/call">its first goal</a>:</p>
<p>1.<strong> Ending its (Israeli) occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall; (2005)</strong></p>
<p>But then, without any attempt to discuss the matter publicly, BDS headquarters in Ramallah changed its first goal. <a href="http://www.bdsmovement.net/bdsintro">It now reads</a>:</p>
<p>1.<strong> Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands occupied in June 1967 and dismantling the Wall;</strong></p>
<p>Some efforts have been made to make sure that Palestinian organisations are aware of this crucial change. Adding the 1967 made it clear that BDS <em>de facto</em> accepted the existence of a Jewish State over Palestine.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, not many Palestinians were really outraged by BDS dropping the 1948 and accepting Israel as a fact. I guess that the meaning of it is simple. As far as Palestinians in exile in the West  are concerned, 1948 and  the Right of Return are not the real topic. I guess that such an agenda is not driven by the concern for the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon or Syria. I assume that refugees in Gaza and Jenin may also be outraged but, as things stand,  we can hardly hear their voices anyway. I guess that BDS is there to appease the ‘Jews in the movement’ and even liberal Zionists. This is hardly surprising considering the embarrassing fact that liberal Zionist George Soros who funds the Light Zionist J-Street also funds BDS as well as many other Palestinian NGOs.</p>
<h2>Zoom Out</h2>
<p>As we can see; Zionism, Colonialism, Settler-Colonialism, Apartheid, BDS and even The One State Solution are all misleading concepts and they are shaped to not offend the anti Zionist Jews and even Jews in general. This surreal and macabre political act explains why the solidarity movement has failed to deliver on every and each front, except one of course. With the support of liberal Zionists such as Soros, Palestine solidarity is now a little industrial affair that is pretty successful in maintaining itself. The absurd outcome is that the newly emerging Palestine solidarity industry actually benefits from the constant escalation of the crisis in Palestine &#8211; the worse is the situation on the ground, the more funding is pumped through the industry.</p>
<p>I guess that if we want to grasp what is behind this constant regression, concealment and repression are obviously the key words.</p>
<p>Concealment and repression lead towards stagnation. This is exactly what we see in Palestine and for more than a while &#8211; 100 years of struggle that led to a complete failure. Palestinian Solidarity is now farther than ever from understanding Zionism, Israel and the conflict. The so-called ‘movement’ is entrenched within a muddy terminological swamp that results in intellectual and spiritual paralysis.</p>
<p>This is exactly the point where truth and truth seeking come into play. The role of the intellectual and the artist is to unveil the concealed. To look into the pain and to dig into the essence. This search for essentiality is similar to the role of the psychoanalyst who delves into the realm of the unconscious.</p>
<p>When it comes to Palestine we have to grasp, once and for all, what the Jewish State stands for. We have to understand what Judaism and Jewishness are. We have to grasp who are the Jews, what unifies them and vice versa. We must learn the relationships between these distinct categories and Zionism and only then may we be ready to form some pragmatic and practical thoughts on Zionism, the Jewish State and its lobbies. By the time we are ready to do so, we may as well grasp the role of Jews-Only groups within the solidarity ‘movement’. We may comprehend how they have been shaping the discourse and suppressing the truth by dominating our language and restricting our intellectual liberties. By the time we are familiar with Jewish tribal culture ideology and politics, we may as well grasp the role of the ‘<em>Sabbath Goy</em>’, the caretaker who performs the services Jews prefer to leave to the<em>Goyim</em>.</p>
<p>But our role doesn’t end there. We also must grasp what Palestine means. How is it possible that Palestine scholarship is withdrawing rather than progressing. How is it possible that in the 70’s Palestinians were the world&#8217;s leading guerrilla fighters but not anymore. What happened and why?   What is it that the Palestinians want?  Can we even talk about Palestinians or are they a fragmented society that is split geographically, culturally, spiritually, politically and ideologically? And if they are divided, who is it that keeps them divided? Is there anything that can unite them?</p>
<p>I believe that the Jewish progressive politics together with the non-dialectic Left are to be blamed for this political disaster and terminological impotence. We are dealing with a concealment apparatus that forsakes the future just to sustain a remote echo of a decaying 19th ideology. It is there to nourish the forgetting of Being. It is there to make us aloof to the grave reality we are living in by means of intellectual and spiritual suppression.</p>
<p>When 1984’s Orwell wrote about Newspeak, he had Britain in mind. He foresaw the devastating impact of the so-called progressive minds around him. He could predict where The Guardians of correctness might be leading us all. And, for a reason, he made Immanuel Goldstein, the imaginary false dissent icon.</p>
<p>My message to you today is simple &#8211; true liberation is the ability to learn how to think, to learn how to be intrigued and irritated. Liberation is to unveil the concealed, to think and re-think, to view, re-view and revise.  To think is to aim at the essence, at the bottom of things, at the categorical. To think is to be able to distinguish between the symptoms and the disease.  Liberation is to burn bridges compulsively and enthusiastically and to bear the consequences. Liberation is to pursue truth relentlessly. This is exactly the moment when pain becomes pleasure.</p>
