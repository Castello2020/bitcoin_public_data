<p>There’s something that doesn’t ring-true about the coverage of crisis in Iraq. Maybe it’s the way the media reiterates the same, tedious storyline over and over again with only the slightest changes in the narrative. For example, I was reading an article in the Financial Times by Council on Foreign Relations president, Richard Haass, where he says that Maliki’s military forces in Mosul “melted away”. Interestingly, the Haass op-ed was followed by a piece by David Gardener who used almost the very same language. He said the “army melts away.” So, I decided to thumb through the news a bit and see how many other journalists were stung by the “melted away” bug. And, as it happens, there were quite a few, including Politico, NBC News, News Sentinel, Global Post, the National Interest, ABC News etc. Now, the only way an unusual expression like that would pop up with such frequency would be if the authors were getting their talking points from a central authority. (which they probably do.) But the effect, of course, is the exact opposite than what the authors intend, that is, these cookie cutter stories leave readers scratching their heads and feeling like something fishy is going on.</p>
<p>And something fishy IS going on. The whole fable about 1,500 jihadis scaring the pants off 30,000 Iraqi security guards to the point where they threw away their rifles, changed their clothes and headed for the hills, is just not believable. I don’t know what happened in Mosul, but, I’ll tell you one thing, it wasn’t that. That story just doesn’t pass the smell test.</p>
<p>And what happened in Mosul matters too, because nearly every journalist and pundit in the MSM is using the story to discredit Maliki and suggest that maybe Iraq would be better off without him. Haass says that it shows that the army’s “allegiance to the government is paper thin”. Gardener says its a sign of “a fast failing state.” Other op-ed writers like Nicolas Kristof attack Maliki for other reasons, like being too sectarian. Here’s Kristof:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The debacle in Iraq isn’t President Obama’s fault. It’s not the Republicans’ fault. Both bear some responsibility, but, overwhelmingly, it’s the fault of the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri Kamal al-Maliki.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Kristof is no match for the imperial mouthpiece, Tom Friedman. When it comes to pure boneheaded bluster, Friedman is still numero uno. Here’s how the jowly pundit summed it up in an article in the Sunday Times titled “Five Principles for Iraq”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Iraq’s Shiite prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, has proved himself not to be a friend of a democratic, pluralistic Iraq either. From Day 1, he has used his office to install Shiites in key security posts, drive out Sunni politicians and generals and direct money to Shiite communities. In a word, Maliki has been a total jerk. Besides being prime minister, he made himself acting minister of defense, minister of the interior and national security adviser, and his cronies also control the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry.</p>
<p>Maliki had a choice — to rule in a sectarian way or in an inclusive way — and he chose sectarianism. We owe him nothing.” (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/opinion/sunday/thomas-friedman-5-principles-for-iraq.html?hp&amp;rref=opinion&amp;_r=0">Five Principles for Iraq</a>, Tom Freidman, New York Times)</p></blockquote>
<p>Leave it to Friedman, eh? In other words, the reason Iraq is such a mess, has nothing to do with the invasion, the occupation, the death squads, Abu Ghraib, the Salvador Option, the decimated infrastructure, the polluted environment, or the vicious sectarian war the US ignited with its demented counterinsurgency program. Oh, no. The reason Iraq is a basketcase is because Maliki is a jerk. Maliki is sectarian. Bad Maliki.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Putin last week. Maliki this week. Who’s next?</p>
<p>In any event, there is a rational explanation for what happened in Mosul although I cannot verify its authenticity. Check out this post at Syria Perspectives blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…the Iraqi Ba’ath Party’s primary theoretician and Saddam’s right-hand man, ‘Izzaat Ibraaheem Al-Douri, himself a native of Mosul…was searching out allies in a very hostile post-Saddam Iraq … Still on the run and wanted for execution by the Al-Maliki government, Al-Douri still controlled a vast network of Iraqi Sunni Ba’athists who operated in a manner similar to the old Odessa organization that helped escaped Nazis after WWII … he did not have the support structure needed to oust Al-Maliki, so, he found an odd alliance in ISIS through the offices of Erdoghan and Bandar. Our readers should note that the taking of Mosul was accomplished by former Iraqi Ba’athist officers suspiciously abandoning their posts and leaving a 52,000 man military force without any leadership thereby forcing a complete collapse of the city’s defenses. The planning and collaboration cannot be coincidental.” (<a href="http://www.syrianperspective.com/2014/06/the-inner-core-of-isis-the-invasive-species.html#HyP9LsIS8WQpA3FV.99">THE INNER CORE OF ISIS – THE INVASIVE SPECIES</a>, Ziad Fadel, Syrian Perspectives)</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve read variations of this same explanation on other blogs, but I have no way of knowing whether they’re true or not. But what I do know, is that it’s a heckuva a lot more believable than the other explanation mainly because it provides enough background and detail to make the scenario seem plausible. The official version–the “melts away” version– doesn’t do that at all. It just lays out this big bogus story expecting people to believe it on faith alone. Why? Because it appeared in all the papers?</p>
<p>That seems like a particularly bad reason for believing anything.</p>
<p>And the “army melting away” story is just one of many inconsistencies in the official media version of events. Another puzzler is why Obama allowed the jihadis to rampage across Iraq without lifting a finger to help. Does that strike anyone else as a bit odd?</p>
<p>When was the last time an acting president failed to respond immediately and forcefully to a similar act of aggression?</p>
<p>Never. The US always responds. And the pattern is always the same. “Stop what you are doing now or we’re going to bomb you to smithereens.” Isn’t that the typical response?</p>
<p>Sure it is. But Obama delivered no such threat this time. Instead, he’s qualified his support for al-Maliki saying that the beleaguered president must “begin accommodating Sunni participation in his government” before the US will lend a hand. What kind of lame response is that? Check out this blurb from MNI News:</p>
<blockquote><p>“President Barack Obama Friday warned Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki that the United States wants him to begin accommodating Sunni participation in his government, or see the United States withhold the help he needs, short of U.S. troops on the ground, to ward off an attack on Baghdad.</p>
<p>Obama added the emphasis of an appearance before TV cameras to his midday message, that while he will be considering options for some military intervention in the days ahead, the next move is up to Maliki.”<br />
(<a href="https://mninews.marketnews.com/index.php/obama-warns-iraqs-malikilooking-sunni-shia-accommodation?q=content/obama-warns-iraqs-malikilooking-sunni-shia-accommodation">Obama Warns Iraq’s Maliki,Looking for Sunni-Shia Accommodation</a>, MNI)</p></blockquote>
<p>Have you ever read such nonsense in your life? Imagine if , let’s say, the jihadi hordes had gathered just 50 miles outside of London and were threatening to invade at any minute. Do you think Obama would deliver the same message to UK Prime Minister David Cameron?</p>
<p>“Gee, Dave, we’d really like to help out, but you need to put a couple of these guys in your government first. Would that be okay, Dave? Just think of it as affirmative action for terrorists.”</p>
<p>It might sound crazy, but that’s what Obama wants Maliki to do. So, what’s going on here? Why is Obama delivering ultimatums when he should be helping out? Could it be that Obama has a different agenda than Maliki’s and that the present situation actually works to his benefit?</p>
<p>It sure looks that way. Just take a look at what Friedman says further on in the same article. It helps to clarify the point. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Maybe Iran, and its wily Revolutionary Guards Quds Force commander, Gen. Qassem Suleimani, aren’t so smart after all. It was Iran that armed its Iraqi Shiite allies with the specially shaped bombs that killed and wounded many American soldiers. Iran wanted us out. It was Iran that pressured Maliki into not signing an agreement with the U.S. to give our troops legal cover to stay in Iraq. Iran wanted to be the regional hegemon. Well, Suleimani: “This Bud’s for you.” Now your forces are overextended in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, and ours are back home. Have a nice day.” (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/opinion/sunday/thomas-friedman-5-principles-for-iraq.html?hp&amp;rref=opinion&amp;_r=0">5 Principles for Iraq</a>, Tom Friedman, New York Times)</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting, eh? Friedman basically admits that this whole fiasco is about Iran who turned out to be the biggest winner in the Iraq War sweepstakes. Naturally, that pisses off people in Washington, Tel Aviv and Riyadh to no end, so they’ve cooked up this goofy plan to either remove Maliki altogether or significantly trim his wings. Isn’t that what’s going on? And that’s why Obama is holding a gun to Maliki’s head and telling him what hoops he has to jump through in order to get US help. Because he’s determined to weaken Iran’s hegemonic grip on Baghdad.</p>
<p>Friedman also notes the Status of Forces agreement which would have allowed U.S. troops to stay in Iraq. Al Maliki rejected the deal which enraged Washington setting the stage for this latest terrorist farce. Obama intends to reverse that decision by hook or crook. This is just the way Washington does business, by twisting arms and breaking legs. Everybody knows this.</p>
<p>To understand what’s going on today in Iraq, we need to know a little history. In 2002, The Bush administration commissioned the Rand Corporation “to develop a Shaping Strategy for pacifying Muslim populations where the US has commercial or strategic interests.” The plan they came up with–which was called “US Strategy in the Muslim World after 9-11”– recommended that the US, “Align its policy with Shiite groups who aspire to have more participation in government and greater freedoms of political and religious expression. If this alignment can be brought about, it could erect a barrier against radical Islamic movements and may create a foundation for a stable U.S. position in the Middle East.”</p>
<p>The Bushies decided to follow this wacky plan which proved to be a huge tactical error. By throwing their weight behind the Shia, they triggered a massive Sunni rebellion that initiated as many as 100 attacks per day on US soldiers. That, in turn, led to a savage US counterinsurgency that wound up killing tens of thousands of Sunnis while reducing much of the country to ruins. Petraeus’ vicious onslaught was concealed behind the misleading PR smokescreen of sectarian civil war. It was actually a genocidal war against the people who Obama now tacitly supports in Mosul and Tikrit.</p>
<p>So there’s been a huge change of policy, right? And the fact that the US has taken a hands-off approach to Isis suggests that the Obama administration has abandoned the Rand strategy altogether and is looking for ways to support Sunni-led groups in their effort to topple the Al Assad regime in Damascus, weaken Hezbollah, and curtail Iran’s power in the region. While the strategy is ruthless and despicable, at least it makes sense in the perverted logic of imperial expansion, which the Rand plan never did.</p>
<p>What is happening in Iraq today was anticipated in a 2007 Seymour Hersh article titled “The Redirection.” Author Tony Cartalucci gives a great summary of the piece in his own article. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Redirection,” documents…US, Saudi, and Israeli intentions to create and deploy sectarian extremists region-wide to confront Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hersh would note that these “sectarian extremists” were either tied to Al Qaeda, or Al Qaeda itself. The ISIS army moving toward Baghdad is the final manifestation of this conspiracy, a standing army operating with impunity, threatening to topple the Syrian government, purge pro-Iranian forces in Iraq, and even threatening Iran itself by building a bridge from Al Qaeda’s NATO safe havens in Turkey, across northern Iraq, and up to Iran’s borders directly…</p>
<p>It is a defacto re-invasion of Iraq by Western interests – but this time without Western forces directly participating – rather a proxy force the West is desperately attempting to disavow any knowledge of or any connection to.” (<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article38793.htm">America’s Covert Re-Invasion of Iraq, Tony Cartalucci</a>, Information Clearinghouse)</p></blockquote>
<p>So, now we’re getting to the crux of the matter, right? Now we should be able to identify the policy that is guiding events. What we know for sure is that the US wants to break Iran’s grip on Iraq. But how do they plan to achieve that; that’s the question?</p>
<p>Well, they could use their old friends the Baathists who they’ve been in touch with since 2007. That might work. But then they’d have to add a few jihadis to the mix to make it look believable.</p>
<p>Okay. But does that mean that Obama is actively supporting Isis?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily. Isis is already connected to other Intel agencies and might not need direct support from the US. (Note: Many analysts have stated that the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) receives generous donations from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, both of whom are staunch US allies. According to London’s Daily Express: “through allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the West (has) supported militant rebel groups which have since mutated into ISIS and other al‑Qaeda connected militias. ( Daily Telegraph, June 12, 2014)</p>
<p>What’s important as far as Obama is concerned, is that the strategic objectives of Isis and those of the United States coincide. Both entities seek greater political representation for Sunnis, both want to minimize Iranian influence in Iraq, and both support a soft partition plan that former president of the Council on Foreign Relations, Leslie H. Gelb, called “The only viable strategy to correct (Iraq ‘s) historical defect and move in stages toward a three-state solution: Kurds in the north, Sunnis in the center and Shiites in the south.” This is why Obama hasn’t attacked the militia even though it has marched to within 50 miles of Baghdad. It’s because the US benefits from these developments.</p>
<p>Let’s summarize:</p>
<p><em>Does the US Government “support” or “not support” terrorism depending on the situation?</em><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><em>Have foreign Intel agencies supplied terrorist organizations in Syria with weapons and logistical support?</em><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><em>Has the CIA?</em><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><em>Has the Obama administration signaled that they would like to get rid of al Maliki or greatly reduce his power?</em><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><em>Is this because they think the present arrangement strengthens Iran’s regional influence?</em><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><em>Will Isis invade Baghdad?</em><br />
No. (This is just a guess, but I expect that something has been already worked out between the Obama team and the Baathist leaders. If Baghdad was really in danger, Obama would probably be acting with greater earnestness.)</p>
<p><em>Will Syria and Iraq be partitioned?</em><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><em>Is Isis a CIA creation?</em><br />
No. According to Ziad Fadel, “ISIS is the creation of the one man who played Alqaeda like a yo-yo. Bandar bin Sultan.”</p>
<p><em>Does Isis take orders from Washington or the CIA?</em><br />
Probably not, although their actions appear to coincide with US strategic objectives. (which is the point!)</p>
<p><em>Is Obama’s reluctance to launch an attack on Isis indicate that he wants to diminish Iran’s power in Iraq, redraw the map of the Middle East, and create politically powerless regions run by warlords and tribal leaders?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes and yes.</p>

<p>The Robber Barons of the 19th and 20th century had nothing over the elites of today’s globalist transnational financial conglomerates. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2014/03/03/forbes-billionaires-full-list-of-the-richest-americans/">The Richest Americans</a>, listed in Forbes conceals the real power that controls the economy. Net worth is deficient in gauging dominance in financial commercialism and monetary preeminence. The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/top-50-highest-paid-ceos-23877871">Top 50 Highest-Paid CEOs</a> as reported by ABC News ties into Michael Hiltzik’s account that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20131020-column.html/lpage=1">CEO-to-worker pay gap is obscene</a>, &#8220;The average CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 2012 was about 350 to 1.&#8221; Yet the divide in pay does not exemplify the exact lose in a livable standard of living for the ordinary staffer.If corporate multinationals were really about creating actual wealth, the pay of inspirational leadership and senior management talent, that executes the business plan, would be incidental if the employees were sharing in affluence. Those who demand higher minimum wage compensation do not understand how business works. The inordinate wealth divide, cannot and will not be reduced, until genuine economic prosperity is achieved.</p>
<p>Analyze the idiocy of a naive Undergraduate Research Fellow, Brian Chesley in <a href="http://www.mn2020hindsight.org/view/3-ways-to-reduce-the-wealth-gap">3 Ways to Reduce the Wealth Gap</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
1. Open higher education to everyone.</p>
<p>2. Increase the minimum wage.</p>
<p>3. Increase taxes on the rich.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Such ignorant and illiterate attitudes demonstrate that institutions of higher learning encourage an atmosphere of social collectivism that plays directly into the hands of the new tyrannical tycoons.</p>
<p>The New York Times OP-ED piece by Daniel Altman (an adjunct associate professor of economics at the New York University Stern School of Business and a former member of the New York Times editorial board), proposes a foolish mindset and proposal in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/opinion/to-reduce-inequality-tax-wealth-not-income.html?_r=0">To Reduce Inequality, Tax Wealth, Not Income</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In 1992, the top tenth of the population controlled 20 times the wealth controlled by the bottom half. By 2010, it was 65 times. Our graduated income-tax system redistributes a small amount of money every year but does little to slow the polarization of wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>American household wealth totaled more than $58 trillion in 2010. A flat wealth tax of just 1.5 percent on financial assets and other wealth like housing, cars and business ownership would have been more than enough to replace all the revenue of the income, estate and gift taxes, which amounted to about $833 billion after refunds. Brackets of, say, zero percent up to $500,000 in wealth, 1 percent for wealth between $500,000 and $1 million, and 2 percent for wealth above $1 million would probably have done the trick as well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Absent in redistribution of wealth schemes is that the method of authentic free enterprise is never understood. Nor is there ever an effort to reestablish the principles of real business competition. The marketplace of voluntary and mutually beneficial commercial transactions, destroyed by the systemic Corporatocracy model, is the ultimate reason why wealth disparity is so great. The literal legacy of the Robber Barons is the internationalist financial system of central banking that predetermines the outcomes of selective patrons from calculating crony capitalism.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/CorporateProfitsWagesCartoon.jpg" alt="CorporateProfitsWagesCartoon.jpg" align="right" /></p>
<p>Public companies, once established to develop, produce and sell innovative goods or services are rare in an environment where financial manipulation is the primary vehicle to riches. Equity exchanges, based upon raising capital for industrious and constructive ventures, seldom function for this utilitarian purpose. The global economy, in reality, has perfected an anti-free enterprise filter that stamps out initiative and penalties upstarts that are not part of the cartels.</p>
<p>With the insolvency of the world-banking system an inescapable fact, the prospects for even more concentration of real assets into the hands of the financial elites, posed for the final wealth confiscation, of resources not already in their hands, is upon us.</p>
<p>When the internationalist financial system implodes and business screeches to a halt, a populist movement to clawback century long fraudulent gains of the hidden stashes from the interlocked illuminati families is the only coherent alternative to establish a fiscally sound financial future.</p>
<div>Julie Lévesque writes in Global Research, <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/bilderberg-2014-war-criminals-big-oil-and-too-big-to-jail-banksters-meet-in-secrecy/5384502">Bilderberg 2014: War Criminals, Big Oil and &#8220;Too Big to Jail&#8221; Banksters Meet in Secrecy</a>. He also cites our Negotium essay, <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/081512.html">Goldman Sachs Above the Law</a>.</div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The 2014 Bilderberg meeting is another example of those &#8220;blurred lines&#8221; between government, big oil and the financial sector, the three pillars of war. According to some <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/bilderberg-agenda-revealed-elite-desperate-to-rescue-unipolar-world/5384291?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=bilderberg-agenda-revealed-elite-desperate-to-rescue-unipolar-world">reports</a>, the topics of discussion at this year’s meeting will include the situation in Ukraine and the Russia-NATO relationship, as well as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), an agreement which, <a href="http://stopttip.net/">according to Stop TTIP</a>, &#8220;is in fact a corporate coup that will take us to a ‘corporatocracy’, a corporate-run world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The mental confusion that blocks out the way the world fundamentally functions prevents focusing upon any essential debate as to substitute economic parameters for an equitable stake and remuneration for productive contributions to the success of any commercial venture.</p>
<p>The term Robber Barons, should not be substituted for every prosperous risk taker or self-made entrepreneur. The corruption within the cabal economy is rooted in the very nature of the favorable treatment given to participants in the criminal corporatist syndicate.</p>
<p>As Ms. Lévesque correctly describes the methods and operations of this New World Order neo-feudalism, the only structure that offers any prospects for an economic renaissance must target and strip the political influence of the globalists as much as the confiscation of their vast holdings.</p>
<p>Do not be deceived, by communist or socialist newspeak. Sharing the wealth is not the objective. The goal is imposing an unconditionally surrender upon the banksters, which is serious business. Start with the elimination of the <a href="http://www.batr.org/negotium/100913.html">Rehypothecation of Collateral</a>. Lawful business has no room for coexistence with derivatives and swaps.Holding the body politic accountable and committed to breaking up the banksters’ monopoly requires compliance regulatory resistance from within the business community. It is just as important as customer and buyer rejection of the corporate induced consumer society. Sadly, most people simply are uninformed about the principles of sound business.</p>
<p>Most CEO’s are not businesspersons, but are globalist enablers and often are outright thieves. The needed business revolution will not be lead by their ilk.</p>
<p>Real competition can never be encouraged until inventive and audacious risk-takers have practical alternatives to fund their enterprises. Only then, will the wealth ratio narrow as affluence, that is more tangible, expands and the fortunes of the oligarchy diminish.</p>

<p>“We regard killing on United Nations ‘peace-keeping-missions’ as ‘necessary’ and to be accepted as a fact of life.  At the same time, our murderous century views with horror God’s law.  God has no right, they hold, to require judgment.  Modern theology believes God should represent love and ‘niceness,’ never justice and judgment.  Humanistic sentiment wants evil-doers to be dealt with gently.  As a result, we have a culture which tolerates criminals, hoodlums, and exploiters of welfare who believe that they have a ‘right’ to pursue their evil ways.  Men are intolerant towards the claims of God and tolerant towards evil.”  R. J. Rushdoony, “Deuteronomy” Pg. 205</p>
<p>Ninety nine percent of the world’s population is controlled by a <a href="http://www.hangthebankers.com/the-federal-reserve-cartel/" target="_blank">small group of elite oligarchs</a> that compose less than one percent its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Tiny, high flying aircraft cover the sky with mysterious trails that expand into long, thin, vaporous clouds which are even more mysteriously ignore by the people, the media, and the government – no one seems to know who sponsors the flights, what they are spraying or why they are spraying it..  When it started, those that noticed were called “conspiracy theorists” so comments on the beginning of the spraying were quickly squelched.  Now everyone sees the mysterious chemtrails but no one challenges them.</p>
<p>The price of gasoline has followed a similar pattern.  When gas went to $3.00 a gallon there was a considerable outcry but now that it is approaching $4.00 a gallon no one is complaining.</p>
<p>When rumors of the intended overlay of the laws of the world’s nations with world government there was lots of consternation but now that it was begun in earnest during the Twenty-First Century it is quickly progressing with little resistance.</p>
<p>When President Clinton’s Administration was responsible for the deaths of over 80 innocent men, women, and children at the Koresh Compound in Waco, Texas and no one was held responsible it set the stage for what happened under the administrations of President Bush and President Obama; Executive Orders have virtually abolished the Bill of Rights setting in place the structure for a police state far worse than in Russia or Germany..</p>
<p>There was lots of publicity when President George W. Bush’s mendacity led us into war in Iraq.  But now that our armed assault in the Middle East has gone on for over ten years and amassed debt in the trillion dollar range people are disgruntled but are seemingly unaware that debt is an obligation and eventually the citizens of the United States will be forced to pay it.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of nominal, naïve Christians have spent the last several decades trying to defy the Word of God by predicting the Second Coming of Christ.  It has not happened.  A lessor number of those who acknowledged the Conspiracy have been predicting a national catastrophe for several decades. That has not happened.</p>
<p>People know that the world is being drastically changed.  They know that the governments of the individual nations are involved in ominous events that are happening on a daily basis.  They are beginning to realize that governments are part of the problem and therefore cannot become part of the solution.</p>
<p>While the closely controlled media censors the news so that nothing about the dangers to our freedom is leaked to the public the internet has innumerable speculative and prophetic articles that contain kernels of truth but are tragically surrounded by borders of speculation.</p>
<p>We know that the threat to our freedom is real but like the chemtrails we do not know who is giving the orders or when a particular event will occur.</p>
<p>There is very little that can be done about the clouds of tyranny that are falling over us.  The gun packing <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/civilian-militia-remain-bundy-ranch-standoff-ends/story?id=23394097" target="_blank">patriots that flocked to the Bundy Ranch</a> can resist the government but they are fighting against a far superior force that is fully <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/05/09/1298150/-FBI-now-investigating-Bundy-militia-threats" target="_blank">prepared to overcome</a> such resistance.</p>
<p>The American people do not vote on pernicious legislation. The men and women they elect pass these bills even though they often failed to read them.  Major legislation like NAFTA and GATT passed with unknown content.  This procedure allows the veiled authors of inimical legislation to rule the nation as invisible kings.</p>
<p>Our nation has been infused with immigrants who know little or nothing about our culture and are intent on accumulating as much money and power as possible.  Already defiled by the destruction of voter qualifications our electoral system has been destroyed by allowing the wisdom of informed, long term citizens to be destroyed by the ballot of stupid voters and recent immigrants.  The hope that participation the political process will bring us peace and freedom is futile.</p>
<p>C-Span recently hosted a consortium of female power brokers who discussed what could be done about sexual harassment in the armed services.  This group of very smart women never touched on the fact that men were created with a desire to have sex with women and women were designed to succumb.  Instead, they spent the entire house discussing how they could force men and women into close proximity and then force them to control their desires.  They never considered the fact that forcing different sexes to live together and remain chaste is like setting a building on fire and hoping is doesn’t burn.</p>
<p>Fantasy has overtaken our world.  Someone on the internet wondered if chemtrails were real!  The entire government has accepted as fact that our nation is threatened and must sacrifice freedom for safety.  They assume that the attack on the world trade center was perpetrated by Muslim enemies and ignore the sizeable block of evidence that it was a false flag.  Everyone seems to believe that Blacks and Jews are oppressed races and must be protected by sacrificing our right to free speech.  Large segments of our population support our troops and the killing and maiming of innocent people a product of U.S. imperialism.</p>
<p>“In the 21st century it is difficult to find a significant statement made by Washington that is not a lie. Obamacare is a lie. Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction is a lie. Assad’s use of chemical weapons is a lie. Iranian nukes are a lie. Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea is a lie. No fly zones are a lie. Russian aggression against Georgia is a lie. 9/11, the basis for Washington’s destruction of civil liberty and illegal military attacks, is itself a lie. The fantastic story that a few Saudi Arabians without government or intelligence agency backing outwitted the entire national security apparatus of the Western world is unbelievable. It is simply not credible that every institution of the national security state simultaneously failed. That Washington would tell such a fantastic lie shows that Washington has no respect for the intelligence of the American people and no respect for the integrity of the American media. It shows also that Washington has no respect for the intelligence and integrity of its European and Asian allies. Paul Craig Roberts, ”<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/05/paul-craigroberts/gangster-state-2/" target="_blank">Gangster State America</a>”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/06/03/ready-nuclear-war-paul-craig-roberts/" target="_blank">Read Robert’s article on the coming nuclear war</a>.</p>
<p>When serious problems are evaded they fester and create bigger problems.  Peace is jeopardized when reality is ignored.  Blacks and Whites cannot live together when bad Black behavior is ignored or erroneously blamed on Whites.  We cannot have peace when the controlled press fails to publish black crime against White citizens and allows denigration of White citizens by both Blacks and Jews; sooner or later this persistent inequity will cause problems.</p>
<p>It would be hard to find another nation that showcases the tragedy of allowing humanist government to erase immutable Law than the United States of America.  Mutable human opinion has reduced the social, legal, and governmental factions of our nation to an absurd jumble of cognitive dissonances that are impervious to order.</p>
<p>Human beings are not gods and their governments are not sovereign.  We live in a created world that is controlled by an Entity Who requires our obeisance.  We were created to live in that world and to obey that Deity, the One True God.  Confusion and tyranny are often results of our disobedience and signs of God’s judgment.  It is time the Christian Church acknowledges the fact the God is indeed still on His Throne and is the Sovereign ruler to this fast deteriorating world.</p>
<p>“It is not lonely man but all the nations that have fallen prey to original sin, to the desire to be as God (Gen. 3:5).   Each makes itself its own source of law, a clear usurpation of God’s prerogative.  Each seeks to limit or prohibit the freedom of God’s Word.  The nations without exception claim sovereignty, a plain assertion of their own lordship or deity.  Every nation is and has been a religious entity.  Moreover, the nations, as they now exist and function, are members of the fallen world of Adam and fanatic advocates of Adam’s faith and rebellion.” R. J. Rushdoony. “Systematic Theology” Vol.1, Pg. 234</p>

			<p>It is easy to stand up and cheer for your favorite government activity. It is quite another to acknowledge what it means in the real world.</p>
<p>I almost never try to speak for other people. However, I think it is fairly safe to say that the average military recruit firmly believes that he joins the military so that you and I can live and breathe in freedom. To be sure, he had other reasons for joining, but I think the defense of liberty is a fairly common characteristic.</p>
<p>That is certainly what I thought when I was in Navy boot camp in Orlando, Florida, in 1983. After all, this is what I had been told all my life: sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines defend freedom.</p>
<p>But is this actually what they do?</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Marine lost both legs in an IED blast in Iraq. He claims he was forced by TSA to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/mar/19/tsa-agents-humiliated-wounded-marine-aggressive-in/" target="_blank">remove both prosthetic legs</a> before he could board an airplane in Phoenix.</li>
<li>This Vietnam veteran in Spicewood, Texas, had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/08/raids-of-the-day-the-capi_n_2644894.html" target="_blank">flashbacks to his combat experience during a marijuana raid</a> at a friend’s house. What police claimed was marijuana turned out to be ragweed.<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg?w=300&amp;h=152" alt="jared goering" width="300" height="152" /></a></li>
<li>Jared Goering, who served 19 years in the Army, including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was <a href="http://www.lifewithdogs.tv/2013/08/veteran-kicked-off-boardwalk-for-having-a-service-dog/" target="_blank">kicked off the boardwalk in Wildwood, N.J.</a> for walking with his service dog, Gator.</li>
<li>Emily Yates, who served two tours with the Army in Iraq, was <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=3bf_1378009165" target="_blank">violently arrested by park police in Philadelphia</a> for asking why she couldn’t play her banjo under some shade trees.</li>
<li>Dimitrios Karras is a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan. Read about the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/ares-armor-operating-store-camera-caught-first-moments-of-saturday-raid" target="_blank">ATF raid on his business</a> in National City, California.</li>
<li>Martin Goldberg of Brooklyn is a World War II veteran <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/raid-of-t_n_3102929.html" target="_blank">whose apartment was subject to a drug raid</a>. Later, the cops realized they had raided the wrong apartment. His 83-year-old wife was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat as a result of the raid.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/norfolk-41.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/norfolk-41.jpg?w=640" alt="norfolk 4" /></a></li>
<li>In 1997, four sailors from the USS Saipan (LHA-2) were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19Norfolk-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">falsely accused</a> of the rape and murder of a Norfolk, Virginia, woman. One spent eight-and-one-half years in prison while the other three were sentenced to life in prison. These three were pardoned in 2009. Even though the actual killer is serving a life sentence, four innocent men are still required to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Four" target="_blank">register as sex offenders</a> and are still <a href="http://www.norfolkfour.com/" target="_blank">fighting to clear their names</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/charles.loeks/posts/584864751544987?comment_id=6139516&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=4&amp;notif_t=feed_comment_reply" target="_blank">Charles Loeks</a> was 18 and fresh out of Marine boot camp. On a trip home to Covina, California, he was hanging out with a few friends when he was arrested for resisting arrest and nothing else. He spent 21 days in Los Angeles County jail, even though he had harmed no one.</li>
<li><a href="http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2014/04/22/north-carolina-deputy-snatches-two-phones-fails-snatch-third-handcuffs-man-reason/" target="_blank">Carlos Jaramillo</a> is a former Marine combat instructor who lives in Onslow County, North Carolina. Watch what happened when he recorded a sheriff’s deputy who arrested him for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>Noel Polanco was an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/nyregion/funeral-for-noel-polanco-unarmed-man-killed-by-police.html" target="_blank">unarmed 22-year-old National Guardsman</a> who was shot and killed by New York City police at a traffic stop near LaGuardia Airport.</li>
<li>John Laigaie, a retired Army master sergeant, was <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/bellingham-man-wins-15000-settlement-after-city-co/nZPdj/" target="_blank">threatened at gunpoint</a> by police while legally carrying a gun in a park in Bellingham, Washington.</li>
<li>Homer Wright is an 80-year-old Army veteran who was <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/80-year-old-homeowner-arrested-for-shooting-burglar.html" target="_blank">charged with felony gun use</a> after he shot a burglar who entered his home in Englewood, Illinois.<br />

<li>Mark Schmidter, a Vietnam veteran who lives in Orlando, is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeAreMarkSchmidter/info" target="_blank">currently serving 145 days in a cage</a> for passing out <a href="http://fija.org/" target="_blank">jurors’ rights</a> information on the steps of a local courthouse.</li>
<li>Justin Ross of Ankeny, Iowa, was recently discharged from the Army. <a href="http://whotv.com/2014/02/03/raid-filmed-ankeny-police-traumatize-family/" target="_blank">Police used a battering ram</a> to enter his home executing a warrant for some items purchased with stolen credit cards. They did not find any of these items.</li>
<li>Saadiq Long is an Air Force veteran who was placed on a TSA no-fly list. He had to <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/US-Air-Force-Veteran-Fina-by-Glenn-Greenwald-130210-789.html" target="_blank">battle for months</a> to be removed from this list just so he could fly home from Qatar to visit his ailing mother.</li>
<li>Chuck Benton of Long Grove, Iowa, served 22 years in the Army. He was <a href="http://rare.us/story/im-a-christian-and-i-want-to-end-the-drug-war/" target="_blank">arrested and charged</a> simply for living in the same house with his son who was <a href="http://qctimes.com/news/local/medical-marijuana-heads-for-trial-in-iowa/article_3f94aa61-1fe8-5462-b2bf-4d5b598824e4.html" target="_blank">growing medical marijuana</a>.</li>
<li>Cody Donovan is a former Marine MP who lives in New Milford, N.J. He was <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/newmilford/New_Milford_man_allegedly_carried_loaded_gun_to_Garden_State_Plaza_during_shooting.html?mobile=1&amp;ic=1&amp;iphone=1" target="_blank">charged with unlawful possession of a weapon</a> after carrying a loaded gun into the Garden State Plaza mall when he attempted to help police apprehend the shooter.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bonus-march2.gif"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bonus-march2.gif?w=300&amp;h=226" alt="bonus march" width="300" height="226" /></a></li>
<li>In 1932, 17,000 veterans marched on Washington to demand payment of bonuses they had been promised as a result of their service in World War I.

<li>Radio talk host Adam Kokesh won the Navy Commendation Medal as a Marine in Iraq. In recent years, he has been <a href="http://libertycrier.com/avtm-4-0-crowdfunder-campaign/?utm_source=The+Liberty+Crier&amp;utm_campaign=00062d8203-The_Liberty_Crier_Daily_News_2_5_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_600843dec4-00062d8203-284780633" target="_blank">arrested several times for various non-violent protests</a>. His most recent arrest happened after he loaded a shotgun in public in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 2013. On July 10, police <a href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/2013/07/12/thoughts-on-the-police-raid-on-adam-kokesh-and-on-his-canceled-march/" target="_blank">violently raided his home and arrested him</a>.

He is currently on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh" target="_blank">probation for two years</a>. You may not like Kokesh’s demeanor or approve of all of his antics, but he has been very courageous when so many of his critics can’t be bothered to put down the remote.<br />

<li>James Moore, my brothah from anothah mothah, walked away from a very lucrative engineering position in San Jose to re-enlist in the Army following 9/11. He sustained significant physical injuries as well as PTSD while serving in the Special Forces in Afghanistan. On the afternoon of March 25, 2008, Moore, who had done absolutely nothing wrong, was <a href="http://www.freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/necessary-force.html">beaten to the point of flat lining by Denver police.</a></li>
<li>One of the coolest people I have never met is Antonio Buehler. Buehler graduated from West Point in 1999, earned his Ranger tab, and saw action in Kosovo and Iraq. (He also sports a Stanford MBA.) Early in the morning on January 1, 2012, Buehler <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVZDpGCKks" target="_blank">was arrested</a> for taking a few pictures of Austin police manhandling a young woman outside a 7-11. Buehler has been arrested four times since. He heads the <a href="http://peacefulstreets.com/" target="_blank">Peaceful Streets Project</a>, whose members work to expose abuse, brutality and overreach both in Austin and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FreeAntonioBuehler/" target="_blank">across the nation</a>.<br />

</ul>
<p>There are no doubt numerous other injustices against veterans that I do not know about. Enough to fill a book. None of these things would have happened if America were a free society. As Kokesh puts it, “The greatest enemies to the Constitution are not to be found in the sands of some far off land but rather right here at home.”</p>
<p>I cannot speak to the specific political beliefs of most of the veterans I have mentioned here. Some may be pacifists, while others may make John McCain look like a hippie in Haight-Ashbury. No matter what their individual views may be, the freedom they risked their lives for was flagrantly violated on the streets of the land they fought to protect.</p>

<p>Society endlessly applauds sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines for “fighting for our freedom”. It is in no way disrespectful to say that this is not what they do. No foreign government or terrorist group poses any threat to our liberty. America accounts for about half of the world’s military spending. We have 300 ships in our Navy, plus thousands of planes, tanks and nuclear warheads as well as 300 million firearms in private hands. Nobody is going to invade us.</p>
<p>In a constitutional country, which America ceased to be 100 years ago, the job of the military – a vital and most noble one – is to defend the borders, shores and airspace. It cannot protect you from being tyrannized domestically. Indeed, throughout history, armies have been instruments of domestic tyranny. Our Constitution forbids a standing army for just this reason.</p>

<p>Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia had enormous military establishments. How did things work out in these countries?</p>
<p>I am a Christian who believes liberty is a gift from God – Leviticus 25:10; II Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:1. To quote Jefferson, liberty is preserved not by military might, but by “eternal vigilance” against one’s own government at all levels. It is the grossest form of disrespect to send young men around the world to “fight for freedom” while relinquishing that freedom on the home front.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif?w=586" alt="soldier letter cartoon" /></a>For several years, America has had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate" target="_blank">world’s highest incarceration rate</a>. Since 2001, Americans have gladly accepted previously unthinkable intrusions on their freedom in the name of “safety” and “security”. These include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig6/napolitano2.html" target="_blank">warrantless searches and spying</a>, the <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hornberger/hornberger130.html" target="_blank">suspension of habeas corpus</a>, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2011/07/14/tsa-does-not-protect-you-period/" target="_blank">sexual assault as a condition of travel</a>, rampant <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/350955711587953/" target="_blank">police brutality</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/" target="_blank">indefinite detention</a> without any semblance of due process, severe <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2012/05/02/were-almost-there-now/" target="_blank">restrictions on peaceful protest</a>, massive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/03/11/1-6-billion-rounds-of-ammo-for-homeland-security-its-time-for-a-national-conversation/" target="_blank">ammunition purchases by DHS</a> and <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/the_empire_strikes_back_attack_of_the_drones" target="_blank">surveillance drones in our skies</a> watching our every move. Can <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2011/07/imperial-priorities-obedience-first.html" target="_blank">predator drones</a> be far behind?</p>
<p>And in every election 98 percent of voters put their stamp of approval on perpetuating this monstrosity.</p>

<p>On April 20, 2013, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/20/but-they-got-the-suspect-thats-not-the-point/" target="_blank">Boston and several surrounding towns</a> got a <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/25/lockdowns-do-not-keep-you-safe-letter-to-the-denver-post/" target="_blank">serious taste</a> of <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/23/sometimes-martial-law-is-necessary/" target="_blank">martial law</a>. How many military veterans were on the receiving end of this? Is this what they signed up to fight for?</p>
<p>Stop thinking in clichés. Have a good hard look at everything your media and government tell you. This includes media outlets and parts of the government that you like. Study. Read. Ask questions. And learn that the defense of liberty is not the duty of the military. Rather, it is your duty and mine.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just want to pimp slap people.</p>
<p>Last summer, I was at dinner during a sales convention. The conversation didn’t get political until someone mentioned the NSA.</p>
<p>There is one in every crowd. Someone piped up and said, “They can spy on me all they want. I am not doing anything wrong.”</p>
<p>They sang this song in Germany in 1933. And they sang it with unprecedented gusto in the months following 9/11, all in the name of  “security” and “keeping us safe”.</p>
<p>We were at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, the world’s second largest hotel. Nothing in the post-9/11 “national security” apparatus would prevent a terrorist from walking in, setting off a bomb, and killing hundreds or even thousands of people.</p>
<p>The more important questions are: How do you know you are doing nothing that could be construed as wrong by some state functionary? How do you know you are not breaking some law somewhere? And why are you so implicitly trusting that your government would never do anything evil with the information it has collected on you?</p>
<p>This is not purely an academic matter. The practical implications are profound.</p>
<p>I give you several examples.</p>
<p>1. Niakea Williams went to her son’s St. Louis-area elementary school one day to pick up her son, who has Asperger’s. The school was put on lockdown and <a href="http://www.kmov.com/news/local/Mother-arrested-at-school-for-consoling-son-in-local-classroom-251349481.html">Mrs. Williams was escorted out in handcuffs.</a></p>
<p>2. Adrionna Harris was <a href="http://wavy.com/2014/03/19/student-suspended-for-taking-razor-from-self-harming-classmate/">almost expelled from her middle school</a> in Virginia Beach after taking a razor blade away from a fellow student who was trying to harm himself.</p>
<p>3. Read what <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/17/houston-police-just-assume-guy-giving-ch">Houston police did</a> to this man who gave 75 cents to a homeless person.</p>
<p>4. A little known Denver parking ordinance can get you a $25 fine <a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/little-known-parking-ordinance-could-get-you-25-ticket-even-if-you-havent-exceeded-time-limits">even if you haven’t exceeded the two-hour limit.</a></p>
<p>5. Police in Iowa City, Iowa, <a href="http://ij.org/iowa-cops-seize-almost-50-000-from-a-couple-didn-t-charge-them-with-a-crime">seized $50,000</a> from this couple without charging them with a crime.</p>
<p>6. Alberto Willmore lost his teaching job in Manhattan over a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEzZSDKOVM4#t=321">totally bogus marijuana arrest.</a> Even though he was never convicted of anything, he was unable to get his job back.</p>
<p>7. Norman Gurley was arrested in Lorain County, Ohio, because a compartment in his car <a href="http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/2013/11/20/trap-car-law/3655713/">could have been used to transport drugs.</a></p>
<p>8. Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies <a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2014/02/115178-police-shoot-kill-80-year-old-man-bed/">shot and killed 80-year-old Eugene Mallory</a> in his own bed during a meth raid. No meth, or any other illegal drugs, was discovered.</p>
<p>9. Paul Valin contacted police to report that he found a backpack full of what he believed to be meth-making equipment 15 miles from his home near Des Moines. As a result, the DEA placed his house <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/28/mans-good-deed-lands-his-home-on-dea-list-meth-labs/?intcmp=latestnews">on its list of meth labs.</a></p>
<p>10. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Holle">Ryan Holle</a> of Pensacola, Florida, lent his roommate his car on night in 2004. As a result, Holle is currently serving a <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/lending-friend-your-car-can-get-you-life-sentence?page=0%2C0&amp;paging=off&amp;current_page=1#bookmark">life sentence without possibility of parole</a> for pre-meditated murder.</p>
<p>11. New York police seized Gerald Bryan’s cash in a nighttime raid in 2012. <a href="http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/nypd-seized-innocent-mans-cash-used-pad-pensions/#axzz2qOoePUCS">Even though Bryan was cleared of any wrongdoing</a>, the stolen cash was deposited in the NYPD pension fund.</p>
<p>12. Robert Duncan is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/03/robert-duncan-marijuana_n_4877072.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592">currently serving two years in a California prison</a>, even though the business in which he worked was legal in California.</p>
<p>13. Jordan Wiser spent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/jordan-wiser_n_4921266.html?utm_hp_ref=crime">13 days in jail</a> after Jefferson, Ohio, police found a pocketknife during a warrantless search of his car.</p>
<p>14. During a school lockdown in Clarksville, Tennessee, David Duren-Sanner gave police permission to search his car as he had “nothing to hide”. Police found a fishing knife. Duren-Sanner, who previously had never been to the principal’s office, <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/story/24811452/clarksville-student-suspended-for-knife-in-fathers-car">was suspended for 10 days and then sent to an alternative school for 90 days.</a></p>
<p>15. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/12/health/medical-marijuana-parents/index.html?hpt=hp_t3">Look what happened</a> to these parents in Napa, California, even though the medical marijuana prescriptions they had were completely legal.</p>
<p>16. Eileen Ann Bower of suburban Pittsburgh <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/03/17/county-settles-with-mother-who-lost-newborn-after-erroneous-drug-test/">had her newborn child taken from her for 75 days</a> because of a false positive drug test.</p>
<p>17. Jerry Hartfield of Bay City, Texas, has spent the majority of his life in prison, even though his<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-inmate-conviction-overturned-1980-behind-bars-article-1.1761084#ixzz2zY4CTny7">conviction was overturned in 1980</a>.</p>
<p>18. Jason Dewing of update New York was <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/exclusive-man-found-guilty-of-electronic-cigarette-law-that-does-not-exist">found guilty of violating a law that did not exist.</a></p>
<p>19. Don Miller of Waldron, Indiana, had his home <a href="http://advanceindiana.blogspot.com/2014/04/seriously-fbi-devoted-massive-resources.html">raided by FBI agents</a> who seized hundreds of cultural artifacts from around the world. Miller was neither arrested nor charged with anything.</p>
<p>20. This San Diego couple was <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/cop-types-wrong-license-plate-number-nightmare-innocent-couple/">pepper-sprayed and tasered</a> by police who had erroneously identified their vehicle after being stolen.</p>
<p>21. The good news is that Brian Aitken of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/brian-aitken-jersey-gun-charge-commuted-gov-chris/story?id=12448867">had his prison sentence commuted.</a>The bad news is that he was originally sentenced to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/14/Possessing-Legally-Purchased-Guns-In-New-Jersey-Cost-Brian-Aitken-Everything">seven years behind bars</a> for possessing two legally purchased guns.</p>
<p>22. This special needs student in McDonald, Pennsylvania, was <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1209361/disabled-boy-records-bullies-tormenting-him-police-charge-him-with-illegal-wiretapping/">charged with felony wiretapping</a> for recording other students who were bullying him mercilessly.</p>

<p>24. Read what happened to John Filippidis of Hudson, Florida, when he was <a href="http://tbo.com/list/columns-tjackson/jackson-gun-owner-unarmed-unwelcome-in-maryland-20140112/">pulled over by state police</a>while driving unarmed through Maryland.</p>
<p>25. In a case of mistaken identity, Lewis James of Durham, North Carolina, <a href="http://www.wral.com/nccu-sophomore-mistakenly-jailed-for-doing-the-right-thing-/13431855/">“was handcuffed and later jailed under a $1.425 million bond”</a> after he had contacted the police to notify them of a dead body in the middle of the road. As someone put it on Facebook, “Don’t call the cops. Ever. Even if you find a dead body. Just don’t ever call the cops.”</p>
<p>26. Read what happened to Diane Avera of Meridian, Mississippi, when she went to Alabama to buy Sudafed, <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/predators-of-marengo-county.html">even though she did not know</a> that this was illegal.</p>
<p>27. Andy Johnson of Uinta County, Wyoming, faces <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/man-vs-epa-uinta-county-man-faces-k-in-daily/article_f7312717-3d3c-555b-8c15-fc48fbfe0073.html">EPA fines of $75,000 per day</a> for building a pond on land that he owns.</p>
<p>28. Douglas Zerby of Long Beach was <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-shoot-kill-man-watering-lawn-family-awarded-6-5-million/">shot and killed by police</a> while watering his lawn because some idiot neighbor thought the hose nozzle was a gun.</p>
<p>29. Darien Roseen was <a href="http://seattle.cbslocal.com/2014/03/28/lawsuit-man-arrested-searched-for-marijuana-solely-for-having-colorado-license-plate/">arrested and had his vehicle searched</a> by sheriff’s deputies in Payette County, Idaho, simply because his Colorado license plates led them to believe that he could have been carrying marijuana.</p>
<p>30. Brian Banks of Long Beach <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/7986979/redemption-brian-banks">spent five years in prison and five more years as a registered sex offender</a>as a result of a rape conviction. And then his accuser changed her story.</p>
<p>These are not “isolated incidents.” There are no doubt countless other examples of people who were doing nothing wrong, yet were harshly punished.</p>
<p>Also, consider the following:</p>
<p>• The Internal Revenue Code is <a href="http://www.cch.com/wbot2013/factsheet.pdf">73,955 pages</a> and millions of words long. No one has read it cover-to-cover and no one knows every aspect of it. Yet if anyone violates any of its provisions it can mean fines, prison or even death.</p>
<p>• We are often told that “ignorance of the law is no defense.” To the right is a picture of the Yale Law Library. Do you know every law contained within these tomes?</p>

<p>• Seventy-two types of Americans are <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/08/72-types-of-americans-that-are.html">classified as terrorists</a> in various government documents.

<p><em>&#8220;The grimmest dictatorship is the dictatorship of the prevailing orthodoxy&#8221; - </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/02/international/europe/02galloway.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=a3295fe213e5261f&amp;ex=1277956800&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">George Galloway</a></p>
<p>In a relativism culture of social permissiveness, the non-judgmental attitude, held out as the suitable standard for conduct, has become the politically correct behavior. One might think that anything goes under this mindset. However, the exact opposite practice and enforcement, under the most rigid conditions, is championed as necessary for enlighten and tolerant liberalists. The proliferation of demands that hate speech is the new capital crime, actually is counter iterative in building a civil society. This orthodoxy of the fanatical, proudly presents this illuminated and required deportment, as obligatory for all citizens.</p>
<p>So what exactly is hate for the neo-Jacobins? Obviously, whatever the &#8220;<em>Society of the Friends of the LIVING Constitution</em>&#8221; deems it to be, because under the color of law, the self-proclaimed pure of heart, are justified to off the heads of anyone who dares speak out in inappropriate terms. Remember &#8220;thinking progress&#8221; for the greater good, must be imposed on anyone who dare defies the wisdom of the gatekeepers for the collective.</p>
<p>Racism has to go, unless practiced by Negros against whites, or is the mere mention of such a term a slight to African-Americans? Once upon a time cries of anti-Semitism would be heard if <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/la-naacp-head-resigns-move-honor-sterling-23556060">Donald Sterling</a> was made a pariah after the NAACP did an about face after awarding him for promoting civil rights. Not in today’s world, such a distasteful zealot no longer has the protection of his tribe from the scrutiny of the thought police. The almost total condemnation of his recently private remarks has the entire sports world clambering for his forced sale of the LA Clippers.</p>

<p>Such broad-minded fans in a league that made homies multimillionaires and took them out of the hood, must not be dis. No wonder the attraction of not just the NBA, but sports in general, have serious minded buffs of the Wide World of Sports looking for, &#8220;<em>The Thrill of Victory&#8230;</em>&#8221; in other arenas. Why not demonstrate that sporting enthusiasm and jock celebrity worship, by starting a grassroots campaign to install America’s favorite redneck, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/conservatives-defend-duck-dynasty-star-phil-robertsons-anti-gay-remarks-1516160">Phil Robertson</a> and his Duck Dynasty clan, as the new ownership of the team.Surely, good standing Democrats should have no problem supporting a bunch of good old boys from the South. Frances Rice writes in the National Black Republicans Association site that, <a href="http://www.nationalblackrepublicans.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=pages.DYKKKKTerroristArmoftheDemocratParty">KKK Terrorist Arm of the Democratic Party</a>. &#8220;This ugly fact about the Democrat Party is detailed in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Reconstruction-Eric-Foner/dp/0060964316">A Short History of Reconstruction</a>, (Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc., 1990) by Dr. Eric Foner, the renowned liberal historian who is the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. Dr. Foner in his book explores the history of the origins of Ku Klux Klan and provides a chilling account of the atrocities committed by Democrats against Republicans, black and white.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democratic-party-cre/">Carole Emberton</a>, an associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today. Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/3/eric-holders-liberal-racism/" target="_self"><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/holderracist.jpg" alt="holderracist.jpg" align="Left" /></a><br />
Fast forward to today’s conductor <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/eric_holder_hate_crimes_and_his_people.html">Eric Holder</a>, of selective bigoted <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/032414.html">racism</a>, when describing &#8220;his people&#8221;, who &#8220;seem to get a pass on hate crime charges when they select whites for their blood sport&#8221;, one needs to question who the real haters are. David Risselada provides a valid assessment in the essay, <a href="http://patriotupdate.com/articles/hate-crimes-legislation-racial-identity-politics-institutional-racism-left/">Hate Crimes Legislation . . . Racial Identity Politics and the Institutional Racism of the Left</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The institutional racism that is built in our society is the responsibility of the left. Throughout history it has been the democrats who have supported segregation and slavery while continuously voting against civil rights legislation. Today, they attempt to hide their history through racial identity politics, and the creation of a system where inequality is the new equality. By creating laws based on racial preferences, the left is telling minorities that they believe they are not as capable as white men and therefore need their programs in order to stand a chance in the racist United States of America. This does little but reinforce hatred while attempting to justify black on white violence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time and in a place long ago, the Democratic Party defended the rights of the individual to associate with individuals of their choosing and speak their minds openly and without concern of censor. Since the conversion to ecumenical orthodoxy, the authoritarians that gave you the New Deal and the Great Society have a long record of creating their own hatred of Free Speech. The example of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?hp">New York Times</a> vicious attack on <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2014/04/24/cliven-bundy-controversial-remarks-full-context-video-with-transcript/">Cliven Bundy</a> illustrates another trumped-up incident ripe to exploit.The New American, author William F. Jasper makes the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Much of what Mr. Bundy is saying closely parallels what even many black leaders, authors and intellectuals — such as Prof. Walter Williams, Rev. C.L. Bryant, Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, Bill Cosby, Alveda King, Star Parker, and Alan Keyes — have been saying. But Cliven Bundy’s &#8220;sin&#8221; is that he is an elderly white man who is unschooled in traversing the minefield of political correctness — and he was careless in failing to make important distinctions and clarifications. He &#8220;sinned&#8221; by being born when he was born, and failing to keep up with the constantly changing terminology for ethnic designations. He still uses the terms &#8220;Negro,&#8221; &#8220;colored people,&#8221; and &#8220;Mexican,&#8221; instead of &#8220;black/ African American&#8221; or &#8220;Hispanic/Latino&#8221; — but then, race activists still argue amongst themselves concerning the &#8220;proper&#8221; ethnic label to apply to their lineage and group identity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When Senator <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/goodbye-free-speech-mass-dem-wants-government-to-monitor-speech-for-hate">Ed Markey</a>, D-Mass., introduces legislation called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2014-04-08_HateCrimes_Legislation1.pdf">Hate Crime Reporting Act of 2014</a>,&#8221; it is another partisan concerted attempt to silence voices and views entirely protected under the First Amendment, by monitoring radio, television and Internet speech. Can one say arbitrary and capricious, or will Big Brother now prey on any convenient and moving target to label anyone as a hate monger, that does not conform to the &#8220;PC&#8221; orthodoxy?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fTn6skhq-08" width="480" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The excellent video from Ben Swann identifies in <a href="http://youtu.be/fTn6skhq-08">New &#8220;Hate Crime&#8221; Bill Will Attempt To Control Speech On Internet, Radio and TV</a>, that the real objective is to censor the internet.</p>
<p>Well, this development should concern any student of inquiry, but the real world often fosters political threats that seem to be so implausible, if they were not true. The case of the arrest of <a href="http://vdare.com/posts/britain-quoting-winston-churchill-about-islam-is-now-an-arrestable-offense">Paul Weston</a> should alarm everyone. In the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/michael-coren-interviews-paul-weston-concerning-his-free-speech-arrest">Michael Coren interview or Mr. Weston</a>, the vanguard of British lunacy once again blazes new trails in the annals of hate speech. If quoting Winston Churchill is now a crime, what does that make Winnie?The British Bulldog is his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property — either as a child, a wife, or a concubine — must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Move over denial ridden Americans; the English have a talent in leading the civilized world in false guilt. For the rest of humankind, they are perceptive enough to admit that the normal human condition acknowledges <a href="http://batr.org/view_/060501.html">Discrimination as a Virtue</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Discrimination has been characterized as racism. Quite to the contrary, discrimination is an ally in the struggle to end bigotry and injustice. When Liberty is suppressed in a quest for equality; hatred and revulsion breeds, for different groups, cultures and ideologies. All attempts to force equal treatment are futile, even when severe penalties are imposed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Condemning a person, solely by his beliefs, bias and predisposition – that fanatical frenzy will surely bring about the fall of our cherished tradition of Free Speech. For those who fear Sharia Law, you had better be more concerned about the progressive despots, who are the model for imposed intolerance through a government, which hates everyone that refuses their Groupthink.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The crimes of the United States have been systematic, constant, vicious, remorseless, but very few people have actually talked about them. You have to hand it to America. It has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good.” - <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article11239.htm">Harold Pinter, Nobel Acceptance Speech</a></p>
<p>“Obama is just a willing executioner. From the ruling class’s point of view, he’s the perfect figurehead because his mere appearance confuses and disarms so many. He seems to have spent his whole life trying to get chosen to play Judas. And that’s all there is in his resume.” -bevin, Comments line, Moon of Alabama</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a newly-released <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304250204579433533118580224?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll</a>, Barack Obama’s job-approval ratings have dipped to a new low of 41 percent with a full 54 percent of respondents saying they “disapproved” of the job he’s doing. Obama’s handling of the economy, health care and foreign policy were particular areas of concern for most respondents. On health care, Obama is seen as having strengthened the for-profit insurance industry with little benefit for ordinary working people. The survey also showed “the lowest-ever approval” for the president’s handling of foreign policy. And, on the economy, the results were even more shocking; a full 57% of the people polled “believe the U.S. is still in a recession” while “65 percent think the country is on the wrong track”. Widespread disappointment in Obama’s performance has weakened his support among blacks, Hispanics and women, traditionally, the most loyal groups in the Party’s base.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that Obama has been hurt by the anemic recovery or by focusing on deficit reduction instead of job creation. High unemployment, flat wages and shrinking incomes have weighed heavily on expectations, which has put a damper on consumption and growth. Gallup’s Economic Confidence index now shows a “sharp decline in the outlook for the future” …”with some 57 percent of the respondents saying things are getting worse, not better.”</p>
<p>Indeed, things have gotten worse under Obama, much worse, which is why many of his most ardent supporters are falling off the bandwagon. And the disappointment is not limited to economic policy either. Recent surveys confirm what most people already know, that the public is tired of the interventions, the provocations, the meddling and the endless wars. The American people are increasingly isolationist and want the government to disengage from foreign conflicts. Here’s an excerpt from a recent survey by PEW that sums up the mood of the country:</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the first time since 1964, more than half (52%) agree that the U.S. should “mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own;” 38% disagree, according to a survey conducted Oct.-Nov. 2013. Similarly, 80% agree with the statement, “We should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems and building up our strength and prosperity here at home.” (<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/key-data-points/u-s-foreign-policy-key-data-points/" target="_blank">U.S. Foreign Policy: Key Data Points from Pew Research</a>, PEW Research Center)</p></blockquote>
<p>The PEW poll merely expands on the findings in other surveys like this from the LA Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Two thirds of Americans questioned in a recent poll said the 12-year war fought in Afghanistan…hasn’t been worth the price paid in lives and dollars…</p>
<p>The survey conducted for the media by Langer Research Associates of New York found that disillusionment with the U.S.-led war was expressed by a majority of all political leanings. Overall, 66% of respondents said the war hasn’t been worth it. Those who identified themselves as liberals were most unhappy with the military investment: 78% said the war was a mistake.” (<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/20/world/la-fg-wn-afghanistan-war-support-poll-20131220" target="_blank">Poll: Two thirds of Americans say Afghan war not worth fighting</a>, LA Times)</p></blockquote>
<p>The same is true of Iraq. The war wasn’t worth fighting. Check this out on ABC News:</p>
<p>“Ten years after U.S. airstrikes on Baghdad punctuated the start of the Iraq war, nearly six in 10 Americans say the war was not worth fighting – a judgment shared by majorities steadily since initial success gave way to years of continued conflict.</p>
<p>Nearly as many in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll say the same about the war in Afghanistan. And while criticisms of both wars are down from their peaks, the intensity of sentiment remains high, with strong critics far outweighing strong supporters.” (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/03/a-decade-on-most-are-critical-of-the-u-s-led-war-in-iraq/" target="_blank">A Decade on, Most are Critical of the U.S.-Led War in Iraq</a>, ABC News)</p>
<p>And that brings us to today and the looming prospect of a war with Russia over developments in the Crimea. Here’s what people are thinking according to a survey in the Washington Post:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A new poll suggests Americans have very little appetite for any real involvement in the crisis in Ukraine. Only 29 percent of Americans would like for the Obama administration to take a ‘firm stand’ against Russia’s incursion into its neighbor, according to the Pew Research Center poll, while nearly twice as many — 56 percent — prefer the United States not to get too involved in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The poll reflects a war-weary American public that is still very reticent to get involved in international conflicts. The American people were similarly opposed to military intervention in Syria last year, despite President Obama calling for the use of force and seeking congressional approval for action.” (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/03/11/few-americans-want-firm-stand-against-russia-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">Few Americans want ‘firm stand’ against Russia in Ukraine</a>, Washington Post)</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Obama doesn’t care the American people want. He’s going to do what he signed-on to do; crack down on civil liberties, strangle the economy, and spread war across the planet. As far as the warmongering goes–he’s doing an even better job than Bush. Don’t believe me? Just check out this clip from the International Business Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In their annual End of Year poll, researchers for WIN and Gallup International surveyed more than 66,000 people across 65 nations and found that 24 percent of all respondents answered that the United States “is the greatest threat to peace in the world today.” Pakistan and China fell significantly behind the United States on the poll, with 8 and 6 percent, respectively.” (<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/gallup-poll-biggest-threat-world-peace-america-1525008" target="_blank">In Gallup Poll, The Biggest Threat To World Peace Is… America?</a>, IBT)</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it, the Obama presidency in a nutshell: “The United States is the greatest threat to peace in the world today.” Keep in mind, this survey wasn’t taken during the Bush years. Oh no. This is all Obama’s doing, every bit of it.</p>
<p>Let’s summarize: The majority of Americans think Obama is doing a lousy job. They think the economy stinks, and they think their financial situation is getting worse. They also think the country is on the wrong track, that America is a threat to world peace, and that they don’t want anymore goddamned wars.</p>
<p>Check, check, check, check and check.</p>
<p>So, what do you think the Obama administration’s reaction to this public outpouring has been?</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what it’s been. They’re happy. That’s right, they’re happy. Despite the plunging poll numbers and dwindling public support, the Obama team feels vindicated by the fact that they’re not as widely reviled as the Bush administration. That’s their benchmark: Bush. And they could be on to something too, after all, who would have thought that a president could repeal habeas corpus, destroy the economy, launch wars and coups like they’re going out of style, vaporize hundreds of innocent people in drone attacks, intensify surveillance on every man, woman and child in the United States, and claim the right to assassinate US citizens without due process, without inciting millions of enraged Americans to grab their pitchforks and head to Washington?</p>
<p>That’s what would have happened if Bush was still in office, right? But Obama gets a “pass”. Why? Because he’s an articulate, charismatic black man who the vast majority of Dems still admire. Can you believe it?</p>
<p>Obama represents everything these people profess to hate–war, drone attacks, Gitmo, austerity, Wall Street (no prosecutions), indefinite detention, executive privilege (to assassinate) etc–and yet they still put the man on a pedestal. Which is why we think that Obama is the greatest public relations invention of all-time; a beaming, exuberant, galvanic paragon who embodies all the laudatory characteristics of leadership and who–at the same time– is able to carry out the most despicable, inhuman acts without the slightest hesitation or remorse. He is man who feels nothing towards his fellow human beings, neither empathy, compassion, or mercy. What matters to Obama is that he faithfully follow the script that’s been written for him by his miscreant handlers, that odious amalgam of cutthroat corporatists, bank mandarins and loafing ivy league silver-spooners who make up America’s iniquitous Kleptocracy. The best description of Obama I’ve ever read was in the comments section of a foreign policy blogsite called Moon of Alabama by a blogger named “bevin”. Here’s what he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think that Obama is completely empty of scruples…just a willing executioner. From the ruling class’s point of view he is the perfect figurehead because his mere appearance confuses and disarms so many. He seems to have spent his whole life trying to get chosen to play Judas. And that is all there is in his resume…</p>
<p>They present him as negligent, never responsible, never intentionally connected to an evil act, never drawn into the acts of duplicity by a conscious intent. This is the false image, the disinformation projected about who he is…</p>
<p>It strikes me that Obama is all those things. And that this is the core of the evil in him- that he is without conscience or principle, just an ordinary butcher going about his business, fulfilling the terms of his employment, doing what he was asked to do…</p>
<p>You see him as focused and intentional.</p>
<p>I see him as someone who will sign a stack of death warrants without reading them, or thinking about them again. Remember just after November 2008, waiting to take office, how the Israelis attacked Gaza, obviously to show him who is boss? Didn’t you sense that even they were surprised at the insouciance with which he watched those extraordinary massacres pass before his eyes?</p>
<p>He didn’t care. And he was, at last, relieved of the chore of pretending that he did care about such things.</p>
<p>That’s really what he likes about being President: he can relax while the killing goes on, he doesn’t need to pretend it bothers him, he doesn’t need to pass any kind of moral judgment.</p>
<p>Remember when he asked his step-father “Have you ever killed men?”</p>
<p>The reply he got was “Only men who were weak.”</p>
<p>He has adhered to that moral standard ever since.” (bevin, Moon of Alabama)</p></blockquote>
<p>That perfectly summarizes the man; an empty gourd who never had any intention of fulfilling his promises, who has utter disdain for the fools that voted for him, and who finds it as easy to kill a man, his family and his kids, as to swat a fly on his forearm. As bevin notes Obama “is a pure confidence man and a sociopath.”</p>
<p>And now the sociopath has focused his attention on Ukraine where he’s determined to draw Russia into a conflict over the Crimea even though Moscow has assisted the US in the War on Terror, removed its heavy weapons from the Western part of Russia, reduced its conventional military by 300,000 troops, and fulfilled all its obligations under the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces Treaty in Europe (ACAF).</p>
<p>Moscow has done everything that was asked of it. And what has Washington done in return. Here’s how Valentin Mândrăşescu, Editor of The Voice of Russia’s Reality Check, sums it up on the Testosterone Pit website:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Washington has defaulted on all of its key agreements made with USSR/Russia during the last 30 years. Gorbachev was promised that Eastern Europe would not be taken into NATO. Country by country became part of NATO and Yugoslavia was dismantled despite Russia’s objections. The US acted as the winner of the Cold War and guided its policies by the famous principle of “Vae victis!” Woe to the vanquished!” (Valentin Mândrăşescu, Editor of The Voice of Russia’s Reality Check, <a href="http://www.testosteronepit.com/home/2014/3/10/from-now-on-no-compromises-are-possible-for-russia.html" target="_blank">From now on, No compromises are possible with Russia</a>, Testosterone Pit)</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the US has surrounded Russia with military bases, trained troops in Georgia that were eventually used to fight Russia in South Ossetia, instigated numerous color-coded revolutions in former Soviet states, and started to deploy a missile defense system in Eastern Europe that will give Washington first-strike nuclear weapons capability that will destroy “the strategic equilibrium in the world” and force Putin to resume the arms race.</p>
<p>That’s how Washington makes friends; by stomping their face into the pavement every chance it gets. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Obama met with Ukraine’s imposter prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, at the White House in a attempt to lend credibility to the coup leader’s Nazi-strew government. Obama used the White House event to applaud the putsch and to promise support for the aggressively anti-Kremlin government. Shortly after Obama finished his statement, blogsites released copies of a resolution that was issued by the European Parliament just 15 months earlier condemning the groups which are now part of the US-backed Ukrainian government. Here’s a blurb from the text of that resolution:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The European Parliament…Is concerned about the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine, expressed in support for the Svoboda Party, which, as a result, is one of the two new parties to enter the Verkhovna Rada; recalls that racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic views go against the EU’s fundamental values and principles and therefore appeals to pro-democratic parties in the Verkhovna Rada not to associate with, endorse or form coalitions with this party.” (<a href="http://www.moonofalabama.org/2014/03/ukraine-eu-parliament-warns-of-association-with-svoboda.html#comments" target="_blank">Moon of Alabama</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>How do you like that? So the European Parliament saw the danger of these groups and denounced them before they had a change of heart and realized that these died-in-the-wool, neo-Nazi, jackboot-thugs might be able to help them advance their foreign policy objectives. Now the EU nations are lining up behind Obama who’s doing his level-best to provoke Putin so he can push NATO to Russia’s borders, take control of critical pipeline corridors and vital resources, and install weapons systems on Russia’s perimeter. These are the administration’s goals despite the threat they pose to democracy, security, and regional stability, not to mention the possibility of a third world war.</p>
<p>Bottom line: You don’t get to be “the greatest threat to world peace” without really applying yourself.</p>
<p>Obama wants to prove he’s up to the task. Regrettably, we think he is.</p>

<p>No, I don’t mean some place in the Ukraine.  For some of you who went to public school, Connecticut is in the north-eastern corner of the US, but barely.</p>
<p>I understand your confusion since Connecticut is closer to New York City than to the US.  Let’s see how Connecticut politicians constructed a situation where honest gun owners could get shot by police.  We can also prescribe a peaceful solution.</p>
<p><b>How did they get themselves into this mess?</b>  There was a huge outcry of public anguish and frustration after a crazy man murdered children at a public school in Connecticut.  The media used that emotional reaction to sell its anti-gun bigotry.  The media falsely claimed that mass murder by honest gun owners was increasing.  Yes, it is bigotry.  Bigotry is blaming the innocent, and a hundred million honest gun owners are innocent.  They don’t shoot school children, but that didn’t stop the media from blaming them.  The media blamed people like me.  Maybe they blamed you.</p>
<blockquote><p>-Politicians used a public tragedy for political gain.  In an equally crazy reaction, politicians said they would do something, do anything, even if it made us less safe.  They outlawed common firearms.  Connecticut politicians ignored the rights of the voters in doing so.  They also ignored the facts about mass violence.  The reason is simple.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Connecticut politicians put their political careers ahead of public safety.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connecticut gun owners protested as the anti-gun bill went through the legislature, but they were ignored by the Democrat majority.  After the Democrat politicians outlawed common firearms, the citizens returned the favor.  Connecticut gun owners largely ignored the new laws.</li>
<li>Politicians exposed their ill will.  Some gun owners registered their guns as dictated.  Others ignored the new regulations.  Those who registered their firearms late were rejected and <a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2014/02/connecticut-tells-gun-owners-destroy-or-hand-over-rifles-standard-capacity-magaznies/" target="_blank">ordered to sell their firearms out of state or surrender them to police.</a>  That proves gun registration was never the point of the anti-gun legislation.</li>
<li>Gun owners asked the state police if they would go door to door and seize firearms.  The police said they would follow orders.  <a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2014/02/ct-state-police-would-participate-in-gun-confiscations/" target="_blank">Police spokesmen also questioned the patriotism</a> of Connecticut gun owners.  Wise policemen do not deliberately alienate and frighten honest citizens.  Some Connecticut police are not that smart.</li>
<li>Connecticut newspapers called for door-to-door searches and gun confiscation.  That further frightened Connecticut gun owners.  The idea of midnight no-knock raids frightens me too.  It should frighten you.</li>
<li>-The gun law was challenged in court, but lower courts refused to enjoin the legislation until the appeal is completed.  This means the legislature and police can trample the rights of Connecticut gun owners for years to come.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>In total</b>, legislators, judges and the media showed stunning bigotry and lack of respect for political minorities.  Their bias is as blatant as watching a southern judge during the Jim Crow era.</p>
<p><b>Where we are today?</b>  Connecticut has an unenforceable law on its books.  So many gun owners refused to follow the law that Connecticut does not have the physical or fiscal means to enforce their law.  The ranks of law enforcement, the number of courts, and the number of prisons would have to grow ten fold.  The costs of court trials and prison incarcerations are enough to bankrupt the state.  There are other costs as well.</p>
<div>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hSo37wpKaNI" height="281" width="500" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><b>How could the situation get worse?</b>  Police have murdered innocent civilians during no-knock raids.  It is a sad fact, but it <b>has</b> happened.  Examples are <a title=" Home&gt; U.S. Man Dies in Police Raid on Wrong House" href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95475" target="_blank">here 1</a> and <a title="police-kill-80-year-old-man-in-his-bed-after-claiming-his-house-smelled-like-meth" href="http://www.policestateusa.com/2013/police-kill-80-year-old-man-in-his-bed-after-claiming-his-house-smelled-like-meth/" target="_blank">here 2</a> and <a title="Cop's Shot Innocent Man 16 Times While In Bed" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSo37wpKaNI" target="_blank">a video here 3.</a>  Though the media will try and cover for them, police and politicians will have blood on their hands if they injure civilian gun owners during firearm confiscation.  Police violence will further heighten the fear felt by honest gun owners in Connecticut.  Connecticut gun owners could try to defend themselves if people violently break into their homes.  This could lead to further bloodshed for all concerned.  Police and politicians would then be seen as murderous oppressors rather than defenders of a fair and impartial justice system.</p>
<p>Respect for Connecticut law enforcement and politicians would plummet even further.  Law enforcement officers would lose community support.  Crime and violence would increase.</p>
<p>That is bad.</p>
<p>The police could conduct door to door sweeps with armed and armored personnel carriers rolling down the street as they did after the Boston Marathon bombing.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, Connecticut could become a police state over this politicized issue.</strong></p>
<p>That is worse.</p>
<p><b>Is forced disarmament necessary?</b>  Going door to door in no-knock midnight raids is foolishly dangerous.  It is also profoundly unnecessary.  Honest gun owners present no danger to the public.  They never did.  If Connecticut gun owners are a threat at all, they threaten the public image of bigoted politicians who now look politically foolish and publicly inept.</p>
<p><b>How can this situation de-escalate peacefully?</b>  There are lawsuits in place against the Connecticut gun law.  Let the judicial process work to protect the rights of minorities.  Enjoin the law as the case slowly grinds its way through the courts.</p>
<p>The political solution is to lobby the legislators in person, and some online media have posted lists of legislators who supported gun confiscation.  Some politicians view that publicity with alarm.  They are wrong.  You should not be a politician if you don’t want to see the faces of the people affected by your laws.  An isolated and insulated ruling class is a sure way to violence.</p>
<p>Let the courts settle this.</p>

<p>When one studies history, all events seem to revolve around the applications and degenerations of war. Great feats of human understanding, realization and enlightenment barely register in the mental footnotes of the average person. War is what we remember, idealize and aggrandize, which is why war is the tool most often exploited by oligarchy to distract the masses while it centralizes power.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few revolutions, most wars are instigated and controlled by financial elites, manipulating governments on both sides of the game to produce a preconceived result. The rise of National Socialism in Germany, for instance, was largely funded by corporate entities based in the U.S., including Rockefeller giant Standard Oil, JPMorgan and even IBM, which built the collating machines specifically used to organize Nazi extermination camps, the same machines <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/29/humanities.highereducation">IBM representatives serviced on site at places like Auschwitz</a>. As a public figure, Adolf Hitler was considered a joke by most people in German society, until, of course, the Nazi Party received incredible levels of corporate investment. This aid was most evident in what came to be known as the Keppler Fund created through the Keppler Circle, a group of interests with contacts largely based in the U.S.</p>
<p>George W. Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, used his position as director of the New York-based Union Banking Corporation to launder money for the Third Reich throughout the war. After being exposed and charged for trading with the enemy, the case against Bush magically disappeared in a puff of smoke, and the Bush family went on to become one of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar" target="_blank">most powerful political forces</a> in America.</p>
<p>Without the aid of international conglomerates and banks, the Third Reich would have never risen to power.</p>
<p>The rise of communism in Russia through the Bolshevik Revolution was no different. As outlined in Professor Antony Sutton’s book <em>Wall Street And The Bolshevik Revolution</em> with vast detail and irrefutable supporting evidence, it was globalist financiers that created the social petri dish in which the communist takeover flourished.  The same financiers that aided the Nazis&#8230;</p>
<p>The two sides, National Socialism and communism, were essentially identical despotic governmental structures conjured by the same group of elites. These two sides, these two fraudulent ideologies, were then pitted against each other in an engineered conflict that we now call World War II, resulting in an estimated 48 million casualties globally and the ultimate formation of the United Nations, a precursor to world government.</p>
<p>Every major international crisis for the past century or more has ended with an even greater consolidation of world power into the hands of the few, and this is no accident.</p>
<p>When I discuss the concept of the false left/right paradigm with people, especially those in the liberty movement, I often see a light turn on, a moment of awareness in their faces. Many of us understand the con game because we live it day to day. We see past the superficial rhetoric of Republican and Democratic party leadership and take note of their numerous similarities, including foreign policy, domestic defense policy and economic policy. The voting records of the major players in both parties are almost identical. One is hard-pressed to find much difference in ideology between Bush and Barack Obama, for example; or Obama and John McCain; or Obama and Mitt Romney, for that matter.</p>
<p>When I suggest, however, that similar false paradigms are used between two apparently opposed nations, the light fades, and people are left dumbstruck. Despite the fact that globalist financiers shoveled capital into the U.S., British, German and Soviet military complexes all at the same time during World War II, many Americans do not want to believe that such a thing could be happening today.</p>
<p>In response, I present the crisis in Ukraine versus the crisis in Syria&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Ukraine Versus Syria</strong></p>
<p>It seems as though much of the public has already forgotten that at the end of 2013, the U.S. came within a razor’s edge of economic disaster — not to mention the possibility of World War III. The war drums in Washington were thundering for “intervention” in Syria and the overthrow of Bashar Assad. The only thing that saved us, I believe, were the tireless efforts of the independent media in exposing the darker motives behind the Syrian insurgency and the bloodlust of the Obama Administration. The problem is that when the elites lose one avenue toward war and distraction, they have a tendency to simply create another. Eventually, the public is so overwhelmed by multiple trigger points and political powder kegs that they lose track of reality. I often call this the “scattergun effect.”</p>
<p>The crisis in the Ukraine is almost a carbon copy of the civil war in Syria, culminating in what I believe to be the exact same intent.</p>
<p><strong>The Money</strong></p>
<p>Money from globalist centers has been flowing into the Ukrainian opposition since at least 2004, when the Carnegie Foundation was caught <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041211/news_1n11usaid.html" target="_blank">filtering funds</a> to anti-Russian political candidate Viktor Yushchenko, as well as to the groups who supported him.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Supreme Court called for a runoff due to massive voter fraud and the rise of the pro-Western Orange Revolution, determining the winner to be Yushchenko over none other than Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych went on to win the 2010 elections, and the revolution returned to oust him this year.</p>
<p>It has been discovered that the current revolution has also been receiving funds from NATO and U.S. interests, not just from the State Department, but also from billionaires like <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/28/pierre-omidyar-co-funded-ukraine-revolution-groups-with-us-government-documents-show/" target="_blank">Pierre Omidyar</a>, the chairman of eBay and the new boss of journalist Glen Greenwald, the same journalist who is now famous for being the first to expose National Security Agency documents obtained by Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>Much of the monetary support from such financiers was being funneled to men like Oleh Rybachuk, the right-hand man to Yanukovych during the Orange Revolution and a favorite of neoconservatives and the State Department in the U.S.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/imf-ready-respond-ukraines-aid-bid-22696497" target="_blank">International Monetary Fund</a> has also jumped at the chance to throw money at the new Ukrainian regime, which would prevent default of the country and allow the opposition movement to focus their attentions on Russia.</p>
<p>The revolution in Syria was also primarily driven by Western funds and arms transferred through training grounds like Benghazi, Libya. There is much evidence to suggest that the<a href="http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/01/exclusive-dozens-of-cia-operatives-on-the-ground-during-benghazi-attack/" target="_blank">attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi</a> was designed to possibly cover up the arming of Syrian rebels by the CIA, who had agents on the ground who still have not been allowed to testify in front of Congress.</p>
<p>After this conspiracy was exposed in the mainstream, globalist-controlled governments decided to openly supply money and weapons to the Syrian insurgency, instead of ending the subterfuge.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Rebels’</strong></p>
<p>Some revolutions are quite real in their intent and motivations. But many either become co-opted by elites through financing, or they are created from thin air from the very beginning. Usually, the rebellions that are completely fabricated tend to lean toward extreme zealotry.</p>
<p>The Syrian insurgency is rife with, if not entirely dominated by, men associated with al-Qaida. Governments in the U.S. and Israel continue to support the insurgency despite their open affiliation with a group that is supposedly our greatest enemy. Syrian insurgents have been recorded committing numerous atrocities, including mass execution, the torture of civilians and even the cannibalism of human organs.</p>
<p>The revolution in Ukraine is run primarily by the Svoboda Party, a National Socialist (fascist) organization headed by Oleh Tyahnybok.  Here is a photo of Tyahnybok giving a familiar salute:</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.alt-market.com/images/stories/tyahnybok.jpg" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>So far, the opposition in Ukraine has been mostly careful in avoiding the same insane displays of random violence that plagued the Syrians’ public image. It is important to remember though that mainstream outlets like <em>Reuters</em> went far out of their way in attempts to humanize Syrian al-Qaida. Their methods were exposed only through the vigilance of the independent media. With the fascist Svoboda in power in the Ukraine, I believe it is only a matter of time before we see video reports of similar atrocities, giving Russia a perfect rationalization to use military force.</p>
<p><strong>John McCain?</strong></p>
<p>I am now thoroughly convinced that John McCain is a pasty ghoul of the highest order. He claims to be conservative yet supports almost every action of the Obama Administration. He is constantly defending anti-Constitutional actions by the Federal government, including the Enemy Belligerents Act, which was eventually melded into the National Defense Authorization Act; NSA surveillance of U.S. citizens; and even <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/25/schumer-mccain-say-gun-control-bills-will-return/" target="_blank">gun control</a>.</p>
<p>And for some reason, the guy makes appearances like clockwork right before or during major overthrows of existing governments. McCain was in Libya <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/libya-war-sen-john-mccain-visits-libyan-rebels/story?id=13439370" target="_blank">during the coup</a> against Moammar Gadhafi.</p>
<p>McCain showed up to essentially buy off the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/02/tunisia-mccain-meets-leaders-calls-revolution-very-successful.html" target="_blank">rebels in Tunisia</a>.</p>
<p>McCain hung out with <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/27/18536111-mccain-slips-into-syria-to-meet-with-rebel-leaders?lite" target="_blank">al-Qaida in Syria</a>.</p>
<p>And, what a surprise, McCain met with the Ukrainian opposition movement just before the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych.  Here is a photo of McCain giving a speech to the opposition with none other than Neo-Nazi Oleh Tyahnybok standing over his left shoulder.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.alt-market.com/images/stories/mccainnazi.jpg" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>Why McCain? I have no idea. All I know is, if this guy shows up in your country, take cover.</p>
<p><strong>Russia In The Middle</strong></p>
<p>The great danger in Syria was not necessarily the chance of war with Assad. Rather, it was the chance that a war with Assad would expand into a larger conflagration with Iran and Russia. Russia’s only naval facility in the Mideast is on the coast of Tartus in Syria, and Russia has long-standing economic and political ties to Syria and Iran. Any physical action by the West in the region would have elicited a response from Vladimir Putin. The mainstream argument claims that the threat of Russian intervention scared off Obama, but I believe the only reason war actions were not executed by the White House and the globalists was because they didn’t have even minimal support from the general public. For any war, you need at least a moderate percentage of the population to back your play.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, we find the globalists creating tensions between the West and the East yet again. Russia’s most vital naval base sits in Crimea, an autonomous state tethered to the Ukrainian mainland. Currently, Russia has flooded Crimea with troops in response to the regime change in Ukraine. The new Ukrainian government (backed by NATO) has called this an “invasion” and an act of war, while Western warmongers like McCain and Lindsay Graham spread <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/02/lindsey-graham-calls-obama-weak-indecisive-war-russia.html" target="_blank">the propaganda meme</a> that Russia made such a move only because Putin believes the Obama Administration to be “weak.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the idea here is to engineer either high tensions or eventual war between Russia and the United States. Syria failed to produce the desired outcome, so the Ukraine was tapped instead.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Markets And The Dollar At Risk</strong></p>
<p>In Syria, any U.S. led military action would have resulted in the immediate closing of the Straight of Hormuz by Iran, threatening to obstruct up to 30% of global petroleum shipments.  Foreign resentment could have easily led to the abandonment of the U.S. dollar as the petro-currency.  Both China and Russia implied the possibility of an economic response to American intervention, though they did not officially go into specifics.  In all likelihood, the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status would have been damaged irrevocably.</p>
<p>In the Ukraine, the chance of intervention has been countered with VERY specific threats from Russia, including <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/03/europes-dependence-on-russian-oil-and-gas-makes-it-hard-to-enact-meaningful-trade-sanctions/">a freeze on natural gas imports to the European Union through Gazprom</a>, which supplies approximately 30% of the EU&#8217;s fuel.  In 2009, a temporary Ukranian pipeline closure led to widespread shortages across Europe.  While some in the mainstream claim that Russia&#8217;s influence over EU energy has &#8220;diminished&#8221; the fact is a loss of 30% of natural gas reserves for an extended period would inflate energy prices wildly and cripple the EU&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>Another specific reaction given by Russia is the <a href="http://en.ria.ru/business/20140304/188081405/Putin-Adviser-Urges-Dumping-US-Bonds-In-Reaction-to-Sanctions.html">dumping of U.S. treasury bonds</a>.  Russia&#8217;s bond holdings may not seem like much leverage, except for the fact that China has now publicly backed Russian efforts in the Ukraine, just as they backed Russian opposition to U.S. activities in Syria.  A dump of bonds by Russia would invariably be followed by a Chinese dump as well.  In fact, China and Russia have been setting the stage for a global dollar decoupling since at least 2008.   I have been warning for years that globalists and central bankers needed a &#8220;cover event&#8221;, a distraction or scapegoat imposing enough to provide a veil of chaos in which they could then destroy the greenback as the world reserve and usher in a global currency system.  The Ukraine crisis offers yet another opportunity for this plan to unfold.</p>
<p><strong>The False Paradigm And The Globalist Chessboard</strong></p>
<p>So far, I have outlined what appears to be a correspondence of conspiracy between Syria and the Ukraine and how each event has the continued potential to trigger regional conflict, dollar collapse, or world war. But is this conspiracy one-sided? Are only the West and NATO being manipulated by globalists to box in Russia and provoke a conflict? And what do globalists have to gain by sparking such disaster?</p>
<p>As with every other catastrophic fabricated war, the goal is the erasure of sovereign identity while consolidating of economic, political and social power. It is not enough that global financiers dominate the banking industry and own most politicians; they want to transform the public psyche. They want US to ask THEM for global governance. This manufacture of consent is often achieved by pitting two controlled governments against each other and then, in the wake of the tragedy, calling for global unification. The argument is always presented that if we simply abandoned the concept of nation states and reform under a single world body, all war would “disappear.”</p>
<p>The question is whether Russia’s Putin is aware of the plan. Is he a part of it?  Are we seeing repeat theater of a puppet Russia versus a puppet NATO like that witnessed during the Cold War?</p>
<p>What I do know is that Putin has, a number of times in the past, called for global control of the economy through the IMF and the institution of a new global currency using the <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html" target="_blank">IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR)</a>.</p>
<p>Loans from the IMF are what saved Russia from debt default in the late 1990s. And Putin has recently called for consultations with the IMF concerning Crimea. Remember, this is the same IMF that is <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/russia-and-former-soviet-union/putin-seeks-ukraine-financial-aid-consultations-with-imf-g8-337851.html" target="_blank">working to fund his opponents</a> in Western Ukraine.</p>
<p>Bottom line, if you believe in national sovereignty and decentralization of power, Putin is NOT your buddy. Once again, we have the globalists injecting money into both sides of a conflict which could morph into something nightmarish.  Putin wants global economic governance and consolidation under the IMF just as much as the supposedly &#8220;American-run&#8221; IMF wants consolidation.  Global governance of finance and money creation ultimately means global governance of everything else.</p>
<p>Is a war being created through the false paradigm of East versus West in order to pave the road for global government?  Are East/West tensions being exploited as a smokescreen for the final destruction of the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status?  It is hard to say if the Ukraine will be the final trigger; however, the evidence suggests that if a conflict occurs, regardless of who “wins” such a scenario, the IMF comes out on top.</p>
<p>Imagine you are playing a game of chess by yourself. Which side wins at the end of that game: black or white? The answer is it doesn’t matter. You always win when you control both sides.</p>

<h3>“At last the world knows America as the savior of the world!” – President Woodrow Wilson, Paris Peace Conference, 1919</h3>
<p>The horrors reported each day from Syria and Iraq are enough to make one cry; in particular, the atrocities carried out by the al-Qaeda types: floggings; beheadings; playing soccer with the heads; cutting open dead bodies to remove organs just for mockery; suicide bombers, car bombs, the ground littered with human body parts; countless young children traumatized for life; the imposition of <em>sharia</em> law, including bans on music … What century are we living in? What millennium? What world?</p>
<p>People occasionally write to me that my unwavering antagonism toward American foreign policy is misplaced; that as awful as Washington’s Museum of Horrors is, al-Qaeda is worse and the world needs the United States to combat the awful jihadists.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you about the very rich,” F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote. “They are different from you and me.”</p>
<p>And let me tell you about American leaders. In power, they don’t think the way you and I do. They don’t feel the way you and I do. They have supported “awful jihadists” and their moral equivalents for decades. Let’s begin in 1979 in Afghanistan, where the <em>Moujahedeen</em> (“holy warriors”) were in battle against a secular, progressive government supported by the Soviet Union; a “favorite tactic” of the <em>Moujahedeen</em> was “to torture victims [often Russians] by first cutting off their nose, ears, and genitals, then removing one slice of skin after another”, producing “a slow, very painful death”.</p>
<p>With America’s massive and indispensable military backing in the 1980s, Afghanistan’s last secular government (bringing women into the 20th century) was overthrown, and out of the victorious<em>Moujahedeen</em> arose al Qaeda.</p>
<p>During this same period the United States was supporting the infamous <em>Khmer Rouge</em> of Cambodia; yes, the same charming lads of Pol Pot and The Killing Fields.</p>
<p>President Carter’s National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was a leading force behind the US support of both the <em>Moujahedeen</em> and the <em>Khmer Rouge</em>. What does that tell you about that American leader? Or Jimmy Carter – an inspiration out of office, but a rather different person in the White House? Or Nobel Peace Laureate Barack Obama, who chose Brzezinski as one of his advisers?</p>
<p>Another proud example of the United States fighting the awful jihadists is Kosovo, an overwhelmingly Muslim province of Serbia. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began an armed conflict with Belgrade in the early 1990s to split Kosovo from Serbia. The KLA was considered a terrorist organization by the US, the UK and France for years, with numerous reports of the KLA having contact with al-Qaeda, getting arms from them, having its militants trained in al-Qaeda camps in Pakistan, and even having members of al-Qaeda in KLA ranks fighting against Serbia.  But Washington’s imperialists, more concerned about dealing a blow to Serbia, “the last communist government in Europe”, supported the KLA.</p>
<p>The KLA have been known for their torture and trafficking in women, heroin, and human body parts (sic).  The United States has naturally been pushing for Kosovo’s membership in NATO and the European Union.</p>
<p>More recently the US has supported awful jihadists in Libya and Syria, with awful consequences.</p>
<p>It would, moreover, be difficult to name a single brutal dictatorship of the second half of the 20th Century that was not supported by the United States; not only supported, but often put into power and kept in power against the wishes of the population. And in recent years as well, Washington has supported very repressive governments, such as Saudi Arabia, Honduras, Indonesia, Egypt, Colombia, Qatar, and Israel.</p>
<p>Not exactly the grand savior our sad old world is yearning for. (Oh, did I mention that Washington’s policies create a never-ending supply of terrorists?)</p>
<p>And what do American leaders think of their own record? Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was probably speaking for the whole private club when she wrote that in the pursuit of its national security the United States no longer needed to be guided by “notions of international law and norms” or “institutions like the United Nations” because America was “on the right side of history.”</p>
<h3>If you’ve never done anything you wouldn’t want the government to know about, you should re-examine your life choices.</h3>
<p>“The idea is to build an antiterrorist global environment,” a senior American defense official said in 2003, “so that in 20 to 30 years, terrorism will be like slave-trading, completely discredited.”</p>
<p>One must wonder: When will the dropping of bombs on innocent civilians by the United States, and invading and occupying their country become completely discredited? When will the use of depleted uranium, cluster bombs, CIA torture renditions, and round-the-world, round-the-clock surveillance become things that even men like George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Barack Obama, and John Brennan will be too embarrassed to defend?</p>
<p>Last month, a former National Security Agency official told the Washington Post that the Agency’s workers are polishing up their résumés and asking that they be cleared – removing any material linked to classified programs – so they can be sent out to potential employers. He noted that one employee who processes the résumés said, “I’ve never seen so many résumés that people want to have cleared in my life.”</p>
<p>Morale is “bad overall”, said another former official. “The news – the Snowden disclosures – it questions the integrity of the NSA workforce,” he said. “It’s become very public and very personal. Literally, neighbors are asking people, ‘Why are you spying on Grandma?’ And we aren’t. People are feeling bad, beaten down.”</p>
<p>President Obama was recently moved to declare that he would be proposing “some self-restraint on the NSA” and “some reforms that can give people more confidence.” He also said “In some ways, the technology and the budgets and the capacity [at NSA] have outstripped the constraints. And we’ve got to rebuild those in the same way that we’re having to do on a whole series of capacities … [such as] drone operations.”</p>
<p>Well, dear readers and comrades, we shall see. But if you’re looking for a glimmer of hope to begin a new year, you may as well try grabbing onto these little offerings. When the American Empire crumbles, abroad and at home, as one day it must, Edward Snowden’s courageous actions may well be seen as one of the key steps along that road. I’ve long maintained that only the American people have the power to stop The Imperial Machine – the monster that eats the world’s environment, screws up its economies, and spews violence on every continent. And for that to happen the American people have to lose their deep-seated, quasi-religious belief in “American Exceptionalism”. For many, what they’ve been forced to learn the past six months has undoubtedly worn deep holes into the protective armor that has surrounded their hearts and minds since childhood.</p>
<p>A surprising and exhilarating example of one of these holes in the armor is the New Year’s day editorial in the <em>New York Times</em> that is now well known. Entitled “Edward Snowden, Whistle-blower” – itself a legitimation of his actions – its key part says: “Considering the enormous value of the information he has revealed, and the abuses he has exposed, Mr. Snowden deserves better than a life of permanent exile, fear and flight. He may have committed a crime to do so, but he has done his country a great service.”</p>
<p>The president has been moved to appoint a committee to study NSA abuses. This of course is a standard bureaucratic maneuver to keep critics at bay. But the committee – Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies – did come up with a few unexpected recommendations in its report presented December 13, the most interesting of which perhaps are these two:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Governments should not use surveillance to steal industry secrets to advantage their domestic industry.”</p>
<p>“Governments should not use their offensive cyber capabilities to change the amounts held in financial accounts or otherwise manipulate the financial systems.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The first recommendation refers to a practice, though certainly despicable, that is something the United States has been doing, and lying about, for decades.  Just this past September, James Clapper, Director of US National Intelligence, declared: “What we do not do, as we have said many times, is use our foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies.”</p>
<p>Clapper is the same gentleman who told Congress in March that the NSA does not intentionally collect any kind of data on millions of Americans; and, when subsequently challenged on this remark, declared: “I responded in what I thought was the most truthful, or least untruthful, manner by saying ‘no’.”</p>
<p>The second recommendation had not been revealed before, in a Snowden document or from any other source.</p>
<p>“That was a strangely specific recommendation for something nobody was talking about,” observed the director of a government transparency group.</p>
<p><em>ABC News</em> reported that “A spokesperson for the NSA declined to comment on the issue of bank account hacking, and a representative for U.S. Cyber Command did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.”</p>
<p>Manipulating bank records is about as petty and dishonorable as a superpower can behave, and could conceivably, eventually, lead to the end of the NSA as we’ve all come to know and love it. On the other hand, the Agency no doubt holds some very embarrassing information about anyone in a position to do them harm.</p>
<h3>The bombing of Flight 103 – Case closed?</h3>
<p>When the 25th anniversary of the 1988 bombing of PanAm Flight 103 occurred on December 21 I was fully expecting the usual repetitions of the false accusation against Libya and Moammar Gaddafi as being responsible for the act which took the lives of 270 people over and in Lockerbie, Scotland. But much to my surprise, mingled with such, there were a rash of comments skeptical of the official British-US version, made by various people in Scotland and elsewhere, including by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Libya.</p>
<p>In a joint statement the three governments said they were determined to unearth the truth behind the attack. “We want all those responsible for this brutal act of terrorism brought to justice, and to understand why it was committed”, they declared.</p>
<p>Remarkable. In 1991, the United States indicted a Libyan named Adelbaset al-Megrahi. He was eventually found guilty of being the sole perpetrator of the crime, kept in prison for many years, and finally released in 2009 when he had terminal cancer, allegedly for humanitarian reasons, although an acute smell of oil could be detected. And now they speak of bringing to justice “those responsible for this brutal act of terrorism”.</p>
<p>The 1988 crime was actually organized by Iran in retaliation for the American shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in July of the same year, which took the lives of 290 people. It was carried out by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine &#8211; General Command (PFLP-GC), a 1968 breakaway from a component of the Palestine Liberation Organization, with some help from Syria. And this version was very widely accepted in the Western world, in government and media circles. Until the US buildup to the Gulf War came along in 1990 and the support of Iran and Syria was needed. Then, suddenly, we were told that it was Libya behind the crime.</p>
<p>If the US and UK now wish to return to Iran, and perhaps Syria, as the culprits, they will have a lot of explaining to do about their previous lie. But these two governments always have a lot of explaining to do. They’re good at it. And the great bulk of their indoctrinated citizens, with little resistance, will accept the new/old party line, and their mainstream media will effortlessly switch back to the old/new official version, since Iran and Syria are at the top of the current list of Bad Guys. (The PFLP-GC has been quiescent for some time and may scarcely exist.)</p>
<p>If you’re confused by all this, I suggest that you start by <a href="http://williamblum.org/essays/read/the-bombing-of-panam-flight-103-case-not-closed">reading my detailed article on the history of this case</a>, written in 2001 but still very informative and relevant. You may be rather surprised.</p>
<p>The UK, US and Libyan governments have now announced that they will co-operate to reveal “the full facts” of the Lockerbie bombing. And Robert Mueller, the former head of the FBI, said he believes more people will be charged. This could be very interesting.</p>

<p>There is instead an apparent global conspiracy of authorities of all sorts to deny to the public reliably accurate, comprehensible, independently verifiable (where possible), and comprehensive information about not only the condition of the Fukushima power plant itself and its surrounding communities, but about the unceasing, uncontrolled release of radioactive debris into the air and water, creating a constantly increasing risk of growing harm to the global community.</p>
<p>While the risk may still be miniscule in most places, the range of risk rises to lethal in Fukushima itself. With the radioactive waste of four nuclear reactors (three of them in meltdown) under uncertain control for almost three years now, the risk of lethal exposure is very real for plant workers, and may decrease with distance from the plant, but may be calculable for anyone on the planet. No one seems to know. No one seems to have done the calculation. No one with access to the necessary information (assuming it exists) seems to want to do the calculation.</p>
<p>There is no moral excuse for this international collusion. The excuses are political or economic or social, but none of them excuses any authority for withholding or lying about information that has potentially universal and destructive impact on everyone alive today and everyone to be born for some unknown generations.</p>
<p><a href="http://fairewinds.org/media/fairewinds-videos/arnie-comments-fukushima-foia-documents" target="_blank">Japanese authorities</a> may be the worst current offenders against the truth, as well as the health and safety of their people. Now the <a href="http://rt.com/news/japan-state-secrets-law-712/" target="_blank">Japanese government</a> has passed a harsh <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/12/31/258655342/japans-state-secrets-law-hailed-by-u-s-denounced-by-japanese" target="_blank">state secrets law</a> that threatens to reduce or eliminate reliable information about Fukushima. The U.S. government officially applauded this <a href="http://rt.com/news/japan-state-secrets-law-712/" target="_blank">heightened secrecy</a>, while continuing its own tight control on nuclear information. Japanese authorities are already <a href="http://fairewinds.org/media/fairewinds-videos/japanese-government-isnt-saying-fukushima" target="_blank">attacking their own people</a> in defense of nuclear power: not only under-measuring and ignoring varieties of radioactive threat, but even withholding the iodine pills in 2011 that might have mitigated the <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1388611/surge-cancers-among-young-fukushima-experts-divided-cause" target="_blank">growing epidemic</a> of thyroid issues today. Failing to confront Fukushima honestly, the Japanese are laying the basis for what could amount to a radiological sneak attack on the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Just because no one seems to know what to do about Fukushima is no excuse to go on lying about and/or denying the dimensions of reality, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>There are hundreds, probably thousands of people with little or no authority who have long struggled to create a realistic, rational perspective on nuclear threats. The fundamental barrier to knowing the scale of the Fukushima disaster is just that: the scale of the Fukushima disaster.</p>
<h4>Chernobyl 1986 and Fukushima 2011 are Not Really Comparable</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant" target="_blank">Chernobyl</a> is the closest precedent to Fukushima, and it’s not very close. Chernobyl at the time of the 1986 electric failure and explosion had four operating reactors and two more under construction. The Chernobyl accident involved one reactor meltdown. Other reactors kept operating for some time after the accident. The rector meltdown was eventually entombed, containing the meltdown and reducing the risk. Until Fukushima, Chernobyl was considered the worst nuclear power accident in history, and it is still far from over (albeit largely contained for the time being). The Chernobyl <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone" target="_blank">Exclusion Zone</a> of roughly 1,000 square miles remains one of the most radioactive areas in the world and the clean-up is not even expected to be complete before 2065.</p>
<p>At the time of the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster" target="_blank">Fukushima plant</a> had six operating reactors. Three of them went into meltdown and a fourth was left with a heavily laden fuel pool teetering a hundred feet above the ground. Two other reactors were undamaged and have been shut down. Radiation levels remain lethal in each of the melted-down reactors, where the meltdowns appear to be held in check by water that is pumped into the reactors to keep them cool. In the process, the water gets irradiated and that which is not collected on site in leaking tanks flows steadily into the Pacific Ocean. Within the first two weeks, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20285-fukushima-radioactive-fallout-nears-chernobyl-levels.html?full=true&amp;print=true#.UsSYgmRDuVs" target="_blank">Fukushima radiation</a> was comparable to Chernobyl’s and while the levels have gone down, they remain elevated.</p>
<p>The plant’s corporate owner, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Electric_Power_Company" target="_blank">Tokyo Electric Power</a> Company (TEPCO), in turn effectively owned by the Japanese government after a <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/05/tepco%E2%80%99s-nationalisation" target="_blank">2012 nationalization</a>, began removing more than 1,500 <a href="http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/nu/fukushima-np/removal4u/index-e.html" target="_blank">fuel rod assemblies</a> from the teetering fuel pool in November, a delicate process expected to take a year or more. There are additional fuel pools attached to each of the melted down reactors and a much larger general fuel pool, all of which contain nuclear fuel rod assemblies that are secure only as long as TEPCO continues to cool them. The Fukushima Exclusion Zone, a 12-mile radius around the nuclear plant, is about 500 square miles (much of it ocean); little <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/return-to-the-radiation-zone-fukushima-cleanup-operation-mired-in-fear-and-misinformation-8810158.html" target="_blank">specific information</a> about the exclusion zone is easily available, but <a href="http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,2064134,00.html" target="_blank">media coverage</a> in the form of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/video/inside-japans-fukushima-exclusion-zone-15524477" target="_blank">disaster tourism</a> is plentiful, including a<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/imagery-on-google-maps-of-fukushima.html" target="_blank">Google Street View</a> interactive display.</p>
<p>Despite their significant differences as disasters, Chernobyl and Fukushima are both rated at 7 — a “major accident” on the International <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale" target="_blank">Nuclear Event Scale</a> designed in 1990 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That is the highest rating on the scale, a reflection of the inherent denial that colors most official nuclear thinking. Designed by nuclear “experts” after Chernobyl, the scale can’t imagine a worse accident than Chernobyl which, for all its intensity, was effectively over as an accident in a relatively short period of time. At Fukushima, by contrast, the initial set of events was less acute than Chernobyl, but almost three years later they continue without any resolution likely soon. Additionally Fukushima has three reactor meltdowns and thousands of precarious fuel rod assemblies in uncertain pools, any of which could produce a new crisis that would put Fukushima clearly off the scale.</p>
<p>And then there’s groundwater. Groundwater was not a problem at Chernobyl. Groundwater is a huge problem at the Fukushima plant that was built at the seashore, on a former riverbed, over an active aquifer. In a <a href="http://fairewinds.org/uncategorized/fukushima-daiichi-hard-clean" target="_blank">short video</a>, nuclear engineer Arnie Gunderson makes clear why groundwater makes Fukushima so hard to clean up, and why radiation levels there will likely remain dangerous for another hundred years.</p>
<h4>Fukushima Unit #3 Activity Led to Some Panic-Driven Reporting in 2013</h4>
<p>The Japanese government and nuclear power industry have a history of not telling the truth about nuclear accidents dating back at least to 1995, as reported by <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20263-japans-record-of-nuclear-coverups-and-accidents.html#.UsXbLmRDuVt" target="_blank"><em>New Scientist</em></a>and <a href="http://archives.politicususa.com/2011/03/15/rachel-maddow-japan-nuclear-2.html" target="_blank">Rachel Maddow</a>, among <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-17/japan-s-nuclear-disaster-caps-decades-of-faked-safety-reports-accidents.html" target="_blank">others</a>. Despite Japan’s history of nuclear dishonesty, Japanese authorities remain in total control of the Fukushima site and most of the information about it, without significant objection from most of the world’s governments, media, and other power brokers, whose reputation for honesty in nuclear matters is almost as bad as Japan’s. In such a context of no context, the public is vulnerable to <a href="http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/146-mjt" target="_blank">reports like this</a> from the <a href="http://turnerradionetwork.com/" target="_blank">Turner Radio Network</a> (TRN) on December 28:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/146-mjt" target="_blank">** NEWS FLASH — URGENT ** STEAM SUDDENLY EMANATING FROM FUKUSHIMA REACTOR # 3 — WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA SHOULD BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR POSSIBLE RADIATION CLOUD WITHIN 3 TO 5 DAYS</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/fukushima-radiation-wind-trajectories.jpg" width="300" height="200" />Five days after this story was posted, the “radiation cloud” had not developed despite the story’s assertion that: “Experts say this could be the beginning of a  spent fuel pool criticality (meltdown)’involving up to 89 TONS of nuclear fuel burning up into the atmosphere and heading to North America.” The story named no “experts” and provided links only to TEPCO announcements in Japanese. The bulk of the story reads like an infomercial for “protective” gear of various sorts that TRN makes a point of saying it does NOT sell. Despite such obvious warning signs, others — such as <a href="http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2217953/fukushima_meltdown_mystery_steam_rising_over_reactor_3.html" target="_blank"><em>The Ecologist</em></a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/radioactive-mystery-steam-over-fukushima-could-mean-ano-1492280971" target="_blank"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> — reported the threat of “another meltdown” at Fukushima Unit #3 as imminent.</p>
<p>Clarification and reassurance quickly started chasing the “new meltdown” rumor around the Internet. <a href="http://enenews.com/steam-coming-from-fukushima-unit-3-reactor-building-observed-multiple-times-this-week" target="_blank"><em>ENENEWS</em></a> (Energy News) promptly posted the TEPCO reports in English, demonstrating that there was nothing “sudden” about the steam releases, they’ve been happening more or less daily since 2011, but condensation caused by cold weather makes them visible. At <a href="http://fairewinds.org/demystifying/fukushima-daiichi-unit-3-going-explode" target="_blank"><em>FAIREWINDS</em></a> (Energy Education), Arnie Gunderson posted on January 1:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“… the Internet has been flooded with conjecture claiming that Fukushima Daiichi Unit 3 is ready to explode… Our research, and discussions with other scientists, confirms that what we are seeing is a phenomenon that has been occurring at the Daiichi site since the March 2011 accident… While the plants are shutdown in nuke speak, there is no method of achieving cold shut down in any nuclear reactor. While the reactor can stop generating the actual nuclear chain reaction,<strong> the atoms left over from the original nuclear chain reaction continue to give off heat that is called the decay of the radioactive rubble (fission products)… constantly releasing moisture (steam) and radioactive products into the environment.” </strong></em>[emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/fukushimaradiationmap3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>In other words, Fukushima Unit #3 continues to leak radioactivity into both air and water, as Units #1 and #2 presumably do as well. But as Gunderson explains, the level of radioactivity has declined sharply without becoming benign:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“When Unit 3 was operating, it was producing more than 2,000 megawatts of heat from the nuclear fission process (chain reaction in the reactor). Immediately after the earthquake and tsunami, it shut down and the chain reaction stopped, but Unit 3 was still producing about 160 megawatts of decay heat. Now, 30 months later, it is still producing slightly less than 1 megawatt (one million watts) of decay heat… 1 megawatt of decay heat is a lot of heat even today, and it is creating radioactive steam, but it is not a new phenomenon.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h4>Reassurances About Fukushima are As Misleading As Scare Stories</h4>
<p>The reassuring aspects of the condition of Unit #3 — radioactive releases are not new, they’re less intense than they once were, the nuclear waste is cooling — while true enough, provide only a false sense of comfort. Also true: radiation is released almost continuously, the releases are uncontrolled, no one seems to be measuring the releases, no one seems to be tracking the releases, no one is assessing accumulation of the releases. And while it’s true that the waste is cooling and decaying, it’s also true that a loss of coolant could lead to another uncontrolled chain reaction. (<em>“Fukushima Daiichi Unit 3 is not going to explode,”</em> says Gunderson in a headline, but he can’t know that with certainty.)</p>
<p>For the near future, what all that means, in effect, is that the world has to accept chronic radiation releases from Fukushima as the price for avoiding another catastrophic release. And even then, it’s not a sure thing.</p>
<p>But there’s another aspect of Fukushima Unit #3 that’s even less reassuring. Unit #3 is the one Fukushima reactor that was running on Mixed oxide fuel, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOX_fuel" target="_blank">MOX fuel</a>, in its fuel rods.<a href="http://www.nrc.gov/materials/fuel-cycle-fac/mox/faq.html" target="_blank">MOX fuel</a> typically uses Plutonium mixed with one or more forms of Uranium. Using<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium" target="_blank">Plutonium</a> in fuel rods adds to their toxicity in the event of a meltdown. In part because Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 240,000 years and can be used to make nuclear weapons of “dirty bombs,” its use in commercial reactors remains both <a href="http://www.nirs.org/factsheets/basicmoxinfo.htm" target="_blank">limited</a> and <a href="http://www.nirs.org/factsheets/basicmoxinfo.htm" target="_blank">controversial</a>. Because it contains Plutonium, MOX fuel is <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/03/15/mox-the-toxic-fuel-inside-japans-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-plant.html" target="_blank">more toxic</a> than other nuclear fuel and will burn at lower temperatures. As <em>Natural Resources News</em> reported in 2011:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The mixed oxide fuel rods used in the compromised number three reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi complex contain enough plutonium to threaten public health with the possibility of inhalation of airborne plutonium particles…. Plutonium is at its most dangerous when it is inhaled and gets into the lungs. The effect on the human body is to vastly increase the chance of developing fatal cancers.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Reportedly, TEPCO plans don’t call for the removal of the MOX fuel in Unit #3 for another decade or more. <a href="http://nuclear-news.net/2013/06/29/lethal-mox-fuel-to-be-removed-from-fukushima-reactor-no-3-starting-in-2020/" target="_blank">Fuel removal</a> from Units #1, #2, and #3 is complicated by lethal radiation levels at all three reactors, as well as TEPCO’s <a href="http://enenews.com/experts-portion-of-fukushimas-molten-fuel-is-believed-to-have-moved-into-earth-groundwater-contacting-melted-cores-may-have-caused-recent-spike-in-radiation-levels" target="_blank">inability so far to locate</a> the three melted cores with any precision.</p>
<p>There is ample reason to hope that Fukushima, despite the complex of uncontrollable and deteriorating factors, will not get worse, because even the Japanese don’t want that. But there is little reason to expect anything but worsening conditions, slowly or suddenly, for years and years to come. And there is even less reason to expect anyone in authority anywhere to be more than minimally and belatedly truthful about an industry they continue to protect, no matter how many people it damages or kills.</p>
<p>The perfect paradigm of that ruthlessly cynical nuclear mentality is the current Japanese practice of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/30/us-fukushima-workers-idUSBRE9BT00520131230" target="_blank">recruiting homeless people</a> to work at Fukushima in high level radiation areas where someone with something to lose might not be willing to go for minimum wage.</p>

<p align="left">According to a new Washington Post-ABC poll, Barack Obama now ranks among the least popular presidents in the last century. In fact, his approval rating is lower than Bush’s was in his fifth year in office. Obama’s overall approval rating stands at a dismal 43 percent, with a full 55 percent of the public “disapproving of the way he is handling the economy”. The same percentage  of people “disapprove of the way he is handling his job as president”.  Thus, on the two main issues, leadership and the economy, Obama gets <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/polling/postabc-poll-obama-republicans-health-care/2013/12/17/42d46190-66d8-11e3-997b-9213b17dac97_page.html">failing grades</a>.</p>
<p align="left">An even higher percentage of people are upset at the way the president is implementing his signature health care system dubbed “Obamacare”.  When asked “Do you approve or disapprove of the way Obama is handling “implementation of the new health care law?” A full 62% said they disapprove, although I suspect that the anger has less to do with the plan’s “implementation” than it does with the fact that Obamacare is widely seen as a profit-delivery system for the voracious insurance industry.  Notwithstanding the administration’s impressive public relations campaign, a clear majority of people have seen through Obama’s health care ruse and given the program a big thumb’s down.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, Obamacare is just the straw that broke the camel’s back. The list of policy disasters that preceded this latest fiasco is nearly endless,  including everything from blanket pardons for the Wall Street big-wigs who took down the global financial system, to re-upping the Bush tax cuts, to appointing a commission of deficit hawks to slash Social Security and Medicare (Bowles-Simpson), to breaking his word on Gitmo, to reneging on his promise to pass Card Check, to expanding to wars in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, to droning 4-times as many civilians as the homicidal maniac he replaced as president in 2008.</p>
<p align="left">Obama’s treatment of undocumented immigrants has been particularly shocking although the details have been kept out of the media, presumably because the news giants don’t want to expose the Dear Leader as a heartless scoundrel who has no problem separating mothers from their children, locking them up in privately-owned concentration camps and booting them out of the country with nothing more than the shirt on their back.  Check out this blurb which sums up Obama’s “progressive” immigration policy in one paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Obama is on track to deport 3 million immigrants without papers by the end of his second term, more than any other president. George W. Bush deported about 2 million over two terms. Obama will likely hit that mark this month….. The average daily count of immigrants in detention now is about 33,000. In 2001, it was 19,000. In 1994, it was 5,000, according to the Detention Watch Network. Almost all of the detainees and deportees are Latino. True, the population of illegal immigrants has also doubled in that time to more than 11 million. But the detainee and deportee counts have escalated more than twice as fast.</p>
<p align="left">“He could go down as the worst president in history toward immigrants,” said Arturo Carmona, executive director of the liberal activist group <a href="http://presente.org/">Presente.org</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Hooray for the Deporter in Chief! You’re Numero Uno, buddy. You even beat Bush! Is it any wonder why the man’s ratings are in freefall?</p>
<p align="left">All told, Obama has been bad for the economy, bad for civil liberties, bad for minorities,  bad for foreign wars, and bad for health care. He has, however, been a very effective lackey-sock puppet for Wall Street, Big Pharma, the oil magnates, and the other 1% -vermin Kleptocrats who run the country and who will undoubtedly attend his $100,000-per-plate speaking engagements when he finally retires in comfort to some gated community where he’ll work on his memoirs and cash in on his 8 years of faithful service to the racketeer class.</p>
<p align="left">But, let’s face it; no one really gives a rip about “drone attacks in Waziristan” or “hunger strikes in Gitmo”. What they care about is keeping their jobs, paying off their student loans, putting the food on the table or avoiding the fate of next-door-neighbor, Andy, who got his pink slip two months ago and now finds himself living in a cardboard box by the river. That’s what the average working stiff worries about; just scraping by enough to stay out of the homeless shelter.  But it’s getting harder all the time, mainly because everything’s gotten worse under Obama.  It’s crazy. It’s like the whole middle class is being dismantled in a 10-year period. Wages are flat,  jobs are scarce, incomes are dropping like a stone, and everyone’s broke. (Everyone I know, at least.)  Did you know that 76% of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck. Check it out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Roughly three-quarters of Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck, with little to no emergency savings, according to a survey released by <a href="http://bankrate.com/">Bankrate.com</a> Monday.</p>
<p align="left">Fewer than one in four Americans have enough money in their savings account to cover at least six months of expenses, enough to help cushion the blow of a job loss, medical emergency or some other unexpected event, according to the survey of 1,000 adults.</p>
<p align="left">Meanwhile, 50% of those surveyed have less than a three-month cushion and 27% had no savings at all….</p>
<p align="left">Last week, online lender CashNetUSA said 22% of the 1,000 people it recently surveyed had less than $100 in savings to cover an emergency, while 46% had less than $800. After paying debts and taking care of housing, car and child care-related expenses, the respondents said there just isn’t enough money left over for saving more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Savings?!?</p>
<p align="left">Are you kidding me? What’s that? Who do you know that’s able to save money in this economy? Maybe rich uncle Johnny whose lived on canned sardines and Akmak for the last 50 years, but nobody else can live like that. Subtract the rent, the groceries, the doctor bills etc, and there’s barely enough leftover to fill the tank to get to work on Monday. Saving just isn’t an option, not in the Obamaworld, that is.</p>
<p align="left">Now check this out from Business Insider:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Thousands of Americans aged 55 and older are going back to school and reinventing themselves to get an edge in a difficult labor market, hoping to rebuild retirement nest eggs that were almost destroyed by the recession….</p>
<p align="left">According to the Federal Reserve, household financial assets, which exclude homes, dropped from a peak of $57 trillion in the third quarter of 2007 to just over $49 trillion in the fourth quarter of last year, the latest period for which data is available.</p>
<p align="left">A survey to be released this summer by the Public Policy Institute of AARP, an advocacy group for older Americans, found a quarter of Americans 50 years and older used up all their savings during the 2007-09 recession. About 43 percent of the 5,000 respondents who took part in the survey said their savings had not recovered.” (“Unemployed Baby Boomers Are Getting Hired By Going Back To School”, Business Insider)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Sure they’re going back to work. What do you expect them to do? They’re broke! They got wiped out in Wall Street’s mortgage laundering scam and they’re still behind the eightball five years later. And what’s left of the money they set aside for retirement is yielding a big zilch thanks to the Fed’s zero rate policy which is forcing people back into another decade of penal servitude at minimum wage. That’s why you see so many hunched over graybeards in red vests with “Happy to Serve You” splattered on their chests lugging shopping bags out to the cars for old ladies. Because they’re broke and out of options. Everyone knows someone like this unless, of course, they’re one of the fortunate few who make up the Nobel 1%; aka–The Job Cremators. Then they don’t have to fret about that sort of thing.</p>
<p align="left">Here’s another gem you might not have seen in USA Today a few months back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“Four out of 5 U.S. adults struggle with joblessness, near-poverty or reliance on welfare for at least parts of their lives, a sign of deteriorating economic security and an elusive American dream.</p>
<p align="left">Survey data exclusive to The Associated Press points to an increasingly globalized U.S. economy, the widening gap between rich and poor, and the loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs as reasons for the trend….</p>
<p align="left">Hardship is particularly growing among whites, based on several measures. Pessimism among that racial group about their families’ economic futures has climbed to the highest point since at least 1987. In the most recent AP-GfK poll, 63% of whites called the economy “poor.”</p>
<p align="left">“I think it’s going to get worse,” said Irene Salyers, 52, of Buchanan County, Va., a declining coal region in Appalachia. Married and divorced three times, Salyers now helps run a fruit and vegetable stand with her boyfriend, but it doesn’t generate much income….</p>
<p align="left">Nationwide, the count of America’s poor remains stuck at a record number: 46.2 million, or 15% of the population, due in part to lingering high unemployment following the recession. While poverty rates for blacks and Hispanics are nearly three times higher, by absolute numbers the predominant face of the poor is white…</p>
<p align="left">“Poverty is no longer an issue of ‘them’, it’s an issue of ‘us’,” says Mark Rank, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who calculated the numbers. “Only when poverty is thought of as a mainstream event, rather than a fringe experience that just affects blacks and Hispanics, can we really begin to build broader support for programs that lift people in need.”  (“4 in 5 in USA face near-poverty, no work”, USA Today)<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/28/americans-poverty-no-work/2594203/"><br />
</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Does Obama have any idea of the damage he’s doing with his Rich-First policies? The country is in a terrible state and yet Obama continues to approve bills that throw millions of people off unemployment benefits, sharply cut government spending, or undermine vital safetynet programs that keep the sick and the elderly from dying on the streets.  It’s like he’s trying to reduce 300 million Americans to grinding third world  poverty in his short eight-year term. Is that the goal?</p>
<p align="left">Did you know that–according to Gallup–20.0% of all Americans did not have enough money to buy food that they or their families needed at some point over the past year? Or that –according to a Feeding America hunger study–more than 37 million people are now using food pantries and soup kitchens? Or that one out of six Americans is now living in poverty which is the highest level since the 1960s? Or that the gap between the rich and poor is greater than any in history?</p>
<p align="left">Everything has gotten worse under Obama. Everything. And, not once, in his five years as president, has this gifted and charismatic leader ever lifted a finger to help the millions of people who supported him, who believed in him, and who voted him into office.</p>
<p align="left">These latest poll results indicate that many of those same people are beginning to wake up and see what Obama is really all about.</p>

<p><span>Adam Smith said governments are &#8220;instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor.&#8221; Wars are waged to make them richer.</span></p>
<p><span>Howard Zinn called war &#8220;terrorism magnified a hundred times.&#8221; Make it many thousands of times.</span></p>
<p><span>Michael Parenti said &#8220;the best way to win a Nobel Peace Prize (is) to wage war or support those who wage (it) instead of peace.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>In his book titled &#8220;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Face-Imperialism-Michael-Parenti/dp/1594519188"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Face of Imperialism</span></span></span></a><span>,&#8221; he discusses a richly financed military/industrial complex. Peter Phillips and Mickey Huff call it the &#8220;military-industrial media complex.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Waging wars requires selling them. Public support is needed. Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky call it &#8220;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-Media/dp/0375714499"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manufacturing Consent</span></span></span></a><span>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Propaganda works as intended. Minds are manipulated to support war. Truth is suppressed. Fear is stoked. Patriotism, national security, and democratic values are highlighted.</span></p>
<p><span>Longstanding US policy facilitates earning obscene amounts from militarism, wars, homeland security, and related operations.</span></p>
<p><span>Doing so has nothing to do with external or internal threats. It&#8217;s unrelated to spreading democracy. It isn&#8217;t about humanitarian intervention.</span></p>
<p><span>It about advancing America&#8217;s imperium. Parenti calls the process &#8220;the most powerful force in world history over the last four or five centuries. (It) &#8220;carves up whole continents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;(T)he dominant politico-economic interests of one nation expropriate for their own enrichment the land, labor, raw materials, and markets of another people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Capitalist imperialism differs from earlier forms. It dominates other economies and political systems. It accumulates enormous amounts of wealth.</span></p>
<p><span>It uses money to make more of it. It gains market control. It exploits resources and labor.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Marx and Engels:</span></p>
<p><span>Bourgeois capital &#8220;chases over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere&#8230;It creates a world after its own image.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Societies are destroyed and remade to do it. Nations are pillaged for profit. Populations become disenfranchised. Workers become serfs. Local cultures become mass-market consumer ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Agribusiness replaces local farming. Competitive industries are eliminated.  Foreign investment crowds out local capital.</span></p>
<p><span>Dominance legitimizes capital&#8217;s divine right. Plunder assures obscene profits. Capital accumulation demands more. Profiteering becomes a be-all-and-end-all.</span></p>
<p><span>Businesses price according to what the market will bear. Profiteers take advantage of emergency or other out-of-ordinary conditions to cash in excessively.</span></p>
<p><span>WikiLeaks calls profiteering &#8220;a pejorative term for the act of making profit by methods considered unethical.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Price fixing is illegal. Price gouging reflects grabbing all you can. It&#8217;s charging more than what&#8217;s considered reasonable and fair.</span></p>
<p><span>War profiteers are in a class by themselves. They thrive on war. They depend on it. Their businesses require conflicts and instability to prosper. The more ongoing, the greater the potential profits.</span></p>
<p><span>Lot of players profit from wars. Companies develop technologies with military applications. Black marketeers cash in.</span></p>
<p><span>Politicians taking campaign contributions, special favors or bribes benefit handsomely. Nations do by acquiring control over territory, resources and exploitable people.</span></p>
<p><span>Private military contractors include companies offering a wide range of services. They provide everything from tactical combat to security to consulting to logistics to technical support.</span></p>
<p><span>In his book titled &#8220;</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Halliburtons-Army-Well-Connected-Company-Revolutionized/dp/1568584431"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Halliburton&#8217;s Army: How a Well-Connected Texas Oil Company Revolutionized the Way America Makes War</span></span></span></a><span>,&#8221; Pratap Chatterjee describes a company tainted by sweetheart deal no-bid contacts, bribes, kickbacks, inefficiency, shoddy work, corruption, fraud, gross overcharging, worker exploitation, and other serious offenses.</span></p>
<p><span>Other companies operate the same way. Military spending is hugely wasteful. Fraud and abuse are rampant. War is extremely profitable. Why else would so many be waged.</span></p>
<p><span>Mercenaries are guns for hire. They&#8217;re for sale to the highest bidder. They&#8217;re in it for the money. They&#8217;re unchecked, unaccountable and unprincipled.</span></p>
<p><span>Arms and munitions companies benefit most. Amounts spent are mind-bogging.</span></p>
<p><span>Bloomberg says defense budgets &#8220;contain hundreds of billions of dollars for new generations of aircraft carriers and stealth fighters, tanks that even the Army says it doesn&#8217;t need and combat vehicles too heavy to maneuver in desert sands or cross most bridges in Asia, Africa, or the Middle East.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>According to BusinessWeek, redundancy wastes lots of money. &#8220;One need only spend 10 minutes walking around the Pentagon or any major military headquarters to see&#8221; it.</span></p>
<p><span>Why doesn&#8217;t Congress trim fat? Because politicians want lots of pork for constituents. It&#8217;s a great vote-getter.</span></p>
<p><span>BusinessWeek explained more, saying:</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Why is sensible military budgeting so difficult? Because lawmakers, including small-government Republicans, protect defense business in their home states with the ferocity of Spartans.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Even if the Pentagon offered up (sensible) cuts&#8230;Congress would almost certainly reject them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The senators and representatives don&#8217;t have the political courage to face voters and tell them that the republic simply does not need the weapon under construction in their hometown.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Trillions of dollars are spent.  Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta once said DOD &#8220;is the only major federal agency that cannot pass an audit today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Even during October&#8217;s 16 day shutdown, huge amounts of wasteful spending continued.</span></p>
<p><span>Ralph Nader calls now the time to address bloated military spending. Let&#8217;s &#8220;start shutting down the waste and fraud in our military budget,&#8221; he stresses.</span></p>
<p><span>Billions get tossed around mindlessly. Profiteers never had it better. Government watchdogs identify hundreds of billions of potential savings from unneeded weapons, defective ones, no-bid excess, overpayments, and outright fraud.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="http://www.sipri.org/"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</span></span></span></a><span> (SIPRI) conducts research on security, war and peace.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;A world in which sources of insecurity are identified and understood, conflicts are prevented or resolved, and peace is sustained,&#8221; it says.</span></p>
<p><span>It reports on &#8220;recent trends in military expenditure(s).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Amounts spent are huge. In 2012, nominal </span><a href="http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=458"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">global military spending</span></span></span></a><span> exceeded $1.7 trillion. It&#8217;s around historic highs.</span></p>
<p><span>In real terms, it exceeds peak amounts spent during the Cold War. Post-9/11, spending increased sharply. America led the way.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2012, </span><a href="http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/Top%2015%20table%202012.pdf"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">15 nations</span></span></span></a><span> accounted for over 80% military spending. SIPRI lists them as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>America: $682 billion &#8211; 39%</span></li>
<li><span>China: $166 billion &#8211; 9.5%</span></li>
<li><span>Russia: $90.7 billion &#8211; 5.2%</span></li>
<li><span>Britain: $60.8 billion &#8211; 3.5%</span></li>
<li><span>Japan: 59.3 billion &#8211; 3.4%</span></li>
<li><span>France: $58.9 billion &#8211; 3.4%</span></li>
<li><span>Saudi Arabia: $56.7 billion &#8211; 3.2%</span></li>
<li><span>India: $46.1 billion &#8211; 2.6%</span></li>
<li><span>Germany: $45.8 billion &#8211; 2.6%</span></li>
<li><span>Italy: $34 billion &#8211; 1.9%</span></li>
<li><span>Brazil: $33.1 billion &#8211; 1.9%</span></li>
<li><span>South Korea: $31.7 billion &#8211; 1.8%</span></li>
<li><span>Australia: $26.2 billion &#8211; 1.5%</span></li>
<li><span>Canada: $22.5 billion &#8211; 1.3%</span></li>
<li><span>Turkey: $18.2 billion &#8211; 1%</span></li>
<li><span>Others 18%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>SIPRI calculates nominal military spending. Amounts America spends far exceeds annual defense authorizations.</span></p>
<p><span>Other allocations are for the Energy Department, State Department, Department of Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, Treasury, NASA, military construction, various categories related to security, and interest attributable to past defense outlays.</span></p>
<p><span>Black intelligence, Pentagon and other budgets add many tens of billions more. So do supplemental military allocations. Foreign aid is mostly military related.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/fullpage/top-10-us-foreign-aid-recipients-17534761"><span style="color: #103cc0;"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Library of Congress</span></span></span></a><span> listed the top 10 2012 recipients and amounts as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>Israel: $3.075 billion</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Israel gets special benefits provided no other nations.</span></p>
<p><span>They include annual $3 billion + direct appropriations, undisclosed additional amounts, state-of-the-art weapons and technology, billions in loan guarantees, military loans as grants, privileged contracts for Israeli companies, trade exemptions, and more.</span></p>
<p><span>Special allocations are buried in various agency budgets. Low or no-interest loans are provided. Some are never repaid. Most often, whatever Israel wants it gets.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Afghanistan: $2.327 billion</span></li>
<li><span>Pakistan: $2.102 billion</span></li>
<li><span>Iraq: $1.683 billion</span></li>
<li><span>Egypt: $1.557 billion</span></li>
<li><span>Jordan: $676 million</span></li>
<li><span>Kenya: $652 million</span></li>
<li><span>Nigeria: $625 million</span></li>
<li><span>Ethiopia: $580 million</span></li>
<li><span>Tanzania: $531 million</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>US defense related spending exceeds $1.5 trillion annually. It&#8217;s half or more what other nations spend in total.</span></p>
<p><span>Militarism defines America. So do permanent wars. They&#8217;re a national addiction. They&#8217;re part of the national culture.</span></p>
<p><span>Violence is the American way. Wars are glorified. Pacifism is considered sissy. Peace is deplored. Conflicts persist with no end.</span></p>
<p><span>War profiteers gorge themselves at the public trough. Their operations thrive on war. They depend on it.</span></p>
<p><span>They&#8217;re waged for profit and dominance. They continue without end. Peace is verboten. It&#8217;s a convenient illusion.</span></p>
<p><span>Howard Zinn once asked &#8220;(h)ow can you have a war on terrorism when war itself is terrorism?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;There is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Why most Americans put up with it they&#8217;ll have to explain. Doing so lets Washington get away with mass murder and then some. It lets war profiteers benefit at our expense.</span></p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/SheriffFinch3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/SheriffFinch2.jpg" align="left" /></a>I realize it is hard for some people to understand (especially those holding political office), but in the United States, “We the People” are the sovereigns. America has no king. In America, “We the People” are Caesar. Someone rightly said, “In America, the people rule; they have the power of the ballot box, the jury box, and the cartridge box.” Amen. And in this land of liberty, nothing is more important than the jury box. The right to a speedy trial by a jury of one’s peers is a benchmark principle of a free land.</p>
<p>Juries have immeasurable power. Not only do they have power over the fate of the accused, they have power over the accusers. No one has more authority than a jury&#8211;not even the judge. And without hyperbole I can say that a constitutionally literate, fully informed jury is pretty much all that stands between the ballot box and the cartridge box.</p>
<p>In a letter to Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “I consider [trial by jury] as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.” And two years before the first musket shot was fired that started America’s War for Independence, a Boston lawyer by the name of John Adams said, “Representative government and trial by jury are the heart and lungs of liberty. Without them we have no other fortification against being ridden like horses, fleeced like sheep, worked like cattle, and fed and clothed like swine and hounds.”</p>
<p>All of the rhetoric of modern judges notwithstanding, juries have a constitutional duty and obligation to judge, not only the merits of the case before them, but also the merits of the law which brought the accused before them. And America’s Founding Fathers agree with what I just said.</p>
<p>John Adams said, “It is not only his [the juror’s] right, but his duty…to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, and conscience, though in direct opposition to the direction of the court.” Again, this is from one of our country’s most celebrated attorneys, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and America’s second President. America’s first Supreme Court Chief Justice agreed with Adams. John Jay wrote, “The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy.”</p>
<p>The rest of America’s founders agreed with Adams, Jay, and Jefferson. US Supreme Court Justice and signer of the Declaration, Samuel Chase, wrote, “The jury has the right to determine both the law and the facts.” Patrick Henry said, “Why do we love this trial by jury? Because it prevents the hand of oppression from cutting you off…This gives me comfort, that, as long as I have existence, my neighbors will protect me.”</p>
<p>Protect its neighbors is exactly what a jury in Liberty County, Florida, recently did. The neighbor in the case was none other than the county sheriff, Nick Finch. Infowars.com covers the story:</p>
<p>“Nick Finch, the Florida sheriff arrested in June after he defended the Second Amendment, has been declared ‘not guilty’ of the charges brought against him by the State of Florida, according to [former Graham County, Arizona, Sheriff] Richard Mack.</p>
<p>“The Liberty Co. sheriff was charged with felony ‘official misconduct’ and ‘falsifying public records’ after he released a suspect arrested on an unconstitutional gun charge and removed the arrest file.</p>
<p>“After closing arguments by prosecutors and the defense, the jury took less than 90 minutes to reach its verdict.”</p>
<p>The report continues saying, “During the trial, the sheriff testified that he released Floyd Eugene Parrish, who was arrested for unlawfully carrying a firearm, because he believed the Second Amendment trumped all state gun laws.</p>
<p>“As we reported back in June, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement accused Finch of covering up the arrest of Floyd Eugene Parrish after releasing him from the Liberty County Jail.</p>
<p>“On March 8, Sgt. James Joseph Hoagland of the Liberty County Sheriff’s Office arrested Parrish during a traffic stop after finding a .25 automatic pistol in Parrish’s right front pocket and a holstered revolver in his car, according to court records.</p>
<p>“Parrish was then taken to the county jail.</p>
<p>“After being notified of Parrish’s arrest, Finch took the arrest file and told jailers that Parrish would be released with no charges, according to investigators.</p>
<p>“Finch also ordered both the pistol and revolver be returned.”</p>
<p>See the report here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infowars.com%2Fsheriff-arrested-charged-after-defending-second-amendment-found-not-guilty%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE305S-a6QMjVjc3pPpCeSilt3Wmg" target="_blank">Pro-Gun Sheriff Found Not Guilty</a></p>
<p>This verdict is one of the most important jury decisions in modern history; and how many reports did you see about it in the mainstream media? Where was ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, or FOX News?</p>
<p>Sheriff Finch is a modern-day Daniel. He stood for his principles, the Constitution, and the liberties of the people of his county; and he was thrown into a den of lions by Republican Governor Rick Scott and the FDLE (Florida Department of Law Enforcement). But an eight-person jury acquitted him of all charges and the sheriff was reinstated.</p>
<p>This is what a jury is supposed to do: protect its neighbors from the oppression of unlawful government. And that is exactly what that Liberty County jury did. They deserve the gratitude of liberty-loving people all over the United States.</p>
<p>It is pathetic and sad that Governor Scott did not stand with Sheriff Finch as he should have done. Scott threw this modern-day Daniel into the lion’s den, but God delivered him. Now the people of Florida should throw Governor Scott into the lion’s den (as King Darius did to Daniel’s accusers) by impeachment and removal from office for not defending the US Constitution, as he took an oath to do. I guarantee you that Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Samuel Chase, and John Jay would have stood with Sheriff Finch. And so would US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Justice Holmes said, “The jury has the power to bring a verdict in the teeth of both law and fact.”</p>
<p>And bringing “a verdict in the teeth of both law and fact” is exactly what a Liberty County, Florida, jury did. They upheld the constitutional right of people to keep and bear arms, and they repudiated the Florida State gun-control laws that abridge that right under the rubric of license.</p>
<p>In truth, every law-abiding citizen in this country has a right under the US Constitution to carry his or her arms&#8211;concealed or open. It is past time for county sheriffs, State governors, and local juries to follow the example of Sheriff Finch and this Liberty County, Florida, jury. It is time for freedom-loving people in all 50 states to demand that these copious State and local gun-control laws that prohibit or restrict the right of the people to keep AND BEAR arms be expunged. That means, if you are called upon to serve on a jury in a case involving a law that restricts the Second Amendment right to freely keep and bear arms, you should do what this Liberty County, Florida, jury did and acquit the accused.</p>
<p>All over America, sheriffs and governors pretend to be supporters of the Constitution. All over America, sheriffs and governors give lip service to the Second Amendment. It is time the American people start demanding more than lip service from their elected officials. We need sheriffs like Nick Finch. And we need governors like…well, like PATRICK HENRY. (Sadly, I can’t think of a single governor today to use as an example.)</p>
<p>Patrick Henry said he depended on his neighbors, when sitting as a jury, to protect him. Happily, Sheriff Finch has some good neighbors. But in truth, juries do more than protect individuals; they protect liberty itself.  Any law that infringes on or contradicts the Bill of Rights should be considered null and void by any citizen-jury. In this way, it is the citizen-jury, not the Supreme Court, which is the final arbiter of a law’s constitutionality. Without the veto power of the jury (call it nullification, if you will), America is not a country of, by, and for the People: but a country of, by, and for the politicians and judges.</p>

<p>The demonization of free thinking individuals is about to begin. By branding Paul Ciancia a conspiracy theorist, all of us will come under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Anyone who does not believe wholeheartedly in the crap the government tries to feed them on a daily basis will become a danger to society.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that after a major public incidence of violence such as mass shootings or bombings, people want answers. It’s right and proper that these cases are investigated and as many answers as possible are provided to the citizens of this country.</p>
<p>Having said that, an alarming pattern is emerging.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Some events are highlighted and get massive coverage on television, on the Internet and in the newspapers, but most incidents do not.</p>
<p>Those that can’t be ‘spun’ by the government are given a couple of lines in the papers or a minute of airtime, and that’s it. Done. Gone. Forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>The events that can be used by the government, get acres of print space and constant news coverage. In addition they always have a reason behind them that benefits the government in some way.</strong></p>
<p>Let me show you what I mean. In 2012 88 people were killed in mass shootings in the United States. Sixteen mass shootings with 88 deaths.(<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/171774/sixteen-us-mass-shootings-happened-2012-leaving-least-88-dead" target="_blank">source</a>) Here’s the list:</p>

<p><strong>December 14, 2012</strong>: One man, and possibly more, murders a reported twenty-six people at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, including twenty children, before killing himself.</p>

There are other cases that in total killed over 30 people (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/17/mass-shootings-us_n_3935978.html" target="_blank">source</a>) but they didn’t have the required ‘spin’ factor so they have not stayed in the news.</p>
<p>All the cases that have made it big, news wise, have had a message from the government to us. These cases were chosen by the government to highlight the need for <strong>more gun control, more surveillance and tighter security. I believe that the ‘evidence’ for these events was tailored.</strong> Tailored to suit the government&#8217;s needs at the time. To give the public a reason for the measures that will be imposed to ‘solve’ the problem. It was spun and nipped and tucked and most likely bears no resemblance to the original reasons behind the act.</p>
<p>With the LAX shooting they have gone a step further. In addition to once again raising the issue of privately owned assault rifles, they have put terms like ‘New World Order’ and ‘fiat currency’ into the wider public domain.</p>
<p><strong>They are pre-conditioning the wider public in subjects usually confined to alternative media.</strong>The average Joe on the street is not familiar with these terms. But now <strong>the government itself has introduced them. They have publicly acknowledged them and linked them to the term ‘conspiracy theorist’.</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1162894/la-airport-gunman-may-face-death-penalty" target="_blank">Sky News US:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A note allegedly found in the suspect’s bag said that he wanted to kill at least one transport officer with his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and didn’t care which one.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Black, white, yellow, brown, I don’t discriminate,” the note read, according to a paraphrase by a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>The suspect’s screed also mentioned “fiat currency” and “NWO,” possible references to the New World Order, a conspiracy theory that foresees a one-world government. </strong>(emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>I will bet my last dollar that in the very near future alternative media will be mentioned. Alternative media sites will be accused of spreading these messages.</p>
<p>We, the alternative media, both writers and readers are next on the list to be demonized. We are the next ‘issue’ that the government needs to find a solution to. Like gun control et al, we have become a target.</p>
<p>The government knows that the alternative media is growing. That more and more people are looking for answers that the mainstream does not provide. This cannot be allowed. It is dangerous to a government that sees itself as omnipotent.</p>
<p>The ‘revelations’ that will come out over the next few days will most likely say that Paul Ciancia frequented alternative media websites and that these sites had a bearing on his actions.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when a man with a gun is just insane, vindictive or just plain bad and decides to shoot people. Now there always has to be a reason, and that reason always has to be one that will allow the government to ride in and rescue us.</p>
<p>It will always be a reason that gives them justification for exercising more control over our lives and this time the reason could well be us, the alternative media.</p>

<p>Torture, or what our government calls “enhanced interrogation”, is not a tactic so much as a darkly artistic process.  The subject of this process has something that the torturer wants; it might be information, or a forced confession to a crime the subject did not commit, but most often, torture is designed to gain nothing more than psychological compliance.</p>
<p>The goal is to manipulate the subject into believing that submission is the only possible future, and that such submission is inevitable regardless of the will of the victim.  The torturer often builds himself up as a kind of parent figure for the subject – becoming the only entity that can supply shelter, water, food, and comfort.  The torturer is taskmaster and abuser, but also caregiver in the twisted relationship dynamic.  A schizophrenic balance is struck in which the subject longs for the outside world and a return to the pleasures of the past (making him desperate and malleable), but he also partially accepts his prison walls as home (giving him a false faith that compliance will lead to a safer and more predictable tomorrow).</p>
<p>Until this compliance is achieved, the subject is exposed to endless and erratic crisis events in which his body is damaged, his mind is deprived of sense, perception, and sleep, and his life is overtly threatened.  He may receive brief moments of rest, but these are designed only to make the next torture session even more raw and painful.  If the subject does not understand how the process works, or if he doesn&#8217;t have a strong sense of his own identity, then he will quickly lose track of reality.  Every moment becomes a waking nightmare, a warped and gruesome carnival, and life becomes nothing more than an absurd and obscure experiment barely worth living.</p>
<p>It is my belief based on substantial evidence that America, as a nation and a culture, is now being held hostage and tortured into submission on a grand scale using economic terror by the elitist establishment which dominates BOTH major political parties.  The goal?  To push our society to conform completely with the concepts of globalization, bureaucratic micro-management, and greatly reduced living standards.  We are being conditioned to accept defeat and failure, and like children, to cry out for a parental authority to save us in our state of helplessness and fear, even if that authority was the cause of our fear from the very beginning.</p>
<p><strong>The Thin Thread Of The American Economic Fantasy</strong></p>
<p>In the past three months the U.S. has flirted with total fiscal collapse three times.  The first event came in August with market rumors that the Federal Reserve was nearing a “consensus” on plans to cut QE stimulus measures, causing panic amongst investors who now realize that the ONLY pillar still holding our fiscal edifice together is endless fiat currency creation by the Fed.  Markets began a paradigm which is now the “new normal”; plummeting whenever good economic news hits the mainstream on the fear that the central bank will tighten policy, and skyrocketing when bad economic news hits the mainstream on the assumption that the Fed will continue printing.  It is official &#8211; lackluster employment reports are something to cheer, and overall systemic crisis is good for stocks:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/22/us-usa-economy-idUSBRE99L04G20131022">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/22/us-usa-economy-idUSBRE99L04G20131022</a></p>
<p>The possibility of a Fed taper has shown us clearly that any action by the private bank to reduce or remove quantitative easing will result in a market panic and implosion.  If the globalists within the Fed apparatus decide one day soon that they want to bring the U.S. to its knees, destroy the dollar, and introduce a new world reserve currency, they can do it with little more than a word proclaiming QE over, or unsuccessful.  So far, they keep the life support machine running&#8230;</p>
<p>The second event came with the drive by the Obama Administration to turn their covert war in Syria into a full blown invasion.  Despite presumptions by many naysayers that Russia and China wouldn&#8217;t lift a finger to aid the Assad regime, both nations staunchly opposed action by the U.S. in the region and tensions neared critical mass.  Make no mistake, a WWIII level event could have easily erupted, and some Americans seem to remain oblivious to the danger.</p>
<p>China and Russia maintain vast influence in global markets.  The EU, for instance, is utterly dependent on Russian natural gas exports for their energy needs.  The U.S. economy could be annihilated within weeks by an announcement by China to dump their treasury holdings or the dollar as the world reserve currency.  This is just a taste of the financial risks associated with a new war in the Middle East, and military risks add even more potential calamity.  Anyone who believes that Chinese or Russian views on American political or military behavior “do not matter” is living in a deluded cartoon-land.</p>
<p>The third event came with the recent debt ceiling debate and government shutdown.  One-third of the U.S. population is disturbingly dependent on scraps from the government&#8217;s table, and any mention of cuts to entitlement programs (or social security, which government treats exactly like an entitlement program) causes immediate and militant finger pointing.  Democrats have been especially vicious in their accusations and rhetoric, consistently referring to Constitutional conservatives and “Tea Party” legislators as “extremists”, “traitors”, and even “domestic enemies”:</p>
<p><iframe width="570" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Z-1F3f5PAa4?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I happen to take a slightly different view to a majority of independent analysts in that I believe the establishment is just as likely to push America into deliberate default as it is to push America into infinite debt and inflationary collapse.  The end result will be exactly the same regardless of the path taken, and we have yet another opportunity to dance on the edge of oblivion coming in three to four months when the debt debate starts all over again.</p>
<p>The point is, our financial system has become so unbalanced and internally diseased that if ANY event follows through to culmination, whether political, economic, or international, the economy WILL shatter.  The past three month are a resounding testament to this fact.<br />
<strong><br />
The “De-Americanization&#8217; Of The Global Economy</strong></p>
<p>In my article &#8216;How The Dollar Will Be Replaced&#8217;, published in 2012, I summarized the Catch-22 nature of America&#8217;s debt problem which I have been warning about since 2006, and how this will eventually end in the abandonment of the dollar as the world reserve currency.  To this day, and in the face of overwhelming evidence that the dollar is doomed, some people still refuse to grasp reality.</p>
<p>In the midst of the latest debt debate China has made clear it&#8217;s intentions through state run media to end its relationship with the greenback, not just to form a Chinese-centric reserve currency system, but a global currency system centered on a “new world order”:</p>
<p><a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2013-10/13/c_132794246.htm">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/indepth/2013-10/13/c_132794246.htm</a></p>
<p>Last year China surpassed the U.S. as the world&#8217;s largest importer and exporter, making its currency, the Yuan, more desirable than the greenback as a reserve in the long term.  Since 2010, China has been quietly but quickly establishing multiple bilateral trade agreements with numerous countries dropping the dollar as the primary purchasing mechanism.  China has accumulated massive gold stores and is set to become the world&#8217;s largest holder of gold in the next two years.  In the past year, China has also surpassed the U.S. as the number one importer of oil, making it a more valued market for the Middle East and causing many to question the dollar&#8217;s relevance as the petro-currency:<br />
<a href="http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-is-Now-the-Worlds-Largest-Importer-of-OilWhat-Next.html"></p>
<p>http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-is-Now-the-Worlds-Largest-Importer-of-OilWhat-Next.html</a></p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, America&#8217;s primary ally and foothold in the global oil market, is now openly calling for an end to traditional agreements and a separation from the U.S. because of the lack of military action in Syria.  This too does not bode well for the dollar&#8217;s petro-status.  Like a chess maneuver, it would seem we have been cornered by the globalists on oil.  If we invade Syria or Iran we risk losing petro-status.  If we do not invade Syria or Iran, we still risk losing petro-status:<br />
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/22/us-saudi-usa-idUSBRE99L0K120131022"></p>
<p>http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/22/us-saudi-usa-idUSBRE99L0K120131022 </a></p>
<p>In response to the dismal debt ceiling extension and the uncertainty underlying the new debate coming in the next few months, China&#8217;s ratings agency, Dagong, has downgraded U.S. treasury bonds yet again:</p>
<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/17/news/economy/debt-ceiling-deal-china/">http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/17/news/economy/debt-ceiling-deal-china/</a></p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries are now witnessing the lowest foreign demand since 2001:<br />
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-20/treasuries-losing-cachet-with-weakest-foreign-demand-since-2001.html?cmpid=yhoo"></p>
<p>http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-20/treasuries-losing-cachet-with-weakest-foreign-demand-since-2001.html?cmpid=yhoo</a></p>
<p>Three near-crisis events in only three months have signaled a severe acceleration in what the Chinese call the “de-Americanization” of the global economy.  All of the financial shifts taking place since the derivatives implosion of 2008, as well as those rushing like white-water rapids through the global system in the wake of the debt ceiling debate, are gravitating towards ONE outcome – the destruction of the dollar, and the introduction of a new global currency (the SDR) controlled the the IMF.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s Vladimir Putin has called for a global currency run by the IMF to replace the dollar:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/SJhB">http://archive.is/SJhB</a></p>
<p>China has called for a global currency run by the IMF to replace the dollar:</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7168919">http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7168919</a></p>
<p>Elitists within the U.S. have called for a global currency run by the IMF to replace the Dollar:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBO34qcnoqM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBO34qcnoqM</a></p>
<p>Hell, even the Vatican has called for a global currency run by a “global public authority” to replace the dollar:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/pontifical-council-for-justice-and-peace-on-the-global-economy">http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/pontifical-council-for-justice-and-peace-on-the-global-economy</a></p>
<p>There is a world-wide strategy in motion to end the dollar, and with it, America as we know it today. The only question is, how many more near-disasters will we have to experience before the trigger event takes place?</p>
<p><strong>The Torture Continues</strong></p>
<p>With so many near misses culminating so close together, it may be wise to consider what could happen in the the next three months while we wait for debt debate theater part duex.  Like a prisoner in Abu Ghraib, America is trapped, waiting for the next humiliation, the next degradation, or the next session of pain.  Are we merely being acclimated to the idea of incessant crisis?  Are we learning to become apathetic at the edge of the chasm?  Or, are we being driven to madness, mass-madness, by a concert of  elitist interrogators seeking our acquiescence?</p>
<p>Again, the central purpose of torture is to acquire consent.  Not just extorted consent, but voluntary consent.  It is not enough for the torturer to force the subject to obey, he wants the subject to EMBRACE his servitude.  To gladly abandon all hope.  To see his captor as his only salvation.</p>
<p>The globalist establishment wants us to beg them to save us from the tortures they create.  If we never give them this, they will never win.</p>
