<p>In a post-modernism age the most assertive and self-proclaimed worshipers in the supremacy of science, have no room for a belief in God. These arrogant elites treat anyone, who profess that a true understanding of science does not contradict the presence of the almighty, with condescending distain for refusing to accept that God is dead. The <a href="http://batr.org/solitary/082411.html">transhumanist</a> insistence that they will emerge as supreme beings is the pivotal sacrilege that underpins the social culture and political chaos that leads to the ultimate destruction of the species. Extinction of the human race and the invention of an artificial deity, denies that the act of creation inherently is the prowess of the All Powerful.</p>
<p>Sophomoric intelligence based upon pretentious and conceited self-regard is actually immature and ill-informed sense of worth and understanding. The reason for the absurdity, which is the hallmark of societal dysfunction, stems from the malevolent masterminds NWO globalist plan and carried out by their technocrat minions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/48746642/8/THE-MATTOID-SYNDROME">The Most Secret Science by Archibald E Roberts</a> examines the MATTOID SYNDROME in chapter twelve. &#8220;Irrational political decisions at policy-making levels force upon perceptive Americans the conclusion that an invisible government of men &#8220;unbridled by logic or understanding&#8221; has acquired ultimate power and influence in the United States. Furthermore, the image-building manipulations of these Mattoids favor the development of similar attitudes in others and give thousands—perhaps millions—of normally well-balanced persons the courage to overtly engage in absurd or infamous acts.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Roberts/lcite_note-6">Colonel Archibald E. Roberts</a> championed his views several decades ago. Yet, his analysis has not lost any of the impact or importance as the 21th century unfolds. Essentially, the situation is a geometric progression as the delusion worsens.</p>
<p>Scientists once relied upon empirical evidence and followed the <a href="http://teacher.nsrl.rochester.edu/phy_labs/appendixe/appendixe.html">four steps of the scientific method</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Observation and description of a phenomenon or group of phenomena.</li>
<li>Formulation of a hypothesis to explain the phenomena. In physics, the hypothesis often takes the form of a causal mechanism or a mathematical relation.</li>
<li>Use of the hypothesis to predict the existence of other phenomena, or to predict quantitatively the results of new observations.</li>
<li>Performance of experimental tests of the predictions by several independent experimenters and properly performed experiments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current credibility of the academic community is suspect as government funding and peer pressure for career advancement demands conformity to promote specific political agendas. No area of science is more tainted than the study of global climate. In the <a href="http://usnewsghost.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/ipcc-falsifying-climate-change-science-fraud-reports-exposed-co2-global-warming-recent/">New Report, IPCC Falsifying Climate Science, New Fraud Reports Exposed, CO2</a> illustrates the politicization of science and the betrayal of their own methodology standards.</p>
<p>Inexhaustible debate on the global warming hypothesis has developed bitter contention because conclusions much be tailored to advance the globalist hysteria that is seen as necessary to maintain the <a href="http://batr.org/view_/111401.html">New World Disorder Psychology</a>. Wacko environmentalists share an extreme similarity with their scientist gurus who mock divine intervention and profess that man has all the knowledge necessary to become masters of the universe.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Secular Humanism, has become, the leading export of the &#8216;West&#8217; to the rest of the world. The movers and shakers of public policy accept its values, cosmology, as Sigmund Freud views that reason rules, and that a rejection of God is acceptable. Religion is seen as a threat, and that life can be lived without delusions, especially the illusion of a religious belief. His theory of human nature and the culture of morality is founded upon the substitute of the super-ego, for the role of religion. As the source of morality and conscience, man is able to apply his reason to follow ethical behavior.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the end, all the <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/010103.html">HAARP</a> manipulations and chemtrail spraying cannot and will not achieve domination over the planet. Relying on <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/020503.html">NASA</a> to discover nirvana or trusting Japanese scientists to resolve a Fukushima nuclear winter is no better than following <a href="http://www.ecopedia.com/lifestyle/10-celebrities-taking-action-global-warming/">celebrity</a> global warming advocates into the vast void of their own mental space.</p>
<p>However, the stakes become critical, when purported distinguished scientific institutes, fall into the trap of anti-intellectual conduct. The <a href="http://notrickszone.com/2014/02/20/prestigious-helmholtz-research-association-gutter-dives-promotes-attacks-on-skeptics-labelling-them-deniers/">Prestigious Helmholtz Research Center</a> Gutter-Dives…Promotes Sophomoric Attacks On Skeptics, Labelling Them &#8220;Deniers&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s worrisome enough that the German government itself recently issued a <a href="http://notrickszone.com/2013/05/16/german-ministry-of-environment-identifies-targets-american-and-german-enemy-skeptics-in-123-page-pamphlet/">brochure</a> singling out, naming, and defaming German and American climate science skeptics. Today we have one of Germany’s most prestigious science associations actively backing adolescent-level attacks on skeptics who have decided not to take part in the collective climate hysteria.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seeking remission for fabricated crisis, like the newly renamed <a href="http://www.scientific-alliance.org/scientific-alliance-newsletter/global-warming-global-climate-disruption">climate disruption</a>, plays to the mental illness of fools who demand that saving the planet requires that they bury any semblance of religious belief and repentance. According to such enlighten cretins; absolution is not necessary, since acknowledging a creator would make their Frankenstein genetic engineering and eugenics experiments unholy.</p>
<p>Proponents of deceptive discourse would have you believe that <a href="http://lclane2.net/soph.html">sophomoric</a> <a href="http://lclane2.net/rationalizing.html">reasoning</a> is rationalizing about what one understands poorly. It is often <a href="http://lclane2.net/apologetics.html">apologetics</a> (starting with a conclusion) and masquerades as &#8220;<a href="http://lclane2.net/critical.html">critical thinking</a>&#8220;. Sound good on the surface, but when you probe closely the real bias of the position becomes obvious.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Science begins with hypotheses; apologetics begins with conclusions. Science performs experiments which can disconfirm hypotheses; apologetics employs rhetoric (conclusions can never be disconfirmed). Science discovers how the world works; Christian apologetics assures that the world conforms to the Bible (or to church doctrine). Apologetics is not a productive approach to discovering how the world works; science is not a productive method for making the world conform to the Bible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The last point divulges the basic disconnect. Belief in the Bible is an existential decision. Inquiry in the way the world operates is not reducible to merely running technological experimentation. Dismissing the significance and value of accepting faith in a revealed Creator is the usual determination to the scientific trained mind. Yet the objection to investigate the validity for acceptance of a divine plan for the salvation of souls permeates the man-centered culture of Modern Prometheus inquiry.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/.pond/feargod.jpg.w300h205.jpg" alt="feargod.jpg" width="300" align="Left" /></p>
<p>The function of science is to question, but the methods of science are not synonymous with scholarship. The burden of proof that an agnostic or atheistic conviction is a requirement for conducting good science is a research project that most universities will avoid. Nevertheless, membership of good standing into the scientific community undoubtedly rests upon this canon of doctrine.</p>
<p>It seems to be puerile to demand blindness to the universal evident, that the cosmos provides. Benjamin Cain critique of <a href="http://rantswithintheundeadgod.blogspot.com/2013/01/stephen-hawkings-scientific-atheism.html">Stephen Hawking’s Scientific Atheism</a> philosophy concludes it is absurdly anti-philosophical, so he is forced to pretend that his atheism is purely scientific.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Here is Hawking’s stripped-down argument for God’s nonexistence: the universe was created in the Big Bang, which means that in its earliest stage the universe was infinitesimal and so the laws of quantum mechanics apply to its origin, and we know from those laws that quantum events can happen spontaneously without any cause; moreover, the Big Bang’s gravitational singularity was in effect a black hole and we know that in modern-day black holes time stops inside of them, which means there was no time before the Big Bang and thus no time for anyone to create the universe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Cain continues, &#8220;atheists presuppose a religion in their effort to unite naturalism with their typical liberal values: this religion is secular humanism, Scientism, positivism, or pragmatism. But when a religion is only presupposed rather than openly acknowledged, the religion is bound to be clumsy and lackluster, and that’s the case with Hawking’s atheistic argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking the &#8220;Political Incorrect&#8221; cult of religion to the extreme, the example of Lawrence Torcello &#8211; assistant professor of philosophy at Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, writes in an essay at <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/03/13/US-Philosophy-Professor-Jail-Denialist-Climate-Scientists-For-Criminal-Negligence">The Conversation</a> that climate scientists who fail to communicate the correct message about &#8220;global warming&#8221; should face trial for &#8220;criminal negligence&#8221;. How advance civilization has become under the scientific inquisition.Absolution by compurgation testimony of your peers may become necessary for acquittal. Under the new standard of scientific rule, even the &#8220;PC&#8221; philosopher must adopt the dogma of the Galileo court. How radical the tables have turned now that we know that the earth is round and rotates around the sophomoric society.</p>
<p>One of the latest targets for political persecution happens to be <a href="http://www.livescience.com/25303-science-vs-god-debate.html">Dinesh D&#8217;Souza</a>. During a recent debate on the subject he argued that the two — science and religion — are fundamentally separate.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The questions to which God is the answer are not scientific questions,&#8221; D&#8217;Souza said. Humans around the world want to know <a href="http://www.space.com/16281-big-bang-god-intervention-science.html">why the universe exists</a>, the purpose of our existence and what will come afterward. Science doesn&#8217;t &#8220;have a clue&#8221; as to the answers to these questions, D&#8217;Souza said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking to science for a discovery of salvation is irrational. Achieving <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2048299,00.html">Raymond Kurzweil’s</a> singularity promise of immorality within the artificial intelligence of a new life form species sounds allot like Satan’s sin of pride.While religion has never rendered a redemptive society, faith in God provides the only <a href="http://www.batr.org/hope/">hope</a> in living in a world of the boundless inhumanity of man to his brother. When scientists dismiss the need for forgiveness, their culture of forging enhanced tiers of technology, usually translates into greater levels of human bondage. The real climate disruption comes out of the laboratories of weird science. Adversely altering the natural order of the universe is as simpleminded as you can get.</p>

<p>Something is far beyond contaminated and glow-fishy about the Fukushima meltdown. For two years it has been discussed and swarming with expertise, but with no limiting or actual efforts to stop the radiological contaminants from being released into the Pacific and all other connected oceans, the largest food and oxygen sources on the planet. Yet, surfers are surfing, swimmers are swimming, children are playing on beaches, and restaurants all over the earth are eating Pacific fish and also contaminated Atlantic fish according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>Also never actually disclosed or addressed is that perhaps as many as 1500 nukes have been tested in the world’s oceans, which also might have produced “contamination” since nuclear pollution doesn’t ever really go away. So, at this juncture I ask myself, where is the left hand and what might it be doing? Politics, as we know, has new meaning in the global world of corporate-political elites. Their political intentions were always based in deceptions from the earliest planning stages to today, for one hundred if not two hundred years. The UN Agenda 21 blueprint has never been fully disclosed in truth or in the open.</p>
<p>The 47 U.S. Biosphere Reserves are still completely under the veil for 90% of American people who have still never heard of them; same with the World Heritage Sites, and they are totally in the dark regarding the 620+ global reserves. Stratospheric Aerial Geoengineering and Solar Radiation Management (chemtrailing) are only just now kind of/sort of acknowledged as “possibly” damaging the planet for 35 years or more as well as the super-secret global HAARP facilities, which happen to super-heat the atmosphere, while aerial spraying traps the “warming” on the ground beneath the artificial, metallized, and very noxious and debilitating clouds and haze that laid across the skies, globally. And suddenly, we have another global crisis, publicized, with people sick, dying badly, and with sea life really, really sick and dying, and with worsening news and contamination pouring into the Pacific every day. Instead, a handful of “experts” are studying, having meetings and press conferences, pondering, coordinating thoughts and ideas, kicking the dirt, etc., etc. What we are witnessing is political theater.</p>
<p>The problem is we, too, are getting sicker and sicker. Fukushima is, after all, not just an oceanic problem. Radioactive ocean water evaporates and rains down…on everything…over the entire planet, and it just so happens that the nano-particulates of aluminum, barium, strontium and other concoctions sprayed from jets and commercial planes, globally, also rain down, blow in the wind…nano-sized mind you…which means their ingredients are wholly and completely unavoidable. Even your N95 masks, coats, gloves, hats and safety glasses cannot protect you, and these nano-particles are in your homes, your cars, all over your children, stores, pets, possessions, lawns, trees, forests, in all watershed systems, and all over the nation and world’s crop fields (think Monsanto “aluminum resistant” seeds). Consider well the over 1400 global seed vaults.</p>
<p>I fear we are experiencing a double-whammy. I am also thinking that a “global” crisis or crises are forthcoming, which will put “global” power centers front and center and in full-force all over the entire world. I equally think that global health may be collapsing as we speak, as global nature is demonstrating. Billions of fish and sea creatures dying, billions of birds, hundreds of trillions of insects and amphibians, and even large sea and forest mammals, far larger than human beings, are dying all around the world…and badly.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of forested acres are burning, annually and globally, while global aquifers are being privatized and locked down from most of humanity. Depopulation was always part and parcel of the original plan by globalism’s authors, and certainly a mass die-off of humanity cannot appear as genocide or democide in a mass-media whistleblowing world, not when the orchestrators are so terribly few, but a left-right punch from global catastrophic “events”, especially ones we choose to ignore with our best ignorance, could be our undoing. When we choose to ignore Fukushima and allow governments to ignore mass-extinction “events”, and when we steadfastly refuse to acknowledge that we are sprayed like insects for 35+ years, seeing it above our heads for days and weeks on end, because we “don’t want to think about it,” well…maybe we prove what elites have always believed, that we are “useless”, “ignorant”, “costly”, and “too common” for their many bottom lines. As history has demonstrated century after century after century, when there are too many poor people, human culling occurs, which means they are murdered.</p>
<p>I fear history, once again, is upon us. When whales, dolphins, deer and trillions of other animals and mammals and plants are biting the dust and all at the same time, we’re next…especially because we eat these plants and animals, actually resulting in a third-whammy to humankind. Truth is, folks, we are being in-toxic-acted from every direction humanly possible. What is happening to the world is not an accident. We are getting hit from all angles.</p>

			<p>For the past few weeks, word of the extent of the Fukushima disaster is spreading like the radiation slick moving across the Pacific Ocean thanks to social media and a lot of newly concerned citizens.</p>
<p>Independent researchers who have been trying to warn people for over a year are finally being heard. Much of that can be attributed to citizen journalists, who have realized mainstream media dropped the ball on this a long time ago.</p>
<p>To understand the dynamics of information and how it has been controlled, you would have to look at companies like General Electric and Westinghouse, who not only build nuclear reactors, but own major news outlets and, of course, are buddy-buddy with the Obama Administration.</p>
<p>Or, I can just tell you about it, since I have spent countless hours researching these connections and interviewing people about it. More on that at a later date. It deserves a nice big page in itself, with room for lots of details.</p>
<p>Not only do we have citizen journalists and the alternative media on top of this, but citizen scientists as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAVSRALX.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="imagesCAVSRALX" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAVSRALX.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="149" /></a>Have you met your new Fukushima expert, who just might live right next door? These are people who have taught themselves everything they possibly could about nuclear physics, radiation, Geiger counters, atomic power, nuclear plants, the effects of radiation on health, and <a href="http://fukushimafacts.com/Default.aspx?PID=47&amp;T=Mitigation%20&amp;%20How%20To%20Protect%20Yourself" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">radiation mitigation</a>.</p>
<p>These citizen scientists have studied bombs, fallout, and weather and wind patterns. They have been monitoring radiation levels across the country, with their own equipment they purchased out of pocket and learned how to use.</p>
<p>They have read anything and everything they can get their hands on. They know the difference between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, and how to avoid it.</p>
<p>They know that besides cancer, radiation can do all kinds of things to you, like severely compromise your immune system, intelligence, and thyroid, or make you aggressive, confused, and fatigued.</p>
<p>You might bruise or bleed in weird places and feel sick more than usual. They have learned all this out of their own instincts of survival.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mk_6_nuclear_bomb.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="mk_6_nuclear_bomb" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mk_6_nuclear_bomb-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="181" /></a>Sometimes they even go 2 days without sleep, when bad stuff is happening, just to make sure they are keeping on top of the issues as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s amazing what you can do in a short period of time when your life depends on it. And the more that they learn, the greater their sense of urgency has become in bringing this info to the masses.</p>
<p>And what conclusion have these citizen journalists and citizen scientists reached throughout 14 months of study?</p>
<p>They have come to the inevitable conclusion that all of our lives changed on March 11, 2011, when Fukushima went out of control.</p>
<p>The glaring problem is that we that we weren’t told about what actually happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs_1000lb_5in.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="bombs_1000lb_5in" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs_1000lb_5in-300x245.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="196" /></a>Take, for instance, the fact that there were 3 meltdowns almost right away, and that the radioactive isotopes that blew all over Japan, Hawaii, Alaska, Canada and North America came in extraordinarily high quantities.</p>
<p>Or how various agencies that taxpayers have funded, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), did not do their job which is to protect the environment, and us.</p>
<p>In fact the EPA turned off their monitors for about a month, for the first time in their history. These are expensive and delicate pieces of equipment the taxpayers had already bought and paid for, for just such an emergency.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) knew, but they hid the information. The Obama Administration knew, but sent Hillary Clinton over to Japan to shake hands with the Prime Minister and show support.</p>
<p>Obama came out with a statement to the American people, saying, “We do not believe harmful levels of radiation will reach our shores,” which we now know was a lie.</p>
<p>We had to figure all this out for ourselves, which was difficult because the information was purposely withheld from us.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts, they can’t stop the truth from leaking out of Fukushima. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have now proven this beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theory is becoming conspiracy fact. And now we are going public with this information, and in a very big way.</p>
<p>It has been around 3 weeks since I wrote <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/04/21/fukushima-is-falling-apart-are-you-ready/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">my first article</a> for <a href="http://endthelie.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">End the Lie</a>, and still no real progress to report at the plant itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B5390716-Fasciation-SPL.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="Fasciation" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B5390716-Fasciation-SPL-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="243" /></a>Tons of water continues to get poured into the reactors and flow subsequently into the Pacific Ocean, every second of every day.</p>
<p>Radiation continues to steam itself out of the ground, and thus up into the air, which then blows over us (i.e. resident of the northern hemisphere).</p>
<p>Earthquakes still happen daily around Japan. In fact there were 7 or 8 of them just in the past few days near Fukushima.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://endthelie.com/2012/05/06/which-will-collapse-first-the-economy-or-the-spent-fuel-pool-at-fukushima/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spent fuel still sits in its shaky nest at the top of reactor number 4</a>. Nothing has been done to further reinforce the structure.</p>
<p>The good news (if you can really call it that) is that it hasn’t fallen yet. The United Nations and the United States are now in their most preliminary stages of addressing the complexity of problems there, in an attempt to see if they can help out.</p>
<p>But as you know, the wheels of bureaucracy turn very slowly. It took almost 14 months for them to start turning at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/smiley-nuclear.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="smiley-nuclear" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/smiley-nuclear-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="185" /></a>Besides the ongoing releases into the ocean and air and the precariousness of the pool, we have a debris field the size of Texas starting to hit the west coast and Alaska, which may or may not be radioactive.</p>
<p>Japan has been burning radioactive trash, and will continue to do so until at least 2014, and that blows over us as well.</p>
<p>We have a radioactive slick moving across the ocean, which by all estimates should have sunk to the bottom, but hasn’t. And we have sick and dying mammals, fish, and birds all over the world, which may or may not be related, but should still be an enormous concern, since many of them are being found in the Pacific.</p>
<p>That is part of the problem when you are faced with the world’s largest disaster. All of the models for how to deal with it can be thrown out the window.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/radiation-umbrella.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="radiation-umbrella" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/radiation-umbrella-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="191" /></a>All the assumptions about fallout and it working itself into the food chain have been wrong. It was much worse, and has happened much faster, than anyone expected, even for concerned citizens and independent researchers following this closely.</p>
<p>The government knew this would be the case from the early SPEEDI numbers, which were hand translated and delivered to the US government as they happened. But for the most part, Fukushima has exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p>
<p>New ideas, new techniques, and new engineering has to be invented and implemented. New observations have to be made, and they are, as can be seen by searching “mutations” on YouTube and watching some videos.</p>
<p>We have citizen journalists and citizen scientists who are desperately trying to come up with solutions, and are doing it for free, while our government and agencies created to “protect us” continue to collect their paycheck, roll their eyes, shove their hands in their pockets and hum a tune like they’re waiting for a taxi.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/page11_obama_nuclear.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="page11_obama_nuclear" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/page11_obama_nuclear-300x249.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="224" /></a>But out of crisis, comes opportunity. I’ll use 9/11 again as an example.</p>
<p>Why do people get a warm fuzzy feeling when we see people rushing to aid those in the midst of disaster? Because we humans are hard-wired to care for others, and long to be part of a community.</p>
<p>Out of disaster, there is camaraderie, sympathy, and empathy. There are important lessons to be learned.</p>
<p>There are whole new industries that could be created out of this crisis, putting people to work. Aquaponics. Decontamination. Mitigation. Food testing.</p>
<p>And since we didn’t seem to learn these lessons with Chernobyl, we need to learn them right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs-away.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="bombs-away" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bombs-away-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" /></a>All nuclear power does is boil water and create steam, which turbines turn into electricity. But when something goes wrong, it has the ability to kill everything on the planet. That is where we are at now.</p>
<p>We need to adapt if we are to survive. And part of that adaptation means we need to eliminate the possibility of this ever happening again, starting with the 23 reactors the same style as Fukushima, in the United States, which is the Mark 1 Boiling Water Reactor, or BWR.</p>
<p>People in the industry jokingly refer to these as “double-decker beach-bombs,” for the reason that the spent fuel is located in pools at the top of the reactor buildings, and they are usually located at a water source for emergency cooling purposes for when the fecal matter hits the fan at one of these plants.</p>
<p>In fact, several nuclear engineers who designed these reactors quit in protest before they went into production. They realized they had made a mistake. They realized this design would be extremely dangerous. GE went ahead and built them anyway.</p>
<p>When is the world going to realize the mistake of embracing nuclear energy as a power source, in spite of its danger?</p>
<p>And how long do we continue to ignore the brilliant scientists that warned about this, like Oppenheimer and Einstein? Or is it already too late?</p>
<div></div>
<p>There are no energy problems, in comparison. If you want to cut down on your electricity usage, turn off your TV.</p>
<p>We have natural gas deposits that could power everything we need. We have the power of the sun, water, wind and earth in the form of geothermal energy.</p>
<p>Nuclear power is a sham, just like the oil industry, and we have been duped into believing we need it to survive.</p>
<p>It generates billions and billions of dollars for these corporations. GE (who has the most ironic motto, “We Bring Good Things to Life”) made 14 billion dollars last year, and paid no taxes.</p>
<p>In addition to producing electricity, nuclear reactors also generate 500 pounds of plutonium a year per reactor, as a byproduct of the fission process.</p>
<p>What happens to all that highly toxic plutonium? The government gets to collect this material to make bombs, so we can go utterly decimate other countries, now known as “spreading democracy” and poison their populations for future generations.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget depleted uranium, or DU, which is now used in many military applications with horrific results.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/iraq-war-child.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="iraq-war-child" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/iraq-war-child-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="164" /></a>Check out videos of children in Fallujah for some recent examples of this.</p>
<p>This is the one big secret that the nuke industry and our government will do anything to protect: besides being a billion dollar industry, nuke plants are basically bomb-making factories right under our noses.</p>
<p>Drawing attention to Fukushima would have drawn attention to this function of nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>An added side effect is that they also make people sick and help boost the health care industry, which in some states is now the number one private sector employer.</p>
<p>The plutonium and fission byproducts these plants produce help support our government’s number-one priority: the almighty military-industrial complex.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAQ3GNQ3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="imagesCAQ3GNQ3" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imagesCAQ3GNQ3.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="164" /></a>And it’s all in the name of money, power, and control. Energy companies hire top level advertisers and public relations people to promote and manipulate public opinion. Even during the Superbowl, ads were run showing how steam from nuclear power runs the turbines that make beer.</p>
<p>They want you to believe that we are dependent on this source of energy for our quality of life. The truth of the matter, on the other hand, is that nuclear power has ruined our lives.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who used to live in the ever-expanding evacuation zone in Japan, which may soon include the 35 million people in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Ask anyone who lives near a nuke plant and has a child with autism, gastroenteritis, or cancer. Just take a look at the statistics of cancer in the general population since we started embracing this technology.</p>
<p>The truth is: we have been nuked and are still getting nuked, every day, in a very big way.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nuke-parade-small.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="nuke-parade-small" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nuke-parade-small-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="179" /></a>I used to be a huge supporter of nuclear power, but 14 months of intensive study has changed my opinion significantly.</p>
<p>In addition to my studies, I have been influenced by some major health issues I developed after being outside the first 3 weeks after the reactors exploded. During that time I had a metallic-taste in my mouth, which I found out later was from tasting fission products. More on that later as well.</p>
<p>Nuclear cheerleaders like to complicate things in an attempt to make radiation something much harder to understand. That way it turns people off from the subject and they won’t pay attention as much.</p>
<p>The truth is, you don’t need to be a physicist, a scientist, or an expert in this field. You don’t need to know the differences between decay rates and half-lives, or cesium and strontium.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/315914_260698387298809_260610960640885_663529_402038659_n-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="180" /></a>You only need to understand one thing: All radiation is bad, and all of it will make you sick, no matter how much Ann Coulter claims that the Japanese should be thankful for Fukushima.</p>
<p>The more you are exposed to it, the sicker you will be. The more places you can cut down on your exposure, the better off your health will be.</p>
<p>Radiation is cumulative. It builds up in the body. It destroys cells. It causes mutations in cell growth which can thus create cancer or other illnesses.</p>
<p>There is plenty of this radiation leaking out of Fukushima for over a year now, blowing around in our air, building up in our soil, and contaminating our water supply.</p>
<p>What’s worse, we have 104 of these plants in the United States, with special emphasis on the 23 previously mentioned, where this exact scenario is waiting to happen.</p>
<div id="attachment_45328"></div>
<p>Radioactive steam comes out of these plants all the time, since as part of their normal operations. They vent to the atmosphere to keep things cool. Do some research into “rainshadow” in autism and brain cancer in children, and look where the numbers are the highest: around nuclear plants.</p>
<p>We can’t afford to wait or delay. If you aren’t already mitigating, you need to start now. You need to treat your health, and the health of your family, like you all have cancer already. That might sound like fear mongering to some, but this is one case where “better safe than sorry” truly applies.</p>
<p>This process involves eating healthy whole foods, filtering water, avoiding precipitation, taking supplements, and getting lots of sleep.</p>
<p>Stop eating fast food, and eat lower on the food chain, where bio-accumulation is less. Stop eating seafood, unless you know it is safe.</p>
<p>Include your children in these changes, because we will be dealing with this problem for at least the rest of our lives, and so will they.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/0809-CNUKE-01-VERT-nuclear-energy-option_full_600-213x300.jpg" alt="" width="213" height="300" /></a>We have to change our perspective. Quality of life becomes a much more important issue when your life expectancy has been shortened.</p>
<p>We have Fukushima to thank for this, and the nuclear industry, of course. As well as the various other individuals or agencies that tried to keep this information from us.</p>
<p>And then of course we have spent fuel pool doom lurking in the shadows. And for some unknown reason, Tepco seems to think their most immediate concern is building a huge underground wall, to contain something going on under the plant, the extent of which hasn’t yet been shared with us.</p>
<p>So what do they know that we don’t? Why is there a sense of urgency to contain something underground, when the spent fuel pool #4 is supposedly the weakest link in the Fukushima chain?</p>
<p>Where is all this technology we have to look for gas and oil, like ground-penetrating radar, optical coherence tomography, or even HAARP, to see what’s going on under the plants? What else is being hidden from us?</p>
<p>Instead of calling it game over, let’s play a new game called “No More Fukushimas.”</p>
<p>Let’s figure out ways to clean up this mess and not make more of them in the future. We can leave this for our children to deal with, that is if they are still here.</p>
<p><a href="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AJ201109069466.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="AJ201109069466" src="http://endthelie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AJ201109069466-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="179" /></a>Or it is up to you, it is up to me, it is up to <strong>all</strong>of us to fix this situation, right now, as best as we possibly can.</p>
<p>Take care of your family first, have a plan for the worst-case scenario, then do what you can to help others.</p>
<p>Our lives all changed over a year ago, only you weren’t told about it. As bad as things are, there is a huge opportunity here for something wonderful to come out of this mess. A cleaner, brighter, healthier future for our children and generations to come. A future, period.</p>
<p>As a close associate of Obama once said, “Never let a crisis go to waste”. This might be the last crisis that we ever see, if we don’t so something about it.</p>

				<p>January 27, 2012 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=13570#respond" title="Comment on PIPA Vote Stalled While US Censorship Still Grows"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="13570 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=13570">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img title="PC 97 2012" src="http://abact.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pc-97-2012.jpg" alt="" />After the world’s most massive online protest on Jan. 18 against two internet censorship bills, which generated over<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/sopa-pipa-indefinitely-shelved-massive-protesting-184900719.html" target="_blank"> 7 million</a> petition signatures, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid postponed the PIPA vote set for the 24th, so that lawmakers could rework the bill.</p>
<p>On January 18, from 8 am to 8 pm Eastern (-5 GMT), some of the most popular websites on the planet blackened their pages in protest of PIPA, or PROTECT IP Act, (<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-968" target="_blank">S. 968</a>: Protect Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property), and SOPA, (<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-3261" target="_blank">HR 3261</a>) the Stop Online Piracy Act.</p>
<p>Though PIPA is hailed as only slightly less bad than SOPA, both threaten free access to information on the web by allowing accusers to shut down an entire website, even shared platforms like Twitter, WordPress and YouTube, because of a single copyright violation. Instead of a civil penalty, the law proposes making copyright violation a felony. Try finding a job in the US with a felony conviction under your belt.</p>
<p>Chris Heald did a <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/17/sopa-dangerous-opinion/" target="_blank">Mashup</a> analysis of SOPA, and explains how advertisers can get out of paying their bills. He adds that “SOPA expands ‘willful infringement’ to include those who don’t understand the law, not just those who understand it and choose to ignore it.”</p>
<p>Google, the world’s most visited website, blocked out its name and provided a link to petition Congress to defeat both bills. By 3pm on the 18th, it had already logged 4 million signatures, reports <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pipa-sopa-co-sponsors-drop-like-flies-120118/" target="_blank">Torrent Freak</a>.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, the world’s 6th most popular website, blacked itself out for 24 hours, leaving a poignant message:</p>
<p>“Imagine a World Without Free Knowledge: For over a decade, we have spent millions of hours building the largest encyclopedia in human history. Right now, the U.S. Congress is considering legislation that could fatally damage the free and open Internet. For 24 hours, to raise awareness, we are blacking out Wikipedia.”</p>
<p>WordPress <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/join-our-censorship-protest/" target="_blank">enabled a feature</a> so that its 40 million blogs could black out their own site, also providing a link to register objection to the bills.</p>
<p><strong>Censorship a growing problem</strong></p>
<p>Mickey Huff, editor of <a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/store/" target="_blank">Project Censored</a>, warns that American reliance on “institutional reform over implementation of revolutionary ideals and actions as tools for change” is allowing the erosion of democracy to continue unabated. Free and easy access to accurate and important information is the cornerstone of any free society. Reform, writes Huff, is only a small part of an effective radical strategy.</p>
<p>One radical tactic employed by Anonymous on Thursday tricked people into aiming its botnet software, known as LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Canon<a href="http://cybercrime.hostzi.com/Ym90bmV0/loic/" target="_blank">)</a>, at the US Dept. of Justice in retaliation for its <a href="http://www.jdjournal.com/2012/01/21/fbi-shuts-down-megaupload-arrests-top-execs/" target="_blank">takedown</a> of file sharing site, Megaupload.com, and arrest of key principals.</p>
<p>For the past 35 years, Project Censored has published an annual collection of the top 25 censored news stories. In the 2012 book edition, my article,<a href="http://coto2.wordpress.com/2010/07/28/case-orange-60-years-of-geoengineering-goes-into-hyperdrive-as-%e2%80%98plan-b%e2%80%99/" target="_blank">Atmospheric Geoengineering: Weather Manipulation, Contrails and Chemtrails</a>, ranks as the 9th most censored story in the United States. <em>PC 2012</em> sites several other independent sources that report on weather manipulation as a weapon of war, mentioning HAARP, the U.S. government’s High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.</p>
<p>For example, <em></em>after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plants, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43083235/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/did-atmosphere-give-warning-japan-quake/" target="_blank">MSNBC</a> reported:</p>
<p>“[T]he atmosphere above the epicenter … underwent unusual changes in the days leading up to the disaster.”</p>
<p><em>PC 2012</em> then points out that “the MSNBC report did not address whether increases in both the concentration of electrons and infrared radiation in the ionosphere in the days before the earthquake might have been caused by the sort of technologies” described in my report and others.</p>
<p>Related to geoengineering and ranking as the 8th most censored topic, a section covering “the fairy tale of clean and safe nuclear power” cites several pieces, including Jeff St Clair’s <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/03/24/inside-america-s-most-dangerous-nuclear-plant/" target="_blank">Inside America’s Most Dangerous Nuclear Plant</a>, fingering Indian Point in New York. At least two others would name Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state as the most dangerous: <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=145326474&amp;ft=3&amp;f=145326474" target="_blank">whistleblower Donna Busche</a>, who warns of an impeding hydrogen explosion from the leaking radioactive sludge, and Brainz, which names Hanford the <a href="http://brainz.org/ten-most-radioactive-places-earth/" target="_blank">10th most radioactive spot</a> on Planet Earth.</p>
<p>Related to the nuclear threat, the Centre for Research on Globalization will soon publish an updated version of Prof. Michel Chossudovsky’s <a href="http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=25185" target="_blank">Towards a World War III Scenario: The Dangers of Nuclear War</a>.</p>
<p>After reading the 76-page e-book which only costs $5, I’d characterize it as an essential read for anyone willing to look into the eyes of MADness. The mutually assured destruction of nuclear war is laid out in the US military’s plan, already underway, to modernize the nuclear stockpile for use on the other side of the world, as if blowback doesn’t exist. Chossudovsky’s message is clear: Nuclear states are the real terrorists in today’s world; the antiwar movement must unite and uphold 9/11 truth.</p>
<p>Information like this is what is censored from mainstream media.</p>
<p>The Project itself has been censored – for reporting on 9/11 truth, as this <a href="http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/63991" target="_blank">KPFA interview</a> from 2010 reveals. Inter Press Service contracted with Peter Phillips and Mickey Huff to write the piece, and then refused to publish it and permanently severed their relationship. 9/11 Truth is covered in Project Censored’s <a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/censored-2011-new-book-release-on-915/" target="_blank">2011 edition</a>.</p>
<p><em>PC 2012</em> includes the impacts of media censorship and misinformation in light of wars, Obama’s assassination program, environmental destruction, Wall Street crime, internet surveillance, and healthcare, including the refusal by corporate media to accurately discuss the single payer option.</p>
<p>Another theme is collaborating for the common good. Corporate media giants stay mum, for example, on key alternatives proposed by various sectors that would not profit industry giants or maintain the status quo, like Ellen Brown’s many articles promoting state-run banks. (See <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/new-economy/a-choice-for-states-banks-not-budget-crises" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/new-economy/the-north-dakota-miracle-not-all-about-oil" target="_blank">here</a> for two examples.)</p>
<p>These censored stories have their own powerful effect. Natural News writers<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028716_GMOs_food_labels.html" target="_blank">Mike Adams</a>’ and <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/029168_GMO_foods_labeling.html" target="_blank">Ethan Huff’s</a> 2010 articles about federal agency refusal to label genetically modified foods (ranked as the 22nd most censored story) sparked the GMO-label movement we see today.</p>
<p>Not only researchers, but the general public, as well, can benefit from the book’s section on propaganda, spanning several chapters. In its international section, <em>PC 2012</em> spotlights media distortion of the color revolutions and ongoing genocide in Palestine, even applauding the cable show <em>Treme </em>for its coverage of life in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, rating it far better than MSM coverage.</p>
<p>Journalists focused on amplifying info withheld or skewed by media giants can best serve the public, and democracy, by using Project Censored’s annual books. Even past editions provide valuable links, as many of these stories are ongoing.</p>
<p>Stalling passage of PIPA is only temporary; radicals – that is, anyone speaking truth today – need to arm themselves with the most reliable information available – most of which is outside mainstream sources. By giving hundreds of links to reliable reports, Project Censored provides those resources.</p>

Throughout space there is energy.</em>  &#8212; Nikola Tesla, 1892<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death.  Was he for real? A crackpot? Part of an early experiment in corporate-government control?</p>
<p>We know that he was undoubtedly persecuted by the energy power brokers of his day &#8212; namely Thomas Edison, whom we are taught in school to revere as a genius.  He was also attacked by J.P. Morgan and other &#8220;captains of industry.&#8221; Upon Tesla&#8217;s death on January 7th, 1943, the U.S. government moved into his lab and apartment confiscating all of his scientific research, and to this day none of this research has been made public.</p>
<p>Besides his persecution by corporate-government interests (which is practically a certification of authenticity), there is at least one solid indication of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s integrity &#8212; he tore up a contract with Westinghouse that was worth billions in order to save the company from paying him his huge royalty payments.</p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s take a look at what Nikola Tesla &#8212; a man who died broke and alone &#8212; has actually given to the world.  For better or worse, with credit or without, he changed the face of the planet in ways that perhaps no man ever has.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><strong>1. Alternating Current</strong> &#8211; This is where it all began, and what ultimately caused such a stir at the 1893 World&#8217;s Expo in Chicago.  A war was leveled ever-after between the vision of Edison and the vision of Tesla for how electricity would be produced and distributed.  The division can be summarized as one of cost and safety: The DC current that Edison (backed by General Electric) had been working on was costly over long distances, and produced dangerous sparking from the required converter (called a commutator).  Regardless, Edison and his backers utilized the general &#8220;dangers&#8221; of electric current to instill fear in Tesla&#8217;s alternative: Alternating Current.  As proof, Edison sometimes electrocuted animals at demonstrations.  Consequently, Edison gave the world the electric chair, while simultaneously maligning Tesla&#8217;s attempt to offer safety at a lower cost.  Tesla responded by demonstrating that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting current through his own body to produce light.  This Edison-Tesla (GE-Westinghouse) feud in 1893 was the culmination of over a decade of shady business deals, stolen ideas, and patent suppression that Edison and his moneyed interests wielded over Tesla&#8217;s inventions. Yet, despite it all, it is Tesla&#8217;s system that provides power generation and distribution to North America in our modern era.</p>
<p><strong>2. Light </strong>&#8211; Of course he didn&#8217;t invent light itself, but he did invent how light can be harnessed and distributed.  Tesla developed and used florescent bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry &#8220;invented&#8221; them. At the World&#8217;s Fair, Tesla took glass tubes and bent them into famous scientists&#8217; names, in effect creating the first neon signs.  However, it is his Tesla Coil that might be the most impressive, and controversial.  The Tesla Coil is certainly something that big industry would have liked to suppress: the concept that the Earth itself is a magnet that can generate electricity (electromagnetism) utilizing frequencies as a transmitter.  All that is needed on the other end is the receiver &#8212; much like a radio.</p>
<p><strong>3. X-rays &#8211; </strong>Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the late 1800s, but Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a precursor to <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/kirlian-photography-shows-organic.html">Kirlian photography</a>, which has the ability to document life force, to what we now use in medical diagnostics, this was a transformative invention of which Tesla <a href="http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/28/4/1189.full">played a central role</a>.  X-rays, like so many of Tesla&#8217;s contributions, stemmed from his belief that everything we need to understand the universe is virtually around us at all times, but we need to use our minds to develop real-world devices to augment our innate perception of existence.</p>
<p><strong>4. Radio</strong> &#8211; Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him to be the inventor of radio to this day.  However, the Supreme Court overturned Marconi&#8217;s patent in 1943, when it was proven that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi.  Radio signals are just another frequency that needs a transmitter and receiver, which Tesla also demonstrated in 1893 during a presentation before The National Electric Light Association.  In 1897 Tesla applied for two patents <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US645576" rel="nofollow"> US 645576</a>, and <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US649621" rel="nofollow">US 649621</a>. In 1904, however, The U.S. Patent Office reversed its decision, awarding Marconi a patent for the invention of radio, possibly influenced by Marconi&#8217;s financial backers in the States, who included Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie. This also allowed the U.S. government (among others) to avoid having to pay the royalties that were being claimed by Tesla.</p>
<p><strong>5. Remote Control</strong> &#8211; This invention was a natural outcropping of radio. Patent No.<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=0613809.PN.&amp;OS=PN/0613809&amp;RS=PN/0613809">613809</a> was the first remote controlled model boat, demonstrated in 1898.  Utilizing several large batteries; radio signals controlled switches, which then energized the boat&#8217;s propeller, rudder, and scaled-down running lights. While this exact technology was not widely used for some time, we now can see the power that was appropriated by the military in its pursuit of <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/6-technologies-for-de-humanizing-war.html">remote controlled war</a>. Radio controlled tanks were introduced by the Germans in WWII, and developments in this realm have since slid quickly away from the direction of human freedom.</p>
<p><strong>6. Electric Motor &#8211; </strong>Tesla&#8217;s invention of the electric motor has finally been popularized by <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">a car</a> brandishing his name.  While the technical specifications are beyond the scope of this summary, suffice to say that Tesla&#8217;s invention of a motor with rotating magnetic fields could have freed mankind much sooner from the stranglehold of Big Oil.  However, his invention in 1930 succumbed to the economic crisis and the world war that followed. Nevertheless, this invention has fundamentally changed the landscape of what we now take for granted: industrial fans, household applicances, water pumps, machine tools, power tools, disk drives, electric wristwatches and compressors.</p>
<p><strong>7. Robotics</strong> &#8211; Tesla&#8217;s overly enhanced scientific mind led him to the idea that all living beings are merely driven by external impulses.  He stated: &#8220;I have by every thought and act of mine, demonstrated, and does so daily, to my absolute satisfaction that I am an automaton endowed with power of movement, which merely responds to external stimuli.&#8221;  Thus, the concept of the robot was born.  However, an element of the human remained present, as Tesla asserted that these human replicas should have limitations &#8212; namely growth and propagation. Nevertheless, Tesla unabashedly embraced all of what intelligence could produce.  His visions for a future filled with intelligent cars, robotic human companions, and the use of sensors, and autonomous systems are detailed in a must-read entry in the <a href="http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=1451-48690603163V">Serbian Journal of Electrical Engineering, 2006 (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8. Laser</strong> &#8211; Tesla&#8217;s invention of the laser may be one of the best examples of the good and evil bound up together within the mind of man.  Lasers have transformed surgical applications in an undeniably beneficial way, and they have given rise to much of our current digital media. However, with this leap in innovation we have also crossed into the land of science fiction.  From Reagan&#8217;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; laser defense system to today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/12/orwellian-non-lethal-war-waged-against.html">Orwellian &#8220;non-lethal&#8221; weapons&#8217;</a> arsenal, which includes laser rifles and directed energy &#8220;death rays,&#8221; there is great potential for development in both directions.</p>
<p><strong>9 and 10. Wireless Communications and Limitless Free Energy</strong> &#8211; These two are inextricably linked, as they were the last straw for the power elite &#8212; what good is energy if it can&#8217;t be metered and controlled?  Free?  Never.  J.P. Morgan backed Tesla with $150,000 to build a tower that would use the natural frequencies of our universe to transmit data, including a wide range of information communicated through images, voice messages, and text.  This represented the world&#8217;s first wireless communications, but it also meant that aside from the cost of the tower itself, the universe was filled with free energy that could be utilized to form a world wide web connecting all people in all places, as well as allow people to harness the free energy around them.  Essentially, the 0&#8242;s and 1&#8242;s of the universe are embedded in the fabric of existence for each of us to access as needed.  Nikola Tesla was dedicated to empowering the individual to receive and transmit this data virtually free of charge.  But we know the ending to that story . . . until now?</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TaqAcrCPlhI/AAAAAAAAISQ/5uq527jnmDM/book-shape.jpg" alt="" align="left" />Tesla had perhaps thousands of other ideas and inventions that remain unreleased.  A look at his <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yvwev4">hundreds of patents</a> shows a glimpse of the scope he intended to offer.  If you feel that the additional technical and scientific research of Nikola Tesla should be revealed for public scrutiny and discussion, instead of suppressed by big industry and even our supposed <a href="http://poorrichards-blog.blogspot.com/2011/12/history-of-mits-blatant-suppression-of.html">institutions of higher education</a>, please <strong><a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/%21/petition/release-nikola-teslas-technical-and-scientific-research/S9CjXwh5">sign this petition</a></strong> to demand that power brokers everywhere learn that we are ready to Occupy Energy and learn about what our universe really has to offer.</p>
<p>The release of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s technical and scientific research &#8212; specifically his research into harnessing electricity from the ionosphere at a facility called Wardenclyffe &#8212; is a necessary step toward true freedom of information.  The petition has a goal of 25,000 signatures and needs your support, but whether or not it is reached please continue to add your voice by sharing this information with as many people as possible.</p>
<p>A Facebook event page for the official call on January 7th, the anniversary of Tesla&#8217;s death, can be found here:  <a title="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332" dir="ltr" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=311216412237332</a></p>
<p>For additional information about the demand for release, please visit:<a title="http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/" dir="ltr" href="http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://releaseteslasresearch.weebly.com/</a></p>
<p>As they state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tell your friends, bring it up and discuss it at your next general assembly, do whatever you can to get the word out, organize locally to make a stand for the release of Nikola Tesla&#8217;s research&#8230;. America is tired of corrupt corporate greed, supported by The American government, holding us back in a stagnant society in the name of profit . . . The Energy Crisis is a lie.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an aside: there are some who have pointed out that Tesla&#8217;s experimentation with the ionosphere very well could have caused the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~onichelson/ONichelsonTUNGUSKA.pdf">massive explosion over Tunguska, Siberia in 1908,</a> which leveled an estimated 60 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers, and may even have led to the much maligned <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/08/weather-wars-and-devils-haarp.html">HAARP</a> technology.  I submit that we would do well to remember that technology is never the true enemy; it is the <em>misuse</em> of technology that can enslave rather than free mankind from its animal-level survivalism.</p>
<p>Please view the video below, which does an excellent job at personalizing this largely forgotten human being, as well as show the reasons why to this day he is not a household name.</p>

<p>And here is a video that offers an essential alternative view of ancient Egypt and other cultures that employed pyramidal structures, which suggests the staggering outer limits of what Tesla was attempting to harness and offer to humanity:</p>

			<p><em>&#8220;Echoing Angela Merkels call for a more united Europe, European Central Bank president Jean Claude Trichet calls for further fiscal and monetary consolidation of EMU countries.</em></p>
<p><em>Talking about the current EMU crisis, which he characterizes as &#8220;the gravest crisis since World War I&#8221; , he calls for further financial consolidation which, he hopes, would stabilize the economies of the members of EMU.&#8221;</em>  <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/trichet-echoes-merkls-call-fiscally-united-europe">Source</a></p>
<p>A lot has been said about the Euro&#8217;s problems, most from a purely economic standpoint. It is clear that the imbalances that the Euro created in Europe are not sustainable.</p>
<p>Germany and its satellites (Netherlands, Finland, Austria) are much more competitive than Club Med. Because of the Euro the latter group of nations cannot devalue their currencies resulting in trade deficits and net capital out flow to the North.</p>
<p>Therefore the Euro&#8217;s existence depends on a permanent bail out mechanism for the South which not sustainable.</p>
<p>But economics are of lesser import here. The Euro was not created to build wealth but as <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/10/could-euro-die.html">a step toward a World Currency.</a> To rule the world, one must first rule Europe. Clearly, the Euro is the central bankers&#8217; pet project.</p>
<p><strong>GRADUAL PROCESS</strong></p>
<p>The current crisis is not at all unexpected. The Eurocrats couldn&#8217;t get their coveted Federation in 1992, at the time of the Maastricht Treaty so they had to settle for the Euro. </p>
<p>They reasoned the &#8216;right major crises&#8217; would pop up at some point, making clear that monetary union without fiscal union is impossible. They expect the nation states of Europe to surrender fiscal sovereignty to save the Euro</p>
<p>In <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100012986/revenge-of-the-sovereign-nation/">a recent article</a>, an insider journalist, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, exposed this process:</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain architects of EMU calculated that the single currency would itself become the catalyst for a quantum leap in integration that could not be achieved otherwise&#8230;.. This was the Monnet Method of <em>fait accompli</em> and facts on the ground. These great manipulators of Europe&#8217;s destiny may yet succeed, but so far the crisis is not been remotely beneficial.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ends his intriguing report with the point that, &#8220;I think it is fair to say events are unfolding more or less as we expected.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>WILL THE EURO FAIL?</strong></p>
<p>If you look at the economic data, IT SHOULD. But if you realize the world is run by a few bankers who want World Government, with a World Currency the answer is &#8216;no&#8217;.</p>
<p>However, over the last two years, the Eurocrats have suffered badly. The popular resistance, both in the North and the South, is dramatic. Recently, the German Supreme Court allowed Merkel to go ahead with what had been done, but clearly reprimanded her for the lack of democratic legitimacy and the breach of the Maastricht Treaty, which does not allow fiscal or bond cooperation.</p>
<p>What happens if Greece leaves the Euro? Could they ever allow Romania, Bulgaria, and all these other second-rate nations in if even Greece couldn&#8217;t deal with the Euro&#8217;s dynamics? How would they ever sell World Currency if they cannot even make the Euro work?</p>
<p>Their biggest problem is that they lack all legitimacy. In 2005, France and the Netherlands rejected their &#8216;European Constitution&#8217; by a resounding 60-40 margin. They pushed ahead with Lisbon anyway, but this was a disaster.</p>
<p>They need the popular vote. <em>The Protocols </em>make clear they need to say: &#8216;you wanted this, you voted for it&#8217;. Without this legitimacy, they face revolt at any time. They can&#8217;t push ahead if the underlying treaties and laws were never accepted by the populace.</p>
<p>So when Papandreou calls a referendum and &#8216;the markets&#8217; and Merkozy are in total shock, what does this show? It just exposes the quicksand under their feet</p>
<p>They know this, but they are losing. They are losing the battle for the mind and they are pushing ahead because they have no other way.</p>
<p><strong>WORLD GOVERNMENT AT STAKE</strong></p>
<p>This whole European mess represents massive crisis for mankind. If the Euro fails, a death blow will be landed on their NWO project. It will take them decades to recover and resume the march to World Government. But they don&#8217;t have this time, because people are waking up.</p>
<p>True, the Occupiers are still largely clueless, but in Europe, where austerity is already biting badly, people are being forced to look for answers. There is talk of debt repudiation; there is the Icelandic example and there is of course interest free currency. <em>In Germany dozens of regional currencies are flowering: they report 100% per annum growth.</em></p>
<p>It is now more important then ever to start talking solutions. We must keep in mind that this credit crunch is a total fabrication that could be <a href="http://realcurrencies.wordpress.com/2011/10/23/the-wolfson-prize-i-win/">solved over night.</a></p>
<p>Interest free currency is the main solution. Debt free Government currencies are a quick fix, but <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/10/reassessing-greenback-and-other.html">far from ideal</a>. Much better is<a href="http://publicbankinginstitute.org/">Public Banking</a>, which is interest free credit provided by state-owned banks. But eventually the Illuminati (Masonic Jewish) <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/10/for-self-determination-we-need-free.html">monopoly of currencies must end.</a></p>
<p>With the Oceans on the brink of collapse after Deep Horizon and Fukushima, with the Credit Crunch, with (HAARP induced) earthquakes everywhere and wars and rumors of wars its fair to say the NWO is preparing for their endgame.</p>
<p>But seeing their weakness in Europe, the result is not a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The challenge is to provide real alternatives. It is not enough to expose them. They expect a fight, but they expect to succeed,because they don&#8217;t think we can create the right solutions.</p>
<p>Jacques Attali, another insider: &#8216;Most of these new contestants will propose no system of substitution&#8230; Except for a handful who will propose a return to theocracy.&#8217;</p>
<p>So we know what to do. Let&#8217;s get going.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/deesradiationcali2.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/deesradiationcali2.jpg" alt="" /></a>Ever since March 11, 2011, when the Japanese earthquake rattled the Asian country, there have been increasing numbers of strange coincidences involving nuclear power plants, natural disasters, and mismanagement of facilities. I say strange coincidences, because it now appears that nuclear power plants fall into the same category as the recent earthquakes that seem to be increasing in frequency and proximity to highly populated areas, as well as tornadoes that seem to be doing the same.</p>
<p>As for the Japanese situation, after months of claims by both the Japanese and American “authorities,” as well as the mainstream media that the situation in Japan was not as serious as “conspiracy theorists” were making it out to be, the Japanese Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters has finally been forced to admit that at least three of the nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant had, indeed, <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-06-06/world/japan.nuclear.meltdown_1_nuclear-reactors-fuel-rods-tokyo-electric-power?_s=PM:WORLD">melted down</a>.<br />
<a name="more"></a><br />
Of course, these admissions came well after the mainstream media had long since stopped reporting on the Japanese crisis. But the fact that the Japanese reactors had melted down is not news to those of us who no longer follow the mainstream media. Indeed, most readers of the <a href="http://www.infowars.com/japanese-nuclear-meltdown-confirmed/">independent media</a> were well aware of the nuclear meltdowns in what was virtually real time.</p>
<div>
Yet the Japanese crisis is not the only nuclear emergency that has occurred since March. Nor is it the only one to be ignored by the corporate media.</div>
<div>Just a week after Fukushima, I wrote an article regarding a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/03/cover-up-in-canada-radioactive-leak.html">Canada’s Ontario Power Generation had released radioactive water into Lake Ontario</a> via a leak in the Pickering A nuclear generating station. Like the Japanese, the Canadian government deemed this accident to be of little consequence, even though Lake Ontario is the main source of drinking water for millions of people. Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and the Canadian government even began using the term “demineralized” in place of “radioactive” when discussing the leak.</p>
<p>Fast forward to June and we now have three more nuclear power plants under threat from “natural” disasters. Ft. Calhoun, while receiving scant coverage by the mainstream media, is now<a href="http://www.infowars.com/fukushima-in-nebraska-raging-flood-waters-threaten-nuclear-catastrophe/">surrounded by flood water</a> from the Missouri river. The facility is a storage site for 20 years worth of nuclear waste material; specifically, spent fuel rods from different plants in the state as well at its own.</p>
<p>When asked about the safety concerns regarding the facility, Gary Gates, CEO of the Ft. Calhoun facility, said, “There is no water inside the plant. The reactor is covered with borated water. The spent fuel is covered with borated water, which we want it to be. That’s intentional. That’s where it should be. The floodwaters are outside Fort Calhoun, not inside.”</p>
<p>At this time, there is no concrete evidence that there has been a meltdown or radioactive leakage from the Ft. Calhoun plant. However, there are some suspicious occurrences at the facility. First, there was a fire in the switch room, but it is maintained that this fire was contained to the switch room and that it was not flood related. The fire did shut down the cooling pumps for about 90 minutes but the backup generators were quickly used to return power to the pumps.</p>
<p>Later, one of the berms holding back the flood waters <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/06/protective-flood-berm-collapses-at-ft.html">mysteriously collapsed</a>. Unfortunately, with the weather in Nebraska still wet and nasty, levees are still being breached and dams are still overflowing. Under these conditions, a damaged berm is something that Ft. Calhoun can ill afford.</p>
<p>Strangely, even though the “switch room fire” occurred on June 7th, the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/faa-closes-airspace-over-flooded-nebraska-nuclear-power-plant-2011-6">FAA had imposed a flight ban</a> within a two mile radius of the nuclear plant. The FAA claims the flight ban is a result of the Missouri flooding; but, as Ricky Kreitner of the Business Insider points out, “[But] the FAA ban specifically lists the Forth Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant as the location for the flight plan.”</p>
<p>Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) spokesman Jeff Hanson stated that the flight ban is due to power lines and “security reasons that we can’t reveal.” Of course, the real reasons for the ban are unknown, but it is highly suspect that water and power lines on the ground have prompted a ban on traffic in the air.</p></div>
<div>
Not only that, but the Red Cross shelter next to the Fort Calhoun facility has been closed, an odd thing to do in the event of an emergency. Particularly when the Red Cross is on location as a result of an emergency in the first place.</p>
<p>Regarding the Ft. Calhoun plant, <a href="http://localtalknews.com/home-page-columnists/marvin-wolf/923-what-the-fukushima-is-going-on-in-omaha">Marvin Wolf</a>, editor of Local Talk News writes:</div>
<blockquote><p>The government is telling us not to panic. All is under control, just like in Japan. But here are a few troubling inconsistencies. One, the Red Cross shelter next to the Fort Calhoun plant has been closed. They claim it was due to “decreased need.” During a flood? Now there is a no-fly zone around the plant. Then there is the disturbing news that the spent fuel rod pool was so full that they store the surplus fuel rods in a dry storage area outside the safety of the pool. How long will that area stay dry and what happens if it gets wet? One reporter claims the dry storage bunker is now half-submerged. One of the intake structures is prone to flooding that could affect the water pumps. Non-functional water pumps? Does that sound familiar?</p></blockquote>
<div><a href="http://activistpost.net/camp-fema.html"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_qLAIskTQXUc/TUNgjXsO6uI/AAAAAAAAGPo/nnOTmeMom_s/campfema.jpg" alt="" /></a>Wolf goes on to suggest that the Russians are claiming that there was a nuclear accident at the plant due to flooding and that the<a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/june262011/nrc-nebraska.php">Obama administration has ordered a news blackout</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to Ft. Calhoun, the Cooper Nuclear Station near Brownsville, Nebraska is also under a state of alert. Much like the Ft. Calhoun station, the Cooper Nuclear Station is under threat of being flooded out. This comes just days after two tornadoes ripped through the area.</p>
<p>We are also watching as a raging fire threatens the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The fire apparently<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/0628/New-Mexico-fires-threaten-Los-Alamos-nuclear-weapons-lab-again">started on Saturday</a> in the Santa Fe National Forest and is now bearing down on the town and the lab. Not only are nuclear weapons tested in the lab, but there are approximately 20,000 barrels of discarded plutonium-related nuclear waste at the facility. A fire of this level at this particular facility could unleash devastating amounts of radioactive pollution. Even a loss of power to the facility could trigger a full-fledged emergency.</p>
<p>Naturally, one hopes that the Japanese and Canadians manage to get control over their power plant malfunctions. One also hopes that the floods recede and the fire goes out.</p>
<p>Yet, amid these hopes, one also begins to wonder if all this is more than just coincidence. After all, the first tell-tale signs of treachery is an attempt to cover it up.</p>
<p>Consider the track record of the corporate media, government agencies, and private facility owners just over the last few months.</p>
<p>We know that after the earthquake in Japan and the subsequent damage at Fukushima, the Japanese government actively covered up the extent of the damage from the international community, the press, and the Japanese people. In fact, the media and foreign governments, particularly the United States, aided them in doing so. The US government even went so far as to discourage Americans from purchasing potassium iodide supplements to protect themselves from the radiation coming across the ocean.</p>
<p>We also know that the Canadian government has been even more successful in covering up the pollution in Lake Ontario.</p>
<p>So, given this reputation, one would be justified in taking anything their government says with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>However, it is also true that an attempt to cover up an accident, mistake, or incompetence does not necessarily mean that the individual or agency attempting the cover up actually caused the incident. Even if the cover up is of a monumental scale.</p>
<p>But it certainly doesn’t help. And the fact that in the last few months so many nuclear facilities have come under threat from so-called natural disasters is starting to look a bit funny. After all, much of the flooding at Ft. Calhoun was caused by the government itself, in an apparent attempt to protect reservoirs.</p>
<p>As Wolf writes, “Keep in mind that some flooding was deliberately caused by the Army releasing water from reservoirs to protect them from failing. This has flooded levees. The Army has in the past dynamited levees to direct the water elsewhere – like where poor people live and work – to protect where rich people live and work.”</p>
<p>But the real question is whether or not this done as a necessity, an afterthought, or for a more sinister purpose altogether. Considering the fact that many governments now possess <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/08/weather-wars-and-devils-haarp.html">HAARP</a> and similar technology that is capable of creating earthquakes, floods, and tornadoes as well as the fact that these governments rarely have the best interest of their citizens at heart, the idea of intentional destruction of nuclear facilities is not so far-fetched. It would certainly contribute to population reduction if all of this radiation combined with the Fukushima fallout and spread across the US. It would also provide an emergency situation that some would use to justify an even bigger police state and perhaps forced relocation.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting to note that, in the new Super 8 movie, there is a scene in which the US government deliberately sets a forest fire in order to force citizens out of the town and into military evacuation centers. In the movie, it was for the purpose of hiding secret government research. Was this <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/08/post-apocalyptic-predictive-programming.html">predictive programming</a> or just yet another coincidence?</p>
<p>Let me be clear – I’m not saying “the government did Fukushima” or “the government flooded Nebraska or set the fires in New Mexico.” But I am saying I don’t put it past them. I am saying it’s entirely physically possible. And I am saying these recent events have become a bit too coincidental to be ignored. Considering the track record, I don’t think we can afford to be naive.</p>

			<p>The catastrophic disaster that swept Japan into a new stone age is truly an earth-shattering milestone. Worldwide grief and empathy is real and deserved. If this occurrence were only, a script out of a Godzilla B movie, or just lyrics from a <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/ika/go+godzilla+go_20204671.html">ringtone song</a>, the hurt or the aftermath would not be so horrible.</p>
<p><em>you cannot run in any direction</em></p>
<p><em> no place to hide ain&#8217;t got no protection</em></p>
<p><em>it can be sorrow, blood, and destruction</em></p>
<p><em>but it can give you incredible emotion</em></p>
<p>How does one explain this calamity? Is it a mysterious act of God, or is it modern technology run amuck?</p>
<p>As long as the earthquake was not triggered by <a href="http://www.ufo-blogger.com/2011/03/japan-earthquake-tsunami-haarp.html">HAARP</a> like intentions, the wall of tsunami destruction is part of the risk of residing in the active zone of the ring of fire. The meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant complex is far less than a matter of fate. Is nuclear electric generation just too risky to chance or can humanity trust upon technology to institute new safeguards for future developments?</p>
<p>The answer usually depends upon one’s viewpoint on the Global Warming theory. Those who worship at the altar of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> love their environmentalist adoration. While nuclear power is CO2 friendly, the radiation peril is too threatening to accept. The half-life of these zealots often reflects the mental capacity of Homer Simpson and the appearance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycephaly">Polycephaly</a> mutant beasts of burden.</p>
<p>Those who see Global Warming as a manageable problem often place great reliance on scientific progress in solving and overcoming environmental challenges. These people normally populate the engineering professions and research laboratories that spawn the next evolution of made-made technological marvels.</p>
<p>Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger write in the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704312504575618972157288244.html">WSJ</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is a better way. Nations should focus on lowering the cost of clean energy, not raising the cost of fossil energy. The goal? Make clean energy cheap enough to become a viable option for poor as well as rich nations. Until that happens, emissions will continue to rise, and no effort to regulate carbon can succeed.</p>
<p>How do we accomplish that? Stop subsidizing old technology that will never compete with fossil fuels and create incentives for innovation. Along with ramping up support for research, governments should buy cutting-edge clean-energy technologies, prove them—and then give away the intellectual property, so others can improve on it&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there are those who view Global Warming as a hoax and a political grab for further consolidation of a centralized society under the control of a corporate/state oligarchy. The evidence is on their side. Exhibit 1, <a href="http://citizenpoweralliance.wordpress.com/industrial-wind-and-the-wall-street-cap-and-trade-fraud/">Cap and Trade</a> proposals demonstrate the total disconnects for meeting the energy needs of a modern society.</p>
<p>The high and mighty culture would like you to believe that nuclear energy from civilian reactors is a centerpiece of scientific superiority over nature. Well, there are a few problems with this conclusion. Since the nuclear genie escaped from the bottle, the myth that science is equal to God has run wild for decades. At the risk of condemnation by the scientific inquisition court, is the world a better place to live under the canopy of a mushroom cloud?</p>

<p>Admittedly, the symbol of this age is the face of existential oblivion, dressed up in space suits on life support. The fallout from the Fukushima reactor disaster will last longer than the radioactive dust that contaminates the ecosphere. At question is not solely the safety of the nuclear electrical generation process, but the notion of pushing the limits of human endeavors that endanger the survival of the species itself.</p>
<p>A favorite and world-class curmudgeon, Fred Reed, proposes a valid and alternative conclusion to the insanity in, <a href="http://mensnewsdaily.com/x/2011/03/08/why-we-need-an-asteroid-strike/">Why We Need an Asteroid Strike</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I figure that what we need is to tear the whole sorry system down and see what comes next. The best hope is that a patriot will learn how to impel some unused interplanetary object, Phobos or Deimos or Ganymede maybe, into Washington at ninety percent of the speed of light. This would eliminate the teachers unions, the Pentagon, AIPAC, Fox News, Langley, the Washington Post, lobbies, and my mother-in-law. Cockroaches would doubtless survive, that being what they do best, and evolve into a civilization less degraded than ours, briefly&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/nuclear-power-cartoon.jpg" alt="nuclear-museum.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="0" align="Left" /></p>
<p>The disinformation coming out of Japan from official circles all qualifies as radiation poisoning. The Green revolution is nothing more than a denial cult of blind faith in the power of mankind to destroy society with all the best intentions that the Tempter can muster. Wind and solar are not candidates for prime time. Renewable deficiencies are well documented by <a href="http://www.windaction.org/">IWA</a> and <a href="http://citizenpoweralliance.org/">CPA</a> and suggest that only a &#8220;true believer&#8221; would accept the prevarications of the anti fossil fuel lobby. Sentencing clean coal to the pits of a dark hole verges on calling for the release of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</a> from prison.</p>
<p>After the Japanese disaster, the nuclear industry needs an alternative to the current reactors, now perceived as unsafe. <a href="http://thisweekinnuclear.com/?p=1193">John Wheeler</a> in This Week in Nuclear, evaluates the safety of small nuclear reactors</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These smaller reactors contain less nuclear fuel. This smaller amount of fuel (with passive cooling I’ll mention in a minute) slows down the progression of reactor accidents. This slower progression gives operators more time to take action to keep the reactor cool. Where operators in large reactors have minutes or hours to react to events, operators of SMRs may have hours or even days. This means the chance of a reactor damaging accident is very, very remote.</p>
<p>Even better, most SMRs are small enough that they cannot over heat and melt down. They get all the cooling they need from air circulating around the reactor. This is a big deal because if SMRs can’t melt down, then they can’t release radioactive gas that would pose a risk to the public. Again, this means the need for external emergency actions is virtually eliminated.</p>
<p>Also, some SMRs are not water cooled; they use gas, liquid salt, or liquid metal coolants that operate at low pressures. This lower operating pressure means that if radioactive gases build up inside the containment building there is less pressure to push the gas out and into the air. If there is no pressure to push radioactive gas into the environment and all of it stays inside the plant, then it poses no risk to the public.</p>
<p>SMRs are small enough to be built underground&#8221;.

<p>&#8220;So called&#8221; miracles of science often become the thimerosal babies of tomorrow. Likewise, the politics of nuclear energy are riddled in contradictions. <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/energy/articles/2009/03/16/lessons-from-the-yucca-mountain-nuclear-waste-storage-debate">Lessons from the Yucca Mountain</a> Nuclear Waste Storage Debate, points out the ineptness of domestic energy policy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over the past decade, more than 7,000 shipments of radioactive nuclear waste have been sent, without any problem, to a government repository in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>This crucial repository is not the ill-fated Yucca Mountain, the Nevada site that has been steeped in controversy since Congress selected it 22 years ago to store the country&#8217;s civilian nuclear waste. Yucca Mountain, in fact, has gotten so bogged down in legal and political fights that <a href="http://www.usnews.com/sections/news/obama/index.html">President Barack Obama</a>, in his new budget, is proposing to eliminate almost all of its funding and explore &#8220;alternatives,&#8221; raising serious questions about how the United States will resolve its nuclear waste problems—and, for that matter, whether the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/stimulus/2009/01/07/keen-for-a-revival-the-nuclear-industry-eyes-the-stimulus-package.html">nuclear industry</a> will be able to grow in coming decades.The functioning repository is located in Carlsbad, N.M., and it may hold some useful answers. Since opening in 1999, it has received more than 60,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste from the country&#8217;s nuclear defense facilities. Experts say its success offers valuable clues about how Washington can learn from the mistakes made at Yucca Mountain to find a lasting waste solution&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<div>If the nuclear industry is targeted for demise, only natural gas or coal can produce the needed electric energy on a scale to keep the economy viable. The alternative of rolling brown outs are a favored tactic used by such titans of business ethics as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis">Enron</a>. Welcome to the era of designed shortages and inflated costs.</div>
<p>The risks of hydrofracking techniques to extract natural gas are very real and profound. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/us/27gas.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1&amp;hp">New York Times</a> reports on contamination of the water table.</p>
<blockquote><p>¶More than 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater was produced by Pennsylvania wells over the past three years, far more than has been previously disclosed. Most of this water — enough to cover Manhattan in three inches — was sent to treatment plants not equipped to remove many of the toxic materials in drilling waste.</p>
<p>¶At least 12 sewage treatment plants in three states accepted gas industry wastewater and discharged waste that was only partly treated into rivers, lakes and streams.</p>
<p>¶Of more than 179 wells producing wastewater with high levels of radiation, at least 116 reported levels of radium or other radioactive materials 100 times as high as the levels set by federal drinking-water standards. At least 15 wells produced wastewater carrying more than 1,000 times the amount of radioactive elements considered acceptable.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Weird science is a serious problem, but factitious global warming is a well-designed dose of irradiation that attacks the mush of feeble-minded morons who want to be &#8220;PC&#8221; in a culture gone mad. If you surrender to the totalitarian collectivists, you are accepting the global gulag. Clean coal offers the best economic and safe energy future for an independent America. Synthetic fuel conversion from coal into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel">synfuel</a> is the best way to reduce the addiction of imported oil.</p>

<p>As the mainstream media attempts to downplay the latest die-off event,  which has now gone global, it is worthwhile to keep track of the story  lines.  Feel free to add your own to the comments section, and we will  update accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Mainstream Explanations:</strong> Lightning, hail, mid-air collision,  power lines, and New Year fireworks for the birds . . . but disease for  the fish.  This is even rolling eyes in the mainstream media.  Birds are  incredibly sensitive to their environment (think Canary in the coal  mine), and the thought that they were caught by surprise, or that they  &#8220;fowled&#8221; up their flight pattern is patently ridiculous.  And where are  the roasted birds from this lightning strike?  And what about fish dying  in the same region?  Just a &#8220;disease&#8221; coincidence.  One mainstream  headline has to be enshrined as the saddest attempt at sensationalism,  while revealing an obvious natural conclusion <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/03/arkansas.falling.birds/index.html">Falling Birds Likely Died From Massive Trauma</a>.  Really?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><strong>Meteor showers:</strong> We are in a period of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrantids">intense seasonal meteor showers</a>,  and several perennial YouTubers reported <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/2010TheCountdown#p/u/6/NRcqgn4dFh0">hearing sonic booms</a> in the area  that could have indicated a local <a href="http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/meteor.html">shock wave</a>.    This would be one non-conspiratorial, natural cause that actually  makes  sense, but it is hard to connect to both birds and fish, unless  it  produced a disabling frequency.  There were indeed other sound  anomalies according to the report highlighted above.</p>
<p><strong>New Madrid Fault Line:</strong> An excellent article by The American Dream collated data about the <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/is-the-new-madrid-fault-earthquake-zone-coming-to-life">recent earthquake activity</a> along this fault line that runs along the mid-eastern section of the U.S.  Combined with <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/01/penn-allows-gas-fracking-waste-to-be.html">gas fracking,</a> the immense geological activity in the region, and the BP oil drilling   disaster, which off-gassed the dispersant, Corexit, into the  atmosphere, and we should be wondering about any mass deaths in the  region.  Nevertheless, this has turned into a global event, so the above  could be a side effect of something larger, or a direct contributing  factor.</p>
<p><strong>Government testing:</strong> The long history of government testing has   been exposed by many <a href="http://www.infowars.com/is-mass-bird-and-fish-die-off-connected-to-government-testing/">researchers</a>.   The strange component to this die-off   is that only certain species  have been affected, but within the entire  region.  And some reports  have indicated that the organs of these birds  were liquefied, which  could indicate a possible virus. Could this implicate  species-specific  bio-weapons? It is on record that discussions have  taken place about <a href="http://www.peace.ca/racetargetablebioweapons.htm">race-specific bio-weapons</a>; perhaps this is a test of delivery capability?</p>
<div><a href="http://activistpost.net/organicfood.html" target="_blank"> </a></div>
<p><strong>GMO mutation:</strong> Mike Adams of Natural News sets forth an <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/030914_dead_fish_birds.html">interesting theory</a>:  this latest event is local, but the die-offs are happening across  species as bee populations and bats are also declining.  Adams points  out that Monsanto has a corporate office in Arkansas.  Just wondering.</p>
<p><strong>Geoengineering:</strong> Could spraying in the area have caused this type  of fallout?  Perhaps something new added to the mixture? Chemtrails have  quickly moved from conspiracy theory to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-World-Are-They-Spraying/dp/B00483VQTE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=permacultucom-20&amp;link_code=btl&amp;camp=213689&amp;creative=392969" target="_blank">documented fact</a>.   So much so, that the powers-that-be have had to admit to the program,  but a beneficial one in their view.  Between cloud seeding and possible  connections to HAARP, chemtrail fallout must be considered, especially  as it is being conducted nearly worldwide.  Rosalind Peterson has been  at the forefront of <a href="http://www.agriculturedefensecoalition.org/?q=agriculture">connecting geoengineering to GMOs</a> as a combined source for oxygen-depleting algae blooms that very well  could affect a wide spectrum of natural systems. Furthermore, some  believe that the delivery system for chemtrails can also disperse  pathogens.  If there is a flu or disease outbreak in the coming days or  weeks among the human population in areas where the birds have fallen,  the chemtrail connection could be made.  If this happens, the contagion  could be blamed on a new, deadly bird flu.  A last possibility connected  to chemtrails would be nanoparticles.</p>
<p><strong>HAARP:</strong> Birds and fish can be susceptible to subtle frequency  alteration.  An interesting YouTube post from a long-time fisherman  mentioned the <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/01/why-drum-fish-in-arkansas-are-effected.html">&#8220;pearl&#8221; plate</a> behind the eye of the affected type of drum fish in this event.  He  made a plea for anyone in the area to look for signs of damage to this  plate.  Both birds and fish navigate in highly coordinated ways that  indicate that they move and communicate via frequencies.  Could the <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/08/weather-wars-and-devils-haarp.html">HAARP array in Alaska</a> have short-circuited their navigation systems?  Or, perhaps this is the  beginning of a cascading effect from decades of electromagnetic  pollution emanating from EMF and ELF waves shot around the planet via a  wide range of modern communications.</p>
<p><strong>Scalar Weapons: </strong>These directed energy beam weapons can be deployed via satellite and create a wide range of &#8220;natural disasters&#8221; that can be <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/2056635-experts-suspect-scalar-weapons-testing-caused-mass-bird-and-fish-deaths">tuned to certain frequencies</a>.   Their radius is reported to be several miles.  Even crazier is that we  have been told that the dead birds encountered massive trauma.  One of  the reported abilities of scalar weapons is to create a <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/oz/cv/scalarweapons.html">Tesla shield</a> of plasma, like a bubble, that could explode anything that enters its  airspace.  Some have speculated that this technology is in full  operation.  But what if it truly is still at the testing phase?   Remember, this is <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2011/01/thousands-of-birds-fall-dead-in-south.html">happening in South America</a>, too.</p>
<p><strong>Project Blue Beam:</strong> Were they testing a sound generator for the  global theater of alien invasion?  This one is &#8220;out there&#8221; for sure, but  NASA itself has announced its preparation for such a scenario. <a href="http://www.wariscrime.com/2009/01/18/news/project-blue-beam-step-one-economic-disaster/">Project Blue Beam</a>,  like its counterpart HAARP, uses the natural energy present in the  ionosphere as both a visual and acoustical device.  Again, perhaps they  are not at the ready stage yet, but, <a href="http://prometheus.al.ru/english/phisik/onichelson/tunguska.htm">like Tesla</a>, have made an unintentional misstep.</p>
<p><strong>Geomagnetic and other Earth changes:</strong> As anyone can see from the  above range of possibilities, we are facing an array of human  tampering.  However, the backdrop to this are the anomalies beginning to  take form with the apparent wandering of our magnetic pole, as even <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/12/091224-north-pole-magnetic-russia-earth-core.html">National Geographic reported</a> that the north magnetic pole is racing toward Russia.  Add to this a dwindling magnetosphere and <a href="http://www.earthfrenzyradio.com/planet-in-peril/stunned-scientists-warn-of-dwindling-oxygen.html">falling oxygen levels</a>, and the deaths among more delicate species might portend a larger problem.  Finally, an increase in sun activity and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/magnetic/animals.html">magnetic storms</a> might be weakening our overall natural habitat.</p>
<p>The widespread die-off of nature should lead us to look more intently at  the world around us, and to question our relationship to it, and our  effect upon it. Perhaps this is what we should have been doing all  along.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/WeaponsOfMassDeception3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/WeaponsOfMassDeception2.jpg" alt="Deception" /></a>Lenin (Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov)  said, “The establishment of a central bank is 90% of communizing a  nation.” <sup>1</sup> Worldwide control obviously requires extraordinary  organization, superior weaponry and high technology (like HAARP), political  power and monopoly control of all the resources. On February 17, 1950,  James P. Warburg declared to the U.S. Senate, “We shall have World  Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether  World Government will be achieved by <strong><em>conquest</em></strong> or <strong><em> consent</em></strong>.” <sup>2</sup> In Russia and China and other countries,  the elite used thugs for their violent <strong><em>conquest</em></strong> of existing  leaders.</p>
<p>Populations wouldn’t knowingly <strong><em> consent </em></strong>to their own demise. But distracted, naïve, ignorant  citizens, by their <strong><em>consent</em></strong>, relinquish their liberties  by placing their trust in others, (1) two-faced lying politicians who  have abandoned the constitution and sold their souls and, (2) the persuasive  profit-driven elite media. Smiling talking heads and brilliant, fast-talking  female lawyers in low-cut garments legitimize immodesty while peddling  infotainment disguised as news. They equivocate among themselves over  the Neocon’s next war target which they claim is necessary to keep  America safe. While selling their illusions and building our perceptions,  what to wear, eat, drink, think and who to fear, they conceal, suppress  or gloss over stories that are actually pertinent to our lives.</p>
<p>Jacob H. Schiff, Paul Warburg  and other bankers influenced Congress to pass the Federal Reserve Act  (December 23, 1913). The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was created in  October 1913 to minimize predictable criticism. The bankers have manufactured  panics, withdrawn credit and in the process have confiscated the citizen’s  resources and personal property through phony bailouts, sanctioned by  compromised politicians. These actions are calculated and designed to  ultimately decimate the economy. The same bankers who promoted the Federal  Reserve funded Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Molotov and  Kirov (assumed names) in their godless, violent take-over of Russia.  The bankers began making major profits when Bernard Baruch, Louis Brandeis  and others manipulated their puppet Woodrow Wilson into entering World  War I on borrowed money after the provoked attack on the <em>Lusitania</em>.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill, a Rothschild  minion, referred to the Americans traveling on the ill-fated <em>Lusitania</em> as “live bait,” a tactic for involving the U.S. in World War I,  which started the flow of money from the pockets of U.S. citizens into  the vaults of Rothschild and his fellow bankers. The “live bait”  tactic had been successfully used with the deaths of American sailors  aboard the <em>USS Maine</em>.<em> </em> Banker-backed corporate moguls exploited the situation. Their political  puppets then ordered the military to invade the resource-rich Philippines.  Meanwhile, the media vilified and dehumanized the innocent Filipinos  so that the invaders could rationalize killing them. Mogul minions followed  up by gathering cheap labor to extract resources and the government  seized land to build military bases to manage the population and protect  the resources.<br />
To legitimize propaganda for World War I, Walter Lippmann persuaded  President Wilson to create the official Committee on Public Information  (CPI) on April 13, 1917. Wilson appointed newspaper publisher, George  Creel, as chairman. Creel commissioned the nation’s artists to produce  paintings, posters and cartoons to promote the war. With the expert  help of Edward Bernays, “the father of public relations” and a nephew  of Sigmund Freud, the CPI manufactured the most atrocious hate propaganda  against the Germans. Bernays manipulated public opinion through crowd  psychology, his uncle Sigmund’s specialty. Creel had a staff of persuasive  wordsmiths – journalists, writers, intellectuals and many advertisers  – who later admitted they were willing to lie, use emotional appeal  and enemy demonization to generate hate and fear to elicit support for  the war. <sup>3</sup><br />
In anticipation of entering another war, on July 11, 1941, President  Roosevelt created the Office of Coordinator of Information (COI), and  appointed William J. Donovan, a millionaire Wall Street lawyer, as its  head. <sup>4</sup> Communist apologist Eleanor Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie,  George Field, Dorothy Thompson, Herbert Bayard Swope, and prominent  journalists, academics, trade unionists, theologians, and public officials  founded Freedom House, a CFR front, in October 1941. FDR encouraged  the group’s covert propaganda activities as he hoped it would persuade  U.S. citizens to accept entry into World War II. Freedom House was also  instrumental in facilitating and supporting post-war policies like the  Marshall Plan, NATO, and the UN. <sup>5</sup> The Marshall Plan transferred  U.S. tax dollars into the hands of the elite, camouflaged as a humanitarian  effort. U.S. taxpayers rebuilt bombed-out foreign countries with the  stipulation that the money be spent with banker-backed U.S. companies  who raised their prices for those foreign customers.</p>
<p>The U.S. embargoed Japan, which  depended on imports, to provoke a military response. Churchill and Roosevelt,  whose governments had broken the Japanese communication codes, then  monitored the progress of Japan’s military expedition to Pearl Harbor  where unwary military personnel, “live bait,” 2,402 people  were killed on December 7, 1941. After Japan’s retaliatory attack,  the media vilified and dehumanized them. The U.S. government, urged  by California farmers, also forcibly relocated and interned 110,000  Japanese Americans, mostly west coast farmers who typically sold their  produce more competitively than the Caucasians. The government put the  Japanese in detention camps and froze all of their assets. At least  80,000 of those individuals had been born in America.</p>
<p>On June 13, 1942, after the  U.S. entered the war, the COI’s propaganda department joined the new  Office of War Information (OWI) and was renamed the Office of Strategic  Services (OSS) still under Donovan’s direction. <sup>6</sup> The OSS  developed worldwide clandestine capability and employed almost 13,000  men and women. <sup>7</sup> It conducted psychological warfare, often  used by governments to marshal the troops for warfare. This included  constant repetition of fabricated atrocity stories to prove that the  enemy was evil and had to be eliminated. <sup>8</sup></p>
<p>In 1942, the State Department  and CFR members collaborated to set up a new “supranational organization”  to replace the League of Nations, based on Wilson’s internationalist  ideas. <sup>9</sup> Secretary of State Cordell Hull (CFR) asked Communist  Alger Hiss to assemble a group of fourteen other CFR members to draft  the United Nations Charter (UN). <sup>10</sup> The UN Charter displaced  the U.S. Constitution with little response from the voters who were  traumatized by Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. U.S. Senators accepted  the charter without even viewing a copy. They were not authorized to  bind U.S. citizens, without their consent, to the conditions of the  U.N. charter. <sup>11</sup> Stalin would join the allies only if the  U.S. would accept the UN. On April 12, 1952, Secretary Dulles would  claim, “Treaty law can override the Constitution. Treaties can take  powers away from Congress and give them to the President.” <sup>12</sup></p>
<p>Truman suspended OSS operations  on October 1, 1945. Its leaders, trained personnel and assets were ultimately  transferred into the newly created Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  via the National Security Act, July 26, 1947. Among the transferees  to the CIA were four future CIA Directors, Allen Dulles, Richard Helms,  William Colby, and William Casey. The CIA, created and staffed by the  elite, is a worldwide organization to perpetrate covert terrorist activities.  It has links to Britain’s MI6 and to the Israeli Mossad. Truman  struggled to regularize the CIA’s psychological warfare, one of the  agency’s greatest propaganda triumphs. <sup>13</sup></p>
<p>The CIA’s activities, per  the official government directive, included the following, propaganda;  economic warfare; preventive direct action, including industrial sabotage,  demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states,  including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrilla  and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist  or now anti-nationalist elements in countries around the world. Such  operations should not include armed conflict by recognized military  forces, espionage, counter-espionage, and cover and deception for military  operations.” <sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Presidents Truman and Eisenhower  introduced and mobilized propaganda as an official <em>peacetime</em> practice. Gun-toting dictators make demands but democracies use propaganda  to persuade citizens to accept ideas, points of view, or policy positions  as if the communication were immediately or ultimately their own. <sup> 15</sup> Truman established the Psychological Strategy Board,  as part of the CIA, on April 4, 1951 with Gordon Gray (CFR) as the first  Director. Henry Kissinger, a Harvard professor, was Gray’s consultant. <sup> 16</sup> The CIA published and disseminated hundreds of books promoting  the official Cold War party line. A CIA-backed, worldwide media network  provided cover for their agents and allowed the distribution of misinformation  that predictably spread to the U.S. via the wire services, which also  employed CIA agents who prevented problematic facts from gaining public  exposure. <sup>17</sup></p>
<p>Frank Wisner, along with Allen  Dulles, Richard Helms and Phillip Graham (publisher of <em>The Washington  Post</em> and husband of CFR/Trilateralist Katharine Graham) established  Operation Mockingbird, the CIA program designed to control the U.S.  media. <sup>18</sup> For decades U.S. “news” has been fabricated.  In 1981, CIA Director William Casey said, “We’ll know our disinformation  program is complete when everything the American public believes is  false.”</p>
<p>In 1948, according to John  F. Kennedy, many of Truman’s supporters abandoned him because he supported  the Morgenthau Plan and other questionable issues. On his whistle-stop  campaign train during the presidential race, an avid U.S. Zionist delivered  a suitcase containing $2 million in cash which gave him the financial  boost he needed to win in what was considered the greatest election  upset in U.S. history. <sup>19</sup> Truman believed, as a result of  the Holocaust, that Jews were oppressed and deserved a homeland. The  British relinquished the problem of a shared Arab-Jewish state to the  UN on April 2, 1947 because of Jewish terrorism in Palestine. President  Truman instructed a reluctant State Department to endorse the UN’s  partition plan of November 29, 1947. At midnight on May 14, 1948, Israel’s  Provisional Government announced the new State of Israel. On that same  day, like Roosevelt’s recognition of the Soviet government, Truman  officially recognized the Zionist government in Palestine against the  advice of many people. Truman didn’t bother to tell leading State  Department officials who became angry when they heard about it. On May  15, 1948, the Arab states responded by invading Israel which began the  first Arab-Israeli war. <sup>20</sup> Zionists held only 7% of the land  when they proclaimed their state. After Truman’s recognition, public  relations experts started promoting the phrase “Judeo-Christian”  to help establish America’s “special relationship” with Israel.</p>
<p>Dwight D. Eisenhower was president  of Columbia University (1948–1953) just before he was installed as  U.S. president. Bernard Baruch first met the like-minded Eisenhower  in 1928. Rockefeller and Morgan agents and numerous CFR members backed  Eisenhower, a womanizing scoundrel, in the presidential election in  1952. After his nomination he told the President of the United Synagogue  of America, “The Jewish people could not have a better friend than  me …I grew up believing that Jews was the chosen people and that they  gave us the high ethical and moral principles of our civilization.” <sup> 21</sup> He accommodated the OSS in their covert assassination of General  George S. Patton <sup>22</sup> who opposed the Morgenthau Plan and Eisenhower’s  death camps and was going to reveal Eisenhower’s close collaboration  with the Soviets. Eisenhower halted the U.S. troops in order to allow  the Soviets to “liberate” Berlin. Ilya Ehrenburg, the head of Soviet  propaganda directed the Soviet troops to ravage and rape the German  women. At least 50,000 and perhaps as many as 100,000 females of every  age were savagely raped; many of them were tortured and killed. <sup> 23</sup></p>
<p>By 1953, the CIA had 7,200  people working on covert actions, activities that took 74% of the CIA’s  yearly budget. <sup>24</sup> The CIA always recruited their leaders  from the elite class – businessmen, credible journalists, Ivy League  scholars and Wall Street lawyers and bankers. Irving Kristol, Paul Weyrich,  William Simon, Richard Mellon Scaife, Frank Shakespeare, and William  F. Buckley, Jr. were connected to the CIA.</p>
<p>George Washington, in his farewell  address, advised Americans to avoid an “unnatural connection with  any foreign power” and “to have with them as little political connection  as possible.” <sup>25</sup> Apparently, future leaders ignored that  advice. By June 1953, the U.S. government had given Israel $293,000,000  with an additional of $200,000,000 as Export-Import bank loans. The <em> New York Herald-Tribune</em> of March 12, 1953 reported that, in the  first five years of Israel’s existence, including gifts, the total  amounted to $1,000,000,000. This was in addition to the money they extracted  from Germany. <sup>26</sup></p>
<p>Beginning in 1953, Irving Kristol  (CFR), “the godfather of neo-Conservatism,” and a former Trotskyite  (opposed Stalin’s focus on Russia in preference of a worldwide system),  co-edited the magazine <em>Encounter</em>, published in London and financed  by the CIA. It was the voice of the CIA-funded Congress for Cultural  Freedom and regularly promoted Fabian Socialism and the Labour Party.  Kristol was also the editor of <em>Commentary</em> (1947-1952) and the  editor of <em>The Reporter</em> (1959-1960). Kristol moved his family  back to the U.S. by 1960. Daniel Bell (CFR) and Kristol founded <em>The</em> <em> Public Interest </em>(1965-2002), a publication of Freedom House, under  the direction of George Field, its executive director. Field was also  chairman of the RAND School for Social Science which was owned by the  American Socialist Society and financed by the Garland Fund. Both Bell  and Kristol were subsidized by the CIA, through the Congress for Cultural  Freedom, the same organization that funded some of Gloria Steinem’s  social engineering activities. Bell worked for Henry Luce (S&amp;B,  CFR) and advocated the dissolution of all borders and local governments.</p>
<p>Irving Kristol founded and  published <em>The National Interest</em> (1985-2002). He was a fellow  of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American  Enterprise Institute and a John M. Olin Distinguished Fellow (1988-1999).  He contributed a monthly column to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (1972-1997).  He served on the Council of the National Endowment for the Humanities  (1972- 1977). From the 1950s forward, chaos, in various strategic places,  has reigned, perpetrated primarily by the CIA in conjunction with foreign  intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>In 1954, Secretary of State  John Foster Dulles ordered the CIA’s Saigon Military Mission (SMM)  to engage in guerrilla warfare operations in Vietnam. Dulles told these  “agent provocateurs” to “raise hell.” <sup>27</sup> The turmoil  was then blamed on the local citizens, who were now referred to as the  insurgency. CIA Director Allen Dulles assigned Edward Lansdale and his  CIA cohort Lucien Conein, to engage in unconventional warfare in Vietnam  where they created the Vietnam Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG). <sup> 28</sup> In June 1954, the SMM established a campaign of undercover  military and psychological warfare. They had unlimited U.S. taxpayer  dollars and engaged in political, psychological and terrorist activities  against the native population in the northern regions, especially in  Hanoi and in the surrounding Tonkin area. They polluted petroleum supplies,  sabotaged the railroad, tried to destroy the largest printing business  in the North, bombed the post offices, and distributed millions of propaganda  leaflets to incite fear and vast amounts of counterfeit money which  created calculated inflation. <sup>29</sup></p>
<p>When the Tonkinese villagers,  mostly Catholic, were sufficiently frightened and intimidated, the CIA  offered to transport them from the north to the south. The CIA manipulated  the Catholic hierarchy who then urged thousands of Catholics to evacuate. <sup> 30</sup> Those resistant to relocation were told that the U.S. was going  to use the atomic bomb on them if a civil war erupted between the north  and the south. <sup>31</sup> Weapons and agents were left in the north  with an abundance of CIA-supplied counterfeit currency to continue the  economic destabilization. <sup>32</sup><br />
Tens of thousands of the terrorized citizens fled on foot. The CIA transported  the remainder via their Civil Air Transport Airlines (CAT) and U.S.  Navy ships at a cost of about $100 million. The Catholics were moved  into a predominately Buddhist population which intentionally created  religious, civil, and economic strife. <sup>33</sup> The CIA and the  Mossad are expert in population relocation in order to provoke civil  and religious strife. The deliberate decimation of Mexico’s peso in  the mid 1990s (and Bush’s de facto North American Union) created an  influx of desperate Mexicans into the U.S, in conjunction with the drug  cartel’s operations. Zionists expelled 750,000 Palestinians from their  homeland in 1948; forced another 350,000 to flee Gaza in 1967 and forced  another 147,000 Syrians from the Golan Heights in order to repopulate  the areas, without compensation. Of course, the media suppresses these  terrorist activities. Also, U.S. warfare in the Middle East caused thousands  of dispossessed Muslims to flee elsewhere. This ongoing clash of cultures,  the foreign incursion into America’s diminishing economy and deindustrialization  (by corporate outsourcing for cheaper labor) creates tension. The media  incites religious and economic outrage while concealing the cause and  effect activities of the real culprits who prey on all of us.</p>
<p>In 1954, Israeli agents working  under cover planted bombs in several Egyptian buildings, including a  U.S. facility. The Israelis were trying to flip U.S. support of Egypt  to Israel. So they planted evidence implicating the Arabs. However,  one of the bombs detonated prematurely. The Egyptians captured one of  the culprits who revealed the identities of the other members of the  Israeli espionage group, some of whom were from Israel and others were  local Jews. Often Israelis move to other countries, hold dual citizenship,  and engage in dubious activities while working in government positions  and other influential positions, in opposition to the best interests  of the host country. The Israeli media immediately denied all culpability  and claimed that it was a scam perpetrated by “anti-Semites,” a  convenient oft-used ruse to silence justifiable criticism. However,  in a subsequent trial, individuals produced clear-cut evidence that  proved Israeli involvement in the bombing. Top Israelis blamed Israel’s  Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon; he resigned. The operation is known as  the Lavon Affair or Operation Susannah. Regarding anti-semitism, Norman  G. Finkelstein wrote, “The new anti-Semitism actually incorporates  three main components: (1) exaggeration and fabrication, (2) mislabeling  legitimate criticism of Israeli policy, and (3) the unjustified yet  predictable spillover from criticism of Israel to Jews generally.” <sup> 34</sup></p>
<p>On December 11, 1955, the Syrians  captured five Israeli soldiers who were in the process of installing  a wiretapping apparatus on the Syrian telephone network. The Israeli’s  version of the event was that the five men had been abducted in Israel  and taken to Syria and tortured. Public opinion was skewed in Israel  and in the West in favor of Israel. By then, Israel had diverted the  flow of the Jordan River at the expense of the area’s other inhabitants.  On October 1, 1955, the U.S. government, through the CIA, gave Israel  the “green light” to attack Egypt.  <sup>35</sup></p>
<p>I was in Israel in 1999 when  our group received special permission to visit a specific site on the  Jordan River which was little more than a tiny stream of putrid water.  It was, at that time, guarded by several gun-totting Israeli soldiers.  Our tour group was repeatedly warned not to discuss Christianity with  any Israeli citizen as they have disdain for Christians. According to  the Talmud (Traditions of the Elders), Jesus led Israel astray; his  mother Mary was an adulterer and a whore and Jesus is in hell, in boiling  excrement. The Talmud states that Christians will also be in hell for  eternity in “boiling excrement” if they oppose “Judaism.” Jewish  sages encourage their followers to daily recite the following “Blessed be thou who hast not made me a  goy.” <sup>36</sup> Goy  is a negative term for gentile; some say it means cattle.</p>
<p>In October  1960, just prior to the presidential election, John F. Kennedy visited  with his good friend, Charles Bartlett, a journalist. The previous evening,  Kennedy had been the dinner guest of an elite group of wealthy, influential  Jews at the New York home of Abraham Feinberg, chairman of the American  Bank and Trust Company. Their spokesman told Kennedy that they recognized  that his campaign was in financial difficulty. The group then offered  significant financial help if Kennedy as president “would allow them  to set the course of Middle East policy over the next four years.” <sup> 37</sup></p>
<p>Bartlett recalled,  “He said if he ever did get to be president, he would push for a law  that would subsidize presidential campaigns out of the U.S. Treasury.  He added that whatever the cost of this subsidy, it would insulate future  presidential candidates from this kind of pressure and save the country  a lot of grief in the long run.” Congressman Paul Findley (1961-1982)  inquired further and discovered that Adlai E. Stevenson had a similar  experience in 1956. <sup>38</sup></p>
<p>Findley wrote,  “Ethnic group pressure is an ever-present part of U.S. partisan politics,  and because the president of the United States is the executor of all  foreign policy, and the formulator of most of it, pressures naturally  center on the people who hold or seek the presidency. When the pressure  is from friends of Israel, presidents—and presidential candidates—often  yield.” <sup>39</sup> This has been the case since Truman’s presidency  (1945–1953). Condoleezza Rice once said, “We have an Israel-centric  foreign policy.” Regarding Iraq, Findley said, “Our forces invaded  because Israel wanted us to topple Saddam. Two religious communities  – one consisting of a combination of secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews  and the other of misguided Christian fundamentalists – control U.S.  Middle East policies.” <sup>40</sup></p>
<p>By 1977, <em>Washington Post </em> journalist Carl Bernstein said that over 400 journalists, distinguished  reporters and foreign correspondents were CIA employees. A high-level  source told Bernstein, “One journalist is worth twenty agents.”  Pulitzer Prize winner Arthur Schlesinger, a former OSS agent transferred  to the CIA. <sup>41</sup> The CIA, before 1990, paid college professors  to write at least 1,200 propagandistic, anti-Communist books about places  like the Soviet Union, Vietnam, China, Cuba and the Congo. <sup>42</sup> Columbia University, along with other schools, is a CIA recruiting ground.  The Communists recruited Whittaker Chambers when he was there.</p>
<p>Prior to 1967, Islamic fundamentalism  was a relatively small movement. Osama bin Laden, supported by the CIA,  headed the al Qaeda network. Al Qaeda, referred to as the database,  was part of a CIA operation after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan  on December 24, 1979, part of Columbia professor Zbigniew Brzezinski’s  plan to destabilize the Soviet Union. Brzezinski (CFR), the founding  Director of the Trilateral Commission and a Rockefeller minion with  CIA ties as early as 1959, was President Carter’s National Security  Advisor (1977-1981). By 1984, the CIA supplied textbooks for Afghan  students through USAID, a CIA front group. The textbooks were written  under the direction of Dr. Thomas Gouttierre, head of Afghanistan Studies  at the University of Nebraska where the books were published. Dr. Gouttierre  is friends with Zalmay Khalilzad (CFR), U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan  and Iraq (2003). Khalilzad, an Afghan-born Muslim was a former adviser  to Unocal and was an Assistant Political Science Professor at Columbia  University (1979-1986) where he worked closely with Brzezinski.</p>
<p>The textbooks were designed  to create a militaristic populace in order to provoke resistance to  the Soviets and future enemies. The book’s illustrations included  tanks, land mines and missiles and promoted hatred. <sup>43</sup> The  U.S. supplied these incendiary textbooks (1984-1994) under Presidents  Reagan and George H. W. Bush (S&amp;B). Bush was Vice President under  Reagan (1981-1989). All CIA records regarding Bush and his company,  Zapata covering 1960 to 1966 were destroyed when he became vice president  in 1981. Bush was CIA director (1976-1977).</p>
<p>In 1982, President Reagan created  the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) in order to acceptably manage  CIA activities. Freedom House, the group created in 1941, became a part  of this network. NED helped to finance Freedom House. Paul Wolfowitz,  in the early 1980s, along with his neoconservative allies, collaborated  with numerous Trotskyites. With the hidden funding and under the cover  of conservative think tanks, the U.S. government can influence the public  and conceal its interventions in foreign politics.</p>
<p>At least six million people  had perished by 1987 as a result of the CIA’s covert operations. Not  only is the CIA not an intelligence agency, it distorts information  and perpetuates misinformation and disinformation to justify its own  goals. This wide-range deception has resulted in organized terrorism  throughout the world. Using the CIA, our government routinely dismisses  or ignores national and international laws under the guise of “national  security.” <sup>44</sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, alarm over Islamic  fundamentalism actually occurred at about the same time that Reagan  called for the dismantlement of the Berlin Wall, formally concluded  on October 3, 1990, followed by the official collapse of the Soviet  Union on December 25, 1991. With Soviet Communism gone and the Berlin  Wall dismantled, the State Department would either be forced to create  another enemy or decrease their defense budget to about half of what  it had been which would really cut into the elite’s profits. Shortly  thereafter, the first Gulf War was devised to purportedly protect the  oil resources of the Middle East against so-called “rogue states and  nuclear outlaws.” <sup>45</sup> Islamic fundamentalism, our latest  enemy, replaced Communism.</p>
<p>Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf (CFR<strong>)</strong>,  the man behind the proposed Muslim community center two blocks from  ground zero, came to the U.S. with his family in 1965. In 1997 he founded  the American Society for Muslim Advancement (ASMS), a tax-exempt foundation.  Its mission statement states, “We collaborate with other faith-based  organizations to build relationships of trust through dialogue and education,  honoring the diversity of faiths, sharing commonalities, and celebrating  differences.” <sup>46</sup> Interestingly, ASMS is funded by the Rockefeller  Brothers; the Carnegie Corporation of New York; Rockefeller Philanthropy;  Rockefeller Brothers Fund; Global Fund for Women; The Russell Family  Foundation; Danny Kaye &amp; Sylvia Fine Foundation; Graham Charitable  Foundation; Henry Luce Foundation; Hunt Alternatives; The Ms. Foundation  and other elite tax-exempt foundations. <sup>47</sup> The people who  sign the check determine the policy. Are all of these people on the  same team, playing the public and causing controlled conflict?</p>
<p>In 1972, Gloria Steinem (CIA  agent extraordinaire), Patricia Carbine, Letty Cottin Pogrebin and Marlo  Thomas founded The Ms. Foundation. <sup>48</sup> Steinem’s social  engineering activities led to Roe v. Wade. Pogrebin authored <em>In Defense  of the Law of Return</em> for <em>The Nation</em> on December 22, 2003,  a law passed in Israel on July 5, 1950 which grants any Jew automatic  citizenship. <sup>49</sup> Pogrebin, a financial contributor to Obama  since 2004, <sup>50</sup> is a member of Americans for Peace Now (APN)  the most prominent American Jewish Zionist organization working to achieve  a comprehensive political settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. <sup> 51</sup></p>
<p>Former Harvard professor, William  “Bill” Kristol, the son of Irving Kristol, was Chief of Staff  to Vice President Dan Quayle, under the first Bush regime. Bill Kristol  founded the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), a tax-exempt  foundation, in the spring of 1997, the same year that Rauf founded the  ASMS. PNAC, with close ties to the American Enterprise Institute, was  funded by the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the John M. Olin Foundation and  the Bradley Foundation. Its objectives are U.S. Global supremacy and  a “Greater Israel.” Twenty-five people signed their mission statement,  seventeen of whom belong to the CFR, whose objective is a one-world  government. Founding members include Elliott Abrams (CFR), Gary Bauer,  William J. Bennett (Irving Kristol’s protégé), Jeb Bush, Richard  B. Cheney (CFR), Eliot A. Cohen (CFR), Midge Decter (CFR), Paula Dobriansky  (CFR), Steve Forbes, Aaron Friedberg (CFR), Francis Fukuyama (CFR),  Frank Gaffney, Fred C. Ikle (CFR), Donald Kagan (CFR), Zalmay Khalilzad  (CFR), I. Lewis Libby (CFR), Norman B. Podhoretz (CFR), Dan Quayle,  Peter W. Rodman (CFR), Stephen P. Rosen (CFR), Henry S. Rowen (CFR),  Donald Rumsfeld, Vin Weber (CFR), George Weigel (CFR), and Paul Wolfowitz  (CFR). In 1992 Libby and Wolfowitz wrote <em>Defense Planning Guidance</em> for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.</p>
<p>Bill Kristol, advocates neoconservatism,  the American version of Trotsky’s Bolshevism. Kristol, a Bilderberger,  a Manhattan Institute trustee, is also the editor and co-founder, along  with John Podhoretz, of the <em>Weekly Standard Magazine</em>, established  September 17, 1995 and funded, at a loss, by Rupert Murdoch (CFR), a  Zionist. This so-called conservative magazine, co-edited by Fred Barnes,  promotes the warhawk mentality, the same message heard on numerous “conservative”  talk shows and on Murdoch’s Fox Network. <em>Weekly Standard</em> contributors  include Joseph Epstein, Charles Krauthammer (CFR), Brit Hume, a Fulbright  scholar, <sup>52</sup> Tucker Carlson, Robert W. Kagan (CFR) foreign  policy analyst and son of Donald Kagan (CFR), Yale Professor John Podhoretz  (son of Norman Podhoretz) and others. In 1995 Kristol confessed to the <em> New Yorker</em>: “The liberal media were never that powerful, and the  whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative  failures.” <sup>53</sup> See a video on PNAC <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6955499574153814555" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a> (warning: language).</p>
<p>Norman B. Podhoretz (CFR), a Trotskyite, in his books has admitted that the  reason for the Cold War was to weaponize Israel to fight the Arab nations.  He belongs to the influential New York chapter of the American Jewish  Committee, one of the leading Zionist organizations operating within  the U.S. It publishes the “liberal-turned-conservative” <em>Commentary </em> magazine. <sup>54</sup> Kagan is a columnist for the <em>Washington Post</em> which was associated with the CIA’s Operation Mockingbird. He is a  senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and  wrote <em>Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World  Order</em>.</p>
<p>Now, remembering that the CIA  probably controls much of what we hear from the elite-owned media, according  to Pew, 30% of all Americans obtain their news from talk radio and cable  television – many never read a book. A large percentage get their  “news” from the Fox Network whose employees receive the morning  memo, a directive on how to spin the “news” of the day. Roger  Ailes, former Republican campaign wizard, is president of Fox News Channel  and chairman of the Fox Television Stations Group which has a throng  of “journalists” and guests who push right-wing propaganda  disguised as news. <sup>55</sup> According to a decision by the Florida  Appeals Court on February 14, 2003 in the Jane Akre whistleblower lawsuit,  the court agreed with Fox News that it is not against the law to distort  or falsify the news in the U.S. <sup>56</sup></p>
<p>In 1997, Israël Shahak wrote,  “Since the spring of 1992, public opinion in Israel is being prepared  for the prospect of a war with Iran, to be fought to bring about Iran’s  total military and political defeat. In one version, Israel would attack  Iran alone; in another it would ‘persuade’ the West to do the job.” <sup> 57</sup> On January 26, 1998, the PNAC warhawks, in a <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">letter</span></a> to President Clinton, urged him to  invade Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>In October 1998, the Catastrophic  Terrorism Study Group completed a nine-month long study of the “technologies  and defenses” against terrorists. The study group was a collaboration  of the faculty of Harvard, MIT, Stanford and the University of Virginia.  It was funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the John D. and  Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the Herbert S. Winokur Public  Policy Fund at Harvard University. The group produced a report entitled: <em> Catastrophic Terrorism: Elements of a National Policy</em>. <sup>58</sup> An article based on the academic Study Group report appeared in the  CFR journal <em>Foreign Affairs</em> in the November-December 1998 issue,  the same year that PNAC wrote to President Clinton suggesting the removal  of Hussein.<br />
The project director was Philip D. Zelikow, later the gatekeeper executive  director of the 9/11 Commission. He earlier co-authored a book with  Condoleezza Rice (both members of Bush 41’s National Security Council)  entitled <em>Germany Unified and Europe Transformed</em>: <em>A Study in  Statecraft.</em> Zelikow also authored <em>The National Security Strategy  of the United States</em> which became the new preemptive war doctrine  of the Bush administration written for then National Security Council  Director, Condoleezza Rice who had worked on the Bush transition team.  He had a hidden agenda – connect al Qaeda and Iraq. <sup>59</sup></p>
<p>PNAC’s policy statements  were compiled in <em>Rebuilding America’s Defenses,  Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century</em>, published in September  2000.</p>
<p>We read, “Further, the process  of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely  to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event –  like a new Pearl Harbor.” <sup>60</sup> It appears that 9/11 was that  new Pearl Harbor. As Shahak indicated, Israel was going to persuade  the West to wage war. Just how would Israeli political leaders “persuade”  the U.S. to invade their enemy, a country that has not militarily assaulted  the U.S.? The elite, for over 100 years, has used false flag assaults  and very pervasive media propaganda to win public support for their  warfare. The CIA and their foreign intelligence counterpart, the Mossad,  have lengthy experience in false flag tactics, the actual reason for  their existence. At least two previous incidents, probably more, involved  Israel.<br />
On June 8, 1967, there was a failed attempt to use the “live bait”  device, with government foreknowledge, with the <em>USS Liberty. </em> The Zionist owned U.S. media kept quiet about the Israeli attack on  the ship. Then on October 12, 2000, the “live bait” tactic was used  in the <em>USS Cole</em> where seventeen U.S. sailors were killed, and  thirty-nine were injured. A small boat moved to the port side of the  destroyer when all the sailors were gathering in the galley for lunch.  An explosion occurred which created a 40-by-40-foot hole in the ship.  Al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, a CIA asset, took credit for the attack.  Yet, samples of the explosives retrieved from the ship’s hull showed  that materials used were only available in the U.S. and Israel. Then  the “live bait” tactic was used on 9/11 to get the U.S. to remove  Hussein and bomb Iraq back to the Stone Age.</p>
<p>Within twenty-four hours of  9/11 the media miraculously, as if all the information were prepared  beforehand, revealed histories, photos, and details about the Muslim  terrorists who allegedly perpetrated the attack. Bin Laden, who died  in December 2001, even came back from the dead to claim responsibility. <sup> 61</sup> Fox News announced his death on December 26, 2001. <sup>62</sup> Despite the terrorist’s amazing ability to subvert the military response  apparatus of the world’s most powerful nation, they failed to cover  their trail and left a substantial amount of easy-to-find fireproof  evidence. Their unhindered assault on a specific section of the Defense  Department halted an audit that would have exposed billions of dollars  of stolen money that had been funneled to special friends. The Port  Authority, after it lost a 10-year asbestos lawsuit on May 1, 2001,  were stuck with a money-losing albatross that they couldn’t get a  license to demolish. On July 24, 2001 Eisenberg of the Port Authority  leased the towers to his friend Larry Silverstein. Almost prophetically,  Silverstein quickly insured the towers against a terrorist attack. <sup> 63</sup></p>
<p>On September 20, 2001, PNAC  members sent a letter to President Bush in which they urged him to wage  the nation’s “first war of the 21<sup>st</sup> century” including  the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden, and the capture and prosecution  of any and all perpetrators of 9/11. They encouraged Bush to go after  any other group that means us harm. They advocated the end of Hussein’s  government and the financial and military support of any Iraqi opposition.  They also encouraged him to go after Hezbollah and the countries that  support them, Iran and Syria. If Iran and Syria fail to comply and cooperate  then the U.S. should take action against those countries. They further  recommended that the U.S. withhold support from the Palestinians in  favor of support to Israel. <sup>64</sup></p>
<p>The letter said, “…But <strong><em> even if evidence does not link Iraq</em></strong> directly to the attack,  any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors  must include a determined effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power  in Iraq.” <sup>65</sup> Richard Perle said, “This is total  war. We are fighting a variety of enemies. There are lots of them out  there. All this talk about first we are going to do Afghanistan, then  we will do Iraq, then we take a look around and see how things stand.  This is entirely the wrong way to go about it&#8230; If we just let our  vision of the world go forth, and we embrace it entirely, and we don’t  try to piece together clever diplomacy, but just wage a total war &#8230;  our children will sing great songs about us years from now.” <sup> 66</sup> Paul Wolfowitz said the anti-terrorism campaign has to be broad  and sustained. “It&#8217;s not going to stop if a few criminals are taken  care of.” <sup>67</sup> Iran, another industrial competitor, is the  next war target which brings us back to the subject of Feisal Abdul  Rauf, the individual behind the Manhattan mosque project.</p>
<p>Rauf is a member of the World  Economic Forum’s Council of 100, an organization composed of business,  political, religious, media and opinion leaders that advocates openness  and understanding between the West and Muslim world. <sup>68</sup> Rauf  is also a member of the CFR’s <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/outreach/religioninitiative/advisory_board.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Religious  Advisory Committee</span></a>,  along with Jim Wallis, publisher of <em>Sojourners</em>. He has been an  imam in New York City for twenty-seven years. The building project,  the Cordoba House, a 13-story, $100 million project, is planned as a  community center complete with a swimming pool, culinary school, art  studios and other features. It is to be built on properly zoned, private  property two blocks from ground zero. The city Landmarks Preservation  Commission approved of the construction. However, the American Center  for Law and Justice, founded by Reverend Pat Robertson, filed a lawsuit  in a state court to dispute the commission’s decision. They could  have built the facility, like any other private group, on private property,  without public scrutiny. The media has driven this issue and incited  anger.</p>
<p>Recall that Freedom House was  organized in 1941 to promote World War II. They are still propagandizing.  William Howard Taft IV (S&amp;B, PNAC<sup>69</sup>) is its current chairman.  It is an international non-governmental organization that endorses a  one-world government and opposes all nationalist governments. It has  offices in offices in Algeria, Hungary, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,  Mexico, Uzbekistan, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. Taft supports  the Law of the Sea which places all of the oceans under the jurisdiction  of the UN. Since 1941, the group has developed ties to the CIA, the  Brookings Institution, the U.S. Institute of Peace and other institutions  and government agencies. Freedom House, a propaganda vehicle, is also  a front group for the CFR, the British counterpart of the Royal Institute  of International Affairs. In 2005 Freedom House was receiving U.S. government  funds “for clandestine activities inside Iran.”</p>
<p>The organization receives about  66% of its budget from the U.S. government. <sup>70</sup> See the list  of their board members <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=10" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>. Other financing comes from the Scaife  Family Foundation which finances many groups and individuals, especially  those associated with the CFR, including, Newt Gingrich’s (CFR) GOPAC,  the Federalist Society, the Media Research Center and Joseph Farah’s  World Net Daily – all of which selectively dispense “conservative  views.” The National Endowment for Democracy, a proponent for one  world governance also finances Freedom House. <sup>71</sup></p>
<p>R. James Woolsey (CFR, PNAC)  former CIA Director (1993-1995) was a signatory on the 1998 letter to  President Clinton calling for Hussein’s removal. On September 11,  2001, Woolsey claimed that Iraq was involved in the attack. A year later,  he claimed that Iraq was also involved in the 1993 attack on the World  Trade Center and the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in  Oklahoma City. Woolsey, a former Chairman of Freedom House board (2003-  2005) was a Rhodes Scholar and a Booz Allen Vice President (2002-2008). <sup> 72</sup> He was part of the secretive North American Forum held in Canada,  September 12-14, 2006. <sup>73</sup> In July 2006, Woolsey suggested  that the U.S. bomb Syria. His wife, Suzanne H. Woolsey (CFR), has been  a Director of the Fluor Corp., an engineering and contracting firm since  February 3, 2004. By August 2004, Fluor had a $1.6 billion Iraqi reconstruction  contract. Fluor made about $1.3 billion for reconstruction after Hurricane  Katrina (August 23-29, 2005), <sup>74</sup> a storm (HAARP?) that displaced  1.5 million people and caused about $81.2 billion in damage. On September  26, 2005, Senator Mel Martinez hosted the Halliburton-sponsored “Katrina  Reconstruction Summit” for no-Katrina-victims-need-apply contractors. <sup> 75</sup><br />
Freedom House’s Center for Religious Freedom is now listed on the  Hudson Institute web site. On November 15, 2005, Nina  Shea (CFR), the Director of the Center for Religious Freedom at Freedom  House presented a 19-page <a href="http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/nina_shea_testimony.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">report</span></a> to  the Committee on International Relations of the U.S. House of Representatives  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations.  This report describes the followers of Saudi Arabia’s Wahhabi ideology  and elaborates on the millions of Muslims who have relocated to the  United States. Shea said, “Earlier this year, Freedom House’s Center  for Religious Freedom released a report based on a year-long study of  the radically intolerant Wahhabi ideology contained in documents spread,  published, or otherwise generated by the government of Saudi Arabia  and found in the United States. Extremist Wahhabism is Saudi Arabia’s  state religion; it is also the Saudi government’s aim to propagate  it and have it replace traditional and moderate interpretations of Islam  worldwide, including within the United States.” <sup>76</sup></p>
<p>Another report, <em>Saudi Arabia’s  Curriculum of Intolerance</em>, issued on May 23, 2006, by Freedom House’s  Center for Religious Freedom analyzed the textbooks used by the Saudi  Ministry of Education by their elementary and secondary students. These  textbooks, according to Freedom House, advocate hatred of anyone, including  Muslims, who reject the Wahhabi dogma. The 2006 report was created by  Freedom House’s Center for Religious Freedom which collaborated with  the Washington-based Institute for Gulf Affairs. Their study covered  the textbooks used in Saudi Arabia and Saudi schools outside that country.  The Institute for Gulf Affairs collected the books to be used in the  study from families, teachers, and administrators associated with Saudi  schools. Freedom House then had them translated. <sup>77</sup> Did USAID  have anything to do with these textbooks?</p>
<p>Nina Shea said, “What is  being taught today in Saudi public school textbooks about how Muslims  should relate to other religious communities will poison the minds of  a new generation of Saudis. Whatever changes have been made in the Saudi  educational system, clearly more needs to be done.” The Saudi  government had revised all of their educational materials to eliminate  all intolerant materials. But, according to the Freedom House report,  the textbooks “condemn and denigrate the majority of Sunni Muslims”  who reject the Wahhabi brand of Islam. The report also claims that the  textbooks encourage Muslims to “hate” Christians, Jews and other  “unbelievers.” The Saudi public school system has 25,000 schools,  with about five million students. They also have academies in nineteen  world capitals. One of these is located just outside of Washington in  Alexandria, Virginia. They all use the same religious textbooks. Saudi  Arabia also distributes its textbooks around the world to many Islamic  schools. <sup>78</sup></p>
<p>Barack Obama, as I have <a href="http://www.spingola.com/Barack_Obama_CIA.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">previously written</span></a>, was a CIA asset and attended Columbia  University where Marxist apologist, Zbigniew Brzezinski, taught. Obama  was born (1961), named, mentored, media puffed and financed into the  White House by Soros, Rockefeller and other bankers. According to Wayne  Madsen, Obama’s mother, grandparents and other associates were also  CIA.</p>
<p>Former community organizer,  Barack Hussein Obama, be he Muslim, Christian or a minion for Israel,  is furthering the destruction of the U.S. economy per his agreement  with the bankers when they financed his presidency. Citizens will blame  the Muslim in the White House and take vengeance on U.S. Muslims as  the destabilization continues. Obama, in 2008, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6471073053670305892&amp;ei=e1uaS9PyFYTWqgKblbGGDQ&amp;q=recap+of+aipac+2009+conference&amp;client=opera" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">committed</span></a> his efforts to serving AIPAC’s agenda.  He has links to Wright’s Christian (liberation theology) church in  Chicago and has publicly implied that he is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=tCAffMSWSzY#t=28" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Muslim</span></a>. Is he just a CIA chameleon who alters  his rhetoric for his current audience? Or is this a distracting Psy  Ops designed to distract and divide U.S. citizens while the elite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC5txmlsV_g&amp;feature=related" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">privately</span></a> snicker. He is still a community organizer  but on a much larger scale.</p>
<p>Part of the operation has Republican  Orly Taitz (b. 1960), the Jewish lawyer, dentist, and perhaps Mossad,  along with Philip J. Berg, a Jewish Democrat are publicizing Obama’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwhKuunp8D8&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kenyan birth</span></a>, a detail that was openly announced  in 2004 when he was running for an Illinois senate seat. <sup>79</sup> Taitz emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel in 1981 where she attended  Hebrew University. In 1987 she met and quickly married a software engineer  visiting from California named Yosef Taitz and soon she was in the U.S.  She believes that Israel should “exterminate” the Arabs.   She is associated with AIPAC and believes that Obama’s policies are  “a clear and present danger to Israel.” <sup>80</sup> Ironically,  in regard to the birth issue, Taitz said, “When you allow somebody  with allegiance to other nations to become president, that’s extremely  dangerous.” <sup>81</sup> Good Heavens, save us from the arrogant,  blatant elites and their useful idiots.<br />
That’s true for any political office. Three hundred members (69%)  of the House of Representatives signed a letter addressed to Secretary  of State Clinton affirming “the unbreakable bond” that exists between  the U.S. and the State of Israel. Given that fact, I hardly think that  the imposition of Sharia law is a viable threat. <sup>82</sup> As long  as the “National Menorah” is prominently displayed at the White  House<sup>83</sup> during the holidays instead of a Christian scene,  I think U.S. citizens can be assured that Sharia law is not a threat.</p>
<p>Scientists understand that  monotonous patterns produce a stupor that renders people vulnerable  to hypnosis. Certain low-level frequencies or unperceived waves exist  in radio and television, the normal vehicle for mass hypnosis. It is  the prime method of controlling huge populations. <sup>84</sup> On 9/11,  everything shut down, except our television sets; we were extra attentive  and traumatized, the most effective of any indoctrination process. Many  still believe that Muslims perpetrated 9/11.</p>
<p>Politicians, journalists, and  media personalities are repeatedly expressing outrage over the possible  construction of the Muslim community center two blocks from ground zero.  This attention serves to ignite the emotions that we all felt that day,  conveniently near the anniversary. It serves to re-establish the connection  between 9/11 and the Muslims. It is a psychological operation of the  most organized kind. The government has had almost a decade to reiterate  their deceptive version of the event. Many naïve people, not wanting  to complicate their lives with the horrible reality, believe the government/media’s  first reports – it is easier than acknowledging that they’ve  been so easily deceived.</p>
<p>Former Speaker of the House,  internationalist Newt Gingrich (CFR, NAFTA proponent), a recipient of  millions from Sheldon Adelson, argues, “One of our biggest mistakes  in the aftermath of 9/11 was naming our response to the attacks ‘the  war on terror’ instead of accurately identifying radical Islamists  (and the underlying ideology of radical Islamism) as the target of our  campaign… Radical Islamism is more than simply a religious belief.  It is a comprehensive political, economic, and religious movement that  seeks to impose Sharia—Islamic law—upon all aspects of global society.” <sup> 85</sup><br />
Madeleine Albright (CFR), while Secretary of State, said, “If we have  to use force, it is because we are America. We are the indispensable  nation.” <sup>86</sup> Over 170 million people were slaughtered  by governments during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Ten million died  in World War I and fifty million died in World War II. Of those who  were killed during World War II, almost 70% were civilians. This so-called  collateral damage was a consequence of indiscriminant bombing by Britain  and America. <sup>87</sup> Then there was Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War,  the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a potential war in Iran and the unpublicized  CIA wars. Yet, many citizens, rather than focusing on America’s brutality,  claim that Islam is violent.</p>
<p>The Muslims are not the enemy.  They don’t extort usury through the Federal Reserve; they aren’t  manufacturing population-reducing vaccines and GMO seeds; they didn’t  devise our abortion laws (about fifty million dead); they didn’t bail  out the banks; they didn’t create the Department of Homeland Security  and impose the PATRIOT Act; they aren’t wiretapping our private conversations  or scanning us at the airport; they didn’t impose godless Communism  on several countries and cause the death of millions of innocent people;  they haven’t instituted the draconian healthcare laws; they have not  orchestrated the nation’s economic crashes; they have not deindustrialized  the nation and outsourced so many jobs; they haven’t wiped out the  middle class by passing trade laws like NAFTA; <sup>88</sup> and they  haven’t foreclosed on thousands of homes; they are not the reason  thousands of people live in tent cities; they haven’t developed depleted  uranium weapons. Instead of worrying about a mosque, consider what’s  going on behind the closed doors at the Federal Reserve, the Pentagon,  the Senate and House chambers, the CFR, the State Department, the UN  or dozens of other places. The Muslims didn’t instigate the attacks  on the <em>USS Liberty</em> or the <em>USS Cole </em> and they didn’t orchestrate the highly organized attack in Manhattan  on 9/11.</p>
<p>People should  be burning the 9/11 Commission  Report or if they insist on burning a religious book, burn the Bible  or the Talmud instead of the <a href="http://www.brasschecktv.com/page/932.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quran</span></a>. Most of the people who insist that  the Quran is full of hate have never even seen the book.</p>

			<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/trutv-jesse-ventura2.jpg" alt="Jesse Ventura" />Former Navy SEAL, professional wrestler, and Minnesota governor, Jesse Ventura, recently launched a new television show on the truTV (formerly known as Court TV) cable channel. The first episode debuted on Wednesday, December 2, 2009. And the final episode of this season aired this past Wednesday, January 13, 2010.</p>
<p>Here is the official web site for truTV&#8217;s Conspiracy Theory:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trutv.com/shows/conspiracy_theory/index.html">http://www.trutv.com/shows/conspiracy_theory/index.html</a></p>
<p>According to press reports, 1.6 million viewers watched the premiere episode on December 2, which set a record for the network. I was one of those viewers. And I&#8217;ve seen each of this first season&#8217;s 7 episodes.</p>
<p>Predictably, mainstream critics have universally condemned the series. Linda Stasi of The Washington Times said the show is &#8220;Mindless, good fun and a hoot to watch aging action stars still taking action.&#8221; Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times said, &#8220;Whatever truth is out there, it&#8217;s filtered here through what is arranged more as an adventure series than a documentary.&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all, let me state up front that I typically disdain &#8220;reality&#8221; shows. The only ones that are any good are Les Stroud&#8217;s Survivorman and Bear Grylls&#8217; Man vs. Wild (and I really enjoy both of those programs). The rest of the so-called &#8220;reality&#8221; shows are junk, as far as I&#8217;m concerned (okay, I did enjoy watching a few episodes of Ice Road Truckers).</p>
<p>Contrary to the rants of modern critics, however, Ventura&#8217;s Conspiracy Theory is not &#8220;reality&#8221; television or &#8220;mindless, good fun.&#8221; It is better investigative reporting than anything I&#8217;ve seen on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN or FOX NEWS in a long, long time.</p>
<p>For the most part, the mainstream media have become lackeys and lap dogs for the established political order and the powerful potentates that control it. Yes, I&#8217;m saying it: we have a tightly controlled mainstream media in America today (especially at the national level). Reporters are told what to report (or more fittingly, what NOT to report) and how to report it; and any reporter or journalist who dares to step outside the box will quickly be unemployed. And for those of you journalists and reporters who are reading this right now, if you smirk at what I just said, why don&#8217;t you try it and see what happens? Anything that challenges the establishment&#8217;s order is totally off-limits. Every reporter and journalist working for the establishment media knows where the &#8220;third rail&#8221; is&#8211;and they avoid it at all costs. And the cost is TRUTH.</p>
<p>No wonder the critics hate Ventura&#8217;s show: here was the first season episode lineup (taken from its web site):</p>
<p>Week One: HAARP</p>
<p>Is it a communications research project or a doomsday weapon that can change the weather, shoot satellites out of orbit&#8211;and trigger mind control across the globe? Jesse Ventura and his team head north to a remote region of Alaska to confront the military installation called HAARP.</p>
<p>Week Two: 9/11</p>
<p>Jesse Ventura steps into America&#8217;s most controversial conspiracy by challenging the 9/11 Commission Report and searching for evidence that the September 11th attacks may have been an inside job. At the urging of victims&#8217; families, he finds witnesses who claim the towers were brought down by explosives, the missing black box flight recorders were actually recovered and ground control knew the hijackers were in the cockpits before the jets took off.</p>
<p>Week Three: Global Warming</p>
<p>Whether global warming is real or not, it&#8217;s believed some people are using the issue to make billions of dollars, start a one-world government and control our lives, from the cars we drive to the foods we eat. Jesse Ventura starts with Al Gore and goes far beyond as he uncovers the evidence that leads to one man thought to be behind the global warming conspiracy.</p>
<p>Week Four: Big Brother</p>
<p>Big Brother is watching and it&#8217;s not who you think. Jesse Ventura&#8217;s investigation of government surveillance on its citizens tears the lid off a nationwide program that is thought to turn local businessmen and office workers into spies, snooping on their neighbors and ratting on their friends in exchange for information and special privileges from the FBI&#8211;including, some charge, a &#8220;license to kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Week Five: Secret Societies</p>
<p>They&#8217;re thought to be a group of the world&#8217;s elite who meet once a year at a luxury hotel and decide how they will run the world. It&#8217;s believed they plan to thin out the population through disease&#8211;and vaccines. Jesse Ventura infiltrates the Bilderberg Group.</p>
<p>Week Six: Manchurian Candidate</p>
<p>Authors and experts warn that forces within the government have revived a program that uses mind control techniques to turn ordinary citizens into programmed assassins. This real-life Manchurian Candidate seems outlandish&#8211;until Jesse Ventura searches for the evidence and goes face-to-face with a man who claims he&#8217;s one of the killers.</p>
<p>Week Seven: Apocalypse 2012</p>
<p>It&#8217;s believed that the world is heading for disaster in 2012 and the government is preparing to save and protect the elite&#8211;while leaving the rest of us to fend for ourselves. Jesse Ventura investigates claims of top secret underground bunkers being built in places ranging from the Nevada desert to the White House, including the largest, now under construction beneath a major metropolitan airport.</p>
<p>As one can easily see, each of these topics is a &#8220;third rail&#8221; to the vast majority of the mainstream media&#8211;especially at the national level. Yet, Ventura (and truTV) had the guts to tackle these topics head-on. And he broached each investigation with a deliberate professionalism and dogged determination befitting a Navy SEAL.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, anyone who believes that there is no concerted effort&#8211;no conspiracy, if you please&#8211;by wealthy and powerful individuals to steal our liberties and turn us into slaves and serfs is totally not paying attention, or is in a psychotic dream world of denial, or is a compliant partner with the conspiracy.</p>
<p>How Christians, especially, can doubt the existence of a devilish conspiracy to trample not only our freedom, but also our faith, is doubly disconcerting. Does not Scripture plainly warn, &#8220;Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.&#8221; (Psalms 2:1-3 KJV)</p>
<p>Christians, of all people, should be the first ones to join in fighting against the promoters and purveyors of this devilish New World Order that is wreaking havoc upon our country. That so many of them are not is a stain against the Church&#8211;of gargantuan proportions!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/body-scanner2.jpg" alt="body scanner" />Did Ventura get every jot and tittle perfect? Probably not. Given the depth of the corruption and cover up that has gone into the promotion and implementation of the matters discussed&#8211;not to mention the limited time and resources available to Ventura and his small staff&#8211;that he was able to dig up the amount of testimony and material that he did was absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>I anxiously await the arrival of the entire first season on DVD. I suggest you obtain a copy as soon as they are available, as well, because this program will probably face the same fate as the CBS program JERICHO: swift cancellation. The powers that be are adamantly opposed to the light of truth shining on their dark desires and draconian designs. If you doubt that, get this:</p>
<p>&#8220;In a lengthy academic paper, President Obama&#8217;s regulatory czar, Cass Sunstein, argued the U.S. government should ban &#8216;conspiracy theorizing.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the beliefs Sunstein would ban is advocating that the theory of global warming is a deliberate fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunstein also recommended the government send agents to infiltrate [I'm sure they already do] &#8216;extremists who supply conspiracy theories&#8217; to disrupt the efforts of the &#8216;extremists&#8217; to propagate their theories.&#8221;</p>
<p>See the whole report at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&#038;pageId=121884">http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&#038;pageId=121884</a></p>
<p>In the coming Brave New World currently being manufactured by today&#8217;s globalists, even believing &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221; might soon be illegal. Do you really think they will let patriots such as Jesse Ventura continue to awaken people to what&#8217;s going on? So, you&#8217;d better get the DVDs while you can (and if you can).</p>
<p>In the meantime, Thank you, Governor. It was a job well done!</p>
