Sidewalks brim with tables and merry customers, even traffic jams are less severe due to holiday season. The only danger for men is the girls’ dresses, they are precariously short.</p>
<p>In a few days, perhaps even tomorrow, the charms and  dangers of the city will be available to Edward Snowden, who is about to receive a refugee ID,  allowing him to roam freely the whole length and breadth of Russia and to socialise with its folk.</p>
<p>It will be a nice change from Sheremetyevo International Airport, where he was marooned for quite a while. The airport is vast; some unfortunates, mainly paperless refugees, live in its transit area for ten years or more. For a while, it was felt that our hero would remain stuck forever in limbo. The Russians and the intrepid Snowden sat on the fence, getting used to each other while keeping their distance. At long last, the ice was broken.  Snowden had gotten to meet with  representatives of the Russian public: a few members of Parliament (called Duma, in Russian), some human rights folks, leading lawyers.</p>
<p>He reminded them that he “had the capability without any warrant to search for, seize, and read your communications… [and] change people’s fates”. He invoked the US Constitution transgressed by the spooks, for the Constitution “forbids such systems of massive, pervasive surveillance”. He rightly rejected the legal ruse of Obama’s secret courts, for no secrecy can purify the impure. He recalled the Nuremberg ruling: &#8220;Individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring.&#8221; And this system of total surveillance is indeed  a crime against humanity, the cornerstone of the Iron Heel regime they plan to establish on the planet. When his declaration was interrupted by the airport&#8217;s routine announcements over the loudspeaker, he charmingly smiled and said “I’ve heard it so many times during the last week”.</p>
<p>The Russians loved him; the whole attitude to Snowden changed for better, as I expected when <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/26100/2997749/">I called</a> for this meeting on the pages of the leading Russian newspaper, the KP (Komsomolskaya Pravda). Now we&#8217;ve learned that the Russians have decided to issue him a refugee ID and grant him freedom of movement.</p>
<p><strong>Why did they hesitate for so long?</strong></p>
<p>Snowden is an American, and the Americans, like the British, are quite prejudiced against Russia, their common Cold War enemy. For them, it is the country of the Gulag and the KGB. Though both menaces vanished decades ago, traditions die hard, if at all. Even the Gulag and the KGB were only a modernised version of the Tsar, knout and serfdom horror of the 19th century, to be eventually superseded by the Brutal New Russian Mafia State as updated by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/mafia-state-luke-harding">Luke Harding</a>. For an average American, the prospect of befriending Russia is nigh unto impossible. Even more so for an American who served in the CIA and NSA, as Snowden did. He felt that by embracing Russia he would lose his whistle-blower status and be regarded as an enemy agent, a totally different kettle of fish.</p>
<p>This was the case for Julian Assange, as well.  When it was proposed that the head of Wikileaks flee to Russia (it was technically possible), he procrastinated, dragged his feet and remained in England,  unable, in the end, to cross the great East/West divide.</p>
<p>Snowden was not seeking limelight, quite the opposite!  He wished to stop the crimes being committed by No Such Agency in the name of American people, no more, no less.  He hoped to become a new Deep Throat, whose identity would never be revealed.  His first profound revelations were made by correspondence; he flew to Hong Kong as he was familiar with the place, spoke fluent Chinese, and planned to return home to Hawaii. It appears  that the Guardian Newspaper pushed him into revealing his identity. Even then he thought himself safe, for Hong Kong is under Chinese sovereignty, and China is a mighty state, not an easy pushover.</p>
<p>The Chinese used Snowden’s revelations to defuse American accusations of electronic espionage, but they weren’t going to spoil relations with the US for his sake – the hot potato was tossed.  As a final courtesy they gave him 24 hours warning of his impending arrest. He had to flee, and he boarded the Aeroflot flight to Moscow in company of charming English lady, a Wikileaks executive Sarah Harrison.</p>
<p>Snowden landed in Moscow, but he never considered taking refuge in Russia. For him, this was just a transit point to a neutral country, be it Iceland or Venezuela, some part of the West. He planned to fly to Havana and change planes there for Caracas. He did not take into account the length to which the US Deep State would go to seize and punish him.</p>
<p>At first, the Americans put enormous pressure on Cuba to refuse transit for Snowden. They threatened Cuba with invasion and blockade, and Castro asked Snowden to look for another route. No airline but Aeroflot would fly Snowden out of Russia, and Aeroflot flies via Havana only. So the first plan got unstuck.</p>
<p>The gas summit in Moscow offered another opportunity for escape: the summit was attended by the presidents of Bolivia and Venezuela, both came with their private planes able to make the long flight. Bolivian president Evo Morales had left Moscow first; his plane was forced down and searched, setting a historical precedent. This served as a warning to the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro; he flew away from Moscow Snowden-less.</p>
<p>This was an important discovery for Ed Snowden: he learned by this experience that there is just one country on the planet that is outside of the US grasp. Just one country that is a real alternative to the Empire; the only country Navy Seals are not likely to raid nor Obama drones to bomb, the only country whose planes can’t be scrambled and searched. He understood that Moscow is the only safe place on the globe for an identified enemy of the Empire. Now he was ready to contact the Russians;  he resumed his temporary refuge request, which will probably be granted.</p>
<p>The Russians also hesitated. They were not keen on angering the US, they were aware that Snowden did not intend to come to them and just happened to get stuck in transit. He was a hot potato, and many people were convinced it&#8217;s better to follow the Chinese example and toss him.</p>
<p>The US Lobby pulled out all the stops trying to have him extradited. There were human rights activists and NGO members in the employ of the US State Department. Such people and organisations are promoted by the Americans, a Fifth Column of sorts. Lyudmila Alexeeva is a leading Russian activist of this kind; she was an anti-Soviet dissident, acquired US citizenship, came back to Russia and resumed her fight for human rights and against the Russian state. She is on record as saying that Snowden is a traitor to the service, neither a whistle-blower nor a human rights defender. He should be surrendered to the US, she averred. Other notorious dissidents and fighters against Putin&#8217;s regime agreed with her, unmasking their true colours.</p>
<p>Some <em>siloviki</em> were also against Snowden. These are members and ex-members of Russian intelligence community, who embraced the concept of convergence of security services and collaborated with the Americans and other services, notably the Israelis. They said that loyalty to one&#8217;s service is the most important virtue, and a traitor can&#8217;t be trusted. They pooh-poohed Snowden’s revelations saying they had known it all along. They said he is not worth quarrelling with Washington about. This  was also the line of Konstantin Remchukov, an important Russian media lord, the owner of <em>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</em>, who added that Snowden was a Chinese spy.</p>
<p>And finally there were conspiracy freaks, who said that Snowden is a Trojan Horse, sent to pry open Russian secrets. He was actually a CIA double agent, they said. No, he was an agent of Mossad, others argued. Return him to the US, they asserted. This bottom line has exposed many American agents, whether faux human rights defenders or equally false <em>siloviki</em>, security personnel.</p>
<p>Among supporters of Snowden in Russia, there was my friend, the poet Eduard Limonov, who called Snowden the harbinger of Unipolar World collapse. My newspaper <a href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/user/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/AppData/Local/Temp/KP.ru">KP</a> supported the cause as well. The state-owned TV took a cautious approach, and was rather dismissive of Snowden’s discoveries.</p>
<p>President Putin, too, played a cautious game. Initially, he stopped talk of surrendering Snowden with a laconic statement: «Russia never ever extradites anybody to any state». Then he offered Snowden refuge on condition that he would not act against the US. This is a usual condition for a political refuge. He added that probably Snowden would not accept it as he wants to continue his struggle “just like Professor Sakharov”, a renown dissident of Soviet days. He also tried to dissuade America from pursuing Snowden, comparing this pursuit with “shearing a piglet”, producing more screams than wool. This cautious game paid well: Snowden accepted his precondition and applied for temporary refuge until the road to Latin America opens up for him, while the President saved face and did his best to avoid quarrelling with the US and with the mighty pro-American lobby in Moscow. I should say that despite his autocratic macho image, Putin does not control free Russian media, which are usually owned by pro-Western media lords. His positions in the national discourse get limited exposure.</p>
<p>The Russian leader was not confrontational. He does not look for trouble, as a rule. He comes off as rather a cautious, prudent, conservative ruler. He would probably prefer that Snowden fly away, especially as Snowden, an American patriot, would not share his stolen crown jewels with the Russians. His granting permission for Snowden to meet with the Russian public was withheld for a long while. However, during this period, the US added many more names to the secret Magnitsky List of Russians whose properties and accounts were to be snatched (“frozen” is the technical term) by the US and its allies. Members of Congress freely vituperated against Putin and referred to Russia in abusive terms. Just wait &#8212; Obama will call Putin tonight and he will send Snowden packing, said the White House spokesman. Meanwhile, the US continued its build-up against Syria in the Middle East, and Israel bombed Syrian positions, presumably with American support. Instead of showing any consideration, Obama tried to bully Putin. This was the wrong tactic, and it backfired.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia carried out a sudden check of its military preparedness, apparently keeping all options open. This great country is not looking for trouble, but it does not shrink from it either. Snowden is safe here in Moscow, where nobody can harm him, so he will be able to tell the world about the crimes against humanity committed by the American secret services. And Moscow is a great place to be, especially in summer.</p>

<p>Most Canadians had never heard of the Communications Security Establishment (CSEC), the Canadian counterpart of the US National Security Agency (NSA), prior to last month’s <em>Globe and Mail</em> report that CSEC has been metadata mining Canadians’ electronic communications since 2005.</p>
<p>And Canada’s elite is determined to keep it that way—to ensure that the public knows as little as possible about the activities of CSEC.</p>
<p>The Conservative government and CSEC have responded with a series of lies, half-truths and disingenuous statements to the revelation that Canada’s signal intelligence agency has been collecting Canadians’ metadata. Peter MacKay, who until last week’s cabinet shuffle was the minister in charge of CSEC, lied repeatedly and brazenly in the days following the exposure of CSEC’s metadata mining, declaring that CSEC is only involved with “foreign threats.” A former CSEC deputy director, meanwhile, termed the exposure a “manufactured” story. Yet, the Supreme Court Justice who served as the government-appointed “watchdog” on CSEC’s activities from August 2006 until his death in July 2009 repeatedly raised concerns that the program violated the agency’s mandate and Canadians’ rights.</p>
<p>The government’s aim is to cover up the fact that the CSEC is systematically spying on Canadians and collecting information that can be—and undoubtedly is being—used by Canada’s national security apparatus to identify and develop intimate portraits of the views, habits and connections of individuals and groups that it deems hostile to the interests of Canadian big business and its state.</p>
<p>The press and opposition parties, for their part, quickly dropped discussion of CSEC’s activities.</p>
<p>The reality is that CSEC functions as part of a burgeoning state-within-the-state: a network of national intelligence, military and police agencies that are armed with draconian powers, subject to little and ever-shrinking judicial and parliamentary oversight, and shielded from public scrutiny.</p>
<p>CSEC is, as far as we know, the most secretive part of this network. It functions under secret ministerial directives issued by the Defence Minister. Not only are the directives’ contents shrouded in secrecy, even their topics are kept secret from the public, opposition and government parliamentarians, and almost all ministers.</p>
<p>CSEC does not report directly to parliament and its activities are not subject to the oversight of a parliamentary committee. Until 2011 it released annual reports through the Ministry of Defence that were tailored to obfuscate its activities. Since then, it is no longer obliged to publicly issue any annual report or document outlining its plans, priorities and performance.</p>
<p>Hugh Segal—the Conservative Senator who heads the Senate’s Special Committee on Anti-Terrorism—admitted that he first learned that CSEC is metadata mining Canadians’ electronic communication through the <em>Globe and Mail</em> ’s June 10 report.</p>
<p>The government has sought to calm public concern about CSEC by claiming that it is legally barred from spying on Canadians and that there is a “legal wall” between its activities and those of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).</p>
<p>This is quite simply an untruth.</p>
<p>One of CSEC’s main functions is to assist CSIS and RCMP in upholding national security.</p>
<p>Also, it can investigate Canadians’ communications if it deems that they are relevant to any investigation it is carrying out of “foreign threats.”</p>
<p>Third, we now know that since 2005, and under Liberal and Conservative governments alike, CSEC has been mining the metadata of Canadians’ electronic communications. The government has refused to provide any details of this program, but the US NSA—with which it has closely collaborated for more than six decades—is known to systematically collect and analyze the metadata of all Internet, telephone and cellphone communications.</p>
<p>In 2007, CSEC’s then head, John Adams, declared that his agency’s ambition was to “master the Internet.” “Our vision,” Adams told the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence, “is security through information superiority. We want to master the Internet. That is a challenge that no one institution—be it ours or the National Security Agency, NSA, for that matter—can manage on their own. We try to do that in conjunction with our allies.”</p>
<p>To square their claim that CSEC is not spying on Canadians with CSEC’s mining of the metadata of Canadians’ electronic communications, CSEC and the government have advanced the spurious claim that metadata is “not communication” and therefore can be accessed without having to seek approval from the courts.</p>
<p>Significantly, the ministerial directive MacKay issued in 2011 authorizing the continuation of CSEC’s metadata mining program invokes this subterfuge. According to the <em>Globe and Mail</em>, which has seen a heavily redacted version of the directive, it declares, “Metadata is information associated with a telecommunication…and not a communication.”</p>
<p>Fourth and finally, although CSEC is legally barred from requesting its partners to spy on Canadians, nothing prohibits it and other Canadian intelligence agencies from accepting intelligence offered it by the NSA and other allied agencies. In a revealing interview with the <em>Toronto Star</em>, Wayne Easter—the minister responsible for CSIS in 2002-3—said that it was <em>de rigueur</em> for the NSA to pass on intelligence about Canadians and for CSIS to accept it. Further confirmation of this practice comes from Britain. David Blunkett, British Home Secretary from 2001-4, told that country’s parliament last month that the NSA routinely “offers intelligence” to Britain’s signal intelligence agency, GCHQ, so as to enable it to circumvent the restrictions on its spying on Britons without ministerial authorization.</p>
<p>The government and CSEC have denied that anything comparable to the NSA’s PRISM program, under which the US agency has had unfettered access to the servers of major computer and Internet corporations like Apple, Google and Facebook, exists in Canada. But both the NSA and the corporations involved denied they were collaborators in any such scheme until they were unmasked thanks to the efforts of whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>According to Tamir Israel, a staff lawyer with the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, were Internet and phone providers being ordered by the Canadian government to provide information, the order would invariably include nondisclosure conditions.</p>
<p>The big corporations that control the country’s telecommunications have, it should be added, a clear record of collaborating with the state. 95 percent of all requests by local police, the RCMP and CSIS for subscriber information are offered voluntarily without recourse to a warrant.</p>
<p>The little we do know of CSEC’s activities indicates that its operations are closely integrated with those of the NSA and that the NSA views it as one its most trusted partners. CSEC, for instance, assisted the United States and Britain in spying on participants at the London G20 summit in 2009—a highly sensitive operation.</p>
<p>Documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published by <em>The Guardian</em>detail how CSEC, the NSA and GCHQ monitored the phone calls and computer usage of foreign politicians and officials, including those of NATO allies such as France and Germany.</p>
<p>CSEC is also deeply involved in the Canadian elite’s predatory wars. In 2010, the then CSEC chief, retired CAF General John Adams, boasted, “If you were to ask the Canadian Forces if there is anyone that has saved Canadian lives in Afghanistan, they would point to us.” He claimed that over half of the “actionable intelligence” that Canadian soldiers use in prosecuting the Afghan War came from CSEC.</p>
<p>As around the world, the Canadian elite has used the bogus “war on terror” to justify an assault on democratic rights and to develop the veritable infrastructure for a police state. CSEC has been front and center in these developments. First Liberal and now Conservative governments have lavished resources on it. CSEC’s staff has doubled in the past decade and now numbers more than 2,000, while its annual budget has mushroomed to about $400 million.</p>
<p>Currently under construction is a new nearly $1 billion headquarters. The enormous new CSEC complex will be located next to CSIS’s headquarters. That a bridge is being built between the two headquarters further underlines the close working relationship between the two spying agencies and puts the lie to the government’s claim that “legal” walls separate their operations and confine them to distinct domains.</p>

			<p><strong>NYT: &#8220;The Obama administration made common cause with the House Republican leadership&#8221;</strong></p>
<div><img itemprop="contentUrl representativeOfPage" alt="Michele Bachmann" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/4/1325698548239/bachmann_quitting.jpg" width="460" height="276" /><em><br />
One of the most vocal supporters of the Obama White House&#8217;s position on yesterday&#8217;s NSA debate: GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. </em></p>
</div>
<div id="article-body-blocks">
<p>One of the worst myths Democratic partisans love to tell themselves &#8211; and everyone else &#8211; is that the GOP refuses to support President Obama no matter what he does. Like its close cousin &#8211; the massively deceitful inside-DC grievance that the two parties refuse to cooperate on anything &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to overstate how false this Democratic myth is. When it comes to foreign policy, war, assassinations, drones, surveillance, secrecy, and civil liberties, President Obama&#8217;s most stalwart, enthusiastic defenders are often found among the most radical precincts of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The rabidly pro-war and anti-Muslim GOP former Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Peter King, has <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/06/10/obama_defender_rep_peter_king/">repeatedly lavished Obama with all sorts of praise</a> and support for his policies in those areas. The Obama White House frequently <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/07/democrats-obama-afghanistan-war-/1">needs, and receives</a>, large amounts of GOP Congressional support to have <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll036.xml">its measures enacted</a> or bills its dislikes defeated. The Obama DOJ <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/04/03/the_obama_doj_and_strip_searches/">often prevails before the US Supreme Court</a> solely because the Roberts/Scalia/Thomas faction adopts its view while the Ginsburg/Sotomayor/Breyer faction rejects it (as happened in February when the Court, by a 5-4 ruling, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-1025">dismissed a lawsuit</a> brought by Amnesty and the ACLU which argued that the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on NSA" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nsa">NSA</a>&#8216;s domestic warrantless eavesdropping activities violate the Fourth Amendment; the Roberts/Scalia wing accepted the Obama DOJ&#8217;s argument that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue because the NSA successfully conceals the identity of which Americans are subjected to the surveillance). As Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/02/scotus-surveillance-challenge/">put it at the time about that NSA ruling</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 5-4 decision by Justice Samuel Alito was a clear victory for the President Barack Obama administration, which like its predecessor, argued that government wiretapping laws cannot be challenged in court.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary events that took place in the House of Representatives yesterday are perhaps the most vivid illustration yet of this dynamic, and it independently reveals several other important trends. The House voted on an <a href="http://amash.house.gov/speech/amash-nsa-amendment-fact-sheet">amendment sponsored by Justin Amash</a>, the young Michigan lawyer elected in 2010 as a Tea Party candidate, and co-sponsored by John Conyers, the 24-term senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. The amendment was simple. It would de-fund one single NSA program: the agency&#8217;s bulk collection of the telephone records of all Americans that we <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">first revealed in this space, back on June 6</a>. It accomplished this &#8220;by requiring the FISA court under Sec. 215 [of the Patriot Act] to order the production of records that pertain <em>only to a person under investigation</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>The amendment yesterday was defeated. But it <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml">lost by only 12 votes: 205-217</a>. Given that the amendment sought to de-fund a major domestic surveillance program of the NSA, the very close vote was nothing short of shocking. In fact, in the post-9/11 world, amendments like this, which directly challenge the Surveillance and National Security States, almost never get votes at all. That the GOP House Leadership was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/justin-amash-nsa-surveillance_n_3637462.html?utm_hp_ref=politics">forced to allow it to reach the floor</a> was a sign of how much things have changed over the last seven weeks.</p>
<p>More significant than the closeness of the vote was its breakdown. A majority of House Democrats supported the Amash/Conyers amendment, while a majority of Republicans voted against it:</p>
<div><img alt="roll call" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/25/1374738406126/rollcall.png" width="460" height="151" /></p>
</div>
<p>The full roll call vote is <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml">here</a>. House Speaker John Boehner saved the Obama White House by voting against it and ensuring that his top leadership whipped against it. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/politics/house-defeats-effort-to-rein-in-nsa-data-gathering.html?hp">the New York Times put it</a> in its account of yesterday&#8217;s vote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Conservative Republicans leery of what they see as Obama administration abuses of power teamed up with liberal Democrats long opposed to intrusive intelligence programs. <em>The Obama administration made common cause with the House Republican leadership to try to block it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In reality, the fate of the amendment was sealed when the Obama White House on Monday night <a href="http://pastebin.com/RF5U59N0">announced its vehement opposition to it</a>, and then sent NSA officials to the House to scare members that barring the NSA from collecting all phone records of all Americans would Help The Terrorists™.</p>
<p>Using Orwellian language so extreme as to be darkly hilarious, this was the first line of the White House&#8217;s statement opposing the amendment: &#8220;In light of the recent unauthorized disclosures, the President has said that he welcomes a debate about how best to simultaneously safeguard both our national security and the privacy of our citizens&#8221; (i.e.: we welcome the debate that has been exclusively enabled by that vile traitor, the same debate we&#8217;ve spent years trying to prevent with rampant abuse of our secrecy powers that has kept even the most basic facts about our spying activities concealed from the American people).</p>
<p>The White House then condemned Amash/Conyers this way: &#8220;This blunt approach is not the product of an informed, open, or deliberative process.&#8221; What a multi-level masterpiece of Orwellian political deceit that sentence is. The highly surgical Amash/Conyers amendment &#8211; which would eliminate a single, specific NSA program of indiscriminate domestic spying &#8211; is a &#8220;blunt approach&#8221;, but the Obama NSA&#8217;s bulk, indiscriminate collection of all Americans&#8217; telephone records is not a &#8220;blunt approach&#8221;. Even worse: Amash/Conyers &#8211; a House bill debated in public and then voted on in public &#8211; is not an &#8220;open or deliberative process&#8221;, as opposed to the Obama administration&#8217;s secret spying activities and the secret court that blesses its secret interpretations of law, which is &#8220;open and deliberative&#8221;. That anyone can write a statement like the one that came from the Obama White House without dying of shame, or giggles, is impressive.</p>
<p>Even more notable than the Obama White House&#8217;s defense of the NSA&#8217;s bulk domestic spying was the behavior of the House Democratic leadership. Not only did they all vote against de-funding the NSA bulk domestic spying program &#8211; that includes liberal icon House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who voted to protect the NSA&#8217;s program &#8211; but Pelosi&#8217;s deputy, Steny Hoyer, whipped against the bill by channeling the warped language and mentality of Dick Cheney. This is <a href="http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/democratic-whip-description-of.html">the language the Democratic leadership circulated</a> when telling their members to reject Amash/Conyers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;2) Amash/Conyers/Mulvaney/Polis/Massie Amendment – Bars the NSA and other agencies from using Section 215 of the Patriot Act (as codified by Section 501 of FISA) to collect records, including telephone call records, that pertain to persons who <em>may be in communication with terrorist groups</em>but are not already subject to an investigation under Section 215.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember when Democrats used to object so earnestly when Dick Cheney would scream &#8220;The Terrorists!&#8221; every time someone tried to rein in the National Security State just a bit and so modestly protect basic civil liberties? How well they have learned: now, a bill to ban the government from collecting the telephone records of <em>all Americans</em>, while expressly allowing it to collect the records of anyone for whom there is evidence of wrongdoing, is &#8211; in the language of the House Democratic Leadership &#8211; a bill to Protect The Terrorists.</p>
<p>None of this should be surprising. Remember: this is the same Nancy Pelosi who spent years during the Bush administration pretending to be a vehement opponent of the illegal Bush NSA warrantless eavesdropping program after it was revealed by the New York Times, even though (just as <a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/09/democrats_9/">was true of the Bush torture program</a>) she was secretly briefed on it many years earlier when it was first implemented. At the end of June, we published <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection">the top secret draft report by the Inspector General&#8217;s office of the NSA</a> that was required to provide a comprehensive history of the NSA warrantless eavesdropping program secretly ordered by Bush in late 2001. That report included this passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Within the first 30 days of the Program, over 190 people were cleared into the Program. This number included Senators Robert Graham and Richard Shelby, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, President George W. Bush, Vice President Richard Cheney, Counsel to the Vice President David Addington, and Presidential Assistant I. Lewis &#8216;Scooter&#8217; Libby.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So the history of Democratic leaders such as Nancy Pelosi isn&#8217;t one of opposition to mass NSA spying when Bush was in office, only to change positions now that Obama is. The history is of pretend opposition &#8211; of deceiving their supporters by feigning opposition &#8211; while actually supporting it.</p>
<p>But the most notable aspect of yesterday&#8217;s events was the debate on the House floor. The most vocal defenders of the Obama White House&#8217;s position were Rep. Mike Rogers, the very hawkish GOP Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachmann. Echoing the Democratic House leadership, Bachmann repeatedly warned that NSA bulk spying was necessary to stop &#8220;Islamic jihadists&#8221;, and she attacked Republicans who supported de-funding for rendering the nation vulnerable to The Terrorists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amash led the debate against the NSA program and repeatedly assigned time to many of the House&#8217;s most iconic liberals to condemn in the harshest terms the NSA program defended by the Obama White House. Conyers repeatedly stood to denounce the NSA program as illegal, unconstitutional and extremist. Manhattan&#8217;s Jerry Nadler said that &#8220;no administration should be permitted to operate beyond the law, as they&#8217;ve been doing&#8221;. Newly elected Democrat Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, an Iraq War combat veteran considered a rising star in her party, said that she could not in good conscience take a single dollar from taxpayers to fund programs that infringe on exactly those constitutional rights our troops (such as herself) have risked their lives for; she told me after the vote, by Twitter direct message, that the &#8220;battle [was] lost today but war not over. We will continue to press on this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>In between these denunciations of the Obama NSA from House liberals, some of the most conservative members of the House stood to read from the Fourth Amendment. Perhaps the most amazing moment came when GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner - <em>the prime author of the Patriot Act back in 2001</em> and a long-time defender of War on Terror policies under both Bush and Obama &#8211; stood up to say that the NSA&#8217;s domestic bulk spying far exceeds the bounds of the law he wrote as well as his belief in the proper limits of domestic surveillance, and announced his support for Amash/Conyers. Sensenbrenner was then joined in voting to de-fund the NSA program by House liberals such as Barbara Lee, Rush Holt, James Clyburn, Nydia Velázquez, Alan Grayson, and Keith Ellison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Senate, Democrat Ron Wyden continues to invoke unusually harsh language to condemn what the NSA is doing under Obama. Here is some of what he said in a speech this week at the Center for American Progress, as <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/312929-wyden-warns-data-collection-under-patriot-act-is-limitless#ixzz2a2mI2mxB">reported by the Hill</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Tuesday urged the United States to revamp its surveillance laws and practices, warning that the country will &#8216;live to regret it&#8217; if it fails to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;If we do not seize this unique moment in our constitutional history to reform our surveillance laws and practices, we will all live to regret it . . . The combination of increasingly advanced technology with a breakdown in the checks and balances that limit government action could lead us to a surveillance state that cannot be reversed,&#8217; he added. . . .</p>
<p>&#8220;The government has essentially kept people in the dark about their broad interpretations of the law, he said. Wyden tells constituents there are two Patriot Acts: One they read online at home and &#8216;the secret interpretation of the law that the government is actually relying upon.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;If Americans are not able to learn how their government is interpreting and executing the law then we have effectively eliminated the most important bulwark of our democracy,&#8221; he said. . . .</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This means that the government&#8217;s authority to collect information on law-abiding American citizens is essentially limitless&#8217;, he said.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wyden&#8217;s full speech &#8211; in which he makes clear that it is solely the disclosures of the last seven weeks that have enabled this debate and brought about a massive shift in public opinion &#8211; is remarkable and can be read <a href="http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/blog/post/wyden-on-nsa-domestic-surveillance">here</a>. That&#8217;s a senior Democrat and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee sounding exactly like Edward Snowden &#8211; and the ACLU &#8211; in denouncing the abuses of the American Surveillance State. Meanwhile, as soon as the House vote was over, Rep. Rush Holt, a long-time Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee,<a href="http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2013/07/rush-holt-repeal-surveillance-state-act.html">introduced</a> &#8220;The Surveillance State Repeal Act&#8221; that would repeal the legislative foundation for this massive spying, including the once-and-now-again-controversial Patriot Act, which the Obama administration in 2011 successfully had renewed without a single reform (after Democrat Harry Reid <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/harry-reid-rand-paul-spar-over-patriot-act-on-senate-floor/2011/05/25/AGcgWRBH_blog.html">accused opponents of its reform-free renewal</a> of endangering the Nation to The Terrorists).</p>
<p>To say that there is a major sea change underway &#8211; not just in terms of surveillance policy but broader issues of secrecy, trust in national security institutions, and civil liberties &#8211; is to state the obvious. But perhaps the most significant and enduring change will be the erosion of the trite, tired prism of partisan simplicity through which American politics has been understood over the last decade. What one sees in this debate is not Democrat v. Republican or left v. right. One sees authoritarianism v. individualism, fealty to The National Security State v. a belief in the need to constrain and check it, insider Washington loyalty v. outsider independence.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the only defenders of the NSA at this point are the decaying establishment leadership of both political parties whose allegiance is to the sprawling permanent power faction in Washington and the private industry that owns and controls it. They&#8217;re aligned against long-time liberals, the new breed of small government conservatives, the ACLU and other civil liberties groups, many of their own members, and<a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/10/1222479/-Quinnipiac-Massive-Shift-as-Public-Now-Says-War-on-Terror-Has-Gone-Too-Far">increasingly the American people</a>, who have grown tired of, and immune to, the relentless fear-mongering.</p>
<p>The sooner the myth of &#8220;intractable partisan warfare&#8221; is dispelled, the better. The establishment leadership of the two parties collaborate on far more than they fight. That is a basic truth that needs to be understood. As John Boehner joined with Nancy Peolsi, as Eric Cantor whipped support for the Obama White House, as Michele Bachmann and Peter King stood with Steny Hoyer to attack NSA critics as Terrorist-Lovers, yesterday was a significant step toward accomplishing that.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/americagermanyspy3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/americagermanyspy2.jpg" align="left" /></a>A<a href="http://sjlendman.blogspot.com/2013/07/stasis-new-incarnation.html" target="_blank"> previous articl</a>e discussed Stasi. It was East Germany&#8217;s secret police. It was one of the most repressive state apparatuses in modern times.</p>
<p>Its infamous reputation speaks for itself. It&#8217;s reincarnated in new form. Given today&#8217;s state-of-the-art technology. It&#8217;s worse now than then. The previous article said the following:</p>
<p>On July 7,<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/whistleblower-snowden-claims-german-intelligence-in-bed-with-nsa-a-909904.html" target="_blank"> Der Spiegel</a> headlined &#8220;Snowden claims: NSA Ties Put German Intelligence in Tight Spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in bed together,&#8221; said Snowden. NSA partners with foreign intelligence in other countries. Its &#8220;Foreign Affairs Directorate (BND)&#8221; does so.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s done in ways to &#8220;insulate their political leaders from the backlash.&#8221; It&#8217;s precautionary in case people learn &#8220;how grievously they&#8217;re violating global privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>BND/NSA cooperation is far greater than previously known. At issue are serious violations of Germany&#8217;s privacy laws. According to Der Spiegel, NSA provides &#8220;analysis tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re for &#8220;BND&#8217;s signals monitoring of foreign data streams that travel through Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides other areas, BND focuses on &#8220;the Middle East route through which data packets from crisis regions travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Der Spiegel said &#8220;BND pulls data from five different nodes that are then analyzed at the foreign intelligence service&#8217;s headquarters in Pullach near Munich.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gerhard Schindler heads it. He &#8220;confirmed the partnership during a meeting with members of the German parliament&#8217;s control committee for intelligence issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowden told Der Spiegel that German outrage over NSA spying was pretense. Both countries work closely together. Relations are longstanding.</p>
<p>Current operations far exceed Stasi&#8217;s. They&#8217;re conducted with technological ease. Decades earlier spying was crude compared to today&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Modern methods operate in unprecedented ways. Virtually everyone can be monitored everywhere at all times. Nearly everything about targets is known.</p>
<p>Almost nothing&#8217;s too secret to escape scrutiny. There&#8217;s no way to hide. There&#8217;s no place to do it.</p>
<p>On July 20, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agencies-used-nsa-spying-program-a-912173.html" target="_blank">Der Spiegel</a> headlined &#8221; &#8216;Prolific Partner:&#8217; German Intelligence Used NSA Spying Program,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>Chancellor Merkel lied. It didn&#8217;t surprise. She does it repeatedly. She &#8220;and her ministers claim they first learned about the US government&#8217;s comprehensive spying programs from press reports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But SPIEGEL has learned that German intelligence services themselves use one of the NSA&#8217;s most valuable tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>BND and its Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) intelligence agency collaborated with NSA. Secret documents reveal it.</p>
<p>They show BfV &#8220;was equipped with a program called XKeyScore intended to &#8216;expand their ability to support NSA as we jointly prosecute CT (counterterrorism) targets.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The BND is tasked with instructing the domestic intelligence agency on how to use the program, the documents say.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a &#8220;productive espionage tool.&#8221; It&#8217;s able to &#8220;retroactively reveal any terms&#8221; targeted persons type into search engines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s able to receive &#8220;full takeâ¤|unfiltered dataâ¤|including&#8221; communications content. It can do so over a period of days.</p>
<p>Documents show up to &#8220;500 million (monthly) data connections from Germany accessed by the NSA.&#8221; XKeyScore collects much of it.</p>
<p>German/NSA cooperation &#8220;recently intensified.&#8221; BND&#8217;s Schindler expressed an &#8220;eagerness and desire&#8221; to do so. According to NSA:</p>
<p>&#8220;The BND has been working to influence the German government to relax interpretation of the privacy laws to provide greater opportunities of intelligence sharing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2012, Germany showed a &#8220;willingness to take risks and to pursue new opportunities for cooperation with the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, BND was NSA&#8217;s &#8220;most prolific partner.&#8221; The relationship is longstanding. It&#8217;s hard-wired. Merkel lied. Anger expressed over US spying was fake.</p>
<p>She knows what&#8217;s going on. She&#8217;s involved. On September 22, German federal elections are scheduled. Voters will choose Bundestag representatives.</p>
<p>Merkel&#8217;s coalition needs up to 300 or more seats to retain power. Until NSA spying and Germany&#8217;s involvement were revealed, easy reelection was expected.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s seeking a third term. Perhaps she won&#8217;t get it. Earlier polls showed her ahead. Voters may have second thoughts. They&#8217;ll  decide if she&#8217;s a spent force. In weeks we&#8217;ll know.</p>
<p>In the meantime, expect more revelations. On July 19, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/journalist-says-explosive-reports-coming-from-snowden-data-a-912034.html" target="_blank">Der Spiegel</a> headlined &#8220;Greenwald: &#8216;Explosive&#8217; NSA Spying Reports Are Imminent,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>Expect them in a few days. They&#8217;ll be the next shoe to drop. They&#8217;ll be &#8220;more explosive in Germany&#8221; than previous reports.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll tell more about BND/NSA cooperation. Greenwald said he&#8217;s got around 9,000 to 10,000 top secret documents. He&#8217;s had them for weeks.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been analyzing them. Some documents are &#8220;extremely complicated.&#8221; He&#8217;s living in Rio de Janeiro. CIA has a &#8220;robust&#8221; presence there.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s worried about his safety. He feels &#8220;threatened in the sense that there are very prominent American politicians and even American journalists who have called for (his) arrest, who have called (him) a criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Possession of top secret US documents jeopardizes his safety. He&#8217;s got multiple copies. He maintains regular contact with Snowden. They use &#8220;encrypted chat technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>German/NSA cooperation isn&#8217;t at the same level as Britain, Australia, Canada or New Zealand. It&#8217;s the &#8220;next tier where they exchange information all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s intensifying. BND&#8217;s Schindler&#8217;s eager to do so. Perhaps Germany&#8217;s heading for joint NSA cooperation matching any other country.</p>
<p>A Final Comment</p>
<p>On July 18, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/house-judiciary-committee-rails-against-domestic-spying" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> headlined &#8220;House Judiciary Committee Rails Against Domestic Spying,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>House Judiciary Committee members &#8220;grilled&#8221; government witnesses. It was more show than tell. Obama officials &#8220;hid behind secrecy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grilling belies congressional sincerity. Congress, the courts, Obama, and administration officials are co-conspirators. It shows in legislation enacted.</p>
<p>It shows in court decisions. It shows America&#8217;s current state. Washington&#8217;s criminal class is bipartisan. It includes High Court justices.</p>
<p>Police state lawlessness replaced constitutional law. Full-blown tyranny&#8217;s a hair&#8217;s breadth away. America&#8217;s no longer safe to live in. Universal monitoring persists.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s official policy. Corporate bosses are complicit. Democracy&#8217;s a convenient illusion. So is freedom. It&#8217;s on the chopping block for elimination. It&#8217;s practically gone already.</p>
<p>Doing the right thing is criminalized. Press freedom&#8217;s up for grabs. On July 19, The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/us/in-major-ruling-court-orders-times-reporter-to-testify.html?_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1374495880-G8L6D6+bbCmoSuMcX1uhOw" target="_blank">New York Times</a> headlined &#8220;Court Tells Reporter to Testify in Case of Leaked CIA Data,&#8221; saying:</p>
<p>The US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Times writer James Risen must do so. It said First Amendment protections don&#8217;t cover &#8220;unauthorized leaks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal District court Judge Leonie Brinkema held otherwise. She got it right. She supported press freedom. She called it First Amendment &#8220;reporter&#8217;s privilege.&#8221; Obama&#8217;s DOJ claims it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Appeals Court Chief Judge William Byrd Traxler wrote the majority (two/one) ruling, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly, Risen&#8217;s direct, firsthand account of the criminal conduct indicted by the grand jury cannot be obtained by alternative means, as Risen is without dispute the only witness who can offer this critical testimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no First Amendment testimonial privilege, absolute or qualified, that protects a reporter from being compelled to testify by the prosecution or the defense in criminal proceedings about criminal conduct that the reporter personally witnessed or participated in, absent a showing of bad faith, harassment, or other such non-legitimate motive, even though the reporter promised confidentiality to his source.&#8221;</p>
<p>Risen vowed to go to prison rather than testify. He may end up there. He&#8217;ll appeal to the Supreme Court. Odds of winning are slim.</p>
<p>The Court&#8217;s stacked with right wing extremists. They&#8217;re largely comfortable with police state lawlessness. It shows in their rulings.</p>
<p>Risen may first ask for a full Fourth Circuit ruling. His lawyer Joel Kurtzberg said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are disappointed by and disagree with the court&#8217;s decision. We are currently evaluating our next steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fourth Circuit&#8217;s Judge Roger Gregory &#8220;vigorous(ly) dissent(ed).&#8221; He called the ruling a threat to investigative journalism, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the majority’s articulation of the reporter’s privilege, or lack thereof, absent a showing of bad faith by the government, a reporter can always be compelled against her will to reveal her confidential sources in a criminal trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the limits of who may claim reporter’s privilege, it is clear that Risen &#8211; a full-time reporter for a national news publication, The New York Times &#8211; falls into the category of people who should be eligible to invoke the privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority exalts the interests of the government while unduly trampling those of the press, and in doing so, severely impinges on the press and the free flow of information in our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s ruling set a precedent. It applies only to the Fourth Circuit. It&#8217;s important. It includes Maryland and Virginia. It&#8217;s Pentagon, CIA and NSA headquarters.</p>
<p>Risen&#8217;s case pertains to information in his 2006 book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0743270673" target="_blank">State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s about Bush era CIA tactics. Clinton also.</p>
<p>It involves &#8220;trick(ing) Iranian scientists by having a Russian defector give them blueprints for a nuclear triggering device that had been altered with an error.&#8221;</p>
<p>It &#8220;portrays the operation as reckless and botched in a way that could have helped the Iranians gain accurate information.&#8221;</p>
<p>In December 2010, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was called Risen&#8217;s source. He was indicted on Espionage Act charges.</p>
<p>According to Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, since 1984, 17 journalists were jailed for refusing to testify or disclose sources.</p>
<p>Police states operate this way. America&#8217;s by far the worst. For sure it&#8217;s the most reckless, outlandish and dangerous.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/syrianconflict3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/syrianconflict2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Conflict drags on interminably. Dozens or more die daily. Syrian forces outmatch Western-backed death squad terrorists. They&#8217;re not rebels. They&#8217;re lawless invaders.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re US proxy fighters. They&#8217;re imported from dozens of countries. They&#8217;re waging war against sovereign Syrian independence. Don&#8217;t expect duplicitous Western politicians or media scoundrels to explain.</p>
<p>Assad&#8217;s military outguns and outflanks Washington&#8217;s shock troops. Reinforcements keep coming. Libya 2.0 looks possible. Perhaps likely.</p>
<p>Russia hopes for a September international peace conference. Originally a June one was planned. Why bother when Washington prioritizes war. It spurns peace. Last year&#8217;s conference failed.</p>
<p>Expect nothing different this time. Peace remains elusive. Advocates have no partners.</p>
<p>According to European Council president Herman Van Rompuy:</p>
<p>&#8220;A military solution to the crisis is impossible. (T)he solution is only diplomatic.&#8221; Conflict can end soon. It can happen if Washington calls off its dogs. It shouldn&#8217;t have unleashed them in the first place.</p>
<p>Syria is Obama&#8217;s war. He began it. He can end it. Not according to some reports. On July 18, London&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/18/obama-military-power-syria-martin-dempsey" target="_blank">Guardian headlined</a> &#8220;Obama considering military power in Syria, top general tells Senate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey said he provided Obama with &#8220;options for the use of force.&#8221; He declined to explain more.</p>
<p>&#8220;(I)t would be inappropriate for me to try to influence the decision with me rendering an opinion in public about what kind of force we should use.&#8221;</p>
<p>John McCain&#8217;s super-hawkish. He&#8217;s not alone. He asked the wrong question. He asked Dempsey what carries greater risk: continued limited Washington intervention or more robust tactics.</p>
<p>He favors more heavily arming terrorist fighters. They&#8217;re getting plenty of weapons already. He wants no-fly zone protection implemented.</p>
<p>Doing so&#8217;s an act of war. It&#8217;s illegal without Security Council authorization. So is meddling in Syria&#8217;s internal affairs politically, economically, and/or militarily (directly or indirectly).</p>
<p>McCain&#8217;s dismissive of international law. So are other congressional hawks. Dempsey said he favors &#8220;building a moderate opposition and supporting it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The question whether to support it with direct kinetic strikesâ¤|is a decision for our elected officials, not for the senior military leader of the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kinetic strikes refer to missiles, bombs, drone attacks, and other military initiatives.  According to Dempsey, they&#8217;re &#8220;under deliberation inside of our agencies of government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about Dempsey&#8217;s comments, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama always asks military commanders for options. It&#8217;s &#8220;true in an arena like Syria&#8221; and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s reviewing them, he added. According to Vice Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral James Winnefeld:</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a whole range of options that are out there. We are ready to act if we&#8217;re called on to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>These type comments aren&#8217;t new. Whether direct US intervention follows remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Senator Carl Levin wants it. He wants Syria bombed. He urged Obama to attack &#8220;airfields, airplanes and massed artillery.&#8221; He supports terrorist insurgent invaders. He does so shamelessly. More on him below.</p>
<p>Armed Services Committee members are considering whether to renominate Dempsey and Winnefield for second terms. McCain&#8217;s opposed.</p>
<p>Democrats have majority say. Expect both top commanders to be approved.</p>
<p>At the same time, anti-Assad forces are fighting each other. Extremist Al Nusra insurgents are clashing with Free Syria Army elements. Unity remains elusive.</p>
<p>Things escalated dramatically. Whether full-scale internecine conflict follows remains to be seen. If so, maybe each side will annihilate the other. That&#8217;s one way to wind things down.</p>
<p>On July 19, <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/al-qaeda-syria-threat-284/" target="_blank">Russia Today</a> headlined &#8220;Al Qaeda&#8217;s planned emirate in Syria is West&#8217;s own doing.&#8221; Syrians want a secular state.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda wants its own. Syrian unity is threatened. So far insurgent extremists lack enough strength to prevail.</p>
<p>Assad forces consistently rout them. Without US intervention, they don&#8217;t have a chance. They can prolong conflict.</p>
<p>They can cause many more deaths, injuries and displacements. They can&#8217;t prevail without Libya 2.0 help.</p>
<p>On July 17, London&#8217;s <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10186843/Army-chief-We-risk-war-with-Syria.html" target="_blank">Telegraph headlined</a> &#8220;Army chief: We risk war with Syria.&#8221;</p>
<p>General David Richards is UK outgoing armed forces chief. Britain must be prepared to &#8220;go to war&#8221; with Syria, he said. &#8220;(I)f you want to have the material impact on the Syrian regime&#8217;s calculations that some people seek&#8230;ground targets&#8221; must be &#8220;hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lack of international consensus on how to take this forward,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to cohere the opposition groups, but they are difficult to cohere because there are many different dimensions to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is work in progress. So I am very clear in my military advice to the government that we need to understand what the political objective is before we can sensibly recommend what military effort and forces should be applied to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is something we debate a lot, from the Prime Minister downwards. We also need to do this with our allies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allies have different views on the way ahead. Understandably there is a great reluctance to see Western boots on the ground in a place like Syria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wanted to have the material impact on the Syrian regime&#8217;s calculations that some people seek, a no fly zone per se is insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to be able, as we did successfully in Libya, to hit ground targets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to establish a ground control zone. You have to take out their air defences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You also have to make sure they can&#8217;t manoeuvre &#8211; which means you have to take out their tanks, and their armoured personnel carriers and all the other things that are actually doing the damage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to have the material effect that people seek you have to be able to hit ground targets and so you would be going to war if that is what you want to do.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is rightly a huge and important decision. There are many arguments for doing it, but there are many arguments for not doing so too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Syria&#8217;s situation is &#8220;highly complex,&#8221; he stressed. Escalated war risks cross-border conflict. It&#8217;s happening in Lebanon.</p>
<p>It could affect all Syria&#8217;s neighbors. Perhaps other regional states. The entire region could become embroiled. Global conflict could follow.</p>
<p>Richards knows the risks. So do other high-level military commanders. They&#8217;re warriors, not peacemakers.</p>
<p>Richards called himself a &#8220;moral soldier.&#8221; His remark is offensive. It&#8217;s oxymoronic on its face. He said Afghanistan&#8217;s a &#8220;good war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others know better. Benjamin Franklin said &#8220;(t)here is no such thing as a good war or a bad peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russia said it won&#8217;t let Assad be toppled militarily. It has strategic interests at stake. Perhaps it wants Syria to be Obama&#8217;s regional Waterloo.</p>
<p>Halting his imperial rampaging&#8217;s important. If Russia and China aren&#8217;t committed, who will be? United they stand the best chance. It&#8217;s time they stepped up to the plate and acted.</p>
<p>America wages wars on small nations. It prefers weaker ones it can roll over. It abstains from challenging more equal rivals militarily. Bullies operate that way.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter believes &#8220;America does not at the moment have a functioning democracy.&#8221; It never had one. Carter didn&#8217;t explain.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s pessimistic. He&#8217;s got good reason to be. He called Snowden&#8217;s leaks &#8220;beneficial.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thinks NSA spying undermines US credibility worldwide. It constitutes &#8220;the invasion of human rights and American privacy.&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;gone too far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think that the bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial.&#8221;</p>
<p>He criticized Obama&#8217;s policies earlier. He condemned his drone attacks. He called targeted assassinations lawless.</p>
<p>Imperial policies undermine America&#8217;s &#8220;role as the global champion of human rights,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;America&#8217;s violation of international human rights abets our enemies and alienates our friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>America lacks moral authority. It lost it multiple ways. Carter&#8217;s no saint. Compared to Obama, he looks that way.</p>
<p>A Final Comment</p>
<p>On July 18, Senators Carl Levin (D. MI) and Angus King (I. ME) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/syria-puts-us-national-interests-at-risk/2013/07/18/fd28d60e-eb2f-11e2-a301-ea5a8116d211_story.html" target="_blank">headlined</a> &#8220;For Syria, lessons from the Balkan war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levin chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. King serves on it with him. Both express hawkish views. They visited the region. They did so for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>They deplore peace. They support escalated war. They may get what they wish for. They&#8217;ll be accountable for lots more blood on their hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the United States should join with its partners and allies in the region and elsewhere to pursue an end to the bloodshed,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;An international coalition that strengthens the military and political capabilities of thoroughly vetted anti-Assad forces should supply equipment and training.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That coalition should also plan for steps that would place even greater military pressure on the Assad regime, including possible strikes against the missiles, aircraft and other heavy weapons that are the instruments of Assad’s campaign of terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both senators know Washington directly aids Al Qaeda and other extremist groups. They&#8217;re supplied weapons, funding, training and direction. It&#8217;s been ongoing since conflict began. CIA and US special forces are involved. It&#8217;s an open secret.</p>
<p>Levin and King believe the best way to end war is wage more of it. They believe war is peace. They stop short of recommending US boots on the ground. Perhaps they will later. Who knows?</p>
<p>No matter the risks involved, they said, &#8220;the costs of inaction are equally high. Assad&#8217;s survival, with support from Iran and Hezbollah, would surely strengthen them, to our great detriment.&#8221;</p>
<p>They barely stopped short of urging regional war against nonexistent threats.</p>
<p>They blame Assad for Washington&#8217;s crimes. It&#8217;s standard imperial duplicity. Obama bears full responsibility. Don&#8217;t expect them to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;â¤|.US national interests are at stake,&#8221; they claim. So are neighboring countries &#8220;Israel, Turkey and Jordan.&#8221;</p>
<p>They propose international action against Assad. They want &#8220;a comprehensive strategy&#8221; agreed on as soon as possible.</p>
<p>They want all-out war. They want it against an independent, nonbelligerent sovereign state. They ignore inviolable international law principles.</p>
<p>They turned truth on its head, saying:</p>
<p>A &#8220;widespread insurgency has strong popular support.&#8221;</p>
<p>False! The vast majority of Syrians support Assad. Independent polls show it. The longer conflict persists, the more his support grows.</p>
<p>Syrians depend on him for whatever protection he can provide. When Syrian forces liberate insurgent held areas, residents express gratitute openly.</p>
<p>Levin and King want America to &#8220;help the Syrian people end the senseless slaughter they are suffering&#8221; by inflicting more of it.</p>
<p>They, likeminded congressional members, Obama, and complicit administration officials reflect diabolical forces of evil. They&#8217;re unmatched in human history.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re waging war on humanity. Perhaps they believe the best way to save it is destroy it.</p>
<p>They support permanent war. They want unchallenged US global dominance. They&#8217;ll stop at nothing to achieve it.</p>
<p>Imagine the worst ahead. They endorse what&#8217;s likely coming. Survival&#8217;s up for grabs.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/GiulioAndreotti3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/GiulioAndreotti2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Almost two months have passed since the death of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Andreotti">Giulio Andreotti</a>, arguably the most powerful politician in Italy&#8217;s post-World War II history. In recent weeks I have struggled with a draft obituary of this complex man who deserves to be better known abroad, but the task proved daunting. There are too many loose ends, strange events, and unexplained mysteries in Andreotti&#8217;s long life that require detailed expert knowledge of the setting and <i>dramatis personae,</i> harking all the way back to the Fascist era; so I&#8217;ve asked Slobodan Janković, a research fellow at Belgrade’s Institute of International Politics and Economy, an alumnus of Rome’s <a href="http://en.uniroma1.it/">La Sapienza</a> and a leading expert on Italian politics, to help me tell the story.</p>
<p>That story needs to start with Italy’s current predicament. Since April 28 the country has had a new government, headed by “a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Monti">Mario Monti</a>,” Enrico Letta (46). This man, oddly charmless for an Italian, is a fanatical Eurocrat, a participant in the deliberations of the <a href="http://www.ilfoglio.it/soloqui/18364">Trilateral Commission</a>, an associate of the <a href="http://popoff.globalist.it/Detail_News_Display?ID=72694">Bilderberg Group</a>, and vise-president of <a href="http://247.libero.it/focus/25388291/41/enrico-letta-il-giovane-dc-che-deve-far-da-paciere-tra-pd-e-pdl">the Aspen Institute in Italy</a>; in other words, a member of the globalist elite <i>par excellence</i>. As a prominent leader of Italy’s “center-left,” in 2006-2007 he was Secretary to the Council of Ministers in the second <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodi_II_Cabinet">Prodi Cabinet</a>. (Interestingly, he was preceded and succeeded in that post by his uncle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Letta">Gianni Letta</a>, a stalwart Berlusconi loyalist.)</p>
<p>Having started his political career in 1990 in the youth organization of the Italian Christian Democrats, Enrico Letta quickly rose to the presidency of the youth division of the European People’s Party (EPP), a conservative bloc in the European Parliament. By the mid-1990’s, however, he moved to the <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partito_Popolare_Italiano_%281994-2002%29">Partito Popolare Italiano</a>, which marked his decisive turn to the left following the collapse of <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrazia_Cristiana">Christian Democracy</a> (DC). At 31 he became the PPI’s deputy leader. Within years he joined a motley crew of ex-communists and leftists to form the <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Ulivo">Ulivo</a>  (olive tree) party, on whose list he was elected first to the European Parliament and then to the Italian parliament, before rising to the senior government post under Prodi. In 2007, Ulivo joined the former communists to form the Democratic Party (PD). Once again, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/enrico-letta-asked-to-form-italian-government-a-896341.html">Letta was in the middle of the action</a>, as <i>Der Spiegel’s</i> commentator has noted; but when he set out to become party leader, he was badly beaten: “When it came time to tally the ballots—which were filled out not only by party members but by all interested citizens—he ended up with just 11 percent, putting him in third and last place. His victorious rival Walter Veltroni received about 75 percent of the vote. By the time he was nominated … for Rome’s top political office, he had more or less put his career in party politics behind him.”</p>
<p>Letta’s career indicates the extent to which Italy is ruled by men who are devoid of popular support, whose sole ideology is power, and who are servile to supranational interest groups in order to enjoy the privileges that come with such servility. As Slobodan Janković says, how else can we explain the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Bonino">Emma Bonino</a> was first considered for the post of the President of Italy, and then on April 28 was appointed the country’s foreign minister, in spite of her crushing defeat in the general election of February 24-25, when her list <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_Bonino_Pannella#Risultati_elettorali">received one-fifth of one percent (0.20%) of the popular vote</a>? How can someone so odious to Italy’s voters be in the race for presidency, and then receive a key cabinet post? “Maybe for that very reason,” according to Janković. “Perhaps this was the way to give yet another European nation a slap in the face, to tell that nation that such choices are not made by her people but by someone else.” Bonino’s appointment was suggested by another protégé of the transnational elite, <a href="http://www.corsiadeiservi.it/ita/default1.asp?page_id=1597">former prime minister Mario Monti</a>.</p>
<p>This was a strange choice, coming from the man who last February headed an electoral list that included the remnant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_the_Centre_%282008%29">the Christian Democratic</a> remnant. “Bonino is a prominent hater of life,” Janković points out. “She was Italy’s leading advocate of free abortion on demand in the 1970’s, ostentatiously taking part in illegal abortions well before the procedure was made lawful in 1978, and gloating that she’d have a good laugh while throwing fetuses into trash.” Bonino was arrested once, having been caught red handed while performing ‘vacuumization’ with a bicycle pump, <a href="http://marcorespinti.blogspot.com/2010/01/emma-bonino-exposedto-pro-life-america.html">but was let off scot free. She went into politics</a> instead of going to jail, making a name for herself as an advocate of “LGBT rights,” euthanasia, and legalization of hard drugs. Far from being <a href="http://apocalisselaica.net/fuori-tema/politica/governo-emma-bonino-la-radicale-ribelle-guida-la-farnesina">“a radical rebel,”</a> Bonino soon became a <a href="http://www.polisblog.it/post/83101/bilderberg-cose">participant in the Bilderberg Group meetings</a>, a friend of George Soros, and the recipient of his Open Society Foundation’s annual award for 2004. Bonino’s career is but one of countless examples of Italy’s multifaceted decline, Janković says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If the process of Italy’s transformation from a traditional Roman Catholic country into the current spiritually and materially devastated land is to be linked to a single name, that name is <i>Giulio Andreotti . . . </i>The life-long Senator died last May 6, and took many secrets to the grave. For decades he was the <i>éminence grise</i> of Italian politics, helping make it what it is today. On top of that, there is ample evidence that for much of his political career Andreotti was the true <i>capo di tutti capi</i>.“</p></blockquote>
<p>The extent of Andreotti&#8217;s power is incomprehensible without some grasp of the remarkable influence of Freemasonry, first on the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/504489/Risorgimento">Risorgimento</a>, and later on the political, economic and social life of modern Italy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>, the founder of Young Italy and the prophet of Risorgimento, became a mason as a student and died a 33rd degree master. An early advocate of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_Europe"><i>United States of Europe</i></a>, in 1831 Mazzini joined the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonari">Carbonari</a>, a secret society dedicated to Italy’s unification, which was strongly anti-Catholic and organized in the fashion of Masonic lodges. His vision of a future united Italy was reflected in the crude mockery of Christian rites he staged at the Vatican on Easter Sunday 1849.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a> was the best known grand master of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Orient_of_Italy">Grand Orient of Italy</a>, receiving the highest, 33rd degree of initiation in 1864. His landing in Messina, and <a href="http://livepage.apple.com/">his subsequent conquest of Sicily and the South</a>, would not have been possible without the help of local British masons among the merchant expatriate community, and the <a href="http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/il-sud-e-i-conflitti-sociali_(L'Unificazione)">support from The Royal Navy</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Rome">capture of Rome</a> in 1870 was the moment of triumph of Freemasonry over the Catholic Church. The pope was confined to the walls of the Vatican, and the new Kingdom became part-Masonic El Dorado, part-Tammany Hall.</p>
<p>The Vatican’s reconciliation with the Italian state became possible only after 1925, when Mussolini simultaneously and successfully clamped down on rural banditry in the South and <a href="http://storia.camera.it/cronologia/leg-regno-XXVII/elenco">outlawed Freemasonry</a>. The latter paved the way for the Concordat of 1929. As Janković points out, at the time of the Concordat for the first time since the fall of the Western Roman Empire Italy had a strong central power—but Italian Freemason émigrés did not give up: “In the 1930’s they regrouped in exile. One of their leaders, <a href="http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/interni/randolfo-pacciardi-padre-repubblica-maledetto-dai-partiti-856892.html">Randolfo Pacciardi</a> (a 30th degree initiate) went to Spain in 1937 to lead the Italian battalion Garibaldi, an important unit within the notorious International Brigades which fought Franco’s forces.”</p>
<p>After the Spanish Civil War Pacciardi repeatedly visited the United States. After 1945 he was a prominent member of four successive Italian governments, most of that time as defense minister (1948-1953). In that capacity he arranged Italy’s entry into NATO, campaigned against monarchy, and enthusiastically supported the country’s accession to the European Coal and Steel Community. In these endeavors he worked closely with two fellow Masons who spent the war years in the United States, foreign minister <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Sforza">Carlo Sforza</a> and Italy’s first postwar ambassador in Washington <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Tarchiani">Alberto Tarchiani</a>.</p>
<p>“It is widely assumed that the Allied landing in Sicily was carried out in coordination with the Mafia.” Janković says, “It defies logic that an organization thoroughly suppressed by Mussolini could play a significant role, yet it did because the Americans wanted it that way.” Had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/07/obituaries/biagio-m-corvo-74-intelligence-officer-during-world-war-ii.html">Biaggio Max Corvo</a> had his way, Janković adds, this would not have happened. Born in Sicily but raised in the United States since the age of 8, Corvo volunteered for the U.S Army in 1941 and on his own initiative drew up plans for operations against Mussolini. His work impressed senior officers, and he was soon transferred to the Italian Secret Intelligence branch of the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA. A devout Catholic and a life-long antifascist, in addition to rejecting contacts with the Mafia, Corvo was also opposed to cooperation with the Masonic <i>Mazziniani—</i>the approach favored by the British—or with the Communist-dominated resistance forces. He established links with the Catholic secret group <a href="http://www.faqs.org/espionage/Vo-Z/World-War-II-The-Surrender-of-the-Italian-Army.html">Pro Deo (founded in Portugal in 1941)</a> instead, and maintained friendly relations with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Sturzo">Don Luigi Sturzo</a>, the 1919 founder of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_People%27s_Party_%281919%E2%80%931926%29">Italian People’s Party</a> (<i>Partito Popolare Italiano</i>, PPI), who spent the war in exile in the U.S. Through his Vatican connections Corvo even managed to contact Japanese diplomats who had realized that their country was doomed and wanted to establish channels of communication with the U.S.; but in early 1945 Washington severed the link. According to Janković,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Young Corvo was rewarded for his work with the papal Lateran Cross, but he had powerful enemies on both sides of the Atlantic. The British <a href="http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/07/20/uno-007-in-sicilia.html">preempted his efforts to save Mussolini’s life in April 1945</a> and to obtain the trove of documents the fallen dictator was carrying on his person during that doomed trip north. Yes, the story of the British-American rivalry in Italy in the final days of the Second World War <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servizio_informazioni_militare">is yet to be told</a>. In the United States Corvo’s enemies included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Dulles">Allen Dulles</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jesus_Angleton">James Jesus Angleton</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence">the Office of Naval Intelligence</a>, which unabashedly cultivated the Mafia connection. In 1943 the ONI released 850 Mafia members imprisoned by Mussolini in Palermo, and subsequently relied on the advice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luciano">Lucky Luciano</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calogero_Vizzini">Calogero Vizzini</a> in political and personnel matters.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Other trusties, who became <i>uomini d’onore</i> after the war, included personal translator to Col. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Poletti">Charles Poletti</a>, the 46th governor of New York and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army">U.S. Army</a> civil affairs officer in Italy. This was none other than “don” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Genovese">Vito Genovese</a>, who had fled New York in the 1930s to escape prosecution for murder and subsequently became <i>il capo di tuti capi</i>. Another was <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08602/4899A1645A24D8A33C75DB4810DA8276C9C771F7.html">Max Mugniano</a>, who was placed in charge of all U.S. Army medical warehouses in Italy at a time when penicillin was worth many times its weight in gold (as per <i>The Third Man</i>), and who subsequently became Luciano’s superintendant of the narcotics trade.</p>
<p>The Mafia was backin action, after two lean decades under Mussolini. In Italy’s 1947 Peace Treaty with the Allies, a short but highly significant provision—Article 16—was inserted almost as an afterthought: “Italy shall not prosecute or molest Italian nationals, including members of the armed forces, solely on the ground that during the period from June 10, 1940, to the coming into force of the present Treaty, they expressed sympathy with or took action in support of the cause of the Allied and Associated Powers.” Of course “including members of the armed forces” was just a smokescreen. The real benefactors were the “sympathizers” and “activists” in the Allied cause, like Genovese, Mugniano, their 850 cohorts from the Palermo jail, and many other persons south of Naples, known and unknown. The Italian authorities were prevented from seeing, let alone vetting, the names of those “Italian nationals” protected by the Treaty.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/2010/09/03/cultura/lettere-compromettenti-ecco-perchechurchill-ordino-l-uccisi">Mussolini’s murder</a>, which was carried out by communists but <a href="http://livepage.apple.com/">arranged by the British</a>, power was taken by an uneasy alliance of Christian Democrats and Freemasons—the latter group including Pacciardi, the International Brigades commander who duly became a born-again anticommunist. The party&#8217;s leader was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcide_De_Gasperi">Alcide De Gasperi</a>, one of the founders of what is today the European Union. A veteran leader of the Popular Party after the Great War, persecuted by the fascist regime, De Gasperi recruited a student by the name of Giulio Andreotti into the ranks of the semi-clandestine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Catholic_Federation_of_University_Students">Italian Catholic Federation of University Students</a> (<i>Federazione Universitaria Cattolica Italiana</i>, FUCI) in 1941. According to Andreotti&#8217;s account, they met by chance in the Vatican Library, where De Gasperi worked at the time, and Andreotti was looking for some books. The Federation&#8217;s president was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Moro">Aldo Moro</a>, a young lecturer in law and devout Catholic from Apulia. When Moro was drafted into the Italian army in 1942, Cardinal Cesare Montini—who was to become pope Paul VI—supported De Gasperi’s suggestion that Andreotti be appointed to the newly vacant post.</p>
<p>In the turbulent months of 1945 De Gasperi appointed Andreotti to the provisional National Advisory Council, the precursor of Italy’s republican parliament. In 1947, at the age of 28, Andreotti became a junior minister in the prime minister’s office. In that position he had more real power and patronage than some cabinet members. “It caused envy in other politicians,” he later remembered, which caused them to wonder about the source of his power. Even as a young man, he struck others as cynical and devoid of passion. His un-Italian disdain of grimaces and gestures helped cultivate the image of focused power. His sardonic quips could be viciously funny, mostly at other people’s expense. Aloof and secretive, he was disliked by his peers but respected by the senior party leaders as a hard worker. He was elected to the Constitutional Assembly in 1947 and remained a member of parliament for 66 years; he died as a senator-for-life. Andreotti stayed as De Gasperi’s undersecretary in several successive governments (1947-1954), when at the age of 34 he became minister of the interior. In the ensuing decades he occupied one ministerial post or another 27 times, eight times as minister of defense. He was Italy’s prime minister an unprecedented seven times, known as <i>divo Giulio</i> to friends and enemies alike—not because he was touched by divine grace, but because he was inordinately powerful. As Andreotti acquired reputation for sinister dealings, his foes dubbed him <i>Beelzebub</i>. “Giulio is so capable in everything,” De Gasperi said in the late 1940’s, “that he could become capable of anything.” Many decades later Margaret Thatcher wrote in her memoirs that Andreotti “seemed to have a positive aversion to principle.”</p>
<p><a href="http://archivio900.globalist.it/it/nomi/nom.aspx?id=1481">Aldo Moro</a> was a different type of person: deeply but unostentatiously pious, witty, scholarly. He survived the war and <a href="http://storia.camera.it/deputato/aldo-moro-19160923/gruppi#nav">returned to politics</a>, while initially maintaining a teaching position at the University of Bari. (Andreotti, by contrast, had no fall-back professional option: all his life he was a full-time politician.) Moro also was destined to occupy influential posts in the years to come. He, too, was a deputy of the constituent assembly and a lawmaker until his early death. He became head of the Christian Democrat parliamentary group in 1953, DC party secretary (1959-1964), and president from July 1976 until his murder in 1978. He was Italy’s prime minister five times. “The two men came to embody two faces of Italy’s Christian Democracy,” Janković says, “as well as Italy’s two divergent post-war paths”:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Moro was a statesman and a patriot. In the 1950’s he put together a team of men focused on Italy’s development, on her industrialization and technological advance, and who were committed to enhancing her weight and reputation in international affairs. Moro was also a Catholic traditionalist—a political moderate and economic reformer, but culturally a conservative. Andreotti was opposed to Moro’s strategy of state-guided economic recovery, favoring foreign private investors instead. He was an economic ‘neoliberal’ in the 1950’s-60’s meaning of the term. He also opposed the 1962 Christian Democratic-Socialist (DC-PSI) coalition, which gave Italy over a decade of relative stability and unprecedented prosperity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Moro’s policy of creating large public enterprises, especially in the energy sector, was the foundation of Italy’s economic miracle. The banks were encouraged to provide easy credit to domestic investors, with the central bank (<i>Banca d’Italia</i>) playing an active role. Between 1951 and 1972 Italy&#8217;s average <a href="http://livepage.apple.com/">growth rate was 5.3 percent</a>, slightly below that in Germany (5.7 percent) but well above that in Britain and the United States. The DC-PSI coalition reformed the dysfunctional taxation system, secured years of industrial peace through long-term agreements with the unions, and put Italy on the map as a global economic player.</p>
<p>By the early 1960&#8242;s Andreotti emerged as the informal leader of opposition to Moro’s strategy on the Christian Democratic “right.” Heavily Masonic in composition, Andreotti’s wing of the party included individuals connected with large multinational corporations, especially in the energy sector. There is strong evidence that some of these people were involved in the murder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Mattei">Enrico Mattei</a> in 1962. A Catholic resistance veteran, in 1945 Mattei was put in charge of dismantling the state petroleum company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agip">Agip</a> (<i>Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli</i>), founded by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism">Fascist</a> regime in 1926. He changed his mind about the project, however, when he realized that several U.S. oil companies were eagerly waiting to grab Agip’s assets for a song. Mattei <a href="http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/a1951.htm">reorganized the company</a> into the National Fuel Trust (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eni"><i>Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi</i></a><i>,</i> ENI) instead. Under his direction ENI negotiated key oil concessions in the Middle East and a drilling agreement with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a>, all of which helped break the previous stranglehold of the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sisters_%28oil_companies%29">Seven Sisters</a>” (a term he coined to refer to the dominant oil companies) on the oil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry">industry</a>. To the multinationals’ horror, Mattei also inaugurated the ENI rule that any country in which it operated would receive 75 percent of the profits. This secured important concessions in Iran and North Africa. By the late 1950’s ENI was competing with giants like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esso">Esso</a> and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell">Shell</a>. In 1960, after concluding the agreement with the Soviet Union and while negotiating with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>, Mattei publicly declared that the American oil monopoly was over.</p>
<p>On October 27, 1962 on a flight from Catania to Milan, Mattei’s executive jet crashed and all three men on board were killed: Mattei, his pilot, and an American journalist. <b>The official inquiry—personally overseen by Giulio Andreotti, Italy’s defense minister at the time—declared it “an accident.” </b>It is now known that crucial evidence was immediately destroyed at the crash site, and all flight instruments were dissolved in acid. In October 1995, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhumation">exhumation</a> of Mattei’s remains resulted in the discovery of metal debris fragments—indicative of an explosion—embedded deep in his bones. In 2005 the incident was reclassified as homicide, with perpetrator(s) unknown.</p>
<p>(An additional mystery connected with this case remains unresolved. While working on the documentary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mattei_Affair"><i>The Mattei Affair</i></a> in 1970, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Rosi">Francesco Rosi</a> asked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro_De_Mauro">Mauro De Mauro</a>, a prominent investigative journalist, to join the project. De Mauro soon obtained what he termed important evidence about Mattei’s final days, but disappeared eight days later without a trace. His body has never been found. Several investigators involved in the search for De Mauro were later killed, including the Carabinieri general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Alberto_Dalla_Chiesa">Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa</a>.)</p>
<p>Mattei’s murder did not interrupt Italy’s longest period of calm and prosperity in modern history. Starting in 1969, however, a wave of terrorist attacks hit the country, allegedly perpetrated by the far left or the far right. Most of them remain unresolved to this day. Two fascists were convicted in 1995 of planting a bomb at the railway station in Bologna <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_massacre">which killed 85 people and wounded 200</a> others in August 1980. We still do not know who ordered the attack and with what motive in mind. We do know that the probe was side-tracked for 15 years by Andreotti’s associate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licio_Gelli">Licio Gelli</a>, who later gained notoriety as the grand master of the secretive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due">Propaganda Due</a> (P2) masonic lodge. In November 23, 1995, Italy’s Court of Cassation convicted  Gelli and three other Masons, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Pazienza">Francesco Pazienza</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SISMI">SISMI</a> officers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Musumeci">Pietro Musumeci</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Giuseppe_Belmonte&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Giuseppe Belmonte</a>, of obstructing investigation into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Massacre">Bologna Massacre</a>. (“He was a politician highly trained and honest, ready to tackle the tasks that were entrusted to us,” <a href="http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/personaggi/1236468/Morte-Andreotti--Licio-Gelli---Un-vero-uomo-porta-i-segreti-nella-tomba--.html">Gelli (93) said upon learning of Andreotti’s death.</a> “He knew how to keep the secrets that were entrusted to him. Andreotti did his duty, using the secrets to promote the well-being of the people. He kept the secrets, and he took them with him. What a man…”)</p>
<p>One of those secrets concerns Andreotti’s role in setting up and developing a clandestine NATO “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-behind">stay-behind</a>” network in Italy during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a> known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">Operation Gladio</a>. The role of the CIA in sponsoring Gladio and its involvement in terrorist attacks during Italy’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_Lead_%28Italy%29"><i>Years of Lead</i></a> remains contentious. The origin of the operation itself is not: it was based on confidential “NATO protocols,” committing the secret services of all member states to prevent communist parties from coming to power. A briefing minute of June 1, 1959, reveals that Gladio, “in case of a Soviet military invasion,” would organize resistance by internal subversion. More significantly, it was to play “a determining role&#8230; also in the politics of emergency.” Secret arms arsenals were set up and personnel recruited and sworn to secrecy.</p>
<p>Giulio Andreotti, Italy’s defense minister at the time of the 1959 memorandum, denied “unequivocally” Gladio’s existence under oath on two occasions—in 1974 and 1978—to judges investigating the 1969 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Fontana_bombing">Piazza Fontana bombing</a>. On October 24, 1990, as Prime Minister, Andreotti finally acknowledged Gladio’s existence to the Chamber of Deputies; by that time it had ceased to be a secret. In his admission Andreotti described Gladio as a “structure of information, response and safeguard,” with arms caches and reserve officers. He gave the parliamentary commission in charge of investigations on bombings, a list of 622 civilians who were allegedly part of Gladio; but the list subsequently proved to be incomplete. Andreotti said that 127 arms depots had been dismantled.</p>
<p>Following the revelation, the P2 Lodge treasurer, General Siro Rosetti, launched a spirited defense of Gladio’s concept and importance. Later that year, a decade after the Bologna massacre, Judge Libero Mancuso—who had led the investigation and secured the initial convictions of the bombers—broke his silence to the (London) <i>Guardian</i>: “We [investigators] are isolated, and the objects of a campaign of aggression. This is what has happened to the commission into the P2, and to the magistrates. The personal risks to us are small in comparison to this offensive of denigration, which attempts to discredit the quest for truth. In Italy there has functioned for some years now a sort of conditioning, a control of our national sovereignty by the P2—which was literally the master of the secret services, the army and our most delicate organs of state.”</p>
<p>In the course of his 1990 admission, Andreotti assured the deputies that Gladio had not been involved in any of the terrorist attacks. A decade later, however, in 2000, the Italian Senate published a report which stated that “[t]hose massacres, bombs, and military actions had been organized or promoted or supported by men inside Italian state institutions and, as has been discovered more recently, by men linked to the structures of United States intelligence.” The report claimed that US intelligence agents were informed in advance about several attacks, including the December 1969 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Fontana_bombing">Piazza Fontana bombing</a> in Milan and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_della_Loggia_bombing">Piazza della Loggia bombing</a> in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place.</p>
<p>General Gianadelio Maletti, commander of the counter-intelligence section of the Italian military intelligence service from 1971 to 1975, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/mar/26/terrorism">told the March 2001 Piazza Fontana bombings trial</a> that the CIA had foreknowledge of the event and approved terrorismas a means of preventing Italy’s leftward slide. “Don&#8217;t forget that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Nixon</a> was in charge. “Maletii added, “and Nixon was a peculiar man, a very intelligent politician but a man of rather unorthodox initiatives.” Slobodan Janković does not consider such claims too far fetched:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The U.S. elite did not look with approval on the Italian economic model. Its financial interests were threatened outside Italy as well, especially by ENI’s expansion. The Americans tried to smear Moro by implicating him in the Lockheed bribes scandal, but he successfully defended himself in the court of law. More dangerous than public slanders were threats, especially when coming from people capable of carrying them out. According to the 1980 testimony by Moro’s widow to the parliamentary commission of investigation, during a visit to Washington in 1974 <a href="http://www.storiain.net/arret/num114/artic4.asp">Moro was openly warned not to pursue his policy of “historic compromise”</a> with the Left, or else he’d ‘pay a price.’ Moro paid that price on March 16, 1978, when he was kidnapped and all five of his bodyguards killed in an attack allegedly carried out by the Red Brigades. His body was found on May 9 in the trunk of a car. The kidnappers, according to the official version, saw Moro as a symbol of ‘imperialism’ who deserved punishment, but nothing could have been further from the truth. Moro was a patriot, a Catholic, a statesman and a family man. On the day of his kidnapping a new government, headed by Giulio Andreotti, was supposed to be formed. This was eventually done, but because of Moro’s kidnapping the <i>historic compromise</i> was abandoned.”</p></blockquote>
<p>During his seven-week captivity, Aldo Moro wrote several letters to various political figures, including Andreotti. In October 1990, a cache of previously unknown letters was discovered in a Milan apartment which had once been used as a Red Brigade hideout. One of those letters made reference to the involvement of both NATO and the CIA in an Italian-based secret “parallel army.” That safe house had been searched at the time of Moro’s death by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Alberto_Dalla_Chiesa">Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa</a>, the head of counter-terrorism division who was put in charge of investigating the kidnapping. Dalla Chiesa was murdered in 1982.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Aldo_Moro">Moro’s kidnapping and murder</a> were also investigated by a government committee under the guidance of then-prime minister Giulio Andreotti. It included the heads of two security agencies (General Santovito of SISMI and General Grassini of SISDE) and the commander of the Financial Police (Guardia della Finanza), General <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffaele_Giudice">Raffaele Giudice</a>. All three of them were <a href="http://www.loggiap2.com/lista_ad_oggi%20_conosciuta_in_ordine_per_fascicolo">members of P2</a>. The only service chief who was not a Mason, Prefect Gaetano Napoletano of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CESIS">CESIS</a>, was removed by Andreotti in the early stages of investigation and <a href="http://www.paginaitaliana.de/moro/moro_resoconto.html">replaced by yet another</a> P2 member, General Walter Pelosi. The committee proceeded to make several spectacular lapses. One of them was the fact that telephone lines suddenly went down in the area where Moro and his escort were passing—five minutes before the attack—and came back to normal half an hour later. This caused a delay in alerting the authorities to the attack. Director-General of SIP (the telephone company) was <a href="http://www.zeusnews.it/index.php3?ar=stampa&amp;cod=4948&amp;tipo=edi">Michele Principe</a>, yet another P2 member. The police commissar in charge of liaison with SIP was <a href="http://antonella.beccaria.org/tag/antonio-esposito">Antonio Esposito</a>—yes, you’ve guessed it, also a P2 member. Furthermore, years later it became known that someone at the SIP switchboard prevented the <a href="http://www.fisicamente.net/MEMORIA/index-1719.htm">monitoring of phone calls</a> which the kidnapers were making to Moro’s family.</p>
<p>Immediately following Moro’s death, investigative journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mino_Pecorelli">Mino Pecorelli</a> wrote that Dalla Chiesa was in danger and would be assassinated. He drew a connection between Gladio and Moro’s death. Pecorelli, who was on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licio_Gelli">Licio Gelli</a>’s list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due">P2 members</a> discovered in 1980 but had fallen out with Gelli before Moro’s death, was assassinated on March 20, 1979. It was immediately suspected that Pecorelli’s murder was <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/propeco/andreotti/andreotti.html">related</a> to the Prime Minister, but there was no proof. Almost two decades later, when a former Mafia member <a href="http://web.tiscali.it/almanaccodeimisteri/andreotti26.htm">testified that Andreotti had ordered the hit</a>, the aging senator-for-life was charged and brought to trial. <b>In 2002 Andreotti was sentenced to 24 years in prison for his role in the murder</b>. That sentence was overturned by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Cassation_%28Italy%29">Supreme Court of Appeals</a>, however; he never went to jail.</p>
<p>Two days after Moro’s kidnapping and the formation of a new government, Licio Gelli (b. 1919) <a href="http://inchieste.repubblica.it/it/repubblica/rep-it/2012/05/16">gathered in Rome</a> the representatives of all 496 Grant Orient Loges of Italy. Gelli was confirmed as Italy’s grand master and as leader of the more secretive and influential P2. Gelli, known under the nickname <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfagor_arcidiavolo"><i>Belfagor</i></a>, was a fascist in his youth, a double (German-communist) agent during the war, a U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) asset after the war, and a key man in setting up Operation Gladio. In his diaries (<i>Diari 1976-1979) </i>Andreotti mentions meeting Gelli in the aftermath of Moro’s murder—but only to discuss Latin America! The security services appear to have had no active files on Gelli, which seems unbelievable in view of his prominence and activities. Some of his files were likely burned in 1974, when Andreotti ordered the destruction of 157,000 personal dossiers. Only the Financial Police kept three reports on active file, concerning Gelli’s illegal arms deals in the Middle East and South America and his contacts with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junio_Valerio_Borghese">Junio Valerio Borghese</a>’s banned far-right group, prior to the latter’s mysterious death in Spain in 1974. Of the four investigators who composed those reports, one was murdered, one committed suicide, one went into early retirement&#8230; and one joined Gelli’s P2 Lodge.</p>
<p>When asked in 2009, about his links with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/20/giulio-andreotti">the P2</a>, Andreotti replied. “Ah, yes… That strange lodge—Gelli’s one.” The <i>Guardian’s </i>reporter was stunned: “He said it distractedly, with the air of a man recalling the bridge circle he had once heard was run by the wife of the friend of a very distant cousin. You would never have thought the revelation of the P2’s activities infused Italian politics with scandal for years—years in which Andreotti was a leading player, if not the leading player, on the political scene.” He denied being a mason, although the wife of Roberto Calvi, the banker found mysteriously hanged under Blackfriars Bridge in 1982, testified that he was. More than just a member, in fact: “he was accused of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/20/giulio-andreotti">being the hidden string puller</a> behind the lodge [P2] to which Calvi belonged.”</p>
<p>The most damaging, and most extensively proven accusations against Andreotti concerned his links to organized crime. An early connection concerned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Lima">Salvatore “Salvo” Lima</a>, described in the final report of the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimafia_Commission">Antimafia Commission</a> (1963–1976) as one of the pillars of mafia power in Palermo. Developing his political career in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democracy_%28Italy%29">DC</a> that began in the 1950s, Lima became close to Andreotti in 1964. He was often referred to as Andreotti’s “proconsul” in Sicily and once held a junior cabinet post, which resulted in the ministry’s most senior civil servant resigning in protest. In 1992 Lima was shot dead by a Mafia assassin, presumably for failing to deliver on some pledges. Years later the <i>Guardian’s</i> John Hooper <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/20/giulio-andreotti">put it to Andreotti</a> that he must have known he was dealing indirectly with the mafia. “But Lima never spoke to me about these things” Andreotti replied. “A lot of people in Sicily have links with the mafia. That isn’t just true of the Christian Democrats, but of others.” “Lima never spoke to me about these things” did not sound like an overly spirited denial, especially for a man of Andreotti’s experience and acumen.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s a string of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mafia">mafia</a> informers emerged to testify that Andreotti had been Cosa Nostra’s protector in Rome, known as “uncle Giulio.” Andreotti was charged and the judges ruled that, prior to 1980, there had been “concrete collaboration” between Andreotti and the mafia, which “induced its members to feel protected at the highest level.” He was not convicted or sentenced because his crimes were covered by a statute of limitations. “The only thing they haven’t said about me,” Andreotti quipped years later, “is that I’m a freemason.” It would be funny, but for the trail of bodies and corruption which <i>il Divo</i> had left in his wake.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangentopoli">Tangentopoli</a> scandal and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_Pulite"><i>Mani Pulite</i></a> (“Clean Hands”) investigation, Italy’s affairs passed into the “capable” hands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Amato">Giuliano Amato</a>—now retired on a $40,000 monthly pension—and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Draghi">Mario Draghi</a>, now head of the European Central Bank. Eurofanatics and blind followers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus">Washington Consensus</a>, in the 1990’s they carried out a privatization plan as catastrophic for Italy’s economy as anything seen east of the Iron Curtain following the collapse of communism. A century and a half after Italy shook off first Austrian rule and French tutelage, it still proved vulnerable to the <i>vincolo esterno</i>, the external constraint—this time to the international bankers, Brussels bureaucrats, and the IMF.</p>
<p>Berlusconi’s three terms as prime minister did not change much. He had failed to create, enact and apply a bold vision of Italy for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. <a href="http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/2011/11/09/the-end-of-the-berlusconi-era">As I wrote in 2011,</a> his private peccadilloes and dubious business practices could have been overlooked had he not left Italy, after almost ten years in office, in no better state than he found her in 1994:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The economy is grotesquely over-regulated, yet the old system of corrupt government contracts and phony jobs for the well-connected is alive and well. The central bureaucratic machine is as bloated and inefficient as ever. An estimated third of potential tax revenues remain uncollected. Italy is, in terms of growth, the sick man of Europe: only Zimbabwe and Haiti had lower GDP growth than Italy in 2000-2010. The public debt, at $2.6 trillion, is 120% of GDP. A quarter of Italy’s under-30s are unemployed and another quarter is subsisting on dead-end, 1,000 euros-per-month jobs in mamma’s care, thus contributing to a demographic collapse far worse than that in Central and Northern Europe. There was no improvement in productivity under Berlusconi: Italy’s international competitiveness has actually declined over the past decade. Public spending has been outstripping growth for years; since 2009, it has accounted for more than one-half of the GDP.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Slobodan Janković’s assessment is also grim: “Between 1945 and 1992 there were many ranking Italians of professional and personal integrity at all levels of the state and society who were prepared to risk much, even their lives, in the struggle against organized crime, secret societies, and power centers connected to foreign political and financial interests. In the present era of Monti, Letta and Bonino, however, the patriots and traditional Catholics have no power and no voice.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/08/world/europe/berlusconi-profile">Berlusconi</a>’s seven-year prison sentence for abusing power and having sex with an underage prostitute changes nothing. He will appeal, the sentence will be overturned, and the current unnatural coalition will continue on its long road to nowhere in particular. The economy will continue to stagnate, and the process of moral and spiritual decay will continue to turn one of the most civilized countries in the world into a shadow of its former self.</p>
<p>Alas, poor Italy…</p>

Austerity measures aimed largely at the poor are being imposed on all the nations of the world. Weather events grow more deadly and brushfire wars more frequent. An AK-47 can be obtained for $49 in the markets of West Africa. The depopulation campaign of the inbred <i>Illuminati</i>bankers is accelerating.</p>
<p><b>In 1957 President Dwight Eisenhower</b>, who later warned of a “military-industrial complex”, commissioned a panel of scientists to study the issue of overpopulation. The scientists put forth Alternatives I, II and III, advocating both the release of deadly viruses and perpetual warfare as means to decrease world population.</p>
<p>The first supposition dovetailed nicely with the pharmaceutical interests of the Rockefellers. According to Nexus magazine, the Rockefellers own one-half of the US pharmaceutical industry, which would reap billions developing medicines to “battle” the deadly viruses about to be released.</p>
<p><b>In 1969 the Senate Church Committee discovered that the US Defense Department</b> (DOD) had requested a budget of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars for a program to speed development of new viruses which target and destroy the human immune system. DOD officials testified before Congress that they planned to produce, “a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could be acquired… Most important is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.” House Bill 5090 authorized the funds and MK-NAOMI was carried out at Fort Detrick, Maryland.</p>
<p>Out of this research came the AIDS virus which was targeted at “undesirable elements” of the population. The first AIDS viruses were administered through a massive smallpox vaccine campaign in central and southern Africa by the World Health Organization in 1977. A year later ads appeared in major US newspapers soliciting “promiscuous gay male volunteers” to take part in a Hepatitis B vaccine study. [1]</p>
<p><b>The program targeted male homosexuals age 20-40 in New York City</b>, Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco. It was administered by the US Centers for Disease Control which, under its earlier incarnation as the US Public Health Department in Atlanta, oversaw the Tuskegee syphilis experiments on African American males. [2]</p>
<p>San Francisco has been a target of numerous CIA experiments, due to its high population of left-leaning and gay citizens, which the Illuminati views as “undesirables”. According to Dr. Eva Snead, San Francisco has one of the highest cancer rates in the country. For years, malathion – first developed by the Nazis – was sprayed over the city by helicopters from the CIA’s Evergreen Air, whose Arizona base is used, according to author William Cooper, as CIA transshipment point for Columbian cocaine. The mysterious Legionnaire’s Disease occurs often in San Francisco and the CIA’s MK-ULTRA mind control bad acid program was based there.</p>
<p><b>The intellectual force behind the introduction of AIDS</b> was the Bilderberger Group, which became fixated on population control after WWII. Author Cooper says the Policy Committee of the Bilderbergers gave orders to DOD to introduce the AIDS virus. The Bilderbergers are close to the Club of Rome, which was founded on a Rockefeller estate near Bellagio, Italy and is backed by the same European Black Nobility who frequent Bilderberger meetings. A 1968 study by the Club of Rome advocated lowering the birth rate and increasing the death rate. Club founder Dr. Aurelio Peccei made a top-secret recommendation to introduce a microbe that would attack the auto-immune system, then develop a vaccine as a prophylactic for the global elite. [3]</p>
<p>One month after the 1968 Club of Rome meeting Paul Ehrlich published <i>The Population Bomb</i>. The book hints at a draconian depopulation plan in the works. On page seventeen Ehrlich writes, “The problem could have been avoided by population control…so that a ‘death rate solution’ did not have to occur.” A year later MK-NAOMI was born. Peccei himself authored the Club of Rome’s much-touted <i>Global 2000</i> report, which President Jimmy Carter pushed on his BCCI shakedown cruise of Africa. Peccei wrote in the report, “Man is now vested with unprecedented, tremendous responsibilities and thrown into the role of moderator of life on the planet- including his own”.</p>
<p>The Bilderbergers were behind the Haig-Kissinger Depopulation Policy, a driving force at the State Department and administered by the National Security Council. Pressure is applied to Third World countries to reduce their populations. Those that do not comply see their US aid withheld or are subject to Pink Plan low-intensity war that targets civilians, especially women of child-bearing age. In Africa famine and brush-fire wars are encouraged. AK-47 rifles can be bought at West African markets for under $50. The same is true in the markets of Peshawar, Pakistan. In 1975, a year after attending a Club of Rome conference on the topic, Secretary of State Kissinger founded the Office of Population Affairs (OPA).</p>
<blockquote><p>DOD officials testified before Congress that they planned to produce, “a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could be acquired… Most important is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Latin American OPA case officer Thomas Ferguson spilled the beans on OPA’s agenda when he stated, “There is a single theme behind all our work; we must reduce population levels. Either they do it our way, through nice clean methods or they will get the kind of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran, or in Beirut…Once population is out of control it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it…The professionals aren’t interested in reducing population for humanitarian reasons…Civil wars are somewhat drawn-out ways to reduce population. The quickest way to reduce population is through famine like in Africa. We go into a country and say, here is your goddamn development plan. Throw it out the window. Start looking at your population…if you don’t …then you’ll have an El Salvador or an Iran, or worse, a Cambodia”. [4]</p>
<p><b>Ferguson said of El Salvador, “To accomplish what the State Department </b>deems adequate population control, the civil war (run by CIA) would have to be greatly expanded. You have to pull all the males into fighting and kill significant numbers of fertile, child-bearing age females. You are killing a small number of males and not enough fertile females to do the job…If the war went on 30-40 years, you might accomplish something. Unfortunately, we don’t have too many instances of this to study”.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Report from Iron Mountain</b></span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.redicecreations.com/ul_img/25672pyramidstone.jpg" align="left" /><b>In 1961 Kennedy Administration officials McGeorge Bundy</b>, Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk, all CFR and Bilderberger members, led a study group which looked into “the problem of peace”. The group met at Iron Mountain, a huge underground corporate nuclear shelter near Hudson, New York, where CFR think tank The Hudson Institute is located. The bunker contains redundant offices in case of nuclear attack for Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and JP Morgan Chase. [5] A copy of the group discussions, known as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=iron%20mountain%20secret%20government&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Report_from_Iron_Mountain&amp;ei=5kq_UfCKFfKgyAH1sIFw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh7GQLQc2tW_eLgekLqZScSUyBEg" target="_blank">Report from Iron Mountain</a>, was leaked by a participant and published in 1967 by Dial Press.</p>
<p>The report’s authors saw war as necessary and desirable stating “War itself is the basic social system, within which other secondary modes of social organization conflict or conspire. (War is) the principal organizing force…the essential economic stabilizer of modern societies.” The group worried that through “ambiguous leadership” the “ruling administrative class” might lose its ability to “rationalize a desired war”, leading to the “actual disestablishment of military institutions”.</p>
<p><b>The report goes on to say, “…the war system cannot responsibly</b> be allowed to disappear until…we know exactly what we plan to put in its place…The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power…The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in its war powers. War has served as the last great safeguard against the elimination of necessary classes.”</p>
<p>Historian Howard Zinn described this conundrum when he wrote, “American capitalism needed international rivalry- and periodic war- to create an artificial community of interest between rich and poor, supplanting the genuine community of interest among the poor that showed itself in sporadic movements”.</p>
<p><b>The Iron Mountain gang was not the first to discover the virtues of war.</b> In 1909 the trustees of the Andrew Carnegie Foundation for International Peace met to discuss pre-WWI American life. Many of the participants were members of Skull &amp; Bones. They concluded, “There are no known means more efficient than war, assuming the objective is altering the life of an entire people…How do we involve the United States in a war?”</p>
<p>The <em>Report from Iron Mountain</em> goes on to propose a proper role for those of the lower classes, crediting military institutions with providing “antisocial elements with an acceptable role in the social structure.  The younger and more dangerous of these hostile social groupings have been kept under control by the Selective Service System…A possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of society is the reintroduction, in some form consistent with modern technology and political process, of slavery…The development of a sophisticated form of slavery may be an absolute prerequisite for social control in a world at peace.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“…the war system cannot responsibly be allowed to disappear until… we know exactly what we plan to put in its place… The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power… The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in its war powers. War has served as the last great safeguard against the elimination of necessary classes.”  </em><em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=iron%20mountain%20secret%20government&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Report_from_Iron_Mountain&amp;ei=5kq_UfCKFfKgyAH1sIFw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEh7GQLQc2tW_eLgekLqZScSUyBEg" target="_blank">Report from Iron Mountain</a></em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Iron Mountain goons, though thrilled by the idea of slavery, listed</strong> as other socioeconomic substitutions for war: a comprehensive social welfare program, a giant open-ended space program aimed at unreachable targets, a permanent arms inspection regime, an omnipresent global police and peacekeeping force, massive global environmental pollution which would require a large labor pool to clean up, socially-oriented blood sports and a comprehensive eugenics program. [6]</p>
<p>The Iraqi genocide fulfilled the dreams of the Club of Rome Zero Population Growth maniacs, while also providing a testing ground for two of the war substitutes proposed by the Iron Mountain fascists: an arms inspection regime and UN peacekeepers.  Both concepts gained traction in the international community thanks to the Gulf War.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Let the Iraqi Genocide Begin</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estimates of Iraqi casualties during the Gulf War are sobering</strong>.  Some organizations like Greenpeace put the death toll at near one million people.  It was a war in which the media was denied access on a scale never before seen, so casualty figures vary greatly.  According to Tony Murphy, a researcher at the International War Crimes Tribunal, the US attack on Iraq killed 125,000 civilians, while destroying 676 schools, 38 hospitals, 8 major hydroelectric dams, 11 power plants, 119 power substations and half the country’s telephone lines.  The attacks occurred mostly at night when people were most vulnerable.</p>
<p>In the months following the war the death rate of Iraqi children under five tripled.  Thirty-eight percent of these deaths were caused by diarrhea. [7]  Victor Filatov, a Russian journalist reporting for <em>Sovetskaya Rossiya</em> from post-war Baghdad wrote, “What further bloodshed do these barbarians of the 20th century need?  I thought the Americans had changed since Vietnam…but no, they never change.  They remain true to themselves.”</p>
<p><strong>According to former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the US was found guilty</strong> of nineteen war crimes against Iraq before the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=international%20war%20crimes%20tribunal&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FInternational_Criminal_Court&amp;ei=v1q_Uf6xBKqQyQGgsIBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrcA416NJD3FzUxz-76qj-liCvtg&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.aWc" target="_blank">International War Crimes Tribunal</a>.  The US dropped 88,000 tons of bombs on Iraq during the Gulf War and has rained down countless more bombs since.  Many bombs were tipped with armor piercing depleted uranium (DU) warheads, which may account for chronic Iraqi health problems.  Dr. Siegwart-Horst Gunther, a German physician who came to Iraq to help its people, became gravely ill when he handled just one cigar-sized fragment from a DU warhead.  Dr. Gunther measured the tiny object’s radioactivity to be 11 microSv per hour, whereas an acceptable exposure is no more than 300 microSv per year. [8]  Three hundred tons of DU ammunition was deployed during the war.</p>
<p>Many believe DU is responsible for Gulf War Syndrome, which has killed and permanently injured many US soldiers who fought in the Persian Gulf theater.  Since 2000, nearly 11,000 US Gulf War veterans have died from Gulf War Syndrome, while the Pentagon continues to cover up this travesty.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Satanism &amp; Psychotronic Warfare</strong></p>
<p><strong>The US also tested numerous top-secret high-tech weapons</strong> <strong>systems</strong> in the Gulf theatre, while utilizing some old low-frequency favorites.  When Iraqi ground forces surrendered, many of them were in a state of delirium and lethargy that could have been induced by extremely low-frequency radio waves, which the US used as a weapon as early as the Vietnam conflict.</p>
<p>Yale University and CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jose Delgado studied mind control for the Company <img alt="" src="http://loveforlife.com.au/files/2neumy3.jpg" width="268" height="201" data-lazy-type="image" data-lazy-src="http://loveforlife.com.au/files/2neumy3.jpg" />during the 1950’s as part of the MK-ULTRA program.  Delgado determined, “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even possible to create and follow intentions…By electronic stimulation of specific cerebral structures, movements can be induced by radio command…by remote control.”</p>
<p><strong>According to a military document written by Colonel Paul Valley</strong> and Major Michael Aquino titled <em>From PSYOP to Mindwar: The Psychology of Victory</em>, the US Army used an operational weapons system “to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with US national interests”.  The technique was used to secure the surrender of 29,276 armed Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army soldiers in 1967 and 1968.  The US Navy was also heavily involved in “psychotronic” research. [9]  Many US soldiers who served near the DMZ that divided North and South Vietnam claimed to see UFOs on a regular basis.  <em>The Pentagon Papers</em> revealed that an electronic barrier was placed along the DMZ by the secretive <a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=1142" target="_blank">JASON Society</a>.</p>
<p>Major Michael Aquino was an Army psyops specialist in Vietnam, where his unit specialized in drug-inducement, brainwashing, virus injection, brain implants, hypnosis, and use of electromagnetic fields and extremely low-frequency radio waves.  After Vietnam, Aquino moved to San Francisco and founded the Temple of Set.  Set is the ancient Egyptian name for Lucifer.  Aquino was now a senior US Military Intelligence official. [10]  He’d been given a Top Secret security clearance on June, 9, 1981.  Less than a month later an Army intelligence memo revealed that Aquino’s Temple of Set was an off-shoot of Anton La Vey’s Church of Satan, also headquartered in San Francisco. Two other Set members were Willie Browning and Dennis Mann.  Both were Army Intelligence officers.</p>
<p><strong>The Temple of Set was obsessed with military matters and political fascism</strong>.  It was especially preoccupied with the Nazi Order of the Trapezoid.  Aquino’s “official” job was history professor at Golden Gate College.  The Temple recruited the same Hells Angels who Billy Mellon Hitchcock had used to dole out his bad CIA acid.  Its members frequented prostitutes where they engaged in all manner of sadomasochistic activities. [11]  Director of Army Counter-Intelligence Donald Press revealed that Dennis Mann was assigned to the 306 PSYOPS Battalion and that Aquino was assigned to a top secret program known as Presidio.</p>
<p>Presidio is also the name of a spooky complex in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which Mikhail Gorbachev reportedly frequented as the Soviet Union was falling apart.  Was Aquino part of an operation to “map the mind” of the Soviet Union’s last leader and induce him into proposing both <em>glasnost</em> and <em>perestroika</em>, the two free market policies that ultimately led to the Soviet Union’s demise?  Remember the curious mark which suddenly appeared on Gorbachev’s forehead?  Was he implanted with some sort of microchip mind-control device to make him think “in accordance with US national interests”?</p>
<p><strong>Such Orwellian technology is marketed on a regular basis throughout the world</strong>.  International Healthline Corporation and others sell microchip implants in the US, Russia and Europe.  The Humane Society has adopted a policy of micro-chipping all stray pets. The State of Hawaii <em>requires</em> that all pets be micro-chipped.  Six thousand people in Sweden have accepted a microchip in their hand, which they use for all purchases. Trials are also underway in Japan.  In July 2002, National Public Radio reported a similar trial beginning in Seattle.  Later in 2002, after a rash of suspicious abductions of young girls, BBC reported that a British company plans to implant children with microchips so that their parents can monitor their whereabouts.</p>
<p>Dr. Carl Sanders, a highly acclaimed electronics engineer, revealed that a microchip project he launched to help people with severed spinal cords was taken over by Bill Colby’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=bill%20colby%20%2B%20operation%20phoenix%20&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhoenix_Program&amp;ei=OFu_UefeCKqgyAG6goGYCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0OWTTqoG1_WcdtidXIwaGL9YXNQ&amp;bvm=bv.47883778,d.aWc" target="_blank">Operation Phoenix </a>in a series of meetings organized by Henry Kissinger.  Sanders says the optimal spot for a microchip implant is just below the hairline on a person’s forehead, since the device can be recharged by changes in body temperatures, which are most pronounced there.  Interestingly, this is the location of the pineal gland or Third Eye.</p>
<p><strong>The 1986 Emigration Control Act grants the President the power to mandate</strong> any kind of ID he deems necessary. [12]  Researchers at Southern California have developed a chip which mimics the hippocampus, the part of the brain that deals with memory.  Pentagon officials are interested in using it in experiments to create a “super-soldier”. [13]  Another microchip called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrainGate" target="_blank">Brain Gate</a> is being implanted in paralyzed people.  It allows them to control their environment by simply thinking. [14]</p>
<p>In Iraq, psychological warfare gave way to slow genocide.  According to UNICEF, as of late 2001, 1.5 million Iraqi children had died as a result of sanctions, while one child in ten died before their first birthday.  Thalassemia, anemia and diarrhea were the biggest killers and could have been prevented were it not for a chronic shortage of blood and medicine in Iraq due to the sanctions.  UN Committee 661 served as arbiter of what constituted a “dual use” item and therefore banned for import into Iraq.  As of 2001, over 1,600 Iraqi contracts with Western companies for medical equipment had been blocked by 661. [15]</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Yale University and CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jose Delgado studied mind control for the Company during the 1950’s as part of the MK-ULTRA program.  Delgado determined, “Physical control of many brain functions is a demonstrated fact…it is even possible to create and follow intentions…By electronic stimulation of specific cerebral structures, movements can be induced by radio command…by remote control.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Gulf War decimated Iraq’s sewer and water treatment systems</strong>.  Iraqis were forced to drink polluted water, leading to numerous health problems.  Iraq was not allowed to import chlorine to clean the water since 661 deemed it a potential chemical weapon.  Electrical power was rationed in three-hour daily increments per household since the Iraqi government couldn’t get the parts it needed to fix its power plants after the US bombed its entire power grid.  With the devaluation of the Iraqi <em>dinar</em> and the ban on the export of 2.4 million barrels of oil per day, the average Iraqi lived on $2.50 a month- enough to buy a pair of shoes.  The only Iraqis not affected were the wealthy elite, who had long ago stashed their savings overseas in US dollars.</p>
<p>UNICEF estimates that 28% of Iraqi children no longer went to school.  Before the war almost all children attended.  Often families could only afford to send one child to school because of the cost of simple things like backpacks, shoes and notebooks.  Rafah Salam Aziz, Director of Mansour Children’s Hospital, said parents were often forced to make similar decisions about their children’s lives.  Aziz said, “Many times it’s easier for a family to let a baby die rather than let the whole family go hungry and get sick.”[16]</p>
<p><strong>In 1996 Clinton Defense Secretary William Perry announced a new military buildup</strong> in the Persian Gulf.  Soon cruise missiles were again raining down on Baghdad.  Many nations now grew weary of both US bombing and the sanctions regime, which was brutalizing the Iraqi people while strengthening the grip of Saddam Hussein.  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose country signed a deal with Iraq to rebuild its shattered oil sector, said he was disturbed at the use of “extreme and radical force against the Arab world”.  The Russian opposition offered a more scalding appraisal.  Alexander Lebed stating angrily, “The US is like a strong master who spits on everybody.”[17]</p>
<p>Turkey, Jordan and Syria all expressed unease over the new round of bombing.  Even the Saudis, where Islamic fundamentalism was on the rise and two major bombings had occurred at US bases, now refused to allow the US to use its bases to bomb Iraq.  Many countries, including France, began openly flaunting the UN embargo against Iraq in the late 1990’s.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Halliday, former Assistant Secretary of the UN </strong>who initially headed the UN Humanitarian Program to Iraq, resigned his post in protest. He said sanctions were demolishing the very class of Iraqi people who wanted to create a better government in the country.  He was scornful of the UN Oil for Food Program under which the US received 70% of Iraqi oil.  Halliday stated plainly, “We are guilty of committing genocide, through the Security Council, against Iraq.”[18]</p>
<p>Halliday’s 1998 successor was Hans Van Sponeck, who watched as the UN unfurled the UNSCOM arms inspection regime, paid for by Iraqi oil sales.  US inspector Scott Ritter confirmed Iraqi suspicions that UNSCOM was gathering intelligence for CIA and Mossad.  UNSCOM was just the latest CIA tool.  In 1996 the Iraqi government claimed international relief agencies, including the World Food Program, which claimed to be helping the Kurds, were actually CIA operatives attempting to destabilize the country.</p>
<p><strong>In fact the CIA had spent more than $20 million in its support of the Iraqi National Congress</strong>, led by long-time CIA surrogate Jalal Talibani’s PKK Kurdish faction. [19]  In January 1997 Iraq uncovered two Mossad spy rings in one month following the attempted assassination of Saddam Hussein’s son. [20]  Hans Van Sponeck had seen enough. He too resigned in protest.</p>
<p>In early 1999 it was revealed that the US had used UNSCOM to plant electronic bugging devices in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  Arms inspector Scott Ritter said the CIA was using UNSCOM to “provoke a crisis”.  In December 1998 UNSCOM, faced with the embarrassing accusations of espionage, pulled out of Iraq.  On December 15th the US launched a new round of bombing.  Ritter says intelligence gathered by UNSCOM was used for targeting. UNSCOM spokesman David Kay resurfaced in 2003 calling for a US invasion of Iraq. He now worked for SAIC, which landed numerous Pentagon contracts to rebuild Iraq.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/israelnsa3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/israelnsa2.jpg" align="left" /></a>It doesn&#8217;t surprise. On June 8, Haaretz headlined &#8220;What was the Israeli involvement in collecting US communications intel for NSA?&#8221; More on that below.</p>
<p>On April 3, 2012, James Bamford headlined &#8220;Shady Companies with Ties to Israel Wiretap for US for the NSA.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said NSA chief General Keith Alexander&#8217;s &#8220;having a busy year.&#8221; He&#8217;s &#8220;cutting ribbons at secret bases and bringing to life the agency&#8217;s greatly expanded eavesdropping network.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In January he dedicated the new $358 million CAPT Joseph J. Rochefort Building at NSA Hawaii, and in March he unveiled the 604,000-square-foot John Whitelaw Building at NSA Georgia.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for around &#8220;4,000 earphone-clad intercept operators, analysts and other specialists, many of them employed by private contractors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spies &#8220;R&#8221; Us defines US policy. NSA&#8217;s &#8220;mammoth 1-million-square-foot, $2 billion Utah Data Center is far more sweeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s located at Camp Williams. It&#8217;s a Utah National Guard training facility. Once fully operational, says Bamford, it&#8217;ll &#8220;become, in effect, the NSA Cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll receive data from NSA satellites, overseas listening posts, and nationwide multipleNo telecom facility monitoring rooms. What&#8217;s planned is an unprecedented global spy network.</p>
<p>NSA operatives and hackers will harvest around 2.1 million gigabytes of data per hour. It&#8217;ll do so on the world&#8217;s most powerful computer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s call Titan Supercomputer. It can handle over 20,000 trillion calculations per second or 20 petaflops. One petaflop = one quadrillion instructions per second.</p>
<p>Supercomputer power will be used to collect and analyze foreign and domestic communications from all possible sources.</p>
<p>Two Israeli companies are involved. High-tech firms Verint and Narus have longstanding US/Israeli intelligence connections. For many years, Verint was a majority-owned Comverse Technology subsidiary.</p>
<p>Both companies have about half their employees in Israel. In August 2012, Verint acquired Comverse. It now operates independently.</p>
<p>It makes security software. It calls itself &#8220;a global leader in Actionable Intelligence solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Narus calls itself a cybersecurity company. It&#8217;s an independent Boeing subsidiary. It provides real-time network traffic and analytics software. It does so with enterprise class spyware capabilities.</p>
<p>In 1997, it was founded in Israel. It created NarusInsight. It&#8217;s a supercomputer system. A previous article said AT&amp;T uses it at their secret San Francisco facility. It lets NSA spy on its customers.</p>
<p>Verint&#8217;s software also is used to do it. Bamford called it &#8220;especially troubling that both companies have had extensive ties to Israel, as well as links to (its) intelligence service.&#8221;</p>
<p>A previous article discussed Israeli spying on America. The CIA calls Israel America&#8217;s main regional spy threat. An Israeli-based CIA operative once found food in his refrigerator rearranged.</p>
<p>Washington knows what&#8217;s going on. Publicly it&#8217;s ignored. Pre-9/11, the FBI uncovered a massive US-based Israeli spy ring. It remains active.</p>
<p>It betrays America. Numerous Israeli citizens are involved. They have close ties to foreign military, criminal and intelligence sources. They reportedly breach US laws with impunity.</p>
<p>Israel&#8217;s featured prominently in annual FBI reports. It actively seeks proprietary/secret US information. It&#8217;s mainly on military systems and advanced computer applications.</p>
<p>Proprietary commercial and industrial data are stolen. Israel recruits spies. Sophisticated methods are used. Computers are hacked for information.</p>
<p>Washington&#8217;s Government Accountability Office (GAO) said Israel &#8220;conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the United States of any US ally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pentagon accused Israel of &#8220;actively engag(ing) in military and industrial espionage in the United States. An Israeli citizen working in the US who has access to proprietary information is likely to be a target of such espionage.&#8221;</p>
<p>FBI whistleblower John Cole said Justice Department officials ordered dozens of Israeli espionage cases dropped. At issue was political pressure.</p>
<p>Washington gives Israel billions of dollars in annual aid, state-of-the-art weapons and technology, and numerous other special privileges. In return, it steals US state and commercial secrets.</p>
<p>Despite longstanding close ties, Washington considers Israel both ally and counterintelligence threat. In terms of technical capability and human resources, it matches America&#8217;s best.</p>
<p>It has access to the highest US political, military and intelligence sources. Bamford said NSA-developed advanced analytical/data-mining software was lawlessly given Israel.</p>
<p>An Operations Directorate technical director did so secretly. Apparently Israeli companies got access. Technology they got advanced their own.</p>
<p>Narus once boasted about being &#8220;known for its ability to capture and collect data from the largest networks around the world.&#8221; Unexplained was that stolen software facilitates is capabilities.</p>
<p>Retired Israeli General Hanan Gefen ran its secret Unit 8200. It&#8217;s Israel&#8217;s NSA equivalent. He admitted Israeli ties to Comverse.</p>
<p>At the time, it owned Verint. It owns other Israeli high-tech companies. They specialize in eavesdropping and surveillance. They operate globally.</p>
<p>According to Gefen, the &#8220;correlation between serving in the intelligence Unit 8200 and starting successful high-tech companies is not coincidental.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the technologies in use around the world and developed in Israel were originally military technologies and were developed and improved by Unit veterans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kobi Alexander founded Verint. He formerly served as chairman. He&#8217;s a fugitive. FBI accusations include fraud, theft, lying, bribery, money laundering and related crimes.</p>
<p>Two of his top Comverse associates were indicted on similar charges. Both were imprisoned. They paid millions of dollars in fines and penalties.</p>
<p>NSA claims it takes malfeasance and other legitimate complaints seriously. Spying technology and expertise take precedence.</p>
<p>Bamford says take NSA assurances cautiously. &#8220;Who&#8217;s listening to the listeners,&#8221; he asks?</p>
<p>Haaretz asked if Verint and Narus &#8220;collected information from the US communications network&#8221; for NSA?</p>
<p>Neither company responded when asked. Former senior NSA official-turned whistleblower Thomas Drake exposed fraud, waste, abuse and other lawless agency practices.</p>
<p>They relate to warrantless data-mining practices. In April 2010, he was indicted under the Espionage Act. Charges included &#8220;willful retention of classified information, obstruction of justice, and making false statements.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a May 22, 2011 60 Minutes broadcast, all charges were dropped. In return, Drake pled guilty to a minor misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one year probation and community service. He lost his high-paying NSA job and pension.</p>
<p>On March 15, 2013, he spoke at the National Press Club. He focused on First Amendment rights. In part he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The threats to the First Amendment by the government is bull&#8217;s eye-centered on a free unfettered press designed to suppress and repress speech and political expression in America, create fear through privilege and unilateral authority over what is fit or unfit for the First Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If speech becomes the instrument of crime when revealing government crime and wrongdoing, we are under arbitrary authoritarian rule and not the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make an argument that government increasingly prefers to operate in the shadows and finds the First Amendment a constraint on its activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, taking off the veil of government secrecy has more often than not turned truth-tellers and whistleblowers into turncoats and traitors, who are then often criminally burned and blacklisted and broken by the government on the stake of national security.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew too much truth and exposed government illegalities, fraud and abuse and was turned into a criminal for doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was charged under the Espionage Act, faced many years in prison and became an enemy of the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was five years of living under the boot of the Surveillance State, and yet I was saved by the First Amendment and the court of public opinion and the free press, including the strength and growing resiliency of the alternative media.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we really want the government listening in on and tracking the lives of so many others? Have our constitutional freedoms become the latest victims of 9/11?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will national security replace our individual rights? Will fear take priority over freedom? Will government censorship and propaganda triumph over personal choice and disclosure, use suppression repression?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we starve liberty for the increasingly myopic sake of security, what will we have left to defend?&#8221;</p>
<p>If truth-telling is criminalized, freedom no longer exists.</p>
<p>Drake corroborated information AT&amp;T whistleblower Mark Klein and others reported. Spies &#8220;R&#8221; Us reflects US policy.</p>
<p>Drake verified NSA&#8217;s use of Narus techology. Britain&#8217;s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collects intelligence from major US Internet companies. They do it via Prism electronic surveillance.</p>
<p>Officially it&#8217;s called US-984XN. It&#8217;s used for sweeping domestic and foreign spying. It&#8217;s the main source for raw NSA intelligence. It&#8217;s top secret for good reason. Now it&#8217;s existence is publicly known.</p>
<p>Mossad&#8217;s longstanding ties to Verint, Narus, and other Israeli surveillance technology companies assures it access to information they collect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true wherever these companies operate. America has 16 active intelligence agencies. They operate the same way. Warrantless dragnet spying is lawless.</p>
<p>Freedom pays the greatest price. It&#8217;s disappearing in plain sight. It&#8217;s heading for the dustbin of history without legitimate resistance enough to stop it. Nothing less has a chance.</p>

				<p>June 9, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17783#respond" title="Comment on Genetic Weapons &#8212; Can Your DNA Kill You?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="17783 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=17783">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/dnapeople3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/dnapeople2.jpg" align="left" /></a>It is  a scene out of a futuristic political  thriller—the Secretary of State issues secret orders for embassy officials to collect the DNA of foreign heads of state while the President, speaking at a $1000 a plate dinner, is surrounded by a contingent of Secret Service agents wiping clean his drinking glasses and picking up stray hair follicles. They are not just protecting the President—they are protecting the President&#8217;s DNA.</p>
<p>If this sounds like a script treatment for a Hollywood version of a Philip K. Dick novel, consider this: The Secretary of State&#8217;s name is Hillary Clinton and her directives to embassies were uncovered in a 2010 Wikileaks cable release.  The President in this scenario is Barack Obama and the Secret Service unit pledged to protect his DNA is a group of Navy stewards, as revealed in the 2009 book by Ronald Kessler, entitled “In the President&#8217;s Secret Service.”</p>
<p>Our government&#8217;s DNA obsession was again in the news this week as the Supreme Court handed down a decision, worthy of penning by George Orwell, that law enforcement collection of arrestees&#8217; DNA  is not an invasion of privacy. The decision likened DNA to fingerprints, neatly sidestepping the fact that a person&#8217;s complete genetic makeup is contained in those drops of blood that the police can now collect with impunity and without fear of a civil rights lawsuit.</p>
<p>Beyond the obvious surface concerns that this decision violates both the Fourth Amendment and the subsequent exclusionary rule (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_rule" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<wbr></wbr>Exclusionary_rule</a>), there are further, deeper concerns as to why our government is so keen on collecting our DNA. The stated aim of furthering   crime solution becomes tinny when one realizes that the government is also collecting the DNA of newborns. President Bush signed   The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007, which formally   codified the process that the federal government has been engaged in for years, screening the DNA of all newborn babies in the U.S.</p>
<p>Since we are not yet threatened with the spectre of toddlers robbing banks or committing rape, one must look further to discern what is the big deal about our DNA.</p>
<p>Back in 1997, Dr. Wayne Nathanson warned  a meeting of the  Science and Ethics Department of the Medical Society of the United Kingdom that “gene therapy” might be turned to insidious uses and result in “gene weapons,” which could be used to target specific people containing a specific genetic structure.  These weapons, Nathanson warned, “could be delivered not only in the forms already seen in warfare such as gas and aerosol, but could also be added to water supplies, causing not only death but sterility and birth defects in targeted groups.” <a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/16-human-genome-project-opens-the-door-to-ethnically-specific-bioweapons/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">/www.projectcensored.org/top-<wbr></wbr>stories/articles/16-human-<wbr></wbr>genome-project-opens-the-door-<wbr></wbr>to-ethnically-specific-<wbr></wbr>bioweapons/</a></p>
<p>Decades before Dr. Nathanson&#8217;s highly publicized warning, the U.S. Government was already hard at work in scientific endeavors to find gene and ethnic specific weapons. In an article entitled &#8220;Ethnic Weapons,&#8221; published in the Military Review in 1970, the author, Dr. Carl A. Larson, was found rhapsodizing about the state of technology facilitating the targeting of ethnic groups with covert weapons. Wrote Larson: “Surrounded with clouds of secrecy, a systematic search for new incapacitating agents is going on in many laboratories. The general idea, as discussed in open literature, was originally that of minimum destruction.”</p>
<p>However, his tone soon changes and he writes, somewhat chillingly, that “It is quite possible to use incapacitating agents over the entire range of offensive operations, from covert activities to mass destruction.”</p>
<p>Larson concludes with the following stark declaration: “The enzymatic process for RNA production has been known for some years but now the factors have been revealed which regulate the initiation and specificity of enzyme production. Not only have the factors been found, but their inhibitors. <b>Thus, the functions of life lie bare to attack.” (emphasis added)</b></p>
<p>Dr. Wouter Basson’s research for Project Coast, the biological and chemical warfare unit under the apartheid government in South Africa, was known to be focused on developing a &#8220;blacks only&#8221; bioweapon.  Basson, who was tied to intelligence facilities and labs in both Great Britain and the U.S., has been reported to have been successful in his endeavors, which were taking place back in the seventies.  According to sources close to Basson, his research entailed locating substances which would attach onto melanin. Melanin is present in high degrees in darker colored skin.</p>
<p>Since Basson&#8217;s work on the melanin project, the rates of hypertension and diabetes have skyrocketed in people of color—specifically those of African descent and also indigenous, brown skinned populations. In some communities, the incidence of these diseases is now reported as up to 50%. Consonant with the reports that this disease- producing melanin- related substance has been leaked into processed food, one finds the spiking rates of the &#8220;silent killers,&#8221;  hypertension and diabetes, to be present in the developed world, where people eat more processed food. In rural Africa, for example, where the population eats food from natural sources, the rates of diabetes and hypertension have remained constant over the years.</p>
<p>The mapping of the human genome satisfied all the requisites for creating gene specific weapons. Geneticists have maintained that developing an ethnic weapon is actually far more difficult than creating a gene weapon to target a specific person.  The differences between groups are apparently much smaller than the differences between individuals and therefore the creation of a genetic weapon to target, for example, a head of state or a President is far less challenging than creating such a weapon to target an entire race.</p>
<p>The FBI admits to a database of around 13 million offenders, many only arrested and never charged with a crime. According to Twila Brase, President of Citizens Council for Health Freedom, around 4 million samples (filed with the babies&#8217; names) are collected each year by State Health Departments. Some states, such as Minnesota, have been collecting newborn DNA samples since the mid-eighties. Minnesota alone is reported to have a newborn database of over 1.5 million samples.</p>
<p>The delivery systems for a DNA weapon would be easy: Everything.</p>
<p>Because the weaponized genetic material would only affect the target, the weapon could be leaked into the food supply, the water supply or sprayed in an airborne delivery system, such as the inexplicable chemtrails that are now blanketing our skies. And should a low profile target suddenly die, who would ever know that he died of a gene based weapon? Should the target be high profile, like perhaps a Hugo Chavez or Canada&#8217;s Jack Layton, who would be able to trace a deadly disease back to a weapon targeting his DNA?</p>
<p>The insistence of the U.S. Government that it is only trying to protect its citizens from a terrorist threat is the perfect cover of plausible deniability. Under the mantle of &#8220;protection,&#8221; our rights have been systematically stripped away while wars abroad have been launched against the Semitic peoples of the Middle East.  Genetic based weapons are another tool in the plausible deniability eugenics tool box. They may, in fact, be one of the most salient tools.</p>
<p>Years before Nathanson&#8217;s warning was issued, our government had already attained a significant level of ability to weaponize against ethnic groups. An article entitled Ethnic Weapons, published in the Military Review in 1970, found the author, Dr. Carl A Larson rhapsodizing about the scientific accomplishments enabling the creation and deployment of ethnic weapons. Wrote Larson: “Surrounded with clouds of secrecy, a systematic search for new incapacitating agents is going on in many laboratories. The general idea, as discussed in open literature, was originally that of minimum destruction.” However, his tone soon changes and he writes, somewhat chillingly that “It is quite possible to use incapacitating agents over the entire range of offensive operations, from covert activities to mass destruction.”</p>

<p>Knowing the accuracy of historical reality is difficult, but accepting the truth in that chronicle is almost impossible for most people to accept. This reluctance to deal with the stark and calculated obliteration of societal freedom is the ultimate curse of the human condition. The denial of the authoritarian plan by elites like the Bilderberg cabal is the equivalent of Satan&#8217;s greatest lie, convincing us he does not exist. Well, the days of casting the smear of conspiracy over any reporting on the secret and hidden conclave of global manipulators, is officially over.</p>
<blockquote><p>At this year&#8217;s Bilderberg conference, for the first time, there will be a <a href="http://bilderberg2013.co.uk/uncategorized/press-office-and-reception-zone/">Press Office</a> - hosted by the Bilderberg Welcoming Committee &#8211; located on the hotel grounds. The aim of the Press Office will be to facilitate the mainstream and alternative media in their coverage of the meeting.There will be liaison officers from the Hertfordshire Constabulary present in the Reception Zone for the duration of the conference.</p>
<p>This is the first officially sanctioned Press Office for the Bilderberg conference, and is a considerable step forward in the relations between the conference and the press.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the dramatic public reversal of deniability of their existence and the acknowledgement that the newly elected leader of the Swedish social-democratic party, <a href="http://explosivereports.com/2013/05/05/swedish-head-of-social-democrats-first-admitted-bilderberg-2013-participant/">Stefan Löfven</a>, will be the guest of Jacob Wallenberg &#8211; a prominent member of the Bilderberg steering committee, Bilderberg confirmation of the decades of reporting by the late <a href="http://americanfreepress.net/?p=10045">Jim Tucker</a> is vindicated.</p>
<p>Additional background and a comparison of <a href="http://batr.org/view/061211.html">How the media covers Bilderberg meetings</a> and <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/021705.html">Bilderberg Propaganda Rules the Planet</a> is worth a review. For a persuasive critique of the investigations and research of Daniel Estulin into the underlying implication of these gatherings, read the entire summary by Stephen Lendman of &#8220;<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-true-story-of-the-bilderberg-group-and-what-they-may-be-planning-now/13808">The True Story of the Bilderberg Group</a>&#8221; and What They May Be Planning Now.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever its early mission, the Group is now &#8220;a shadow world government….threaten(ing) to take away our right to direct our own destinies (by creating) a disturbing reality&#8221; very much harming the public’s welfare. In short, Bilderbergers want to supplant individual nation-state sovereignty with an all-powerful global government, corporate controlled, and check-mated by militarized enforcement.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even more significant is the account of the age-old struggle for global control that can be traced to the <a href="http://explosivereports.com/2012/05/28/ancient-roots-of-bilderberg-reveal-prusso-teutonic-agenda-for-world-domination/">Ancient Roots of Bilderberg Reveal Prusso-Teutonic Agenda for World Domination</a>. Author Jurriaan Maessen provides a provocative analysis.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As Paul Joseph Watson reported in his May 11 2009 article <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/top-nazis-planned-eu-style-fourth-reich.html">Top Nazis Planned EU-Style Fourth Reich</a>, top Nazi industrialists were present at the cradle of the European Union and, through the creation of the Bilderberg group, guided her growth during all stages of development into the post-war era. German industrialists, it seems, have aligned themselves with the Anglo-American establishment after the war, teaming up to form what is better known as the New World Order. As reported in the article, a group of top ranking German industrialists planned for an economic super state founded upon a common market for the whole of Europe. It has also been confirmed that the Bilderberg group had their plans for a European Union and currency in place by at least 1955.The idea of uniting Europe in a closed trade bloc is no longer shocking if Germany assumes domination over such a bloc&#8221;, wrote one of the founding Nazi-ideologues in the 19th century. The man who arranged for Hitler to become Chancellor of Germany, Von Papen, had also written about the possibility of a &#8220;European Federation&#8221; under strict German control of course, with Berlin as its glorious power center.</p>
<p>NATO has provided for the international army, while the European Central Bank does the same for international finance. All these activities have been developed under the careful direction of the Bilderberg Group and subsequently carried out by its designated subdivisions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Authoritarianism is not new to the blue-blood lineage of continental nobility. Millenniums of succeeding empires shared the same ambition &#8211; rule the world.</p>
<p>The next citation provided the linkage that many &#8220;PC&#8221; armchair observers are afraid to deal with.</p>
<p>The David Icke Newsletter argues in the <a href="http://rense.com/general86/zelephant.htm">The Zionist Elephant In The Room</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, Rothschild Illuminati fronts like the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Royal Institute of International Affairs, and others, still answer to the Round Table which string-pulls and coordinates from the shadows. This is why Zionists in government are invariably connected with these Rothschild-controlled organizations.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get this straight. Zionism doesn&#8217;t give a damn about Jewish people. To the Rothschilds and their Zionist gofers and thugs the Jewish people as a whole are merely cattle to be used and abused as necessary &#8211; just like the rest of the human population.</p>
<p>The networks of the House of Rothschild were behind Hitler and the rise of the Nazi Party in the Rothschild heartland of Germany where they had changed their name from Bauer in 18th century Frankfurt and launched the dynasty that was to control global finance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this explanation of the forbidden knowledge that if kept from your scrutiny by the mainstream press, the Bilderberg summits were protected for decades from objective observation of their agenda and strategy for implementing their New World Order absolutism.</p>
<p>The iconoclastic <a href="http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=216">Brother Nathanael</a> - Street Evangelist rants, &#8220;One of the Bilderberg’s deceptions is to invite insignificant leaders in the academic &amp; scientific realms as a &#8220;decoy.&#8221; Here Are The Real Players Attending the 2008 Bilderberg &amp; They Are Jewish Bankers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ben Shalom Bernanke: Chairman of the privately held US Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>James Wolfensohn: International Jewish financier. Chairman of Wolfensohn &amp; Company Investments. A former World Bank President, this Jew has more than 140 employees and offices in London, Tokyo and Moscow. Wolfensohn also has a banking partnership with Fuji Bank of Japan and Jacob Rothschild of Britain.</p>
<p>Robert Zoellick: Chairman of the US World Bank Group a covert subsidiary of the Rothschild run International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Josef Ackermann: Chairman of the Executive Committee of Deutsche Bank AG of Zurich Switzerland. Ackermann is a Rothschild partner in white collar crime.</p>
<p>Kenneth Jacobs: Deputy Chairman Head of Lazard Bank North America. Lazard Bank, a Rothschild associate bank, operates in 39 cities throughout North America, Europe, Australia, Asia, and South America.</p>
<p>David Rockefeller: Owner of Chase Manhattan Bank. Former Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations &amp; Founder of the Trilateral Commission. Though not a Jew, Rockefeller is a Rothschild stooge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the relevant viewpoint is that the Bilderberg assembly is by invitation from the highest echelon of committed agents of globalism. Their decisions become policy and governance turns into a continuous decent into slavery. The manifestation of the Bilderberg coalition is in keeping with the <a href="http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2008/06/rhodes-round-table-groups.html">Round Table</a>, a secret society started around the turn of the 20th century by Freemason and Rothschild agent, Lord Alfred Milner, who was entrusted the mission by Cecil Rhodes.The Anglo-American dominance of international intervention is rooted in Bilderberg discussions organized on the principle of reaching consensus for global hegemony. Pro Zionist financiers impose the objectives of the House of Rothschild upon America and England. The origins of totalitarian assimilation under the banner of the centralized authority oppression stems from the cult of the moneychangers.</p>

<p>Keeping informed on the latest schemes of <a href="http://youtu.be/yfi92FGPM1I">Bilderberg 2013 In The UK with Press For Truth</a> by watching the video is a must view. Also, follow the <a href="http://bilderberg2013livestream.blogspot.co.uk/">Bilderberg 2013 Stream page</a> that has several links covering live feeds from the meetings. Finally, the <a href="http://www.infowars.com/b/">Infowars</a>coverage of Bilderberg with <a href="http://www.infowars.com/bilderberg-cancels-hotel-reservations-of-journalists-covering-secret-meeting/">Alex Jones</a> and <a href="http://www.infowars.com/2_bilderberg-fringe-festival-in-effect-banned-by-watford-council-and-police/">David Icke</a> promises to be groundbreaking.Exhaustive arguments and proofs of the cataclysmic consequences coming out of every Bilderberg session encircle our globe with even incremental policy that fosters the New World Order. The names of the elites vary over time, but the globalist authoritarian culture only grows.</p>
<p>The fact that the exposure of the Bilderberg union is gaining traction gives solace to guardians of the human race. The sect of banksters devotion to the mischievous sprite and the dark side cannot force their tyranny on an awakened public dedicated to the defeat of the Illuminati empire.</p>
<p>The first step is to accept the truth that globalism is the engine of national destruction and a world governance substitute, under the control of an aristocratic bloodline, is the existential nihilist end of civilization. The Amschel Moses Rothschild &#8211; Cecil Rhodes vision of competing world dominance has merged into a technocratic intercellular substance of subjugation and extermination.</p>
<p>The days of allowing a massive media cover-up of the actual intentions of the Bilderberg clan are over. The alternative press has the credibility to speak truth to power. The public has the responsibility to mature emotionally and reject the delusional myths that protect the fabricated privileges of evil elites.</p>
<p>The secrecy of secret societies in a global telecommunication environment is doomed. Only with greater levels of planetary oppression, can the controllers of the Bilderberg fraternity maintain their cruel imperium. It is up to the citizens of the world to neuter this lineage of deranged plutocrats.</p>

<img alt="World Bank Insider Blows Whistle on Corruption, Federal Reserve" src="http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a2e4a9e87512c1db9bdf53c4bfc14071_M.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>A former insider at the World Bank, ex-Senior Counsel Karen Hudes, says the global financial system is dominated by a small group of corrupt, power-hungry figures centered around the privately owned U.S. Federal Reserve. The network has seized control of the media to cover up its crimes, too, she explained. In an interview with<em>The New American</em>, Hudes said that when she tried to blow the whistle on multiple problems at the World Bank, she was fired for her efforts. Now, along with a network of fellow whistleblowers, Hudes is determined to expose and end the corruption. And she is confident of success.</p>
<p>Citing an <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0025995#s3" target="_blank">explosive 2011 Swiss study</a> published in the <em>PLOS ONE</em> journal on the “network of global corporate control,” Hudes pointed out that a small group of entities — mostly financial institutions and especially central banks — exert a massive amount of influence over the international economy from behind the scenes. “What is really going on is that the world’s resources are being dominated by this group,” she explained, adding that the “corrupt power grabbers” have managed to dominate the media as well. “They’re being allowed to do it.”</p>
<p>According to the peer-reviewed paper, which presented the first global investigation of ownership architecture in the international economy, transnational corporations form a “giant bow-tie structure.” A large portion of control, meanwhile, “flows to a small tightly-knit core of financial institutions.” The researchers described the core as an “economic ‘super-entity’” that raises important issues for policymakers and researchers. Of course, the implications are enormous for citizens as well.</p>
<p>Hudes, an attorney who spent some two decades working in the World Bank’s legal department, has observed the machinations of the network up close. “I realized we were now dealing with something known as state capture, which is where the institutions of government are co-opted by the group that’s corrupt,” she told <em>The New American</em> in a phone interview. “The pillars of the U.S. government — some of them — are dysfunctional because of state capture; this is a big story, this is a big cover up.”</p>
<p>At the heart of the network, Hudes said, are 147 financial institutions and central banks — especially the Federal Reserve, which was created by Congress but is <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/4581-fed-manipulations-in-the-crosshairs">owned by essentially a cartel of private banks</a>. “This is a story about how the international financial system was secretly gamed, mostly by central banks — they’re the ones we are talking about,” she explained. “The central bankers have been gaming the system. I would say that this is a power grab.”</p>
<p>The Fed in particular is at the very center of the network and the coverup, Hudes continued, citing a policy and oversight body that includes top government and Fed officials. Central bankers have also been <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/15116-after-gold-crash-experts-point-to-central-bank-manipulation">manipulating gold prices</a>, she added, echoing widespread concerns that <em>The New American</em> has <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/4581-fed-manipulations-in-the-crosshairs">documented extensively</a>. Indeed, even the inaccurate World Bank financial statements that Hudes has been trying to expose are linked to the U.S. central bank, she said.</p>
<p>“The group that we’re talking about from the Zurich study — that’s the Federal Reserve; it has some other pieces to it, but that’s the Federal Reserve,” Hudes explained. “So the Federal Reserve secretly dominated the world economy using secret, interlocking corporate directorates, and terrorizing anybody who managed to figure out that they were having any kind of role, and putting people in very important positions so that they could get a free pass.”</p>
<p>The shadowy but immensely powerful <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/economics/item/4500-basel-iii-and-sound-banking">Bank for International Settlements</a> serves as “the club of these private central bankers,” Hudes continued. “Now, are people going to want <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/4581-fed-manipulations-in-the-crosshairs">interest on their country’s debts to continue to be paid to that group</a> when they find out the secret tricks that that group has been doing? Don’t forget how they’ve enriched themselves extraordinarily and how they’ve taken taxpayer money for the bailout.”</p>
<p>As far as intervening in the gold price, Hudes said it was an effort by the powerful network and its central banks to “hold onto its paper currency” — a suspicion <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/15116-after-gold-crash-experts-point-to-central-bank-manipulation">shared by many analysts and even senior government officials</a>. The World Bank whistleblower also said that contrary to official claims, she did not believe there was any gold being held in Fort Knox. Even congressmen and foreign governments have<a href="http://www.thenewamericanmedia.com/is-gold-in-fort-knox-real-ron-paul-wants-to-know/"> tried to find out if the precious metals were still there</a>, but they met with little success. Hudes, however, believes the scam will eventually come undone.</p>
<p>“This is like crooks trying to figure out where they can go hide. It’s a mafia,” she said. “These culprits that have grabbed all this economic power have succeeded in infiltrating both sides of the issue, so you will find people who are supposedly trying to fight corruption who are just there to spread disinformation and as a placeholder to trip up anybody who manages to get their act together.… Those thugs think that if they can keep the world ignorant, they can bleed it longer.”</p>
<p>Of course, the major corruption at the highest levels of government and business is not a new phenomenon. Georgetown University historian and Professor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Quigley">Carroll Quigley</a>, who served as President Bill Clinton’s mentor, for example, wrote about the scheme in his 1966 book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_And_Hope"><em>Tragedy And Hope: A History Of The World In Our Time</em></a>. The heavyweight academic, who was allowed to review documents belonging to the top echelons of the global establishment, even explained how the corrupt system would work — remarkably similar to what Hudes describes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole,” wrote Prof. Quigley, who agreed with the goals but not the secrecy. “This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world&#8217;s central banks which were themselves private corporations.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it is not going to happen, Hudes said — at least not if she has something do to with it. While the media are dominated by the “power grabber” network, Hudes has been working with foreign governments, reporters, U.S. officials, state governments, and a broad coalition of fellow whistleblowers to blow the entire scam wide open. There has been quite a bit of interest, too, particularly among foreign governments and state officials in the United States.</p>
<p>Citing the wisdom of America’s Founding Fathers in creating a federal system of government with multiple layers of checks and balances, Hudes said she was confident that the network would eventually be exposed and subjected to the rule of law, stopping the secret corruption. If and when that happens — even if it may be disorderly — Hudes says precious metals will once again play a role in<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/economics/item/15042-arizona-legislature-approves-gold-and-silver-as-money"> imposing discipline on the monetary system</a>. The rule of law would also be restored, she said, and the public will demand a proper press to stay informed.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have a cleaned-up financial system, that’s where it is going, but in the meantime, people who didn’t know how the system was gamed are going to find out,” she said. “We’re going to have a different kind of international financial system&#8230;. It’ll be a new kind of world where people know what’s going on — no more backroom deals; that’s not going to keep happening. We’re going to have a different kind of media if people don’t want to be dominated and controlled, which I don’t think they do.”</p>
<p>While Hudes sounded upbeat, she recognizes that the world is facing serious danger right now — there are even plans in place to impose martial law in the United States, she said. The next steps will be critical for humanity. As such, Hudes argues, it is crucial that the people of the world find out about the lawlessness, corruption, and thievery that are going on at the highest levels — and put a stop to it once and for all. The consequences of inaction would be disastrous.</p>

<p>Government is bad for personal freedom. That argument is premised upon the truism that everything government does interferes with freedom because it either prohibits or compels. Everything it owns it has taken from others. Much of what it says is divorced from the truth. President Obama, like President George W. Bush, has argued that his first job is to keep America safe, and if he impairs personal freedom in the process, that is a small price to pay for safety. Many of my colleagues in the media on the left and right have bought this argument, notwithstanding its fallacies.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>This past week, we learned that the IRS has targeted for additional scrutiny the tax exemption applications of groups with whose messages it disagrees. We also learned that the Department of Justice obtained the personal telephone records of hundreds of reporters and editors employed by the Associated Press without a search warrant issued by a judge. And during this past week we learned that the White House, the Department of State and the CIA all engaged in a conspiracy of disinformation so that the official version of events of what caused the murders of four Americans at our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, would not impair Obama’s re-election campaign in 2012.</p>
<p>The common threads in all of this government secrecy and lying are a general rejection of government’s moral obligation to tell the truth, a disturbing yet brazen willingness to evade and avoid the restrictions the Constitution has deliberately built around government, and a glib admission that the government can do as it pleases so long as it can politically get away with it.</p>
<p>The Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause requires that the government treat all similarly situated entities in a similar manner. The Constitution’s First Amendment prohibits the government from using the speech and expressive activities of persons in America as a basis for the disparate treatment of them.</p>
<p>Thus, on its face – that is, on the basis of what the IRS has admitted and without any further investigation – we have violations of these constitutional principles. If the IRS were to examine the applications for tax exemption of Media Matters with the same level of scrutiny as it does with Tea Party Patriots, it would not run afoul of these principles. But Congress has given the IRS broad latitude to scrutinize the behavior of the taxpayers it chooses to scrutinize, and the IRS has given itself authority to probe, prod and plunder wherever it wishes. I say “given itself,” because the IRS has rule-making power, which when overlooked by Congress (as is almost always the case) actually serves to enhance IRS powers beyond what Congress permits.</p>
<p>Short of criminal behavior such as bribery or conspiracy, the IRS employees who have singled out applications for tax exempt status for more scrutiny based on anticipated political expression are subject to removal from office, but they cannot be prosecuted or sued. Here again, Congress is to blame, as both Republicans and Democrats have used and abused the IRS to their advantage, and neither party inwardly wants laws that will prevent it from doing so in the future. Is this what you expect of our tax collectors?</p>
<p>The First Amendment also assures the right of professional journalists to seek and protect their sources, and it gives them immunity from government prosecution or retribution for truthfully publishing matters of material public interest, even when it involves information stolen from the government. The Supreme Court taught us this in the Pentagon Papers case.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Fourth Amendment requires that if the government wants private information about who stole its secrets, it needs a search warrant from a judge. But the Patriot Act, which was celebrated by some in the media whose telephone records have since been seized, permits federal agents to write their own search warrants when they seek records from a third party like a telephone company and can claim that pursuit of terrorists is at stake. The Patriot Act makes a mockery of the Fourth Amendment, and the government knows that. When the government chills free speech, we all suffer. Thomas Jefferson preferred newspapers without government to government without newspapers. Whose personal records will the government authorize itself to seize next?</p>
<p>The lesson of Benghazi is that we had no lawful right to interfere in the domestic affairs of the Libyan government. It was unlawful for Obama to bomb Col. Gadhafi without a congressional declaration of war. The organized assault on our consulate was the unintended consequence of us using force to infuse American-style democracy on a people whose culture is unable and unwilling to accept it.</p>
<p>But the president’s people were terrified that the murder of our ambassador to Libya during the 2012 presidential campaign might impair Obama’s re-election chances. So they and he tried to rewrite history, and the more they and he lied the more they and he needed to lie to cover up their original lies. Would you retain an employee who lied to you about the deaths of innocents and lied more to cover up the original lies?</p>
<p>Now, back to Bush and Obama and the president’s job. According to the Constitution, the president’s first job obligation is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. According to the Constitution, that means preserving Americans’ freedom first and safety second. Freedom is our natural state and is the ultimate natural right. Safety is a need that we ourselves can provide when unimpeded by the government. If the president keeps us safe but not free, he is not doing his job. Do you know anyone who feels freer or even any safer because the government trampled personal freedoms and so far has gotten away with it?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/america-in-chains3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/america-in-chains2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>US democracy is illusory. America never was beautiful. It’s not the land of the free and home of the brave. It wasn’t created that way. More than ever, it’s not now.</p>
<p align="left">Freedom is a four-letter word. It’s fast disappearing. It’s an endangered species. Wealth, power and privilege alone matter. America’s war on terror priorities advance them.</p>
<p align="left">International, constitutional and US statute laws are spurned. Rogue state ruthlessness replaced them. Boston’s unprecedented lockdown suggests what’s coming. It covered a two hundred square mile area. An important threshold was crossed.</p>
<p align="left">Martial law terrorized city residents. Constitutional rights were suspended. Perhaps it was prelude to what’s coming. It can happen anywhere across America. It can show up nationwide.</p>
<p align="left">Thousands of heavily armed militarized police, National Guard troops, FBI Swat teams, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operatives, Drug Enforcement Administration agents, and perhaps other federal, state and local enforcers showed what full-blown tyranny looks like.</p>
<p align="left">Defying public diktats risked arrest or getting shot. Helicopters hovered low over neighborhoods. House-to-house searches ordered pajama-clad families outside.</p>
<p align="left">Without probable cause, some were handcuffed and/or placed face down on sidewalks. Others were publicly strip-searched. Imagine what’s coming next time. Freedom in America’s on the chopping block for elimination.</p>
<p align="left">What’s ongoing already includes:</p>
<p align="left">• numerous police state laws;</p>
<p align="left">• waging war on humanity;</p>
<p align="left">• indefinite detentions without evidence, charges or trials;</p>
<p align="left">• forced disappearances;</p>
<p align="left">• targeted assassinations;</p>
<p align="left">• torture and other forms of abuse;</p>
<p align="left">• Big Brother surveillance;</p>
<p align="left">• warrantless searches;</p>
<p align="left">• other privacy invasions;</p>
<p align="left">• false flag national security abuses;</p>
<p align="left">• war on terror fear-mongering;</p>
<p align="left">• military commission trials, including for US citizens;</p>
<p align="left">• domestic military force deployments;</p>
<p align="left">• secret FEMA concentration camps;</p>
<p align="left">• racial profiling and persecution;</p>
<p align="left">• militarized local police;</p>
<p align="left">• criminalizing whistleblowers; and</p>
<p align="left">• targeting non-believers for supporting right over wrong.</p>
<p align="left">Tyranny isn’t in the eye of the beholder. It’s escalating in plane sight. It’s just a matter of time until it’s full-blown. Washington’s bipartisan criminal class plans it.</p>
<p align="left">It’s hard-right, unbridled, reactionary, and pro-corporate. It’s anti-democratic, anti-dissent, anti-freedom, anti-civil and human rights, anti-social justice, anti-environmental sanity, and anti-government of, by and for everyone.</p>
<p align="left">It’s dangerous living in America at the wrong time. Supporting right over wrong is threatened. Anyone can be targeted for any reason or none at all. Guilt by accusation is policy. Diktat authority has final say.</p>
<p align="left">The National Coalition to Protect Civil Freedoms (NCPCF) includes national and local organizations. Its mission is:</p>
<p align="left">“To educate the public about the erosion of civil and political freedoms in the society, and the abuses of prisoners within the US criminal justice system especially after 9/11, and to advocate for the preservation of those freedoms and to defend those rights according to the US Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its related UN Conventions, and the Geneva Conventions.”</p>
<p align="left">Civil liberties are threatened, it warns. Public safety at the expense of freedom assures neither.</p>
<p align="left">Post-9/11, thought crime prosecutions followed. Individuals and groups were targeted for “their beliefs, thoughts, or associations.”</p>
<p align="left">Doing so violates constitutional protections. First Amendment freedoms are compromised. They’re fundamental. Without them, all others are at risk.</p>
<p align="left">They include free speech, a free press, free thought, culture and intellectual inquiry, assembly, freedom to practice the religion of one’s choice, and to petition government for redress of grievances.</p>
<p align="left">The Bill of Rights Defense Committee (BORDC) “defend(s) the rule of law and rights and liberties challenged by overbroad national security and counter-terrorism policies.”</p>
<p align="left">It “support(s) an ideologically, ethnically, geographically, and generationally diverse grassroots movement to protect and restore these principles by encouraging widespread civic participation; educating people about the significance of our rights; and cultivating grassroots networks to convert concern, outrage, and fear into debate and action.”</p>
<p align="left">Its “Campaign for the Constitution” headlines: “Building a Movement. Restoring Rights. Reclaiming Our Constitution.” At issue is restoring lost rights. Bipartisan complicity compromised them en route to eliminating them altogether.</p>
<p align="left">Rule of law protections “withered under warrantless surveillance, rampant racial and religious profiling, and torture – and even human experimentation – with impunity.”</p>
<p align="left">The ACLU highlights lost digital age civil liberties. New technologies compromised existing protections. Post-9/11, they’ve undergone serious erosion.</p>
<p align="left">Web site visits are tracked. Cell phones log our movements. Emails and social network communications are monitored and stored. Warrantless spying is policy.</p>
<p align="left">“Things we once thought could only happen in far-away enemy states or distant dystopias are suddenly happening here in America” said ACLU.</p>
<p align="left">Privacy laws haven’t kept up with technology. War on terror priorities matter most.</p>
<p align="left">Protecting civil liberties in the digital age requires “ensur(ing) that expressive, associational, and privacy rights are strengthened rather than compromised by new technology.”</p>
<p align="left">It’s also about “protect(ing) these core democratic rights against intrusive corporate and government practices that rely on new technology to invade these rights.”</p>
<p align="left">They’re being systematically destroyed. According to the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), Washington “consistently (doesn’t) recognize the protections afforded by the US Constitution and international law, and in doing so, it has failed in its responsibility to maintain a democratic society that is both open to, and accountable to, the people.”</p>
<p align="left">Government is shrouded in secrecy. Checks and balances no longer matter. Bill of Rights freedoms are fading. They’re fundamental in democratic societies.</p>
<p align="left">War on terror priorities breached First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment freedoms. At issue are search and surveillance authority, indefinitely detaining citizens and non-citizens uncharged, and undermining free expression, due process, and equal protection.</p>
<p align="left">Washington’s criminal class is bipartisan. Ahead expect much worse. Old time radio listeners recall a memorable Jack Benny skit. “Your money or your life,” a robber asked?</p>
<p align="left">After a pause, he was asked again. He responded saying “I’m thinking it over.”</p>
<p align="left">Today no one’s asked. It isn’t either-or. It’s both.</p>
<p align="left">A Final Comment</p>
<p align="left">Fixing America’s dysfunctional system demands fundamental change. It starts by reforming the nation’s sham electoral process. Throwing out bums assures new ones.</p>
<p align="left">Both major parties are two sides of the same coin. Not a dime’s worth of difference separates them. Secrecy and back room deals substitute for a free, fair and open process. Duopoly power rules.</p>
<p align="left">Party bosses chose candidates. Big money owns them. Voters have no say. They get the best democracy money can buy. It happens every time.</p>
<p align="left">The entire process was constitutionally flawed by design. Over time, things got worse. Bipartisan politics serves serves wealth, power, and privilege. Popular interests go begging.</p>
<p align="left">Money power runs America. It games the system. It does so destructively. Controlling money, credit and debt for private enrichment assures speculation, booms, busts, inflation, deflation, instability, crisis, recessions and depressions.</p>
<p align="left">It assures transferring enormous amounts of wealth from ordinary people to corporate giants and super-rich elites already with too much.</p>
<p align="left">Washington is Wall Street occupied territory. What financial giants want, they get. They’re waging financial war on humanity. They’re more powerful than standing armies.</p>
<p align="left">Economies are strip-mined for profit. Communities are laid waste. Ordinary people are impoverished and left out. Vital needs go begging.</p>
<p align="left">Money power in private hands and democracy can’t co-exist. Complicit politicians betray the public trust. They do so for benefits they derive.</p>
<p align="left">Social injustice defines official policy. Class war rages more than ever. America’s on a fast track toward tyranny. Stopping it requires free, fair and open elections. It’s also about returning money to public hands where it belongs.</p>

<p>Any discussion on liberty presupposes an understanding of human nature. Today, the utter confusion and distorted mindset of humankind, relegates animal instincts, as the premier motivation for salacious existence. The criteria for a cordial civilization have long been &#8220;<em>consigned to the dustbins of history</em>&#8220;. Standards for civil and moral conduct are debased by a global disintegration to achieve the ‘good’ for the hunt of acting ‘nice’. Polite and pleasant facades are no substitute for truth and meaning. Yet, the heights of evil transactions seem to be hailed routinely, as the only achievement that power hungry sociopaths aspire to impose on the rest of the planet. Never-ending conflict is inherent in the human condition, while the state of liberty is unusual and resides within the character of the ethical spirit.</p>
<p>The spread of international humanism as a social value-system is fundamentally hedonistic. The pretence of caring about humanity by adopting a regulatory anatomical structure of benign coercion has relegated individual dignity to the graves of a universal cemetery. At every turn in the propaganda evangelism cycle, the media masters preach a gospel of fake tolerance and respect, while implementing policies and dictates, based upon hate and oppression.</p>
<p>The confessedly exposed religion of their belief is in a hegemonic demon of worldwide enslavement. The defect in the progressive creed requires the extermination of individualistic sovereignty. The whole, as long as it conforms to the orthodox version of subjugation, requires every unique person, to obey the community master of social welfare.</p>
<p>According to the Barack Hussein Obama II epithet, the epistle of his self-indulgence lecture is offered up as a path to worldly happiness. Mere mortals need to sacrifice their integrity to a demon deity, upon an altar of desolation and abandonment. The devil of state adoration demands mandatory veneration.</p>
<p>Hell on earth is the inevitable result from the elimination of personal liberty. The foundation of civilization rests upon the free will of each mortal and the cement of society is the ability of every person to make independent decisions and accept responsibility for their actions. The principles of the Christian gospel, the sacred heritage of the worth in each person and the traditional values of the golden rule are immutable and indisputable. Even so, the collectivist culture rejects the very core cornerstone that has provided the only intermittent sanctuary from the pillaging of the barbarians.</p>
<p>Even an eastern establishment agent like The Atlantic has to admit the evident in the article, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/01/theres-no-room-for-civil-liberties-in-obamas-inauguration-view-of-america/267422/">There&#8217;s No Room for Civil Liberties in Obama&#8217;s Inauguration View of America</a>. Wendy Kaminer uses the erroneous illusion of a difference in a partisan political ideology. &#8220;The authoritarian right and egalitarian left meet in the middle on at least one issue: Neither side values the rights of the individual.&#8221; Stating the obvious, there is no manifest departure within the communalist system that hates any citizen objections to the supremacy of the State. Ms. Kaminer continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Civil libertarians have been cataloguing and futilely litigating the gross abuses of post-9/11 era for years. They include, but are probably not limited to, summary detention and torture; the prosecution of whistleblowers; surveillance of peaceful protesters; the criminalization of journalism and peaceful human-rights activism; extensive blacklisting that would have been the envy of Joe McCarthy; and secrecy about a shadow legal system that makes the president&#8217;s &#8220;we the people&#8221; trope seem less inspirational than sarcastic.</p>
<p>Precisely because civil libertarians have focused on these abuses, they&#8217;re old news &#8212; which means that progressives reveling in Obama&#8217;s speech can&#8217;t claim ignorance of them. When they applaud the president&#8217;s &#8220;muscular liberalism,&#8221; without qualification, they&#8217;re effectively applauding his strong-arm security state.</p>
<p>When Obama praised collective action in his address, he wasn&#8217;t praising efforts by individuals to organize against government abuses. He was praising organized support for government programs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Conversely, concluding that the state is the ultimate enemy of the individual, missing the true lesson of the human experience. The addiction to authoritarian discipline is not motivated primarily out of a fear of reprisals, but more often stems from a desire to belong to a social order. The dread of being labeled an outsider and a social misfit creates more self-imposed compliance, with an acceptable politically correct stance, than the threat of fines or incarceration.</p>
<p>The artificial disposition of public or even interpersonal discourse, illustrates the extent and length people go to avoid asking the most profound questions, much less an attempt to discover answers for social issues. The lack of meaningful dialogue is symptomatic of a terminal disease that strips away the flesh from the bone of a cadaver, awaiting a funeral.</p>
<p>The essence of a reasoned relationship with another person or an entire society must be founded upon a mutual respect and common interest. How can a solitary national bear loyalty to a government that tramples inherent rights, which are ordained by God at birth, not delegated by government fiat?</p>
<p>With the unholy alliance of the corporatist/state fascist economy, the model of a system of psychopathic delusion becomes the official reality. People relish in their self-induced mental illness and celebrate their diminished capacity from accepting their subservient and docile role. Liberty cannot survive when citizenry willingly surrender.</p>
<p>Mark Tapscott makes the case that <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/2011/03/individual-liberty-cannot-survive-republic-civic-dunces">Individual liberty cannot survive a republic of civic dunces</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As with so much else, James Madison captures the profoundly serious implications of raising a generation politically crippled by its gross civic ignorance in a single concise statement about the difference between Europe and America: &#8220;In Europe, charters of liberty have been granted by power. America has set the example &#8230; of charters of power granted by liberty.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If you don’t grasp how Madison’s simple equation makes all the difference in the world in how this country is governed, then you probably don’t understand why liberals and conservatives disagree on just about everything.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Obama administration is engaged in the Europeanization of America. Note this transition removes the historic race, ethnic and cultural differences, that created the vibrant civilization, which produced Western thought and social institutions. In its place, a new world order of an ecumenical hierarchy of globalist plutocrats, running a technological prison planet of apes, is in the making.</p>
<p><img alt="planetapes.jpg" src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/planetapes.jpg" width="300" align="left" /><br />
No liberty exists for anthropoids! Ironically, <em>&#8220;the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_(1968_film)">Forbidden Zone</a> was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago&#8221;, applies to the authoritarians that would be King Kong in domain of Dr. Zaius. When George Taylor laments, &#8220;YOU MANIACS! YOU BLEW IT UP! OH, DAMN YOU! GODDAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!’; the fans of the POTUS dictatorship, whoever is in office at the time, deserves their oblivion.</em>Is it so difficult to see the destructive conversion going on in a country that once understood the purpose of the American Revolution? The preachers from the pulpits of press conferences want you to believe that their pronouncements are from on high. The fools, who extend them credibility in the face of official tyranny, much less their acquiescence and submission, are endorsing treason.</p>
<p>Liberty must be defended, not with superior firepower, but with eternal determination. Since the lack of willpower is the critical problem, what would it take to motivate the lethargic minions to take real affirmative action? Pray tell the squeamish dare not get involved. Just the mere thought of offending your overlords, is far too audacious, in a feeble attempt to practice personal self-respect.</p>
<p>The village of the damned is as close as your adjacent neighborhood. Living a life of liberty is too intrepid of a concept for most registered party voters. As the evidence mounts that, the dictatorship of the proletariat is not confined solely to Marxist regimes, but is eminently thriving in the land of the former brave and bold.</p>
<p>The Madisonian framework model of federalism and separation of powers is long dead. Even the appearance of Liberty in public institutions is scorned upon as an affront to the supremacy of state authority. Individual autonomy and specific actions is the principle purpose of the genuine patriot, while the last refuge of the scoundrel is the pledge of allegiance to the admiralty flag.</p>
<p>Since the decline of the original Republic, the chronicle into totalitarianism is nearly complete. Now the gatekeepers of the oligarchy look and act like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_(1968_film)">Dr. Zaius</a>. When he admits that he has always known that human civilization existed long before apes ruled the planet, he really is saying that the nation was once lead by representatives of sovereign individuals and is now ruled by egomaniac tyrants that like to whip their knuckle dragging serfs.The reason the country is doomed lies squarely upon the shoulders of the docile. With the criminalization of society, the faint-hearted demand harsher penalties for anyone, who defies the slave state. Do not just blame the elites sitting on high for all the ills of our national plight. The little people, gaming the system, bear the scarlet letter of shame for their lust of government adoration. As long as the rebellion of courage remains in a stage of limbo, the cowardly primates of Amerika will obey their orders.</p>

<p>Only a media masochist can stand watching network and cable TV news. The extent of self-immolation coming out of their broadcasts, have seldom been more vivid, with their bizarre reports on the Boston Marathon bombing. If one did not know better, the comparison with the Marx Brothers antics would have you believe that you have a ringside seat <a href="http://www.marx-brothers.org/watching/film/At_the_Circus.htm">At the Circus</a>. Silly behavior is the mainstay of the mainstream media. Real news investigation has long ago been relegated to the archives of a half century ago, when there was at least a small measure of a healthy distrust of government sources. Today the clowns that act as ventriloquist dummies have more in common with Karl Marx than <em>Groucho.</em></p>
<p>The passion of lies flows from the lips of the talking heads, as they get their instructions from corporatist producers in their earpiece. The latest example of a Mossad agent and Zionist exponent is the infamous liar, CNN Wolf Blitzer. <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/4/18/a_rush_to_misjudgment_cnn_faulted">A Rush to Misjudgment</a>, states, “CNN is coming under criticism after it falsely reported authorities had arrested a Boston Marathon bombing suspect, whom it had earlier described as a &#8220;dark-skinned male.&#8221; Catching Blitzer tap dancing around the blowup of the designed script of placing culpability on the intended stooges, selected to advance the domestic <em><a href="http://batr.org/911/">war of terror</a></em>, reminds of a skit played by <em>Chico</em> in a bad version of Monkey Business.</p>
<p>That other CNN and CIA plant, Anderson Cooper provides the complementary tag team effort to confuse and distract on a news production that even the global radical and former network owner Ted Turner has to hang his head. Cooper plays the role of Harpo as Pinky as he stirs the Duck Soup broth disinformation. The only way to watch &#8220;the government news hour&#8221; is with the volume on the Harpo setting - <em>silent</em> no verbal talk.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone the Fox News Network features another CNN alumnus, Bill Hemmer as their <em>Zeppo</em>, performing relatively straight (non-comedic) roles as an authoritive source for an authoritarian mindset of neoconservatives. Deceiving real liberty loving viewers with a pseudo patriotic flag waving is the hallmark of the <em>fair and balanced</em> news format now that Rupert Murdoch is the target of the globalists cabal to act friendly with their new world order scheme.</p>
<p>The next hack over at MSNBC, Chris “<em>Gummo</em>” Matthews on &#8220;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/chris-matthews-boston-bombings-domestic-terrorists-tend-far-063028054.html">Hardball</a>&#8221; tonight, the host openly questioned whether at least a portion of the horror was an intentional attack against the Democratic Party. What class from this dedicated Marxist brother in media prevarications?</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me ask you about domestic terrorism as a category. Normally, domestic terrorists, people tend to be on the far right, well that&#8217;s not a good category, just extremists, let&#8217;s call them that. Do they advertise after they do something like this? Do they try to get credit as a group or do they just hate America so much or its politics or its government that they just want to do the damage, they don&#8217;t care if they get public credit, if you will?&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/msnbc-nra-business-helping-bombers-get-away-their-crimes_718001.html">Weekly Standard</a>, the quid essential NeoCon diatribe publication, lashes out at MSNBC as an adjunct enabler of the globalist agenda.</p>
<p>“MSNBC host Lawrence O&#8217;Donnell made the case this evening that the National Rifle Association is to blame for the slow investigation into the Boston bombings:</p>
<p>&#8220;There are new developments tonight in the bombing investigation here in Boston,&#8221; said O&#8217;Donnell. &#8220;But that investigation could be moving faster were it not for the successful lobbying efforts of the National Rifle Association. The NRA&#8217;s efforts to guarantee that American mass murderers are the best-equipped mass murders in the world is not limited to murderers who use assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The NRA is also in the business of helping bombers get away with their crimes. Gunpowder could be traced by investigators to a buyer at the point of sale if gunpowder contained a taggant, an element that would enable tracing of the purchase of gunpowder. But thanks to the National Rifle Association, identification taggants are required by law only in plastic explosives. The NRA has successfully blocked any requirements for such taggants in gunpowder. So such supremely helpful evidence as taggants are not available to the FBI in this investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bombings took place at Monday&#8217;s marathon.”</p>

<p>For an even more revolting low in propaganda, the MSNBC: <a href="http://youtu.be/PneglmKv8NA">NRA &#8216;in the Business of Helping Bombers Get Away With Their Crimes&#8217;</a> You Tube, is typical of a state sponsored Pravda style media misinformation, that now passes as journalism. Now compare this garbage MSNBC government coordinated onslaught with the perceptive, daring and provocative coverage on <a href="http://rt.com/shows/breaking-set-summary/">Breaking the Set</a>, with host Abby Martin that is aired on RT TV. The video broadcast of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xxkSDLWGXs&amp;feature=youtu.be">Corporate Media Disaster Porn | Weapons of Mass Distraction</a>, raises the issue that the corporate media is reporting false information. The long record of government drill operations during &#8220;so called&#8221; terrorist events might well prove to apply to the Boston Marathon massacre.</p>
<p>At the forefront of this speculation, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/false-flag-alex-jones-boston-marathon-bombing-family-231742713.html">Yahoo News</a> lays claim that Alex Jones raises ‘false flag’ conspiracy after Boston Marathon bombings.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jones suggested that the FBI orchestrated the bombings under the false flag of a terrorist organization in order to justify expanded security powers. The Boston attack, he theorized, was staged by the U.S. government to extend the reach of both the Dept. of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With the FBI suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev dead and his brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at large and now captured, it will take some serious investigatory reporting in order to penetrate the layers of government secrecy that reasonably can be expected to conceal what actually transpired on April 15, 2013. Still, the <em>lamestream</em> media will never report any evidence that conflicts with the homeland security police. The presence of sensible alternative explanations are consistently dismissed when the war of terror needs another jolt of fear to keep the public on edge.</p>
<p>Believing any of the government press releases that pass as independent news reporting is more risky than taking your chances in a world of deranged psychopaths. Simply stated, no one in the &#8220;so called&#8221; know has the inside track on all the complexity of the official investigation, or the potential compartmental complicity in a sanctioned undercover mission.</p>
<p>Where are the brave correspondents that would dare shout from the rooftops, that the response from the Boston carnage is virtually a green light for lock down martial law on the public? Just look to the Faux resident pinhead, Bill O’Reilly for bold reporting, <a href="http://www.infowars.com/bill-oreilly-attacks-alex-jones-and-infowars-for-daring-to-ask-questions-about-boston-bomber-narrative/">Bill O’Reilly Attacks Alex Jones and Infowars for Daring to Ask Questions About Boston Bomber Narrative</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Fox resident blowhard Bill O’Reilly and correspondent Juliet Huddy have attacked Alex Jones and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOs4wxaatuo">Infowars.com reporter Dan Bidondi</a>. For the two Fox News talking heads it is apparently a serious crime to quiz Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick about the false flag attack in Boston on Monday. It is impermissible to call into question the validity of the official narrative now coagulating around the event. It is forbidden to deviate from the establishment’s script.Huddy dismissed Jones and Bidondi as &#8220;idiots&#8221; and the accused sexual predator O’Reilly – who has strongly condemned the First Amendment in the past and has shilled for mass murder in Iraq and Afghanistan – made his disgust manifestly apparent, as usual. Both displayed contempt for the internet and alternative media, a quite natural reaction from two irrelevant teleprompter readers. Fox News in particular and the rest of the bloated script-reading dinosaur media in general are seriously threatened by free expression and news reportage on the web.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Viewers that still watch, let alone believe, the fabrications coming out of the bowls of the presstitutesneed a reality check. Just think of all the naive clones that pay their cable or satellite charges for the privilege of bonding with the establishment mouthpieces. What you get from the mind control media is a government version of indoctrination into a slave society. Denial of even the possibility of a <a href="http://www.infowars.com/breaking-police-confirm-infowars-photos-of-boston-suspects">false flag operation</a> in the underlying exercise is the only reporting you are supposed to watch. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/fbi-tells-america-believe-us-and-no-one-else/">FBI tells America: believe us and no one else</a>, outlines the official dictates from the ranks of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O5CJhPZNdk&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLF15FA19E97EF3B2E">G-man enforcers</a>, &#8220;<em>The implication is clear: there is official truth and then there is everything else.</em>&#8220;Since the fascination of following, another manhunt with live feeds is so compelling to the trained seals that are pinned to the screen, the significance of a tyrannical takedown of an entire region of law-abiding citizens, goes unreported by the whores that read from the government approved teleprompters. The autocue message is sanitized of any possibility that the crew of a covert operative drill might just provide cover for a despotic counterattack to the <em>shot heard around the world</em>.</p>
<p>Americans are so easily duped. The Marxist media feed <em>Animal Crackers</em> to a dumb downed public that swallows a systematic federalization of genuine peace keeping functions. The true race in Boston is to re-establish the rebirth of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>A government whistleblower, disclosing classified secrets, risks criminal charges. Defining restricted material usually includes a broad scope of information that casts officials or agencies in a compromising embarrassment. The idea that public servants may be engaged in violating laws is no excuse for blowing the whistle on such abuses if it involves &#8220;National Security&#8221;. This <em>protect the state</em> attitude at all cost argument, is the very definition of institutional cover-up. In war, truth is the first casualty, so said Aeschylus.</p>
<p>So throwing the book at Bradley Manning comes as no surprise. Why should anyone be concerned about the intentional dissemination of raw evidence about war crimes, committed in the name of the War of Terror? Most would fail to be moved by the motivations of a stoic prisoner, who uploaded secured computer files to <a href="https://www.bradleymanning.org/learn-more/what-did-wikileaks-reveal">WikiLeaks</a>. Many would cheer his interminable incarceration for disclosing military records.</p>
<p>Yet, before you slam the jail shut, reflect upon the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/foreign-affairs-defense/wikisecrets/audio-leaked-of-bradley-mannings-court-statement/">Secretly Recorded Audio Leaked of Bradley Manning&#8217;s Court Statement</a>. Listen to the <a href="http://soundcloud.com/buzzfeed/bradley-mannings-full">Full Statement</a>.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QdK4LH51I2g" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, view the YouTube video, <a href="http://youtu.be/QdK4LH51I2gmes">Bradley Manning Tells Court Public Have the Right to Know About US War Crimes</a>.A cogent reaction from another renowned whistleblower, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-ellsberg/bradley-manning-military-court-speech_b_2859353.html">Daniel Ellsberg</a> of the Pentagon Papers fame, carries the weight of a brave man from another era.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s important to remember through all this that Manning has already pled guilty to ten charges of violating military regulations (few of which, if any would be civilian crimes) and faces twenty years in jail. Yet the prosecutors are still going ahead with the absurd charge of &#8220;aiding the enemy,&#8221; a capital offense, of which the prosecutors are asking for life in prison.</p>
<p>Nixon could have brought that charge against me too. I was revealing wrongdoing by our government in a public way, and that information could have been read by our enemies in Vietnam. Of course, I never had that intent and Manning didn&#8217;t either. We both leaked information to provoke a domestic debate about military force and government secrecy. And to say we did so to aid the enemy is absurd.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In any political trial, the spirit of the law is sacrificed for the expediency of protecting a debased regime. Balance in prosecution is a concept unknown to a government consumed with punishing any perceived enemy of the state.</p>
<p>Attorney Floyd Abrams and Professor Yochai Benkler provide a thoughtful perspective and legal opinion in The New York Times editorial - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/opinion/the-impact-of-the-bradley-manning-case.html?_r=0">Death to Whistle-Blowers?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Under the prosecution&#8217;s theory, because Private Manning knew the materials would be published and that Al Qaeda could read them once published, he indirectly communicated with the enemy. But in this theory, whether publication is by WikiLeaks or The Times is entirely beside the point. Defendants are guilty of &#8220;aiding the enemy&#8221; for leaking to a publishing medium simply because that publication can be read by anyone with an Internet connection.</p>
<p>Private Manning&#8217;s guilty plea gives the prosecution an opportunity to rethink its strategy. The extreme charges remaining in this case create a severe threat to future whistle-blowers, even when their revelations are crystal-clear instances of whistle-blowing. We cannot allow our concerns about terrorism to turn us into a country where communicating with the press can be prosecuted as a capital offense.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>No such mercy from the imperial empire, Manning must suffer the supreme wrath for his transgressions. His admissions acknowledge expected official sanctions, but the sentiment of Daniel Ellsberg reflects the standpoint of many Manning supporters.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;&#8230;For the third straight year, Manning has been nominated for the Noble Peace Prize by, among others, Tunisian parliamentarians. Given the role the WikiLeaks cables played in the Arab Spring, and their role in speeding up the end of the Iraq War, I can think of no one more deserving who is deserving of the peace prize.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also deserving of the Congressional Medal of Honor. This medal, awarded by Congress-and not the executive branch-is given to military personnel, who during wartime, do what they should do for their country and their comrades, at the greatest risk to themselves.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ylKWivA3B4M" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another target of recrimination, seen in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibel_Edmonds">Sibel Edmonds</a> dismissal is a classic example of punishing the whistleblower. Edmonds took a job as a translator at the FBI shortly after 9-11. Her story, stated in the YouTube interview, <a href="http://youtu.be/ylKWivA3B4M">The Government Is Raping You: Sibel Edmonds</a>, is compelling.</p>
<p><a href="http://warisacrime.org/content/sibel-edmonds-finally-wins">Sibel Edmonds Finally Wins</a>, documents her observation in the book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.classifiedwoman.com/buy-book/">Classified Woman</a>&#8221; and offers a disturbing assessment of her fellow workers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Edmonds found at the FBI translation unit almost entirely two types of people. The first group was corrupt sociopaths, foreign spies, cheats and schemers indifferent to or working against U.S. national security. The second group was fearful bureaucrats unwilling to make waves. The ordinary competent person with good intentions who risks their job to &#8220;say something if you see something&#8221; is the rarest commodity. Hence the elite category that Edmonds found herself almost alone in: whistleblowers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This characterization of morally challenged federal employees is a direct consequence of a system that protects the cover-ups, while punishing disclosure of conflicting evidence of outright corruption. The silent culture of concealment or the worse incentive system of collusion runs the governing bureaucracies.</p>
<p>The <em>presstitutes</em> in the establishment media enable the warmongering protection racket as a condition of employment. Their lack of investigative reporting is only superseded by their ominous distortion of real patriotic loyalty. Whistleblowers function as detectives doing the job that reporters abdicate. Woefully, so few citizens of conscience are willing to jeopardize their individual circumstance for the courage of genuine national security.</p>
<p>The always insightful, William F. Jasper of the New American writes in <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/books/item/13807-sibel-edmonds-classified-woman">Sibel Edmonds&#8217; &#8220;Classified Woman&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="edmonds.jpg" src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/edmonds.jpg" align="left" /></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Unfortunately, most of Edmonds&#8217; contributing editors at <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/">BoilingFrogs</a> are decidedly left of center, and their anti-globalist, anti-war, anti-police-state arguments and analyses tend to range from the &#8220;progressive&#8221; to the Marxoid. However, when she went public and came under attack, it wasn&#8217;t Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh who came to her defense; it was the anti-Bush Left that rallied to her aid. In fact, the faux conservatives at FOX, National Review, and the radio talk show universe alternately ignored and attacked her; they were busy cheerleading George W. Bush&#8217;s unconstitutional wars abroad and his unconstitutional police-state measures at home. Sympathetic coverage for Edmonds from alternative media on the Right has been woefully lacking, with a few exceptions.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In April 2011, Sibel Edmonds submitted her manuscript for Classified Womanto the FBI for review, as required by terms of her employment agreement. Under that agreement, the FBI has 30 days to approve and/or require deletions and revisions. After waiting over 340 days with no response from the bureau, Edmonds took the path that few others have taken; she published anyway. However, with every publisher afraid to touch it, she was forced to publish it on her own. She knows that any day now the Obama administration, which has prosecuted more whistleblowers than all previous administrations combined, may come after her.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Forget about the false left-right paradigm. The &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/911/">War of Terror</a>&#8221; being waged by the imperium empire is designed to crush whistleblowers, and keep the brain dead in a zombie trance. Just consider the impact on the Afghanistan campaign if the FBI acted upon the evidence unclosed by Sibel Edmonds that cuts to the heart of the 911 myth assumptions.</p>
<p>The military-industrial-security-intelligence complex closes ranks to protect their &#8220;<a href="http://batr.org/view_/093001.html">Splendid Little Wars</a>&#8220;. The whistleblowers that expose the lies out of the War Party establishment are only a minor distraction, as long as the public sleeps in their self-induced coma. The Army Times item, <a href="http://www.armytimes.com/news/2013/03/ap-officials-say-hagel-to-order-drone-medal-review-031213/">Hagel to order review of drone medal precedence</a>, is one such interlude, while the control and command structure continues to aim their weapons at imaginary threats.</p>
<p>Who would doubt that the Bradley Mannings and Sibel Edmonds, <em>squealers of state secrets</em>, would be prime quarries for the hunt to eliminate enemies of the state? The only good government snitch is a Gitmo captive. So goes the claims of the governance prosecutors.</p>
<p>How many people have actually examined the information in the Manning WikiLeak disclosures or read the Edmonds account of 911-treason complicity? Oh no, the discomfort of confronting the fake reality of the official story of make believe is too disturbing for most people.</p>
<p>Loyalty of country is a very dangerous attitude, when your government sponsors state terrorism as a normal activity. The fear to face up to the horrors of administration deceit is the prime activity of the flag waving drones that cheer for more carnage.</p>
<p>When Edmonds describes the traitors within the national security structure, the fearful bureaucrats facilitate the ongoing treachery that passes for nationalism. When Manning exposes the documents that prove a genocide policy is in effect, the penalty demanded by the bellicose command is his execution.</p>
<p>An honorable whistleblower is a citizen hero. Disobeying dishonest laws is true patriotism. In the end, <a href="http://batr.org/solitary/042912.html">A Different Philosophy of Civil Disobedience</a>, is needed. Complacency is the countrywide disease of choice. Real patriots oppose jingoistic orders. Stand down.</p>
