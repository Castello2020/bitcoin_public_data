			<h4>Origin of the Master Model</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/modern-slavery.jpg" alt="" />The master plan for world domination we see playing out today was first proposed to the US at the end of World War I. However, there were no takers. People were too war weary. However, when the plan was again proposed at the end of World War II, it was accepted. Consequently, World War II quietly transitioned into the secret “war” to set up what has become known as the “new world order” — an absolute dictatorship over the entire planet.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States set up the School of the Americas to train future dictators and terrorists who would be sent out into the world to destroy sovereign nations and place them under US domination by installing puppet governments obedient to the United States. Many conquests were made quietly using clever economic tricks <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>. However, leaders who refused to submit quietly would see their entire country reduced to rubble and the land rendered unlivable by uranium dust scattered by US bombs. The message was clear: Submit to the United States or face total destruction.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">A social model based upon the assumption that cleverness and power automatically convey the right to take anything desired from those who are less adept and unable to resist is not a sustainable model for harmonious social interactions. However, this is the chosen model. The mantra for this model, “A man’s true worth is measured by the amount of other peoples’ happiness that he can <em>possess </em>and <em>destroy</em>” <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote1" name="fn1">[1]</a>, is essentially a call for a class war between the greedy elite and the innocent masses of the world who simply desire a peaceful existence.</p>
<h4>Acquisitions</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The United States looks at the rest of the world as a “resource”. If a country has something — oil, gold, minerals, etc. — that the US covets, it believes it has the right to take those things by whatever means necessary. In many cases the coveted resource is human slave labor. Let’s look at some representative examples:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/US_ThirdWorld/US_Guat.html" target="_blank">Guatemala: The Banana Wars</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">With the cooperation of the dictator, United Fruit Company (US) owned almost half of the country and used the locals as slaves to harvest its Chiquita brand bananas. However, during the period from 1945-1954 new leaders made changes. They helped the poor and set up social security and health care. Then they took land away from United Fruit and gave it to the local people. United fruit complained to the CIA that its business interests were being interfered with by the “communist” government. Any government which shows kindness to the poor and weak is called communist by the US. The US attacked Guatemala — killed the elected leaders and many thousands of citizens — and established a puppet dictatorship which would obey the will of United Fruit. The people were returned to a state of slavery. The CIA trained death squads to make sure the people were crushed into submission.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Strip Mining in Africa <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote4" name="fn4">[4]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">In Africa, the International Monetary Fund — a puppet of the US — destroys a country with strip mining. The original country was self sustaining. People were able to grow lots of food and hunt animals. However, once the land was ruined by US corporations, it was unusable to plant crops and the native animals died. The people had to buy food from other countries with money loaned to them by the IMF which they could never hope to repay. Therefore, a once free and self supporting people were made debt slaves of the IMF. Once all the natural resources have been stolen, the corporations will simply pack up and leave the indigenous people to starve and die.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Countries Used as Trash Dumps <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote5" name="fn5">[5]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Used computers and associated items are dumped in poor countries where starving barefoot children sift through the mess of hazardous waste and broken obsolete glass computer monitors hoping to find something they can sell to get enough money to stay alive another day. Property stickers show the waste is mainly from the US government and various US state governments.</p>
<h4>Corruption of Trusted Sources</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reporters and News Organizations</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The masses are conditioned to believe news they receive from establishment sources. In the earlier times, this assumption was often correct. It was considered so important by the founding fathers that freedom of the press was enshrined in the US constitution. However, times have changed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Walter Cronkite was known as the “trusted voice”. No one knew he was also the official announcer at the secret Bohemian Grove meetings. The leaders of the world’s news organizations also attend this event. That is why, even though the meetings began over one hundred years ago, until recently no one knew this group even existed. President George W. Bush may have set a new record for bribing journalists to allow their trusted name to be used as the author of material actually written by government propaganda experts. Apparently, everyone has a price and the government, of course, has no problem when it comes to money.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">When Ronald Reagan reportedly ordered the death of investigative reporter Jessica Savitch <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote6" name="fn6">[6]</a>, the message to independent journalists was clear: Go against the official party line an you’re done!</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, dedicated journalists face mysterious deaths and strange single car accidents but a few survive long enough to give us a glimpse of truths we would otherwise never know. They are true heroes.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Churches</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are everywhere. Unfortunately, legitimate Spiritual teachers are not. People look at churches either as harmless or with some sort of conditioned hypnotic respect. Churches send out “missionaries”. However, the “mission” of these missionaries may not be so clear. If you wanted to infiltrate a foreign country, these people would be an ideal asset.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Churches are not Spiritual centers. At best, all they want is your money. At worst, they are Satanic and you are in severe Spiritual danger if you come under their influence and control.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Catholic Church has been a trusted asset of the US intelligence community for quite some time. Significant information obtained by priests during confessions is routinely passed on to the government.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This agreement predates the internet by many years. Because the church has branches in almost every country, it has great potential for covert activities. For example, if you need to get an operative who is in danger out of a country, they can go to a Catholic church for “confession”. Once the door is closed, they can exit through a secret passage, be disguised in robes and spirited safely out of the country. Church secrecy is at least on a par with US secrecy. Also, the Catholic church and the US shadow government share the same Satanic value system and engage in child rape and ritual killings.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Doctors and the Medical Industry</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Medicine in the United States is an industry. It is no longer a profession. Its corporate model puts profit above all else. If some patients accidentally benefit they are the lucky ones.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The medical community has a rigid hierarchical structure and effective mechanisms for enforcing secrecy. Essentially, its model closely resembles the military chain of command structure. This makes it a perfect partner for the government in the area of secret human experiments.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, when the government was doing radiation experiments on humans, a doctor or someone dressed as a doctor would just walk up to unsuspecting patients and inject them with radioactive material. They were then secretly followed for years to see what would happen. Eventually, some of those who survived were told the truth. Most people used in the MK Ultra and subsequent secret projects were never notified.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Hospitals are set up to protect themselves. Staff may appear to be dedicated, smiling people who truly care about you. However, they are basically prostitutes who are being nice because you are worth money to them. When they make mistakes they have a “loss prevention” department staffed by clever lawyers who are trained to protect the financial interests of the hospital by denying everything and fabricating believable coverups. They are trained to do whatever is necessary. The staff will all agree to support whatever lies are needed. They know their job and their financial future depends upon maintaining strict secrecy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The only people who receive legitimate medical care are the select elite cleared to access<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>. These people always get excellent care because the doctors work for the shadow government and mistakes on their part are simply not tolerated.</p>
<h4>Infiltrations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Countries which have the resources to sustain an intelligence community generally try to get operatives (spies) into other countries so they can directly observe activities. When real people gather intelligence, this is called <em>human intelligence </em>or HUMINT. The US, of course, does this too. However, you may not be aware of the extent to which the US also infiltrates itself. The central government really does not trust anyone.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Essentially all local police departments, state offices and state governors have a covert federal agent working close by pretending to be just another employee. Also, every US neighborhood has an informer who reports to the federal government. Large corporations, which tend to behave like “mini governments”, need to be infiltrated and kept under observation. Colleges and universities are also monitored.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Here is how this spy network operates: The NSA likes to recruit young kids right out of college. When they are hired and sworn to secrecy they still do not know what their assignment will be. They must agree to do this assignment without first being told what it is.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Some agents, like John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a>, are assigned to work in other countries. However, others are assigned to work inside the US. Their assignment could be to go to some state and apply to join the local police department. They would pretend to be just a regular person looking for a job. They would take the necessary training and spend their life as a local policeman so they could directly observe other local police from the inside and report to the NSA. Since they are actually an employee of the NSA, presumably they get to keep both salaries and, eventually, both retirements. All significant local police forces in the US are infiltrated this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Additionally, some agents will be assigned to get a job on the state governor’s staff as well as in major local state agencies. A CIA or NSA agent is always on the staff at major colleges and universities. The same goes for major corporations.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Senior level agents are allowed to have special TV receivers in their homes linked to the secret government TV network. This way everyone stays on the same page. The channels on this network actually broadcast the truth. TV channels available to ordinary people contain only government approved propaganda mixed with “bread and circuses” presentations to make sure the <em>sheeple </em>stay asleep and content.</p>
<h4>Fronts</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US government is involved in illegal activities internationally and domestically. If it performed these activities overtly in the name of the United States, there would be serious consequences under both international and local laws. To avoid this situation, the US government operates thousands of “front organizations” which appear to be private but are actually shadow operatives of the US.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">For example, John Perkins <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote2" name="fn2">[2]</a> explained that he was recruited, hired and trained by the NSA. He was an NSA agent. However, for his cover as an <em>economic hit man</em>, he “officially” worked for a “private” company called Charles T. Main. This company was a government front to shield the US because the activities the NSA trained Perkins to do were illegal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is standard operating procedure for the US as well as other countries and many corporations. It shields them from legal recourse by providing deniability for the crimes they actually direct and commit.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Generally, when the US wants to influence other sovereign countries, it creates harmless looking NGO’s which appear to be independent but are actually fronts for covert activities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Domestically, colleges and universities — especially those with associated medical schools and hospitals — are great places to conceal a variety of covert projects such as the MK Ultra series of human experiments which, reportedly, continue today using new cover names. The US also likes to create non-profit corporations which exist only to provide classified services to the United States. A good example would be the Institutes for Defense Analysis (IDA). The US, reportedly, is its only client.</p>
<h4>Programming</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Mass media “programming” is actually programming you. It has developed into a subtle form of mind control. Before radio and television, special interests recognized that motion pictures could be used to alter public opinion in their favor. Perhaps, for example, you wanted to attack labor unions. When radio and later television came along providing access to national and international audiences, the temptation to exploit these technologies became irresistible. Originally, the US government recognized this and set up fairness rules to prevent monopolies from taking over the broadcast media and blocking opposing viewpoints. All this ended, unfortunately, when Ronald Regan canceled all the fairness regulations. Today, a handful of powerful corporations own and control essentially all content delivered by radio and television.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Television is the main vehicle for mass indoctrination. It is said that people watching TV actually fall into a light hypnotic trance. The “entertainment” you see on TV does not “just happen to be there”. It is very carefully planned and timed to attract and influence targeted audiences. It is said that if some event were to somehow shut down all television broadcasts the government would experience a severe crisis because it would lose control over the minds of the masses.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">TV creates sort of a “hive mind” among the masses and keeps everyone coordinated and tuned into the official party line. Without this, people would have no choice but to start thinking for themselves and forming independent opinions. Clearly, this would be a disaster.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The radio broadcast of “War of the Worlds” and the later movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still” are said to be CIA psychological experiments to judge how the general public would react to some type of ET contact.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Today, broadcasting is not just a one way event. Because people react to events and use social media to express these reactions, the effect of specific propaganda can be analyzed in real time. Since the government now intercepts all electronic communications, it is able to see general opinions and then tweak algorithms to maximize the desired effect of propaganda. This ability makes TV a two-way communications system although most people, of course, do not realize this and have no concept of the level of sophistication these technologies have reached.</p>
<h4>Information Theory</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Information Theory is the name of a relatively new branch of science which became popular in the 1960′s. It covers a broad range of technologies. Basically, it is the science of the flow of information and how that flow can be selectively controlled so that information flows only in desired pathways. As you may have already guessed, governments love this sort of stuff.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>ECM</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">ECM stands for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">El</span>ectronic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Co</span>unter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me</span>asures. In general, these are techniques to disable other electronic devices. Basically, it is electronic warfare. When the secret service is active in an area, for example, they will selectively jam all radio frequencies except for the specific frequencies they are using so that no one else can communicate.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">World leaders, who are generally terrified of “threats” materializing from practically anywhere, like to travel with ECM generators running just in case “someone” from “somewhere” was trying to target them for “some reason”. Basically, they are paranoid whack jobs.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People familiar with aviation tell the story of how Tony Blair, while traveling to or near a commercial airport, reportedly caused a commercial jet to crash because all the ECM garbage he was transmitting jammed the plane’s navigation system. Of course, the British government would never admit this.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Secure Communication With Submarines</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7754" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-1.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="315" />Since submarines were invented, communicating with them has been a problem because conventional radio waves will not travel underwater. Therefore, early submarines had to get close enough to the surface to put up some kind of antenna in the air to send or receive radio messages. Obviously, this could pose a problem if you did not wish to be discovered and located. After all, the motivation to create submarines in the first place was the feeling that they would be able to move about the planet secretly. However, newer technologies now make this impossible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">To solve the problem of reliable secure communication without the need to surface, scientists learned that sea water was essentially transparent to a special type of Argon laser. To set up the current communications network, it was decided to use several satellites with each satellite sending only part of an encrypted communication signal. The complete signal could only be received at a specific point underwater where all the laser beams intersected. Intercepting only one or two beams would prove useless. This communications system is considered to be impossible to intercept.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Quantum Entanglement</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Returning to the submarine issue for a moment, before modern communications were perfected, there was a search for some reliable method to send a signal to a submerged submarine that could not be detected. This was considered necessary in a war situation to secretly transmit an attack command. What they originally did was to locate a couple of people who could communicate telepathically. One would be at the command base and the other on the submarine. Doing a bit more research, it was determined that this type of communication is instantaneous and somehow operated outside of time. Radio waves travel at the speed of light.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Quantum entanglement is a process which uses technology to send and receive signals outside of space-time. Now, why would you possibly want to do this? Well, if you had a base or a colony on a planet in some other solar system light years away, you would not want to wait years for messages to be received. Following this thread — and adding some basic common sense — why would you want to dedicate resources to search for habitable planets in distant solar systems when you had already “proven” it would be impossible to ever get there? Could it just be that someone is not coming clean with whole story?</p>
<h4>The Separation Barrier</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a model of the separation barrier which insulates the ruling class from the slave class. It is essentially “intellectual apartheid”. The question is, why is it there. It takes considerable effort, money and manpower to maintain this artificial barrier. What is the reasoning behind not having a level playing field for everyone? Why does this idea absolutely terrify the elite? What are they afraid of?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Pirate Story</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This is a summary of a story told years ago on a radio broadcast most likely by Paul Harvey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinary people were afraid. The Earth was flat so they dare not venture far from home. Periodically, a pirate ship would come. They did not know how it got there or from where it came. It brought treasures they had never seen. The Chief Pirate would encourage the young men to study and specialize in specific skills. He wanted them to become educated but only in one narrow area. The Chief Pirate knew the world was not flat and how to navigate to other lands. However, this knowledge was never discussed. This “top secret” knowledge or the “big picture of the known world” would only be given to the Chief Pirate’s son who would inherit his title and someday become the Chief Pirate.</p></blockquote>
<p style="color: #000000;">This story is about the origin of the concept we call <em>compartmentalization</em> — the process of controlling the slave masses by only allowing them to know specific bits of the truth while the leaders are allowed to know total truth.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Leaders can only maintain their status if there are slaves. Otherwise, everyone would be equal and operate on a level playing field. This means “leaders” would have to pull their own weight like everyone else. Clearly, this would be intolerable. Leaders love beautiful and exotic things but don’t want to do the work needed to create these things. They probably could not even plant a garden much less build the various “ivory towers” where they like to live surrounded by servants. If left on their own they would very likely starve. This is why it is so important to create and maintain the complex separation barrier.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Why don’t people who live above the separation barrier ever “come down” and talk to the people below the barrier? Well, other than the obvious fact that they would likely be killed or jailed for espionage or treason, there is another, simpler, reason.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Would you like to spend your days sitting in an open field with kindergarten kids looking for four leaf clovers? Probably not. You have progressed beyond that. The slaves below the separation barrier cannot even imagine the world of those who live above the barrier. In fact, the elite do not even consider the slaves human. They call them “disposable biological units”. The United Nations prefers the slang term “the herd”. Slaves can be easily bred in quantities needed and programmed to do desired tasks. Then, they can be easily disposed of when no longer useful. That’s how they look at you. So, why would they want to make friends with you?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Mars Example</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is an interesting event playing out today that you may have noticed. This concerns the recruitment and selection of people to be sent to Mars. There are simulation projects where volunteers are locked away to imitate the long voyage to Mars. They are being told that this is a one way trip and they can never hope to return to Earth.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What you are witnessing is the selection process for the “seed people” who will be used to breed the future slave class on Mars. In a situation similar to the period when most believed the Earth was flat and you would fall off if you tried to go to sea, these people are convinced that the only way to get to mars is to ride a rocket on a perilous journey taking years. Because they truly believe this, when they get to Mars, they will teach this crap to their kids along with other misconceptions like it is impossible to go faster than the speed of light and other associated obsolete scientific principles. They will have no<br />
desire to ever return to Earth or go anywhere else because they truly believe it is not possible. They will be contented slaves.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course the truth is that there are already secret colonies on Mars. It is not that hard to get there using antigravity and other secret propulsion methods and it is quite likely possible to simply walk through some kind of wormhole device and come out on Mars.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, the slaves will never know this. Just as it is done on Earth, there will be an artificial separation barrier. The insiders will know the truth and will be physically hidden from the slaves. There will be secret police and other methods — the same as are used on Earth — to make sure no slave ever escapes from the “information prison”. Business as usual will continue.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Reinforcement of Ignorance</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Governments and their oligarchs love to keep their subjects in a cloud of ignorance. Back in the days when people believed the Earth was flat, the inner circle ruling class knew it was round. Maintaining the deception was convenient because it kept the slaves from developing any desire to travel far from home.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Nothing has changed all that much today. Consider, for example, all the fuss over the missing MH370 plane. You are being played for a sucker. It is impossible for that plane to have “disappeared”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The US DoD spy satellite system reportedly consists of ten constellations of satellites. Each constellation has over seven thousand satellites. They see and record everything that happens on this planet. The floor of the oceans can be seen just as clearly as the land areas. The resolution of the system is better than one square millimeter. Also, everything is recorded so you can go back in time and play past images.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7756" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-2.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="141" />This is a picture of a common electric lamp. Take this lamp and throw it in the ocean — any ocean anywhere on this planet. The spy satellite system will locate it, give you the coordinates and give you a photo at least as good as the one above. That is the capability of the system. So, clearly, it is impossible not to know the location of something as large as a Boeing 777 plane. All the TV publicity is a choreographed play. You are being scammed and you need to wake up and realize this fact.</p>
<h4>Murders and Assassinations</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">To ensure a strong empire, dissent must be crushed. The United States trains assassins and carries out both domestic and foreign murders and assassinations on a regular basis. You may be familiar with the classic movie scenes where a black limousine with tinted windows drives by a target with thugs shooting machine guns. Although this would accomplish the task, it is a bit too obvious in a country that advertises itself to be a free, civilized democracy. Someone might catch on and begin to doubt the party line. Consequently, these things must be done quietly.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Inside the US, murders are reportedly carried out by a group known as “FBI Division Five”. Other agencies likely have the responsibility for foreign assassinations. However, the basic techniques used would be similar.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Typically, an agent would wake up every day and connect to the top secret internet to see who he was assigned to kill that day. There would be several options. If it was important to eliminate the target immediately, a fast acting chemical agent would be selected which, for example, would cause the target to die within a few hours of a “natural” heart attack.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">However, if time was not critical and the government just wanted the target out of the way, you might want to select one of the cancer causing agents such as those likely used to eliminate Hugo Chavez and Senator Ted Kennedy.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is also a third possibility. This involves character assassination instead of actual murder. Consider, for example, a person who has gained a lot of public recognition talking about, say, free energy. If you simply kill the person, there could be blowback and talk that he was silenced by the government. In such cases, it is easier to use a chemical agent designed not to kill but, rather, to cause states of mental confusion resulting in obviously strange behavior. This would be coordinated with the government controlled mainstream press to make sure everyone became convinced the person was a nut and would therefore ignore anything said without regard to the truth or validity of the message.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Once the appropriate chemical has been selected, you need to load it into the secret delivery system and locate your target. To find your target you will connect to the top secret internet and pinpoint the location of the target through their cell phone. You can also activate all the cameras and microphones in electronic gadgets connected to the internet associated with the target in case you wish to look around the target’s home and hear in real time what is taking place.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Of course, this will not help you locate the target when it is time to actually do the hit. So, you need to get the top secret profile data which will show any predictable habits of the target. Everyone is constantly tracked through their cell phones and profiles are logged and stored. In this case, the profile shows that the target has a favorite restaurant and goes there for lunch every day around 11:30. Now, you know exactly what to do. You go to the restaurant, hang out until you see your target, and get in line behind the target. Now, all you need to do is slightly bump into the target to deliver the chemical. Generally, the targets never even notice.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">This mission is now complete. If it is early enough, you can check back in to the top secret system to see who you are supposed to kill next. Just another day. Just a routine job.</p>
<h4>Money</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;"><em>Money</em> is an imaginary force. It is used to motivate and control slaves. Real forces effect all life forms. However, only people respond to money. The only reason they do is because they have been artificially programmed to do so.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money can be created in unlimited quantities by those adept in the use of this force. The physical world is finite, however the world of imagination is not. There is no limit to the quantity of money that can be imagined into existence. Money can also be imagined out of existence.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Let’s assume that one day the entire financial system simply disappeared. If you lived in a rural area and had a nice veggie garden, some friendly chickens, collection facilities for rain water and a few photocells for electricity, you would not notice this. The veggies would continue to grow. Rain would periodically fall. The chickens would lay eggs as usual. The sun would continue to shine. However, if you lived in a city environment, you would be devastated.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Before money, people lived in small hunter-gatherer groups. The concept of ownership did not exist. People worked and survived as a group. Men and women were equal. Everyone contributed to the community. Resources were shared equally. The concept of “mine” and “yours” did not exist. Women generally became pregnant only once about every three years although there was no birth control. Later, when the concept of money entered the consciousness, women were seen as having less value because men were paid for work but women were not paid to raise and care for kids. Society has changed, however, the downgraded status of women has not.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Money systems have always been manipulated by clever people. When gold was used as money, people learned they could dilute pure gold with silver or maybe even lead to come up with something that looked like pure gold and had the correct weight but was a fraud. A king suspected he was being scammed but had no way to prove it. He called on the great minds of the time for help. This led to what is known as the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://faculty.weber.edu/ewalker/Chem2990/Chem%202990%20Specific%20Gravity%20Readings.pdf" target="_blank">Archimedes’ principle</a> which is better known today as “specific gravity”. This principle made it possible to compare a sample known to be pure gold to a questionable sample and prove the unknown sample was not pure gold. Likely, some clever crook lost his head once this test became known.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">There is a general belief that gold is the ultimate reference for all money. However, secrets concerning the exact quantity of gold make this a perilous assumption. Reportedly, the United States stole a tremendous quantity of physical gold from Japan towards the end of World War II. This gold exists off the books. To make matters worse, Japan was not all that concerned. Japan had been using gold bars as ballast on its ships because they were compact and heavy. They thought nothing of throwing the bars overboard as necessary. Japan used platinum as a money reference and the US never got that. This should make one rethink all the hype about the value of gold. It may be a lot more plentiful than we have been led to believe. Also, the secret off the books stashes of gold would allow its relative value to be manipulated at will just like other commodity markets.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Financial Axis of Evil <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote3" name="fn3">[3]</a></strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7755" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/standard-procedure-3.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="231" />This is the model of the financial axis of evil which rules this planet. It consists of three main branches as shown above. Collectively, they are known as “The Empire of the City”. Briefly, here is how this system operates:</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The London financial district is in London, Washington D.C. is in the United States and the Vatican is in Italy. However, these three places are not part of the countries where they exist. They are independent “city states” and have their own laws and constitution. They are, effectively, “mini countries” inside of other countries and fly their own flags. The city state of London is a private corporation and pays no taxes to actual London or to Britain. The city state of London is the master power center and is controlled by the <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm" target="_blank">Rothschild family</a> which considers itself to be the legal owner of this planet. The Vatican is the largest private land owner in the world and the first true multinational corporation with installations (churches) and secret agents (The Knights of Malta) everywhere. They control through the power of fear of the unknown and practice black magic. Washington D.C. relies upon brute military force. All three closely cooperate combining their specialties of financial trickery, witchcraft and military might. Of course, all three worship Satan as their Master.</p>
<h4>Slavery</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">Slavery is alive and well throughout the world. The US constitution prohibits slavery, however, most americans live in slave-like conditions.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">It is said that it will take the average college student until age fifty to pay back their student loan.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery addressed the concept of physically owning another person. However, it did not address the issue of holding another person in bondage as a debt slave. It also did not consider the concept of private for profit prisons who force inmates to work as slaves. These systems exist today and are perfectly legal.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Actually, a recent report from prestigious Princeton University has reclassified the US government as an oligarchy — a country run by and for the rich elite. Former US President Carter has stated that the United States “no longer has a functioning democracy”. So much for the Founding Father’s dream. Speaking of dreams, check out the free you tube video titled “The American Dream”.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Other forms of slavery are illegal but still flourish. Sex slaves are always in demand. Traffickers are sometimes caught but you need to realize that your leaders use sex slaves and also routinely abuse young girls and boys. Sometimes they are also killed during occult rituals. No one ever talks about this and these people are never punished. This has been the normal way of life for Satan worshipers for many years and nothing has changed or is likely to ever change in the future. Stanley Kubrick’s last movie, <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>, covers this subject. Some believe this intense dramatization of how the elite really live may have cost him his life.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">People still have some rights left in the United States but other countries are a different story. Qatar is doing construction for the World Cup. The event is not scheduled until the year 2022, however they have <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/2022-world-cup-qatar-accused-3303458" target="_blank">already killed 1200 slaves</a> <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/standard-procedure/#footnote7" name="fn7">[7]</a> by working them to death. People are lured from poor countries with the promise of jobs and money. When they arrive, their passports are confiscated and they are forced to work until they literally drop dead. If the World Cup is actually held in Qatar in 2022, there will be glamorous TV coverage and no one will remember or care about all the dead slaves. The show must go on.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Qatar, incidentally, sponsors Al Jazeera TV network.</p>
<h4>Adaptation Techniques</h4>
<p style="color: #000000;">The status quo of today will never change because the people who created it will never die. Because of <a style="color: #003366;" href="http://wariscrime.com/new/top-secret-medicine/" target="_blank">top secret medicine</a>, when men like Henry Kissinger, who heads the Bilderberg Group’s steering committee, get too feeble to function, they will simply go to one of the secret locations and use the temporal reversal device to regress back to about twenty years old. Their memories will be unaffected. Then they will get new identities and continue on. This process can be repeated indefinitely.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Because you can never change the status quo, your best hope for a lifetime of reasonable quality is to find clever ways to live in this world with as much independence as possible.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">One method of adaptation is autonomous and semi-autonomous communities. If the community is registered as a religious institution it is automatically shielded from most government interference by the US constitution. It pays no taxes and can pretty much write its own rules by simply calling whatever it wants to do “religious doctrine”. Many small semi-autonomous groups exist where people who share a common set of values find ways to quietly live out their lives pretty much on their own terms. The government does not seem interested in bothering these smaller groups as long as they live peacefully and are not doing anything that the government perceives to be a threat.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Amish people are a good example of an autonomous group. You would probably not want to live as they do, however, before you completely dismiss them, you may want to look at some definite advantages in their chosen lifestyle.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Remember, these are the people who reject technology. They just might have made the correct choice. Technology, at first, seemed like a good idea. However, now that people are addicted to technology they are also enslaved by technology. Everything they do is monitored and recorded by the government. Privacy no longer exists. It did not have to be this way.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Technology, in itself, is not evil. However, it can be quite evil if you live under a government run by sociopathic control freaks which, unfortunately, you do. In the Amish world, electronic surveillance does not exist because electronic devices do not exist. The constant propaganda from TV has no effect on people who do not have TV. A horse does not report its position to a GPS satellite and is not controlled by a computer.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Also, the people are generally healthy and do not suffer from many diseases common to the mainstream population. They are not being poisoned by fluorinated water or additives found in processed food because they don’t use these things. Also, they get lots of physical exercise.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Without totally withdrawing from the world, there are some positive steps you can take. By now you know never to drink fluorinated water or use any personal product containing fluoride such as many brands of toothpaste. To minimize harmful food additives, look for Kosher food which is marked with either the encircled “K” or “U” (Ultra Kosher). These foods have less or no harmful additives. The Jewish community is very protective of its people and the Mossad is widely considered to be the best intelligence service in the world. Therefore, they would have the inside scoop on everything including food and do not want to see their people harmed.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Whatever you decide to do, you definitely do not want to be part of so called mainstream society. These people are doomed. They are sheep (<em>sheeple</em>) slowly walking to the slaughter house. Don’t go there!</p>

<p>In &#8220;<em>The attack on biblical creation in UK schools continues</em>,&#8221; Phil Robinson reports that in the dechristianized U.K. unrelenting attacks against special creation (Genesis account) display a level of aggressive intolerance that is hard to stomach, coming as they do from self-proclaimed scientifically-enlightened ‘voices of reason.’  Some schools have already banned the teaching of special creation in favor of evolutionary science.   (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreation.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz2TTlNCM3Mti6nKV5HZ7qM-W5oQ">creation.com</a>, Mar. 9, 2014)</p>
<p>Other shrill &#8216;voices of reason&#8217; go so far as to connect special creation to mental illness and child abuse. During a radio interview in Australia famous physicist and atheist propagandist Lawrence Krauss said that while in the United States recently, he stated that &#8220;<em>teaching creationism is child abuse and I think it is.&#8221; </em>(Prayer News, a publication of Creation Ministries, Apr. 2014)</p>
<p>Throughout the West and here in America a slash-and-burn operation conducted against the Genesis account, particularly its&#8217; literal and historical elements, is justified by the false idea that evolution is science, thus intolerance of special creation is often presented as a ‘science versus religion’ or ‘faith versus reason’ issue.   So successful has this war of attrition been that younger generations of Westerners and Americans have been disconnected from both Western history and its’ founding Christian-based worldview, thus like seedlings recently popped up from the soil are unconcerned that special creation, where the ultimate source of life, being and unalienable rights are found, has nearly been displaced by anti-human pagan conceptions positing billions of years of evolutionary transformism from lower kinds of things to higher and higher kinds of things&#8212; even non-human kinds of things:</p>
<p><em>“For us, the best way to create new (‘artificial’) life forms and intelligence is to allow them to emerge through evolution, as nature does, only in much shorter timeframes and with much greater efficiency and variety.”</em></p>
<p><em><br />
“For conscious evolution to be successful, we need to observe and understand the actual workings of nature, in all its dynamism, to the point of profound reverence, or ‘worship.’ This is what I call extreme nature-worshipping… From the perspective of extreme nature-worshipping, the real significance of Darwin’s evolutionary theory is not that humans descended from lower species, but that we can continue to evolve.”</em>(Cosmic Beings: Transhumanist Deism in Ted Chu’s Cosmic View, Institute for Ethics &amp; Emerging Technology, Giulio Prisco)</p>
<p>The vicious name-calling, seething resentment toward and censorship of the six day creation account and of all who profess and teach it should raise the eyebrows of any rational thinking person.  If evolution really is a fact of science then why the irrational name-calling, ridicule, scorn, shunning, resentment, intolerance and demonization?</p>
<p>The answer is that the zealous worshipper of evolution is the Spirit of our age that emerged out of the Renaissance whose answer to the Lord Jesus Christ is the Cross (crucify Him) and whose fulfillment will be the Wicked One. (2 Thess. 2:1-8)</p>
<p>From the Renaissance to our own time the Spirit has been transgressing, blaspheming, and departing that it need not obey His voice.   Like a dog returning to its own vomit, the Spirit has returned to its first love: the cult of demons in the Godless universe of matter, psychic energy, and animated forces where time is changed, past history rendered meaningless, and the liberated Spirit imbibes the cup of wrath, an intoxicating mixture of Babylonian Mysteries, incantations, spiritism, Gnosticism, sorcery, witchcraft, Hermetic magic, Kabbalah, reincarnation, astrology, and other devilish occult traditions.</p>
<p>The Book of Revelation pinpoints Babylon as the post-flood center of an occult pagan Mystery religion based on advaitic monism, science of magic transformism, exalted priesthood, gnosis, secret initiations, psychic-powers, familiar spirits, androgyny, sexual perversions, and other evils.</p>
<p>Babylon embraced the Great Lie. Its inhabitants claimed the title, &#8220;I AM.&#8221; The root source of this evil religion and its occult power was the Great Dragon himself&#8230;.Lucifer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;. <em>the Great Lie </em>(is) <em>the foundation stone of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sufism, Jainism, Sikhism, Taoism, the Kabala, the Greek Hermetic, Eleusinian and Gnostic beliefs, Neo-Platonism, all the occult creeds from Theosophy and the Masonic orders to the Rosicrucian&#8217;s (and) the New Age movement. The Great Lie is&#8230;the belief that man is God, that his true identity is the immortal self&#8230;that as God, he will never die </em>(and) <em>Sin and depravity are&#8230;illusions since this inner divinity is at man&#8217;s core.&#8221;</em> (The Great Lie, Tal Brooke, SCP Journal, Vol. 29:2-29:3, 2005)</p>
<p>Though the Spirit of our age claims the title “I AM” it nevertheless follows after and falls down before other fascinating men: theoreticians of evolutionary science, nature philosophy and evolutionary pagan theology. These charismatic Pied Pipers are possessed of surpassing powers of persuasion and inflexible determination of will to which the Spirit assigns more honor than to anything else.</p>
<p>The Spirit has usurped the throne of the Word Incarnate (John 1:1) because He is not good, not just or benevolent but a devil, an evil Tyrant Who, with His infliction of suffering in this life and eternal punishment in the next must be deposed. (Psalm 2:2-3)</p>
<p>Blaming our Lord for their own sins the proud, self-righteous Spirit of rebellion, hypocrisy and negation says to Him, “…<em>you are not my father</em>.”  My father is the god of forces, therefore:<br />
<em><br />
&#8220;I am I, I come out of myself, and in choice and action I make myself.&#8221;</em> (Daniel Bell, quoted by Herbert Schlossberg in &#8220;Idols for Destruction,&#8221; p. 43)</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the Spirit of our age is the “<em>striving human will</em>” seeking desperately to launch itself,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;into minor godhood in an evolving cosmos through the mechanisms of directed spiritual evolution, spiritualized science and spirit contact</em>.&#8221; The &#8216;new&#8217; spirituality now presents itself as the <em>&#8220;rightful replacement for the Revealed Word </em>(and)<em> proclaims its spiritual liberation from the worldview that informs Christianity and its freedom from </em>(the)<em> personal and wholly other God.  But this new way of self-salvation</em> (is)<em> little more than the refurbishing of an ancient spiritual mistake</em>.&#8221;  (The Making of the New Spirituality: the Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 279)</p>
<p><strong>“As it was in the days of Noah…” </strong></p>
<p>The ominous signs of this age are obvious, said the English theologian G.H. Pember (1837-1910) in his book, &#8220;<em>The Antichrist Babylon and the Coming Kingdom</em>.&#8221;  Just as it was during the pre-flood generations, open intercourse with demons (spiritism) is now common throughout Christendom and even in Russia.   In France it is the national pastime.   The apostles of the powers of darkness are everywhere proclaiming their scientific and evolutionary theories demonstrating that the world created itself and had no need of a Creator (p. 60) while the miseries which have resulted from sin,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em>are blasphemously charged upon the Almighty, Who so loved the world as to give His son for it </em>(but is now)<em> impiously forbidden to curb and discipline the rebels who owe their existence to the breath of His mouth.  And when we see such men as John Stuart Mill </em>(and) <em>John Morley, the late Chief Secretary for Ireland&#8230;guiding their fellows to defiant insubordination, we can scarcely wonder that Bradlaugh&#8230;said, ‘This world might have been happy, had not the shadow of God fallen upon it.</em>” (pp. 35-36, 1888)</p>
<p><strong>Rise of Occult Evolutionary Science </strong></p>
<p>In the impeccably researched, &#8220;<em>The Making of the New Spirituality</em>,&#8221; James Herrick observes that the scientific tradition in Renaissance Europe developed around three basic approaches: the organic, the mechanical and the magical.   It was magical and/or occult science that provided the greatest impetus for scientific exploration. (p. 45)</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis underscores this point in “<em>The Abolition of Man</em>:”</p>
<p>“<em>You will even find people who write about the sixteenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know better. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse. I allow that some (certainly not all) of the early scientists were actuated by a pure love of knowledge. But if we consider the temper of that age as a whole we can discern the impulse of which I speak.”</em></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>God and the Knowledge of Reality</em>,&#8221; the Catholic philosopher and historian, Thomas Molnar (1921–2010), reveals the &#8216;temper of that age&#8217; as a spirit of rebellion against the Christian God, and this is why occult science and evolutionary thinking provided the greatest impetus. During the Renaissance, certain Christian theologians, mystics and scholars such as Emanuel Swedenborg had discovered Hermetic magic and occult Jewish Kabbalah texts which they studied and translated resulting in Hermetic Kabbalah. Then like Pico della Mirandola, they argued that occult hermetic science – the divine technology or Magic Way of reaching divine status and powers through ritual procedures (spiritual evolution) is the best proof of the divinity of Christ. In other words said Molnar,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;..by the time of the Renaissance the esoteric texts of the first centuries A.D. had acquired in scholarly and humanist circles an unparalleled prestige, confronting as equals the texts held sacred by the church. In Pico&#8217;s estimation, &#8216;nulla est scientia que nos magis certificet de divinitate Christ quam magia et Cabala&#8217; (there is no science that would prove for us Christ&#8217;s divinity better than magic and the Cabala.)&#8221; </em>(pp. 78-79)</p>
<p>Hermetic magic and Jewish Kabbalah are ancient Mystery Religion traditions, as affirmed by G. H. Pember in his classic work, &#8220;<em>Earth&#8217;s Earliest Ages.&#8221;   </em>Pember thoroughly examines the role of fallen angels in connection with the magic (occult transformism) they taught to pre-flood generations and compares them to the explosion of spiritism (open intercourse with evil spirits), astrology, the Mysteries and other occult traditions sweeping over Christendom.</p>
<p>Pember writes that the Mysteries are no longer veiled in mystery but boldly presented by the powerful occult brotherhood that emerged out of the Renaissance as the fruit of modern science, especially evolutionary philosophy, which the brotherhood assert was included in the instructions given,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em>to the initiates of the Hermetic, Orphic, Eleusinian, and Cabbalistic mysteries, and were familiar to Chaldean Magi, Egyptian Priests, Hindu Occultists, Essenes, Therapeutae Gnostics, and Theurgic Neo-Platonists</em>.&#8221; (Pember, pp.243-244)</p>
<p><strong>Hermetic Magic<br />
</strong><br />
Hermeticism is an ancient Egyptian secret magic tradition based on a set of fourteen books known</p>
<p>collectively as the Corpus Hermeticum attributed to a mysterious figure known as Hermes Trismegistus. Implied in Hermeticism is an evolutionary process of magical transformism (spiritual evolution) moving from one kind of lower thing to another kind of higher thing:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Human beings are themselves the product of a long spiritual evolutionary process that moves from &#8216;creeping things&#8217; to fish, mammals, birds and then people.  Humans can&#8212;through occult knowledge and extraordinary ability&#8212;continue this evolutionary process and become daemons, then gods, and finally planets or stars</em>.&#8221; (The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition, James A. Herrick, p. 40)</p>
<p>With respect to Hermes identity, researchers of antiquity are divided.  Some believe Hermes was a mythical figure.  Others argue he was Ham or his son Cush.  The historian Samuel Shuckford argues that Hermes was Pathrusim, king of Thebais, the son of Mizraim, the son of Ham.   His Egyptian name was Tyoth or Thoth.  (The Sacred and Profane History of the World Connected, 1808)</p>
<p>In any case, it was Thoth-Hermes who instructed his brothers in the arts and science magic of alchemy or transmutation of a lower kind of thing into a higher kind of thing. For example, after a lengthy transformative process out of the eternally existing divine abyss (primordial matter), the self-created Sun-God Ra boasted that he “<em>came into being from primordial matter.”  </em>He made all the forms under which he<em> “appeared by means of the god-soul” </em>which he raised up out of Nu, primordial matter. (The Long War Against God, Dr. Henry Morris, p. 243)</p>
<p><strong>Occult Kabalah</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Kabalah is the key to the occult sciences; and the Gnostics were born of the Kabalists</em>.” (Occult Mason Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 626)</p>
<p>Like its’ Hermetic counterpart, Kabala implies a process of evolutionary transformism:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;the older Enoch book </em>(gives) <em>a fuller insight into the &#8220;Merkabah&#8221; and &#8220;Bereshit&#8221; lore of the ancients than the &#8220;Hekalot,&#8221; which present but fragments, while the central figure of the Cabala, Meṭaṭron-Enoch, is seen in ch. lxx.-lxxi. in a process of transformation</em>.” (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Helena Blavatsky, one of the key architects of Luciferian New Age pantheism, Kabalah derived,</p>
<p>“&#8230;.<em> from the older secret doctrines concerning divine things and cosmogony, which were combined into a theology after the time of the captivity of the Jews in Babylon. All the works that fall under the esoteric category are termed Kabalistic.” </em>(Blavatsky, Theosophical Glossary, p. 168)</p>
<p>The godless cosmogony of Kabala teaches the gradual condensation or evolutionary progression of a primal substance into visible matter.  This is a fundamental,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<em> doctrine of the Cabala </em>(and<em>) is the ancient Semitic conception of the ‘primal ocean,’ known to the Babylonians as ‘Apsu’ and called by the Gnostics βύθος =</em>  (Anz, ‘Die Frage nach dem Ursprung des Gnostizismus,’ p. 98).</p>
<p>The Chaldean occult science and pagan Mystery Religion was embraced by apostate Jews during their captivity in Babylon and delivered to subsequent generations of initiates by word of mouth. According to Blavatsky, these initiates of the Chaldean tradition in the centuries before Christ were known as Tanaim:<br />
<em>“The kabalist is a student of ‘secret science’, one who interprets the hidden meaning of the</em></p>
<p><em>Scriptures with the help of the symbolical Kabala… The Tanaim were the first kabalists among the Jews; they appeared at Jerusalem about the beginning of the third century before the Christian era… This secret doctrine is identical with the Persian wisdom, or ‘magic’</em>.” (Ibid. p.167)</p>
<p>The Essenes were also associated with the Kabala. The Jewish Encyclopedia describes the cabalistic practices of the Essenes, which were Judaized elements of Eastern mystical traditions:</p>
<p>“<em>So, too, were the Essenes familiar with the idea of the journey to heaven…and they were also masters of angelology. The practice of magic and incantation, the angelology and demonology, were borrowed from Babylonia, Persia, and Egypt; but these foreign elements were Judaized in the process, and took the form of the mystical adoration of the name of God and of speculations regarding the mysterious power of the Hebrew alphabet …, ‘the name of God creates and destroys worlds’, to become, finally, foundations of the philosophy of the ‘Sefer Yetzirah</em>.&#8221;  (Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p>According to Blavatsky the Essenes were pagan priests of the Greek goddess, Diana of Ephesus, where the Tanaim had established a college for instruction in the Chaldean mystery religion:</p>
<p>“<em>Essenes&#8230; had many Buddhistic ideas and practices; and it is noteworthy that the priests of the Great Mother at Ephesus, Diana-Bhavani with many breasts, were also denominated&#8230; It was at Ephesus where was the great College of the Essenes and all the lore the Tanaim had brought from the Chaldees&#8230; Essenes, believed in reincarnation</em>.” (Theosophical Glossary, pp. 113-14; The Secret Doctrine, Vol. II, p. 111n)</p>
<p>Eventually Alexandria, Egypt became the epicenter of cosmological and pagan religious ideas as well as the intellectual meeting point between Greek Mystery Religion/Hermetic magic initiates and nature sages and guardians of Kabala.  After the fall of Jerusalem, Alexandria was the center from which occult pagan Jews would disguise their mystery tradition in Christian terminology and attempt to penetrate the fledgling Church with heresy.</p>
<p>One of the primary tactics employed by Cabbalist pagan Jews for this purpose is the same one employed by their modern evolutionary Gnostic pagan counterparts.   It involves the reduction of the Genesis account, particularly the first three books, to allegory and myth, a ploy that eliminates the physical Adam from which all people descended and the sin that he transferred to the rest of the human race. This strikes directly at the heart of the Gospel: the need for the ‘last Adam’ to provide for us an escape from the wrath of God against sin incurred by the first Adam.  In this way, not only is the work of Christ on the cross rendered superfluous, meaning the heart of the faith is ripped out, but God is made responsible for sin and evil. (1 Peter 3:18-22; 1 John 2:22)</p>
<p>Long ago, the teachings of some of the early Church Fathers regarding the apostasy toward the end of the church age predicted the reappearance of this evil tactic. The fathers categorized it a Gnostic pagan heresy.</p>
<p>In <em>&#8220;Heresies 6.10&#8243;</em> Hippolytus writes that the Gnostic pagan Simon Magus feigned faith and allegorized much of Scripture, especially Genesis, to support his evolutionary Hermetic and Gnostic occult pantheist teachings.   Church Fathers Ireneaus, Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria reveal that Gnostic cult leader Marcion rejected the Old Testament, taught that the God of the Old Testament and his prophets are evil, made God the author of sin and removed all references that Christ was Creator (John 1:1)   (Ireneaus, &#8220;Against Heresies 1.26, 5.1,&#8221; Tertullian &#8220;Against Marcion 2.17,&#8221; Clement of Alexandria, &#8220;Against Heresies 4.29)</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Babylonian Mystery Religion is the mother of evolutionary Cabala, Gnosticism and all other occult pagan traditions:</p>
<p><em>“&#8230;.especially does Gnosticism testify to the antiquity of the Cabala. Of Chaldean origin&#8230; Gnosticism was Jewish in character long before it became Christian&#8230; Gnosticism—that is, the cabalistic ‘Hokmah’ (wisdom)—seems to have been the first attempt on the part of the Jewish sages to give the empirical mystic lore, with the help of Platonic and Pythagorean or Stoic ideas, a speculative turn; hence the danger of heresy…of which the systems of Philo, an adept in Cabala&#8230;show many pitfalls&#8230;Jewish gnosticism unquestionably antedates Christianity, for Biblical exegesis had already reached an age of five hundred years by the first century C.E.  Judaism had been in close contact with Babylonian-Persian ideas for at least that length of time, and for nearly as long a period with Hellenistic ideas. Magic, also, which,&#8230;was a not unimportant part of the doctrines and manifestations of gnosticism, largely occupied Jewish thinkers. There is, in general, no circle of ideas to which elements of gnosticism have been traced, and with which the Jews were not acquainted.”  </em>(Cabala, Jewish Encyclopedia)</p>
<p><strong>Building  the New Tower of Babylon</strong></p>
<p>In the essay,<em> “The Paganization of Biblical Studies</em>,” Dr. Peter Jones, director of truthxchange and adjunct professor of Westminster Seminary CA., writes that the books of the evolutionary Gnostic pagan Presbyterian heretic Lloyd Geering, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University, are promoted by the most powerful element of the Spirit of our age—the international occult New Age Luciferian elite-pagans&#8212;as programmatic templates for the future utopian pagan community from the point of view of Christian apostasy and socialism undergirded by evolutionary pantheist orthodoxy.</p>
<p>According to Geering, the world&#8217;s future culture will be post-Christian, global, religiously pagan and evolutionary.  This agenda is remarkably similar to that of Teilhard de Chardins’ disciple, the ex-Roman Catholic Thomas Berry in his book, <em>&#8220;The Great Work</em>&#8221; which is also being implemented through texts of the UN&#8217;s global programs.</p>
<p>The rising New World Order will be post-Christian because evolution proves that human beings, as they evolved out of primordial matter, created language, then symbols, then religious explanations and God Himself.  Therefore tomorrow&#8217;s culture will be pluralistic, syncretistic, relativistic and poly-gendered because evolution integrates all scientific, cultural, religious, economic and human gender into one worldwide anthill thus when the global society emerges from the evolutionary process,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;…it will require humanity to develop a new consciousness and a new form of spirituality</em>&#8221; because <em>&#8220;the new story which has become basic to the global world begins with a new word or idea&#8230;evolution.” </em>(ibid, Jones)</p>
<p>Like its’ mother, Mystery Babylon, the scientifically-enlightened ‘new&#8217; global religion of evolutionary transformism is occult pantheist advaita monism, which means that as an ancient impersonal god-force is within the cosmos, earth, human beings, rats, weeds, tumble bugs, cancer and everything else then all things are essentially &#8216;one.&#8217;  Since the god-force is within all things it is within the demonically &#8216;illumined&#8217; consciousness of every spiritually evolved initiate and adept.</p>
<p>This being the case, by means of trance states, brain-altering drugs, transcendental meditation, visualization, channeling, Zen Buddhism, Kundalini yoga, tantra, and other occult ways, the initiate can channel the god-force within thereby becoming a little god who controls matter because he controls mind. The physical world then, is an illusion because reality is inside the divine mind of the god-man.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is captured by Orwell in his book, “<em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>” in which negation of the physical world is an integral part of the social and political philosophy of Big Brother and his despotic Party. At one stage in the book, Winston stumbles upon the shocking realization that in the end the Party would announce that two plus two made five because the logic of Big Brothers’ position required it since the existence of external reality was denied by his philosophy.  Thus when the Thought Police agent O’Brien tortures Winston for politically incorrect “wrong thought” he states,</p>
<p><em>“We control matter because we control the mind.  Reality is inside the skull.  You will learn by degrees, Winston.  There is nothing that we could not do.  Invisibility, levitation&#8212;anything.  I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to….You must get rid of these nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature.  We make the laws of Nature.” </em>(Orwell, “The New Spirituality and its Hallmarks, Alan Morrison, SCP Journal, Vol. 30:4-31:1, 2007, p. 19)</p>
<p><strong>Evolving Toward Catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>In &#8220;<em>The Aquarian Conspiracy</em>,&#8221; a book that has been called &#8216;the New Age Bible,&#8217; Marilyn Ferguson (1938-2008) admits that the ‘new age’ evolutionary pantheism and occult technologies being employed throughout America were at one time the private domain of ancient initiates.   In fact, as Constance Cumbey reveals in her thoroughly researched book, <em>&#8220;The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow,&#8221;</em> many New Age historians claim their occult religion and techniques originated in Atlantis and afterward were preserved in the ancient land of Babylon,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;and surrounding Plains of Shinar and from there disseminated throughout the earth, including Taoist doctrines of China, Mayan-Aztec teachings of Mexico and Central/South America; Great Spirit teachings of the American Indians, Hindu/Buddhist teachings of Asia, etc.&#8221; </em>(pp. 250-251)</p>
<p>After the Flood, said Shuckford, while the faithful Noah remained in the East and established the worship of the true God, eighty years after the Flood his rebellious son Ham and his sons together with other family members departed and eventually settled in the plains of Shinar where they resolved to build a tower, a monument to their own pride, vanity, ambition and rebellion against God. (ibid, p.94)</p>
<p>It was Noah’s son Ham, according to ancient Church Father Clement, who  ‘preserved’ and revived the Mystery Religion of ‘Atlantis’ and its attendant evils:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Fallen angels taught men the use of magical incantations that would force demons to obey man. After the flood Ham the son of Noah&#8230;discovered this and taught it to his sons.  This became ingrained into the Egyptians, Persians, and Babylonians.  Ham died shortly after the fall of the Tower of Babel.  Nimrod, called Ninus by the Greeks, was handed this knowledge and by it caused men to go away from the worship of God and go into diverse and erratic superstitions and they began to be governed by the signs in the stars and motions of the planets</em>.&#8221; (Recognitions of Clement 4.26-29)</p>
<p>In his well-researched book, &#8220;<em>Ancient Post-Flood History</em>,&#8221; Ken Johnson, Th.D., reports that the sons of Ham persuaded the people to accept that the true God was merely an impersonal creative force within all of nature, making man the highest form of life/god.  Through the power of persuasion, Ham and his sons revived magical evolutionary transformism, pantheism and idolatry. (pp. 47-48)</p>
<p>Eventually Ham was deified and worshipped by later pagans as the gods Cronus and Jupiter:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ham is represented by many writers as a very wicked, immodest, and profligate creature: Berosus (i) makes him a magician, and to be the same with Zoroast or Zoroastres, and speaks of him as the public corrupter of mankind; and says that he taught men to live as before the flood, to lie with mothers, sisters, daughters, males and brutes, and creatures of all sorts; and that he actually did so himself, and therefore was cast out by his father Janus, or Noah, and got the name of &#8220;Chem&#8221;, the infamous and immodest&#8230;&#8221; Upon seeing his father&#8217;s nakedness Ham,  &#8220;told his two brethren without; he went out of the tent after he had pleased himself with the sight&#8230; and in a wanton, ludicrous, and scoffing manner, related what he had seen: some of the Jewish Rabbins (k), as Jarchi relates, say that Canaan first saw it, and told his father of it; and some say (l), that he or Ham committed an unnatural crime with him; and others (m), that he castrated him; and hence, it is supposed, came the stories of Jupiter castrating his father Saturn, and Chronus his father Uranus.&#8221; </em>   Genesis 9:22 Gill&#8217;s Exposition</p>
<p>History did not begin after billions of years of evolution when primitive hominids swung down from the trees and discovered how to scratch crude symbols onto rocks.    Nor did it begin after the Flood.  At least 2,000 years of human existence preceded the Flood, meaning that when Noah and his family entered the ark they carried at least one hundred years of pre-flood memories, traditions, technology, and superior knowledge. Their world view was shaped by the historical Adam and Eve and the generations of their offspring.   Thus Noah and his family brought with them not only the knowledge of the personal God, Special Creation, fall of man, the Deluge, sacrifice to God for the propitiation of sin, the arts of weapon-making and warfare, knowledge of letters, symbols, math, architecture, science, cosmetics, and agriculture  but knowledge of  first-hand encounters with Watchers, their occult teachings, the Nephilim, and primeval pantheism tied to magic, spiritism, herbal abortifacients, human and animal sacrifice, drinking of blood, males marrying males and even beasts, and many other evils.</p>
<p>In affirmation, the eminent researcher of antiquity James Bailey said:</p>
<p>“…<em>human history can now be hesitantly traced back as an unbroken narrative to 4000 B.C….the picture emerging…is one of the Fall of Man in historic terms as well as his rise; it is a picture…more of degradation than of success; it is a picture of monotheism breaking down into polytheism and of the struggle to return to monotheism.  The establishment view of the history of religion gradually progressing from animism to polytheism </em>(then)<em> to monotheism is the reverse of facts</em>.” (“The God-Kings and the Titans: The New World Ascendancy in Ancient Times 1973, p. 296)</p>
<p>Four thousand years before Christ were the antediluvian generations and the Watchers in the post-flood world, making the billions of years of evolutionary transformism a fabulous fable.  It is neither ‘new’ (Ecclesiastes 1: 9-11) nor scientific except in the sense of pre-flood and post-flood occult science and attendant traditions revised and revamped for our own time, as Geering unhappily discovered.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones writes that Geering was surprised when he found out that the<em> ‘New Spirituality’ </em>has <em>&#8220;links with pre-monotheistic&#8230;nature religions,</em>&#8221; leading Jones to wryly comment that in an odd turn of events,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;.contemporary spiritual&#8217; evolution goes backwards!  Biblical theism disturbed evolutionary progress.  The clocks have to be put back </em>(for we are in the presence of)<em> a powerful pagan/Gnostic theological agenda, claiming to be spanking new, objective and scientific, but as old as the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>Clocks have to be turned back, all the way back to the days of Noah in the pre-flood world where evolution is closely connected to the devil’s lie that man is a being who though presently limited in time and space is nevertheless capable of achieving a great leap of being and magically evolving into a much more powerful god-like being in the future.</p>
<p>As the scientifically endarkened Gnostic pagan Spirit of our age simultaneously worships on the altar of ‘self’ as it self-righteously peers down its’ long, pointy nose and contemptuously sniffs and sneers at the remnant of backwards, unscientific, anti-evolution  faithful, in reality it is the entirely deluded pagan Spirit that is on a collision course with a modern version of the pre-flood world catastrophe&#8212;-and we know how badly that ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>In this postmodern age many think that no one can know Truth. It is true that we cannot know truth if there is no revelation from God</i>.&#8221;  – Vishal Mangalwadi</p>
<p>Dr. Vishal Mangalwadi (1949&#8212;), founder-president of BOMI/Revelation Movement, is an Indian philosopher and social reformer.   He has lectured in over 40 countries and published seventeen books including &#8220;<i>The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization</i>!&#8221;  Mangalwadi&#8217;s Revelation Movement exists to re-establish the cultural authority of <i>VERITAS (Truth) </i>because God has revealed Truth in scripture and God has given man the mind and clues to help us discover what He has concealed. Proverbs 25:2.  (RevelationMovement.com)</p>
<p>In a recent e-mail message entitled &#8220;<i>The Kingdom of Darkness Encircles North America</i>,&#8221; Vishal writes that his third visit to North America opened his eyes to the magnitude and the power of a massive force of darkness facing the faithful.  Because darkness has deeply penetrated much of the body of the church it is hard to estimate how much essential theology and how many churches in North America have been lost.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are truth-warriors determinedly digging in their heels against the darkness that is rapidly encompassing both the church and North America.  Vishal compared these truth-warriors to Jedi knights and the Hobbits of middle earth who carried the day against Sauron:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>When Luke Skywalker joined the Star Wars saga, he had no idea that he was a Jedi. Nor did the tiny, motley crew that teamed up with him know what they were up against. To mix metaphors, they were little Hobbits, unaware of the importance of their mission</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>The Return of Sauron’s Kingdom of Darkness</b></p>
<p>During the “<i>Fading Years</i>,” many things of “<i>beauty and wonder remained on earth…”</i> but also many things of “<i>evil and dread</i>.” Then all things began to change.  A living darkness crept slowly through Greenwood the Great, and fear walked there in shadowy glades.  Then the name of the forest was changed to Mirkwood, for the “<i>nightshade lay deep there,</i>” and few dared pass through.  Whence the evil came few could tell,</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i> &#8220;&#8230;and it was long ere even the Wise could discover it.  It was the shadow of Sauron and the sign of his return&#8230;and all folk feared the Sorcerer of Dol Guldur, and yet they knew not at first how great was their peril.&#8221;</i>   (The Silmarillion, J.R.R. Tolkien, p. 299)</p>
<p>Sauron’s Kingdom of Darkness is evident in both the devastating loss of God&#8217;s revealed Truth, moral law and norms in our culturally desolate secular-atheist society as well as in the failure of Americans, within and without the whole body of the Christian Church, to restrain their own corrupt passions. (James 1:14-15)</p>
<p>Devilish depravity in the guise of special rights and privileges such as free phones, free gas, free housing, and free condoms together with the myth of evolution as scientific fact, perverse sex-education for tots and teens, same-sex and kundalini-Holy Spirit equality, the lie of global warming, paganized Christianity and a long list of destructive freedoms such as unfettered killing as &#8216;choice,&#8217; and ‘gay’ marriage and pornography and sodomy as Constitutionally guaranteed rights have become dictatorial both outside of the Church, where Sauron&#8217;s &#8216;secular&#8217; servants of sin demand all others give up their God-given rights in gratification of depraved desires, and within, where Sauron’s &#8216;Christian&#8217; servants of sin sweep away the essentials of the faith to make room for mindless, self-centered values resulting in lawless churches:</p>
<p>“<i>Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin. No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother. </i>(1 John 3:4-10)</p>
<p>Lawless churches are nothing more than Sauron&#8217;s social clubs for his servants of sin where they,</p>
<p>“…<i>exercise no discernment, enforce no standards, and teach more pop psychology than timeless truth. Naturally, lawless churches are populated with lawless Christians, the greatest absurdity of them all. “What fellowship have righteousness and lawlessness?” </i>1 Corinthians 6:14 (How can I walk North and South at the same time?&#8221; Lawless Christians, Dan Popp, Renew America, Mar. 10, 2012)</p>
<p>Dr. Kurt Koch (1913-1987), a noted German theologian who counseled and delivered thousands of people suffering from demonic bondage in its various forms throughout the world argues that sin cuts a person off from God. Sin opens the door to Sauron, meaning to demonic oppression and possession seen in relation to psychological distortions having the following predominant characteristics: narcissism, hard egoism, uncongenial dark nature, violent temper, belligerence, meanness, abnormal sexuality, blasphemous thoughts and rebellious, bigoted attitudes toward Christ and God, conscious atheism, and destructive, murderous rages. (Occult ABC, Koch, pp. 266-282)</p>
<p>Cutting Edge Ministries David Bay identifies the ‘values’ of the lawless as Satanic, and adds that lawless Americans at every level of society, both in and out of the church, have embraced Satanic values with no conscious awareness that they have done so.  When a people believe in nothing higher than &#8216;self&#8217;, they make personal selfishness, intellectual arrogance, irrational feelings, lying, covetousness, physical lust, hate and envy their gods.  The elevation of these Satanic values produces in them other strong desires: for power over others, for the amassing of material possessions and the acquisition of privilege, status, star-power, and wealth as well as powerful sexual urges that must be satisfied at any cost, no matter who or what might be harmed.  (Six Step Attitudinal Change Plan, Bay, Cutting Edge Ministries)</p>
<p>The Christian church is the only element in society with the moral authority and the availing remedy to counteract such manifest evil, but much of America&#8217;s Christian church has been compromised, thereby rendered impotent.   Having compromised and conformed itself in one way or another to our paganized culture and dictates of the scientism/evolution crowd it is no longer salt and light, thus on the fast track to being spewed out.</p>
<p>Malachi Martin, author of &#8220;<i>Hostage to the Devil: the Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans</i>,&#8221; briefly outlines the spiritually desolate condition and resulting consequences of the compromising church:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Among the general population of Catholics and Christians of other denominations, large numbers of people no longer learn even so basic a prayer as the Our Father.   In churches and parochial schools alike, the subject of Hell is avoided, as one Midwestern priest put it, in order not to put people on a &#8216;guilt trip.&#8217;  The idea of sin is likewise avoided, according to the same source, in order not to do &#8216;irreparable damage to what has been taught for the past fifteen years</i>.&#8221; (P. xvi)</p>
<p>Fearing rejection by our paganized culture and scientistic/evolutionary establishment, compromising <wbr></wbr>churches refuse to contaminate what is termed the &#8216;rational&#8217; and ‘scientific’ with the essentials of the faith necessary both for salvation and for the recognition of evil.  And without the grace that is born of true faith,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.<i>Satan does what he does best&#8212;he ceases to exist in the eyes of those who do not see</i>.&#8221; (ibid)</p>
<p>Consequently, a favorable climate exists for the occurrence of demonic oppression and possession among the general population:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Possession among the general population is so clear that it is attested to daily by competent social and psychological experts, who for the most part, appear to have no &#8216;religious bias.&#8217;  Our cultural desolation&#8212;a kind of agony of aimlessness coupled with a dominant self-interest&#8212;is documented for us in the disintegration of our families.  In the break-up of our educational system.  In the disappearance of publicly accepted norms of decency in language, dress and behavior.  In the lives of our youth, everywhere deformed by stunning violence and sudden death, by teenage pregnancy; by drug and alcohol addiction; by disease; by suicide; by fear.&#8221;</i> And whether spoken or acted out without explanation, the dominant question of the deformed generation is<i>, &#8220;What can you do for me?  What can my parents, my friends, my acquaintances, my enemies, my government, my country, do for me?&#8221;</i> (pp. xiii-xiv)</p>
<p>Overshadowing secular-atheist America is a malevolent, living darkness sweeping virtually unseen in and through our society and compromising churches.</p>
<p>Dr. Carl Raschke, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Denver, concurs.  His chilling book “<i>Painted Black</i>” takes you through the minds of the deviant and murderous and then explores the growing evil sweeping through our hometowns.  He concludes that the decadence, pornography, heavy metal music, drug culture, fantasy role-playing games, cruelty, mass murders, criminality, the ‘new religions’ and upsurge in overt Satanism in American culture have certain social and spiritual ties that bind them together, revealing that they are part of a similar dark spiritual genus enabled by mystification of the most corrupt passions and secular values:</p>
<p>“<i>Satanism is but the spiritual Frankenstein created by a social order that has attempted to sustain itself without God</i>.” (Satanism and Witchcraft: The Occult and the West — Part 6, Dr. John Ankerberg and Dr. John Weldon)</p>
<p>America&#8217;s spiritual Frankenstein bears a striking similarity to the pre-flood Frankenstein of Noah&#8217;s time:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Barbarism is that which prevailed from the days of Adam down through ten generations to the time of Noah. It is called barbarism because of the fact that in those times men had no ruling authority or mutual accord, but every man was independent and a law unto himself after the dictates of his own will.&#8221;</i> (John of Damascus, &#8220;The Fount of Knowledge,&#8221; cited in Political Apocalypse, Ellis Sandoz, p. 131)</p>
<p>Sauron’s Kingdom of Darkness has slowly crept into and changed all things in the West and America.  Within its&#8217; living shadow barbarians situated within our government, media, entertainment, military, law enforcement, academia, and compromised church work their destructive magic while fell beasts and shapes of dread openly hunt the spiritually blind in the shadowy glades of the American Mirkwood.</p>
<p>Please pray that our Lord will cleanse, revive and fortify His church and build up a force for spiritual and cultural resistance and renewal.   America desperately needs an army of courageous, selfless Hobbits: faithful male and female truth-warriors who will stand and fight the forces of darkness for both the soul of America and individual souls who, though their eyes are open, they cannot see the infernal darkness closing in on them.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/meditationblue3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/meditationblue2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Today we’re hearing a lot about <em>Spiritism or Spiritualism</em>, not to be confused with spiritual or spirituality, as in “I’m not religious, I’m spiritual,” or “I’m into spirituality.”  The term Spiritism has replaced what was once called <a href="http://religion-cults.com/Ancient/Animism/Animism.htm" target="_blank">animism</a> and other religious practices involving the invocation of spiritual beings.</p>
<p>Some religions meld <a href="http://religion-cults.com/Occult/Spirtualism/Spirtualism.htm" target="_blank">Spiritualism</a> with Christianity.  For example, a blend of Christian and African folk beliefs that originated in Brazil is now practiced in the U.S.   Spiritualism is much the same as Spiritism only it has adopted Christian rites and prayers.  People visiting Spiritualistic services can be misled into thinking they’re Christian churches.  The problem is Christianity cannot be melded with any other religion or practice.</p>
<p>One of the major tenets of Spiritism is <a href="http://carm.org/questions/other-questions/can-christian-believe-reincarnation" target="_blank">reincarnation</a>.  The classic form of reincarnation originated in India in the 9th century BC.  Reincarnation has become a hot topic in our post-modern culture.</p>
<p>There are a whole host of beliefs about reincarnation.  The most widely touted belief  is that upon death one’s spirit exits the body in search of another body to inhabit. Believing in reincarnation gives hope for continuing one’s existence in further lives to work off one’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma" target="_blank">karma</a>.  Karma is broadly defined as the consequences of one’s actions.</p>
<p>Ask professing Christians as they flow through the doors of a Sunday worship service if they believe in reincarnation, some will give you a cavalier “Yes,” as if it’s no big deal for believers to mix Christianity with mystical beliefs.  However, believing in reincarnation is a very big deal for the serious Christian.  For example, reincarnation is a central tenet within Hinduism, not Christianity!</p>
<p>The thing Christians need to come to terms with is that belief in reincarnation goes against what the Bible teaches regarding the soul’s final judgment by a holy God.  What Jesus Christ clearly taught is that unrepentant sinners are condemned to an eternity in hell.  Jesus never mentioned reincarnation – not once!</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:27 reveals what occurs when human beings die:</p>
<p><em>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.</em></p>
<p>Listen to what Paul says happens when we die:</p>
<p><em>We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</em>(2 Cor. 5:8)</p>
<p>It is imperative that serious Christians view mysticism as evil.  When Paul came face to face with the Jewish mystic Elymas, he charged him with being a child of the devil and an enemy of righteousness. Moreover, he accused the mystic of perverting the right ways of the Lord.  (Acts 13:10)  Through the power of the Holy Spirit, Paul caused him to go blind.  Not only did he put out the sorcerer’s eyes, he also put him out of a job! When it came to confronting evil, Paul never backed down, never hesitated, wavered or vacillated.  He had all the subtlety of a sledgehammer when it came to evildoers.</p>
<p>God forbids any sort of participation in paganism for our own protection.  His reason is simple: its roots are steeped in pagan idolatry and drug use.  The occult world is an open door to Satan’s world.  Those who enter find themselves on a quest for ‘hidden wisdom’ or ‘deeper truth.’  And, not surprisingly, the sought after ‘hidden wisdom’ is not meant for everyone, it’s meant for a select few such as New Age disciples and gurus.</p>
<p>We call those who possess supernatural power (power’s what it’s all about) shamans, witchdoctors, clairvoyants, trance channelers, spiritists, and the list goes on.  So, how does a spiritist go about getting in contact with the spirit world?  By receiving radiation, frequencies or vibrations from the dead.  “Communication from the spirit world manifests itself in psychical phenomena (e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance, trance speaking, and apparitions) and in physical phenomena (e.g., levitation, automatic writing, and poltergeist and ectoplasmic activities).” (<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/spiritism" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that it is God who instigates communication, not man.  Generally the Lord will use angels as His envoys to humans.  We know very little about angels, either the elect or the fallen.  However, the scriptures inform us that on occasion the Lord sent a holy elect angel to Earth to deliver messages. And He also sent angles to minister to people, to protect them, and also to execute His judgment.  The angels have one purpose: to glorify God’s holy Name and to carry out His will.</p>
<p>There are also fallen angels – the rebellious ones!  The most notorious of the lot is Lucifer aka Satan.  The Bible refers to the <a href="http://carm.org/fallen-angels" target="_blank">fallen angels</a> as demons, spirits of darkness and evil spirits.  The ones that rebelled against God fell from grace.  Consequently, they were hurled out of heaven, lock stock and barrel.  Bible expositor John MacArthur elucidates what happened next:</p>
<p><em>At that point, Satan gained the rulership of the world, and the term world took on a third meaning: the evil system opposed to God that now dominates this planet. The system that Satan began will continue to develop up to the time period known as the Great Tribulation.</em></p>
<p>As I have made clear, Christianity and Spiritism have nothing in common whatsoever.  I mean, think about it. Can you trust God and Satan at the same time?  Here’s what Paul said:</p>
<p><em>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</p>
<p>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the uncleanthing; and I will receive you, And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</em> (2 Cor. 6:14-18)</p>
<p>Satan is known as the “father of lies.”  Even those who are guided by an “inner voice” can be deceived, warns occultist Nicholas Weeks:</p>
<p><em>Channels such as [Alice] Bailey are sincere and convinced that their inner voices and visions are real Masters. Unhappily, sincerity is no protection from delusion. In 1884 Master KH wrote to a psychic of that time, giving an explanation for the befuddling of a channel or seer. ‘Since you have scarcely learned the elements of self-control, in psychism, you must suffer bad consequences. You draw to yourself the nearest and strongest influences &#8220;often evil&#8221; and absorb them, and are psychically stifled or narcotised by them. The airs become peopled with resuscitated phantoms. They give you false tokens, misleading revelations, deceptive images. Your vivid creative fancy evokes illusive Gurus and chelas [disciples], and puts into their mouths words coined the instant before in the mint of your mind, unknown to yourself. The false appear as real, as the true, and you have no exact method of detection since you are yet prone to force your communications to agree with your preconceptions.</em> (<a href="http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/baileyal.htm" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>And to think, many Christians are now engaged in magical mystical practices such as <a href="http://emailbrigade.com/305.html" target="_blank">contemplative prayer</a> that can give the practitioner misleading revelations and deceptive images, where the false may appear real.  (See a column I wrote on contemplative prayer <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/mwest/130416" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the spirits that speak through the mouths of the willing are demons.  People who get themselves into a mind-altering trance with the purpose being to channel a benevolent spirit may end up becoming demon possessed!  Granted, some channelers are really nothing more than convincing actors who write the script as they go along.  These are the charlatans who do it for money or fame &#8211; or both.  However, there are many dupes that allow their bodies to be used by spirit entities that use the occasion to spew anti-Christian propaganda!</p>
<p>The Bible tells us to, “Prove [test] all things; hold fast that which is good.” (1 John 4:1). We’re also told to flee (run like a maniac) from the devil who “walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (1 Peter 5:8) Now, picture a lion hiding in the brush to pounce on an unsuspecting wildebeest.  The devil’s like the hungry lion, only he’s waiting to pounce on Christ’s sheep!  Unfortunately many Christians fail to obey God’s command to resist the devil, which is one of the reasons Christianity’s in the sorry state it’s in today.</p>
<p>Far too many followers of Jesus Christ are unaware that our Lord quite literally detests all forms of sorcery. There are no exceptions!  Sorry to be a wet blanket, but even astrology is banned.  And it doesn’t matter if it’s done “just for fun.”  One cannot be a Presbyterian on Sunday and a spiritist the other six days of the week.</p>
<p>This brings me to two blogs I stumbled on.  Both male bloggers declare their love for Christ and state that the Bible is the standard by which they live their lives.  One studies apologetics; the other is a youth pastor.  They both have their Zodiac signs on display.  That way if you land on aspiring apologist’s blog, you’ll know that he’s a Gemini; likewise, if you land on youth pastor’s blog, you’ll discover that he’s a Virgo.  One can only assume that these young men have not yet read <a href="http://kingjbible.com/leviticus/19.htm" target="_blank">Leviticus 19:26</a>, <a href="http://kingjbible.com/deuteronomy/18.htm" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>, <a href="http://kingjbible.com/exodus/22.htm" target="_blank">Exodus 22:18</a> and other similar passages where God commands His people to steer clear of sorcery.  And yet these so-called Bible believers find time to read up on astrology?</p>
<p>Christians who are confronted with an evil practice must lace up their trusty running shoes and high tail it out of there, pronto!  Keep away from horoscopes (<a href="http://www.christiananswersforthenewage.org/Articles_Astrolgy.html" target="_blank">astrology</a>), numerology, séances, tarot cards, tealeaves, palm reading, crystal balls, talking boards, omens or signs.  Moreover, do not get involved in wizardry, witchcraft, the study of <a href="http://www.kabbalah.com/" target="_blank">Kabbalah</a>, nature religion (<a href="http://carm.org/religious-movements/wicca/misconceptions-about-wicca" target="_blank">Wicca</a>), and the practice of <a href="http://emailbrigade.com/304.html" target="_blank">yoga</a> (its sole purpose is purely spiritual). Believers must flee from any and all pagan customs and practices.  Those who are currently involved in any of the above must bring it to an end today!</p>
<p>Since dabbling in sorcery is a sin against God, repentance is of paramount importance.  So if you’ve been dabbling, repent! And never return to any sort of evil practice &#8212; even if it’s “just for fun.”</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the demonic powers operating in the realm of the occult are very real.  These spirits are stronger and more dangerous than people realize.  The Bible warns us to “regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.” (Lev. 19:31).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul understood all too well that evil forces are ever present in the “heavenlies.” Hence, he admonished followers of Christ to wear the “armor of God” to protect against familiar spirits that prey on gullible humans.  He even gave specific instructions to the Church in Ephesus:</p>
<p><em>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</em> (Ephesians 6:1-12).</p>
<p>Christian &#8212; take Paul’s instructions to heart and daily put on the full armor of God to protect against the rulers of the darkness of this world.</p>

			<p><strong>Sharia Law Is Not The Enemy&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/sharia-law-blue3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/sharia-law-blue2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>Devvy Kidd is an intelligent, incisive, and talented writer who stays at the vanguard in the fight to preserve freedom.  Her articles are well researched and widely read.  She is a lead writer for the NewsWithViews internet page which is and has been a potent force against the cloud of oppression that threatens our nation.</p>
<p><span>Nevertheless, I take issue with </span><a href="http://newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd561.htm" target="_blank">her recent column</a><span> entitled “Plotting for America to Be Ruled Under Sharia Law is Sedition”.</span></p>
<p><span>The NewsWithViews website is theologically Dispensational.   The intention of its owner and its excellent cadre of writers is honorable.  But, like most of our media, there is a dangerous and detrimental side that concentrates on symptoms, omits essentials, and directs our attention away from real danger.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Islam and Sharia Law are being skillfully used to create conflict and fear.  Fear and strife weaken the ability of a society to resist the despotic intentions of the elite globalists.  Islam is a heretical religion but like all religions it demands exclusivity making it an enemy to the prevailing United States religion of humanism.  The percentage of Muslims in the United States population is tiny compared to professing Christians but because it is a full orbed religion with a legal system and a vibrant world view it is growing rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span>Like Christianity, Islam has different theological factions.  Most Muslims are not militant.  They seek to live under Sharia law because they understand that law forms the religious base of society.  If Sharia law can be demonized and forbidden, the entire religion of Islam will quickly follow.   They have seen this occur in United States of America where human law has been allowed to supersede the overarching law of God making us a nation of flaccid professing Christians who live under and support a government controlled by Satanic forces.</span></p>
<p><span>The world is engaged in a religious war.  Christianity has been almost defeated in the United States but Islam is still alive and promoting Sharia law rather than the sinful laws of the elite power structure.  Since religion is changed by changing the law, antinomian Christianity was unable to stem the advance of humanism.  It lost the battle without a fight.  Islam’s Sharia law is a strong impediment to the advance of the pagan world order and every effort is being made to destroy it.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Devvy has fallen for the propaganda that makes Sharia law an enemy and written an article that creates fear and loathing for a religion that is an ally in the fight against the elite globalist agenda.  Christianity and Islam are god centered religions.  Talmudic Judaism is a humanistic religion.  Like the United States, Zionist, neo-Israel has a pagan government that regularly defies God’s Commandments.</span></p>
<p><span>Devvy provides a link to Publius Huldah’s Blog.  Ms. Huldah contends that our rights come from God and it is “the purpose of civil government to secure the Rights GOD gave us.”  She lists a number of rights that are God given and before copiously excoriating Muslims asserts that “God means for us to enjoy life!  Healthy food, wine and strong drink (in moderation); attractive dress for women, the marriage relation between man &amp; woman, prosperity, and liberty!”</span></p>
<p><span>This is rubbish!  God is not our bartender, He does not furnish blessing at our demand.  We are His servants not He ours.  Peace, freedom, and prosperity are results of obedience to His Law.   The Bible is not a book about human rights; but a documentation of the results of obedience and disobedience.  It is a book about obligation; our obligation to obey the Creator of the Universe.  In response to our obedience God promises us blessings.  Obligation first; blessing second.</span></p>
<p><span>Our adversary is a cunning, elite, nihilistic, cabal that is using deception, torture, murder, theft, and mass destruction to gain control of the entire planet.  They have no allegiance to an overarching morality; where their power reins, their word is law.  Their behavior provides an excellent example of human nature in its unrestrained form.  It is not new but another in the thousands of replays that history records.</span></p>
<p><span>Attempts to resurrect the United States Constitution are passé.  In 2002, powerful congressman </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hyde" target="_blank">Henry Hyde</a><span> responded to Ron Paul with this statement:  &#8220;There are things in the </span><a title="U.S. Constitution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution" target="_blank">Constitution</a><span> that have been overtaken by events, by time. Declaration of war is one of them&#8230;. Inappropriate, anachronistic, it isn&#8217;t done anymore.&#8221;  Unfortunately, congress began the process and President Obama has finished it.  The civil liberties outlined in the Bill of Rights have been superseded by laws and Executive orders that expose most of our population to false arrest, torture, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_rendition" target="_blank">extraordinary rendition</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Heretical Dispensational theology is the platform for the NewsWithViews Website and their  Christian writers often produce an aberrant description of the Will of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. NWVs elevates Talmudic Judaism and the neo-Pharisees from enemies of the Faith that Jesus railed against to leaders that are revered and preserved.  It distorts the Christian religion willed to us by the Reformers and by denying the validity of the law destroys the ability of Christianity to impact the social order.</span></p>
<p><span>The Talmud is an historic compilation of the thoughts of Rabbi’s; it is humanistic and often conniving.  Zionist Jews place the Talmud in a position similar to that of Mary in the Catholic religion but instead of being the Mother of God the Talmud is the father of the devil.  It puts the opinions of the Rabbis above the Word of God.  It affirms the superiority of the Jewish race.  It condones sinful behavior, allows God’s Law to be broken, and builds the ego of those who revere it.  In “Judaism’s Strange God’s” Michael Hoffman writes “The Talmud is such a heap of rubbish, and Judaism is so harmful to Judaic people, that it is difficult to find any good whatsoever in it.”  He goes on to describe the reverent regard given to Talmudic scholars by the Orthodox Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2012/11/26/the-osama-bin-laden-myth-2/" target="_blank">Paul Craig Robert’s recent column</a><span> contained a 2001 Pakistani interview with Osama bin Laden Bin Laden denied having anything to do with the 9/11 attack. He said, “I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children, and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children, and other people.”  This was a Pakistani interview.  Bin Laden was speaking to fellow Muslims.   We can decide not to believe him but we know our media lies to us and there is a good chance Osama is truthful.  His profession of honesty is far and away better than the rampant prevarication in our society!</span></p>
<p><span>The source material for Devvy’s article could have come directly from the propaganda machine of Judaism’s Zionist faction.  The same humanistic Zionists that have debased our morals with filthy movies, destroyed our culture with multi-culturalism, banished Christianity with the ACLU, attacked patriots with the Southern Poverty Law Center, fed us distorted and propagandized news through ownership of television stations, radio stations, newspapers, and book publishers;  the same group that surrounds and controls our government leaders and was the source for the warmongering Project for the New America Century (PNAC).  These are rabid humanists who seek to use our nation to invade Iran and stamp out the Muslim religion. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>It is not a Godly group, not a group that might accept Jesus as the propitiation for their sin.  Not a group that God would bless.  These are Christ haters; men and women who would crucify Jesus again today.  Their prayers cannot be heard by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  His ears are only attuned to the Name of His Son.  He does not hear prayers in the name of another.</span></p>
<p><span>No, my Christian friend, Sharia law is not the enemy.  Islam is an ally against humanistic world government.  Talmudic Jews are prominent in the elite cabal that seeks control of the world. Dispensational support for humanistic Judaism is Satanic.</span></p>
<p><span>There are few, if any, Christian heads-of-state in today’s world.  I was surprised to read of one such leader and of his eloquent prayer of repentance. </span><a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/636533-for-the-sins-of-uganda-i-repent-museveni.html" target="_blank"> This is the prayer</a><span> of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on the fiftieth anniversary of their independence from British rule:</span></p>
<p><span>“Father God in heaven, today we stand here as Ugandans, to thank you for Uganda. We are proud that we are Ugandans and Africans. We thank you for all your goodness to us.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I stand here today to close the evil past and especially in the last 50 years of our national leadership history and at the threshold of a new dispensation in the life of this nation. I stand here on my own behalf and on behalf of my predecessors to repent. We ask for your forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p>“We confess these sins, which have greatly hampered our national cohesion and delayed our political, social and economic transformation.”</p>
<p><span>“We confess sins of idolatry and witchcraft which are rampant in our land. We confess sins of shedding innocent blood, sins of political hypocrisy, dishonesty, intrigue and betrayal.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Forgive us of sins of pride, tribalism and sectarianism; sins of laziness, indifference and irresponsibility; sins of corruption and bribery that have eroded our national resources; sins of sexual immorality, drunkenness and debauchery; sins of unforgiveness, bitterness, hatred and revenge; sins of injustice, oppression and exploitation; sins of rebellion, insubordination, strife and conflict.”</span></p>
<p><span>“These sins and many others have characterised our past leadership, especially the last 50 years of our history. Lord forgive us and give us a new beginning. Give us a heart to love you, to fear you and to seek you. Take away from us all the above sins.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We pray for national unity. Unite us as Ugandans and eliminate all forms of conflict, sectarianism and tribalism. Help us to see that we are all your children, children of the same Father. Help us to love and respect one another and to appreciate unity in diversity.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We pray for prosperity and transformation. Deliver us from ignorance, poverty and disease. As leaders, give us wisdom to help lead our people into political, social and economic transformation.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We want to dedicate this nation to you so that you will be our God and guide. We want Uganda to be known as a nation that fears God and as a nation whose foundations are firmly rooted in righteousness and justice to fulfill what the Bible says in Psalm 33:12: Blessed is the nation, whose God is the Lord. A people you have chosen as your own.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I renounce all the evil foundations and covenants that were laid in idolatry and witchcraft. I renounce all the satanic influence on this nation. And I hereby covenant Uganda to you, to walk in your ways and experience all your blessings forever.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I pray for all these in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span>Are you listening America?</span></p>

<p>Zombies have shuffled their way into a resurgence in pop culture over the last decade, but nothing has come close to the fever pitch produced in the news over recent weeks.</p>
<p>First, there was the frightening yet strange ’zombie’ case in Miami, Florida, where Rudy Eugene was shot and killed by police when they found him gnawing the face off another man. The particulars of the case are still somewhat unclear, although that hasn’t stopped mainstream news from being ’apocalyptic’ in their reporting.</p>
<p>Eugene was reportedly <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/911-tape-prior-to-attack-miami-zombie-swung-from-a-light-pole-like-tarzan/1233798" target="_blank">acting as if he was on drugs</a> prior to the horrific attack, although the exact drug has not been verified (so the press has been cycling through them all). His girlfriend and mother claim he would never have voluntarily done such a thing, and thus he must have been drugged by <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/bizarre/girlfriend-miami-zombie-may-have-had-voodoo-spell-that-made-him-chew-off-a/1232922" target="_blank">persons unknown, or was a victim of a voodoo curse.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everybody says that he was a zombie, but I know he’s not a zombie; he’s my son,&#8221; she said.<br />
She said the man who ate another human being’s face was just not the son she knew.<br />
&#8220;I don’t know what they injected in him to turn him into the person who did what he did,&#8221; she said, making the motion of someone putting a syringe into the crook of her arm.</p></blockquote>
<p>A grieving mother’s denial? Probably. But it’s not outside the realm of possibility, as it’s well documented that government agencies publicly, and secretly, <a href="http://www.infowars.com/dhs-to-release-bacteria-in-boston-subway-system/" target="_blank">test biological agents against unsuspecting civilians</a>, without public consent or knowledge. The US military has engaged in dark medical experiments as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Experiments included administering LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions. LSD and other drugs were usually administered without the subject’s knowledge and informed consent, a violation of the Nuremberg Code that the U.S. agreed to follow after WWII.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://listverse.com/2008/03/14/top-10-evil-human-experiments/" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>
<p>Next came a story from Maryland, where a <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/326029" target="_blank">college student was arrested for killing a man</a>, dismembering him, and eating his heart and part of his brain. More cannibalism.</p>
<p>Then an incident in New Jersey, where a<a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hackensack-Man-Stabs-Self-Cuts-Skin-Intestines-Throws-Flesh-Police-155455985.html" target="_blank"> man stabbed himself 50 times</a> and threw bits of his own intestines at police. Police tasered him, but he was allegedly not subdued easily. ’Zombie-like’ strength and disassociation.</p>
<p>All on the back of this, was an international incident that seemed to heighten the ’zombie/cannibal’ phenomenon.</p>
<p>A man hunt just ended last week after authorities in Germany <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/05/luka-rocco-magnotta-vancouver/" target="_blank">arrested a young Canadian man, Luka Rocco Magnotta</a>, who is accused of killing and dismembering Jun Lin, a 33-year-old undergraduate student at Montreal’s Concordia University. Magnotta was dubbed the &#8220;Canadian Psycho&#8221; by international press.</p>
<p>Not only was much of the horror of the killing and dismemberment filmed and uploaded to the internet, but Magnotta then allegedly, after eating parts of his victim, packaged up the various body parts and sent them through the post to conservative and liberal Canadian political party offices, as well as two elementary schools.<br />
Jun Lin’s head and several limbs are still unaccounted for.</p>
<p>These cases, which would have traditionally been attributed to severe mental illness, are now being completely sensationalized, and described as zombie killings. The public has become very used to violence. We’re almost completely desensitized to violence. But cannibalism seems to strike at something different within us. For some, it’s compelling &#8211; for others, it’s a sign of end-times.</p>
<p>For all that they bemoan the tragedy, the media also embraces this sort of story to fuel their sales and ratings, and the public tunes in.</p>
<p>And why wouldn’t they? The very authority figures that the public look to for guidance and a voice of reason, like the Center for Disease Control (CDC), ran a campaign in 2011 to heighten awareness of the inevitable zombie apocalypse!</p>
<blockquote><p>In a May 16th blog entry on the CDC.gov website called: <strong>Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse</strong>, author Ali S. Khan asks the question, &#8220;Where do zombies come from and why do they love eating brains so much?&#8221; The article then goes on to suppose that &#8220;zombies would take over entire countries, roaming city streets eating anything living that got in their way. The proliferation of this idea has led many people to wonder &#8211; How do I prepare for a zombie apocalypse?&#8221;</p>
<p>CDC would provide technical assistance to cities, states, or international partners dealing with a zombie infestation. This assistance might include consultation, lab testing and analysis, patient management and care, tracking of contacts, and infection control (including isolation and quarantine).</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://redicecreations.com/article.php?id=15427" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>
<p>But now the CDC is reversing its stance on an undead holocaust, and has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/01/cdc-denies-zombies-existence_n_1562141.html" target="_blank">denied the existence of zombies. </a></p>
<p>With the media hyping zombies, government agencies considering zombies, and corporations pushing any products they can associate with zombies, it should come as no surprise that scammers now are getting in on the action.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause of the macabre and grisly cannibalism of these recent reports, there was no doubt that although viewers were sickened, they were also intrigued. To many, it felt like the unfolding plot of a horror movie, and the media seemed all too willing to provide all the gory details.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;there is surveillance footage of Eugene’s May 26 attack, but the 18-minute video, embedded in articles from local Miami news sources including the Miami Herald, is partially obscured by a bridge. There is no other video, no &#8220;exclusive&#8221; footage or &#8220;never-before-seen&#8221; angle. This is important to remember, as online scammers, in a plea to get you to click on possibly harmful links, often promise to show you the &#8220;real&#8221; videos or photos you haven’t seen.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://digitallife.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/01/12011418-scammers-hope-youll-bite-on-zombie-news?lite&amp;ocid=todmsnbc11" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>
<p>The audience’s &#8220;thirst for gore&#8221; is what makes the scammers successful. It’s what drives the press to publish continuous updates (even the irrelevant minutiae) on these horrific, real life tragedies. The gruesome ’infotainment’ stretches the boundaries of credulity and traps the viewer in a dissonance, a mental conflict where it’s necessary to sort out what is real and what is unreal from a source that is <em>supposed</em> to tell the truth but seldom does.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Zombies and ghoulish creatures might be mainstream fare right now, but like many myths they have a history that stretches back through the ages. Before you become convinced that the ’zombie apocalypse’ is upon us because the reporting is reaching saturation, keep in mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though many people treat the current “zombie apocalypse” as a fun pop culture meme, it’s important to realize that some people believe zombies are very real. Haitian culture &#8212; like many African cultures &#8212; is heavily steeped in belief in magic and witchcraft. Belief in zombies is related to the Voodoo religion, and has been widespread throughout Haiti for decades. The existence of zombies is not questioned, though believers would not recognize the sensational, Hollywood brain-eating version that most Americans are familiar with.</p>
<p>Unlike today’s malevolent movie zombies, the original Haitian zombies were not villains but victims. They are corpses who have been re-animated and controlled by magical means for some specific purpose (usually labor). Historically, fear of zombies was used as a method of political and social control in Haiti. Those people believed to have the magical power to zombify a person &#8212; mainly witch doctors called bokors &#8212; were widely feared and respected.</p></blockquote>

			<p><img title="jimmypage-august2006-01" src="http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jimmypage-august2006-01.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="355" /><br />
It was popularly believed in the 1930s that the legendary bluesman Robert Johnson, who inspired Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton, sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his musical gifts. It was believed Johnson had the ‘Evil Eye’ and was murdered because of his alleged power over women. He seduced the wife of a beer hall owner who in revenge laced the musician’s whisky with arsenic. Many moralists saw his fate as a punishment for dealing with the powers of darkness.</p>
<p>Johnson is said to have sold his soul to Old Nick during a midnight ceremony at a crossroads. However, that story did not originate with him. In the 1920s and 1930s there are numerous tales of black musicians and gamblers signing a pact with a mysterious ‘man in black’ at the crossroads. Famous examples are the black singer Clara Smith and Robert Johnson’s namesake Tommy Johnston, a decade before him. The dark stranger has been identified by some writers as either the Christian Devil or the West African trickster god Eshu, worshipped in voodoo and taken to the southern states of America by black slaves.</p>
<p>While there is little evidence of modern pop and rock musicians actually ‘selling their souls’ to the ‘Devil’, the link between popular music and the occult is a strong one. Christian fundamentalists have predictably seen the widespread use of magical and occult symbols in rock music as evidence it is the work of Satan, but the truth is far stranger than their religious fantasies.</p>
<p>Sometimes the alleged connections of famous rock musicians with occultism surfaced in apocryphal showbiz gossip or rumour. For example, <em>everyone knows</em> that ill-fated glam rock star Marc Bolan studied as a sorcerer’s apprentice with a magician in a French chateau (in fact he actually admitted it), that the late pop diva Dusty Springfield allegedly belonged to a satanic group called the Temple of the Prince in Manchester, and that Jim Morrison of The Doors married a Wiccan high priestess (which was true).</p>
<p>Then there was the 1970s British musician Graham Bond, accused by his fellow R &amp; B artist Long John Baldry of sacrificing his pet cat in a magical ritual. Bond told his groupies he was one of the illegitimate sons of the infamous ‘black magician’ Aleister Crowley, and that his musical output was designed to contact “higher forces.” Bond also believed he had been cursed by a fellow occultist. When in 1974 the musician fell in front of a train on the London Underground in mysterious circumstances, many thought the curse had worked.</p>
<h2>The Beatles &amp; the Rolling Stones</h2>
<p>The Beatles are well known for flirting with Eastern mysticism and transcendental meditation during their psychedelic hippy stage in the late 1960s. They may also have had darker interests. For instance, the Great Beast 666, Aleister Crowley, is featured (top left corner above) in the photomontage of “people we most admire” on the cover of the Fab Four’s famous album <em>Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.</em></p>
<p>Antiquarian bookseller and Crowley bibliographer Timothy D’Arch Smith relates how the Beatles attended an exhibition of rare books on witchcraft and the occult he held in Swinging London. Jane Asher, Paul McCartney’s then girlfriend, had suggested the visit to him and, according to D’Arch Smith, encouraged him to buy rare books as an investment.</p>
<p>If the Beatles were mildly interested in the occult, then their main rivals for the pocket money and affection of teenage girls, the Rolling Stones, were definitely involved in a more dramatic way. Despite their respectable middle-class backgrounds, in the Sixties the Stones were deliberately promoted as the ‘bad boys of pop’. It now seems this was a marketing ploy by their then manager Andrew Oldham, and is summed up in the famous newspaper headline, ‘Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?’ If the parents of Middle England had known about their dabbling in the occult, the answer may have been in the negative.</p>
<h2>Lucifer Rising</h2>
<p>The so-called ‘satanic’ influence on the Stones was through the avant-garde filmmaker, Luciferian and Tinseltown gossip-queen Kenneth Anger. He had become interested in the band’s career and particularly in guitarist Brian Jones and his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, a German film actress and model. Jones had some unusual interests, and both he and the pop singer Robert Palmer were fascinated by the master musicians of Joujouka in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco in North Africa. These musicians claimed to be still practising the ancient rites of the goat-footed god Pan. Jones went so far as to travel to North Africa to record an album of the tribal music performed by this pre-Islamic cult.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine Robert Palmer described how he had witnessed one of these rites to Pan. He said the dancing tribesmen appeared to be in an ecstatic trance with their eyes rolled back in their heads. Palmer said that when “the power came down” the dancer was suddenly “not there.” In fact “something else” was looking out of his eyes, which began to “glow like ruby lasers” (<em>Rolling Stone, </em>23 March 1989)<em>.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Kenneth Anger believed that Anita Pallenberg and Brian Jones, who was to drown in mysterious circumstances in the swimming pool of his Sussex mansion, were witches. Allegedly, Jones showed the filmmaker an extra nipple he had on his inner thigh and told him: “In another time they would have burned me [as a witch].” Extra nipples were regarded by witch-hunters as a sign of the Devil’s Mark. A friend of Anita Pallenberg, Tony Sanchez, believed she kept her drug stash hidden in an old carved wooden chest in her flat. One day he looked inside. Instead of drugs he found it contained bones and pieces of fur and skin from “strange animals.” Mick Jagger’s one time girlfriend Marianne Faithfull described how she and Pallenberg used to sit for hours reading aloud passages from Robert Graves’ book <em>The White Goddess </em>and studying the ancient Celtic tree alphabet.</p>
<p>In her autobiography Marianne Faithfull claims the gay Anger had a crush on the bisexual Stones’ singer which was not reciprocated. When the filmmaker’s sexual overtures were rejected he became a bit of a nuisance. One day he turned up at the couple’s house in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea and bizarrely threw several books by the 18th century poet and mystic William Blake through the window. Jagger responded in disgust at this stunt by burning all the copies of the occult works that Anger had given him by Crowley and the French occultist Eliphas Levi.</p>
<p>Despite this, Marianne Faithfull got involved in Anger’s experimental movie <em>Lucifer Rising</em>, allegedly financially sponsored by Anita Pallenberg, and with a score originally to be composed by Mick Jagger. Initially the Stones’ singer was to play the leading role in the film, but he got cold feet and backed out of the project altogether. In the first version, made in 1967, the lead was taken by his brother Chris Jagger. Marianne Faithfull became involved in the second version filmed in 1972 and she agreed to take the part of the demon-goddess Lilith.</p>
<p>Faithfull described the baby-slaying Lilith as one of the classic female archetypes and compared her with pagan goddesses such as Diana, Astarte, Ishtar, Aphrodite and Demeter. However, she added: “From the view of patriarchy, of course, she was the pure incarnation of evil” (<em>Faithfull </em>by Marianne Faithfull with David Datton, 224). Interestingly, the part of the ancient Egyptian god Osiris in the film was played by Donald Cammell, son of Charles Cammell, a friend and biographer of Crowley. The younger Cammell made his own films including the controversial <em>Performance </em>in co-operation with Nic Roeg. It starred Mick Jagger, Anita Pallenberg and the archetypal English actor Edward Fox. Donald Cammell committed suicide in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The shooting of <em>Lucifer Rising</em> took place in Egypt and Faithfull claims that as soon as the crew and cast arrived in the country it was obvious Anger did not know what he was doing as either a film director or a magician. At that stage in her life Faithfull was seriously addicted to heroin and admits she did not know what she was doing on the set either. The whole thing was a recipe for disaster. The last sequence of the film was a winter solstice rite shot at a Neolithic site in Germany. During it, Faithfull managed to fall off a mountain. She somersaulted and landed on her feet without sustaining any injury. This convinced her that her magic was stronger than Anger’s. In her autobiography she dismissed him as a “kitsch occultist” and “a witch out of a Hollywood tabloid.”</p>
<p>Marianne Faithfull claims that both Mick Jagger and the Stones’ lead guitarist Keith Richards were also sceptical about Anger’s “satanic hocus-pocus” and did not take any of it seriously. However, after an incident involving the magician at the house in London now shared by Richards and Anita Pallenberg, Faithfull became seriously spooked out. As a result, she believed she was under psychic attack. Allegedly, she wore a clove of garlic around her neck and slept in a circle of lit candles for protection. Whether this paranoid behaviour was connected to her heroin addiction is not known.</p>
<p>One of Marianne Faithfull’s tracks on her comeback album <em>Broken English</em> is called ‘Witches Song’. She dedicates it as “my ode to the wild pagan woman I know and have always around me.” Faithfull says she got the idea for the song after she and Mick Jagger visited an exhibition in Madrid of paintings on the theme of the Witches Sabbath by the Spanish artist Goya. Her autobiography also describes an incident when she and Jagger took LSD before visiting Primrose Hill in North London “where the ancient ley lines are supposed to run” and where modern neo-druids hold their seasonal ceremonies. Under the influence of the acid the couple saw “a great face in the sky” they were convinced was the head of the Celtic giant god Bran. This seems to fit with Faithfull’s professed pagan beliefs. In her autobiography she says she believes not in God the Father, but in the Great Goddess and her consort Pan.</p>
<h2>Jimmy Page &amp; Aleister Crowley</h2>
<p>In 1969 the satanic aura around the rock mega-group Led Zeppelin reached such a pitch that, in echoes of Robert Johnson, rumours circulated in the Los Angeles music scene that its members had signed a pact in their own blood with the Devil to gain fame.</p>
<p>James Patrick ‘Jimmy’ Page’s well-known interest in the occult fuelled these rumours of the group’s alleged satanic activities. Described by the magazine <em>AllMusic</em> as “one of the all-time most influential, important and versatile [rock] guitarist and songwriters,” Page had been interested in alternative religions since childhood. While a member of the Yardbirds, he had hung out with Brian Jones and Anita Pallenberg at their studio flat in South Kensington. Page has never hidden his interest in Aleister Crowley, and Led Zeppelin’s famous album <em>Rune</em> has a photograph of the Great Beast on its cover. In an interview with <em>Sounds</em> magazine in 1976 Page is quoted as saying that Crowley was “a misunderstood genius of the twentieth-century.”</p>
<p>Jimmy Page purchased as many artefacts and first edition books belonging to Crowley that he could find. In 1969, Kenneth Anger rented Crowley’s old (seriously haunted) house Boleskine on the shores of Loch Ness where he lived in the 1900s for a few months. When it came on the market for sale, Anger suggested to Page he should buy it. This he did and hired an occult artist called Charles Pace to paint suitable atmospheric magical murals in each room. The Led Zeppelin guitarist could be seen driving around the area like a Scottish laird in a Land Rover with a stack of stag’s antlers on the bonnet. Page also visited Sicily and contemplated buying the old villa where Crowley established his ‘Abbey of Thelema’ in the 1920s.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s Page opened an occult bookshop in Kensington called The Equinox. It was done out in a futuristic style with glass bookshelves and display cabinets and chrome steel pillars. Under its auspices, Page published a facsimile of Crowley’s 1904 edition of the medieval grimoire <em>Goetia.</em></p>
<p>Kenneth Anger approached Jimmy Page and asked him to provide a soundtrack for his ongoing film project <em>Lucifer Rising</em>. Unfortunately, the two men fell out when Page only managed to produce 23 minutes of music and Anger wanted 28 minutes. The filmmaker accused Page of being a mere dabbler in the occult and a drug addict so out of his mind he could not finish the film score. However, in 1976 Page lent Anger the basement of his London house for film editing purposes. Again, the two men did not see eye to eye and Page allegedly cursed the filmmaker. Page later branded the incident as “silly and pathetic” and said he still respected Anger as an occultist.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of debate about whether Jimmy Page ever belonged to one of the modern versions of Crowley’s magical group the OTO (Ordo Templis Orientis or Order of the Eastern Temple). In fact, the jury seems to be out on whether Page is an actual magical practitioner at all. In this respect <em>New Musical Express</em> journalist Nick Kent dismisses rumours the guitarist spends his time with “his head in a cowl ritually slaughtering various species of livestock.” Kent instead says from his experience Page is “just another seeker after esoteric knowledge, a collector of dusty old books, and committed student of the ‘magical’ information that was supposedly contained in their yellowed pages.”</p>
<p>Although Jimmy Page’s interest in Crowley and the occult is well known, his Led Zeppelin colleague Robert Plant also has esoteric interests. These manifest in a study of folklore, Norse and Germanic mythology, and reading ‘sword and sorcery’ novels. Plant spent most of his life living on the Welsh Border and in an interview with the rock music magazine <em>Kerrang!</em> he said he often visited the Black Mountains in South Wales. There he rediscovered his roots in the local Celtic culture. Using an ordnance survey map, he wandered the hills visiting Bronze Age sites and places where the Welsh had battled with the Saxons.</p>
<h2>David Bowie</h2>
<p>Another famous rock star who openly admits an interest in the occult, magic and Crowley is David Bowie (born David Robert Jones). In the 1970s he says he studied the Kabbalah and “Crowleyism” and more recently became interested in Gnosticism. On a practical level the singer used Tarot cards and a crystal ball for divination, an ouija board to contact spirits, and performed magical rituals for exorcism and psychic protection. His early album <em>Hunky-Dory</em> features a song called ‘Quicksand’ that references both Crowley and the Victorian magical group Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.</p>
<p>According to David Bowie’s wife Angie in her autobiography, her husband’s interest in the occult was due to his desire to outdo Jimmy Page. Allegedly, he saw the Led Zeppelin guitarist as a magical rival. Bowie eventually decided, possibly because of Page’s interest in him, that Crowley and his works were “small shit.” For that reason he began studying Tibetan magic which he claimed was far more powerful than anything the Great Beast or Page had ever done.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>New Musical Express</em> (February 1997) David Bowie admits he had been into “old fashioned magic” in the 1970s, and said he always believed Crowley was a charlatan. He reveals that Arthur Edward Waite, a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, and the Welsh-born occultist Dion Fortune, author of <em>Psychic Self-Defence</em>, have been important to him. In fact, Bowie used Fortune’s book extensively when he believed he was under psychic attack. Talking of a house he rented in Los Angeles in 1975, Bowie said he decorated it with ancient Egyptian artefacts. This was because, “I had this more than passing interest in Egyptian mysticism and the Kabbalah…” (<em>Stage Fascination: David Bowie the Definite Story </em>by David Buckley, 235).</p>
<p>Angie Bowie says the musician was heavily involved with occult activities in 1975-76. This coincides with a period when he used cocaine and she believed this made him paranoid. Apparently, Bowie stored bottles of his own urine in the fridge and carefully disposed of his nail and hair clippings. This was in case magical practitioners obtained these personal items in order to cast spells on him. He also set up an altar in his sitting room with black candles on it, painted occult symbols on the walls, and performed magical banishing rituals for protection. Angie Bowie once witnessed him exorcise a swimming pool he believed was haunted.</p>
<p>When the couple were viewing properties to rent or buy in Hollywood they came across an old house with a pentagram of five-pointed star painted on the floor. Bowie freaked out and said he could not live there as the building had been used for black magic rites. One day he phoned his wife and told her witches were trying to steal his semen. Allegedly they wanted to create a test-tube baby and then sacrifice it in a satanic rite. It turned out the ‘witches’ were just some innocent groupies he met in a bar.</p>
<p>At this difficult point in his life Bowie also flirted with neo-Nazism. He explained in an interview with the British rock music journalist Tony Parsons in 1993 that this was only because he was fascinated by the use of occult symbols like the swastika by the original Nazi Party in Germany. He was interested in their quest for the Holy Grail because he was also searching for its meaning (<em>Stage Fascination: David Bowie the Definite Story </em>by David Buckley, 235-236). Bowie once said that it might be a good idea to have a fascist dictatorship in Britain, although he later denied he was serious and claimed it was a joke.</p>
<h2>Black Sabbath &amp; Heavy Metal</h2>
<p>Partly as a reaction to the hippy ‘flower power’ and ‘peace and love’ movement of the late Sixties, heavy metal bands began to appear using violent satanic imagery and playing loud over-amplified rock music. Groups such as Warlock, Saxon, Venom, Motley Crue, W.A.S.P., Slayer, Iron Maiden, Incubus and Bathory put out albums with covers decorated with human skulls, pentagrams, hooded figures, gravestones, goat-headed demons and vampires. One of the most famous and pioneering heavy metal bands Black Sabbath came out of Birmingham in the industrial Midlands of England in 1969. They combined heavy guitar riffs with satanic inspired lyrics and an obsession with the gothic dark side that soon gave them a dedicated, if rather odd, fan base.</p>
<p>The band’s distinctive name was taken from an old horror movie starring English actor Boris Karloff, famous for his movie interpretation of Dr. Frankenstien’s monster. Originally, Black Sabbath started out as a jazz-blues band until they became influenced by the ‘black magic’ novels of the thriller writer Dennis Wheatley and books by Aleister Crowley. Their leader ‘Geezer’ Butler was lent a 16th century grimoire or book of magic. Its contents so freaked him out that he locked it in a cupboard before going to bed. During the night he had a spectral visitation from a dark shadowy figure who stood at the end of his bed. In the morning when Butler opened the cupboard the grimoire had vanished and it was never seen again.</p>
<p>Butler claims the band was invited to play a gig at a Witches Sabbath at Stonehenge, which sounds like something out of a Dennis Wheatley novel. When the boys refused the chief “warlock” of the coven ritually cursed the band. Geezer says he consulted a “white witch” to get the curse lifted and was told the band had to wear crosses to ward off the evil forces directed at them. Apparently, lead singer Ozzy Osbourne’s father, who was a bit of a handyman, made the crosses for each of the band members to wear.</p>
<p>Ozzy Osbourne always denies he was seriously into the occult, although he did have his Tarot cards read – twice. Famously he said the only evil spirits that interest him are whisky, gin and vodka! He describes the strange people attracted to the band, who habitually wear white face make-up and black hooded robes, as “freaks.” Ozzy says the only good thing about all the satanic stuff is it gave the band free publicity increasing their record sales and bank accounts.</p>
<p>Some of the heavy metal bands took their interest in witchcraft and magic more seriously. One of these, for a while, was Black Widow who played a mixture of progressive rock and folk music and used demonic imagery in their act based on serious research. In 1968 the group’s manager approached Maxine and Alex Sanders, the so-called ‘King and Queen of the Witches’. He wanted to know if the couple could recommend a nubile young witch with dancing skills to take part in their new stage act. This featured a magician played by one of the band’s members conjuring up a demon who was once an ancient goddess called Ashtaroth.</p>
<p>Several professional dancers auditioned for the part of the demon-goddess. Each one suffered fainting fits during rehearsals and felt they were being possessed by an evil spirit. In desperation the band wanted to hire a real witch who would not be fazed by the magical goings-on. Black Widow’s manager said the Sanders were happy to help and he described them as “clever business people” only interested in making money in any way they could.</p>
<p>A member of the Sanders’ coven volunteered for the role and the rehearsals were successful. Unfortunately, on the day of the first performance at the Lyceum Theatre in London, she fell ill. Alex Sanders volunteered his wife and the high priestess of the coven Maxine as a suitable stand-in. When the lead singer of Black Widow playing the sorcerer invoked the demon-goddess and accidentally stepped out of the protective magical circle, she was supposed to attack him. In her autobiography Maxine Sanders says the singer complained afterwards about the bruises he suffered from the physical assault by the ‘Queen of the Witches’.</p>
<h2>Danny Carey</h2>
<p>Another more contemporary band called Tool and its lead singer Danny Carey are well known for their interest in all things magical. Carey collects rare limited edition publications by such modern occult practitioners as Crowley, Kenneth Grant, Austin Osman Spare and Andrew D. Chumbley. During their recordings of albums, Tool use magical banishing rituals to get rid of unwelcome influences left in the studio by previous performers. They have also been known to employ talismans and occult sigils used by the Elizabethan magician and astrologer Dr. John Dee in their gigs. During a South American tour, local Christian workers refused to handle the band’s equipment because it was “satanic.”</p>
<p>The 1990s saw a sinister link established between rock music and Satanism with the rise of the so-called ‘black metal’ or ‘death metal’ groups. These new bands were committed to an anti-Christian philosophy of anarchism, nihilism, violence and an obsession with death that made Black Sabbath stage appearances look like a vicar’s tea party. Possibly the most dramatic and violent manifestation of this new trend was in Scandinavia. A new cultural trend united satanic beliefs with atavistic forms of neo-paganism and extreme nationalist right-wing politics promoting racism and white supremacy. This deadly combination was to lead to arson and murder.</p>
<p>In 1992 an ancient wooden stave church was burnt down in a firebomb attack. Rumours began circulating that hard-core black metal fans were responsible for the outrage. It was alleged they were pagan Viking revivalists who expressed neo-Nazi views. Further church burnings and graveyard desecrations took place followed by murders involving rival groups of black metal fans and biker gangs. Media reports said that self-styled teenage satanists saw neo-Nazism and rock music as cultural stepping stones to a revival of Aryan-based paganism. Because the historic Christian churches were built on the site of pagan temples, they had to be destroyed before the heathen ‘old religion’ could be established again.</p>
<p>Today the number of rock bands using satanic and occult imagery is increasing. The new ‘high priest’ of the Church of Satan in the USA, Boyd Rice, is himself a musician. Critics have dubbed his musical output as “sonic terrorism as an art form.” Strangely enough, his satanic master, Anton LaVey, who found the Church of Satan in the 1960s, preferred Gershwin and Cole Porter with his bedtime cocoa.</p>
<p>It seems certain that in the future wherever and however rock music is played, there will always be those who claim, quite literally, the Devil has the best tunes.</p>

			<p><em>Amy Winehouse’s untimely death was a sad event yet it brought to many a sentiment of deja-vu. She is indeed one of several artists who died at the age of 27 and one of the many celebrities who lost their lives in strange circumstances. Is there more to these deaths than meets the eye?</em></p>

<p>Famous for her distinctive voice and soulful style and infamous for her controversies and substance abuse, Amy Winehouse embodied the classic dichotomy of a rock star: artistic brilliance coupled with a tendency for self-destruction. Her early death, at age 27, provided her the last ingredient required to become a memorable rock star: eternal youth. Going beyond her music, Winehouse will now be remembered as one of those who “lived fast and died young” and will forever have this mystical aura that surrounds those who have passed away during their prime. We will never see Amy Winehouse grow old and lose her edge. We will never see her become a “has been” who has to appear in crappy commercials to pay the bills. By dying at the age of 27, Amy Winehouse will forever be remembered as the fiery diva who inspired, shocked, attracted and repulsed people all at once. Most importantly, by dying at the age of 27, Amy Winehouse became the latest member of the 27 Club.</p>
<h2>27 Club</h2>
<div>

</dl>
</div>
<p>The 27 Club (or Forever 27) is the name given to the group of highly influential stars who died at the young age of 27. Although there are dozens of artists in the 27 Club, the most notable are Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain. Most of the members of this club led somewhat troubled lives and the causes of their deaths were surrounded by a shroud of mystery. Indeed, investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain quickly leads to unanswered questions and strange abnormalities. No autopsies, no definitive causes of death and vague police reports seem to be the norm in these high-profile cases. In short, we can find in these untimely deaths everything required to generate “alternative theories” involving murder.</p>
<p>Amy Winehouse’s sadly appears to be a perfect fit for the Club. Although one might argue that she was not the iconic and revolutionary artist Hendrix and others were, she bore many similarities to them: A unique style, a big following, heavy drug and alcohol usage, a tendency for depression and other mental problems, a history of bad relationships and, finally (and most importantly), a bunch of unanswered questions surrounding her death.</p>
<h2>Mega-Rituals</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of stars dying at a young age in strange circumstances goes beyond the well-publicized 27 Club. While this Club is “reserved” to singers dying at the exact age of 27, many other types of artists have died in mysterious circumstances around the age of 30. Recently, the deaths of Heath Ledger (see the article about him entitled <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/the-imaginarium-of-doctor-parnassus-and-heath-ledgers-sacrifice/" target="_blank">“The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus” and Heath Ledger’s Sacrifice</a>) and Brittany Murphy followed the same pattern as those described above. Strangely enough, there often appears to be a media buildup around these figures before their death documenting their odd behaviour or personal problems. Were these deaths premeditated and part of some kind of sick ritual carried on by the occult-minded elite at the helms of the industry? Are charismatic stars being risen to fame in order to later sacrifice them, creating a worldwide mega-ritual? Is the wave of shock and grief surrounding these events harnessed in some way by high-powered occultists? These concepts might sound totally ridiculous to the average person but, to occult initiates, the magical potency of a human sacrifices has been recognized and documented by the rituals of many ancient civilizations. In <em>Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare</em>, author Michael A. Hoffman II writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The issue of controlling humanity with esoteric words and symbols encoded within a play, a media spectacular or a ritual is one of the most difficult for people to comprehend. That is why most people are viewed with utter contempt as “cowans”, “the profane”, “the gentiles” and “the goyim” by secret society initiates”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>About mega-rituals Hoffman writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“[Some murders] are ritual murders involving a cult protected by the U.S. government and the corporate media, with strong ties to the police.</em></p>
<p><em>Such killings are actually intricately choreographed ceremonies; performed first on a very intimate and secret scale, among the initiates themselves in order to program them, then on a grand scale, amplified incalculably by the electronic media.</em></p>
<p><em>In the end what we have is a highly symbolic, ritual working broadcast to millions of people, a Satanic inversion; a Black mass, where the “pews” are filled by the entire nation and through which humanity is brutalized and debased in this, the ‘Nigredo’ phase of the alchemical process.</em></p>
<p>- Michael A. Hoffman II, Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare</p></blockquote>
<p>In the 1940s, the French poet and theater director Antonin Artaud predicted the advent of occult mega-rituals in media. Artaud was an adept of  several forms of occultism and well-aware of the transformative powers of theatrical rituals: he created the infamous “Theater of Cruelty” that intended to profoundly change the audience. Regarding the processing of the Group Mind, Artaud wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Aside from the trifling witchcraft of country sorcerers, there are tricks of global hoodoo in which all alerted consciousnesses participate periodically … That is how strange forces are aroused and transported to the astral vault, to the dark dome which is composed above all of … the poisonous aggressiveness of the evil minds of most people … the formidable tentacular oppression of a kind of civic magic which will soon appear undisguised.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In Hollywood, the subjects of these rituals are often manipulated and mind controlled and their deaths are often “announced” in some way or another through symbolic works. In <em>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</em>, the last movie Heath Ledger appeared in, the theme of sacrifice is extremely important. In one important scene, we see the images of three celebrities who died young : Rudolph Valentino, James Dean and Princess Diana. Seeing these pictures, a woman says to Johnny Depp – who was one of Ledger’s replacements in the movie – “These people … they’re all dead”. Depp replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Yes … but immortal nevertheless. They won’t get old or fat. They won’t get sick or feeble. They are beyond fear because they are … forever young. They’re gods … and you can join them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He then added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your sacrifice must be pure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>These lines were intended to be said by Heath Ledger.</p>

<h2>The Case of Amy Winehouse</h2>
<p>At the time of writing this article, the exact cause of Winehouse’s death is yet to be determined (alcohol withdrawal is often cited). Like most strange celebrity deaths, the public will probably be given a vague explanation involving drugs or alcohol. And, like most strange celebrity deaths, some odd facts will surface, contradicting the “official” version of the cause of the death, causing rumours, speculations and alternative versions.</p>
<p>There are already witnesses who described strange happenings shortly before her death. In this news article, Winehouse’s neighbour claimed that there was “screaming, howling and some kind of drum beating” coming from her house the night she died.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Amy Winehouse death: Neighbour in Camden heard ‘screaming and howling’</h4>
<p>One of her neighbours said he is convinced she died in the early hours of Friday because he heard screaming. “I think something happened that night. It sounded like some weird sexual game. There was screaming and howling.” The man, who would not be named, said he was woken by the sound at around 2am that night. “It just sounded really weird and my son said he heard some kind of drum beating.”</p>
<p>This afternoon he heard one of Winehouse’s friends crying in the house, and realised she was dead. He believes a friend left her at home after a night out, and returned this afternoon to find her body. “She’s been quite low-profile and that’s why, when I heard these sounds – screaming – I thought it was unlike her. “I said to my son ‘Maybe she’s taken a bad drug’.”</p>
<p>He said he saw her about three weeks ago being helped into the house by her minders, and was unable to walk at 10am. “She couldn’t walk, she could hardly put one foot in front of the other.” Her cat, Sky, would come into his house for food and to sleep, he said.</p>
<p>Local restaurant owner Ze Silva, 56, said Winehouse would come in as regularly as twice a week. She saw her last Tuesday and said she had stopped drinking. “She had nothing to drink. She said to me ‘Darling, don’t give me any alcohol, I’m not drinking any more’. “She was normal. She would speak to everyone, have pictures taken with the kids, give autographs to the kids. “She was a good girl, I’m very sad.”</p>
<p>Winehouse would go to the restaurant, A Baia, to play snooker with her bodyguards and would send them to get her takeaway fried breakfasts. Flowers, teddies and candles had been left next to the police tape blocking off Camden Square. One card read: “You will not be forgotten by Camden. We all love you and will continue to love you. Your legend lives on.”</p>
<p>- London 24, <a href="http://www.london24.com/news/amy_winehouse_death_neighbour_in_camden_heard_screaming_and_howling_1_972931" target="_blank">Amy Winehouse death: Neighbour in Camden heard ‘screaming and howling’</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This leads us to the most important question: was Amy Winehouse’s death a murder or, perhaps, a ritual sacrifice? Was she under mind control and offed by her handlers? Is her death simply a result of exposure to a debased industry?</p>
<p>After Winehouse’s death singer Kelly Clarkson tweeted a rather poignant message regarding this matter.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><em>“I heard the news about Amy Winehouse. I’m incredibly sad. I didn’t know her but I met her a few times and got to hear her sing before she blew up. She was a beautiful and talented girl. I’m angry. What a waste of a gifted person. What a shame she saw no hope and continued living her life in that manor. I have been that low emotionally and mentally and that is overwhelming. I keep asking myself why some of us are spared and the others are made examples. I’m very angry and sad. I don’t know why it’s bothering me so much. Sometimes I think this job will be the death of us all, or at least the emotional death of us all. Maybe that is why as a little kid in sunday school I learned that God didn’t want false gods or idols. I thought it was terribly selfish of God as a child but I think I get it now. He didn’t want us following people or things that are imperfect and not so much for the followers but for the gods and/or idols who will never be what everyone wishes or needs them to be because we are made imperfect. He knew we wouldn’t be able to handle the pressure, the shame, the glory, or the power the spotlight brings. I am distraught. I am also extremely grateful and thankful for the people who love me and support me. Without such amazing friends and family who knows where I’d be. My thoughts and prayers are with her friends and family. I am so sorry for your loss. I pray for peace in your hearts.”</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Thrown From the Freedom Train?</h2>

<em>A prophetic 2008 sculpture of Amy Winehouse called &#8220;The Only Good Rock Star is a Dead Rock Star&#8221;. It depicts Amy Winehouse shot in the head and laying on the floor lifeless. Next to her is creepy Minnie Mouse mask, which, as stated in several other articles, can represent Illuminati mind control (although the sculptor claimed that the masked referred to the infamous video of Winehouse playing with baby mice).</em></p>
</div>
<p>In Fritz Springmeier’s <a href="http://knowledgefiles.com/categories/mind-control/the-illuminati-formula-to-create-an-undetectable-total-mind-controlled-slave/" target="_blank">The Illuminati Formula to Create a Mind Control Slave</a>, it is stated about mind control slaves that:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The programmers/masters program them with the expectation that they will be “thrown from the freedom train” when they get to age 30. (Freedom Train is the code word for the Monarch trauma-based mind control. To be thrown from the Freedom Train means to be killed.)”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Victims of mind control often die at a young age due to several reasons. First, according to trauma-based mind control experts, the torment, torture and control exerted on victims cannot be sustained indefinitely during adulthood. At one point, often around the age of 30, programming wears off, causing the victims to regain some lucidity. This contact with reality often traumatic, causing in the victims to be severely depressed, to show symptoms of mental disorders such as MPD (multiple personality disorders) and the consumption hard drugs and alcohol. When slaves (especially those that are influential) stop responding to programming and begin displaying erratic and unpredictable behaviour, they are often “thrown from the freedom train”.</p>
<p>Some victims with exceptionally strong wills and character manage to free themselves from the bonds of mind control (to a certain extent). To prevent them from “speaking out”, they are often found and “thrown off the freedom train” also.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“If a slave doesn’t comply or needs to be thrown from the Freedom Train they can become a useable statistic. Simply trigger them to murder and then watch the police gun them down. The NWO gains one more statistic and another case to scare the public into accepting gun control.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Was Winehouse under mind control and was she “thrown from the freedom train”? Difficult to say. She clearly displayed the typical symptoms of an “industry victim” and some her personal relations (notably Blake Fielder-Civil) appear to have played the role of “handler” (similar to Mariah Carey’s relation with Tommy Mottola and the late Anna-Nicole Smith’s relation with Howard K. Stern). There are several levels of mind control and Winehouse might not have underwgone the entire Monarch programming process. However, simply placing an already vulnerable person in music industry’s toxic environment and getting the celebrity machine in motion, complete with constant media harassment, is enough trauma to induce the metal instability that clears the way for mind control.</p>
<p>Despite her success, Winehouse never was an “industry pawn” like other acts discussed on this site. Her unwillingness (or incapability) to “fit the mold” might have been a cause of her demise. Winehouse’s goddaughter and protege Dionne Bromfield appears to fit that mold perfectly.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although it is difficult to know the exact cause of Amy Winehouse’s death, her case is certainly not unique. There is, in fact, a pattern that appears to repeat itself when looking at the early deaths of young celebrities. If one were to compare the lives and the circumstances leading to the death of these stars, one would notice important similarities and then realize that important “pieces of the puzzle” are often missing from official stories. From humble beginnings, these stars reach a great level of popularity. However, at one point, something goes terribly wrong and a drugged-filled, humiliating downfall almost inevitably occurs. Is the missing piece of the puzzle this thing that goes terribly wrong? If these artists are not a direct result of Monarch mind control, a “handler” figure nevertheless exists in their entourage, manipulating and influencing them towards a self-destructive behaviour. The media often adds to and amplifies the star’s problems, portraying them as disturbed drug addicts. When their death is announced, the world is shocked, yet not-so-surprised. Drugs and alcohol are, as always, the perfect scapegoats. As people say … “case closed”.</p>
<p>Why is our popular culture obsessed with sex and death, where rising stars, who capture the love of millions, get shot down? In an industry permeated with occult symbolism, run by people and organizations who believe in occult powers, is it possible that actual occult rituals are being carried out? Is the collective shock caused by the announcement of a celebrity death being used as ritual psychodrama meant to imprint the collective consciousness? Of course, not all celebrity deaths are results of rituals any many of them occur because, you know, stuff happens. One thing however remains constant: The deaths are symptomatic of the dark reality of show-business, which is toxic on many levels. To be caught up in this realm and attempting to exit it is, to cite a Winehouse’s song,  <em>Some Unholy War</em>.</p>

			<p><strong>Less than 24 hours after President Obama stated:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/PalinBachmann3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/PalinBachmann2.jpg" alt="" /></a>“The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states, with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine. The borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states. The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves, and reach their potential, in a sovereign and contiguous state.” [1]</p>
<p>Presidential candidate, Tea Party congresswoman Michele Bachmann launched 150,000 robo-calls to residents in Iowa and South Carolina on May 19th accusing Obama of not standing up for Israel.</p>
<p>In her recent speech at the “Faith &amp; Freedom Conference” held in D.C., Bachmann termed Obama’s call for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict based on Israel’s 1967 boundaries and mutually agreed land swaps “shocking ” and she followed up by buying ads on Jewish websites reiterating her message.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, Bachmann worked on a kibbutz in Israel near to Beersheva, one of over 500 Palestinian villages and towns that Israel ethnically cleansed beginning in 1948.</p>
<div>
<a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/palestinan_map.jpg"><img title="palestinan_map" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/palestinan_map.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="408" /></a></p>
</div>
<p>In 1986, Bachmann received a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor">J.D.</a> degree from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Roberts_University">Oral Roberts University</a>, a cross-denominational/non-denominational Christian university that is part of a movement of individual, historically mainstream congregations who have adopted beliefs and practices similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostals">Pentecostals</a>, which includes a wide range of different theologies, such as The NAR/New Apostolic Reformation.</p>
<p>The NAR is a religious movement of elites and regular people guided by an entire genre of books, texts, videos and other media. Among NAR adherents, is Sarah Palin and the NAR is one of the largest movements in America that nobody knows of due to the dearth of investigative reporting on the intersection of faith and politics.</p>
<p>NAR videos “demonstrate the taking control of communities and nations through large networks of ‘prayer warriors’ whose spiritual warfare is used to expel and destroy the demons that cause societal ills. Once the territorial demons, witches, and generational curses are removed, the ‘born-again’ Christians in the videos take control of society…Leaders in the NAR movement refer to themselves as ‘apostles.’</p>
<p>“Along with her entire family, Sarah Palin was re-baptized at twelve at the Wasilla Assembly of God in Wasilla, Alaska and she attended the church from the time she was ten until 2002: over two and 1/2 decades. Sarah Palin’s extensive pattern of association with the Wasilla Assembly of God has continued nearly up to the day she was picked by Senator John McCain as a vice-presidential running mate.</p>
<p>“Palin has also been blessed, or ‘anointed’, by an African cleric, prominent in the Third Wave movement, who has repeatedly visited the Wasilla Assembly of God and claims to have effected positive, dramatic social change in a Kenyan town by driving out a ‘spirit of witchcraft.’</p>
<p>“The Wasilla Assembly of God church is deeply involved with both Third Wave activities and theology…The Third Wave is a revival of the theology of the Latter Rain tent revivals of the 1950s and 1960s led by William Branham and others. It is based on the idea that in the end times there will be an outpouring of supernatural powers on a group of Christians that will take authority over the existing church and the world. The believing Christians of the world will be reorganized under the Fivefold Ministry and the church restructured under the authority of Prophets and Apostles and others anointed by God. The young generation will form ‘Joel’s Army’ to rise up and battle evil and retake the earth for God…” [2]</p>
<p>Jesus called politicians foxes and with Bachmann and Palin being touted as presidential material, the issue of faith in politics has never been more deadly.</p>
<p>As Don Hewitt advised: “Tell me a story. It’s that easy” I offer this one to my sister and brother Americans, in particular those who claim to be Christian:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WZCYim4kkI" target="_blank">Dear Christian: Resurrect This and Know That..</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WZCYim4kkI"></a><br />

<p>On March 20, 2006, I traveled from the Little Town of Bethlehem: Occupied Territory to the Mount of Beatitudes in Israel. This awe inspiring site sits above the shimmering Sea of Galilee where Jesus preached the Sermon on the Mount, and I ended up delivering my own Sermon on that Mount! <a href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=819&amp;Itemid=195" target="_blank">Read more…</a><a title="Sermon on The Mount" href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=819&amp;Itemid=195" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>Four Franciscan Sisters, one each from Syria, Jordan, Malta and Italy care for the shrine and the pilgrim guests at the Hospice Center where I spent two nights and a day of silent reflection after nine days on a Sabeel Reality tour through occupied Palestine.</p>
<p>At dinner a Catholic Pentecostal from Scotland introduced himself and asked me why I was there and what church I was from.</p>
<p>I responded that I have Irish Roman Catholic, Polish Jew and Ukrainian DNA and my rock is The Beatitudes.</p>
<p>He looked even more perplexed when I told him I had come to the Mount of Beatitudes to decompress and reflect upon my nine days in Occupied Territory. I asked him if he were aware of the work of Sabeel, the Palestinian Christian liberation theology organization founded by a 1948 refugee, which promotes a theology of liberation, based on justice, peace, non-violence and reconciliation with all people regardless of faith path or nationality.</p>
<p>He sternly admonished me; “God gave this land to the Jews! The Bible never mentions Palestine, and that is that! God gave this land to the Jews and that is that!”</p>
<p>I responded just as fervently that the Palestinian Christians are the descendants of those who first followed Jesus and they have been denied inalienable human rights by the Israeli government. I told him the Christians in the Holy Land have shrunk from 20% of the total population to less than 1.3% since 1948 and if things don’t change soon, there will be no Christians left in the land where Christ promised that it is the peacemakers who are the children of God.</p>
<p>He sputtered, “But the Jews have suffered! God gave this land to the Jews and that is that!”</p>
<p>This really got my Irish up and I retorted, “Yes they did because good people did nothing for far too long, and now the oppressed have become the oppressors. In the 21st century good people are unaware, ignoring or are in total denial of the injustices Israel gets away with in the so called Holy Land. And the Hebrew prophets, such as Micah reminded the people of what the Lord requires: To be just, to be merciful and to walk humbly with your God!”</p>
<p>I could NOT shut up although I knew that that Scotsman was trying to get away from me, but, I was on a tear and barely took a breath as I told him that instead of staying in Israel for his entire visit, he should go and witness life in the occupied territories; go and see the effects of The Wall on his spirit and see what it has done to the Palestinian economy. I told him he should go and tour some of the Bethlehem refugee camps and see the ruins of all the uncompensated home demolitions. I brought it on home by telling him that I also doubt that God was ever in the real estate business!</p>
<p>His eyes had bugged out and his mouth had dropped open while the torrent of words spewed out of me. After I finally shut up, he stammered, “But there is suffering everywhere!”</p>
<p>“Yes there is and Christ always stood up for the poor and the oppressed. And he told us what ever we do or do not do for the least and the outcast; we do it or not unto God.”</p>
<p>He shook his head and turned and walked quickly away and never again looked my way.</p>
<p>Nobody else spoke to me the rest of the evening or the next day. That was fine with me, for I was listening to the voice within and I kept hearing Luke 23:34:</p>
<p>“Father forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.”</p>
<p>But when you know and if you are of good will, you must do something and as education is the way to compassion and compassion is the way to change, so I persist to try and Wake Up the Bachmann’s and Palin’s of America many of whom have been misled into accepting the ideology of Christian Zionism as IF it were theologically sound!</p>
<p><strong>What is Christian Zionism?</strong></p>
<p>Christian Zionism is an extremist Christian movement, which supports the claims of those who believe that the State of Israel should take control of all of the land currently disputed between Palestinians and Israelis. It views the creation and expansion of the modern state of Israel as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy toward the second coming of Jesus.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is a modern theological and political movement that embraces the most extreme ideological positions of Zionism, thereby becoming detrimental to a just peace within Palestine and Israel. The Christian Zionist program provides a worldview where the Gospel is identified with the ideology of empire, colonialism and militarism. In its extreme form, it laces an emphasis on apocalyptic events leading to the end of history rather than living Christ’s love and justice today.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Christian Zionist connection with the Holy Land?</strong></p>
<p>Believing that God fights on the side of Israel, Christian Zionists call for the unqualified support for the most extreme political positions. They do not have eyes to see or ears to hear their sisters and brothers in Christ, or cousins in the family of Father Abraham who are caught in the crossfire of the military minded.</p>
<p>Christian Zionist spokes persons have also attributed Hurricane Katrina to God’s wrath over America’s failure to stop Israel from “disengaging” from Gaza in 2005, although Israel has never ceased their total control over air, land and sea borders!</p>
<p>They also consistently oppose any moves towards a solution to the conflict, which would validate the political aspirations of both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p><strong>Who Supports Christian Zionism?</strong></p>
<p>Christian Zionism has significant support within American Protestant fundamentalists, and number between 10 and 20 million. Its reach is broad, by virtue of its favorite themes related to the “End Times” and an Israel-fixated Christian media.</p>
<p>Christian Zionism is both a political movement and a way of mis-interpreting current events. Its focus on Israel and the Middle East is an ideology and a movement. Its promoters share many beliefs but are not organized through any one institution.</p>
<p>Throughout history Christians have at times twisted scripture to justify violence: for the Crusades, for Antisemitism, and for slavery.</p>
<p>Too often the Church has been slow to respond to these biblical distortions and with disastrous results.</p>
<p>Today Christian Zionists – particularly those with dispensationalist leanings – are well organized and although their motives are couched in terms of compassion toward the Jewish people they base their theology on literal readings of scripture.</p>
<p>The political agenda of territorial expansion advocated by Christian Zionists has given rise to the brutal injustices against Palestinians, which fuels the fires of militancy in the Middle East.</p>
<p>While Jewish Zionism began with the hope that all Jewish people would have a safe and peaceful dwelling place, these corruptors of the gospel Christ preached, adhere to a 200 year old convoluted interpretation of disparate scriptures that they have chosen to weave together to support their fear based judgmental narrow minded doctrine.</p>
<p>This heretical theology of Premellenial Dispensation worships a god of Armageddon and not the God of love, forgiveness and compassion that Jesus/The Prince of Peace modeled even while being nailed to a cross.</p>
<p>The “Left Behind” series of fiction is the epitome of what millennium of theologians have always understood to be what the term anti-Christ is truly about</p>
<p>The term “Antichrist” only appears five times in the Bible, but a cult not based on sound theology has created an urban legend that seeks Armageddon.</p>
<p>The term “Antichrist” never appears in John’s Revelation or Daniel, two disparate works of literature written three centuries apart and under very different circumstances, yet the Left Behinder’s weave them together.</p>
<p>The small texts that mention the “Antichrist” were written to attack the Gnostic understanding of whom Christ was. A Gnostic relies on intuition and not on dogma and doctrine. Gnostic’s were most certainly free spirits and most all of the writings we have about Gnostics, have been the attacks upon them. That all changed when the Nag Hamadi Library was translated and published, for what had been deemed heretical by those in power in the fourth century can now be read in most every language. <a href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=824&amp;Itemid=195">Read more…</a></p>
<p>The theology promoted in the Left Behind fiction is a theology based on fear and punishment.</p>
<p>These misinformed Christians worship a punitive father as God. They do not have eyes to see that nature is God’s primary temple, and war the greatest abomination.</p>
<p>The theology of the fictional “Left Behind” series is the epitome of the spirit of the anti-Christ: which is the evil within ones own heart that leads one to fear “the other” and compels them to violence.</p>
<p>According to Christ, to be his follower, one must do what the Father requires. The Hebrew prophet Micah summed it up best: “What does the Lord require? He has already told you o’man: Be Just, Be Merciful and walk humbly with your God.” -Micah 6:8:</p>
<p>To be just is to be fair and reasonable. To be merciful means to treat all people the way we want to be treated. To be humble is knowing oneself; the good and the evil, for both cut through every human heart.</p>
<p>Jesus taught that the only way to resist evil is with good and he modeled that one must always work for peaceful resolutions, even to the point of returning violence with compassion and forgiveness.</p>
<p>No religion owns God and no church owns Jesus, who was never a Christian, for that term was not even coined until three decades after he walked the earth.</p>
<p>Jesus was a social justice radical revolutionary nonviolent Palestinian devout Jewish road warrior who rose up and challenged the job security of the temple priests by teaching the people no need to pay the priests for ritual baths or sacrificing livestock to be OK with God; for God already LOVES you just as you are.</p>
<p>Christianity and this republic were founded by rebels, revolutionaries and dissidents. Jesus called politicians foxes and I take that as a warning to US that when religion rules politics instead of guiding ethics and morality, we the people for justice, peace, equality and true democracy get screwed.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/POPEJOAN3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/POPEJOAN2.jpg" alt="Feminism" /></a><em></em><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s a God-shaped vacuum in every heart</em>.&#8221; Blaise Pascal, 17th century philosopher</p>
<p>In 1993, over 2000 &#8220;Christian&#8221; women prayed, <em>&#8220;We invoke Sophia, Divine Wisdom &#8230; let her speak and bless us throughout our days</em>.&#8221; This was at a Minneapolis Re-Imagining Conference partially funded by Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist and Lutheran denominations. The agenda: Re-imagining Jesus, themselves, their sexuality, and their world. They wanted a new god with a feminine face. [1]</p>
<p>These seekers evidently were not satisfied with their churches or their relationships with God and they opened themselves to new experiences to fill that &#8220;&#8230;vacuum in every heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feminists are &#8220;re-imagining&#8221; God in their own image. Calling on the goddess Sophia, the Greek word equals Wisdom, or Mother God, or any other deviation from the masculine image of Father God.</p>
<p>Old paganish idolatry is nothing new. There is a vast array of spiritual condiments to choose from when there is no higher authority — except one&#8217;s self. These women and churches are choosing from a vast array of various pagan philosophies, witchcraft tricks and ancient rituals along with pagan goddesses of old.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;God is going to change. We women . . . will change the world so much that He won&#8217;t fit anymore</em>.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p>Many mainline churches have gradually opened their doors wider to accommodate the moral relativism and liberal tolerance of modern America&#8217;s decadent culture. What happened? Feminism. These churches are involved in a process, transforming patriarchal biblical churches to idol-worshipping matriarchal churches, from God-centeredness to human-centeredness.</p>
<p><strong>Churches and Families</strong></p>
<p>Radical feminists issued a 1971 &#8220;Declaration of Feminism&#8221; which states, <em>&#8220;The end of the institution of marriage is a necessary condition for the liberation of women.&#8221;</em> Along with choosing whatever they want to believe, feminists have advocated the end of marriage and family.</p>
<p>Feminist Gloria Steinem, editor of Ms. Magazine, has said: <em>&#8220;By the year 2000 we will, I hope, raise our children to believe in human potential, not God</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Historically, churches have been comprised of generational families, husbands, wives, children, grandparents, etc. But the once sacred vows of marriage are no longer upheld as God&#8217;s commands and blessings between a man and woman. &#8220;Christian&#8221; divorces are common. And children have become inconveniences for many couples or just possessions to be discarded when no longer wanted.</p>
<p>The effects have been devastating as these denominations decline and grown children accept the philosophies of the world, seeing no need for God and church.</p>
<p><strong>Women Leading God&#8217;s Churches?</strong></p>
<p>Women started making inroads into church leadership by claiming equality and abandoning their God-given roles.</p>
<p>When we see women pastors standing in the pulpit, we have to wonder, what happened? to the men and male leadership? Thirty years of being emasculated and undermined by women striving for an equality they already had, men have ceded to women. Men have abandoned their God-given roles.</p>
<p>Cultural and religious change always come in incremental steps. Feminists taking on the mantle of church leadership have led churches to take one more step — ordaining homosexual ministers. What&#8217;s next — transgendered males preaching?</p>
<p>Humans don&#8217;t require much influence to sidetrack them from following God. The entertainment-bent culture and educational indoctrination have certainly done a good job for the feminists.</p>
<p>No wonder some churches are no longer fit for God&#8217;s remnant of Bible-believing people.</p>
<p><strong>What about the Bible?</strong></p>
<p>One result of the feminist influence in churches is that people may not hear sound Biblical teaching. They may have one or more Bibles at home, but God&#8217;s Word sits on a shelf, unread and unstudied. God&#8217;s wisdom and plan for mankind within its pages is rejected and not given any authority in their lives.</p>
<p>Feminists and liberal scholars have discarded parts or all of the Bible, but specifically what God says about His roles for women and men. These churches don&#8217;t believe the Bible to be inerrant, the work of the Holy Spirit through men, nor solely the Word of God.</p>
<p>They uphold a false theology that goes back to believing a lie in the Garden of Eden and the consequences: God&#8217;s curse on both men and women.</p>
<p>As noted by Pastor John MacArthur&#8217;s Bible teaching on Radical Feminism:<em>&#8220;Typically fallen women want to take charge and you have a (fallen) man who wants to dominate in an insensitive and overbearing way</em>. &#8230; he paraphrased Genesis 3:16, <em>&#8216;From now on, her desire will be to rule over you and you will subdue her</em>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>In ejecting the Bible, God and Jesus Christ from their churches, they &#8220;have deceived themselves and the Truth is not in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <em>&#8220;in the days of Noah&#8221;</em> — there really is <em>&#8220;nothing new under the sun</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>[This series of articles have barely touched on the devastation to America of rejection of God and our pending demise through liberalism and Feminism which have permeated all social discourse and political institutions.]</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/cross-church3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/cross-church2.jpg" alt="" /></a>I received this email several weeks ago: Please listen <a href="http://www.morningstartv.com/oak-initiative/marxism-america">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is encouraging to see the Charismatic community waking to reality but I am disturbed that it did not happen years ago and wish their analysis contained an effective depth.  Although he conducted the interview Rick Joyner is not shown on the video.  He is a Charismatic leader who heads up Morning Star Ministries.  Lt. General W. G. (Jerry) Boykin is a retired army officer who is a Christian.  He speaks with convincing sincerity.  These are both well intentioned Christian men and my criticism is not meant to be personal.</p>
<p>Charismatics are usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism">Dispensational</a>; they disdain God’s Law.  In providing a solution to the problems outlined in this video there is no mention of God’s Word, His Law, or his pattern of government.</p>
<p>Condemning the cruelty of Sharia law they offer the human law of our Constitution as a solution.   General Boykin claims to believe Muslims have the right to worship in America as long as they forsake Islamic legal standards.  Legal standards are what gives Islam teeth and makes Christianity toothless.  Law forms the religious base of society; if the legal structure is a product of human minds the society is humanistic.  If the legal structure is derived from the Law given by God to Moses it is in accord with our Christian God.  Bereft of law, today’s pietistic Christianity is unable to create righteousness.</p>
<p>We do not tend to think of humanism as pietistic but worship of the mind of the creature is as ethereal as worship of the Holy Spirit; both lack a proper anchor.  The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is a “jealous God” but in defiance of His character General Boykin and most American Christians support Constitutional religious plurality. Antinomian Christianity is a false religion and its supporters are seeking to supplant one false religion with another.</p>
<p>Boykin deplores the advancement of Marxism but because his religion is stunted he is unable to offer a religious solution but must instead resort to a political alternative.  He speaks about censorship in the media but by completely ignoring the overwhelming Zionist agenda that pervades it, he makes resistance impossible by missing the crucial “why”.  He claims ministers have a right to condemn homosexuality and same sex marriage but fails to mention that Constitutional government lacks moral absolutes.  He ignores God’s Law which is the foundation for condemnation of homosexuality and same sex marriage.  He does not understand that righteousness, freedom, and justice, (the progenitors of peace) are impossible without the moral absolutes of God’s Law. By contending that Islam is not a religion but a totalitarian way of life he confirms a lack of understanding of the function of immutable religious law.  All law is force but the force of humanistic law is subject to the whims of the human mind; it is terrifyingly dangerous.  Like all antinomian Christians, Rick Joyner and Jerry Boykin seek a humanistic religious environment where they can proscribe God with their own opinions.  They are humanists!</p>
<p>Since the religion of Joiner and Boykin is Dispensational they would contend that the Law God gave to Moses is anachronistic and no longer applies to the Christian era.  This conclusion allows them to insert human law and malign Christianity with humanism.  Nevertheless, all Christian Bibles provide the death penalty for murder, striking a parent, kidnapping, adultery, incest, bestiality, sodomy, rape of a virgin, witchcraft, incorrigible criminality, blasphemy, worship of false gods, breach of court decisions, and failure to restore a pledge or bailment.  The penalties for these infractions are: burning, stoning, hanging, and the sword.  (Scripture references are available on request)</p>
<p>Boykin incites Christians with the hot buttons of Sharia law, cutting off hands and stoning, but fails to acknowledge the Law God gives us in His Word.  These men claim to believe the Bible but in reality they pick and choose what portions they will believe and what portions they will reject.  They override the express intentions of their Creator.</p>
<p>It is God’s Law, Law contained in His Word that Rick Joyner, General Boykin, and most Americans, Christian and non-Christian, find “disgusting”.  It is the Law God gave to Moses, the Law that He used to judge the behavior of His Chosen People; Law given by our God Who never changes; who is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow; it is this precious Law that Christians often find “disgusting”!  The Law of the One True God is the only offensive weapon that will defeat Islam and tyrannical government.  Unlike Sharia law, God’s Law is not to be imposed on society.  It is intended for God’s chosen people and for those who choose to dwell with them.  It is not to be imposed on other nations. God’s Law is to be applied with mercy and He has provided His own Son as redemption for those that fall under its penalty.</p>
<p>Islam is the world’s fastest growing religion because it has a world view, it designates a specific way of life and promises rewards for obedience.  Christianity is waning because it has been gutted and its members have been blinded.</p>
<p>In many mainline denominational churches small groups gather each Sunday to discuss the Scripture.  The process involves filtering the Word of God through the evil brains of His created beings.  Various human opinions are welcome. Good, solid citizens have been attending these churches and participating in these groups for their entire lives.  To some extent they are social gatherings that allow for recognition of each participant who often leaves feeling he or she has satisfied a Christian responsibility.  Sometimes lost souls are brought to Christ and guided into the same pattern as their leaders. Their lives may be drastically changed, they may give to charities and spend time helping the poor but they have no understanding of the Will of the God they profess to worship and their efforts may have local impact but, lacking a vibrant world view, they are unable to compete in the world arena.</p>
<p>There has never been a nation that needed God’s Law as badly as The United States of America.  We have a perennial famine of consensus.  Every citizen is an individual island of ideas and opinions.  When there is consensus it is usually around a false premise.  A majority of our citizens believe in the political process and support political candidates as a solution to our problems.  Most seek to bind politics to the United States Constitution.  Charley Reese <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18568.htm">famously wrote</a> that 545 (One hundred senators, 435 congressmen, one president and nine Supreme Court justices) people are responsible for the conditions in the United States – they are all politicians.  He is correct but the problem is not politics or obedience to the Constitution; the problem is disobedience to God and to His Commandments.</p>
<p>There is widespread fear and hatred of Sharia law and of Muslims.  The irrational emotion behind this fear obliterates reality and makes it impossible to remind Americans that our government is the culprit for allowing them to enter our nation. Truth is Muslims are coming here because they can get free medical care, free groceries, and subsidized housing.  Christians need to understand that Christian Law, the Law Jesus claimed to fulfill, is very similar in both its requirements and its penalties to Shiria law and Shiria law is probably superior to the maze of humanistic laws that create massive, daily injustices in our courts and in the procedures used by our law enforcement personnel.  They need to understand that when they omit or condemn God’s Law they are condemning the Will of God, the Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We were not created to govern ourselves.   When humanists are in control the chaos of human opinion fosters the freedom robbing order of tyranny.   God created us to obey Him.  When we obey His Commandments we enjoy freedom; when we ignore His Commandments we become prisoners of imperialism.</p>

			<p><strong>Global Spiritual Communism&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/moloch3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/moloch2.jpg" alt="Moloch" /></a>From the time of this nation&#8217;s founding on through to the current era, the majority of Americans saw God as the Ultimate Authority, the Bible as their ultimate guidebook, and the Old and New Testament moral law as their highest principles.</p>
<p>In a commentary entitled, “Conservatives Begin to See the Light,”  Joseph Farah describes the ultimate principle&#8212;the ground of being&#8211; on which our nation was founded:</p>
<p>“That we are created in the image of God and are accountable to Him. Without that recognition, we are virtually incapable of self-government, which requires us to be able to distinguish right from wrong, as defined by God. God has created certain institutions for His purposes and for our benefit. Among these is marriage, the family and government. But any government that exceeds its limited authority or attempts to usurp the authority of God is unworthy of its power. Real conservatives believe in the tenets of the Declaration of Independence which explains that our rights descend from God—and that they come with responsibility as well.” (source: <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=263177" target="_blank">http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=263177</a>)</p>
<p>In other words, God the Father created all things Ex Nihilo (special creation). He is God, fallen man is not God. He is the Ultimate Authority, fallible power-hungry man is not. God is the Author of unchanging Universal Moral Law,  corruptible man is not. He created two sexes, male and female.  He did not create &#8220;gays,&#8221; lesbians, and transsexuals anymore than He created narcissists, braggarts, adulterers, liars, thieves, murderers and usurpers of His throne.  Ultimately, all of these compulsions and vices are the out-workings of fallen man&#8217;s perennial abuse of free will.</p>
<p>Because the transcendent, personal Creator is the  ground of being of all men, in other words  of man&#8217;s mind (i.e., conscience and ability to reason) and soul, He is therefore the ground of being of our unalienable rights.  Unalienable means, &#8220;from God, not from man.&#8221;  For instance, we are guaranteed freedom of conscience because all men do in fact have a conscience.</p>
<p>In short, the ground of being and/or the ultimate overarching principle on which America&#8217;s Constitutional Republic is founded is, &#8220;In the beginning God created&#8230;&#8221;   It is not imaginary spontaneous generation of something from nothing in tandem with  godless evolutionary conceptions  as scientistic materialist-monists, atheists in general, occult New Age  pantheist-monists and even some misguided Christians maintain.</p>
<p>Together, belief in the Biblical Creator and Christianity is the “glue” that has held America together&#8212;authoritatively, morally, nationally, culturally, and economically&#8211; since this nation&#8217;s founding.</p>
<p>Throughout history, no society&#8211;especially the most advanced&#8212;has existed without belief in  the true God or gods.   And where the people have lost faith in or otherwise willfully rejected their deity, the fate of that society has been death, generally at the hands of invading conquerors.</p>
<p>We cannot understand what has gone so terribly wrong in America until we see its’ social dissolution in this light, for by and large, contemporary Americans have turned their backs on God the Father.</p>
<p>In the hearts of such people, God is dead.  As a result, without the Divine &#8220;glue” to hold us together as a people, a culture, and a nation, America is coming undone.</p>
<p>America&#8217;s downward-spiraling social disintegration is clearly seen by the fact that increasing numbers of Americans are doing whatever they want to do so long as they can get away with it. Pathological lying has swept &#8220;honesty-is-the-best-policy&#8221; under the rug, lawlessness has all but overcome the Rule of Law, while amorality and sexual anarchy enforced by tolerance are today&#8217;s &#8220;new&#8221; commandments. In this climate of mindless license, cosmically-inflated egoism, covetousness, and hedonism, the Constitution has been transformed into  a magic lantern.   When rubbed just so the evil genie grants the “rights” and “privileges” desired by covetous, power-hungry, hedonistic  narcissists. Hence this latest outrage:</p>
<p>“Lawmakers in the state of California are proposing a law that would require schools to portray lesbians, homosexuals, transsexuals and those who have chosen other alternative sexual lifestyles as positive role models to children in all public schools there.” <a href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=262485#ixzz1DoqwYh00" target="_blank">http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=262485#ixzz1DoqwYh00</a></p>
<p><strong>Social Disintegration</strong></p>
<p>Sociologist Robert Nisbet defines social disintegration:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;social disintegration is really nothing more than the spectacle of a rising number of individuals playing fast and loose with other individuals in relationships of trust and responsibility.&#8221; (Whistleblower, America&#8217;s Gay Obsession, pp. 18, 38, 39)</p>
<p>In other words, in an amoral hedonistic society such as America has become, we can no longer trust the people we need to trust.   And now, as the &#8220;gay&#8221; newspaper, the Washington Blade triumphantly reports, high-profile conservatives:</p>
<p>&#8220;have taken the leadership role in achieving marriage equality.&#8221;  (ibid)</p>
<p>From Elizabeth Hasselbeck to solicitor general Ted Olsen, high profile conservatives are jumping onto the &#8220;gay&#8221; war-wagon.  S.E. Cupp, a young conservative Daily Caller columnist and frequent Fox News pundit goes so far as to say,</p>
<p>&#8220;Conservatism and gay rights are actually natural allies&#8230;&#8221;   (ibid)</p>
<p>However, support for sexual anarchy is Libertarianism, observed Kevin McCullough.  In his article, &#8220;Disrespectful Libertarians Hijack CPAC Poll&#8212;and Its Mission,&#8221; he says true Conservatives are not the same thing as Libertarians:</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is libertarians are the worst form of political affiliation in the nation. Combining the desire of economic greed, with the amoral desire to promote any behavior regardless of its cost to our culture is a stark departure from the intent of the Founding Fathers.&#8221;   &#8221; It is the libertarian in attendance that produced the free pornographic calendar passed out to attendees in 2010. It is the libertarians in attendance who openly promote the inclusion of groups like GOProud, largely as an attempt to silence groups who would speak in strong support of traditional moral values. It is the libertarian in attendance who slandered President George Bush, by claiming his appreciation for the Constitution was best summed up as a &#8220;damn piece of paper.&#8221; It is the libertarian in attendance that proclaimed the war to prevent terrorists from regathering strength and coming after our homeland as &#8220;illegal.&#8221; And it is the libertarian in attendance that eschewed, booed, cajoled and screamed &#8220;war criminal&#8221; to Vice President Dick Cheney, a man who served his country with commitment and still attempts to help the world understand the threat of the radical Islamic element devising plans to eliminate us and our allies.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.patriotactionnetwork.com/forum/topic/show?id=2600775:Topic:3207785&amp;xgs=1&amp;xg_source=msg_share_topic" target="_blank">http://www.patriotactionnetwork.com/forum/topic/show?id=2600775:Topic:3207785&amp;xgs=1&amp;xg_source=msg_share_topic</a>)<br />

<strong> Satanic Black Wing Over America</strong></p>
<p>Speaking through his character the Madman, the dark prophet Nietzsche announced the &#8220;death of God.&#8221;  Dubbing himself the Antichrist, Nietzsche proclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest recent event&#8212;that &#8216;God is dead,&#8217; that the belief in the Christian God has ceased to be believable&#8212;is even now beginning to cast its first shadows over Europe; however, few really understood &#8221; what has really happened here, &#8220;and what must collapse now that this belief has been undermined&#8212;all that was built upon it, leaned on it, grew into it; for example, our whole European morality.&#8221;  (False Dawn, Lee Penn, p. 433)</p>
<p>Like a vast ebon wing, the &#8220;death of God&#8221; overshadows America with an impenetrable shroud of practical atheism, irrational hostility and outright hatred toward Christians, Christian symbols, traditions, and holidays, as well as the America of the Founders, for in the words of Nietzsche, all of this &#8220;must collapse now that this belief has been undermined.&#8221;  Wittingly or unwittingly, high profile conservatives are aiding and abetting the collapse of America.</p>
<p>By rejecting God,  increasing numbers of Americans have themselves become in essence, little gods.  In practical terms, this means that America is no longer a monotheistic society but a polytheistic one in much the same way that India is with its&#8217; millions of gods and goddesses.  And each little god and his cult followers (special rights groups) demand their &#8220;rights&#8221; according to what they most covet.   Will-to-power, or might-makes-right has become the way of life here.</p>
<p>In this light, Obama is but a little god-man who has managed to crawl atop the writhing anthill comprised of untold numbers of other god-men, goddesses and their respective cults.  From atop the anthill, the victorious Obama and other like-minded god-men force their will and way upon the rest.    Likewise, gods and goddesses whose wicked fantasy is a sexually-perverted &#8220;anything goes&#8221;  utopia are forcing their abominable lusts upon the rest of us simply because they too can get away with doing so.</p>
<p>America will eventually collapse, and out of its ashes will arise a global Moloch state.</p>
<p><strong>Revival of the Moloch State</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;While relatively little is known of Moloch, much more is known of the concept of divine kingship, the king as god, and the god as king, as the divine-human link between heaven and earth.  The god-king represented man on a higher (<em>evolved, naturally selected</em>) scale, man ascended, and the worship of such a god, i.e., of such a Baal, was the assertion of the continuity of heaven and earth.  It was the belief that all being was one being (<em>materialist-pantheist monism</em>), and the god therefore was an ascended man on that scale of being.  The power manifested in the political order was thus a manifestation or apprehension and seizure of divine power (<em>through the conceptual murder of God)</em>.  It represented the triumph of a man (<em>i.e., Hegel, Marx, Darwin, Freud, Lenin and Hitler</em>)  and of his people (<em>i.e., Bolsheviks, Marxists and National Socialists</em>).  Moloch worship was thus a political religion (<em>i.e., Marxism, Progressivism, Fascism, occult New Age</em>)&#8230;.Moloch worship was thus state worship.  The state was the true and ultimate order, and religion was a department of the state.  The state claimed total jurisdiction over man (<em>necessitating mind-control, re-education, concentration camps, brainwashing</em>); it was therefore entitled to total sacrifice.&#8221; (Rousas Rushdoony cited in &#8220;The Antichrist,&#8221; by Vincent P. Miceli, S.J., pp. 246, 247; emphasis added)</p>
<p>When the true God is banished from man&#8217;s society, into the resulting vacuum rush new gods, peculiar ideas,  the dehumanization of mankind, strange practices and staggering cruelty.</p>
<p>Having accepted their own godhood, countless numbers of contemporary Americans are now rushing headlong into the occult, that is, Wicca, Satanism, goddess worship, transcendental meditation, channeling, and ghost-hunting for example.   These spiritist activities bring about a revival of the politics of ancient paganism.  This means the development of a divine totalitarian state based on a Hermetic-theology of &#8220;as above, so below,&#8221; that is, on the denial of the Creator-creature distinction.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Ye can be as God&#8230;&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The Moloch state simply represents the supreme effort of man to command the future, to predestine the world, and to be as God.  Lesser efforts, divination, spirit-questing, magic and witchcraft are equally anathema to God.  All represent efforts to have the future on other than God&#8217;s terms, to have a future apart from and in defiance of God.  They are assertions that the world is not of God but of brute factuality, and that man can somehow master the world and the future by going directly to the raw materials thereof.&#8221;  (ibid)</p>
<p><strong>Human Sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>The pagan theocratic state freely took the lives of its children&#8211;and adults for that matter&#8211;as sacrifices to the god of the state, Moloch for instance: <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/m/moloch.html" target="_blank">http://www.pantheon.org/articles/m/moloch.html</a></p>
<p>The Soviet Union was a totalitarian secularized-pagan state.  Its so-called &#8220;scientific socialism&#8221; was grounded in  evolutionary materialist-monism.  In pursuit of its&#8217; &#8220;heaven on earth,&#8221; the Soviet State murdered over 60,000,000 men, women, and children.</p>
<p>Fyodor Dostoevsky foresaw the eventual failure of the Soviet Union and predicted that the devilish rebels against God would be forced to turn to the Devil and his minions if they were to finally realize their dream of a global Tower of Babel.</p>
<p><strong>The Green Tower of Babel</strong></p>
<p>Still under construction worldwide but complete in New York City there exists an occult temple complex consisting of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the Temple of Understanding, the UN and in particular its&#8217; pyramid-shaped meditation room, and Lucis Trust, originally named Lucifer Publishing, repository of the &#8220;Ageless Wisdom Teachings,&#8221; or revelations from spirits.</p>
<p>Note: Edith Kermit Roosevelt attended the 1962 grand opening of the first Temple of Understanding.   Read her eye-opening report here: <a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NewAge/Washington_Cult.htm" target="_blank">http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NewAge/Washington_Cult.htm</a></p>
<p>Green is the symbolic color of the temple complex.  Green is the color of the &#8220;new&#8221; occult pagan spirituality which describes itself in secular terms as the green-eco movement. Its worldwide utopian project is green spiritual communism.  It hails Lucifer as the first free-thinker and liberator of mankind.  Its&#8217; deity is Isis, the Goddess of a Thousand Names.  As Goddess Earth Mother, she is Gaia.  Accompanied by her feminized &#8220;gay&#8221; priest-shamans, she is Cybele, the androgynous male/female with both beard and breasts.   As the Egyptian goddess of witchcraft and magic, Isis  has many &#8220;feminist&#8221; lesbian-witches in her contemporary retinue.</p>
<p>As the modern world increasingly succumbs to the seductive power of occult spirituality, a global totalitarian pagan state is arising.  As it is the ultimate counter-tradition, it will demand nothing less than the counter-conversion of every soul, thereby claiming total possession of and jurisdiction over every man&#8212;mind, body, and soul&#8212; in a state directed by demons, or Transcended Masters as powerful New Age insiders describe them.</p>
<p>Researchers say that somewhere between 100,000,000-200,000,000 men, women, and children were murdered by Communists and Fascists during the 20th century. The Goddess Earth Mother will demand human sacrifice as well.</p>
<p><strong>Fast-Forward to the Past</strong></p>
<p>Long ago, Paul observed that there are only two sources for all religions.  He said either man will worship and serve the transcendent, living, all-knowing Creator of creation or he will worship and serve nonliving, irrational creation and its forces.</p>
<p>Demonstrating that there is &#8220;nothing new under the sun, what once was will be again,&#8221; the &#8220;death of God&#8221; movement put moderns on a fast-track to the past.  In the name of enlightenment, naturalism, free-thought, the &#8220;death of God,&#8221; progress, scientism, evolution, and autonomous reason, modern men have not moved forward to something new and better,  rather they  have regressed to revamped versions of the  nature-based religions of the pre-Christian past.   As a result, the situation of contemporary Christianity will increasingly resemble that of the early Christians of the first century.  In his novel, &#8220;The Final Conclave&#8221;  Malachi Martin captures a moment in the cruel history of the Roman persecution of Christians:</p>
<p>&#8220;Simon Peter at last sees it all as Jesus saw it all from the beginning.  Even then, Simon sees it from a topsy-turvy angle.  He and some two thousand other Christians have been tied to crosses stuck upside down on the grassy embankment around the Imperial Gardens on Vatican Hill.  They have been daubed with pitch.  Tonight they are to be living, screaming, dying torches.  Emperor Nero, his lovely concubine Poppaea, and their guests will have light to eat by and sights to joke about.  Each Christian will die in the classic sign of Satan&#8212;the upside-down cross.&#8221;  (cited in &#8220;Capturing the Pagan Mind, Peter Jones, p. ix)</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/pagans03.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/pagans02.jpg" alt="pagans" /></a>More than eighty years ago, America began moving away from its&#8217; founding Biblical-based worldview to what President Calvin Coolidge identified as &#8220;pagan materialism.&#8221;  Fearing for the future of our Constitutional Republic he said in a speech delivered on the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, July 5, 1926:</p>
<p>&#8220;Democracy is Christ&#8217;s government in church and state,&#8221; said Coolidge as he quoted John Wise (1710).  &#8220;Here was the doctrine of equality, popular sovereignty, and the substance of the theory of inalienable rights&#8230;.When we take all these circumstances into consideration, it is but natural that the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence should open with a reference to Nature&#8217;s God and should close&#8230;with an appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world and an assertion of a firm reliance on Divine Providence&#8230;In its main feature the Declaration of Independence is a great spiritual document.  Equality, liberty, popular sovereignty, the rights of man&#8212;these are not elements which we can see and touch.  They are ideals. They have their source and roots in the religious convictions.  They belong to the unseen world. &#8221;   (Backfired: A Nation Born for Religious Tolerance No Longer Tolerates Religion, William J. Federer, pp. 270-271)</p>
<p>The &#8220;pagan materialism&#8221; Coolidge warned against is evolutionary materialist scientism, also known as Secular Humanism.  Materialism is neither new nor scientific.   In the main, it is ancient Epicurean Atomism revamped and dressed up as modern science.   Materialism teaches that all that exists is merely material or energy which is impersonal, totally neutral to any moral system or any interest in man as man. In this view, there is no basis for law, and no basis for man as unique and important.</p>
<p>Materialism is of the world view of monism which teaches that all that exists is &#8220;one self-creating, self-sufficient substance&#8221; which may be divine spirit (pantheism) or spiritless substance (materialism).<br />
Monism is held in common by materialism, pantheism, and spiritualism and dates back to pagan antiquity and was or is taught by all non-biblical thought systems from Buddhism to Epicureanism, Gnosticism and today&#8217;s New Age Cosmic Humanism.</p>
<p>Monism teaches that all things, including mankind, are merely diverse parts of the one-substance.   God is acceptable to this monistic frame of mind only if He is not something outside of and superior to the one-substance but one with it.  In other words, God must be dispersed throughout the whole substance.</p>
<p>In his book, &#8220;Utopia: The Perennial Heresy,&#8221; Thomas Molnar explains that evolution, whether Darwinian or a spiritual conception such as Teilhard&#8217;s idea, serves as an imaginary mechanism of perfection for both man and the one-substance:</p>
<p>&#8220;Through evolution the world substance becomes progressively pure, homogenous and perfect until the terminal point is reached&#8230;&#8221;  (p.235)   At that point, there is either a perfected non-spiritual substance (materialism) or a perfectly spiritualized substance (pantheism).  For utopians this means a heaven on earth ruled by perfected god-men.</p>
<p>In that materialism excludes the transcendent Creator, angels, demons, heaven, and hell it must also explain away man&#8217;s God-given individual spiritual endowments &#8211;soul, mind, free will, and conscience&#8211; attributes defined by the Founders as self-evident truths, for it is self-evidently true that all men  think, choose, and feel guilt.    In short, in denying the existence of God the Father and man&#8217;s supernaturally endowed attributes,  materialist scientism abolishes our unalienable rights, thereby making worthless both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that Coolidge warned against pagan materialism:</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless the faith of the American in these religious (Biblical) convictions is to endure, the principles of our Declaration will perish. We cannot continue to enjoy the result if we neglect and abandon the cause.&#8221;  (ibid, p. 265; emphasis added)</p>
<p>Despite the valiant efforts of Pres. Coolidge and many other men of integrity to edify Americans, the consensus in contemporary America and the western world is no longer Biblical but pagan, that is, Cosmic Humanism (Eastern/Gnostic occult New Age) and Secular Humanism (materialist scientism).</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means that through the goetia (black magic) of  Darwinian transformism &#8220;we the people&#8221; have been speculatively reduced to aggregates of matter, subsumed into the &#8220;one substance&#8221; and now have solidarity (oneness) with apes, rocks, trees, fish, tumblebugs, pond scum, and dirt.   Individual salvation has become collective salvation, individual rights are now group rights,  male-female created distinctions have been melted down into androgyny, and monogamous marriage has become a sexual free-for-all.</p>
<p>Law, foreign affairs, taxation, politics, immigration, morality and all other important decisions are now decided by a small group of &#8220;elites,&#8221; many of whom are New Age spiritists led by spirit guides and Transcended Masters, and what they decide at any given moment is supposedly for the common good of society.  These all-powerful individuals are America&#8217;s Ruling Class, and in back of them, the U.N., NGOs,  and other powerful global organizations.</p>
<p><strong>The Return to Paganism</strong></p>
<p>C.S. Lewis  observed in The Abolition of Man (1947) that Cosmic and Secular Humanism  appeared in Western history in the heart of Christendom during the Renaissance.   The Renaissance reawakened a magic view of the world closely connected with  pagan Gnostic sectarianism, Eastern pantheism as well as alchemical-scientism.  Along with Eastern pantheism came spiritual evolution, reincarnation, karma and occultism, which means that evolutionary conceptions  existed long before Darwin.</p>
<p>Early on Lewis understood that Cosmic  and Secular Humanism  were merely two sides of the same revival of pagan monism. Thus he argued, Cosmic and Secular Humanism are not enemies in principle but rather cooperating philosophies united against the transcendent Creator, Christianity and Christian-based civilization.</p>
<p>Brooks Alexander also identifies both Cosmic and Secular Humanism as the two sides of pagan monism.   And because they are from the same root they tend to cross-pollinate and:</p>
<p>&#8220;mingle, producing a brood of offspring that exhibits the genetic heritage of its parents in a confused and confusing array.  Soon it becomes impossible to say whether a given movement, trend or school of thought is a secular impulse that has absorbed Eastern/occult values, or an Eastern/occult teaching that has dressed itself in secular language.&#8221;  (The Rise of Cosmic Humanism: What is Religion?&#8221; Brooks Alexander,  SCP Journal, 1981-82, p. 2)</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Ye Can Be As Gods&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The powerfully seductive Big Lie  underlies both Cosmic and Secular Humanism.   This thought is expressed openly in the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and  Dr. Beverly Galyean, leading exponent of occult New Age confluent education:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Buddhists and the Jains do not depend on God; but the whole force of their religion is directed to the great central truth in every religion: to evolve a God out of man.&#8221; (Inspired Talks, Ramakrishna Vivekananda Center, 1958, p. 218)</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we begin to see that we are all God, that we have the attributes of God, then, I think the whole purpose of human life is to reown the Godlikeness within us&#8230;So my whole view is very much based on that idea.&#8221;   (Galyean quoted by Francis Adeney, Educators Look East, Radix 12, No. 3, Nov-Dec. 1980, p. 21)</p>
<p>This same idea expressed in secular terms  such as self-realization and self-actualization (a term coined by Abraham Maslow) underlies many contemporary psychotherapies.</p>
<p>In carefully couched terms, the  &#8220;Humanist Manifesto&#8221; (1973) also declares autonomous man&#8217;s godhood:</p>
<p>&#8220;We affirm that moral values derive their source from human experience.  Ethics is autonomous and situational&#8230;life has meaning because we create and develop our futures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conclusion of both Cosmic and Secular Humanism is the same: human beings can be as God and invent their own &#8220;ten commandments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another key point at which Cosmic and Secular Humanism intersect  is evolution.    Secular Humanism adopted the Gnostic myth of biological (Darwinian) evolution as an explanation both for the origin and development of life as well as for the perfecting of the one substance and mankind.  Cosmic Humanism springboards off of Darwinism into imaginary spiritual conceptions such as  Teilhard de Chardins&#8217;  idea.   The apostate French Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) taught that God emerges from matter.  According to him, this evolution of God from the world results in evolution becoming &#8220;conscious of itself&#8221; and  ultimately, in the transformation  of all matter into &#8220;Christ consciousness&#8221; or &#8220;pure spirit.&#8221; He called this final stage the &#8220;Omega Point&#8221; or &#8220;the cosmic Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>New Age  techniques to get in touch with the &#8220;Christ consciousness&#8221; include physical exercises, special diets (especially vegetarianism),  biofeedback, chanting, psychodrama, consciousness-raising strategies, hypnosis and self-hypnosis, centering, body disciplines and therapies such as hatha yoga and aikido as well as sensitivity groups and encounter groups, Zen, Tibetan Buddhism and transcendental meditation and yoga.    Former guru Rabindranath R. Maharaj, now a committed follower of Jesus Christ, describes his former transcendental meditation ritual and its&#8217; terrifying consequences:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing was more important than our daily transcendental meditation, the heart of Yoga, which Krishna advocated as the surest way to eternal Bliss.  But it could also be dangerous.  Frightening psychic experiences awaited the&#8230;meditator, similar to a bad trip on drugs.  Demons described in the Vedas had been known to take possession of some Yogis.  Kundalini power, said to be coiled like a serpent at the base of the spine, could produce ecstatic experiences when released in deep meditation&#8211;or&#8230;it could do great mental and bodily harm.  The line between ecstasy and horror was very fine&#8230;During daily meditation I began to have visions of psychedelic colors, to hear  unearthly music, and to visit exotic planets where the gods conversed with me, encouraging me to attain even higher states of consciousness.   Sometimes in my trance I encountered the same horrible demonic creatures&#8230;depicted by the images in Hindu, Buddhist, Shinto, and other religious temples.  It was a frightful experience, but the Brahmacharya explained that it was normal and urged me to pursue the quest for Self Realization.   At times I experienced a sense of mystical unity with the universe.  I was the universe, Lord of all, omnipotent, omnipresent.  My instructors were excited at this.  I was obviously a chosen vessel, destined for early success in the search for union with Brahman.  The Forces that had guided my father were now guiding me.&#8221;  (Death of a Guru, Rabindranath R. Maharaj, pp. 56-57)</p>
<p><strong>Dying Materialism Opens Door To Occult Forces</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Unless we are mistaken&#8230;the twentieth century&#8230;is to witness a gigantic conflict of spirits&#8230;More serious and fiercer than ever before, the conflict is between the old and the new worldview.&#8221;   Herman Bavinck, Christian theologian, 1901</p>
<p>Materialist scientism has always been utterly repugnant to more spiritually sensitive people.  With its&#8217; nihilism, mindless mechanistic universe, reductionism, moral anarchy and irrationalism, it has generated its own crisis of credibility. However,  as a universal alchemical-solvent that has broken down the West&#8217;s Biblical-based worldview, it has served to throw wide the door to equally irrational but far more dangerous occult New Age Cosmic Humanism, which as a spiritual force began to emerge in the United States around 1965.</p>
<p>By the mid-1980s,  a bright &#8220;new&#8221; spirituality began to seductively beckon demoralized, restless, narcissistic, consumerist Westerners.  Promising personal &#8220;spiritual&#8221; power, peace, unending pleasure, and oneness with the Divine, it enticingly whispers, &#8220;you can become god.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Marilyn Ferguson&#8217;s book, &#8220;The Aquarian Conspiracy,&#8221; she identifies the &#8220;new&#8221; spirituality as New Age and says that this movement of spirit is poised to radically transform our culture.  Western society is at a pivotal point, said Ferguson in reference to what she called the &#8220;Emergent Culture&#8221; of New Age.</p>
<p>Ferguson called it the Aquarian Conspiracy for two reasons.  First, astrology foretells the end of the Age of Pisces (the fish).  Astrologically the fish symbolizes the Christian Age, which is finally giving way to the New Age of Aquarius.  Second, she calls it a conspiracy in recognition of a spiritually-cohesive, vast interlocking-network of individuals, grassroots initiatives, and thousands upon thousands of formal New Age organizations at every level of society, from the lowest level to the highest global corridors of political, spiritual, and economic power that link this movement both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>As occult spirituality moved with great speed and force over and across post-Christian America, mainstream media took note and reported:</p>
<p>&#8220;Neopaganism Growing Quickly: Numbers Roughly Double Every 18 Months in United States, Canada, and Europe.&#8221;   Denver Post, June 26, 2008 (How Evil Works: Understanding and Overcoming the Destructive Forces that are Transforming America, David Kupelian, p. 115)</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorcery Sells, and the Young are Buying&#8221;   Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 10, 2007 (ibid)</p>
<p>&#8220;Wicca is Believed to be One of the Fastest-Growing Religions Among High School and College Students&#8221;    National Public Radio, May 13, 2004  (ibid)</p>
<p>In his book, &#8220;America&#8217;s Schools: The Battleground for Freedom,&#8221; Allen Quist warns:</p>
<p>&#8220;New Age religion is now aggressively being taught in our nation&#8217;s public schools.&#8221;  A model curriculum has been developed that &#8220;is clearly centered on pantheism.&#8221;  &#8220;Much of what passes for environmental education and multiculturalism is really indoctrination in pantheistic/New Age theology.  The ACLU and other similar organizations have no objections to (pantheistic indoctrination).  It is only Christianity that these organizations object to.&#8221;  (p. 51)</p>
<p>Tom DeWeese, President of the American Policy Center, has also been following the rise of occult pagan spirituality.  In a work entitled, &#8220;Teachers, Preachers and Greens: The Unholy Alliance to Transform America,&#8221;  DeWeese reveals the existence of a well-funded yet covert effort to paganize American society through an assault on schools and churches.  He reveals that the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City is the home of the enormously influential Gaia Institute as well as the  Temple of Understanding&#8212; a politically influential U.N. Non-Governmental Organization.   DeWeese describes a pagan &#8220;church service&#8221; at St. John the Divine:</p>
<p>&#8220;As the congregation sit in their church pews in the great Cathedral of St. John, the Divine in New York City, the priest stands at the alter, ready to receive a procession of animals for the annual Feast of Saint Francis blessing. Down the aisle comes a procession of elephants, camels, donkeys, monkeys and birds. These are followed by members of the congregation carrying bowls of compost and worms. Next, to the sounds of music, come acrobats and jugglers. In the pulpit, former Vice President Al Gore delivers a sermon, saying, “God is not separate from the Earth.” (<a href="http://www.federalobserver.com/2010/11/14/teachers-preachers-and-greens-the-unholy-alliance-to-transform-america/" target="_blank">http://www.federalobserver.com/2010/11/14/teachers-preachers-and-greens-the-unholy-alliance-to-transform-america/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Men Have Souls &#8230;and Demons Exist</strong></p>
<p>Today anthropologists, scientific psychiatrists, and other professionals from the counseling and medical field take very seriously the fact that something frightening and unexplainable by Western science is going on here in America and throughout the West.  In their search for answers they are jettisoning as useless materialist explanations. A &#8220;new&#8221; consensus is emerging:  Men have souls and demons exist:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;we need to understand a number of different concepts in order to comprehend the worldwide phenomenon of possession and exorcism. On the psychological level, we have come to know the notion underlying all possession, namely, that the body is a shell, inhabited by a soul, and that this shell may on occasion be surrendered to an intrusive alien entity. &#8221; (How about Demons? Possession and Exorcism in the Modern World, Felicitas Goodman. IndianaUpress:1988)</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr Frank Lake in a talk on the demonic recalled the occasion when &#8216;Hans Rudi Weber was giving a talk on Christ&#8217;s Victory over the Demonic Powers to this large gathering of psychiatrists and theologians. It was quite amusing to see how uncomfortable the theologians were at this strange exhibition of what I think they regarded as Medievalism from a distinguished member of their own theological group. It was as if they were apologizing to the scientific psychiatrists present that a theologian had returned to the era of demons and evil possession. By contrast the psychiatrists were in fact leaning forward eagerly recognizing that the collective demonic is something with which they are continually dealing. As they said afterwards, &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t some theologian tell us about this before? We know what he&#8217;s talking about, we live with it.&#8217;&#8221; (But Deliver us From Evil: An Introduction to the Demonic Dimension in Pastoral Care, John Richards, London, Dartman, Longman and Todd,1974)</p>
<p>Possession takes two forms, communal and individual:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;&#8230;</strong>central possession is communal, strongly institutionalized, and ritualistically induced, but peripheral possession is more normally individual and spontaneous.&#8221; (Demonic Possession: A Medical, Historical, Anthropological, and Theological Symposium, John Warwick Montgomery (ed.), Bethany,1976)</p>
<p>“In later life,<strong> </strong>Jung admitted that he was open to the ideas that all these metapsychic phenomena could be explained better by the theory of spirits &#8230;.in the long run (he said) I have to admit that the spirit hypothesis yields better results in practice than any other.” (The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue, John P. Newport, Eerdmans,1998)</p>
<p>Dr. Carl Raschke also notes with alarm America&#8217;s downward spiral into the madness of occult spirituality.  He points out that the decadence, pornography, mass murders, criminality, the  &#8216;new religions,&#8217; and Satanism in American culture have certain social and spiritual ties that bind them together, revealing that they are part of a similar spiritual genus.   In &#8220;Satanism and the Devolution of the &#8216;New Religions,&#8217;&#8221; Raschke notes that Satanism is so widespread today that there are even U.S. military personnel who are members of secretive Satanist groups.</p>
<p>Raschke concludes that the &#8220;upsurge of Satanist practices&#8230;must be interpreted not as some kind of odd wrinkle&#8230;but as a culminating phase of the &#8220;New Age&#8221; movement&#8230;The Satanist mindset is not &#8220;religion&#8221; in the regular sense of the word, but a mystification of the most corrupt secular passions and values&#8230;Satanism is but the spiritual Frankenstein created by a social order that has attempted to sustain itself without God.&#8221;  (Satanism and Witchcraft: The Occult and the West&#8211;Part 6, Dr. John Ankerberg and Dr. John Weldon)</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;All the gods of the pagans are demons&#8221; Psalm 96:5</strong></p>
<p>New Age Cosmic Humanism has infused and spiritualized secular materialism, transforming it into an agency for the transmission of ultimate values and revelations from the unseen realm&#8230;.from powers and principalities.   As a result, in the space of a few short decades, occult pagan spirituality has made profound inroads.  Its upsurge manifests itself in the form of everything from UFO channeling cults, ghost-hunting, necromancy, goddess worship, shamanism, light-bearers, spirit guides, transcendental meditation, labyrinth walking, yoga, Wicca, revitalized Norse paganism, the annual Burning Man Festival (now televised)  and the proliferation of  Satanic cults.</p>
<p>From England to Australia, from New Zealand to South America, Canada and the United States, occult New Age spirituality is quickly becoming the West&#8217;s dominant orthodoxy.</p>
<p><strong>The End of the West?</strong></p>
<p>Evolutionary conceptions, monism, empiricism, reductionism, determinism, positivism, materialism, pantheism, socialism, and the &#8216;new religions,&#8217; in the words of Calvin Coolidge, are not &#8220;elements which we can see and touch,&#8221; but religious convictions, aspirations, ideals, and ideas in the minds of men.  As the great apocalyptic prophet Fyodor Dostoevsky clearly understood, they are a madness-inducing &#8220;fire in the minds of men&#8221; that comes from the &#8220;unseen world.&#8221;</p>
<p>This being the case, political fixes and Republicans in control will not cure what ails America because  Americans by and large, are spiritually diseased.   This means that our primary battle is spiritual, for we are not &#8220;contending against flesh and blood, but against the (evil spirits)&#8230;.against spiritual wickedness in the high places.&#8221; (Eph. 6:12)</p>
<p>Occult spirituality always surfaces at the end of a civilization.  It heralded the end of Babylon, Rome and the Aztec civilization.  It came at the end of the medieval world and now it has come at the end of  the post-Christian West&#8230;&#8221; a social order that has attempted to sustain itself without God.&#8221;</p>
<p>During Rome&#8217;s darkest, most evil hours, early Christians&#8212;thousands of whom were cut in half, used as human torches, and crucified upside-down&#8212;nevertheless successfully forced occult forces underground, thus allowing for Christendom and later on America to arise.</p>
<p>America is the West&#8217;s last best hope.  But do contemporary Christians and like-minded Americans possess the undying faith, unfaltering courage, love of Truth, rock-solid conviction, perseverance and will to engage this spiritual war?</p>

			<p><em><strong>Lose Your Illusions No. 1</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/utah-arches-national-park3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/utah-arches-national-park2.jpg" alt="National Park" /></a>Today we think of government and corporations as big and impersonal. But then, and now, the people who run things are relatively small in number, a club. The Club follows its own rules, rules from a book nearly a century old, which mandate two standards of behavior, kindness, honesty and concern for Club members, real people, and an entirely different set of rules for ordinary Americans. Normally members of the Club do not discuss the difference in standards. But one member of their club did so, with stunning candor.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/bernprop.html" target="_blank">Edward L. Bernays</a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>said this about his use of propaganda, which he had deftly repackaged as public relations. “(The)<em>American business community was also very impressed with the propaganda effort. They had a problem at that time. The country was becoming formally more democratic. A lot more people were able to vote and that sort of thing. The country was becoming wealthier and more people could participate and a lot of new immigrants were coming in, and so on.</em></p>
<p><em><br />
S</em><em><strong>o what do you do? It&#8217;s going to be harder to run things as a private club. Therefore, obviously, you have to control what people think.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Bernays clients were, for the most part, the large industrialists who wanted to sell product which Americans were resistant to buying. Using this simple plan of execution Bernays changed our diet, introducing a hearty breakfast with bacon as a nutritional improvement, persuaded women to smoke, and accustomed us to accepting his carefully selected &#8216;experts&#8217; instead of thinking for ourselves. He viewed manipulation of opinion as both the road to riches and a fascinating intellectual challenge.</p>
<p>Edward Bernays, the brother-in-law of Sigmund Freud, viewed ordinary Americans as &#8216;a herd,&#8217; needing guidance from an enlightened elite. Such guidance was provided by appealing to what he identified as &#8216;need for security,&#8217; &#8216;self-preservation&#8217;, &#8216;aggression,&#8217; or &#8216; sex.&#8217;</p>
<p>Bernays can be viewed as an early <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/15935/" target="_blank">Leo Strauss</a></span>, who instead of creating a &#8216;philosophy,&#8217; cherry picked &#8216;expert&#8217; opinions without associating himself with any specific institution. The outcome is the same, in either case.</p>
<p>Mark Crispin Miller, a respected writer, sent out <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://markcrispinmiller.com/2011/01/glenn-beck-plugs-mcms-work/" target="_blank">this video</a></span> by Glenn Beck on Bernays recently. Ordinarily, this is not a film this writer would have encountered.</p>
<p>Edward Benarys and Robert Sterling Yard operated using the same standards. Robert Sterling Yard designed the PR campaign which sold Americans on National Parks as resorts.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1915, the campaign persuaded Americans lands held in perpetuity for them should be used to build high end hotels, following the elite model of Europe. A practiced public relations expert, Yard, paid partially by government and partially by the new Park Director, Stephen T. Mather, produced a book, also issued as a series of small booklets, on the National Parks. Other members of the Club, for instance the head of the National Geographic, also assisted.</p>
<p>As you leaf through the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/parkportnational00unitrich#page/31/mode/2up" target="_blank">The National Parks Portfolio</a></span>, all six editions, photographs of resort hotels resembling those found in Europe far outnumber photos of camp grounds. The building of roads and travel by automobile are strongly encouraged. Feeding the wildlife made the Parks seem like an outdoor zoo without bars.</p>
<p>The materials read like promotion for a time-share. They were aimed at ordinary Americans who knew little or nothing about the raging debate, only recently stilled by the death of John Muir in 1914, on conservation (orderly use of natural resources) and preservation (wilderness kept in its natural state).</p>
<p>The appointed head of Parks, Stephen Mather sold the plan using rhetoric glowing with superlatives, asserting the idea the public should view these wilderness areas as their personal &#8216;resorts,&#8217; where they could encounter the world of nature while expecting the comforts of home. It was Mather&#8217;s proven ability as an adman along with his wealth, which moved Franklin K. Lane to appoint him.</p>
<p>The original notion for National holdings of land was to reserve some limited land in perpetuity, as it was before Europeans arrived and such practices as hydrological mining and clear cutting of forests had remade the landscape of much of California, and North America. Not Conservation, but Preservation.</p>
<p>If the America had been a nation of people managing their own destiny and making their own decisions the issue would have been presented to the American people directly. Instead, Americans were presented with a public relations campaign, resulting in passage of the Organic Act in 1916, establishing a separate body to manage the Parks. Previously management was shared between three agencies.</p>
<p><strong>The Club</strong></p>
<p>The Club was not large, then or now. When you dig into the details, personal relationships pop up like mushrooms. It was a small, exclusive, club, very much as Bernays&#8217; quote indicates. The policy on Parks originated with Stephen Mather, who, with the help of his friends molded opinion and controlled what Americans believed.</p>
<p><strong>Who Was Stephen T. Mather?</strong></p>
<p>Stephen Tyng Mather was a descendant of Cotton Mather, the Puritan minister involved in the 1692 Salem Witchcraft Trials. The Mather family later relocated to Connecticut. Stephen&#8217;s father, Joseph W. Mather, suggested his son for a job with Pacific Coast Borax Company, for whom Joseph ran the New York office, in 1893. Stephen Mather had been working as a reporter for the New York Sun since soon after his graduation from UC Berkeley in 1887.</p>
<p>Robert Sterling Yard stood up as Best Man for Stephen T. Mather&#8217;s wedding on October 12, 1893. The two were friends of long standing.</p>
<p>Mather was hired as advertising manager for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Borax_Company" target="_blank">Pacific Coast Borax Company</a></span>, first in New York, and then at the main branch in Chicago. Mather, a talented writer and adept at enticing public interest by positioning products, proposedadoption of the theme, “20-Mule Team,” which dramatically increased company sales, and ran the ad campaign. In Chicago he met the man who would be his partner in Sterling Borax, Thomas Thorkildsen.</p>
<p>Thorkildsen, younger slightly than Mather, was a first generation American, the son of a Norwegian lumberjack from Wisconsin. Both Mather and Thorkildsen were skilled with sales. Thorkildsen reported to Mather as his superior. It was reported Thorkildsen suggested the two men share funds skimmed from their employer. These is no evidence Mather mentioned this proposal to Smith. Smith discovered Thorkildsen backdating orders in 1898 and fired him.</p>
<p>Mather and Thorkildsen then joined in a covert partnership. Mather continued working for Smith and so had access to his employer&#8217;s customer base while the two established a company, Thorkildsen-Mather Borax Company, of which Mather was president, in California. Mather, using his salary, provided funding, as Thorkildsen worked to establish Borax holdings in Ventura County, CA.</p>
<p>In 1902 Mather suffered an psychological break-down and was institutionalized for a period of time. Smith refused to continue his salary, of which, Mather complained. Soon Mather ended his employment and began publicly working with Thorkildsen in California, their company became profitable around 1905 and its name changed to Sterling Borax. In 1911 Sterling Borax was sold to Pacific Coast Borax for what today would be $500,000,000. Mather and Thorkildsen shared the profits and also received salaries from Smith for ten years.</p>
<p>No mention of the impact this scheme had on Smith&#8217;s company was found but Smith&#8217;s company was bankrupted soon afterward. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Marion_Smith" target="_blank">Francis Marion Smith</a></span> started again and recovered his wealth, spending much of it on charities.</p>
<p>Later, the Mather and Thorkildsen justify their behavior toward Smith for various reasons.</p>
<p>For the purpose of writing this article I contacted three long time, respected businessmen, their careers in stock brokering, sales, and mining, and outlined the actions of Mather and his partner without using their names. Each man condemned their actions as unethical and possibly legally actionable.</p>
<p>According to an article, &#8216;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/12/local/me-8164" target="_blank">Borax King&#8217; Cleaned Up, but Died Washed Up</a></span>,&#8221;  published in the Los Angeles Times, March 12, 2000, written by Cecilia Rasmussen, Thorkildsen used physical threats to discourage competition and engaged in outrageous personal behavior which scandalized Hollywood. The two men remained friends and Thorkildsen was introduced to Mather&#8217;s other friends and associates as he became involved in government.</p>
<p><strong>The Park Service Public Relations Campaign</strong></p>
<p>The National Park Campaign began in 1915 but the forces which determined its form were in motion much earlier. The appointment of Franklin K. Lane, as Secretary of the Interior, was a political pay-off by incoming President Woodrow Wilson, made to ensure Wilson&#8217;s election. The Hetch-Hetchy would become the water supply for San Francisco, spending its crystal waters to start the flow of profits from lands awaiting subdivision around the city, according to Gray Brechin in his book, “Imperial San Francisco,” page 110.</p>
<p>Mather was offered the position of Director for the National Parks by Lane in early 1914. Despite traditions to the contrary, Lane was not previously acquainted with Mather personally and no letter was written by Mather resulting in the appointment. The recommendation came through a mutual friend, Adolph Miller, formerly a professor at UC Berkeley who accepted an appointment suggested by Lane in the Wilson Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Horace Albright is admitted to the Club</strong></p>
<p>Horace Albright, then newly graduated from UC Berkeley, had been working for Miller at the time Miller accepted the position as Assistant Secretary of the Interior. Miller invited Albright to come with him to DC as his assistant. When Miller moved on to a position as Governor for the Federal Reserve System the next year Albright remained at the Department of the Interior. Lane suggested Albright to Mather as an able assistant, in his position as Director for the Parks.</p>
<p>Initially, Albright hesitated. He was engaged to be married to woman living in San Francisco and planned to return and start a law practice.. Mather&#8217;s proposal to him changed this. Albright reported in <em>“Creating the National Park System – The Missing Years</em>,” feeling elated at being part of the vision Mather enunciated while reluctant to delay his marriage. He agreed to stay on for a year, the term Mather set as his own time limit for the work.</p>
<p>Albright had been raised in Bishop, California and had hardly left there until beginning college at UC Berkeley in 1908. His parents were hard working and used every opportunity to enlarge the opportunities for education available to their children, but lacked the resources to support Horace in college. Albright worked to pay his living expenses and educational costs himself and luxuries were few. His relationship with Mather, who was always prepared to pay for incidental luxuries, enlarged his experience, showing him a very different world. Mather augmented Albright&#8217;s government pay, a practice legal until 1919.</p>
<p>Mather could be the soul of generosity, awakening in those who knew him strong feelings of obligation and loyalty. His expenditures included a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/historyculture/rangers-club.htm" target="_blank">club house</a></span> for the Park Rangers in Yosemite in 1924, which advanced his popularity enormously with a group not usually provided with such perks.</p>
<p>The first time Mather met Grace, Albright&#8217;s fiancee, she and Albright were his guests for dinner at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. Albright reported, <em>“In one hand he </em>(Mather)<em> had a corsage of roses and, in the other, a small box. He handed both to Grace and laughingly said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how Horace could ever have been lucky enough to get you. I wasn&#8217;t around at that time, but I wish you all the happiness in the world.&#8221; Inside the little velvet box was a small Tiffany brooch, silver with a diamond in the center.”</em></p>
<p>Mather said, when accepting the job, he wanted Albright as his assistant to, <em>“keep him out of jail.”</em> Mather, it turned out, was not entirely joking.</p>
<p>Mather brought the same values and ethics to government he had demonstrated in business. His style was autocratic and impulsive. He personally decided on a corporate monopoly to run each Park. This approach was adopted in opposition of advice from such men as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Harvey_Company" target="_blank">Fred Harvey</a></span> of Fred Harvey Company, whose experience with serving the public began in 1875 with service run in conjunction with railroads across America. Harvey advised against absolute monopolies.</p>
<p>Mather persisted, causing a series of disasters within the Parks, starting with Yosemite.</p>
<p>Mather ignored the causes of problems existing in the National Parks. Many of these were the result of government mis-management. For instance, in Yosemite Mather complained concessionaires, such as David Curry of Camp Curry, had inadequate septic systems. But concessionaires could not finance expensive capital improvements without an assurance their loans could be repaid and these had been withheld for decades. Those in charge, including Mather, ignored repeated requests for licenses to do business longer than one year, granted only at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Mather consistently abused the power entrusted to him, causing harm to people engaged in doing business within the Parks. He evidenced strong likes and dislikes, which appear to have driven his actions.</p>
<p>In 1915 Mather unilaterally gave the concession in Yosemite to J. Desmond, who started a corporation in which Mather and his friends covertly invested. Mather granted a twenty-year exclusive concession and also allowed the sale of liquor, forbidden to all other concessionaires, to ensure Desmond every possible avenue for success.</p>
<p>Desmond had no experience in running hotels or providing food services to the public. The corporation went bankrupt and Desmond departed to be replaced by A. B. C. Dahrmann, who as president of the next incarnation of the original Desmond interests, was quoted by the Stockton Record in 1924 as saying,<em> ”The California Sierra is one of greatest undeveloped resources in the golden state.”</em></p>
<p>At the beginning of 1917 complaints and problems were increasing. At the close of a conference in January Mather suffered an &#8216;emotional break-down&#8217; and was institutionalized for a year and a half in a posh facility, described by Albright, “It was a lovely large home, tucked into green lawns and lush forested land.” The next chapters describe Albright&#8217;s efforts to ensure Mather is not subject to any pressure or problems.</p>
<p>Mather was not fired. Instead, his assistant, Horace Albright and others covered for him. The breakdown and his financial involvement with Desmond was admitted in Albright&#8217;s book, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/albright2/" target="_blank">“Creating the National Park </a><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/albright2/" target="_blank">Service – The Missing Years,</a></em></span>” available for reading online. Albright knew what had happened and suppressed the facts. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/albright2/pdf/ch17.pdf" target="_blank">See Chapter 17</a></span>.</p>
<p>Mather suffered another break-down in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.acpillsburyfoundation.org/1922-corresp-yos.php" target="_blank">1922</a></span>, according to Park correspondence. Again, Albright and others cover for him.</p>
<p>Mather&#8217;s<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.acpillsburyfoundation.org/mather.php" target="_blank"> business background</a></span> and emotional instability should have raised questions on his suitability for any position within government. Mather was, however, a member of the Club, wealthy and connected. Therefore his interests and well being were a priority in the bifurcated system then being established.</p>
<p>While rhetoric was used routinely to deceive, as proven so thoroughly by Edward Bernays, examining the actions of individuals reliably reveals the truth.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Club view ordinary Americans?</strong></p>
<p>The Club operated on the view Americans, &#8216;the &#8216;herd,&#8217; were to be managed with lies. These events illustrate the world view, reflected in the propaganda used by Yard and later by Benarys, on behalf of both government and corporations, reinforcing the ugly truth of the quote from Bernays cited earlier, “S<em><strong>o what do you do? It&#8217;s going to be harder to run things as a private club. Therefore, obviously, you have to control what people think.”</strong></em></p>
<p>The subtext is this: The only people whose property and well being matter are members of the Club. Albright&#8217;s behavior illustrates the degree to which he had adopted Club attitudes and beliefs.</p>
<p>As these events unfolded Mather received enormous attention and concern as his emotional condition becomes impossible to ignore. This reflected in Albright&#8217;s book and in correspondence within the Park Service. At the same time, the well being of those viewed as “just ordinary Americans,” was ignored, as in the case of those concessionaires such as Curry who objected to the theft of their years of time invested, the train of arbitrary demands issued by Mather and disregard of the conditions created by government mis-management.</p>
<p>Albright&#8217;s comments, and lack thereof, at the time of David Curry&#8217;s untimely death in April of 1916 and further justifications of behavior by Mather, which Albright later realizes pointed to his emotional instability, further illustrate the point. See <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/albright2/pdf/ch8.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Creating the National Park System – The Missing Years,” Chapter 8</em></a></span>. and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/albright2/pdf/ch13.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Chapter 13</em></a></span><em>.</em></p>
<p>Horace M. Albright had been, not surprisingly, seduced by the privileges of power and was now a member of the Club.</p>
<p>In the interests of full disclosure, now nearly a century after these events took place, a full examination of the records is called for. While writing this article this writer attempted to access the Superintendent&#8217;s Reports for Yosemite from 1916 – 1926. The reports from 1906 – 1915 are clearly available and complete and in our files. Those from 1916 – 1926, covering the years when Mather and Albright&#8217;s management most demands examination, are fragmented. Parts of monthly reports appear to have been eliminated. This report, purported to cover years 1923 – 1925, inclusive, deviating in form from all other reports was requested.. Upon examining it this writer discovered a report spanning 1923 – 1925 which included less than 11 pages, all photographs, for three years of activity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.acpillsburyfoundation.org/1923---1925.php" target="_blank">SEE REPORT RECEIVED</a></span></p>
<p>A request for correction was made. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.acpillsburyfoundation.org/yos-archive.php" target="_blank">SEE REQUEST AND RESPONSE</a></span></p>
<p>The request was also sent to Ken Salazar, Secretary of the Department of the Interior. A Freedom of Information Act demand will now be filed.</p>
<p>According to George A. Gonzalez in his book, <em>“Corporate Power and the Environment,” published </em>Rowman and Littlefield, 2001, Albright received gifts from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., beginning in 1926. Gonzalez also reports Albright&#8217;s home in Washington D. C. was partially funded by a gift from David Rockefeller as Albright continued up the ladder of success after Albright left government service, moving on to work in the matrix connecting corporations and government, unfailingly courteous and kind to those who had assisted him.</p>
<p>According to the Albright&#8217;s daughter and co-author, Marian Albright Schenck, writing in the Introduction to the book, “<em>Creating the National Parks, The Missing Years</em>,” Albright reviewed every letter and document and considered destroying materials while in the process of its writing. In the end the story of years 1917 – 1919 is told in a form while the reader takes away the sense much remains unsaid. Albright&#8217;s acts in covering for Mather, during this period and later, bring illustrate how in a short period of time an individual can accept the idea a small elite can rightfully abuse power. His later history only raises the level of probability Albright&#8217;s concerns were also for his own position as an attorney in the employ of government engaged in a cover-up.</p>
<p>Co-author Marian Albright Schenck wrote,<em>&#8220;My father worshiped Mather and wanted to do nothing to damage his name.&#8221; </em>While her sentiments are understandable, she after all, grew up as a member of the Club through her father, evasion of the facts is not acceptable. Americans have a right to know.</p>
<p>A baronial system displaced a representative Republic, beginning in the first decade of the Twentieth Century. Inherently hierarchical, it was comprised of corporate interests and the more elevated levels of government. Those involved believed they were justified in deceiving the American people, acting out the openly enunciated beliefs expressed by Benarys, and slightly earlier, by Robert Sterling Yard. These self-identified interests in government and corporate America began to install gatekeepers, and routinely limit what Americans could know. Spin and propaganda displaced open dialog and disclosure of facts as the standard.</p>
<p>The bifurcated system which confronts us today was being solidified in outline and attitudes in the first and second decades of the Twentieth Century, its pattern perpetuated by the very different treatment accorded &#8216;members of the Club&#8217; and &#8216;ordinary Americans.&#8217;</p>
<p>Today, Americans face proposals the Parks be sold to pay for the profligate behavior of those same Club members. As millions suffer foreclosure and Main Streets ask in vain for help, banks and other corporate interests, other Club members, receive the sympathy and open support of Congress. The term, &#8216;Barons of Industry,&#8217; is not a phrase, but a correct assessment of the system which was once America.</p>
<p>It started much earlier than you imagined and in the places you most trusted.</p>

				<p>June 1, 2010 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=7033#comments" title="Comment on An Ill First Wind Hits the Public in the Pocketbook"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="7033 http://novakeo.com/?p=7033">1 Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
			</div>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/pick2.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/pick2.jpg" alt="Pocketbook" /></a>The promises  of alternative energy generated from industrial   wind turbines are suspect when examined on the facts. The basis for   justification for the entire industry is that electricity generated  from   uneconomical technology is environmentally friendly. The public is  supposed   to accept higher costs from inefficient and unreliable generation just  because it is &#8220;green&#8221;. Touting wind as a free source of energy is   dishonest. This old technology from skyscraper size industrial  machines is   anything but free. The media seldom reports that industrial wind does  not   produce cost effective reliable electricity. Cowardly politicians who  dare   not oppose the industry ignore indisputable and inescapable facts  about wind.</p>
<p>Rational  reasons against spending public expenditures for   subsidizing a technology that has never yet replaced a fossil fuel  power   plant is overwhelming. If industrial wind factories were a real  solution, why   will not entrepreneurs develop their projects the old fashion way,  with their   own money?</p>
<p>Government  policy that favors and protects the economic failure   of wind projects is essential for the deception to continue. Even  proponents   of the most radical global warming myths are taxpayers and consume   electricity. Where is their outrage when costs increase at exponential  rates,   from ill-conceived wind projects, with no ceiling in sight? For  answers, an   examination of the First Wind Company provides a window on a culture  of   corruption that is indefensible.</p>
<p>First Wind  has an application pending before the SEC for an IPO.   A review of their <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1434804/000104746908008563/a2186834zs-1.htm" target="_blank">S1</a>, <a href="http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/091222/First-Wind-Holdings-Inc_S-1.A/" target="_blank">S1A</a> and  additional supplement <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1434804/000104746910005272/a2195887zs-1a.htm" target="_blank">filing</a>s paints a  very dire picture. Prospectus   disclosures, must describe risky conditions for a security offered to   participants and buyers. The <a href="http://boston.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2010/05/10/daily47.html" target="_blank">Boston Business Journal</a> report, &#8220;In its   latest Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Boston-based  company   reiterated it could default on an $80 million loan due next month.  First Wind   currently is negotiating with a consortium of banks to receive $240  million   in financing that would pay off a turbine loan that matures June 30.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of  First Wind’s financial woes is the failed   Cohocton, NY project. Original admission that the 50-turbine  development cost   of $265,000,000 have escalated by tens of millions after three seasons  of   refitting, repairs and substitutions. Clipper Windpower Liberty 2.5 MG   turbine is a total bust as a viable generating unit. Clipper stock  (CWP.L)   traded on the London exchange; hit a new low this week. The <a href="http://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/services/planning/planning_data_reference_documents/2009_NYCA_Generators_Final-4-3-2009.xls" target="_blank">NYISO</a> lists the  Canandaigua Power Partners, LLC   (entity of ownership for the Cohocton First Wind project) as having a  2008   net energy production of 10,155 MWh and zero kilowatt capacity for  2009. When   pushed the NYISO admits that the project is &#8220;In Service&#8221;, which   really means it is in the testing stage. No verified proof is  available that   any electricity generated by this project is going into the grid for  sale to   consumers.</p>
<p>Leaseholder’s  agreements have a minimum payment amount   with an extra small percentage for production. If First Wind were  really   selling electric into the grid, leaseholders are owed money on that   production. The fact that Cohocton leaseholders have not received any  funds   on generated electricity is proof that the project is a failure.</p>
<p>Actually,  the project consumes significant energy when not   producing usable electricity. <a href="http://www.aweo.org/windconsumption.html" target="_blank">Energy   consumption in wind facilities</a> lays out the different  requirements   of a wind turbine that eats up significant portions of electricity  generated.   When the wind is not blowing or a project is not set up for the grid  to   accept energy, the facility is a net user of electricity.</p>
<p>In June  2008, First Wind filed a complaint against the NYISO   with <a href="http://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/common/opennat.asp?fileID=11717915" target="_blank">FERC</a> (Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission) to   exempt CPP from the Open Access Transmission Tariff that had been  previously   agreed upon. The point is that First Wind seeks to transfer normal   development costs onto the backs of the ratepayer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/United+States+:+Southern+Tier+wind+farm+gets+$74.6+million+in+federal+...-a0207205415" target="_blank">First Wind</a> received in the fall of 2009, $74.6   million in federal stimulus grants through the Department of Energy.  These   funds had no restriction for use and no accounting disclosure  followed.   Democratic and Chronicle reporter <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/democratandchronicle/access/1852463191.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+2%2C+2009&amp;author=Steve+Orr&amp;pub=Rochester+Democrat+and+Chronicle&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=n%2Fa&amp;desc=Southern+Tier+wind+farm+gets+%2474.6+million+in+" target="_blank">Steve Orr</a> wrote  on September 2, 2009 about   First Wind’s compliance with the NYS AG ethic agreement. &#8220;First   Wind was one of at least two clean-energy firms that state Attorney  General Andrew   Cuomo investigated last year after complaints about collusion between   companies and improper dealings with local government officials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former U.S.  Rep. Eric J. Massa (D-N.Y.) wrote to President   Barack Obama, calling the grants &#8220;<a href="http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/3638058" target="_blank">very alarming</a>&#8221;  and saying the company   &#8220;abused the public trust&#8221; and had problems with U.S. tax dollars   going to what he called &#8220;shell companies&#8221; for First Wind. <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/59061" target="_blank">Massa</a> noted, &#8220;First Wind is under investigation by the New York Attorney   General’s office for alleged corruption. The actual appropriation is   going to Canandaigua Power Partners and Canandaigua Power Partners II,   subsidiaries of First Wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one  of the most volatile issues in Western New  York, and the award of $74.6 million dollars to corrupt companies that  have   changed names time and again, forming new LLCs and new Inc’s but   maintaining their business model of lie, cheat, and corrupt at the  expense of   taxpayers, has stirred great unrest in New York’s 29th Congressional   District,&#8221; Massa wrote to the president.</p>
<p>First Wind  CEO <a href="http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/3638058" target="_blank">Paul Gaynor</a>, a  former Enron executive,   responded in a letter to Obama, saying that First Wind&#8217;s New York wind  farms   have produced 133,370-megawatt hours of clean, renewable energy, but  never   provided any proof of his claim.</p>
<p>How does a  company like First Wind gain favorable benefits and   access to energy policy?</p>
<p>Reporter  Naomi Schalit of the Maine Center for Public Interest   provided some insights in the article, <a href="http://www.bangordailynews.com/detail/141729.html" target="_blank">Ex-PUC head enriched by utility company</a>.   &#8220;While he was Maine&#8217;s chief utilities regulator, Kurt Adams accepted  an   ownership interest in a leading wind energy company . . . A recent  First Wind   filing with the federal SEC for 2009 shows Adams’ $1.3 million   compensation included $315,000 in salary, $658,000 in stock awards,  $29,000   of &#8220;other&#8221; compensation and $315,000 in &#8220;nonequity   incentives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest  First Wind <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1434804/000104746910005272/a2195887zs-1a.htm" target="_blank">SEC filing</a> attempts to downplay the conflict of   interests and breach of ethical conduct of Mr. Adams. Their  explanation does   not pass the smell test. Such suspect business practices are standard   behavior for First Wind. It has a long history of using political  insiders to   gain special treatment.</p>
<p>Documented  in the Citizen Power Alliance essay, <a href="http://citizenpoweralliance.wordpress.com/industrial-wind-and-the-wall-street-cap-and-trade-fraud/" target="_blank">Industrial Wind and the Wall  Street Cap and Trade Fraud</a> is the dark origins of First Wind, previously called UPC. The <a href="http://bostonherald.com/business/general/view/20091115ex-partner_of_boston_wind_exec_charged_italians_nab_soccer_club_president_in_energy_fraud/srvc=home&amp;position=4" target="_blank">Boston Herald</a> asked Brian Caffyn, founder of UPC/First   Wind, about the arrest for fraud of his former Italian wind developer  partner   <a href="http://cfact.eu/2009/11/15/gone-with-the-wind-arrests-for-massive-fraud-in-italy/" target="_blank">Oreste Vigorito</a>.  &#8220;I read about it in the   papers, and I was very surprised,&#8221; Brian Caffyn said from Hong Kong   where he is in business with Chinese interests.</p>
<p>The  political cronyism between First Wind and the Obama   administration extends to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/us/politics/04emanuel.html" target="_blank">Rahm Emanuel</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123879462053487927.html" target="_blank">Larry Summers</a> and  their involvement with the   primary ownership interests of First Wind, hedge fund <a href="http://www.firstwind.com/aboutFirstWind/news.cfm?ID=dc5676cf-ade3-4eb8-a0ce-602720483c25&amp;test" target="_blank">DE Shaw</a> and  private equity firm <a href="http://www.futureofcapitalism.com/2010/03/another-117-million-for-first-wind" target="_blank">Madison Dearborn</a>.  Documented sources within the   CPA article substantiate the trail of money and influence that flows  from   this wind developer to the highest levels of government.</p>
<p><strong>New York  State a den of thieves</strong></p>
<p>NYS operates  as if it is a suburb of Chicago. IDA (industrial   development agencies) sell tax exemptions, state agencies ignore their  own   policy regulations to advance wind development, the attorney general  office   looks the other way when conflict of interest practices lead to  criminal   conduct and local public officials routinely take bribes for their  vote and   support of specific projects.</p>
<p>With each  complaint to the Public Service Commission, the PSC   bends over backward to have First Wind cover their paper trail  discrepancies   or modify their filings.</p>
<p>Governor  Paterson’s <a href="http://www.ny.gov/governor/press/press_02231001.html" target="_blank">State Energy Plan</a> calls for a &#8221; &#8217;45 by 15&#8242;   clean energy goal would reduce the amount of electricity used in 2015  by 15   percent below forecasted levels, while simultaneously meeting 30  percent of   the State&#8217;s remaining electricity needs through renewable resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>First Wind  is in business to claim their share of the booty. REC   credits (renewal energy certificates) are the new coin of the realm.  It makes   little difference if actual electricity is generated into the grid for  sale   to reap the financial rewards of this slight of hand deception.</p>
<p>Carved in  stone is a history of NYS favoring NYC over upstate.   The latest insult is the Power for Jobs hoax. The <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/2010/05/21/1057247/paterson-senate-agree-to-double.html" target="_blank">Buffalo News</a> describes this initiative,   &#8220;The agreement between Paterson and the Senate leaders would set aside   slightly less than a third of the electricity — at least 300 megawatts   of the 910 megawatts available through the expanded Power for Jobs  program   — for upstate businesses served by National Grid, New York State   Electric &amp; Gas Corp. and Rochester Gas &amp; Electric.&#8221; The   allocation difference goes to NYC. Assembly representative <a href="http://www.rbj.net/article.asp?aID=183932" target="_blank">Joseph   Morelle</a>, opposition states, &#8220;it takes low-cost hydropower   from Rochester and Upstate New York and ships it downstate . . . This   proposed shift would result in an increase of approximately $80 to  $125 per   year on the bill of the average RG&amp;E residential customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does  Western NY get out of this shady deal? You guessed it,   more industrial wind turbine disasters from developers like First Wind  so   they can erect their unsuccessful projects using out of state labor or  even   undocumented foreign workers.</p>
<p>The fallout  from the Cohocton Project is a horror story in its   own right. Real estate values plummet; sales of properties are  non-existent,   &#8220;<a href="http://www.kselected.com/?page_id=6560" target="_blank">Wind Syndrome</a>&#8221; health issues abound, an   OSHA investigation of a construction crane collapse and final  abandonment of   residences because of low frequency noise, shadow flicker and safety  risks   prevent continued use of one home.</p>
<p>The tragic  destruction of pastoral communities from insane   government policy would fill volumes of books. Most people will never  show   concern for rural areas or even the corrupt business practices of  crooked   wind developers. First Wind is just the best example of the unholy  alliance   and revolving door of crony capitalism that is driving up the costs of   electricity beneath the lies of &#8220;Greening America&#8221; and job   promotion. The public is asleep. Their righteous outrage is long  overdue. It   is time to clean up the system from the dishonesty of industrial wind   developers.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Although our name has   changed, our core values remain the same&#8221;</em> said Paul Gaynor,   President and CEO of First Wind.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/joycemeyer-03.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/joycemeyer-02.jpg" alt="Joyce Meyer" /></a>A Christian friend of mine  is reading one of Joyce Meyer’s books.   If you haven’t  heard of Meyer, she  is a popular health and wealth author/radio &amp; TV teacher/conference  speaker  who believes God is our sugar daddy.  The evangelist has been criticized   for her “conspicuously prosperous lifestyle.”  According to  my friend, Joyce’s books  are “uplifting.”  She didn’t like hearing that some of her favorite  author’s teaching is theological heresy.   To my friend’s way of thinking, if a book makes you feel good,  doctrine  isn’t all that important.</p>
<p>What galls me is  that Joyce  Meyer’s books are carried by “Christian” book sellers.  Worse,  her books have sold a gazillion  copies thanks largely to Christians.   Joyce Meyer is both wealthy and influential.  Albeit  not as influential and wealthy as  Oprah&#8211;but give her time.</p>
<p>One of Joyce  Meyer&#8217;s  unorthodox beliefs is that Jesus Christ <strong>atoned for our sins in hell</strong>.   The <a href="http://www.equip.org/articles/the-teachings-of-joyce-meyer/" target="_blank">Christian Research  Institute&#8217;s statement</a> on her  teaching says this:</p>
<p>The following  quote is from  her 1991 booklet, <em>The Most Important Decision You Will Ever Make</em>,  she  teaches a hallmark doctrine of Faith theology, namely, that Christ had  to suffer  in hell to atone for our sins and be born again:</p>
<p><em><br />
&#8220;During that  time He entered hell, where you and I  deserved to go (legally) because of our sin&#8230;He paid the price  there.…no plan  was too extreme&#8230;Jesus paid on the cross and in hell….God rose up from  His  throne and said to demon powers tormenting the sinless Son of God, “Let  Him go.”  Then the resurrection power of Almighty God went through hell and filled   Jesus&#8230;He was resurrected from the dead <strong>¾ the</strong> <strong>first  born-again man</strong>.&#8221; <a href="http://www.equip.org/articles/the-teachings-of-joyce-meyer/" target="_blank">http://www.equip.org/articles/the-teachings-of-joyce-meyer/</a> </em></p>
<p>Traditional  orthodox  Christianity does not teach that Christ’s work of redemption was  completed by  suffering in hell and being born again.   What it does teach is that Jesus atoned for our sins <strong>on the  cross</strong>.  According to John 19:30 “When Jesus  therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he  bowed his  head, and gave up the ghost.”</p>
<p>Orthodox  Christianity  teaches that Jesus’ shed blood was sufficient for the atonement of our  sins. The  moment Jesus uttered the words &#8220;It is finished&#8221; our sin debt was paid in   full.</p>
<p>What the Bible  says about  prosperity and success is far different from what Joyce Meyer teaches.   For example, Joshua 1:8 says, “This book of the law shall  not depart out  of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou  mayest  observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou  shalt make  thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.”</p>
<p>Does   this mean Christians will be influential and financially secure?  No.   According to my NIV commentary:  “Many people  think that prosperity and  success come from having power, influential personal contacts, and a  relentless  desire to get ahead.  But the strategy for gaining prosperity that God  taught Joshua goes against such criteria.  He said that to succeed  Joshua  must (1) be strong and courageous because the task ahead would not be  easy, (2)  obey God’s law, and (3) constantly read and study the Book of the Law –  God’s  Word.  To be successful, follow God’s words to Joshua.  You may not  succeed by the world’s standards, but you will be a success in God’s  eyes – and  his opinion lasts forever.”</p>
<p>To  “meditate therein day and night” does not mean  believers are to go into an altered state of consciousness to draw  closer to  God.  Christian meditation, as opposed to Eastern meditation, entails  reading Scripture and stopping to ponder the meaning of a passage.   God’s  people are not to adopt Medieval mysticism to “draw closer to God.” Far  from it.  We are told to stay away from paganism.  In Deut.  18:6-13 God says to the  Israelites, “When you enter the land  the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable  ways of  the nations there. Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son  or  daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets  omens,  engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist  or who  consults the dead.  Anyone who does  these things is detestable to the Lord…”</p>
<p>Despite God’s  command to  stay away from paganism a large number of believers have adopted pagan  worship  practices.  Their inspiration comes  from false teachers whose books are sold/promoted through so-called  Christian  publishers and book sellers. Quite frankly, a lot of books by so-called  Christian authors have no business being sold in a Christian market!   Don’t get me wrong.  I am not advocating book  burnings.  What I am advocating is the removal of  out-and-out heresy.  Proprietors who  have a mind to do this might want to start by removing the books/CDs of  the  “Prosperity Gospel” <a href="http://www.deceptioninthechurch.com/word-faith.html" target="_blank">Word-Faith</a> cult.    A cult? you say with steam coming out of your ears.  Allow  me to explain.  The Word-Faith movement is viewed as a  cult because it is a “false, unorthodox, extremist” sect of Christianity   (<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cult" target="_blank">dictionary.com</a>).  In other  words it is counterfeit Christianity.   Those who teach Word-Faith theology are wolves in sheep’s  clothing.  Jesus warned us about them: “Beware of  false prophets, which come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly they  are  ravening wolves” (Mat 7:15).</p>
<p>The book for the  serious  Christian to get into is the B.I.B.L.E. (Believers&#8217; Instructions Before  Leaving  Earth).  God has given us His  inspired, inerrant, and authoritative Word so that we will learn about  Him and  His ways.  In the beginning our Creator chose to reveal who He is, His  nature, His thoughts, His character and His secret plan of salvation in  the  Scriptures.  Knowing what  God says will help believers grow strong in His mighty power.</p>
