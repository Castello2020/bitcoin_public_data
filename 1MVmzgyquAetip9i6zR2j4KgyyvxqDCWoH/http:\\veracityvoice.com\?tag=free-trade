<p>For the last several years, the press on the disastrous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Union">North American Union</a> has been off front-page news. Nonetheless, the plans to remove barriers and open up borders keeps chucking along. Those who belief this course is desirable or those who conclude that it is unpreventable because the climate of globalization is overpowering, are subversive collaborators of the NWO or gutless wimps that deserve to be run over by the hordes of barbarians that flood our country.Jerome R. Corsi writes in the essay, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2014/01/kerry-signals-advance-of-north-american-union-plan/">Kerry signals advance of &#8216;North American Union&#8217; plan</a>, &#8220;with the expected ratification by Congress of the <a href="http://www.batr.org/corporatocracy/112013.html">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>, or TPP, the Obama administration already considers the U.S., Mexico and Canada as part of a &#8220;post-NAFTA&#8221; world.&#8221; What a horrendous admission to make. As stated in the article,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/17705-obama-presses-north-american-union-with-mexico-canada">Obama Presses &#8220;North American Union&#8221; With Mexico, Canada</a>, and this plan for hemispheric integration has a very long record of treason. Some background leading to the current crisis.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Following the establishment of NAFTA in 1994, under the Clinton administration, President George W. Bush attempted to deepen the U.S.-Canada-Mexico tri-national region with the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP), but public opposition spearheaded by this publication, The John Birch Society, WorldNetDaily, Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Forum, and other pro-independence, pro-Constitution groups, forced the Bush administration to shelve the plan — temporarily — and drop the tainted SPP moniker.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Bush administration was pushing the broadening agenda, under the banner of the Free Trade Area of the America’s (<a href="http://batr.org/gulag/073105.html">FTAA</a>), an endeavor launched during the Clinton administration to expand <a href="http://www.batr.org/corporatocracy/010814.html">NAFTA</a> to include all the nations of North and South America. As with the SPP, an awakened electorate put sufficient heat on the U.S. Congress to torpedo the FTAA. The subversive integration/merger plans that The New American had been exposing for years were confirmed in 2011 with the release by WikiLeaks of U.S. State Department cables showing that U.S. officials had been colluding with their Canadian and Mexican counterparts to undermine our constitutional government through various &#8220;integration&#8221; schemes. (See <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/north-america/item/10646-wikileaks-exposes-north-american-integration-plot">here</a> and <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/north-america/item/10653-wikileaks-confirms-north-american-integration-scheme">here</a>.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, it comes as no surprise when General Petraeus announces, &#8220;<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/north-america/item/18585-after-america-comes-north-america-gen-petraeus-boasts">After America Comes North America</a>.&#8221; He also boasted about how the three economies have been put &#8220;together&#8221; over the last 20 years as part of the &#8220;implementation&#8221; of the North American Free Trade Act. As The New American publication proves, resistance to a NAU is not only justified but also necessary if America is to survive as an independent nation.Back in 2006, Dr. Corsi refutes NeoCon proponent John Hawkins, who uses Saul D. Alinsky tactics, in Human Events account that <a href="http://humanevents.com/2006/07/21/north-american-union-is-no-conspiracy/">NORTH AMERICAN UNION IS NO CONSPIRACY</a>. The point is that the Obama administration is carrying forward the same strategy, ever protected by the lame stream media, to advance the disintegration of American sovereignty.</p>

<p>The video, <a href="http://youtu.be/CDIc_vTr22I">NORTH AMERICAN UNION FORMING NOW!! THIS IS THE END OF THE U.S.A</a>, provides a vivid analysis just what is at stake. In addition, one example of the methods used by Obama is reveled in the 2012 column, <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/new-obama-executive-order-pushes-us-closer-to-a-north-american-union-and-a-one-world-economic-system">New Obama Executive Order Pushes Us Closer To A North American Union And A One World Economic System</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most Americans have absolutely no idea how far plans to integrate the United States, Canada and Mexico have advanced.</p>
<p>Last year, Barack Obama signed an agreement to create a &#8220;North American security perimeter&#8221; and most Americans never even heard about it because the mainstream news networks almost entirely ignored it.</p>
<p>But this is exactly what the globalists want. They don’t want people to become alarmed by these moves toward North American integration. In fact, a document uncovered by <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/no-conspiracy-theory-wikileaks-cable-confirms-north-american-union-agenda.html">Wikileaks</a> shows that those involved in the effort to integrate North America believe that an &#8220;incremental&#8221; approach is best. Apparently they believe that small moves toward integration are less likely to alarm the general population.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, the pretence looks to be over. The fear of alarming American nationalists no longer exists. However, the Homeland Security policy to open the southern border is backfiring as seen in the article, <a href="http://theuniversalspectator.wordpress.com/2014/06/20/border-patrol-agents-quitting-as-obamas-mass-invasion-mess-at-the-border-permeates-the-rest-of-the-country/">Border Patrol Agents Quitting as Obama’s Mass Invasion Mess at The Border Permeates the Rest of the Country</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And now our <a href="http://www.infowars.com/border-agents-quitting-over-catch-and-release-of-known-gang-members/">Border Patrol agents are saying, screw it, and looking for new careers/jobs</a> as known Mexican gang members are enjoying the Obama/Holder ‘catch and release’ policy.More than one person is concluding the Obama administration is responsible and has <em><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/19/humphries-exclusive-inteview-arizona-sheriff-joe-a/">intentionally</a></em> set this massive border mess into motion with <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/20/boehner-rips-obama-on-texas-dream-deluge/">his policies on immigration</a>, hoping to force amnesty as his solution to the man-made disaster and humanitarian crisis (which is designed to <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yeA_kHHLow">never allow to go to waste</a></em>) of his making.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://batr.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/traininvaders.jpg" alt="traininvaders.jpg" /></p>
<p>Clearly the establishment’s efforts to create a fabricated immigration crisis in order to force a bogus &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; consolidation in this dreadful North American Union, is at the core of the mass migration. For the bleeding heart do-gooders, the death trains cry out for a more humane mode of transportation to import the Central America into the former Republic of the United States.</p>
<p>One such redemptive fix is to interject a dose of <a href="http://batr.org/twins/id13.html">altruism</a>. Replace the clingers on boxcars, reminiscent of Indian <em><a href="http://navsarjan.org/navsarjan/dalits/whoaredalits">Dalit</a></em> untouchables, with the sleek travel experience of the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541101/U-S-Mexico-connected-XX-billion-high-speed-train-FOUR-YEARS-taking-passengers-San-Antonio-Monterrey.html">U.S. and Mexico could be connected by multi-billion-dollar high speed train within FOUR YEARS</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A multi-billion-dollar high-speed train network linking America with Mexico moved a step closer as officials from both sides of the border thrashed out details.</p>
<p>The proposed 300 mile route would link San Antonio, Texas, to Monterrey, Mexico &#8211; slashing the current journey time from five hours by car to under two hours.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Just look at the advantages of streamlining a direct route from Mexico, that bypasses any border checkpoints and deposits these &#8220;PC&#8221; <em>undocumented immigrants</em> directly to resettlement facilities. The return trip south can be used to transport <a href="http://batr.org/view/062412.html">Fast and Furious</a> guns, useful in the drug trade, which is central to the economics of laundering monies in the North American Union hierarchy.A decade ago, the article, <a href="http://batr.org/wrack/010404.html">Do Foreigners Have a Right to Enter the United States?,</a> covered the efforts of Asa Hutchinson, the then Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Border and Transportation Security.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Starting this week foreign visitors will be digitally fingerprinted and photographed as part of a nationwide program to check their backgrounds and keep track of when they enter and leave the United States. On the surface this looks like a necessary and desirable procedure. This procedure is the first phase of the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s automated entry-exit system called the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology, or <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/us-visit-traveler-information">US-VISIT</a>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Guess that tracking system proved too much of a burden for the latest rush to process these &#8220;so called&#8221; undocumented migrants. Oh yes, let’s correct the terminology; this mass exodus wants to stay permanently in the only country that allows <a href="http://batr.org/twins/041506.html">open borders</a> for the premeditated and systemic destruction of their own nation.With the open admission that <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/immigration/item/18473-former-border-patrol-agents-illegal-immigration-crisis-contrived">Former Border Patrol Agents: Illegal Immigration Crisis &#8220;Contrived&#8221;</a>, does any federal officials listen, much less act to close the border? The National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers (NAFBPO) released a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;This is not a humanitarian crisis. It is a predictable, orchestrated and contrived assault on the compassionate side of Americans by her political leaders that knowingly puts minor Illegal Alien children at risk for purely political purposes. Certainly, we are not gullible enough to believe that thousands of unaccompanied minor Central American children came to America without the encouragement, aid and assistance of the United States Government. Anyone that has taken two six to seven year old children to an amusement park can only imagine the problems associated with bringing thousands of unaccompanied children that age up through Mexico and into the United States. I doubt even the Cartels would undertake that chore at any price. No, it has to be heartless corrupt politicians and their minions lusting for more money and power.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>There a few issues more absolute than the words of Ronald Reagan, &#8220;A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.&#8221; When Congressional <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/29/steve-king/steve-king-says-ronald-reagans-1986-amnesty-act-le/">Rep. Steve King</a> says that &#8220;Ronald Reagan’s signature on the 1986 amnesty act&#8221; gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012, he is prophesying even a worse future and inevitable prospects under a North American Union.</p>
<p>Reading a headline in the New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/us/politics/pentagon-plans-to-shrink-army-to-pre-world-war-ii-level.html?_r=0">Pentagon Plans to Shrink Army to Pre-World War II Level</a>, one needs to ponder what it would take for a defensive deployment on the southern border. If <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-General-Jaguar-Pershings-Revolution/dp/0803222246">General John &#8220;Black Jack&#8221; Pershing</a> was sent to track down Pancho Villa, what prevents permanent military patrols to simply guard the border? Obviously, there is not any junior grade <a href="http://sirlaugh.wordpress.com/2009/03/21/george-s-patton-vs-pancho-villa/">George S. Patton</a>’s in the army that would have the courage to buck the commander of treason. This border war is the true existential threat that Americans do not have the stomach to fight.Those who propagate a North American Union are globalists and hate everything that the authentic America stands for. Look in a mirror, that ugly face could be you, if you fall for the propaganda of the NAU.</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">US Secretary of State John Kerry, July 8, 2014:<br />
“In my travels as secretary of state, I have seen as never before the thirst for American leadership in the world.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">President Barack Obama, May 28, 2014:<br />
“Here’s my bottom line, America must always lead on the world stage. If we don’t, no one else will.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Nicholas Burns, former US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, May 8, 2014:<br />
“Where is American power and leadership when the world needs it most?”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Mitt Romney, Republican Party candidate for President, September 13, 2012:<br />
“The world needs American leadership. The Middle East needs American leadership and I intend to be a president that provides the leadership that America respects and keep us admired throughout the world.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Paul Ryan, Congressman, Republican Party candidate for Vice President, September 12, 2012:<br />
“We need to be reminded that the world needs American leadership.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">John McCain, Senator, September 9, 2012:<br />
“The situation in Syria and elsewhere ‘cries out for American leadership’.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Hillary Clinton, September 8, 2010:<br />
“Let me say it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century. Indeed, the complexities and connections of today’s world have yielded a new American Moment — a moment when our global leadership is essential, even if we must often lead in new ways.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Senator Barack Obama, April 23, 2007:<br />
“In the words of President Franklin Roosevelt, we lead the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good. I still believe that America is the last, best hope of Earth.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Gallup poll, 2013:</p>

</ul>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">The question is not what pacifism has achieved throughout history, but what has war achieved?</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Remark made to a pacifist: “If only everyone else would live in the way you recommend, I would gladly live that way as well – but not until everyone else does.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The Pacifist’s reply: “Why then, sir, you would be the last man on earth to do good. I would rather be one of the first.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, 1947, words long cherished by a large majority of the Japanese people:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">This statement is probably unique amongst the world’s constitutions.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But on July 1, 2014 the government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, without changing a word of Article 9, announced a “reinterpretation” of it to allow for military action in conjunction with allies. This decision can be seen as the culmination of a decades-long effort by the United States to wean Japan away from its post-WW2 pacifist constitution and foreign policy and set it back on the righteous path of being a military power once again, only this time acting in coordination with US foreign policy needs.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In the triumphalism of the end of the Second World War, the American occupation of Japan, in the person of General Douglas MacArthur, played a major role in the creation of this constitution. But after the communists came to power in China in 1949, the United States opted for a strong Japan safely ensconced in the anti-communist camp. For pacifism, it’s been downhill ever since … step by step … MacArthur himself ordered the creation of a “national police reserve”, which became the embryo of the future Japanese military … visiting Tokyo in 1956, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told Japanese officials: “In the past, Japan had demonstrated her superiority over the Russians and over China. It was time for Japan to think again of being and acting like a Great Power.”  … various US-Japanese security and defense cooperation treaties, which called on Japan to integrate its military technology with that of the US and NATO … the US supplying new sophisticated military aircraft and destroyers … all manner of Japanese logistical assistance to the US in Washington’s frequent military operations in Asia … repeated US pressure on Japan to increase its military budget and the size of its armed forces … more than a hundred US military bases in Japan, protected by the Japanese military … US-Japanese joint military exercises and joint research on a missile defense system … the US Ambassador to Japan, 2001: “I think the reality of circumstances in the world is going to suggest to the Japanese that they reinterpret or redefine Article 9.”  … Under pressure from Washington, Japan sent several naval vessels to the Indian Ocean to refuel US and British warships as part of the Afghanistan campaign in 2002, then sent non-combat forces to Iraq to assist the American war as well as to East Timor, another made-in-America war scenario … US Secretary of State Colin Powell, 2004: “If Japan is going to play a full role on the world stage and become a full active participating member of the Security Council, and have the kind of obligations that it would pick up as a member of the Security Council, Article Nine would have to be examined in that light.”  …</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In 2012 Japan was induced to take part in a military exercise with 21 other countries, converging on Hawaii for the largest-ever Rim of the Pacific naval exercises and war games, with a Japanese admiral serving as vice commander of the combined task force.  And so it went … until, finally, on July 1 of this year, the Abe administration announced their historic decision. Abe, it should be noted, is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, with which the CIA has had a long and intimate connection, even when party leaders were convicted World War 2 war criminals.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">If and when the American empire engages in combat with China or Russia, it appears that Washington will be able to count on their Japanese brothers-in-arms. In the meantime, the many US bases in Japan serve as part of the encirclement of China, and during the Vietnam War the United States used their Japanese bases as launching pads to bomb Vietnam.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The US policies and propaganda not only got rid of the annoying Article 9, but along the way it gave rise to a Japanese version of McCarthyism. A prime example of this is the case of Kimiko Nezu, a 54-year-old Japanese teacher, who was punished by being transferred from school to school, by suspensions, salary cuts, and threats of dismissal because of her refusal to stand during the playing of the national anthem, a World War II song chosen as the anthem in 1999. She opposed the song because it was the same one sung as the Imperial Army set forth from Japan calling for an “eternal reign” of the emperor. At graduation ceremonies in 2004, 198 teachers refused to stand for the song. After a series of fines and disciplinary actions, Nezu and nine other teachers were the only protesters the following year. Nezu was then allowed to teach only when another teacher was present.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">Yankee Blowback</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">The number of children attempting to cross the Mexican border into the United States has risen dramatically in the last five years: In fiscal year 2009 (October 1, 2009 &#8211; September 30, 2010) about 6,000 unaccompanied minors were detained near the border. The US Department of Homeland Security estimates for the fiscal year 2014 the detention of as many as 74,000 unaccompanied minors. Approximately 28% of the children detained this year are from Honduras, 24% from Guatemala, and 21% from El Salvador. The particularly severe increases in Honduran migration are a direct result of the June 28, 2009 military coup that overthrew the democratically-elected president, Manuel Zelaya, after he did things like raising the minimum wage, giving subsidies to small farmers, and instituting free education. The coup – like so many others in Latin America – was led by a graduate of Washington’s infamous School of the Americas.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">As per the standard Western Hemisphere script, the Honduran coup was followed by the abusive policies of the new regime, loyally supported by the United States. The State Department was virtually alone in the Western Hemisphere in not unequivocally condemning the Honduran coup. Indeed, the Obama administration has refused to call it a coup, which, under American law, would tie Washington’s hands as to the amount of support it could give the coup government. This denial of reality still persists even though a US embassy cable released by Wikileaks in 2010 declared: “There is no doubt that the military, Supreme Court and National Congress conspired on June 28 [2009] in what constituted an illegal and unconstitutional coup against the Executive Branch”. Washington’s support of the far-right Honduran government has been unwavering ever since.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The questions concerning immigration into the United States from south of the border go on year after year, with the same issues argued back and forth: What’s the best way to block the flow into the country? How shall we punish those caught here illegally? Should we separate families, which happens when parents are deported but their American-born children remain? Should the police and various other institutions have the right to ask for proof of legal residence from anyone they suspect of being here illegally? Should we punish employers who hire illegal immigrants? Should we grant amnesty to at least some of the immigrants already here for years? … on and on, round and round it goes, decade after decade. Those in the US generally opposed to immigration make it a point to declare that the United States does not have any moral obligation to take in these Latino immigrants.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">But the counter-argument to this last point is almost never mentioned: Yes, the United States does indeed have a moral obligation because so many of the immigrants are escaping a situation in their homeland made hopeless by American intervention and policy. In addition to Honduras, Washington overthrew progressive governments which were sincerely committed to fighting poverty in Guatemala and Nicaragua; while in El Salvador the US played a major role in suppressing a movement striving to install such a government. And in Mexico, though Washington has not intervened militarily since 1919, over the years the US has been providing training, arms, and surveillance technology to Mexico’s police and armed forces to better their ability to suppress their own people’s aspirations, as in Chiapas, and this has added to the influx of the oppressed to the United States, irony notwithstanding.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Moreover, Washington’s North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has brought a flood of cheap, subsidized US agricultural products into Mexico, ravaging campesino communities and driving many Mexican farmers off the land when they couldn’t compete with the giant from the north. The subsequent Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has brought the same joys to the people of that area.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">These “free trade” agreements – as they do all over the world – also result in government enterprises being privatized, the regulation of corporations being reduced, and cuts to the social budget. Add to this the displacement of communities by foreign mining projects and the drastic US-led militarization of the War on Drugs with accompanying violence and you have the perfect storm of suffering followed by the attempt to escape from suffering.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It’s not that all these people prefer to live in the United States. They’d much rather remain with their families and friends, be able to speak their native language at all times, and avoid the hardships imposed on them by American police and other right-wingers.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">M’lady Hillary</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Madame Clinton, in her new memoir, referring to her 2002 Senate vote supporting military action in Iraq, says: “I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn’t alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In a 2006 TV interview, Clinton said: “Obviously, if we knew then what we know now, there wouldn’t have been a vote. And I certainly wouldn’t have voted that way.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On October 16, 2002 the US Congress adopted a joint resolution titled “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq”. This was done in the face of numerous protests and other political events against an American invasion.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">On February 15, 2003, a month before the actual invasion, there was a coordinated protest around the world in which people in some 60 countries marched in a last desperate attempt to stop the war from happening. It has been described as “the largest protest event in human history.” Estimations of the total number of participants involved reach 30 million. The protest in Rome involved around three million people, and is listed in the 2004 Guinness Book of World Records as the largest anti-war rally in history. Madrid hosted the second largest rally with more than 1½ million protesters. About half a million marched in the United States. How many demonstrations in support of the war can be cited? It can be said that the day was one of humanity’s finest moments.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">So what did all these people know that Hillary Clinton didn’t know? What information did they have access to that she as a member of Congress did not have?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The answer to both questions is of course “Nothing”. She voted the way she did because she was, as she remains today, a wholly committed supporter of the Empire and its unending wars.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And what did the actual war teach her? Here she is in 2007, after four years of horrible death, destruction and torture:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">“The American military has done its job. Look what they accomplished. They got rid of Saddam Hussein. They gave the Iraqis a chance for free and fair elections. They gave the Iraqi government the chance to begin to demonstrate that it understood its responsibilities to make the hard political decisions necessary to give the people of Iraq a better future. So the American military has succeeded.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">And she spoke the above words at a conference of liberals, committed liberal Democrats and others further left. She didn’t have to cater to them with any flag-waving pro-war rhetoric; they wanted to hear anti-war rhetoric (and she of course gave them a tiny bit of that as well out of the other side of her mouth), so we can assume that this is how she really feels, if indeed the woman feels anything. The audience, it should be noted, booed her, for the second year in a row.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“We came, we saw, he died.” – Hillary Clinton as US Secretary of State, <em>giggling</em>, as she referred to the uncivilized and utterly depraved murder of Moammar Gaddafi in 2011.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Imagine Osama bin Laden or some other Islamic leader speaking of September 11, 2001: “We came, we saw, 3,000 died, ha-ha.”</p>

<p>The corporate media would have us believe that the nation is in the midst of an economic recovery.</p>
<p>In the shadow of the approaching mid-term elections, the president cites the number of jobs created and speaks optimistically about America’s economic future. The future is indeed bright, but only if you are among the wealthiest one percent of the population.</p>
<p>For instance, since the 2007 recession, the greatest crisis of capitalism in 75 years, corporate profits have risen, CEO salaries and bonuses are at record levels and the stock market is soaring. By contrast, workers’ wages have stagnated for more than four decades, benefits are either few or non-existent, and workers are encumbered with debt that forces them to perform multiple jobs— if they can find them—in order to survive.</p>
<p>Jobs that offer long-term security and a living wage are scarce even for those with university degrees. Adjusted for inflation, today’s workers are worse off than they were in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Whose economic recovery is this?</p>
<p>According to economic forecaster Gerald Celente, 90 percent of the jobs created in 2013 were part-time, most of them paying low wages and providing no benefits. Student loan debt exceeds $1.1 trillion, a number that surpasses the combined credit card liability of the nation.</p>
<p>These debts cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. The big banks and corporations that finance political campaigns have no such restrictions placed upon them.</p>
<p>Even the unemployment figures are deceiving. According to the latest government data, unemployment is at 6.7 percent. In reality, that number is probably closer to 17 or 18 percent, according to economist Richard Wolff.</p>
<p>The government does not count people whose unemployment benefits have expired or those who have given up looking for work. A cashier working 10 hours a week at Food Lion is counted as fully employed.</p>
<p>We have students, many of them burdened with immense debt, entering a job market that makes it difficult for them to earn a decent living. This is the economic minefield that workers across America must navigate. A little truth might help them find their way and comprehend why this is happening.</p>
<p>One of the many reasons we face such a bleak economic future is the implementation of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).</p>
<p>In 1992, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented between the governments of the United States, Canada and Mexico. NAFTA was fast-tracked through Congress by President H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Clinton. NAFTA was promoted in the commercial media as an engine for job creation in the United States, an assertion that is contradicted by the facts. According to Wolff, more than 700,000 jobs fled the country as the result of NAFTA, many of them providing middle class incomes and benefits.</p>
<p>Those jobs are never coming back. It is not just the number of jobs created that matter, it is the quality of those jobs that is a predictor of economic success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mass movement of U.S. corporations to Mexico wrecked the already struggling Mexican economy, particularly its sustainable, locally-based businesses. The situation initiated a mass migration of immigrant Mexican workers to the U.S. in search of better-paying jobs than were available to them in the homeland. Multinational corporations seeking a source of cheap labor and a climate of deregulation are the primary benefactors. The quantifiable effect that NAFTA has had on the U.S. workers is staggering job loss, reduced wages and increasing economic disparity.</p>
<p>Now, with the backing of corporate lobbyists, yet another FTA—the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)—is being fast-tracked through Congress. Both Democrats and Republicans are enthusiastically backing the legislation.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes the process: “The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a secretive, multi-national trade agreement that threatens to extend restrictive intellectual property (IP) laws across the globe and rewrite international rules on its enforcement.” TPP is currently being negotiated between nine to 12 nations.</p>
<p>If enacted, TPP will permit privately-owned corporations to have hegemony over the governments of sovereign nations. For instance, if the state of West Virginia were to ban the use of genetically modified soybeans, Monsanto Corporation could either overturn the decision or extort billions of dollars in remuneration from their projected loss of profits. FTAs belligerently put corporate profits before the legitimate needs of the people and the welfare of the biosphere.</p>
<p>The implications for students and working class people will be profoundly detrimental.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of jobs will flee the country, wages will fall yet again, autonomy will be lost, and the job market will resemble the wreckage of the Hesperus. FTAs are the means by which the power elite are turning the U.S. into a Third World economy. </p>

</div>
<p><strong>Urban War Zones are now a reality inside many American cities.</strong></p>
<p>It’s no longer necessary to go to Iraq, Afghanistan or Africa to enter a real war zone and have to fight for your life.</p>
<p>Thanks to massive CIA drug trafficking and American Free-trade Treaties like NAFTA, CAFTA, GATT &amp; WTO, many American inner cities have been transformed into actual war zones.</p>
<p><strong>These inner city war zones are infested with drug gangs that outnumber police and out gun them too.</strong></p>
<p>At present these gangs are typically competing and battling with each other for turf and making a living selling drugs and running prostitutes, some captive sex-slaves. At some point if the economy worsens and the SHTF, they could easily start looting and attacking anyone and everyone.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, in every major city in America at present, violent urban predators prey on the unarmed, old, weak, sick or disabled. And while out of control Police Swat Teams battle these predators and drug gangs, they often tyrannize the innocent which include women and young children, using excessive force all too often. There are numerous incidents of such teams murdering innocents after attacking the wrong home.</p></blockquote>
<p>The massive War on Drugs was designed as a dualistic program. One hand, the top secret part involves the USG bringing in massive amounts of illegal drugs to raise “off the books money” for covert ops. The other hand uses all serious gang crimes arising as a pretext to militarize the police as justify their deployment as Nazi Storm Troopers.</p>
<p>This second part of the War on Drugs is for public disclosure and consumption. In response to all this massive urban breakdown, the worsening economy and increasing government tyranny from the Department of Homeland Security, the TSA and out of control local police, Americans are arming at an astounding rate. Guns are literally flying off the shelves and ammo sales are at an all time high also.</p>
<p><strong>Americans now arming up in mass </strong>in order  to protect themselves from and this increasing USG Tyranny of the USG, DHS and their local militarized and Mind-kontrolled local police (1)  and from increasing and spreading urban crime which includes robberies, car-jackings, home burglaries and home invasions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also given as an important reason for arming up for the first time when asked, is a fear of possible impending economic collapse with an associated SHTF occurrence. Many express a salient and absolute need to be able to protect themselves and/or their family members from possible looters and armed home invaders which would likely accompany a SHTF urban breakdown situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>And who should be credited with creating such a foreboding urban environment? It is the Globalist Traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked the political process and Banking in America.</p>
<p><strong>These Globalist “enemies within”</strong> have rammed through economically disastrous Free-Trade Agreements and forced Diversity, Perversions and Political correctness accompanied by massive immigration, most illegal. All this has been designed to destroy the borders, language and culture of America, to neutralize its Constitution, Bill of Rights and Rule of Law while transforming America into a economically distressed Third World Nation.</p>
<p>These Globalist enemies within the Gates have been working very hard to transform America into a Democracy (Mob rule by the masses) from the Republic which was set up by our Founding Fathers.  Obviously any real enforcement of the US Constitution would assure that American would remain a republic the way it was set up.</p>
<p><strong>Since the imposition of so-called “Free Trade” policies upon the American Republic, urban decay and blight have become epidemic in major American cities.</strong> Many cities have turned into Urban Jungles, where only the strongest survive. In these Urban Jungles, violent gangs prevail and the weak are parasitized and consumed, afraid to go out of their homes, especially after dark.</p>
<p>Take Chicago, which has become a “kill or be kill” free fire Urban War Zone in some of its Urban areas. Chicago is the one of the most gun restricted areas ever, but the only ones that do not carry guns to defend themselves are law abiding citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Gang members have all the guns they want</strong>, supplied by drug gangs and the CIA and BATF.<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gang-wars-at-the-root-of-chicagos-high-murder-rate/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gang-wars-at-the-root-of-chicagos-high-murder-rate/</a></p>
<p>Some of these areas such as Washington DC have been rated as having a 300% chance of being mugged if out after dark in certain areas, which means you could likely be robbed three times in a single block if you have a victim profile (old, young, weak, disabled, female). The real unemployment rate is 37%, despite phony USG that it is 7% or less.(2)</p>
<p><strong>And now Detroit has been declared Bankrupt. </strong>It has been reported that retired police and City workers will now receive approximately 13% of their pensions due.</p>
<p>The Ruins of Detroit:</p>

<p>The ten Most Dangerous American Cities which are truly Urban Jungles at Night:</p>
<div>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aTES9UzRT-Q?feature=player_embedded" height="360" width="540" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>There are areas in Detroit, South Chicago and St. Louis that are so violent and infested with violent gangs that even the police refuse to enter unless ordered and then do so with major forces.</p>
<p>Until recently parts of Detroit was so violent that police and ambulances refused to provide service during the night hours and often found abandoned dead bodies (murder victims) days later. Detroit, known as “Iron City”, the jewel of America, used to be prosperous beyond measure based on the manufacture of the world’s finest cars.</p>
<p>Remember what a 1965 Olds Starfire coupe was like, or a mid 60′s Buick Wildcat or Pontiac Bonneville was like.  How about a mid 60′s Chevy with a HP409 engine or a Plymouth Belvedere with a 426 Hemi or 440 Wedge engine?</p>
<p><strong>That all changed in 1971 with the introduction of very extreme anti-pollution “clean air” laws</strong> which reduced automotive engine compression ratios from approximately 10.5 to 8.5, required the installation of retarded, goofy extremely inefficient camshafts.  The result was garbage engines that had little power, consumed huge increases in gasoline and a major shift in chassis quality to near complete crap. At that point American automotive quality was gone and is only starting to come back now forty years later.</p>
<p>This is but one symptom of the covert Globalist engineering of American Society on behalf of the City of London zionist Central Banksters.</p>
<blockquote><p>This of course created a great opportunity for the Japanese Auto manufacturers, secretly owned and controlled by the super-elite American Banking families. When W. Edwards Deming, an astute American engineer approached American Automotive Manufacturers in Detroit and proposed his plan to drastically reduce defects and lemons, he was rebuffed because it was felt his plan was too expensive and too slow.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Deming’s plan required 100% quality checks</strong> and verification of all parts from every supplier instead of the approximately 1% or less sampling. When Deming approached the Japanese, who had already shown a new coming expertise in motorcycles and quality circles in their electronics manufacturing, his program was accepted and implemented.</p>
<p>The rest is history, and after about 15 years, the American Automotive manufacturers have been playing a catch up game ever since for quality with the Japanese Auto manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>And now the Korean Automotive Manufacturers have hired retired Japanese automotive engineers as consultants</strong> and have adopted many of their same practices and principals to their automotive manufacturing.  The result?</p>
<p>Some Autos manufactured in South Korea have attained the same quality as the Japanese which are considered to currently be the highest quality in the world. As many automotive enthusiasts suggest, if you want the best performance buy German, if you want the highest quality buy Japanese.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a fair assumption that Globalism and the Free-Trade Agreements it produced, have resulted in the exportation of most American heavy industry, manufacturing and millions of good paying jobs. This alone has seriously harmed the American economy and set America on a path of destruction, starting first with its Urban Centers which have become urban wastelands and jungles, and now progressively spreading to middle class and upper middle class outlying suburbs.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Fair Trade with suitably adjusted reasonable Tariffs </strong>to protect American Jobs are necessary to America’s economic survival and prosperity. Free Trade is not Free at all and is an abomination to the American republic and its Sovereignty.</p>
<p>It is a tool of the Globalists to enhance the earnings of their international offshore Globalist corporations at the expense of the American worker.  It is nothing less than a secret war against America’s Sovereignty and the Republic itself.</p>
<p>The only other globalist tactic to destroy America that approaches its effectiveness are the policies of unrestricted illegal immigration, forced diversity, cultural programming that perversion is good, required perversion programming in the public schools that it is normal, and political correctness.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously these are all Globalist weapons of covert war waged against America</strong> to destroy its borders, language and culture and gut it economically.  These Globalist weapons have been deployed against Americans in order to transform America into a Third World “Democracy” instead of the Republic that it was set up to be by the Founding Fathers.</p>
<p><strong>These Traitors and Infil-Traitors in Congress and the Administration</strong> keep financing and running foreign wars for Israel in order to establish Democracy like they keep claiming we have in America. We have never had a democracy but they have been doing their best to kill the Republic on the behalf of their zionist owners and masters This is of course one of the biggest lies ever told.</p>
<blockquote><p>America has always been a Republic, a democracy is mob rule. Of course bringing in 30-60 million illegal immigrants and millions of legally sanctioned foreign workers has quickly undermined American culture and tradition and established a real base to elect politicians who appeal to the masses. The election of President Obama was the first of such travesties.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Up until recently when American aircraft manufacturers starting buying foreign parts, American aircraft were the best in the world</strong>, especially the military aircraft and fighter/interceptors. Now we have an F-22 with a contaminated O2 system from China that causes some pilots to start passing out and a Boeing Dreamliner with a faulty battery system that was imported.</p>
<p>For years St. Louis has been so poor that some of their police radio don’t work properly and their squad cars are in disrepair. In East Los Angeles, despite how tough and well armed the LA Police Department is, top police officials know that they are completely outgunned by Mexican drug gangs allowed to enter and do business inside America and also provided arms shipped by the CIA and the BATF.</p>
<p><strong>It’s not as if Americans weren’t duly warned</strong> what such Free-Trade Treaties would produce, because Presidential Candidate Ross Perot went public with what was coming.  He described the effects as a “giant sucking sound” for American jobs as they would leave America in droves.</p>
<div>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Rkgx1C_S6ls?feature=player_embedded" height="360" width="540" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><strong>But despite Perot’s grave warnings, President George HW Bush signed NAFTA</strong> on Dec. 17, 1992 with full Congressional support. The NAFTA Treaty was ratified after Bill Clinton became President. Soon after the sucking sound started, with shocking support the the US Department of State which provided massive grants to major corporations to move manufacturing to Mexico.  These grants continued at American taxpayer expense under the subsequent Trade Treaties that were subsequently signed and ratified such as CAFTA, GATT, and WTO.</p>
<blockquote><p>Unbeknownst to most Americans, President Obama is now deeply involved in secret negotiations to pass the Trans Pacific Partnership Treaty (TPP) which experts have described as “NAFTA on Steroids”. TPP is far more than just another Free Trade Treaty which continues to lower the value of American wages to the “rock bottom” levels in third world  countries. If signed and ratified by Congress, the TPP would be the complete end to any remaining American Sovereignty.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What established this frenzy for Free-Trade Agreements?</strong> It is now known that The last duly elected President of the United States of America was Ronald Reagan.  It is also known by seasoned intel officers that Ronald Reagan distrusted American Intel in general and especially his Vice President George HW Bush.</p>
<p>In fact it has now been discovered that President Reagan distrusted the CIA and American Intel so much, he set up his “Kitchen Cabinet” and brought in Lee Wanta as his Secret Agent under the Totten Doctrine (3).</p>
<p>George HW Bush was illegally elected later as President, since his father Prescott Bush had signed an Immunity Agreement that no future Bushes (Scherfs) would ever run for office after he was arrested for “aiding the enemy” and his Union Bank assets were seized by FDR during WW2.</p>
<p><strong>It is also known that George HW Bush ran his own private CIA inside the CIA</strong> which served the specific needs of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their franchisees, the American private Federal Reserve and major Wall Street Banksters.</p>
<p>Some former top American Intel believe that it was this private GHW Bush Intel organization that tried to assassinate President Reagan, by using their man, a secret service man who fired a high speed plastic disc from a compressed air powered disc-gun, the type displayed by William Colby in Congressional Hearings on the abuses of American Intel.</p>
<blockquote><p>PBS Judy Woodruff had reported this of seeing the SS man fire a gun from a second story window that night on PBS but the story was quickly squelched and she changed it after a very convincing “not to worry visit” from some very serious American Intel agents. President Reagan, despite a long slow disjointed route to the hospital, survived. This assassination attempt however signaled that the Treasonous Bush Cabal had attained a major power base inside the Military and Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sad thing is that all the political power and influence  necessary to accomplish this and to transform the American Congress into Traitors was due to the vast money provided to K Street Lobbyists and zionist espionage groups like AIPAC, ADL, B’nai B’brith, and the like by the Central Banksters and the various Judaic groups shaken down and manipulated by zionist for donations.</p>
<p>So the first beach-head of the Globalists (aka zionist City of London Central Banksters and the “Old Black Nobility” they represented) was established with a bought, owned and controlled US Congress.  Once GHW Bush was elected President, the circle of control was complete.</p>
<p><strong>One of George W. Bush’s major assignments was to take American further down the Globalist path by fighting more Mideast wars for Israel</strong>. Another was to destroy the Republic party by being the worst President ever and fully debasing the Republican, which he did. Now the Republican leaders in Congress are tricking the Republican Party into committing suicide by agreeing to back the Democratic legislation for making illegal immigrants legal and future citizens.</p>
<blockquote><p>So it is now obvious that the Republic Party is finished and Americans need to rise up and form a new Third Party. Otherwise you can be assured that just like in the last Presidential election, both candidates will be owned by the Bush Cabal.Unless the Bush Cabal has been fully exposed and displaced by then which is now  real possibility.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>It has been estimated that there are now approximately 30 million illegal immigrants inside America</strong>allowed in by a Globalist controlled USG who prevented border enforcement and liberal immigration laws which are not enforced. With the the passage of the currently proposed Democratic plan for legalizing illegal immigrants, this number could easily grow to 60 to 100 million.</p>
<blockquote><p>In most major American Cities, Police are not allowed to arrest suspected illegal immigrants for minor traffic violations or check their identification for legal status. Not so for those whose license plates are run and show up as actual American Citizens. And this is all due to orders coming down from a few top policy-Makers who operate at the nexus of the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).</p></blockquote>
<p>GHWB could now institute major efforts to undo all the excellent plans for the economic and industrial reconstruction of America that President Reagan had set in place and activated. As has been disclosed in a previous article (4), President Reagan had brought in Lee Wanta to serve as his Secret Agent because he didn’t trust the CIA which had been corrupted and hijacked by GHWB.</p>
<p><strong>It should now be exceedingly clear</strong> to those who are well informed about the degradation of the American economy and rule of law accompanied by increasing tyranny, deployment of DHS, TSA and the passage of all the unConstitutional draconian laws (like the so-called Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, and NDAA 2014).</p>
<p>All this is being engineered by foreign controlled Globalist traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked America and worked hard to export  heavy industry, manufacturing and jobs.</p>
<p>And that they are doing this to asset strip America, destroy it’s economy and the Republic itself in order to Balkanize America and prevent it from ever rising in economic strength again and operating as a Republic “of the people, by the people and for the people”.</p>
<p><strong>Their motives for all this?</strong>  To covertly re-fight the Revolutionary war that was lost and retake America on behalf of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their Kingpin overlords the Old Black Nobility (OBN).  These hidden masters of the world-wide occult network which runs the IZCS prefer to stay hidden in the background where they can pull all the strings of several top Policy-Makers in America with no personal risk to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>What can be done to turn this around? </strong>Obviously the first step is to get rid of all Free-Trade Agreements. In order to do this all the zionist espionage fronts inside America such as AIPAC, ADL, B’nai B’rith and the like must be fully exposed and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. In order to do this zionist Israeli-American dual citizens inside Congress and the USG and its Agencies must be exposed as traitors and agents of foreign espionage and routed out of power.</p>
<p>America has to stop fighting Israel’s illegal Mideast wars and withdraw all aid and support for Israel as long as it is a criminal, racist apartheid state persecuting and murdering Palestinians and stealing their land incrementally.</p>
<p>Lee Wanta, a great American Heroe that served as President Reagan’s Secret Agent under the Totten Doctrine and was instrumental in bringing down the evil Soviet Union</p>
<p><strong>We need to re-institute the Wanta Reconstructing America Plan</strong> based on the Maglev High Speed Rail System which has the necessary funding already available. (5)</p>
<p>And it is time to also re-establish the Want Economic Recovery Plan for America that was also set up under President Reagan, but later stopped cold by George HW Bush and his Cabal when they instituted a secret coup to take over the whole USG on behalf of the City of London zionist Central Banksters and their Wall Street and Federal Reserve Franchisees.(6)</p>
<p>In fact it is a reasonable assumption that the massive Free-Trade attack on America’s economy was largely a reaction by the Bush Cabal to these amazing economic reconstruction plans President Reagan had put in place through his Secret Agent Lee Wanta, who was the master strategist that took down the Soviet Union for President Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>Recent respected surveys show that a majority of American are disgusted with the current administration</strong> and rating of the lowest ever experienced in America in the last century. Congress is also rated at an all time low with only 9% approving of it. Many view the current President as an alien imposter with no traceable past.  Some alternative media writers have stated that he is a sheep-dipped CIA creation just like Bill Clinton. All this is a mute point.  Why?</p>
<blockquote><p>Because Ronald Reagan was the last duly elected President of the United States of America, the Republic, all presidents since have been fraudulently elected and owned by the Bush Cabal. And this Bush Cabal is the Action Agent of the City of London zionist Central Banksters and their International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS).</p></blockquote>
<p>The IZCS is centered in Israel where most intel is done by privatized Israeli corporations serving as American Defense and Intel contractors.  It is these private Israeli contactors who control all NSA raw intel and almost all American communications including internal White House phone calls and messaging, as well as all Pentagon and DOD communications.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously the Bush Cabal has been able to install its own Presidential puppets</strong> and run a lucrative illegal drug trafficking operations into America.  All done to destabilize and “dirty up” American Cities while absorbing a great deal of the Welfare dollars and capturing vast “off the books” funds for their own covert operations and bribery of Congress. It is a fair conclusion that the Bush Cabal has destroyed the American Rule of Law, debased any true enforcement of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights and has corrupted every institution and agency of the USG.</p>
<p><strong>However there is good news</strong>.  A growing force for good has emerged in the Alternative Media now transmitted everywhere instantly on demand by the worldwide Internet, the new Gutenberg Press and the NWO Globalist’s Achilles Heel. Yes, the Controlled Mass media (CMMM) has been a propaganda mouthpiece for the Bush Cabal and the IZCS, but is now losing its appeal and credibility. The CMMM keeps feeding lies and crap to the American public that are obviously false, like the Mideast American wars are wars to establish Democracy.  More and more Americans now realize this is complete BS, that we are there to fight Israel’s wars and defend British Oil interests.</p>
<blockquote><p>Compare the articles of Veterans Today and other respected truth media now which are being published and read by millions inside America and all over the world with the CMMM. You will see the gap between the alternative media truth and the CMMM lies is ever widening and we are starting to see Alternative Media’s popularity driving stories into the CMMM, even thought the CMMM usually attempts to neutralize their significance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many thousands of brave American Soldiers who were lied to and deceived into fighting these illegal, unConstitutional, unprovoked, undeclared wars for Israel and Big Oil, thinking that they were defending America and its freedom. Few greater lies and deceptions has ever been predicated on Americans than this complete lie.  Many thousands of Americans have been killed and horribly wounded and disabled in this war.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the American Military ever fully realizes that all these wars were phony and based on a lie and that Israel did the 9/11 attacks with the help of a cabal within the USAF and JCS, there will be hell to pay for all those perps involved. And now there is good reason to believe that day is coming in the not too distant future.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As most Americans are beginning to realize, America has been infil-Traited by Traitors and Infil-Traitors in the highest positions of the USG</strong>.  The major economic deterioration and loss of assets to the Wall Street Banksters and the private Federal reserve through financial Fraud have been staggering and Americans are catching on the the BLATANTLY OBVIOUS.</p>
<p><strong>When American society reaches a critical mass awakening</strong> to this obvious situation that Globalists have been doing everything they can to destroy America, there will be major Blow-back of astounding proportions. When 12% of Americans are awakened, a critical mass and major turning point will be reached and you will begin to see major social change like never conceived, and this will all be due to major Blow-back from awakening.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The elites hate to acknowledge it, but when large numbers of ordinary people are moved to action, it changes the narrow political world where the elites call the shots. Inside accounts reveal the extent to which Johnson and Nixon’s conduct of the Vietnam War was constrained by the huge anti-war movement. It was the civil rights movement, not compelling arguments, that convinced members of Congress to end legal racial discrimination. More recently, the townhall meetings, dominated by people opposed to health care reform, have been a serious roadblock for those pushing reform…. A big turnout … can make a real difference….When someone tells you to stop imagining that you are having an impact, ask them to please direct their energy into getting 10 friends to join you in doing what needs to be done. If it has no impact, you’ll have gone down trying. If it has an impact, nobody will tell you for many years. (7)</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This coming complete awakening will be due to information dispensed and diffused by the Alternative Media</strong> and the worldwide Internet as well as word of mouth. it is best viewed as a byproduct of a new and powerful emerging worldwide populism which has now reached the point it is unstoppable. One recent study has established 10% as a critical mass, turning point for Society.(8)</p>
<p>I believe we are already at 11% and when we reach 12%, the days of the Bush cabal will be dated. They know it too and are scared sh*tless. That is why they have been going for broke trying to ram the NWO down our throats and militarize local police and build up DHS to oppress and then mass murder us.</p>
<p><strong>It’s time to speak up to all your family, friends and associates</strong> that we need to abandon the Republican and Democratic political Parties.  Both parties are owned and controlled by the same Overlord, the IZCS who bought them and can blackmail them with NSA provided intel.</p>
<p>Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who is also a Vet and a Navy Seal/UDT man had it right in his book of the Replican and Democrat Political Gangs in America, DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans (9).</p>
<p>Gov. Ventura recommends Americans dump both political Parties which serve the same corrupt masters and start electing alternative candidates only who are not associated with either of the two parties.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It should now be exceedingly clear to those who are well informed about the degradation of the American economy and rule of law</strong> accompanied by increasing tyranny, deployment of DHS, TSA and the passage of all the unConstitutional draconian laws (like the so-called Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, and NDAA 2014), that all this is being engineered by foreign controlled Globalist traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked America and worked hard to export  heavy industry, manufacturing and jobs.</p>
<p>And that they are doing this to asset strip America, destroy it’s economy and the Republic itself in order to Balkanize America and prevent it from ever rising in economic strength again and operating as a Republic “of the people, by the people and for the people”.</p>
<p><strong>Their motives for all this?</strong>  To covertly re-fight the Revolutionary war that was lost and retake America on behalf of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their Kingpin overlords the Old Black Nobility (OBN).  These hidden masters of the world-wide occult network which runs the IZCS prefer to stay hidden in the background where they can pull all the strings of several top Policy-Makers in America with no personal risk to themselves.</p>

<p align="left">The economy has been debilitated by the offshoring of middle class jobs for the benefit of corporate profits and by the Federal Reserve’s policy of Quantitative Easing in order to support a few oversized banks that the government protects from market discipline. Not only does QE distort bond and stock markets, it threatens the value of the dollar and has resulted in manipulation of the gold price.</p>
<p align="left">See <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/01/17/hows-whys-gold-price-manipulation/" target="_blank">http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/01/17/hows-whys-gold-price-manipulation/</a></p>
<p>When US corporations send jobs offshore, the GDP, consumer income, tax base, and careers associated with the jobs go abroad with the jobs. Corporations gain the additional profits at large costs to the economy in terms of less employment, less economic growth, reduced state, local and federal tax revenues, wider deficits, and impairments of social services.</p>
<p>When policymakers permitted banks to become independent of market discipline, they made the banks an unresolved burden on the economy. Authorities have provided no honest report on the condition of the banks. It remains to be seen if the Federal Reserve can create enough money to monetize enough debt to rescue the banks without collapsing the US dollar. It would have been far cheaper to let the banks fail and be reorganized.</p>
<p>US policymakers and their echo chamber in the economics profession have let the country down badly. They claimed that there was a “New Economy” to take the place of the “old economy” jobs that were moved offshore. As I have pointed out for a decade, US jobs statistics show no sign of the promised “New Economy.”</p>
<p>The same policymakers and economists who told us that “markets are self-regulating” and that the financial sector could safely be deregulated also confused jobs offshoring with free trade. Hyped “studies” were put together designed to prove that jobs offshoring was good for the US economy. It is difficult to fathom how such destructive errors could consistently be made by policymakers and economists for more than a decade. Were these mistakes or cover for a narrow and selfish agenda?</p>
<p>In June, 2009 happy talk appeared about “the recovery,” now 4.5 years old. As John Williams (shadowstats.com) has made clear, “the recovery” is entirely the artifact of the understated measure of inflation used to deflate nominal GDP. By under-measuring inflation, the government can show low, but positive, rates of real GDP growth. No other indicator supports the claim of economic recovery.</p>
<p>John Williams writes that consumer inflation, if properly measured, is running around 9%, far above the 2% figure that is the Fed’s target and more in line with what consumers are actually experiencing. We have just had a 6.5% annual increase in the cost of a postage stamp.</p>
<p>The Fed’s target inflation rate is said to be low, but Simon Black points out that the result of a lifetime of 2% annual inflation is the loss of 75% of the purchasing power of the currency. He uses the cost of sending a postcard to illustrate the decline in the purchasing power of median household income today compared to 1951. That year it cost one cent to send a post card. As household income was $4,237, the household could send 423,700 postcards. Today the comparable income figure is $51,017. As it costs 34 cents to send one postcard, today’s household can only afford to send 150,050 postcards. Nominal income rose 12 times, and the cost of sending a postcard rose 34 times.</p>
<p>Just as the American people know that there is more inflation than is reported, they know that there is no recovery. The Gallup Poll reported this month that only 28% of Americans are satisfied with the economy. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166871/americans-satisfaction-economy-sours-2001.aspx?version=print" target="_blank">http://www.gallup.com/poll/166871/americans-satisfaction-economy-sours-2001.aspx?version=print</a></p>
<p>From hard experience, Americans have also caught on that “free trade agreements” are nothing but vehicles for moving their jobs abroad. The latest effort by the corporations to loot and defraud the public is known as the “Trans-Pacific Partnership.” “Fast-tracking” the bill allowed the corporations to write the bill in secret without congressional input. Some research shows that 90% of Americans will suffer income losses under TPP, while wealth becomes even more concentrated at the top.</p>
<p>TPP affects every aspect of our lives from what we eat to the Internet to the environment. According to Kevin Zeese in Alternet, “the leak of the [TPP] Intellectual Property Chapter revealed that it created a path to patent everything imaginable, including plants and animals, to turn everything into a commodity for profit.”</p>
<p>The secretly drafted TPP also creates authority for the executive branch to change existing US law to make the laws that were not passed in secret compatible with the secretly written trade bill. Buy American requirements and any attempt to curtail jobs offshoring would become illegal “restraints on trade.”</p>
<p>If the House and Senate are willing to turn over their legislative function to the executive branch, they might as well abolish themselves.</p>
<p>The financial media has been helping the Federal Reserve and the banks to cover up festering problems with rosy hype, but realization that there are serious unresolved problems might be spreading. Last week interest rates on 30-day T-bills turned negative. That means people were paying more for a bond than it would return at maturity. Dave Kranzler sees this as a sign of rising uncertainty about banks. Reminiscent of the Cyprus banks’ limits on withdrawals, last Friday (January 24) the BBC reported that the large UK bank HSBC is preventing customers from withdrawing cash from their accounts in excess of several thousand pounds.<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25861717" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25861717 </a></p>
<p>If and when uncertainty spreads to the dollar, the real crisis will arrive, likely followed by high inflation, exchange controls, pension confiscations, and resurrected illegality of owning gold and silver. Capitalist greed aided and abetted by economists and policymakers will have destroyed America.</p>

<p>The globalists put their plan into motion decades ago. The proper meaning of the headline is not that China is an economic miracle, but that the United States, systematically stripped of its industrial might, is destined to fall even further. The Chinese economy is a haven of direct transnational integration. The outsourcing of manufacturing from domestic capacity is not solely a response of cheaper economic cost of goods production. No, the underlying reason for the migration of product assemblage is to weaken an independent American economy.</p>
<p>The news of this long awaited milestone, primarily announced in the foreign press, almost has a ring of glee. The Guardian reports that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/10/china-surpasses-us-world-largest-trading-nation">China surpasses US as world&#8217;s largest trading nation</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;China’s annual trade in goods passed the $4tn (£2.4tn) mark for the first time last year according to official data, after exports from the world&#8217;s second largest economy rose 7.9% to $2.21tn and imports rose 7.3% to $1.95tn.</p>
<p>As a result total trade rose 7.6% over the year to $4.16tn. The US is yet to publish its 2013 trade figures, but with trade totaling $3.5tn in the first 11 months of the year, it is unlikely to beat China.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Further coverage presented in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10565166/China-overtakes-US-to-become-worlds-biggest-goods-trading-nation.html">Telegraph</a>, the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c2dbd70-79a6-11e3-b381-00144feabdc0.html">Financial Times</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25678415">BBC</a>, reflects I told you so attitude.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s always been a matter of time until China surpasses the US &#8230; and there are good reasons to believe that China is likely to retain this pole position for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trade figures look very healthy and the factors underpinning them are structurally sustainable. It is hard to see them being reversed significantly, at least in the short to medium term.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Contrast this viewpoint with the assessment out of <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/01/10/china-were-now-the-biggest-trading-nation-in-the-world/">Marketwatch</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;And let’s not forget: The economic data out of Chinese agencies has long been seen as a bit questionable. Even the country’s own statistics office has said it is trying to clean up the inaccuracies. As our own <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-exports-trade-surplus-miss-forecasts-2014-01-09-221034612">Michael Kitchen points out</a>, trade data has come under particular suspicion, as businesses disguise some money flows as trade to try to bypass controls.&#8221;Of course, the U.S. press continues to make excuses that conceal the betrayal of American trade policy goals and practices. These are the same business journalists that repeat the statistical figures coming out of recent administrations that need revisions, when caught in dramatic errors of omission or deception.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Proponents of a structured destruction of America’s economy, laud international trade, as long as it slanted to eliminate domestic survival and reduces our standard of living. This lunacy, stated in <a href="http://www.economywatch.com/international-trade/benefit.html">Benefits of International Trade</a>, does not square with the aftermath of a trade deficit that has become a permanent fixture.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some important benefits of International Trade</p>
<ul>
<li> Enhances the domestic competitiveness</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Takes advantage of international trade technology</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Increases sales and profits</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Extend sales potential of the existing products</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Maintain cost competitiveness in your domestic market</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Enhance potential for expansion of your business</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Gains a global market share</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Reduce dependence on existing markets</li>
<li> Stabilize seasonal market fluctuations</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Now examine the real significance of this &#8220;Free Trade&#8221; globalist plan for America.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. How can domestic competitiveness improve, when entire industries move offshore?</p>
<p>2. Where is the advantage in developing new technology domestically and transferring it to foreign plants, even if owned by &#8220;so called&#8221; U.S. national companies?</p>
<p>3. Increase sales and profits, booked by foreign subsidiaries, means that the capital is not repatriated back.</p>
<p>4. If products produced domestically, shipped, and sold to overseas markets, there would be a valid benefit. However, the direction is in reverse.</p>
<p>5. Maintaining cost competitiveness translates into closing domestic facilities.</p>
<p>6. Expansion of business means look overseas because domestic consumers have less money to spend.</p>
<p>7. Oh yes, the holy grail of market share, means last company standing, since domestic markets have reduced sales.</p>
<p>8. Yep, now that existing domestic markets are sinking, move your boat to a different ocean.</p>
<p>9. Seasonal fluctuations means that booms are past profit spikes, the new normal is a perpetual dip.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chinese perspective as reported in <a href="http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2014-01/04/content_17215275.htm">China Daily</a> from Wang Haifeng, a researcher with the Institute for International Economic Research at the National Development and Reform Commission, needs especial emphasis.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The size of the value of the trade in goods tells just one side of the story. The other side is that China&#8217;s export competitiveness, as well as the competitiveness of its trade structure, is far behind the US. The competitive advantage of US exports centers on its technology, quality and brands, with added-value being very significant. China&#8217;s export prices are much cheaper on average and a large part of its exports are from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers),&#8221; Wang said.</p></blockquote>
<p>When an economic system intentionally transfers their technological advantages, inventions and intellectual edge to a foreign country so that companies can avoid domestic taxation or onerous regulation, the future adverse and inevitable consequences with such relocations, are preordained.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://rt.com/business/china-us-largest-trading-country-908/">World Bank data</a>, in 2011, the US GDP reached $15 trillion while China totaled $7.3 trillion. Just how long will it take this gap to narrow and surpass the U.S. GDP?</p>
<p>If a comparison of gambling revenue is a leading indicator, just look at <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303640604579295884261629874">Chinese Territory Broaden Lead as Global Casino Capital</a>. &#8220;It now takes Macau&#8217;s gamblers just one day to wager what&#8217;s bet in an entire week on the Las Vegas Strip.&#8221; To make thing even worse, <a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/24418581/nevadas-biggest-casinos-lose-13b-in-2013#axzz2qEphGEse">Nevada&#8217;s biggest casinos lose $1.35B in 2013</a>.<br />
This example demonstrates the extravagant cash flow and disposable income that is circulating in China. Much of this opulence comes from the pocketbooks of struggling Americans, who buy essential or sustainable goods that have a made in China label.</p>
<p>Tech firms transfer the secrets of their products and software to their Chinese partners as the U.S. government subsidized consumer or the remnant middle class, just deepen this destructive cycle. This absurd economic bargain drives the wealth disparity to irrational levels. That is exactly the objective of the globalists, and the rest of us are mere spectators as the Chinese laugh at our stupidity.</p>

<p>Ah, what a better world the Free Traders built. With the rush to the bottom, the commemoration of the NAFTA 20th anniversary is a most hollow celebration. Those who have a memory of an actual economic prosperity, lament that H. Ross Perot’s warnings were ignored. Business literates urged the public to elect Perot as President. Establishment <em>corporatist</em> interests and <em>corruptacrat</em> officials joined forces to write a blueprint for economic consolidation and political futility. The fruits of this endeavor only satisfy the appetites of the select cabal of manipulation.</p>
<p>Heed well the undeniable results.</p>
<p>On The Issues, provides valuable resources. In their section, <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Ross_Perot_Free_Trade.htm">Ross Perot on Free Trade</a>, the perceptive Texan foretold the future in his NAFTA summary.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;NAFTA is really less about trade than it is about investment. Its principal goal is to protect US companies and investors operating in Mexico. The text of the agreement is contained in two volumes covering more than 1,100 pages. The text is mind-numbingly dull. Large portions of it are written in the type of obscure legal terms found on the back of an insurance policy. Buried in the fine print are provisions that will give away American jobs and radically reduce the sovereignty of the US.</p>
<p>[When the Mexican media announced NAFTA, they] did not identify the tiny handful of people in Mexico who would gain the most from this trade pact. They are the 36 businessmen who own Mexico’s 39 largest conglomerates. Collectively, their companies control 54% of Mexico’s Gross National Product. These companies dominate virtually every sector of the Mexican economy of any consequence. When the Mexican government sold off big chunks of Mexico’s state-run companies in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this tiny handful of people quickly acquired control.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Watch the video <a href="http://youtu.be/xQ7kn2-GEmM">Ross Perot in 1992 on NAFTA and the &#8220;Giant Sucking Sound&#8221;</a>, and appreciate the difference in prosperity if these destructive trade agreements, that solely benefit the globalist, never came about.</p>
<p>The Business Insider in <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/looks-like-ross-perot-was-right-about-the-giant-sucking-sound-2011-2/lixzz2pcehosVo">Looks Like Ross Perot Was Right About The &#8220;Giant Sucking Sound&#8221;</a>, acknowledges the incontestable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Both of Perot’s opponents (George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton) argued that NAFTA would create jobs in the U.S. because of business expansion.</p>
<p>However, the goods balance of trade for the U.S. with Mexico has been negative and steadily growing over the years. In 2010 it amounted to $61.6 billion, which was 9.5% of the total goods trade deficit last year.</p>
<p>So Perot has been vindicated in his opinion; expanded free trade has not been accompanied by an increase in jobs in the U.S. relative to the vast numbers of jobs created in the rest of the world as NAFTA became just a stepping stone on the pathway to global commerce.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

</div>
<p>From a different political persuasion, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/press-release-NAFTA-at-20.pdf">Public Citizen</a> comes to much of the same conclusion in their research paper, NAFTA at 20: One Million Lost U.S. Jobs, Higher Income Inequality, Doubled Agriculture Trade Deficit With Mexico and Canada, Displacement and Instability in Mexico, and Corporate Attacks on Environmental Laws.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Given NAFTA’s devastating outcomes, few of the corporations or think tanks that sold it as a boon for all of us in the 1990s like to talk about it, but the reality is that their promises failed, the opposite occurred and millions of people were severely harmed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8pjWcnNZWZw" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proponents of NAFTA often claimed that the Mexican economy would make great strides. In the video, <a href="http://youtu.be/8pjWcnNZWZw">20 Years on, Mexico is NAFTA&#8217;s Biggest Lie</a>, the facts demonstrate a very different record. The Campaign for the Future adds to this conclusion in <a href="http://ourfuture.org/20131217/nafta-20-years-of-spin-for-americas-failed-globalization-model">NAFTA: 20 Years of Spin for America’s Failed Globalization Model</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;NAFTA’s promoters also claimed that NAFTA would be a huge benefit to Mexico, stemming illegal immigration to the U.S., drug trafficking and other corruption, and other ills. (How is that working out?) But even with Mexico’s $1 trillion NAFTA surplus with the U.S., Mexico still suffers a chronic global trade deficit as China and other countries use it as a back door to the U.S. Last year Mexico paid $60 billion for imports of mostly manufactured goods from China while earning only $6 billion from exports of mostly mineral and agricultural commodities to China.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Folks, this globalization model flops for the most simple of all reasons. Allowing the world economy to reward the neo-feudal system produces only societies that control their populations as serfs. Economists and business journalists that ignore the collapse of real income purchasing power by the vast majority, practice their trade for the conglomerate captains of commerce.</p>
<p>The reason that Free Trade agreement swindles, detested by the suffering public, is such a dramatic failure is that twenty years of diminished wealth hits everyone’s pocketbooks. No longer can the dreadful results from the hidden fine print of treaty documents stay secret from the impoverished middle and underclass.</p>
<p>People are now aware that the former &#8220;<em>giant sucking sound</em>&#8221; has turned into a universal welfare dependency economy of lower expectations. As the global financial system descends into bankruptcy and default, the United States economy will fall even faster than that of poorer nations.</p>
<p>NAFTA is a prime contributor to the dramatic trade deficits that suffocates entrepreneurial ventures that could expand productive growth and achieve a higher standard of living. A Corporatocracy economic system, in union with authoritarian governmental regimes, seeks to rule a world of docile plantation peons.</p>
<p>What is next? <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/022204.html">CAFTA: Wall Street vs Main Street</a>, proposed back in 2004, and now we have <a href="http://www.batr.org/corporatocracy/112013.html">TPP</a> and <a href="http://www.batr.org/corporatocracy/112713.html">TTIP</a> on the agenda. The last two decades did not satisfy the greed of the plutocrats. Only total control of transnational business traffic will complete the international trade agreement deals.Absorbing the whole of transaction cash flow into a system of strictly regulated commerce is the economic end game of the globalists. When will people rebel against this bankster’s usury model of business? The darling companies that are approved NAFTA ventures are beholden to the worldwide elites of economic fascism. Perot was right on mark. Oppose future free trade treaties.</p>

<p>Corporate monopolies are not new, but ownership of patented grain seeds connotes that the control of the food supply is in the grasp of a private company. <a href="http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-monsanto">US supreme court rules in favor of Monsanto</a>, &#8220;that a farmer in Indiana violated the intellectual property rights of the agricultural biotechnology titan Monsanto when he regrew the company’s genetically modified and herbicide-resistant soybean seeds by planting second-generation seeds.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fooddemocracynow.org/blog/2013/may/13/food_democracy_now_slams_supreme_court_Monsanto/">Dave Murphy</a>, Executive Director and founder of Food Democracy Now, explains the ultimate outcome.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the corporate takeover of our food supply, in a huge win for Monsanto, and a major loss for America’s farmers and consumers. Monsanto has long engaged in an effort to subvert family farmers that do not use their genetically-engineered seeds and the Court has now handed corporations even more control over what our families eat.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/N6_DbVdVo-k" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stats on the prevailing position of this threat, compiled in <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_28059.cfm">U.S. and Monsanto Dominate Global Market for GM Seeds</a>, are alarming. If that is not enough, the video <a href="http://youtu.be/N6_DbVdVo-k">The World According to Monsanto</a> along with the <a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-world-according-to-monsanto/">Documentary</a>, provides the evidence that has long gone ignored.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing they are leaving untouched: the mustard, the okra, the bringe oil, the rice, the cauliflower. Once they have established the norm: that seed can be owned as their property, royalties can be collected. We will depend on them for every seed we grow of every crop we grow. If they control seed, they control food, they know it – it&#8217;s strategic. It&#8217;s more powerful than bombs. It&#8217;s more powerful than guns.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>America lives in the dark ages when it comes to ingesting the poison from GMO designer crops. Ellen Brown provides the proof in, <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/26/monsanto-the-tpp-and-global-food-dominance/">Monsanto, the TPP and Global Food Dominance</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/08/what-are-gmos-and-why-should-i-care">Sixty to seventy percent of the foods in US supermarkets</a>　are now genetically modified. By contrast, in at least 26 other countries—including Switzerland, Australia, Austria, China, India, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Greece, Bulgaria, Poland, Italy, Mexico and Russia—<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/176863/twenty-six-countries-ban-gmos-why-wont-us">GMOs are totally or partially banned</a>; and significant restrictions on GMOs exist in about sixty other countries.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Collusion among the courts, regulators, agency administrators, lobbyists (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/monsanto-blanche-lincoln-_n_4110750.html">Monsanto Hires Former Sen. Blanche Lincoln As Lobbyist</a>), politicians and the free trade interests, to facilitate the adoption of a biological genetic frankenstein diet is evident in, <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/9:why-monsanto-always-wins">Why Monsanto Always Wins</a> by Mike Ludwig.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;The recent approval of Monsanto&#8217;s Roundup Ready alfalfa is one of most divisive controversies in American agriculture, but in 2003, it was simply the topic at hand in a string of emails between the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Monsanto. In the emails, federal regulators and Monsanto officials shared edits to a list of the USDA&#8217;s questions about Monsanto&#8217;s original petition to fully legalize the alfalfa. Later emails show a USDA regulator accepted Monsanto&#8217;s help with drafting the initial environmental assessment (EA) of the alfalfa and planned to &#8220;cut and paste&#8221; parts of Monsanto&#8217;s revised petition right into the government&#8217;s assessment.&#8221;

<p>How many times will the merger of corporatist influence with governmental cooperation put the public at risk, before this insidious process is recognized as systemic corruption?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xE-5Y0w-zto" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever else you think of former Congressman Dennis Kucinich, he has the guts to confront &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/xE-5Y0w-zto">The Influence And Corruption Of The Political Process By Monsanto</a>&#8220;, in a hard hitting video. No wonder he was gerrymandered out of office.Ms. Brown continues and injects political influence into the equation that will virtually guarantee Monsanto’s profits as they feed poisonous food to the consumer.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The chief agricultural negotiator for the US is the former Monsanto lobbyist, Islam Siddique. If ratified the <a href="http://www.batr.org/corporatocracy/112013.html">TPP</a> would impose punishing regulations that give multinational corporations unprecedented right to demand taxpayer compensation for policies that corporations deem a barrier to their profits.. . . They are carefully crafting the TPP to insure that citizens of the involved countries have no control over food safety, what they will be eating, where it is grown, the conditions under which food is grown and the use of herbicides and pesticides.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The fraud perpetrated in <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-seeds-of-suicide-how-monsanto-destroys-farming/5329947">The Seeds Of Suicide: How Monsanto Destroys Farming</a>, is an affront to the Creator, even his children are blind to the consequences of designing seeds that require a license to plant.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Patents on seed are illegitimate because putting a toxic gene into a plant cell is not &#8220;creating&#8221; or &#8220;inventing&#8221; a plant. These are seeds of deception — the deception that Monsanto is the creator of seeds and life; the deception that while Monsanto sues farmers and traps them in debt, it pretends to be working for farmers’ welfare, and the deception that GMOs feed the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The article, <a href="http://batr.org/gulag/082210.html">Genetic Modified Foods &#8211; Senate Bill S510</a>, examines the highest of all stakes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Control of the food chain is a concern that crosses all ideological perspectives. The most essential of all human rights is the effective ability of access and ingestion of nutrients that are necessary to sustain life. Forced feeding of toxicants, as the only foodstuff available to the masses, is a true crime against humanity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>F. William Engdahl in an interview with RT, <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/monsato-manipulation-food-chain-799/">‘Monsanto is the metaphor for genetic manipulation, food chain control’</a>, nicely sums up the complicity in creating a NWO food supply.</p>
<blockquote><p>RT: Why is the US government so keen to protect the interests of Monsanto?</p>
<p>WE: I think this is the strategic interest of the US agribusiness lobby, the lobby of Bush senior as president in 1992. Monsanto went to the White House and had a closed-door meeting with Bush, and got him to agree to make sure there are no government tests whatsoever on the health and safety of GMO products before they were released to the commercial public. That was called the doctrine of &#8216;substantial equivalence&#8217;– it’s a fraudulent doctrine if you just analyze the name, it’s by no means scientifically rigorous.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Globalist objective to reduce the earthly population coincides with Monsanto’s strategy to strangle the food supply. The world their &#8216;substantial equivalence&#8217; envisions has no equality among humans. The roundup has begun and the survivors will be few.</p>

<p>The other leg to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Free_Trade_Area">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a>. In <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19223">Part I</a> scrutiny of the TPP proposal indicates that standards of monopoly amalgamation far exceeded efforts to advance actual competitive trade. From the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/fact-sheets/2013/june/wh-ttip">White House Fact Sheet</a>, the aims of the TTIP are:</p>
<blockquote><p>• Further open EU markets, increasing the $458 billion in goods and private services the United States exported in 2012 to the EU, our largest export market.</p>
<p>• Strengthen rules-based investment to grow the world’s largest investment relationship. The United States and the EU already maintain a total of nearly $3.7 trillion in investment in each other’s economies (as of 2011).</p>
<p>• Eliminate all tariffs on trade.</p>
<p>• Tackle costly &#8220;behind the border&#8221; non-tariff barriers that impede the flow of goods, including agricultural goods.</p>
<p>• Obtain improved market access on trade in services.</p>
<p>• Significantly reduce the cost of differences in regulations and standards by promoting greater compatibility, transparency, and cooperation, while maintaining our high levels of health, safety, and environmental protection.</p>
<p>• Develop rules, principles, and new modes of cooperation on issues of global concern, including intellectual property and market-based disciplines addressing state-owned enterprises and discriminatory localization barriers to trade.</p>
<p>• Promote the global competitiveness of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Opponents of TTIP echo the same loss of national sovereignty, similar to the reservations with TPP. The <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/06/opponents-question-proposed-trans-atlantic-trade-deal/">IPS-Inter Press Service</a> reports on the concerns and consequences.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The claims that this deal will somehow be an economic cure-all and generate significant growth are simply not supported by any reliable evidence,&#8221; Lori Wallach, director of <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/06/opponents-question-proposed-trans-atlantic-trade-deal/www.citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>‘s Global Trade Watch.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But we do know that the talks are based on the demands of U.S. and EU corporations that have been pushing for decades to eliminate the best consumer, environmental and financial standards on either side of the Atlantic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Also stated in the IPS account is that &#8220;Tariffs between the U.S. and E.U. are already low, and critic’s note that what the deal really seeks to accomplish is the removal of &#8220;non tariff barriers&#8221; (also referred to as &#8220;trade irritants&#8221;).&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Non-tariff barriers is a commonly-used euphemism which refers to the array of financial, environmental, health and other policies which the public has put in place to safeguard its own interests,&#8221; Ben Beachy, a research director for Public Citizen, told IPS.</p>
<p>Under T-TIP, standards such as those mentioned by Beachy would be &#8220;converged&#8221;, so that regulations from state to state would be more closely aligned. Supporters of the deal say this uniformity would facilitate trade, but Beachy contended that the greater effect would be to lower regulation levels to a point that &#8220;democratic electorates would never stand for.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Not surprising, the European Commission seeks to rely upon esoteric and speculative economic models to project that increased growth will ensue, while avoiding the hard political concerns in <a href="http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/september/tradoc_151787.pdf">The Economic Analysis Explained</a> study - The overall impact of TTIP.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The CEPR study predicts that an ambitious TTIP deal would increase the size of the EU economy around €120 billion (or 0.5% of GDP) and the US by €95 billion (or 0.4% of GDP). This would be a permanent increase in the amount of wealth that the European and American economies can produce every year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<div>The video, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZXBoQV43p0">Economic effects of a transatlantic free trade deal (TTIP)</a> projects the winners and losers, while disclosing that individual countries would be relinquishing their own policies to an unelected economic bureaucracy.The flaws of any corporate or trade delegation research is that the conclusions are baked into the assumptions. Acknowledging the formation of a unified supra-national trade and commerce authority to implement economic decisions is usually outside the parameters of such studies. So when a Bertelsmann Foundation survey admits the obvious, it becomes noteworthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In some respects, TTIP could be considered as a new sort of trade agreement—one that provides a framework for mutual regulatory decision-making and sets high standards that other countries outside the US and Europe can eventually join as well. This framework approach allows negotiators to quickly conclude an historic tariff and investment deal and leave the door open to future streamlining on those policy differences that might be too difficult to bridge today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to appreciate the radical departure from national regimes and the transfer of administration and authorization of law by treaty, through regulation into an economic federation of non-governmental governance, is startling.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jWi497jqkU0" height="315" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grasp the vast extend and scope of this betrayal, in the skillful presentation on the YouTube, AVN | US &amp; EU Merger - <a href="http://youtu.be/jWi497jqkU0">TransAtlantic Trade &amp; Investment Partnership</a>. The banksters controlled media and press remain virtually silent and tightlipped about the economic coordination into a Corporatocracy of elites control. The New World Order consolidated economic structure, progresses with every trade treaty.</p>
<p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership have the objective of merging the American economy into and under the European Union model of supranational dictates. If this were not the path to betrayal, what would you call it? With the fallout from the nuclear option by &#8220;Democrat Dictator&#8221; Harry Reid, the filibuster will not stop ratification of treaties in the Senate.</p>
<p>False promises of job expansion are nothing but hideous promises for the uninitiated or unintelligent. The TTIP is just another tactic to maintain and expand the Anglo –American hegemony. Only favored companies that operate under the oversight and protection of central bankers, benefit from monopolistic trade arrangements.</p>
<p>Protective tariffs built America. Free Trade agreements are destroying the middle class. Increasing economic activity under a framework that effectively excludes the next generation of the working population only fattens the Plutocrats appetites for even more dominance.</p>
<p>The TTIP assurance to &#8220;<em>Promote the global competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises</em>&#8221; is a total fraud. Ask any business executive, the commerce race is stacked in favor of the corporatist. Then pose the same question to a small business owner, who knows they seldom even get the chance to play the international trade game at all.</p>

<p><em>Control</em> oil and <em>you control</em> nations,” said US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the 1970s.  “C<em>ontrol food</em> and <em>you control the people</em>.”</p>
<p>Global food control has nearly been achieved, by reducing seed diversity with GMO (genetically modified) seeds that are distributed by only a few transnational corporations. But this agenda has been implemented at grave cost to our health; and if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) passes, control over not just our food but our health, our environment and our financial system will be in the hands of transnational corporations.</p>
<p><b>Profits Before Populations</b></p>
<p>Genetic engineering has made proprietary control possible over the seeds on which the world’s food supply depends. <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/artman2/uploads/1/May2011_Huber.pdf">According to an Acres USA interview</a> of plant pathologist Don Huber, Professor Emeritus at Purdue University, two modified traits account for practically all of the genetically modified crops grown in the world today. One involves insect resistance. The other, more disturbing modification involves insensitivity to glyphosate-based herbicides (plant-killing chemicals). Often known as Roundup after the best-selling Monsanto product of that name, glyphosate poisons everything in its path except plants genetically modified to resist it.</p>
<p>Glyphosate-based herbicides are now the most commonly used herbicides in the world. Glyphosate is an essential partner to the GMOs that are the principal business of the burgeoning biotech industry. Glyphosate is a “broad-spectrum” herbicide that destroys indiscriminately, not by killing unwanted plants directly but by tying up access to critical nutrients.</p>
<p>Because of the insidious way in which it works, it has been sold as a relatively benign replacement for the devastating earlier dioxin-based herbicides. But a barrage of experimental data has now shown glyphosate and the GMO foods incorporating it to pose serious dangers to health. Compounding the risk is the toxicity of “inert” ingredients used to make glyphosate more potent. Researchers have found, for example, that <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/26/monsanto-the-tpp-and-global-food-dominance/..:..:..:Weed%20killer%20kills%20human%20cells.%20Study%20intensifies%20debate%20over%20'inert'%20ingredients.%20%25D1%20Environmental%20Health%20News.htm">the surfactant POEA can kill human cells</a>, particularly embryonic, placental and umbilical cord cells. But these risks have been conveniently ignored.</p>
<p>The widespread use of GMO foods and glyphosate herbicides helps explain the anomaly that <a href="http://pgpf.org/Chart-Archive/0006_health-care-oecd">the US spends over twice as much per capita on healthcare</a> as the average developed country, yet it is rated far down the scale of the world’s healthiest populations. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/new-health-rankings-of-17-nations-us-is-dead-last/267045/">The World Health Organization has ranked</a> the US LAST out of 17 developed nations for overall health.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/08/what-are-gmos-and-why-should-i-care">Sixty to seventy percent of the foods in US supermarkets</a> are now genetically modified. By contrast, in at least 26 other countries—including Switzerland, Australia, Austria, China, India, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Greece, Bulgaria, Poland, Italy, Mexico and Russia—<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/176863/twenty-six-countries-ban-gmos-why-wont-us">GMOs are totally or partially banned</a>; and significant restrictions on GMOs exist in about sixty other countries.</p>
<p>A ban on GMO and glyphosate use might go far toward improving the health of Americans. But the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a global trade agreement for which the Obama Administration has sought Fast Track status, would block that sort of cause-focused approach to the healthcare crisis.</p>
<p><b>Roundup’s Insidious Effects</b></p>
<p>Roundup-resistant crops escape being killed by glyphosate, but they do not avoid absorbing it into their tissues. Herbicide-tolerant crops have substantially higher levels of herbicide residues than other crops. In fact, many countries have had to increase their legally allowable levels—by up to 50 times—in order to accommodate the introduction of GM crops. In the European Union, <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/26/monsanto-the-tpp-and-global-food-dominance/..:..:..:..:..:..:..:..:AppData:Local:Microsoft:Windows:Temporary%20Internet%20Files:OLK7F08:Why_Glyphosate_Should_Be_Banned_(illustrated).pdf">residues in food are set to rise 100-150 times</a> if a new proposal by Monsanto is approved. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/move-over-round-up-usda-approves-2nd-gen-gmos-that-can-withstand-even-deadlier-herbicide-09012013">herbicide-tolerant “super-weeds” have adapted to the chemical</a>, requiring even more toxic doses and new toxic chemicals to kill the plant.</p>
<p>Human enzymes are affected by glyphosate just as plant enzymes are: the chemical blocks the uptake of manganese and other essential minerals. Without those minerals, we cannot properly metabolize our food. That helps explain the rampant epidemic of obesity in the United States. People eat and eat in an attempt to acquire the nutrients that are simply not available in their food.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416">According to researchers Samsell and Seneff</a> in <i><a href="http://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy/special_issues/biosemiotic_entropy">Biosemiotic Entropy: Disorder, Disease, and Mortality</a></i> (April 2013):</p>
<blockquote><p>Glyphosate’s inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is an overlooked component of its toxicity to mammals. CYP enzymes play crucial roles in biology . . . . Negative impact on the body is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body. Consequences are most of the diseases and conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.</p></blockquote>
<p>More than 40 diseases have been linked to glyphosate use, and more keep appearing. In September 2013, <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11150351">the National University of Rio Cuarto, Argentina, published research</a> finding that glyphosate enhances the growth of fungi that produce aflatoxin B1, one of the most carcinogenic of substances. A doctor from Chaco, Argentina, told Associated Press, “We’ve gone from a pretty healthy population to one with a high rate of cancer, birth defects and illnesses seldom seen before.” Fungi growths have increased significantly in US corn crops.</p>
<p>Glyphosate has also done serious damage to the environment. <a href="http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Why_Glyphosate_Should_Be_Banned_PDF.php">According to an October 2012 report by the Institute of Science in Society</a>:</p>
<p>Agribusiness claims that glyphosate and glyphosate-tolerant crops will improve crop yields, increase farmers’ profits and benefit the environment by reducing pesticide use. Exactly the opposite is the case. . . . [T]he evidence indicates that glyphosate herbicides and glyphosate-tolerant crops have had wide-ranging detrimental effects, including glyphosate resistant super weeds, virulent plant (and new livestock) pathogens, reduced crop health and yield, harm to off-target species from insects to amphibians and livestock, as well as reduced soil fertility.</p>
<p><b>Politics Trumps Science</b></p>
<p>In light of these adverse findings, why have Washington and the European Commission continued to endorse glyphosate as safe? Critics point to lax regulations, heavy influence from corporate lobbyists, and a political agenda that has more to do with power and control than protecting the health of the people.</p>
<p>In the ground-breaking 2007 book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0973714727/counterpunchmaga">Seeds of Destruction: The Hidden Agenda of Genetic Manipulation</a></i>, William Engdahl states that global food control and depopulation became US strategic policy under Rockefeller protégé Henry Kissinger. Along with oil geopolitics, they were to be the new “solution” to the threats to US global power and continued US access to cheap raw materials from the developing world. In line with that agenda, the government has shown extreme partisanship in favor of the biotech agribusiness industry, opting for a system in which the industry “voluntarily” polices itself. Bio-engineered foods are treated as “natural food additives,” not needing any special testing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.responsibletechnology.org/posts/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/State-of-the-Science-of-GMO-Health-Risks-sm-.2013.pdf">Jeffrey M. Smith, Executive Director of the Institute for Responsible Technology, confirms</a> that US Food and Drug Administration policy allows biotech companies to determine if their own foods are safe. Submission of data is completely voluntary. He concludes:</p>
<p>In the critical arena of food safety research, the biotech industry is without accountability, standards, or peer-review. They’ve got bad science down to a science.</p>
<p>Whether or not depopulation is an intentional part of the agenda,<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/us-birthrates-plummet-by-310000-babies-responsible-economic-planning-or-shadow-depopulation-07102013">widespread use of GMO and glyphosate is having that result</a>. The endocrine-disrupting properties of glyphosate have been linked to infertility, miscarriage, birth defects and arrested sexual development. In Russian experiments, animals fed GM soy were sterile by the third generation. Vast amounts of farmland soil are also being systematically ruined by the killing of beneficial microorganisms that allow plant roots to uptake soil nutrients.</p>
<p>In Gary Null’s eye-opening documentary <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6OxbpLwEjQ">Seeds of Death: Unveiling the Lies of GMOs</a>, </i>Dr. Bruce Lipton warns, “We are leading the world into the sixth mass extinction of life on this planet. . . . Human behavior is undermining the web of life.”</p>
<p><b>The TPP and International Corporate Control</b></p>
<p>As the devastating conclusions of these and other researchers awaken people globally to the dangers of Roundup and GMO foods, transnational corporations are working feverishly with the Obama administration to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that would strip governments of the power to regulate transnational corporate activities. Negotiations have been kept secret from Congress but not from corporate advisors, 600 of whom have been consulted and know the details. <a href="http://www.nationofchange.org/trans-pacific-partnership-and-monsanto-1372074730">According to Barbara Chicherio</a> in <i>Nation of Change</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) has the potential to become the biggest regional Free Trade Agreement in history. . . .</p>
<p>The chief agricultural negotiator for the US is the former Monsanto lobbyist, Islam Siddique.  If ratified the TPP would impose punishing regulations that give multinational corporations unprecedented right to demand taxpayer compensation for policies that corporations deem a barrier to their profits.</p>
<p>. . . They are carefully crafting the TPP to insure that citizens of the involved countries have no control over food safety, what they will be eating, where it is grown, the conditions under which food is grown and the use of herbicides and pesticides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Food safety is only one of many rights and protections liable to fall to this super-weapon of international corporate control. <a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=9985">In an April 2013 interview on The Real News Network</a>, Kevin Zeese called the TPP “NAFTA on steroids” and “a global corporate coup.” He warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>No matter what issue you care about—whether its wages, jobs, protecting the environment . . . this issue is going to adversely affect it . . . .</p>
<p>If a country takes a step to try to regulate the financial industry or set up a public bank to represent the public interest, it can be sued . . . .</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Return to Nature: Not Too Late</b></p>
<p>There is a safer, saner, more earth-friendly way to feed nations. While Monsanto and US regulators are forcing GM crops on American families, Russian families are showing what can be done with permaculture methods on simple garden plots. <a href="http://naturalhomes.org/naturalliving/russian-dacha.htm">In 2011, 40% of Russia’s food was grown on <i>dachas</i></a> (cottage gardens or allotments). Dacha gardens produced over 80% of the country’s fruit and berries, over 66% of the vegetables, almost 80% of the potatoes and nearly 50% of the nation’s milk, much of it consumed raw. <a href="http://thebovine.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/in-1999-35-million-small-family-plots-produced-90-of-russias-potatoes-77-of-vegetables-87-of-fruits-59-of-meat-49-of-milk-way-to-go-people/">According to Vladimir Megre</a>, author of the best-selling Ringing Cedars Series:</p>
<blockquote><p>Essentially, what Russian gardeners do is demonstrate that gardeners can feed the world – and you do not need any GMOs, industrial farms, or any other technological gimmicks to guarantee everybody’s got enough food to eat. Bear in mind that Russia only has 110 days of growing season per year – so in the US, for example, gardeners’ output could be substantially greater. Today, however, the area taken up by lawns in the US is two times greater than that of Russia’s gardens – and it produces nothing but a multi-billion-dollar lawn care industry.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming_by_country">In the US, only about 0.6 percent</a> of the total agricultural area is devoted to organic farming. This area needs to be vastly expanded if we are to avoid “the sixth mass extinction.” But first, we need to urge our representatives to stop Fast Track, vote no on the TPP, and pursue a global phase-out of glyphosate-based herbicides and GMO foods. Our health, our finances and our environment are at stake.</p>

<p>The latest proof of the Globalist plan for total economic imprisonment is available for scrutiny. Thanks to whistleblowers, the clandestine trade missions of international corporatists must contend with public blowback. Recently, WikiLeaks released the secret negotiated draft text, <a href="http://wikileaks.org/tpp/">Secret Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP)</a>, for the entire TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) Intellectual Property Rights Chapter. The TPP is the largest-ever economic treaty, encompassing nations representing more than 40 per cent of the world’s GDP. The <a href="http://wikileaks.org/tpp//lstart">TPP Agreement</a> along with the <a href="http://wikileaks.org/tpp//lstart">Table of Contents</a> and supportive documentation provides the evidence.</p>
<p>When vastly diverse segments of political perspective unify against this assault on economic self-determination, challenging the very exercise of such agreements is in order. In the article, <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2013/11/16/the-tpp-obamas-dangerous-international-d">Obama&#8217;s Dangerous International Deal</a>, a libertarian viewpoint argues and warns, &#8220;The USTR acknowledges the existence of 29 chapters under negotiation. Only five of these chapters deal directly with trade. The other 24 aim to influence many issues, such as food and environmental standards, intellectual property, and pharmaceutical formularies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perennial progressive Jim Hightower writes in an Alternet article, <a href="http://www.alternet.org/corporate-accountability-and-workplace/corporate-coup-disguise">A Corporate Coup in Disguise</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What if our national leaders told us that communities across America had to eliminate such local programs as Buy Local, Buy American, Buy Green, etc. to allow foreign corporations to have the right to make the sale on any products purchased with our tax dollars? This nullification of our people&#8217;s right to direct expenditures is just one of the horror stories in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the Voice of Russia, not usually known for defending transnational cartels, is an observation that you are not hearing in the financial press, <a href="http://voiceofrussia.com/2013_11_14/Obama-attempting-to-ram-through-unconstitutional-secret-treaty-3479/">Obama attempting to ram through unconstitutional secret treaty</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the US debt at over $200 trillion dollars and their grasp on control slipping, Obama and the corporations that have taken over the US Government are attempting to do anything they can to cling to power and enslave the populace.</p>
<p>The fact that the heads of the governments who are a party to the TPP, would attempt to sign such an all encompassing treaty without the knowledge of their respective governments and their people is a something unheard of an unprecedented in history.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If only free enterprise was the standard of economic commerce, instead of the state-fascism that has developed over the years of the &#8220;Free Trade&#8221; ruse that has destroyed real competition from the financial environment.</p>
<p>Central planning failed miserably in the old Soviet Union, now we are supposed to believe that a corporatist negotiated arrangement with the full backing and force of government bureaucracies is a superior method for prosperity.</p>
<p>Backers of the TPP pact would have you believe that it is a trade agreement. Nile Bowie in an OpEd, <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/tpp-us-secretive-draft-736/">TPP: From corporation personhood to corporate nationhood</a>, has it correct.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although proponents of the TPP may claim that its focus is to help the economies of signatory countries create comprehensive market access, eliminate barriers to trade, improve labor rights and encourage environmental protection, every indication suggests that the wide-ranging agreement intends to maximize dramatically corporate revenues at the expense of public health and safety, <a href="http://rinf.com/alt-news/?s=civil+liberties">civil liberties</a> and national sovereignty.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>From the left leaning Huffington Post, Bruce E. Levine interjects a political aspect in</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-e-levine/the-myth-of-us-democracy-corporatocracy_b_836573.html">The Myth of U.S. Democracy and the Reality of U.S. Corporatocracy</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The truth today, however, is that the United States is neither a democracy nor a republic. Americans are ruled by a corporatocracy: a partnership of &#8220;too-big-to-fail&#8221; corporations, the extremely wealthy elite, and corporate-collaborator government officials.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>World economic agreements vary little based upon partisan political ideology. The corporate business outsourcing strategy and the offshoring of jobs are the inevitable results of every phony trade deal enacted for decades.</p>
<p>The real objective of TPP is to codify in law and treaty the special treatment that favored industries or well-connected interests exert upon the global economy.</p>
<p>When monopolies eliminate competition, the marketplace suffers a crowding out of main street businesses. With the demise of familiar business enterprises, the multinationals expand without hindrance. Entrepreneurial small business is seldom in a position to fill the void left when the muscle of international finance decides to control a business sector.</p>
<p>Setting environmental standards, intellectual property, and pharmaceutical formularies, behind closed doors endangers the public. Imposing rabid global warming penalties, perpetual expanding of copyright privileges and banning natural holistic supplements and vitamins, all intend to strip choice from consumers or to burden the population with irrational tax obligations.</p>
<p>In an outstanding account, by Don Quijones his article, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/11/the-global-corporatocracy-is-almost-fully-operational.html/lguZBJCoVTvTvEDjo.99">The Global Corporatocracy is Almost Fully Operational</a>, provided the essential context and ultimate consequence.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The new generation of trade treaties goes far beyond what was envisaged for NAFTA and GATT. What they ultimately seek is to transfer what little remains of our national sovereignty to the headquarters of the world’s largest multinational conglomerates. In short, it is the ultimate coup de grâce of the ultimate coup d’état. Not a single shot will be fired, yet almost all power will be seized and transferred into private hands — and all of it facilitated by our elected representatives who, by signing these treaties, will be permanently abdicating their responsibilities to represent and protect the interests of their voting constituencies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>If you have the courage to face the dire implications of this globalist scheme, view the video <a href="http://youtu.be/KtBJwQRSooI">TPP &amp; One World Government</a>. The bare honesty may be too much for the “PC” crowd.</p>
<p>Advocates of a merchant based economy are inherently in opposition to globalism. Yet, this round of integration under cartel syndicate governance is part of an end game for world economic consolidation. The Corporatocracy that rules over purported democratic countries is the real power overseer that maintains the indentured servant plantation. The comptrollers of the credit dictatorship maintain the financial system for the ultimate controllers.</p>
<p>In the next episode, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is analyzed. Complementing the TPP, both accords will place the yoke of even greater mastery over the economies of once sovereign nations.</p>

				<p>September 11, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18724#respond" title="Comment on Forecasts of a Doomed Economy"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="18724 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=18724">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Contrary investing used to be a profitable endeavor. Things have changed. The doom business is in full swing as many financial prognosticators seek to hedge their normally ecstatic outlooks in order to sell their advice. When tragedy becomes a consensus sentiment, it used to be the time to buy. Now that formula has to factor in a different set of risks. Namely the incoherent political intrusions and stimulus-austerity gyrations has to head the list. Has forecasting become a lost art or did it evolve into an algorithm supercomputer project? In either case, the doom factor is sure to continue to be a stable from the Cassandra circle as long as an economic recovery allures the former members of the middle class.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the bulls want you to believe that economic indicators are guardedly improving. <a href="http://econintersect.com/wordpress/?page_id=409">The Global Economic Intersection</a> boldly portends.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our September 2013 Economic Forecast shows a change of trend. Many portions of our economic model started to expand over the previous month’s baseline.</p>
<p>We continue to warn that consumer spending increases are expanding at a much faster pace than income – and that eventually either a jump in income or a fall in consumption must occur to close this gap. This remains an economic headwind for 3Q2013.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Surely, equities are back in vogue as spending flows. Yet, Tom Stevenson writing in The Telegraph recommends <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/tom-stevenson/10293652/Take-forecasts-with-a-pinch-of-salt...or-move-to-Omaha.html">Take forecasts with a pinch of salt&#8230;or move to Omaha</a>, for those who have the courage to bet their money on picking particular stocks.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The problem for investors is that very often, at the individual stock level, good news is not built into valuations for some time after it has become publicly available.</p>
<p>This means that contrary to markets as a whole, where it can be better to travel than to arrive, good company news can trigger sustained outperformance as investors slowly accept the improved outlook.</p>
<p>This might sound like a counsel of despair for investors, but it shouldn&#8217;t. Awareness of the limitations of knowledge is actually strangely liberating when it comes to managing your investments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Woe is me, what opportunities are missed by sitting on the sidelines? Almost moves one to subscribe to some of those pricy newsletters. But before you brush off the dust on your wallet, heed the lesson that Ian R. Campbell references when he asks<a href="http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/50740">Economic forecasting – how credible?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Frequently in this Newsletter I have said I believe that many economists wrongly advance a theoretical forecast framework based on irrelevant history when reaching conclusions on what is prospectively going to happen in any particular economy at any given point in time – and hence many economists inherently are doomed to get things wrong before they put pen to paper.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The prediction record of most experts is dismal at best. Therefore, when Charles Colgan, former chair of Maine’s Consensus Economic Forecasting Commission is cited in <a href="http://whitrichardson.bangordailynews.com/2013/01/08/maine-business/on-economic-forecasting-as-a-forlorn-hope/">On economic forecasting as a ‘forlorn hope’</a>. He &#8220;humbly admitting he’s botched the past several annual forecasts, Colgan compared himself to Charlie Brown, ever the optimist, who repeatedly tries to kick the football being held by his friend Lucy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, the small investor is just as dimwitted as Charlie Brown. The fate of most plays in the <a href="http://batr.org/markets/">M A R K E T S</a>, are sealed before they get started. In a corporatist economy, the balance sheets of companies swell, but the return on equity to stockowners often falls short.</p>
<p>One needs to admit, before placing funds in the hands of Wall Street money managers, that the game is speculation, not investing. Fortunes are made by knowing the insider decisions before the public is even aware of the news that a stock is in play. Even bigger sums are extracted from shorting a vulnerable public company as the vultures sense a ripe carcass.</p>
<p>Any thinking citizen with even a modest understanding of economics and commerce must conclude that the consumer patience is still gravely ill. Sophistication in interpreting trend forecasts is not necessary when <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/06/autos/age-of-cars/index.html">CNNMoney</a> provides the evidence. &#8220;The average age of vehicles on America&#8217;s roads has reached an all-time high of 11.4 years, according to the market research firm Polk. And that average age is sure to keep climbing, the firm said.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the financial sages deem the consumer superfluous and define a healthy economy by a growing public sector, the prospects for a doomed system are inevitable.</p>

<p>Reading such international financial establishment pronouncements usually provide a reassuring crutch even when countries are going bankrupt. Telling as it is for the spin you are meant to accept, the forecast for personal success in the investment jungle is wrath with predators of all species.</p>
<p>Now all this caution is moot if the global economy enters into a new golden age. Duplicating the prosperity of the industrial revolution with a cyber collection matrix that digitally spies on propitiatory business secrets is not exactly the formula that generates wealth, which is shared by the masses.</p>
<p>The incomparable Paul Craig Roberts is the best political and economic forecaster. In his 2011 article, <a href="http://economyincrisis.org/content/how-economy-was-lost-doomed-myths-free-trade">How the Economy was Lost, Doomed by the Myths of Free Trade</a>, he explains the basic reason for the doomed forthcoming financial meltdown end game.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As the issuers of swaps were not required to reserve against them, and as there is no limit to the number of swaps, the payouts could easily exceed the net worth of the issuer.</p>
<p>This was the most shameful and most mindless form of speculation. Gamblers were betting hands that they could not cover. The US regulators fled their posts. The American financial institutions abandoned all integrity. As a consequence, American financial institutions and rating agencies are trusted nowhere on earth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the forecast that you can bank on.</p>

<p>In no particular order:</p>
<p><strong>One</strong>: Give the appearance of unifying the country behind the President, who “did his job the right way,” by going to Congress for approval. This elevates Obama’s ratings and, by inference, suggests that his other programs should be accorded more merit. A wartime president always gains more support.</p>
<p><strong>Two</strong>: Give the people an adrenaline rush. The effect should never be underestimated. Cleanses the pores, cleans the slate, and relieves frustration by proxy, temporarily…if you have very little access to your cerebral functions.</p>
<p><strong>Three</strong>: In this case, winning Congressional approval reinstates the illusion, for a few moments, that we are a Constitutional Republic, with a government dedicated to justice.</p>
<p><strong>Four</strong>: Help fulfill the long-planned US-Israeli agenda of destabilizing Syria and causing it to partition into warring and chaotic ethnic factions.</p>
<p><strong>Five</strong>: Stop the construction of a natural gas pipeline across Syria, which would boost Iran’s economy by sending Iranian gas to Europe. Iran’s economy must be torpedoed.</p>
<p><strong>Six</strong>: Send a message throughout the Middle East that the US is all-powerful and the dollar must remain the reserve currency in all oil transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Seven</strong>: Feed the US military-industrial complex, which demands wars.</p>
<p><strong>Eight</strong>: <a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/what-is-the-end-game-in-the-middle-east/" target="_blank">Aid the long-term goal of Globalism/Free Trade</a>, which involves putting the entire Middle East into unresolvable debt and suffering…and then coming in with outside elite bankster financing, to rebuild the entire region and own it, lock, stock, and barrel.</p>
<p><strong>Nine</strong>: Distract Americans from a number of scandals, including: Benghazi, Fast&amp;Furious, IRS non-profit division crimes, NSA spying, the continuing failed war in Afghanistan, and a tanking domestic economy with more and more people living below the poverty line.</p>
<p>None of these reasons has anything to do with “punishing Assad for using chemical weapons.” In any case, that whole scenario has been thrown into extreme doubt.</p>
<p>Your government at work.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/evilmoreless3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/evilmoreless3.jpg" align="left" /></a>After then-Congressman Joe Scarborough convinced me to endorse the neocon Bob Dole for President back in 1996, I vowed to myself that I would  never vote for “the lesser of two evils” again. I haven’t; and I won’t.</p>
<p>Almost anytime one hears someone talking about voting for the lesser of two evils, it always means voting for a Republican instead of a third party or independent candidate. The argument is always the same: he or she (the third party candidate) cannot win. Therefore, voting for someone you presume cannot win is “wasting” your vote. I used to believe that, too, but no more.</p>
<p>One could even make the argument that voting for an unprincipled neocon Republican is actually voting for the greater evil, not the lesser. It seems we lose far more liberties under Republican administrations than under Democrat ones. That does not mean that Democrat presidents care more for the Constitution and limited government than Republican presidents. It simply means when Republicans occupy the White House, rank and file conservatives and freedomists go fast asleep. I mean deep sleep. I mean extended hibernation. The two administrations of G.W. Bush are prime examples.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign policy and the burgeoning police state at home, there is no distinguishable difference between Bush and Barack Obama. None! Except for the fact that with a Democrat in office, conservatives, Christians, and freedomists are much more alert and quick to oppose the administration’s draconian policies, whereas, with a Republican in office, those same people sit back and totally ignore identical policies. Yes, sometimes voting for a Democrat might be voting for the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>I personally witnessed an election in which a vote for the Republican was not just a vote for the lesser of two evils; it was a vote for a politically evil candidate over a politically righteous candidate. I use the words “evil” and “righteous,” not in the true spiritual sense, of course, but in the overall political result of the two candidate’s positions on the issues.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the US Senate race in South Carolina in 2008. The Republican candidate was the pro-war, pro-police state, pro-big government, anti-Constitution incumbent Lindsey Graham. Lindsey Graham is the personification of everything that is wrong with Washington, D.C. Mind you, Graham is a US Senator from South Carolina. There are probably more evangelical Christians, more Christian schools, and more Christian influence per capita and per square mile in South Carolina than in any State in the country. Bar none! And Lindsey Graham is the best that South Carolina can send to Washington, D.C.? Egad!</p>
<p>In 2008, I was running for POTUS as the Constitution Party candidate. I spent some quality time in South Carolina during that campaign. I had previously spent time in the Palmetto State campaigning for Congressman Ron Paul. What I’m saying is I spent quite a bit of time in South Carolina that year.</p>
<p>While I was in South Carolina, I was introduced to the US Senate Democrat candidate Bob Conley. I spent much time getting to know Bob. I could not find one issue over which he and I disagreed. Bob was as straight as a gun barrel politically speaking. He was an awesome candidate. So, while I was in South Carolina, I was happy to publicly endorse Bob for that US Senate seat. In that race, a vote for the Republican candidate was to vote for the only “evil” candidate in the race. Yet, conservatives and Christians by the tens of thousands cast their vote for Graham simply because he was a Republican. You see, voting for the “lesser of two evils” does not apply to anything except voting for a Republican.</p>
<p>We had a similar situation here in Montana in 2012 for a State office race when there was only a choice between a liberal Democrat and a Libertarian Party candidate. No Republican was in the race. Without question, the “lesser of two evils” vote (in the jargon of so-called conservative Republicans) would have been cast for the Libertarian Party candidate. But what happened? A sizeable percentage of Republicans didn’t vote at all. They refused to vote for “the lesser of two evils.”  This proves, once again, that the issue is not about voting for the “lesser of two evils,” it is only about voting for Republicans.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are numerous people who treat Democrat candidates the same way. It doesn’t matter one whit how unfaithful the person might be to Democrat positions, if there is a “D” behind the name, they will vote for him or her. President George Washington was right: this kind of loyalty to any political party is a bane of freedom.</p>
<p>Back to the aforementioned 1996 Presidential campaign: after leaving the airport where Scarborough and I had appeared alongside Bob Dole, I felt sick to my stomach. My radio talk show at that time was on a meteoric rise and I had enthusiastically campaigned for Pat Buchanan. I even hosted a major event for him in the Florida Panhandle during that campaign. I knew Bob Dole was no conservative; I knew he would never be faithful to the principles that I felt so deeply about. But, in the name of defeating Bill Clinton, I allowed Joe Scarborough to talk me into throwing my support behind Dole. As I walked away from that press conference, I vowed to myself, “Never again will I vote for the lesser of two evils.”</p>
<p>Now, that cliché, the lesser of two evils, means different things to different people. So, for sake of clarity, let me tell you what it means to me. I have a six-point litmus test. I don’t care whether the candidate is male or female, black or white, Democrat of Republican, conservative or liberal, Christian or pagan, if he or she violates fidelity to one of more of these principles, I will not vote for him or her; I don’t care how “evil” the opponent might be.</p>
<p><strong>Life</strong></p>
<p>I will not vote for someone who would support or facilitate the legalization of abortion&#8211;a Republican candidacy notwithstanding. If neither major party candidate is pro-life, I will vote for someone else in the race that is, or I will leave my ballot blank on that race. I have done that numerous times. I will not vote for anyone who supports the killing of innocent unborn babies. Period!</p>
<p><strong>Marriage</strong></p>
<p>I will not vote for a candidate (from any political party) who would support the attempt to redefine marriage as being between anyone except between a man and a woman. Marriage is a divine institution and our Creator has already defined it. Government didn’t invent marriage; and government cannot re-invent it. To tell you the truth, I don’t think government has any business being involved in marriage to any degree.</p>
<p>Mind you, I’m not talking about civil unions. That is another matter altogether. I have my opinions on that subject, but that issue does not rise to the level of marriage. And I most certainly am not talking about granting power to the government to invade people’s privacy. I don’t want government in the bedroom, living room, kitchen, or closet.</p>
<p><strong>The Warfare State</strong></p>
<p>Ever since World War II, and the advent of the United Nations, America’s foreign policy has been the antithesis of the principles of liberty and independence. Foreign interventionism, nation-building, and wars of aggression are the enemies of freedom. The vision of America’s founders was one of free trade and good will with all and foreign entanglements with none. Modern American leaders have completely inverted that concept. Now, it is foreign entanglements with all and free trade (the so-called “free trade” agreements in modern times are not free trade at all but government-manipulated trade) and good will with none.</p>
<p>The so-called “war on terror” (along with the “war on drugs”) is the cornerstone of all of the infringements upon the liberties of the American people at home and the excuse given to justify all sorts of military aggression abroad. The “war on terror” is actually a war on the liberties of the American citizenry. The “war on terror” has made us less free and less safe.  And if it continues unabated, it will result in the enslavement of the American people.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will not vote for any candidate for public office, regardless of political party, that does not understand the evilness of the Warfare State and that will not aggressively oppose it. This includes those who support sending US military forces around the globe to fight undeclared, unprovoked wars, those who support the use of drones for the purpose of military assassination, and those who support interfering in the internal affairs of foreign countries without due process as prescribed by the US Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>The Police State</strong></p>
<p>The burgeoning police state currently being built in this country is the result of the Warfare State. Legislation that authorized such things as the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, the NDAA, the DHS, USNORTHCOM, etc., tramples the Bill of Rights into the ground. For all intents and purposes, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth amendments to the Constitution have been thoroughly and absolutely shredded by every administration and congress of the Twenty First century.</p>
<p>I absolutely refuse to vote for any candidate of any political party that would facilitate the burgeoning police state. That would be like asking me to vote for the lesser evil of, say, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, or like asking me to choose between Nero and Caligula. No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>The New World Order</strong></p>
<p>Now, use this term and all kinds of ideas pop into people’s minds. To some, it means a “Jewish conspiracy.” To others, it means a “Catholic conspiracy.” To still others it means a “Masonic conspiracy.” Ad infinitum.</p>
<p>However, to me it simply means there are elitists within government, business, religion, private groups, etc., (from virtually any and every brand or type) who truly desire to strip countries (especially the United States) of their independence and sovereignty. This is nothing new. Its roots go back to the Tower of Babel.</p>
<p>There have always been rich and powerful individuals who have attempted to accrue riches and power unto themselves. And the best way to accomplish this is to erase national borders. It is always about money. Always. Sovereign nations are an encumbrance to a global anything, but especially to a global financial market. Trade restrictions, imposts, tariffs, regulations, etc., are anathema to global merchants. Therefore, in order to erect a global economy or global financial market, one must create some sort of global government to control it. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the New World Order.</p>
<p>I believe the United Nations is a tool of globalists to pave the way for global government. I believe certain internationalist organizations were created to facilitate global government. Some of these organizations probably include the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, etc.</p>
<p>But from a political perspective, I refuse to vote for any candidate for public office, regardless of political party, that would support any legislation that would cede even the slightest bit of American sovereignty to any supranational or international body. Most of the so-called “free trade” deals fall into this category. The creation of any facsimile of a European or North American Union or North American Community (call it what you will) falls into this category; asking US armed forces to serve under, or at the behest of, the United Nations falls into this category; and legislation that would facilitate illegal immigration certainly falls into this category.</p>
<p><strong>Gun Control</strong></p>
<p>This is a no compromise, no negotiation-issue with me. I absolutely will not vote for any candidate, regardless of political party, that supports any additional gun control. We already have too many egregiously enslavish gun control laws on the books. If anything, our lawmakers should be expunging gun control laws, not adding new ones.</p>
<p>Friends, have you ever noticed the wording of the Second Amendment carefully? The Second Amendment is the only part of the Constitution that is said to be “necessary.” The only thing, the ONLY thing, that the Constitution says is “necessary” is the right of the people to keep and bear arms. It doesn’t say that the Supreme Court is necessary, or that the US Congress is necessary, or that even the President is necessary. It says that the right of citizens to keep and bear arms is necessary. (A big word of thanks to my good friend, Dr. Ed Vieira, for recently pointing this out to me.)</p>
<p>I don’t care if a candidate for public office is a Democrat, Republican, or Whig, if he or she supports or facilitates in any way any further gun control, I absolutely and positively will not vote for them&#8211;regardless of how more “evil” their political opponent might be.</p>
<p>There you have it. These are the six criteria I use when I say I will not vote for the lesser of two evils. I don’t expect a candidate for public office to be perfect; I don’t expect to agree with them on every issue; I don’t expect them to be of my religious persuasion. I can differ with them on a wide array of issues. But these six issues are not negotiable. On these issues, there is no lesser of two evils. Transgression of any one of these issues means I will not vote for them&#8211;party affiliation notwithstanding. I concur with the words of John Quincy Adams, “Always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost.” And these are the six principles upon which I will either vote or not vote with the “sweetest reflection.”</p>
<p>Dear reader, I sincerely hope that you are not one of these folks who blindly support a political party with no regard to position or principle. A man or woman who has no principles they will not compromise has no principles at all. And if we need anything in the voting booth today, it is fidelity to principle&#8211;especially the principles of liberty upon which our freedoms rest.</p>

			<p><em>This bankster run system does not work for you and I. After reading this article and you still have not taken your money out of their banks and you have not stopped shopping in globalist stores like Walmart and you are not planning to trade and barter with your neighbors as well as grow your own food, then you get the dismal future you deserve. If you stay in the banksters system and continue to participate in this rigged game stemming from Wall Street, you are sowing the seeds of your own destruction!</em></p>
<h4>There Is a New Elephant in the Room</h4>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/escape-wall-street.jpg" width="300" height="200" />There are a series of new free trade agreements which threaten to obliterate the cities of the United States in the same manner we have witnessed in Detroit. Among the worst of these new free trade agreements is the one entitled “<a href="http://thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/08/14/escape-from-wall-street/entitled%20%22Increasing%20American%20Jobs%20Through%20Greater%20Exports%20to%20Africa%20Act%20of%202013%20(H.R.%201777).%22" target="_blank">Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013</a> (H.R. 1777).”</p>
<p>The premise of this article is based upon the fact that Detroit was primarily destroyed by the anti-worker free trade agreements of NAFTA and CAFTA.</p>
<p>If the complete destruction of one American city was not enough, through NAFTA and CAFTA, we should all be concerned that Congress is preparing to pass H.R. 1777. H.R. 1777 is not just another free trade agreement, but this is far worse than NAFTA and CAFTA in that this bill takes American taxpayer money and funds industrial infrastructure in many of the 54 African countries in order to make them “factory ready.” America, you are soon going to be forced to fund your own economic demise. Not only will you likely lose your job, witness your city going broke, but you will go deeper into debt paying the taxes that Congress will require to fund the African Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Before discussing the impact of <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1777/text" target="_blank">H.R. 1777</a> on America as a whole, we can get a strong sense of what it is going to be like when this bill passes by quickly examining the impact of NAFTA and CAFTA on Detroit.</p>
<h4>NAFTA, CAFTA and the Destruction of the Motor City</h4>
<p>At the height of Detroit’s success as a city. the city was a representation of the American middle class dominance. It was greatest manufacturing city ever seen on the planet. Detroit once made cars that were the envy of the world.</p>
<p>At its peak, Detroit was the America’s fourth-largest city, with more than 1.8 million people. Detroit’s population losses began in the 1960s with migration to the suburbs. Then in the 1990′s Detroit fell victim to global politics in the names of NAFTA and CAFTA and literally, the roof caved in.<b></b></p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/detroit-2.jpg" width="276" height="183" />Today, 30% of Detroit’s 140 square miles are either <a href="http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/87054002.html" target="_blank">vacant or deserted</a>. Detroit used to be the fourth-largest city in the US, with a population of nearly 2 million people. Today, Detroit has less than 700,000 residents. There are more than 33,500 <a href="http://spectregroup.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/downtown-rural-detroit/" target="_blank">vacant houses</a>and over 90,000 vacant lots in Detroit. The city government is <a href="http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/87054002.html" target="_blank">razing</a> entire city blocks of business buildings and residential homes. If you are the only one left on your block, you are forced to move and if you are lucky you will receive $10,000 for your home.</p>
<p>Under NAFTA and CAFTA, virtually all tariffs were eliminated so that manufacturers could shut down U.S. plants and relocate to the third world in order that they could pay their new, foreign workers slave labor wages. Then, adding insult to injury, when NAFTA and CAFTA eliminated tariffs, they made it possible for the multinational corporations to ship these foreign made products back into the U.S. and pay no import taxes at all. Thus, the great city of Detroit was destroyed.</p>
<h4>The National Impact of the African Free Trade Agreement</h4>
<p>Soon after H.R. 1777 passes, every major city is going to look like Detroit. As bad as NAFTA and CAFTA are, at least the government did not take trillions of America dollars to build infrastructure in foreign labor markets. Yet, this is exactly what the African Free Trade Agreement is going to do.</p>
<p>I have to hand it to Congress for their undisguised boldness as they are not even hiding this private theft of public money. Additionally, Congress has the nerve to title this bill in such a way that it appears that American jobs are going to be created by passage of the bill. Sadly, most of the sheep will believe them.</p>
<p>How can I be sure that H.R. 1777 will be passed?</p>
<h4>A Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing</h4>
<p>In addition to H.R. 1777, SB 718 “Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013,” is being run through the Senate. The language for both bills is identical.</p>
<p>Additionally, the text of H.R. 1777 turns up in SB 431, the Nepal Trade Preferences Act, and SB 432, the Asia-South Pacific Trade Preferences Act. The language for all four bills is virtually identical.</p>
<p>Why do the banksters need all four bills with the same language? Simple, if one bill does not pass, the other three bills still have a chance.</p>
<p>For those who do not think that Congress doesn’t cater to the whims of Wall Street, explain why these bills contain provisions for global health, global education, global transportation and global water?</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it, there is an excellent chance that at least one of these bills will pass.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This bill is being perpetrated by the international banksters on Wall Street. Why do we continue to fund this criminal government, who in turns funds Wall Street? The solution resides in defunding the government which hands our money and our jobs over to the thugs on Wall Street. It makes no sense to continue funding our demise.</p>
<p>There are several options. First, there are countries which would be happy to accept skilled Americans because of the boost to their economy. Can you imagine if 100 million Americans suddenly left the country? Certainly, the government would eventually move to impose an iron curtain type of restriction on leaving the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should withdraw from the Wall Street system as much as possible. I can see the day where people cash out of their 401K’s (the government is preparing to steal them anyway), withdraw money from your bank account and invest with other like-minded people in a farm collective. Trading and bartering would be the new underground economy. By owning farms, urban refugees would be food sufficient, could become water sufficient with the proper planning and we could largely be out of the reach of the feds. However, there is one caveat. In a brilliant move, the Obama administration and the Supreme Court mandated participation in the Obamacare system. In my opinion, this was establishment’s way to keep people in their system. Obviously, defying the dictates of Obamacare would have to become our first line of civil disobedience.</p>
<p>There is a third option. The American people could defy the tyrannical laws to the point where the country erupts into a civil war. I prefer the second option because it comes the closest to nonviolent revolution. However, my instincts and knowledge of history tells me we are in for a very serious civil war. The flash point for what is coming will be gun confiscation.</p>
<p>Of course, the fourth option is to acquiesce. Presently, that is what well over half the country is presently doing. It is sad to think that so many will go quietly into the night without putting up a fight.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, all Americans have a choice on whether we are going to stop funding our destruction.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/croatiaee3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/croatiaee2.jpg" align="left" /></a>On July 1 Croatia became the 28<sup>th</sup> country to join the European Union, and on current form there will be no further enlargement for many years to come. A look at the glaring dysfunctions in Croatia’s accession, compared to the double standards Brussels imposes on Serbia and Ukraine, is indicative of the peculiar <em>mitteleuropäisch</em> view of what constitutes “Europe” which still dominates the political and media elite thinking in Berlin and Vienna.</p>
<p>After the disappointing experience with Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU in 2007 but continue to be plagued by unstable governments and all-pervasive corruption, many experts have expressed doubts about Croatia’s readiness for membership. On its entry a month ago it became the third-poorest nation in the EU, with unemployment hovering around 20 percent. Of those who work, one-third are employed in the public sector. If it joins the eurozone in three years, Croatia would also become a prime candidate for an eventual bailout.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/articles/2013/07/01/reportage-01">According to Transparency International</a>, Croatia is ranked below Rwanda, Namibia, Jordan or Cuba in its 1012 graft index. Former prime minister Ivo Sanader, who played a key role in negotiating the EU membership, was sentenced to ten years in jail last year for accepting multi-million bribes from foreign companies. Last March the European Commission expressed concern over Croatia’s low level of legal penalties in corruption cases and its effectiveness in battling human trafficking and organized crime. “Widespread political and economic corruption persist, and its courts often show an overly lax attitude toward due process,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/opinion/global/croatia-and-the-eu.html"><i>The New York Times</i> editorialist warned</a> on June 28. “The fact is that the Union may well be about to repeat the mistakes of the last round of accessions,” he warned, thus jeopardizing Croatia’s own future, diminishing membership prospects for other Balkan states, and stalling further enlargement for the next decade or more.</p>
<p>It is no secret in Brussels that Germany wanted Croatia in for its own geopolitical reasons, however, and that was the end of the debate. There is also an economic interest. Since their products have become significantly more competitive with the elimination of the 20 percent tariff on EU goods, German manufacturers and merchants in particular stand to profit from Croatia’s entry. They cherish the prospect of over four million potential new customers who are traditionally fond of German brands.</p>
<p>Many Croatians remain deeply skeptical about the benefits of joining the Union. In last year’s referendum on EU membership, only 43 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots and exactly two-thirds voted in favor of the union—a mere 28 percent of Croatia’s electorate. Recent polls show that only 39 percent welcomed the accession. State-funded celebration in Zagreb notwithstanding, Croatian accession was marked by all-pervasive gloom among its people as well as across the EU. Some Croats fear that tough competition from the north will drive many struggling companies out of business. Even Greece, Bulgaria and Romania are in better financial shape than Croatia, according to World Bank statistics.</p>
<p>For a country facing serious demographic decline, the most serious likely consequence of EU membership will be an exodus of educated young people when work restrictions expire in two years from now. Among Croatia’s under-25s unemployment rate exceeds 50 percent. A massive brain drain has already happened to Poland after it joined the EU in 2004, and to Bulgaria and Romania after 2007.</p>
<p>Croatian Euroskeptics say that just getting ready for EU entry has crippled their country in the same manner as Brussels’ neoliberal ideology has damaged the “Club Med.” Croatia cannot join the eurozone immediately, but it is maintaining a fixed euro-kuna exchange rate to qualify for membership in three years’ time. This denies it an opportunity to devalue and make its exports and tourist industry more competitive. On current form, Croatia’s tourist infrastructure can hardly compete with that of Italy, Spain, or Greece.</p>
<p>“Croatian governments have followed obediently the EU’s austerity advice, even before the accession.” Srecko Horvat and Igor Stiks wrote <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jul/01/croatia-latest-member-eu-periphery">in an op-ed for the Guardian</a>. The country’s foreign debt now exceeds $60 billion, more than $13,000 for each of Croatia’s 4.4 million people. It now has virtually no industry and relies heavily on tourism, which accounts for 20 percent of GNP. All this, Horvat and Stiks say, means that “Croatia has not actually joined only the EU; in reality, it has become a fully fledged member of the EU periphery.” One of the EU’s longest external land borders at 800 miles, they add, will necessarily cut Croatia off from its immediate and natural surroundings and bring further isolation from its neighbors.</p>
<p>By entering the EU Croatia has lost its membership in the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which now consists of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Serbia. The loss of customs privileges and trade benefits in those markets will cost the country at least 220 million dollars a year in lost exports, according to the Croatian Chamber of Commerce. Other analysts say that some 4,000 people will become unemployed as a result of Croatia losing CEFTA membership, with no compensating benefits in the highly competitive EU markets.</p>
<p>Last but not least, EU membership creates a major problem for thousands of Croats who make their living from fishing along the country’s Adriatic coast. They will face competition from much larger and better equipped fishing vessels from other EU countries—above all Italy—which are now free to operate in Croatian waters. In addition, they will have to invest heavily into new, EU-compliant trawl nets and safety equipment. Most of their gear is not in accordance with the EU’s Common Fishing Policy (CFP), whose regulations were modeled mostly on fishing in the Atlantic Ocean. Local fishers complain that successive Croatian governments did not even try to protect their interests and that they face bankruptcy.</p>
<p>For better or worse, Croatia is in the EU while other aspirants, like Serbia to the east, will stay out for many years to come—or, in the case of Ukraine, are not yet even in discussions for membership. Enlargement fatigue is all-pervasive among old and new Union members alike. The fact that it is particularly strong in Germany is what really matters. (Several smaller countries share the sentiment, notably Austria and Benelux.) German preferences largely explain the unequal treatment by Brussels of other countries in the former Yugoslavia and in Europe’s “eastern neighborhood.” What is sauce for the Croatian goose is no sauce for the Serbian or Ukrainian gander. Unlike in earlier rounds of accession, the EU no longer offers a specific timetable for achieving the promise of membership made at the summit in Thessaloniki ten years ago. Rather, the process remains <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-consequences-of-the-eu-s-enlargement-fatigue-by-john-o-brennan">open-ended and indeterminate</a>. EU Commissioner for Enlargement Štefan Füle claims that enlargement will continue, but officials in Brussels privately concede that this is not the case.</p>
<p>Last April Serbia had to sign a humiliating, EU-brokered deal with Kosovo’s secessionist government in order to obtain a “conditional” date for the opening of accession negotiations next January. Effectively giving up one-seventh of one’s sovereign territory for the sake of the elusive “Date” was both a crime and a mistake, but even that does not promise the government in Belgrade that it will be any closer to full EU membership a decade from now than it is today. Turkey has been a candidate since 1999, and yet it will never be allowed to join the EU. Skopje-Macedonia (FYROM) has had a candidate status for the past eight years, with the final goalpost nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>Even after Serbia’s capitulation last April, German lawmakers came up with a list of seven additional demands which Belgrade would need to complete in order to be given a date for the commencement of accession negotiations. They wanted the Serbian authorities “to find and prosecute the demonstrators who attacked the German embassy in Belgrade in February 2008” (a day after Berlin recognized Kosovo’s independence), which is well-nigh impossible because the German government has refused to give the Serbs any surveillance camera footage. More egregiously, the Bundestag demanded that the Serbs accept, and not deny, that “genocide” was committed in Srebrenica; to apply pressure on northern Kosovo Serbs to “actively cooperate” with EULEX and Kfor; and to display “visible readiness for legally binding normalization of relations” with Kosovo.</p>
<p>Brussels’ lack of straight dealing is equally glaring in the case of Ukraine, which is not even being offered the prospect of EU membership anytime soon. Kiev has been struggling since 2007 to obtain the more limited Association Agreement with the EU. At the 15th Ukraine-EU Summit in December 2011, the EU leaders and President Yanukovych announced that they had reached “a common understanding on the text of the Association Agreement,” and in March 2012 the chief negotiators of the European Union and Ukraine initialed the text of the Agreement. Stefan Füle announced at that time that the Agreement could be finally signed after the Ukrainian general election in October 2012. It did not happen. Additional demands and conditions keep emerging instead.</p>
<p>Topping the list is the case of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister, who is serving a seven-year jail sentence for corruption and is facing murder charges for the 1996 killing of a political opponent. Even though the case against the richest woman in Ukraine seems strong, Brussels has taken the position that it was politically motivated. The EU has also criticized Ukrainian authorities for failing to conduct last October’s parliamentary elections “in line with international democratic standards.”  With Germany again the lead skeptical voice on the EU side, the question of whether the Association Agreement will be signed at the Vilnius summit this November remains uncertain. If it is not signed, it will not be for lack of trying from the Ukrainian side.</p>
<p>Unequal treatment of different countries by the EU’s old core—and above all by Germany—reflects some old prejudices and cultural preferences which will not go away. Of course, no German politician will ever admit that his or her judgment is impacted by the fact that the Croats were German allies in both world wars, while the Serbs or Ukrainians were no</p>
