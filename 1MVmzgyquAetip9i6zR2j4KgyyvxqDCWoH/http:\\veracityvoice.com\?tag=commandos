<p>The erotic reliefs of Hindu temples with their gravity-defying and anatomy-challenging positions have found a new modern competitor in the Ukrainian crisis. Each party wants to get the Jews on their side, while claiming that the other side is anti-Jewish <strong>and</strong> a Jewish puppet at once. This impossible, Kama-Sutraesque position is the result of extremely confusing alliances: the Kiev regime lists devout Jews and fiery antisemites among its mainstays. The leading figures of the regime (including the president-elect) are of Jewish origin; strongman and chief financier Mr. Igor (Benya) Kolomoysky is a prominent Jewish public figure, the builder of many synagogues and a supporter of Israel. The most derring-do and pro-active force of the regime, the ultra-nationalists of the Svoboda party and the Right Sector, admire Hitler and his Ukrainian Quisling, Stepan Bandera, “liberators of Ukraine from the Judeo-Muscovite yoke”. Jews are ambivalent, and the sides are ambivalent about them, and a most entertaining intrigue has been hatched.</p>
<p>The Russians tried to pull Israel and American Jews to their side, with little success. President Putin condemned the antisemitism of the Svoboda party; he mentioned the desecration of the Odessa Jewish cemetery in his important talk. The Russians re-vitalised the World War Two narrative, fully identifying the Kiev regime with the Bandera gangs and the Nazi enemy. Still, this rhetoric is not taken seriously by Jews who refuse to feel threatened by cuddly Kolomoysky. “These Nazis are not against Jews, they are against Russians, so it is not a Jewish problem”, they say.</p>
<p>The Kiev regime mirrored the Russian attitude, if not Russia&#8217;s tactics. Being rather short of facts to brandish, they faked a leaflet from Donetsk rebels to local Jews calling upon them to register and pay a special poll tax “for the Jews support the Kiev regime”. This rude and improbable hoax was immediately and convincingly disproved, but not before it was used by, no less, Barak Obama and John Kerry. The American Jewish newspaper of record, The <a href="http://forward.com/articles/196864/the-real-truth-about-those-anti-semitic-flyers-in/">Forward</a>, obfuscated the issue by saying that Russians and Ukrainians are antisemites by birth and their denials are to be taken with a grain of salt. This mud-slinging was effective – the hoax has made the front pages, while its debunking was published on the back pages.</p>
<p>The Russians had the facts on their side, and the West knew that: the US <a href="http://www.jta.org/2013/06/27/news-opinion/world/ultranationalist-ukrainian-political-party-leaders-banned-from-u-s">refused entry</a> to Oleg Tyagnibok and other Svoboda leaders (now members of Kiev government) because of their antisemitism as recently as in 2013. But Russian appeals to Jewish and American sensitivities failed to make an impact. They know when to feign indignation and when to hush. Pro-Hitler commemorations are frequent in Estonia, Latvia, Croatia, and cause no lifting of a censorious brow, for these countries are solidly anti-Russian. In March of this year, the Obama administration’s special envoy on anti-Semitism, Ira Forman, <a href="http://www.jta.org/2014/03/13/news-opinion/world/u-s-envoy-ira-forman-russian-claims-on-anti-semitism-in-ukraine-baseless">flatly denied</a> everything and said to the <em>Forward</em> that Putin’s assertions of Svoboda’s antisemitism “were not credible”. The US wants to decide who is an antisemite and who is not; like Hermann Goering wanted to decide who is a Jew and who is not in the Luftwaffe. In the Ukrainian crisis, the Jews remain divided, and follow their countries’ preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Israel is neutral</strong></p>
<p>Recently Prime Minister Netanyahu called President Putin. Putin is always available for and always courteous to Netanyahu, as opposed to President Obama, who shows signs of irritation. (Admittedly Obama has to listen to Netanyahu much more often and for hours.) Netanyahu apologised that he wouldn’t be able to come to St Petersburg for Israeli Culture Week; instead, old reliable Shimon Peres, Israel&#8217;s President, will make the trip. He apologised for leaking the news of this visit cancellation to the media, as well.</p>
<p>This is quite typical for the Israeli PM: at first, he asks for an invitation, Russia extends it, then he cancels his visit and leaks it to the press, thus earning brownie points with the Americans. He did it at the Sochi Olympic games, and now again, in St Petersburg. This is his way of expressing Israeli neutrality.</p>
<p>Israel is explicitly neutral in the Ukrainian crisis. Israelis walked out and did not vote on the UN GA Crimea resolution at all, annoying its American sponsors. The Israelis had a flimsy excuse: their Foreign Office was on strike. The Americans weren’t satisfied with this explanation. Strike or not, vote you must!</p>
<p>We learned from our Israeli colleagues the details of the Putin-Netanyahu phone conversation, which elaborated the reasons for Israeli neutrality. Israel is worried that as an asymmetric response to the US sanctions, Russia would deliver its potent air defence systems to Iran and Syria. Iran and Russia had signed a weapons supply contract a few years ago, Iran duly paid; then the shipment was suspended. Iran went to court demanding a massive compensation for the breach of contract. Likewise, the Syrians were supposed to get the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, able to protect its skies from Israeli raids. The deliveries commenced; PM Netanyahu beseeched Putin to put it on hold. Initially Putin objected, stressing the defensive nature of the system. Netanyahu told the Russian president that the S-300 would allow the Syrians to cover the whole North of Israel, at least all the way to Haifa, rendering important airfields unusable and endangering civil aviation as well. Putin agreed to stop the deliveries.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin is friendly to Israel. He promised he would not allow the destruction of Israel; he promised to save its population if the situation should become truly dangerous. During the recent visit of PM Netanyahu to Moscow, Putin was not carried away by Netanyahu and Liberman’s hints of possible Israeli re-alliance with Moscow instead of Washington. He told the Israelis that their ties with the US are too strong for such a re-alliance being conceivable. Putin said that Russia is satisfied with the present level of friendship and does not demand that Tel Aviv weaken its ties with Washington. Putin visited Israel a few times, he received the Israeli PM in Kremlin. The Israeli ambassador Mme Golender sees Putin more often than do her American or French counterparts.</p>
<p>This friendly attitude has a down-to-earth reason: Putin is not fluent in English or French, while Mme Ambassador speaks Russian to him, eliminating the bothersome need of an interpreter. A deeper reason is Putin’s background: a scion of liberal elites, brought up in St Petersburg, schooled by ultra-liberal Mayor Sobchack, anointed by Boris Yeltsin, Putin is naturally friendly to Jews and to Israel. This friendly attitude annoyed some Russian ultra-patriots, who excitedly circulated his photo taken in the obligatory <em>kippah</em>near the Wailing Wall. They also counted and recounted the names of Jewish oligarchs in Moscow.</p>
<p>True, some of them – Berezovsky, Gusinsky, Hodorkovsky &#8211; had to flee their Russian homeland, but the Russian president is surely not the Jewish-tycoons-Nemesis and the-new-Hitler he is sometimes made out to be. Abramovich and Friedman, to name just two, retain his trust and access. Putin does not mind any oligarch (Jewish or Gentile) – as long as he stays out of politics.</p>
<p>Putin is also friendly with Jewish intellectuals and gentlemen-of-the-media, even if they are outright hostile to him. Masha Gessen, Jewish Lesbian Putin-hater and magazine editor; Alexey Venediktov, Jewish chief editor of <em>Echo Moskvy</em>, a popular liberal medium that attacks Putin every day; many others enjoy access to Putin, &#8211; while no Russian nationalist including Dr Alexander Dugin can boast of having met with the president privately.</p>
<p>Putin’s affability does not turn him into a bountiful source for every Jewish initiative. He stopped S-300 deliveries to Iran, but rejected all Israeli overtures asking him to ditch Iran, or Syria, or Hamas. In the course of their last phone conversation, Netanyahu claimed the Israelis discovered proofs of Iranian nukes. Putin politely expressed his doubts and re-addressed him to IAEA. He agreed to receive the Israeli “experts” with their proofs in Moscow, but nothing came of it. Russia’s support for Palestine is unwavering, – there is a Palestinian embassy in Moscow, too.</p>
<p>Putin supported building of a spacious Jewish museum in Moscow and personally contributed to its budget – but Russian street advertising proclaims the Resurrection of Christ, Eastertide, and His Nativity at Christmas. No “season&#8217;s greetings”, but open affirmation of Christianity. Russia is not like the US or EU, where external signs of Christian faith are forbidden, Easter and Christmas can’t be mentioned and whatever Jews request must be done immediately. Western Jews are annoyed (so their organisations claim) by public displays of Christian faith, but Russian Jews do not mind; moreover, they intermarry, convert and enter the Church in previously unheard of numbers. They are not strongly pro-Israeli, those that were already left for Israel.</p>
<p>So the Jews of Russia are not an influential factor to the Russian President. Putin will do what is right according to the Christian faith, and what is good for Russia, as he understands it &#8212; and he can’t be convinced to give up really important points. Other considerations – such as friendship with Israel – would normally take a much lower place in his priorities. However, in the midst of the Ukrainian crisis, as the Russians are worried by sanctions and by threats of isolation, they try to pull Jews to their side. This makes them increasingly susceptible to Israeli manipulation, whether state-authorised or a private venture.</p>
<p>Last week, Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld visited Moscow. In 2003, he famously threatened Europe with nuclear destruction (the “Samson Option”), saying “Israel has the capability to take the world down with us, and that will happen before Israel goes under”. Now he has explained to Russians Israel’s new policy: While the US enters the period of its decline, Israel must diversify and hedge its bets by drawing close to Moscow, Beijing and Delhi, he wrote in <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/571903">Izvestia</a> daily. Perhaps, but without going too far. A flirt – yes, switching sides – not yet.</p>
<p>Israel prefers to stick to its neutrality. This is easy, as the Israeli populace (excepting its Russians) is not interested in Russian/Ukrainian affairs, does not know the difference between Russia and the Ukraine and is rather unfriendly to Russians/Ukrainians. This goes for both the Left and Right; the Israeli Left is even more pro-American than the Israeli Right. As for Russian Israelis, they are equally divided between supporters of Russia and supporters of Kiev regime. While observing niceties towards Russia, Israel does not intend to side with Moscow. The Jewish oligarchs of Ukraine – Kolomoysky, Pinchuk, Rabinovich – are integrated within the Kiev regime, <strong>and</strong> they support Israeli right-wing on a large scale. Israeli businessmen are invested in the Ukraine, and the oligarchs are invested in Israel. Kolomoysky controls YuzhMash, the famed missile construction complex in Dnepropetrovsk, and holds the secrets of the Satan ballistic missile, the most powerful Russian strategic weapon. He allegedly intends to share these secrets with the Israelis. If Israel were to side with Moscow regarding Ukraine, the breach with Washington would be unavoidable, and Israel does not intend to provoke it.</p>
<p>Some marginal Israeli right-wingers support Russia; they claim that they represent Israeli public opinion and government. They try to collect on their promises before they deliver. However, this is not an ordinary scam: they are trying to turn Russia into a supporter of right-wing Zionism.</p>
<p>Consider Russian-Israeli far right activist Avigdor Eskin. He impossibly claims that the Israeli government has already decided to jump from the US train to join the Russian one, that Israeli commandos are on their way to fight for the Russians in Donetsk, that Israeli authorities intend to strip Mr Kolomoysky of his Israeli citizenship. Naturally, all that is a load of bunkum, but Russians swallow it hook, line and sinker.</p>
<p>Avigdor Eskin is a colourful personality: a convert to Jewish faith (his mother is not Jewish), an observant Jew, an ex-Kahanist who was arrested in Israel for an alleged attempt to desecrate Al Aqsa mosque and a Muslim cemetery, and who served two or three years in Israeli jail; he styles himself a “Rabbi” and wears a full beard. After serving his time in jail, he moved to Russia and built a network of Israel supporters among the Russian far right. His message is “Israel is a true friend of Russia, while Muslims are Russia’s enemies”. He also adds that Israeli settlers are anti-American and pro-Russian. (If you believe that, the tooth fairy is the next step.)</p>
<p>Recently he claimed that the Aliya Battalion of “experienced Israeli commandos and sharpshooters” came to warring Donbass to fight on the Russian side against the Kiev regime troops. The Aliya Battalion is a battalion in the sense Salvation Army is an army. This is an Israeli NGO, established by Russian Israelis of far-right Zionist persuasion and of some Russian military background. It is not a part of Israeli Army. For a short while, the NGO provided guards for Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, but the settlements stopped using them as they were extremely unreliable. They boasted of murdering Palestinian civilians, of torturing and killing children, but this was just a sick sadist and racist fantasy, people say. Afterwards, the Battalion leaders turned its name into a profitable scam, roaming American Jewish communities and collecting donations for their supposedly secret activities. As this scam was exposed by Israeli TV (RTVI network; it is available on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb1mFKApacE">YouTube</a>), they had disappeared from the public eye. Now Avigdor Eskin resurrected the old scam, and made a lot of headlines in the Russian media.</p>
<p>Eskin found a soulmate in prominent Russian media man Vladimir Solovyev. The Solovyev is of partly Jewish origin, lived abroad, then returned to Russia; he runs an important political show <em>Sunday Evening</em>on Russian TV. The Saker (a well-known blogger) <a href="http://vineyardsaker.blogspot.se/2014/06/media-rage-in-russia-how-long-can.html">described him</a> as follows: “This show is hosted by a famous personality, Vladimir Solovyev, who is a very interesting guy. Solovyev is a Jew, and he is not shy about reminding his audience about it, who was even elected as a member of the Russian Jewish Congress. He is also a Russian patriot, and he is an outspoken supporter of Putin and his policies. His position on the Ukraine is simple: he as a Jew and as a Russian has zero tolerance for Ukrainian nationalism, neo-Nazism or Banderism. He is a determined and total enemy of the new Kiev regime.”</p>
<p>It is possible Solovyev is going through some personal identity crisis: from celebrating his Russian roots, he moved to proclaiming his Jewish origin. Alternatively, it is possible (and more likely) that the Russian decision-makers want to pull Jews on their side, and Solovyev is acting with US Jews in mind. Stalin did it, so Putin could repeat the trick. In 1942, as Nazi onslaught threatened Russia, Stalin had sent some Russian Jews to the US, to speak Yiddish to Jewish communities and lobby for the USSR. The American Jewish community surely carries some clout… Now Solovyev and others are trying to influence Jews abroad; or at least to show to their superiors they are trying.</p>
<p>The price Eskin extracts for his fantasy stories is high. In Solovyev’s prime time programme, he called for the destruction of al Aqsa mosque and for the building of the Jewish temple on its place. He called Palestinians “the people of Antichrist”. Even in Israel such statements can’t be voiced on public TV. In confused Moscow, Eskin was feted and given a place in another important political programme, that of Arcady Mamontov. Who is conning whom: is Eskin conning his Russian hosts, or are his media hosts using him to con their superiors, or are their superiors trying to con the Russian people? Or is Israel hedging its bets? Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>Ukrainian Jews beg to differ</strong></p>
<p>Jews came to the Ukraine a thousand years ago, perhaps from Khazaria. This is not a homogeneous community; rather, they represent several communities. A lot of them emigrated to Israel; even more moved to Russia. They speak Russian and usually do not speak Ukrainian, though they picked up the vernacular over last twenty years. Normally, they wouldn’t care about Ukraine’s independence, as Jews  traditionally side with the strong, be it Poles under Polish rule, with Russians under Moscow rule, or with Germans under Vienna or Berlin. Now many of them have decided to side with the US or EU. One of the reasons why so many people of Jewish origin do well is that the ruling ethnic groups trust the Jews and rely upon their loyalty to the powerful and lack of compassion for their Gentile neighbours.</p>
<p>Another reason is the vague definitions. For last three or four generations, Jews have intermarried freely; children of these mixed marriages are often considered ‘Jews’. These are the ‘Jews’ to the present regime; often they have only one Jewish grandparent.</p>
<p>Ukraine, following its independence in 1991, moved into the Western sphere of influence, but Eastern Ukraine (Novorossia) retained its Russian character and links. Jews did well in both parts. Mr Kolomoysky is a prominent member of the Jewish community, and a mainstay of the Kiev regime.  He is a ruthless businessman, famous for his raiding of others’properties and for his Mafia connections. Rumours connect him with many killings of business adversaries.</p>
<p>On the other side, in Kharkov, the Mayor and the district Governor (nicknamed Dopah and Gepah) are Jewish, and they can be considered pro-Russian. It was thought that Kharkov would become the centre of rising Novorossia; president Yanukovich fled to Kharkov hoping to find allies and supporters. But Dopa and Gepa disabused him, so he continued his flight all the way to the Russian city of Rostov. Their decision to remain loyal to Kiev did not work well for them: one was shot, and the second one has been imprisoned and his attempt to run for president thwarted.</p>
<p>Kharkov is also home to Mr. Hodos, a wealthy and prominent Jew who fought most valiantly against Habad, the Jewish spiritual movement of which Mr Kolomoysky is a prominent member. The Jews of Novorossia apparently support the general pro-Russian trend, though there are exceptions. Practically all Ukrainian Jews have relatives in Russia, and had Russian education.</p>
<p>Israel has a strong network of agents in the Ukraine. They snatched a Palestinian engineer and flew him to an Israeli dungeon, and that could not be done without support of Ukrainian security services. However, the stories of Israeli soldiers fighting in Ukraine are somewhat exaggerated: these are individuals of dual citizenship who act at their own will, not a state representatives.</p>
<p><strong>US Jews are divided</strong></p>
<p>US Jews are divided on the Ukraine, as they were divided on Palestine. Friends of Palestine, people with a strong anti-imperialist record and sound knowledge of East European history &#8211; Noam Chomsky and Stephen F. Cohen &#8212; recognised and renounced the US attempt to sustain their hegemony by keeping brazen Russia down. A subset of people, Gilad Atzmon aptly called AZZ (anti-zionist zionists), Trots and other faux-Leftist shills for NATO like Louis Proyect – called for American intervention and brayed for Russian blood.</p>
<p>The notorious Israel Lobby is strictly anti-Russian. The State Dept. official Victoria (“Fuck EU”) Nuland personally directed the Kiev coup; she handpicked the government and the president of the new American colony on the Dnieper River. Her husband, Robert Kagan, is a founder of FPI, the successor of infamous PNAC, the extremist Zionist think tank which promoted wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and pushed for a war with Iran. Now they attack Russia, but they do not forget about their support for Israel.</p>
<p>Consider a young American gender activist and journalist, James Kirchick. He entered the Neocon network by shilling for the Lobby. He pink-washed Israel (“Israel as the best friend of gays on earth, while the Palestinians are homophobes who deserve to be bombed”). After doing the Israeli stint, he moved on to fighting Russia. He worked for the CIA-owned and US Congress-funded Radio Free Europe; stage-managed the sensational Liz Wahl’s on-air resignation from the RT and protested alleged mistreatment of gays in Russia. His dirty tricks were revealed by <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/how_cold_war-hungry_neocons_stage_managed_liz_wahls_resignation_20140319">Max Blumenthal</a>, a Jewish American journalist, a known anti-Zionist (working together with a Palestinian Rania Khalek).</p>
<p>While Israel is neutral re Ukraine, Israeli friends in EU and US are hostile to Russia and supportive of American hegemony, while friends of Palestine stand for Russia’s challenge to the Empire. The French Zionist media philosopher Bernard Henri Levy is an example of the former, while Michel Chossudovsky of Global Research is a representative of the latter. Leading critical (“anti-Zionist”) websites Counterpunch, Antiwar, Global Research sympathise with Russia, while pro-Israeli sites are hostile to Russia.</p>
<p>Zionists are nasty and vicious enemies, but they make even worse friends. Edward N. Luttwak is friendly to Russia; he called upon the US to make up with Russia. Strategic union of Russia and America is necessary, he says. Who cares about Ukraine? And here is his pitch line: Russia should fight China for the US benefit. Another Zionist friend, Tony Blair, also calls for peace with Russia – so Russia can fight the Muslim world for Israel. Quite similar to Eskin who offers his pathetic support to Russia in order to neutralise her positive influence and defence of Palestine.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Israel remains neutral for its own reasons. While Jews as individuals differ on Ukraine, there is a correlation with their stand on Palestine and on Syria. Enemies of Putin in Russia, Ukraine, Europe and US do support Israel and are hostile to Palestine, to Syria of Bashar, to Venezuela of Chavez. And the most dangerous lot are those who support Israel <strong>and</strong> Russia, as they are surely plotting some mischief.</p>

				<p>February 28, 2014 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20075#respond" title="Comment on Return To Seyeda (Lady) Zeinab—Now Secured And In Protective Hands"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="20075 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=20075">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><em>Seyeda Zeinab, Syria</em> - During a meeting at the Dama Rose hotel in Damascus the other morning, this observer was briefed by ‘Abu Modar,” a reputedly battle-honed field commander of the “Death Brigade,” a unit based in the northern Syria Eskanderoun region, north of Latakia. Abu Modar explained that he personally had chosen the rather peculiar name for his outfit to symbolize the willingness of its members to die for their cause—protecting Syria.</p>
<p><i>“Before each battle or each mission I ask my God to let me die defending Syria”</i>, he explained. “<i>If we are involved with a joint operation with Hezbollah, who are much admired because of their honesty and trustworthiness, I lead my men to the front line and ahead of Hezbollah troops out of respect for them and because we Syrians believe that as their grateful hosts we have this duty.”<br />
</i><br />
The gentleman began explaining the history of his militia, one of thousands (both pro-and anti-government) operating in Syria these troubled days. It is a history that included some of his predecessors fighting with the PLO in Beirut during the summer of 1982, but as he was relating all this, his phone rang. The conversation was not long. The caller, he informed this observer upon ringing off, was his “contact,” advising him that certain intelligence sources had received information overnight that an individual had been observed in the vicinity of Zeinab’s shrine placing a parcel of explosives into a vehicle, presumably with the intention to detonate it near her resting place. This riveted my attention, in part because this observer was scheduled by chance to join an army escort the next day and visit the historic site, located about 40 minutes south of Damascus. Nearly two months ago the government regained control of the area, but there are still some snipers around, I had been apprised by friends. Abu Modar’s specific mission was to take some of his commandos and kick in the door of the suspect’s house sometime during the night, arrest him, and turn him over to someone for interrogation. His mission struck me as simple enough and he was matter of fact in outlining his plan.</p>
<p>“We do this sort of mission often. This is part of our expertise, and we do it whenever we are asked by Resistance friends and Syrian authorities. It spares the army for their normal work on battlefields, and our unit is specialized, and from long experience we have acquired certain useful skills.”</p>
<p>I demurred when he invited me to join him, explaining I was a bit out of shape and did not want to get in the way of his men’s work or potentially hamper their operation. But he insisted, saying that I could stay in his jeep and just observe, and he doubted that I would be in any serious danger. I was tempted to accept his invitation, and agreed to his proposal to meet after lunch to finalize our plans for that night’s outing. At this point, however, I called a trusted and knowledgeable Syrian friend, who knows a lot about these matters, and she seemed exasperated I would even consider tagging along with the Death Brigade.</p>
<p><i>“Absolutely not Franklin! Khalas! (finish!) You are visiting Seyeda Zeinab bokra with the army and you are not going with anyone else!”</p>
<p></i>Frankly<i>,</i> I was a bit relieved by my friend’s unequivocal counsel, and my new pal from the “Death” militia (who is acquainted with her) sportively understood. An interesting anecdote was at this point related by my interpreter: that Abu Modor had laughed and claimed a badge of honor upon recently being shown YouTube videos regarding his macho, George-Patton-style exploits in Qusayr, and in villages around Qalamoun, and rebel claims that he and his brigade were “the number one pro-regime murderers in Syria.” I might also mention that the “Death” unit is part of the not-well-known-in-the-West <i>Popular Front for the Liberation of Iskanderun (PFLI),</i> currently fighting rebels north of Latakia, in the mountains bordering Turkey, and whose forces have also periodically spent time guarding the resting place of Zeinab.</p>
<p>The geographical place name “Seyeda Zeinab” can be confusing for an untutored foreigner, the reason being that it may refer to a group of five small cities in the governorate of Damascus—Al Zeyabeya, Hujayr, Husseiniya, Akraba and Babila—or, alternately, to the sacred burial place and shrine for Zeinab bint Ali, the daughter of Ali, the first Shia Imam, and his first wife Fatima. Zeinab was also the granddaughter of the Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and the sister of Husayn and Hassan. Her shrine and pilgrimage destination are located in the small town of Seyeda (Lady) Zeinab, but given its fame, the name also refers to a wider area. As a holy shrine and place of prayer and scholarship, one imagines this place to be in the category of perhaps Qoms in Iran, and Najaf in Iraq. All three attract thousands of pilgrims and tourists, and since the area surrounding Seyeda Zeinab was liberated and essentially pacified by the Syrian Army recently, visitors are again arriving daily from countries including Yemen, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan and Lebanon, among others.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Seyeda Zeinab, this observer’s gracious host, is Mohammad Barakat, a Sunni engineer from Homs, roughly in his early 50’s. His staff is of mixed religious backgrounds, and, as with most Syrian citizens I have met over the past three years, was essentially blind to and uninterested in sectarian differences in existence before the current crisis. All the mayor’s staff members are working long hours these days, responding to numerous requests for post-liberation help, appeals which they try their best to accommodate with their limited available resources. My three-hour discussion with Mayor Barakat was interrupted perhaps as many as a couple of dozen times by the appearance of an aid often seeking his signature or mayoral stamp on citizen petitions covering anything from requests for food stuffs, problems with housing, or attempts to find employment with a municipal project now getting started.</p>
<p>In his bee hive of an office, the mayor used a pointer to highlight locations on a large wall map hanging next to his desk, the map illustrating areas where repair and construction projects are being readied. Mr. Barakat enthusiastically proclaimed, “<i>2014 is the year we intend to start and finish area restoration work, and we take pride in the prospect that what we achieve here in Seyeda Zeinab can be a model for restoration work all over Syria</i> <i>that hopefully can begin soon</i>.”</p>

</div>
<p>Barakat and three of his staff members accompanied this observer on an informative and inspiring tour of the Mosque and Shrine of Saeyda Zeinab. The shrine, our hosts informed us, is an example of Shia architecture, and the dome is made of pure gold. The grave of Zeinab is enclosed within a raised, crypt-like structure centered directly beneath the massive golden dome. The doors of the shrine are apparently also made of pure gold, with mirror works on the roof and walls. The minarets and the entrance gate of the holy shrine are covered with Iranian moarrahg tile designed by the famous Iranian architect and tile artist Ali Panjehpour. My colleague from the mayor’s office allowed me to finger one and explained that each 4 x 4 inch tile, of which there were hundreds of thousands in the complex, cost more than $100 USD. There is also a large mosque adjoining the shrine which this observer was advised can accommodate more than 1,300 people and a further 150 in the attached courtyards. The two tall minarets, one of which was damaged by a rebel mortar, dominate the architecture of the mosque as well as a large souk on the other side of a newly-built security wall.</p>
<p>In the cavernous nave of the Seyeda Zeinab, just next to the beautifully inlaid, elevated crypt holding her remains, approximately 50 men were performing mid-day Salat al Duhr prayers. Some were in camouflage uniforms and appeared to be on military leave or from the security units guarding the inside and perimeter of Zeinab’s Shrine.</p>
<p>This observer did not want to awkwardly press his hosts for details regarding the identities of the armed men guarding Seyeda Zeinab or where they are from. Some Western media sources have speculated that Shia fighters from Iraq and Lebanon came to Syria to protect Seyeda Zeinab following the desecration in Iraq of the tomb of Hajar Bin Aday. Several sites on the Internet published reports claiming that a takfiri group exhumed the tomb of Bin Aday, who was one of the most prominent Muslim leaders at the time of the Prophet Muhammad and who was loyal to Imam Ali bin Abi Talib. Bin Aday’s remains were reportedly taken to an unknown location. This observer infers that Hezbollah is currently a prominent presence guarding Seyeda Zeinab, and my Syrian companion noted Lebanese accents in the guard station at the entrance.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the women’s area, several women were praying and others appeared to be part of the shrine’s Women’s Auxiliary, or Guild, as they directed visitors while graciously assisting and providing female visitors with black chadors upon entering the sanctuary. One charming middle age woman, who appeared to be Iranian, smiled knowingly at me, and with a twinkle in her eyes jokingly offered this visiting American a chador as “a gift and souvenir from our Holy Shrine and from our community—to take back to your country, in appreciation of you not bombing us…yet!” And she laughed at her own joke, as did all who heard it, including the mayor, some nearby soldiers, and teen-aged visiting students.</p>

<p><b>Update on the capture of the bad person sought by Abu Modar</p>
<p></b>Well, did Abu Modar and his “Death Brigade” get their man?</p>
<p>They did indeed, and it was the night before this observer’s arrival at Seyeda Zeinab. Abu Modar detailed to this observer and a few of his militia guys the evening’s events as we made plans to leave the next morning for the Iskandroun region and an interview the PFLI President, Ali Kyali. The capture, it seems, came about not by kicking in the alleged bad guy’s door, American SWAT team-style. Rather, the suspect was stealthily followed and, during the early morning of 2/25/14, apprehended at one of the Syrian army checkpoints that surround the village of Seyeda Zeinab.</p>
<p>Such incidents make it clear that Seyeda Zeinab is still a target of some jihadist types given its great importance to Syria, the region, and among Muslims globally. Yet across sectarian divides here there are growing signs of the great majority of the exhausted populations being ready, to a degree, to forgive and forget at least some of the events of the past nearly 36 months.</p>
<p>Visiting Seyeda Zeinab is a wonderful, solemn, exhilarating and inspiring ecumenical experience—one highly recommended to all tourists planning to come to the Syrian Arab Republic as improving security conditions begin to allow for the return of international visitors.</p>
<p>May the Sainted Martyr, Zeinab bint Ali, whose life was devoted to charity and to nursing others, and who is a model for all humanity of resistance and defiance against oppression and all forms of injustice, forever rest in peace.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/tomahawkmissile3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/tomahawkmissile2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>The &#8221;responsibility to protect&#8221; (R2P) doctrine invoked to legitimize the 2011 war on Libya has just transmogrified into &#8221;responsibility to attack&#8221; (R2A) Syria. Just because the Obama administration says so.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the White House said it had &#8221;very little doubt&#8221; that the Bashar al-Assad government used chemical weapons against its own citizens. On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry ramped it up to &#8221;undeniable&#8221; &#8211; and accused Assad of &#8221;moral obscenity&#8221;.</p>
<p>So when the US bombed Fallujah with white phosphorus in late 2004 it was just taking the moral high ground. And when the US helped Saddam Hussein to <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/25/secret_cia_files_prove_america_helped_saddam_as_he_gassed_iran">gas Iranians</a> in 1988 it was also taking the moral high ground.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has ruled that Assad allowed UN chemical weapons inspectors into Syria, and to celebrate their arrival unleashed a chemical weapons attack mostly against women and children only 15 kilometers away from the inspectors&#8217; hotel. If you don&#8217;t believe it, you subscribe to a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Evidence? Who cares about evidence? Assad&#8217;s offer of access for the inspectors came &#8221;too late&#8221;. Anyway, the UN team is only mandated to determine whether chemical weapons were deployed &#8211; but not by who, according to UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon&#8217;s spokesman.</p>
<p>As far as the Obama administration and UK Prime Minister David &#8221;of Arabia&#8221; Cameron are concerned &#8211; supported by a barrage of corporate media missiles &#8211; that&#8217;s irrelevant; Obama&#8217;s &#8221;red line&#8221; has been crossed by Assad, period. Washington and London are in no-holds-barred mode to dismiss any facts contradicting the decision. Newspeak &#8211; of the R2A kind &#8211; rules. If this all looks like Iraq 2.0 that&#8217;s because it is. Time to fix the facts around the policy &#8211; all over again. Time for weapons of mass deception &#8211; all over again.</p>
<p><b>The Saudi-Israeli axis of fun</b></p>
<p>The window of opportunity for war is now. Assad&#8217;s forces were winning from Qusayr to Homs; pounding &#8221;rebel&#8221; remnants out of the periphery of Damascus; deploying around Der&#8217;ah to counterpunch CIA-trained &#8221;rebels&#8221; with advanced weapons crossing the Syrian-Jordanian border; and organizing a push to expel &#8221;rebels&#8221; and jihadis from suburbs of Aleppo.</p>
<p>Now, Israel and Saudi Arabia are oh so excited because they are getting exactly what they dream just by good ol&#8217; Wag the Dog methods. Tel Aviv has even telegraphed how it wants it: this Monday, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper headlined with &#8221;On the Way to Attack&#8221; and even printed the ideal Order of Battle. (see photo)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/images/pepe270813.gif" align="left" /></p>
<p>Months ago, even AMAN, the Intelligence Directorate of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) concluded that Assad was not a fool to cross Obama&#8217;s chemical weapon &#8221;red line&#8221;. So they came up with the concept of &#8221;two entwined red lines&#8221;, the second line being the Syrian government &#8221;losing control of its chemical weapons depots and production sites&#8221;. AMAN then proposed different strategies to Washington, from a no-fly zone to actually seizing the weapons (implying a ground attack).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now back to the number one option &#8211; air strikes on the chemical weapons depots. As if the US &#8211; and Israel &#8211; had up-to-the-minute intelligence on exactly where they are.</p>
<p>The House of Saud had also telegraphed its wishes &#8211; after Prince Bandar bin Sultan, aka Bandar Bush, was appointed by King Abdullah as head of Saudi General Intelligence. Abdullah&#8217;s hard on is explained by his mother and two of his wives coming from an influential, ultra-conservative Sunni tribe in Syria. As for Bandar Bush, he has more longevity than Rambo or the Terminator; he&#8217;s back in the same role he played in the 1980s Afghan jihad, when he was the go-to guy helping the CIA to weaponize president president Ronald Reagan&#8217;s &#8221;freedom fighters&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jordan &#8211; a fiction of a country totally dependent on the Saudis &#8211; was easily manipulated into becoming a &#8221;secret&#8221; war operation center. And who&#8217;s in charge? No less than Bandar&#8217;s younger half-brother, and deputy national security adviser, Salman bin Sultan, also known as &#8221;mini-Bandar&#8221;. Talk about an Arab version of Dr Evil and Mini Me.</p>
<p>Still, there are more CIA assets than Saudis in the Jordanian front.</p>
<p>The importance of this report cannot be overstated enough. It was initially leaked to Lebanon&#8217;s Al-Safir newspaper. <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2013/08/saudi-russia-putin-bandar-meeting-syria-egypt.html">Here&#8217;s</a> Bandar&#8217;s whole strategy, unveiled in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, already reported by Asia Times Online. After trying &#8211; for four hours &#8211; to convince Putin to drop Syria, Bandar is adamant: &#8221;There is no escape from the military option.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Mix Kosovo with Libya and voila!</b></p>
<p>Former president Bill Clinton resurfaced with perfect timing to compare Obama&#8217;s options in Syria to Reagan&#8217;s jihad in Afghanistan. Bubba was right in terms of positioning Bandar&#8217;s role. But he must have inhaled something if he was thinking in terms of consequences &#8211; which include everything from the Taliban to that mythical entity, &#8221;al-Qaeda&#8221;. Well, at least al-Qaeda is already active in Syria; they don&#8217;t need to invent it.</p>
<p>As for that bunch of amateurs surrounding Obama &#8211; including R2P groupies such as Susan Rice and new Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, all of them liberal hawks &#8211; they are all suckers for Kosovo. Kosovo &#8211; with a Libya add-on &#8211; is being spun as the ideal model for Syria; R2P via (illegal) air strikes. Right on cue, the New York Times is already frantically parroting the idea.</p>
<p>Facts are, of course, absent from the narrative &#8211; including the blowing up of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade (a remix in Syria with the Russian embassy?) and getting to the brink of a war with Russia.</p>
<p>Syria has nothing to do with the Balkans. This is a civil war. Arguably the bulk of the Syrian urban population, not the country bumpkins, support Damascus &#8211; based on despicable &#8221;rebel&#8221; behavior in places they control; and the absolute majority wants a political solution, as in the now near-totally torpedoed Geneva II conference.</p>
<p>The Jordanian scheme &#8211; inundating southern Syria with heavily weaponized mercenaries &#8211; is a remix of what the CIA and the Saudis did to AfPak; and the only winner will be Jabhat al-Nusra jihadis. As for the Israeli solution for Obama &#8211; indiscriminate bombing of chemical weapons depots &#8211; it will certainly result in horrendous collateral damage, as in R2A killing even more civilians.</p>
<p>The prospects remain grim. Damn another coalition of the willing; Washington already has the British and French poodles in the bag, and full support &#8211; in air-con safety &#8211; from the democratic Gulf Cooperation Council petro-monarchies, minion Jordan and nuclear power Israel. This is what passes for &#8221;international community&#8221; in the newspeak age.</p>
<p>The Brits are already heavily spinning that no UN Security Council resolution is needed; who cares if we do Iraq 2.0? For the War Party, the fact that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey said Syrian &#8221;rebels&#8221; could not promote US interests seems to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Washington already has what it takes for the Holy Tomahawks to start flying; 384 of them are already positioned in the Eastern Mediterranean. B-1 bombers can be deployed from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. And bunker-busting bombs will certainly be part of the picture.</p>
<p>What happens next requires concentric crystal balls &#8211; from Tomahawks to a barrage of air strikes to Special Ops commandos on the ground to a sustained air campaign lasting months. In his long <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MID-01-270813.html">interview</a> to Izvestia, Assad gives the impression he thinks Obama is bluffing.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s certain is that Syria won&#8217;t be a &#8221;piece of cake&#8221; like Libya; even depleted on all fronts, Gaddafi resisted for eight long months after NATO started its humanitarian bombing. Syria has a weary but still strong army of 200,000; loads of Soviet and Russian weapons; very good antiaircraft systems; and full support from asymmetrical warfare experts Iran and Hezbollah. Not to mention Russia, which just needs to forward a few S-300 air defense batteries and relay solid intelligence.</p>
<p>So get used to how international relations work in the age of newspeak. General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi&#8217;s army in Egypt can kill hundreds of his own people who were protesting against a military coup. Washington couldn&#8217;t care less &#8211; as in the coup that is not a coup and the bloodbath that is not a bloodbath.</p>
<p>No one knows for sure what exactly happened in the chemical weapons saga near Damascus. But that&#8217;s the pretext for yet another American war &#8211; just a few days before a Group of 20 summit hosted by Putin in St Petersburg. Holy Tomahawk! R2A, here we go.</p>

<p>In 1964, the U.S. had for years been involved in covert operations in Vietnam designed to destabilize the North Vietnamese leadership and goad them into attacking American and South Vietnamese targets. On August 4th, U.S. naval authorities reported one of two recent “torpedo attacks” in the Gulf of Tonkin, torpedo attacks which were later admitted to be entirely faked in order to provide pretext for an open American invasion.</p>
<p>While Lyndon Johnson was declaring a “police action” in the region (essentially a war declared without the authority of Congress) CIA Station Chief Peer DeSilva was organizing Vietnam operations around a new strategy called “counter-terrorism”. This strategy held that terrorism, used in the hands of “the good-guys”, was not only acceptable, but necessary in order to undermine the support structures of the enemy. CIA counter-terror units were formed using mostly South Vietnamese nationals as well as men from surrounding countries. These hit teams, called Provincial Reconnaissance Units (PRU&#8217;s) were coordinated and led by U.S. special operations officers and CIA liaisons under the umbrella of ICEX &#8211; the Intelligence Coordination and Exploitation Program, meant to create perfect information sharing and centralization between various teams.  The entire horrifying edifice would eventually be called &#8220;The Phoenix Program&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discovery/31295-cia-americas-secret-warriors-the-phoenix-program-video.htm">http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discovery/31295-cia-americas-secret-warriors-the-phoenix-program-video.htm</a></p>
<p>The Phoenix Program is defended to this day by the CIA as nothing more than a practical counter-insurgency methodology meant to win the war faster, and with fewer casualties:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no2/a-retrospective-on-counterinsurgency-operations.html">https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol51no2/a-retrospective-on-counterinsurgency-operations.html</a></p>
<p>In fact, some in the mainstream still argue that Phoenix tactics should be used in Afghanistan and Iraq:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/opinion/04moyar.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=mark%20moyar&amp;st=cse">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/opinion/04moyar.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=mark%20moyar&amp;st=cse</a></p>
<p>But Phoenix went far beyond aspirations of “winning” in Vietnam. The program utilized a “by any means necessary” strategy to warfare that included the use of random assassination and the FABRICATION of enemy atrocities in order to rally the civilian population around U.S. forces. PRU operators routinely targeted the backwater villages of Vietnam, killing at least 20,000 civilians as later admitted by CIA Director William Colby, and 40,000 civilians as estimated by the South Vietnamese Government. The slaughter of villages was frequently blamed on the Vietcong, while PRU&#8217;s ran rampant in the jungles, physically mutilating victims in order to draw greater emotional reactions from Southern citizens as well as oblivious Americans back home.</p>
<p>All of this took place under the close supervision of the CIA. Torture was often applied in CIA substations with high tech security. CIA officers carefully selected PRU troops, specifically seeking out ARVN deserters, VC traitors, and South Vietnamese criminals looking for a reduction in their prison sentences. The CIA planned and mapped operations, including death squad operations. They created teams of monsters and unleashed them upon Vietnam, not just to win against the North, but to create the illusion that the U.S. military presence was justified.</p>
<p><strong>Skip ahead about 20 years&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The same exact theater was used in the 1980&#8242;s by the CIA in El Salvador. Militants and fascist political leaders, including El Salvadorian dictator-by-election-fraud Roberto D&#8217;Aubuission,trained at the Fort Benning, Georgia&#8217;s “School of the Americas” (also known as the School of the Assassins) where they learned the same “counter-terror” methods used during the Phoenix Program. This resulted in the formation of the Mano Blanco (the White Hand), a network of ruthless death squads utilized against Salvadorian citizens, killing tens of thousands in a bloodbath that was covertly endorsed by the U.S. government.</p>
<p><strong>Skip ahead another 30 years&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The techniques and technology have become more sophisticated, but the general strategy remains identical.</p>
<p>The Syria crisis is swiftly escalating with the advent of yet another unverified chemical weapons attack on the civilian population that is being used as a broad permit for the Obama Administration to enter into open operations against the Assad government. A previous chemical attack at the beginning of this summer was left unverified, though the establishment went to great lengths to convince the American public that the Assad government was responsible. It certainly didn&#8217;t help that the UN was relying purely on “samples” from a French evening newspaper called Le Monde rather than an officially sanctioned source, and that the UN was forced to acknowledge that the Syrian insurgents may have been involved.</p>
<p>Today, the mainstream media and the U.S. government references “strong indications that Syria’s government used chemical weapons in attacks that opposition groups claimed killed more than 1,100 people” as if their version of events is already considered concrete reality:</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324165204579026123332790830.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324165204579026123332790830.html</a></p>
<p>But where are these “strong indications”? Where is this unassailable evidence of Assad&#8217;s involvement? The American public hasn&#8217;t been given a scrap of verifiable data concerning the attack and its origin. Once again, we are being asked to accept on simple “faith” that our government is telling us the truth and that military intervention must be supported.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what we DO know for a fact&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The Syrian insurgency is made up primarily of Al Qaeda operatives (terrorists and criminals).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/11/syria-al-qaeda-connection/2075323/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/11/syria-al-qaeda-connection/2075323/</a></p>
<p>The CIA trained and supported these operatives using Bengahzi as a base for at least a year before the Bengahzi attacks.</p>
<p><a href="http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/01/exclusive-dozens-of-cia-operatives-on-the-ground-during-benghazi-attack/">http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/01/exclusive-dozens-of-cia-operatives-on-the-ground-during-benghazi-attack/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-cia-syria-20130621,0,6346686.story">http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-cia-syria-20130621,0,6346686.story</a></p>
<p>Syrian insurgents have been caught on numerous occasions committing startling crimes, including the torture and murder of civilians, and the mutilation of prisoners and even their corpses. Captured Syrian soldiers are commonly executed.</p>
<p>The U.S. government continues to support the insurgents despite their death squad mentality, supplying heavy weapons including anti-aircraft missiles.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>Syrian insurgents impose their own fanatical system of theological governance in regions where they have total control. Anyone remotely suspected of being an Assad supporter is tortured, and the civilian population is carefully vetted.</p>
<p><a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-19/world/37840878_1_al-nusra-deir-aleppo">http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-19/world/37840878_1_al-nusra-deir-aleppo</a></p>
<p>Clearly, Phoenix Program methods are being used by the CIA in Syria. The only difference in Syria is that the establishment has chosen to use the faction in rebellion as a tool for destabilization and war rather than a prevailing puppet government. Reports are now beginning to surface in the mainstream exposing direct U.S. and Israeli involvement on the ground in the Syrian theatre:<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>“<em>According to our information, the regime&#8217;s opponents, supervised by Jordanian, Israeli and American commandos moving towards Damascus since mid-August</em><em>.</em><em> This attack could explain the possible use of the Syrian president to chemical weapons.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>According to information obtained by Le Figaro</em><em> </em><em>, the first trained in guerrilla warfare by the Americans in Jordan Syrian troops reportedly entered into action since mid-August in southern Syria, in the region of Deraa. A first group of 300 men, probably supported by Israeli and Jordanian commandos, as well as men of the CIA, had crossed the border on August 17</em><em>.</em><em> A second would have joined the 19. According to military sources, the Americans, who do not want to put troops on the Syrian soil or arming rebels in part controlled by radical Islamists form quietly for several months in a training camp set up at the border Jordanian- Syrian fighters ASL, the Free Syrian Army, handpicked.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>According to this expert on the region, the idea proposed by Washington would be the possible establishment of a buffer zone from the south of Syria, or even a no-fly zone, which would cause opponents safely until the balance of power changes. This is the reason why the United States has deployed Patriot batteries and F16 in late June Jordan.”</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2013/08/22/01003-20130822ARTFIG00438-syrie-l-operation-anti-assad-a-commence.php">http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2013/08/22/01003-20130822ARTFIG00438-syrie-l-operation-anti-assad-a-commence.php</a></p>
<p>This report from Le Figaro has not yet been confirmed by a secondary source, but it fits perfectly with the Phoenix paradigm. The so called “rebels” have been trained by CIA operatives and U.S. interests. The rebels are armed and funded by the U.S. government. The rebels are vicious and amoral in their tactics, frequently targeting innocent civilians in death squad fashion. And finally, the rebels, it appears, are being directed on the ground by U.S. assets. The natural next step in this process would be a false flag, and what better way than to use chemical weapons against non-combatants; a “red line” which Barack Obama previously stated “cannot be crossed”?</p>
<p>As I have pointed out in numerous articles dealing with engineered disaster events, if you aren&#8217;t examining who benefits, you aren&#8217;t seeing the big picture.</p>
<p>Who REALLY benefits from the latest chemical weapons attack in Syria? Assad, already nearing victory against the insurgents, gains absolutely nothing from killing hundreds if not thousands of his own people with Sarin gas on the same exact day that a UN inspections team arrives in the country. However, the insurgents gain immense military support from the West if Assad is successfully labeled a war criminal. The establishment gains a pretext for air strikes, no-fly zones, and eventually a physical invasion of the region, which is something they have obviously wanted for quite some time given the fact that they have manipulated the Syrian revolution from its very inception.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all happened before, with different players, different faces, and different ideologies, but always the same winner – the global elites. Call it the “Phoenix Program”, call it the “School Of The Americas”, call it the “Arab Spring”; it doesn&#8217;t really matter. The endgame is predictable. Unilateral war without the approval of the American people or even Congress. Collapse of a nation or multiple nations resulting in the deaths of tens of thousand, hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions. Severe economic and social implications reverberating throughout the rest of the world. And American culture takes several steps closer to a totalitarian hell on Earth</p>
<p>I have been predicting the use of Syria as a catalyst for wider war for years:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/994-syria-and-iran-dominos-lead-to-world-war">http://www.alt-market.com/articles/994-syria-and-iran-dominos-lead-to-world-war</a></p>
<p>And in recent months, I reiterated my concerns and predictions, many of which are coming true as you read this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1535-the-terrible-future-of-the-syrian-war">http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1535-the-terrible-future-of-the-syrian-war</a></p>
<p>I do believe that the Obama Administration is going to steamroll forward with overt U.S. action in Syria, Iran, and likely Egypt. I do believe that the consequences economically and politically in America will be catastrophic. I believe that if extended U.S. or Israeli strikes occur in Syria, they will be accompanied by subsequent attacks here at home (false flag or otherwise). I believe that a Syrian strike should be considered a Red Alert event for those in the Liberty Movement preparing for the worst. We may not be able to stop the landslide of devastation that will be triggered in coming months, but we can still decide the outcome. Make yourselves ready now, and do not waver.</p>

			<p><strong>Why Washington and Tel Aviv Want Hezbollah to Keep Fighting in al-Qusayr&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><i>Homs Province, Syria&#8230;</i> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/syria-town-atareb-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/syria-town-atareb-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>During a tour of some of the neighborhoods in Homs, Syria’s third largest city after Aleppo and Damascus, with a pre-conflict population of approximately 800,000 (nearly half  Homs residents have fled over the past two years) located maybe about 22 miles NE of the current hot-spot of al-Qusayr, this observer engaged is a few interesting conversations.  More accurately labeled diatribes–with some long bearded Sunni fundamentalists who claimed they came from Jabhat al Nusra, aka Jabhat an-Nuṣrah li-Ahl ash-Shām, “Front of Defense for the People of Greater Syria”), and were preparing to return to al Qusayr to fight “the deniers of Allah”!</p>
<p>It is the strategic crossroads town of al-Qusayr, and its environs, which whoever controls, can block supplies and reinforcements to and from Damascus and locations north and east.  For those seeking the ouster of Syria’s government, including NATO countries led by Washington,  were their “allies”  to lose  control of al-Qusayr it would mean the cutting off of supplies from along the Lebanese border, from which most of the local opposition’s weapons flow and fighters have been smuggled over the past 26 months. If the Assad regime forces regain control of the city, Washington believes they will move north and conquer current opposition positions in Homs and Rastan, both areas being dependent on support from Lebanon and al-Qusayr. Some analysts are saying this morning, with perhaps a bit of hyperbole that as al-Qusayr goes so goes Syria and the National Lebanese Resistance, led by Hezbollah.</p>
<p>If government forces can retake the city it will  put an end to the  Saudi-Qatari green light, in exchange for controlling al-Qusayr, of the setting up a Salafist emirate in the area which would constitute a threat to the nearly two dozen Shia Lebanese inhabited villages of the Hermel region. If the Syrian army re-takes al-Qusayr, it would also avoid the likelihood of a full-fledged sectarian war on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>Meeting with a few self-proclaimed al Nusra Front militiaman last week, in Homs, one who spoke excellent British English they had plenty to say  to this observer about current events in al Qusayr to which they planned to return the next day to fight enemies “by all means Allah gives us”.  One added, when asked if they had confronted Hezbollah: “Of course but Hezbollah can’t defeat us. Eventually they will withdraw from Syria on orders from Tehran.  But first enshallah we will bleed Hezbollah with thousands of cut throats”, he boasted raucously as nearby kids  cheered and gave V for victory signs, smiles, giggles and cackling all around.</p>
<p>Such Jihadist rants are music to more than a few US congressional and White House ears these days, as once more in this region,  a major US-Israeli carefully calibrated regime change project,  appears to be falling short.</p>
<p>This week, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted overwhelmingly to arm elements of the Syrian opposition with a recommendation to “provide defense articles, defense services, and military training” directly to the opposition throughout Syria, who naturally, will “have been properly and fully vetted and share common values and interests with the United States”.  History teaches that the vetting part would not happen if the scheme is implemented, despite only a few in Congress objecting.</p>
<p>Perhaps lacking some of his father Ron Paul’s insights into US hegemonic plans for this region, Senator Rand Paul did object to the measure and he fumed at his colleagues: ”This is an important moment. You will be funding, today, the allies of al Qaeda. It’s an irony you cannot overcome.”</p>
<p>According to the Hill Rag weekly, veteran war-hawks Senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham, flashed a knowing smile but gave no rebuttal, perhaps realizing that Senator Paul is a bit untutored on the reality of current Obama Administration policy in Syria generally, and for al-Qusayr, in particular.</p>
<p>Contrary to the shock and anger expressed by Senator Paul, American policy in Syria is  to <i>de facto</i>  assist allies of al Qaeda including the US  “Terrorist-listed”  Al-<wbr></wbr>Nusra Front as well as anti-Iran, anti-Shia and anti-Hezbollah groups gathering near al-Qusayr. These groups currently include, but not limited to,   Ahl al-Athr Brigade, Ahrar al-Sham,  Basha’ir al-Nasr Brigades, Commandos Brigades, Fajr al-Islam Brigades, Independent Farouq Brigades, Khalid bin al-Waleed Brigade, Liwa al-Haq, Liwa al-Sadiq, Al-Nour Brigade, Al-Qusayr Brigade, Suqur al-Fatah, Al-Wadi Brigades, Al-Waleed Brigades and the 77<sup>th</sup> Brigade among the scores  of other Jihadist cells currently operating in, near, or rushing to, al-Qusayr.</p>
<p>Their victory according to US Senate sources would be a severe blow and  challenge to Iran’s rising influence in the region and Iran’s  leadership of the increasing regional and global resistance to the Zionist occupiers of Palestine in favor of the full right to return of every ethnically cleansed Palestinian refugee.</p>
<p>While Congress was considering what else to do to help the “rebels”, on 5/22/13,  no fewer than 11 so-called “World powers” foreign ministers, including Turkey and Jordan, met in Amman to condem,  with straight faces, even, tongues in cheek, the “flagrant intervention” in Syria by Hezbollah and Iranian fighters.”  They urged their immediate withdrawal from the war-torn country. In a joint statement, the “Friends of Syria” group called “for the immediate withdrawal of Hezbollah and Iranian fighters, and other regime allied foreign fighters from Syrian territory.”</p>
<p>Not one peep of course, about the Salafist-Jihadist-Takfuri fighters from more than 30 countries now ravaging Syria’s population. The truth of the matter is that the governments represented by their foreign ministers this week in Amman, will follow the US lead which means they will assist, despite some cautionary public words, virtually any ally of al-Qaeda whose fighting in Syria may be seen as weakening the Assad government and its supporters in Iran and Lebanon.</p>
<p>According to one long-term Congressional aide to a prominent Democratic Senator from the West Coast, while the Amman gathering described Hezbollah’s armed presence in Syria as “a threat to regional stability”, the White House could not be more pleased that Hezbollah is in al-Qusayr.”  When pressed via email for elaboration, the Middle East specialist offered the view that the White House agrees with Israel that al-Qusayr may become Hezbollah’s Dien Bein Phu and the Syrian conflict could well turn into Iran’s “Vietnam”. ..Quite a few folks around here (Capitol Hill) think al-Qusayr will remove Hezbollah from the list of current threats to Israel.  And the longer they keep themselves bogged down in quick-sand over there the better for Washington and Tel Aviv. Hopefully they will remain in al-Qusayr for a long hot summer and gut their ranks in South Lebanon via battle field attrition and Israel can make its move and administer a coup de grace.”</p>
<p>The staffer followed up with another email with only one short sentence and a smiley face:</p>
<p>“Of course the White House and its concrete wall-solid ally might be wrong!”</p>
<p>The dangers for Hezbollah are obvious – that it may be drawn ever deeper into a bottomless pit of conflict in Syria that could leave it severely depleted and prey to a hoped for death-blow from Israel.</p>
<p>Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and other party officials have dismissed that possibility.</p>
<p>The next few weeks may tell.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/NORTH-KOREA-STATE-OF-WAR3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/NORTH-KOREA-STATE-OF-WAR2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The United States and the two feuding Koreas could blunder into a real war unless both Pyongyang and Washington cease provoking one another.</p>
<p>Last week, two nuclear-capable US B-2 stealth bombers flew non-stop from America to South Korea, and then home. These ‘invisible’ aircraft can carry the GBU-43/B MOAB 13,600kg bomb that is said to be able to blast through 70 meters of reinforced concrete, putting North Korea’s underground nuclear facilities and its leadership’s command bunkers under dire threat.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, US B-52’s heavy bombers staged mock attack runs over South Korea – within minutes flying time of the North &#8211; rekindling memories of the massive US carpet bombing raids that devastated North Korea during the 1950’s Korean War. US-South Korean-Australian war games in March were designed to train for war with the North. The US media ignored these provocative exercises, but, as usual, North Korea went ballistic, foolishly threatening to attack the US with long-ranged missiles it does not yet possess. </p>
<p>We have grown jaded over the years by North Korea’s threats and chest-beating. But its recent successful nuclear test and work on a long-ranged missile have begun to add muscle to Pyongyang’s threats. No sooner was the new young North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in power than the US, South Korea and Japan began testing him.</p>
<p>More important, the US-South Korea defense treaty calls on Washington to militarily intervene if war erupts between North and South Korea. Given present tensions, a border fight on the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), commando raids by North Korea’s 110,000-man special forces, air or naval clashes could quickly lead to full war.</p>
<p>North Korea has repeatedly threatened to flatten parts of South Korea’s capitol, Seoul, using 11,000 heavy guns and rocket batteries hidden in caves along the DMZ. North Korean commandos and missile batteries are tasked with attacking all US airbases and command headquarters in South Korea. The 28,500 US troops based in South Korea will also be a primary target. </p>
<p>North Korea’s medium ranged missiles are aimed at US bases on mainland Japan, Okinawa and Guam. North Korea’s tough 1.1-million man army is poised to attack south. Massive US airpower would eventually blunt such an advance, but that would mean moving US warplanes from the Gulf and Afghanistan. The US Air Force’s stocks of bombs and missiles are perilously low and its equipment showing heavy wear and tear.</p>
<p>The US has become accustomed to waging war against small nations whose ‘threat’ has been wildly overblown: Grenada, Somalia, Iraq, Libya. The last real war fought by the US, against Vietnam, was an epic defeat for American arms. North Korea is not an Iraq or Libya.</p>
<p>North Korea’s air force and navy would be quickly destroyed by US and South Korean air power within days of war. But taking on North Korea’s hard as nails army will be a serious challenge if it fights on the defensive. Pentagon studies show that invading North Korea could cost the US up to 250,000 casualties. So the US would be clearly tempted to use tactical nuclear weapons. But North Korea vows to nuke Japan if the US goes nuclear. And there is the threat of Chinese intervention.</p>
<p>The US would be wise to back off from this confrontation and lower tensions with North Korea. America’s empty Treasury can’t afford yet another war, having already blown $2 trillion on the lost wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. America’s armed forces, bogged down in the Mideast and Afghanistan, are in no shape to fight a real war in Korea. Just moving heavy armor and guns there would take months. </p>
<p>Now might be a good time for Washington to ease rather than keep tightening sanctions on North Korea. Pyongyang’s real objectives are to gain a non-aggression treaty with the US and direct, normal relations. Washington won’t hear of this, though it deals with other repellant regimes. American neocons are determined to overthrow North Korea’s regime, fearing it will send advanced arms to Israel’s Mideast foes.</p>
<p>Military forces on the Korean Peninsula are on hair-trigger alert. Flying B-2’s near the North is almost daring it to attack. Diplomats, not air force generals, should be running this largely manufactured crisis. </p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/war-porn3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/war-porn2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The early 21st century is addicted to war porn, a prime spectator sport consumed by global couch and digital potatoes. War porn took the limelight on the evening of September 11, 2001, when the George W Bush administration launched the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; &#8211; which was interpreted by many of its practitioners as a subtle legitimization of United States state terror against, predominantly, Muslims.</p>
<p>This was also a war OF terror &#8211; as in a manifestation of state terror pitting urban high-tech might against basically rural, low-tech cunning. The US did not exercise this monopoly; Beijing practiced it in Xinjiang, its far west, and Russia practiced it in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Like porn, war porn cannot exist without being based on a lie &#8211; a crude representation. But unlike porn, war porn is the real thing; unlike crude, cheap snuff movies, people in war porn actually die &#8211; in droves.</p>
<p>The lie to finish all lies at the center of this representation was definitely established with the leak of the 2005 Downing Street memo, in which the head of the British MI6 confirmed that the Bush administration wanted to take out Iraq&#8217;s Saddam Hussein by linking Islamic terrorism with (non-existent) weapons of mass destruction (WMD). So, as the memo put it, &#8220;The intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, George &#8220;you&#8217;re either with us or against us&#8221; Bush did star in his own, larger-than-life snuff movie &#8211; that happened to double as the invasion and destruction of the eastern flank of the Arab nation.</p>
<p><strong>The New Guernica</strong></p>
<p>Iraq may indeed be seen as the Star Wars of war porn &#8211; an apotheosis of sequels. Take the (second) Fallujah offensive in late 2004. At the time I described it as the new Guernica. I also took the liberty of paraphrasing Jean-Paul Sartre, writing about the Algerian War; after Fallujah no two Americans shall meet without a corpse lying between them. To quote Coppola&#8217;s <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, there were bodies, bodies everywhere.</p>
<p>The Francisco Franco in Fallujah was Iyad Allawi, the US-installed interim premier. It was Allawi who &#8220;asked&#8221; the Pentagon to bomb Fallujah. In Guernica &#8211; as in Fallujah &#8211; there was no distinction between civilians and guerrillas: it was the rule of &#8220;<em>Viva la muerte</em>!&#8221;</p>
<p>United States Marine Corps commanders said on the record that Fallujah was the house of Satan. Franco denied the massacre in Guernica and blamed the local population &#8211; just as Allawi and the Pentagon denied any civilian deaths and insisted &#8220;insurgents&#8221; were guilty.</p>
<p>Fallujah was reduced to rubble, at least 200,000 residents became refugees, and thousands of civilians were killed, in order to &#8220;save it&#8221; (echoes of Vietnam). No one in Western corporate media had the guts to say that in fact Fallujah was the American Halabja.</p>
<p>Fifteen years before Fallujah, in Halabja, Washington was a very enthusiastic supplier of chemical weapons to Saddam, who used them to gas thousands of Kurds. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at the time said it was not Saddam; it was Khomeinist Iran. Yet Saddam did it, and did it deliberately, just like the US in Fallujah.</p>
<p>Fallujah doctors identified swollen and yellowish corpses without any injuries, as well as &#8220;melted bodies&#8221; &#8211; victims of napalm, the cocktail of polystyrene and jet fuel. Residents who managed to escape told of bombing by &#8220;poisonous gases&#8221; and &#8220;weird bombs that smoke like a mushroom cloud &#8230; and then small pieces fall from the air with long tails of smoke behind them. The pieces of these strange bombs explode into large fires that burn the skin even when you throw water over them.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what happens to people bombed with napalm or white phosphorus. The United Nations banned the bombing of civilians with napalm in 1980. The US is the only country in the world still using napalm.</p>
<p>Fallujah also provided a mini-snuff movie hit; the summary execution of a wounded, defenseless Iraqi man inside a mosque by a US Marine. The execution, caught on tape, and watched by millions on YouTube, graphically spelled out the &#8220;special&#8221; rules of engagement. US Marine commanders at the time were telling their soldiers to &#8220;shoot everything that moves and everything that doesn&#8217;t move&#8221;; to fire &#8220;two bullets in every body&#8221;; in case of seeing any military-aged men in the streets of Fallujah, to &#8220;drop &#8216;em&#8221;; and to spray every home with machine-gun and tank fire before entering them.</p>
<p>The rules of engagement in Iraq were codified in a 182-page field manual distributed to each and every soldier and issued in October 2004 by the Pentagon. This counter-insurgency manual stressed five rules; &#8220;protect the population; establish local political institutions; reinforce local governments; eliminate insurgent capabilities; and exploit information from local sources.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now back to reality. Fallujah&#8217;s population was not protected: it was bombed out of the city and turned into a mass of thousands of refugees. Political institutions were already in place: the Fallujah Shura was running the city. No local government can possibly run a pile of rubble to be recovered by seething citizens, not to mention be &#8220;reinforced&#8221;. &#8220;Insurgent capabilities&#8221; were not eliminated; the resistance dispersed around the 22 other cities out of control by the US occupation, and spread up north all the way to Mosul; and the Americans remained without intelligence &#8220;from local sources&#8221; because they antagonized every possible heart and mind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, most of the population was already immune to war porn. When the Abu Ghraib scandal broke out in the spring of 2004, I was driving through Texas, exploring Bushland. Virtually everybody I spoke to either attributed the humiliation of Iraqi prisoners to &#8220;a few bad apples&#8221;, or defended it on patriotic grounds (&#8220;we must teach a lesson to &#8220;terrorists&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>I Love A Man In Uniform</strong></p>
<p>In thesis, there is an approved mechanism in the 21st century to defend civilians from war porn. It&#8217;s the R2P &#8211; &#8220;responsibility to protect&#8221; doctrine. This was an idea floated already in 2001 &#8211; a few weeks after the war on terror was unleashed, in fact &#8211; by the Canadian government and a few foundations. The idea was that the concert of nations had a &#8220;moral duty&#8221; to deploy a humanitarian intervention in cases such as Halabja, not to mention the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in the mid-1970s or the genocide in Rwanda in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>In 2004, a panel at the UN codified the idea &#8211; crucially with the Security Council being able to authorize a &#8220;military intervention&#8221; only &#8220;as a last resort&#8221;. Then, in 2005, the UN General Assembly endorsed a resolution supporting R2P, and in 2006 the UN Security Council passed resolution 1674 about &#8220;the protection of civilians in armed conflict&#8221;; they should be protected against &#8220;genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now fast-forward to the end of 2008, early 2009, when Israel &#8211; using American fighter jets to raise hell &#8211; unleashed a large-scale attack on the civilian population of the Gaza strip.</p>
<p>Look at the official US reaction; &#8220;Israel has obviously decided to protect herself and her people,&#8221; said then-president Bush. The US Congress voted by a staggering 390-to-5 to recognize &#8220;Israel&#8217;s right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza&#8221;. The incoming Barack Obama administration was thunderously silent. Only future Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, &#8220;We support Israel&#8217;s right to self-defense.&#8221;</p>
<p>At least 1,300 civilians &#8211; including scores of women and children &#8211; were killed by state terror in Gaza. Nobody invoked R2P. Nobody pointed to Israel&#8217;s graphic failure in its &#8220;responsibility to protect&#8221; Palestinians. Nobody called for a &#8220;humanitarian intervention&#8221; targeting Israel.</p>
<p>The mere notion that a superpower &#8211; and other lesser powers &#8211; make their foreign policy decisions based on humanitarian grounds, such as protecting people under siege, is an absolute joke. So already at the time we learned how R2P was to be instrumentalized. It did not apply to the US in Iraq or Afghanistan. It did not apply to Israel in Palestine. It would eventually apply only to frame &#8220;rogue&#8221; rulers that are not &#8220;our bastards&#8221; &#8211; as in Muammar Gaddafi in Libya in 2011. &#8220;Humanitarian&#8221; intervention, yes; but only to get rid of &#8220;the bad guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the beauty of R2P was that it could be turned upside down anytime. Bush pleaded for the &#8220;liberation&#8221; of suffering Afghans &#8211; and especially <em>burqa</em>-clad Afghan women &#8211; from the &#8220;evil&#8221; Taliban, in fact configuring Afghanistan as a humanitarian intervention.</p>
<p>And when the bogus links between al-Qaeda and the non-existent WMDs were debunked, Washington began to justify the invasion, occupation and destruction of Iraq via &#8230; R2P; &#8220;responsibility to protect&#8221; Iraqis from Saddam, and then to protect Iraqis from themselves.</p>
<p><strong>The Killer Awoke Before Dawn</strong></p>
<p>The most recent installment in serial episodes of war porn is the Kandahar massacre, when, according to the official Pentagon version (or cover up) an American army sergeant, a sniper and Iraqi war veteran &#8211; a highly trained assassin &#8211; shot 17 Afghan civilians, including nine women and four children, in two villages two miles apart, and burned some of their bodies.</p>
<p>Like with Abu Ghraib, there was the usual torrent of denials from the Pentagon &#8211; as in &#8220;this is not us&#8221; or &#8220;we don&#8217;t do things these way&#8221;; not to mention a tsunami of stories in US corporate media humanizing the hero-turned-mass killer, as in &#8220;he&#8217;s such a good guy, a family man&#8221;. In contrast, not a single word about The Other &#8211; the Afghan victims. They are faceless; and nobody knows their names.</p>
<p>A &#8211; serious &#8211; Afghan enquiry established that some 20 soldiers may have been part of the massacre &#8211; as in My Lai in Vietnam; and that included the rape of two of the women. It does make sense. War porn is a lethal, group subculture &#8211; complete with targeted assassinations, revenge killings, desecration of bodies, harvesting of trophies (severed fingers or ears), burning of Korans and pissing on dead bodies. It&#8217;s essentially a collective sport.</p>
<p>US &#8220;kill teams&#8221; have deliberately executed random, innocent Afghan civilians, mostly teenagers, for sport, planted weapons on their bodies, and then posed with their corpses as trophies. Not by accident they had been operating out of a base in the same area of the Kandahar massacre.</p>
<p>And we should not forget former top US commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, who in April 10, 2010, admitted, bluntly, &#8220;We&#8217;ve shot an amazing number of people&#8221; who were <em>not</em> a threat to the US or Western civilization.</p>
<p>The Pentagon spins and sells in Afghanistan what it sold in Iraq (and even way back in Vietnam for that matter); the idea that this is a &#8220;population-centric counter-insurgency&#8221; &#8211; or COIN, to &#8220;win hearts and minds&#8221;, and part of a great nation building project.</p>
<p>This is a monumental lie. The Obama surge in Afghanistan &#8211; based on COIN &#8211; was a total failure. What replaced it was hardcore, covert, dark war, led by &#8220;kill teams&#8221; of Special Forces. That implies an inflation of air strikes and night raids. No to mention drone strikes, both in Afghanistan and in Pakistan&#8217;s tribal areas, whose favorite targets seem to be Pashtun wedding parties.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the CIA claims that since May 2010, ultra-smart drones have killed more than 600 &#8220;carefully selected&#8221; human targets &#8211; and, miraculously, not a single civilian.</p>
<p>Expect to see this war porn extravaganza celebrated in an orgy of upcoming, joint Pentagon-Hollywood blockbusters. In real life, this is spun by people such as John Nagl, who was on General David Petraeus&#8217; staff in Iraq and now runs the pro-Pentagon think-tank Center for New American Security.</p>
<p>The new stellar macho, macho men may be the commandos under the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). But this a Pentagon production, which has created, according to Nagl, an &#8220;industrial strength counter-terrorism killing machine&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reality, though, is much more prosaic. COIN techniques, applied by McChrystal, relied on only three components; 24-hour surveillance by drones; monitoring of mobile phones; and pinpointing the physical location of the phones from their signals.</p>
<p>This implies that anyone in an area under a drone watch using a cell phone was branded as a &#8220;terrorist&#8221;, or at least &#8220;terrorist sympathizer&#8221;. And then the focus of the night raids in Afghanistan shifted from &#8220;high value targets&#8221; &#8211; high-level and mid-level al-Qaeda and Taliban &#8211; to anyone who was branded as helping the Taliban.</p>
<p>In May 2009, before McChrystal arrived, US Special Forces were carrying 20 raids a month. By November, they were 90 a month. By the spring of 2010, they were 250 a month. When McChrystal was fired &#8211; because of a story in Rolling Stone (he was competing with Lady Gaga for the cover; Lady Gaga won) &#8211; and Obama replaced him with Petraeus in the summer of 2010, there were 600 a month. By April 2011, they were more than 1,000 a month.</p>
<p>So this is how it works. Don&#8217;t even think of using a cell phone in Kandahar and other Afghan provinces. Otherwise, the &#8220;eyes in the sky&#8221; are going to get you. At the very least you will be sent to jail, along with thousands of other civilians branded as &#8220;terrorist sympathizers&#8221;; and intelligence analysts will use your data to compile their &#8220;kill/capture list&#8221; and catch even more civilians in their net.</p>
<p>As for the civilian &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; of the night raids, they were always presented by the Pentagon as &#8220;terrorists&#8221;. Example; in a raid in Gardez on February 12, 2010, two men were killed; a local government prosecutor and an Afghan intelligence official, as well as three women (two of them pregnant). The killers told the US-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) command in Kabul that the two men were &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and the women had been found tied up and gagged. Then the actual target of the raid turned himself in for questioning a few days later, and was released without any charges.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the beginning. Targeted assassination &#8211; as practiced in Afghanistan &#8211; will be the Pentagon&#8217;s tactic of choice in all future US wars.</p>
<p><strong>Pass The Condom, Darling</strong></p>
<p>Libya was a major war porn atrocity exhibition &#8211; complete with a nifty Roman touch of the defeated &#8220;barbarian&#8221; chief sodomized in the streets and then executed, straight on YouTube.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is exactly what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a lightning visit to Tripoli, had announced less than 48 hours before the fact. Gaddafi should be &#8220;captured or killed&#8221;. When she watched it in the screen of her BlackBerry she could only react with the semantic earthquake &#8220;Wow!&#8221;</p>
<p>From the minute a UN resolution imposed a no-fly zone over Libya under the cover of R2P, it became a green card to regime change. Plan A was always to capture and kill Gaddafi &#8211; as in an Afghan-style targeted assassination. That was the Obama administration official policy. There was no plan B.</p>
<p>Obama said the death of Gaddafi meant, &#8220;the strength of American leadership across the world&#8221;. That was as &#8220;We got him&#8221; (echoes of Saddam captured by the Bush administration) as one could possibly expect.</p>
<p>With an extra bonus. Even though Washington paid no less than 80% of the operating costs of those dimwits at NATO (roughly $2 billion), it was still pocket money. Anyway, it was still awkward to say, &#8220;We did it&#8221;, because the White House always said this was not a war; it was a &#8220;kinetic&#8221; something. And they were not in charge.</p>
<p>Only the hopelessly naïve may have swallowed the propaganda of NATO&#8217;s &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; 40,000-plus bombing which devastated Libya&#8217;s infrastructure back to the Stone Age as a Shock and Awe in slow motion. This never had anything to do with R2P.</p>
<p>This was R2P as safe sex &#8211; and the &#8220;international community&#8221; was the condom. The &#8220;international community&#8221;, as everyone knows, is composed of Washington, a few washed-up NATO members, and the democratic Persian Gulf powerhouses of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), plus the House of Saud in the shade. The EU, which up to extra time was caressing the helm of Gaddafi&#8217;s gowns, took no time to fall over themselves in editorials about the 42-year reign of a &#8220;buffoon&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for the concept of international law, it was left lying in a drain as filthy as the one Gaddafi was holed up in. Saddam at least got a fake trial in a kangaroo court before meeting the executioner (he ended up on YouTube as well). Osama bin Laden was simply snuffed out, assassination-style, after a territorial invasion of Pakistan (no YouTube &#8211; so many don&#8217;t believe it). Gaddafi went one up, snuffed out with a mix of air war and assassination. They are The Three Graceful Scalps of War Porn.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Emotion </strong></p>
<p>Syria is yet another declination of war porn narrative. If you can&#8217;t R2P it, fake it.</p>
<p>And to think that all this was codified such a long time ago. Already in 1997, the US Army War College Quarterly was defining what they called &#8220;the future of warfare&#8221;. They framed it as &#8220;the conflict between information masters and information victims&#8221;.</p>
<p>They were sure &#8220;we are already masters of information warfare &#8230; Hollywood is &#8216;preparing the battlefield&#8217; &#8230; Information destroys traditional jobs and traditional cultures; it seduces, betrays, yet remains invulnerable … Our sophistication in handling it will enable us to outlast and outperform all hierarchical cultures &#8230; Societies that fear or otherwise cannot manage the flow of information simply will not be competitive. They might master the technological wherewithal to watch the videos, but we will be writing the scripts, producing them, and collecting the royalties. Our creativity is devastating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Post-everything information warfare has nothing to do with geopolitics. Just like the proverbial Hollywood product, it is to be &#8220;spawned&#8221; out of raw emotions; &#8220;hatred, jealousy, and greed &#8211; emotions, rather than strategy&#8221;.</p>
<p>In Syria this is exactly how Western corporate media has scripted the whole movie; the War College &#8220;information warfare&#8221; tactics in practice. The Syrian government never had much of a chance against those &#8220;writing the scripts, producing them, and collecting the royalties&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, the armed opposition, the so-called Free Syrian Army (a nasty cocktail of defectors, opportunists, jihadis and foreign mercenaries) brought Western journalists to Homs and then insisted to extract them, in extremely dangerous condition, and with people being killed, via Lebanon, rather than through the Red Crescent. They were nothing else than writing the script for a foreign-imposed &#8220;humanitarian corridor&#8221; to be opened to Homs. This was pure theater &#8211; or war porn packaged as a Hollywood drama.</p>
<p>The problem is Western public opinion is now hostage to this brand of information warfare. Forget about even the possibility of peaceful negotiations among adult parties. What&#8217;s left is a binary good guys versus bad guys plot, where the Big Bad Guy must be destroyed at all costs (and on top of it his wife is a snob bitch who loves shopping!)</p>
<p>Only the terminally naïve may believe that jihadis &#8211; including Libya&#8217;s NATO rebels &#8211; financed by the Gulf Counter-revolution Club, also know as Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are a bunch of democratic reformists burning with good intentions. Even Human Rights Watch was finally forced to acknowledge that these armed &#8220;activists&#8221; were responsible for &#8220;kidnapping, detention, and torture&#8221;, after receiving reports of &#8220;executions by armed opposition groups of security force members and civilians&#8221;.</p>
<p>What this (soft and hard) war porn narrative veils, in the end, is the real Syrian tragedy; the impossibility for the much-lauded &#8220;Syrian people&#8221; to get rid of all these crooks &#8211; the Assad system, the Muslim Brotherhood-controlled Syrian National Council, and the mercenary-infested Free Syrian Army.</p>
<p><strong>Listen To The Sound of Chaos </strong></p>
<p>This &#8211; very partial &#8211; catalogue of sorrows inevitably brings us to the current supreme war porn blockbuster &#8211; the Iran psychodrama.</p>
<p>2012 is the new 2002; Iran is the new Iraq; and whatever the highway, to evoke the neo-con motto, real men go to Tehran via Damascus, or real men go to Tehran non-stop.</p>
<p>Perhaps only underwater in the Arctic we would be able to escape the cacophonous cortege of American right-wingers &#8211; and their respective European poodles &#8211; salivating for blood and deploying the usual festival of fallacies like &#8220;Iran wants to wipe Israel off the map&#8221;, &#8220;diplomacy has run its course&#8221;, &#8220;the sanctions are too late&#8221;, or &#8220;Iran is within a year, six months, a week, a day, or a minute of assembling a bomb&#8221;. Of course these dogs of war would never bother to follow what the International Atomic Energy Agency is actually doing, not to mention the National Intelligence Estimates released by the 17 US intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Because they, to a great extent, are &#8220;writing the scripts, producing them, and collecting the royalties&#8221; in terms of corporate media, they can get away with an astonishingly toxic fusion of arrogance and ignorance &#8211; about the Middle East, about Persian culture, about Asian integration, about the nuclear issue, about the oil industry, about the global economy, about &#8220;the Rest&#8221; as compared to &#8220;the West&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just like with Iraq in 2002, Iran is always dehumanized. The relentless, totally hysterical, fear-inducing &#8220;narrative&#8221; of &#8220;should we bomb now or should we bomb later&#8221; is always about oh so very smart bunker buster bombs and precision missiles that will accomplish an ultra clean large-scale devastation job without producing a single &#8220;collateral damage&#8221;. Just like safe sex.</p>
<p>And even when the voice of the establishment itself &#8211; the New York Times &#8211; admits that neither US nor Israeli intelligence believe Iran has decided to build a bomb (a 5-year-old could reach the same conclusion), the hysteria remains inter-galactic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while it gets ready &#8211; &#8220;all options are on the table&#8221;, Obama himself keeps repeating &#8211; for yet another war in what it used to call &#8220;arc of instability&#8221;, the Pentagon also found time to repackage war porn. It took only a 60-second video now on YouTube, titled <em>Toward the Sound of Chaos</em>, released only a few days after the Kandahar massacre. Just look at its key target audience: the very large market of poor, unemployed and politically very naïve young Americans.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s listen to the mini-movie voice over: &#8220;Where chaos looms, the Few emerge. Marines move toward the sounds of tyranny, injustice and despair &#8211; with the courage and resolve to silence them. By ending conflict, instilling order and helping those who can&#8217;t help themselves, Marines face down the threats of our time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe, in this Orwellian universe, we should ask the dead Afghans urinated upon by US Marines, or the thousands of dead in Fallujah, to write a movie review. Well, dead men don&#8217;t write. Maybe we could think about the day NATO enforces a no-fly one over Saudi Arabia to protect the Shi&#8217;ites in the eastern province, while Pentagon drones launch a carpet of Hellfire missiles over those thousands of arrogant, medieval, corrupt House of Saud princes. No, it&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Over a decade after the beginning of the war on terror, this is what the world is coming to; a lazy, virtually worldwide audience, jaded, dazed and distracted from distraction by distraction, helplessly hooked on the shabby atrocity exhibition of war porn.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/harman-obama3.jpg"><img src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/harman-obama2.jpg" align="left" /></a>“Woodrow Wilson, the 28th American president, is looking down in horror at what the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (WWC) is doing in his name.”</p>
<p>I wrote that last year in two exposés: <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=The_Selling_of_the_Woodrow_Wilson_Center" target="_blank">“<em>The Selling of the WWC”</em></a><em>  and <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=An_Investigative_Report:_The_Woodrow_Wilson_Center_Desecrates_its_Namesake%E2%80%99s_Legacy_and_Violates_its_Congressional_Mandate" target="_blank">“The WWC Desecrates its Namesake’s Legacy</a></em>”.  They revealed that the Washington, DC-based Wilson Center is violating its Congressional mandate and is up to its neck in tainted corporate cash.</p>
<p>A leading Congressman, a Wilson family descendant, citizens’ groups, and many others agreed. One prominent journalist called the WWC <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/18/turkey-woodrow-wilson-award-opinions-columnists-claudia-rosett.html" target="_blank">“a global joke.”</a></p>
<p>Several months ago, this Congressionally-created, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson_International_Center_for_Scholars" target="_blank">multi-million dollar think tank</a>, funded partly by taxpayers, made another colossal blunder.  <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/staff/jane-harman" target="_blank">It hired</a> former eight-term Congresswoman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Harman" target="_blank">Jane Harman (D–CA)</a> to be its president, <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/0510/Lee_Hamilton_to_step_down_from_Woodrow_Wilson_center.html?showall" target="_blank">replacing</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_H._Hamilton" target="_blank">Lee Hamilton</a>, also a former Congressman.</p>
<p>Harman, like Hamilton, is not only part of the good-old-boy (and girl) network of which the WWC is so fond.   Among her other baggage, charges of illegal conduct in a <a href="http://politics.salon.com/2009/04/20/harman/" target="_blank">spy scandal</a> involving AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) have <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2009/04/21/harmanic-convergence/" target="_blank">shadowed Harman</a> for years.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at Harman and the Wilson Center to see why they’re the marriage from hell.</p>
<p><strong>Harman’s spy scandal</strong></p>
<p>Two top AIPAC officials, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_J._Rosen#The_indictment_of_Rosen_and_Weissman" target="_blank">Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman</a>, were indicted on spy charges in 2005 for passing classified documents to Israel.</p>
<p>Citing confidential sources,<em> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1549069,00.html" target="_blank">Time magazine</a>, </em>in 2006, and <em>Congressional Quarterly,</em> two years ago, reported that the Feds had wiretapped Cong. Jane Harman and a “suspected Israeli agent” <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/04/the_harman-aipac_story_a_timeline.php" target="_blank">agreeing to this deal</a>: Harman would persuade the Justice Department to reduce the charges against Rosen and Weissman; in exchange, AIPAC and its influential supporters would persuade then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to reappoint the unpopular Harman as top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>Harman apparently promised the “Israeli agent” to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/us/politics/21harman.html" target="_blank">&#8220;waddle into&#8221;</a>  the AIPAC scandal “if you think it’ll make a difference.”  Harman ended the exchange with <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2009/04/hbc-90004814" target="_blank">“this conversation doesn’t exist.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The Justice Department and CIA wanted to prosecute Harman.  <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2009/04/did-alberto-gonzales-blackmail-jane-harman" target="_blank">But Alberto Gonzales</a>, President Bush’s Attorney General, reportedly refused because – ironically &#8211; he “needed Jane” to support the government’s ongoing warrantless wiretapping program.</p>
<p>Shockingly, <a href="http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/wp/docs/dod/usfrnklin80205ind.pdf" target="_blank">charges</a> against Rosen and Weissman were <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2009/05/03/the-spies-who-got-away/" target="_blank">dropped</a>  in 2009 because a judge put constraints on Federal prosecutors.  Larry Franklin, the Defense Department official who passed the classified documents to the two AIPAC officials, wasn’t so lucky.   He pled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Franklin_espionage_scandal" target="_blank">guilty</a> three years earlier and went to prison.</p>
<p>Harman has long <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/04/jane-harman-denies-cq-report-she-was-caught-on-nsa-wiretap-lobbying-for-aipac-officials.html" target="_blank">denied</a> any wrongdoing.  She has never, however, given a full account of her conversations regarding Rosen and Weissman.  Full accounts, as we shall see, are not one of Harman’s virtues.</p>
<p><strong>Harman’s genocide flip-flop</strong></p>
<p>While co-sponsoring <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.Res.106:" target="_blank">Congressional resolution HR 106</a> on the <a href="http://www.armenian-genocide.org/" target="_blank">Armenian genocide</a>  committed by Turkey, Cong. Harman went <a href="http://asbarez.com/55952/la-times-editorial-condemns-harman-for-duplicity-on-genocide-resolution/" target="_blank">behind the backs</a> of her constituents in October of 2007 by asking then-Foreign Relations Chair Tom Lantos (D-CA) to bury the resolution.  Only after her constituents discovered this through other sources <a href="http://www.house.gov/list/hearing/ca36_harman/071012genocide.shtml" target="_blank">did she admit</a> to it. <em></em></p>
<p>But the explanations for her <a href="http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2007/10/harman-flip-flo.html" target="_blank">flip-flop made little sense</a>. “This is the wrong time” for the resolution, wrote Harman.  But she couldn’t cite anything relevant in 2007 that had changed regarding Turkey, Armenia, or the Middle East since she signed onto the resolution a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Harman claimed that a genocide resolution would “embarrass or isolate the Turkish leadership.” This claim came suspiciously soon after she met with Turkey’s threatening Prime Minister, Recep Erdogan. Apparently, recognizing a genocide requires an OK from the perpetrating country’s leader.</p>
<p>But Harman reached truly ridiculous heights by claiming– again, this was in 2007 – that it was “obvious” that Turkey’s “leadership” was needed for “resolving the Israel-Palestine issue.”  Turkey had never, of course, played a significant role in mediating between Israelis and Palestinians. What really caused Harman’s genocide flip-flop?</p>
<p><strong>Jewish groups and Turkey</strong></p>
<p>AIPAC was (and is) one of several major Jewish American organizations that have colluded with Turkey to, among other things, defeat Armenian genocide resolutions. Israel, Turkey, and Jewish groups formed their <a href="http://www.noplacefordenial.com/2007/08/press-kit-history-of-lobbying-against.html" target="_blank">ménage-à-trois</a> in the 1990’s.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/1697/" target="_blank">Yola Johnston</a>, Community Outreach Director for the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, has admitted that AIPAC, the American Jewish Committee, B’nai B’rith, her own organization, and “the Jewish lobby” have “quite actively supported Turkey in their efforts to prevent the so-called Armenian genocide resolution from passing.”</p>
<p>AIPAC, reported the <em><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jun/8/jewish-community-ends-support-turkey-capitol-hill/" target="_blank">Washington Times</a></em> last year, had “lit up the phones” against the genocide resolution when “the Turks” asked a “senior researcher” at AIPAC to do so.  That “senior researcher” and “architect of the Jewish community’s support for Turkey” was none other than AIPAC’s notorious Keith Weissman.   So the Harman-AIPAC-Weissman threesome was at the center of not only a spy scandal but also a genocide cover-up.</p>
<p>And there’s more. Yet another scandal may have induced Harman’s genocide duplicity.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Defamation League scandal</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Harman wrote her genocide flip-flop letter to Chairman Lantos just as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League" target="_blank">Anti-Defamation League (ADL)</a> was taking a beating in the <a href="http://npfdnews.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">U.S. and internationally</a> for denying the Armenian genocide and helping Turkey lobby against Armenian genocide recognition.  Human rights activists, principled Jews, and Armenian Americans had just months earlier launched a campaign (see <a href="http://www.noplacefordenial.com/">NoPlaceForDenial.com</a>) that was to result in more than a dozen Massachusetts cities’ <a href="http://www.noplacefordenial.com/2007/11/chronology-of-events.html" target="_blank">evicting</a> the ADL’s so-called “No Place for Hate” anti-bias program.</p>
<p>The Turkish government was furious that the embarrassing arrangement among it, Jewish groups, and Israel was being <a href="http://npfdnews.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">splashed across the headlines</a>.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Erdogan made a <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/peres-to-turks-our-stance-on-armenian-issue-hasn-t-changed-1.228194" target="_blank">frantic call</a> to Israeli President Peres, while Turkey’s foreign minister reportedly warned the Israeli ambassador that “our bilateral relations will<a href="http://npfdarchive.blogspot.com/2007/08/0824-tdn-turkey-looks-to-israel-to.html" target="_blank"> suffer</a>.”</p>
<p>Did Harman, who was certainly aware of this uproar, panic at the prospect of a further deterioration in the already strained relations between Israel and Turkey?  Did she ask Lantos to kill the genocide resolution because Turkey would blame Israel, AIPAC, the ADL, and even Harman herself if the resolution succeeded?</p>
<p>Considering the timing, Harman’s relationship to Israel and the genocide-denying AIPAC, and the illogical explanations for her flip-flop, it seems probable.  Though the House Committee narrowing passed the resolution, Harman had to be pleased that it did not make it any further.  Her appeasement of Turkey, however, proved to be in vain:</p>

<li>Erdogan has expelled the Israeli ambassador, cut defense ties with Tel Aviv, and <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700176676/Turkey-warns-of-more-sanctions-against-Israel.html" target="_blank">threatened</a> <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/erdogan-turkey-warships-will-escort-any-future-gaza-aid-flotilla-1.383300" target="_blank">military retaliation</a> unless Israeli apologizes and pays compensation for the flotilla killings.</li>
</ul>
<p>But when, like Harman, one has few firm principles and has fooled herself into believing that a country such as Turkey is a friend, she inevitably winds up with yogurt on her face.</p>
<p>No self-respecting institution would have considered hiring anyone with Harman’s background.   That may explain why the Wilson Center hired her.  It has little respect for its mission or the American people.</p>
<p align="left">The Wilson Center flouts Congress</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:United_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_82.djvu/1399">Woodrow Wilson Memorial Act of 1968</a> was crystal clear:  The WWC must commemorate Wilson’s “ideals and concerns” and memorialize “his accomplishments.” Yet it has ignored large swaths of the Wilson administration’s record on the Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), Turkey, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The WWC isn’t just thumbing its nose at Congress and taxpayers.  It has closed its eyes to a wealth of political knowledge about a region in which the U.S. has enormous interests.  The Caucasus, for example, is a major locus for producing and transporting <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=9907" target="_blank">oil and gas</a>.  It’s also ground-zero in the <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34618.pdf" target="_blank">new Cold War</a> between the U.S. and Russia, particularly since the <a href="http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/Silkroadpapers/0902Chicky.pdf" target="_blank">Russian-Georgian war</a> of 2008.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keghart.com/DWBush_Pawn" target="_blank">Donald Wilson Bush</a>, President of the Woodrow Wilson Legacy Foundation and a Wilson family descendant, has rightly accused the WWC of “violating [its] very own mission and purpose.”</p>
<p><strong>Wilson’s Record</strong></p>
<p>Wilson and the State Department’s record on the region from the WW 1 era is extensive.  Though the U.S. did not formally declare war against Turkey in WW1, Turkey was the main ally of Germany, America’s enemy.  <a href="http://www.armenian-genocide.org/wilson.html" target="_blank">Wilson condemned</a>, in the strongest terms, Turkey’s genocide of Armenians and was a <a href="http://www.anca.org/genocide/wilson.php" target="_blank">fervent advocate</a> of Armenian independence.   By the terms of the <a href="http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.236/current_category.49/affirmation_detail.html" target="_blank">Treaty of Sèvres</a> &#8211; a product of the Paris Peace Conference in 1920 &#8211; the U.S. formally delineated the borders of that part of Armenia and Kurdistan that now lies within Turkey’s eastern regions.  Turkey later reneged on the Treaty.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the clear stipulation of Congress, Wilson’s record has been <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=An_Investigative_Report:_The_Woodrow_Wilson_Center_Desecrates_its_Namesake%E2%80%99s_Legacy_and_Violates_its_Congressional_Mandate" target="_blank">almost totally ignored</a> by the WWC.  Indeed, three years ago, historian and legal scholar Ara Papian, a Canadian resident and former Armenian Ambassador to Canada, applied for a WWC Fellowship to do <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=The_Selling_of_the_Woodrow_Wilson_Center" target="_blank">ground-breaking research</a> on the U.S. archival record regarding Turkey and the Caucasus – a proposal the WWC should have jumped at.  Papian was rejected without explanation.  Ironically, several months ago Lee Hamilton told the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3djexco1vg" target="_blank">American Historical Association</a> that U.S. foreign policy officials need the views of “historians.”  Yet as WWC president, he all but ignored the history of Wilson’s Caucasus policies.</p>
<p><strong>Tainted corporate cash</strong></p>
<p>The WWC has been corrupted by its <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=The_Selling_of_the_Woodrow_Wilson_Center" target="_blank">gluttony</a> for corporate cash.  Case in point:  it acknowledged that money was the main reason it journeyed to Turkey in 2010 to honor a Turkish billionaire whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do%C4%9Fu%C5%9F_Holding" target="_blank">Dogus Holding conglomerate</a> is a WWC donor, and to give a much-criticized award to Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.</p>
<p>Cong. Gary Ackerman (D-NY), Chair of the House Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia,<a href="http://ackerman.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=186&amp;parentid=4&amp;sectiontree=4,186&amp;itemid=1029" target="_blank"> blasted</a> Lee Hamilton for honoring Davutoglu.  Ackerman cited Turkey’s military occupation of Cyprus, closure of the border with Armenia, and denial of the Armenian genocide.  Honoring Davutoglu was “absolutely inconsistent with the mission of the WWC and the ideals that animated President Wilson’s administration and foreign policy.”</p>
<p>The Wilson Center, added Donald Wilson Bush, had engaged in “Turkish diplomatic appeasement.”  It had “sacrificed its legitimacy as a ‘neutral forum for open, serious, and informed dialogue.’”</p>
<p>“Why,” asked <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/18/turkey-woodrow-wilson-award-opinions-columnists-claudia-rosett.html" target="_blank">Claudia Rosett</a>, “should Congress keep fueling this morally blank, misleading and venal exercise [the WWC] with millions of American tax dollars?”  Good question.</p>
<p>Part of why the WWC has all but ignored Wilson’s record on Turkey and the Caucasus is undoubtedly that many major donors (present and past members of its elite <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/wilson-alliances" target="_blank">“Wilson Alliance”</a>) have lobbied for, or been members of trade organizations that have lobbied for, Turkey and against the Armenian resolution.  <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=The_Selling_of_the_Woodrow_Wilson_Center" target="_blank">These include Alcoa, BAE Systems, Bechtel, Boeing, Bombardier, Chevron, Coca Cola, Exxon-Mobil and Honeywell.</a></p>
<p>In fact, Harman’s predecessor, Lee Hamilton, engaged in a clear conflict of interest during his tenure by <a href="http://www.baesystems.com/WorldwideLocations/UnitedStates/AboutBAESystemsUnitedStates/USBoardofDirectors/index.htm" target="_blank">sitting on the board</a> of BAE Systems, a defense giant which does lots of business with Turkey.  Last year a Federal judge slapped BAE’s parent corporation with a $400 million criminal fine for “deception, duplicity and knowing violations of law … <a href="http://compliancesearch.com/compliancex/news-and-current-events/bae-pleads-guilty-to-us-conspiracy-charge/" target="_blank">on an enormous scale.</a>”  Too bad the judge didn’t also look into the Wilson Center.</p>
<p>Hamilton also <a href="http://www.albrightstonebridge.com/team/lee-hamilton/" target="_blank">sat on the board</a> of the Albright Stonebridge Group, a “global strategy firm” headed by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>Hamilton’s WWC bio, incredibly, was dead silent about his corporate affiliations. This same Lee Hamilton co-chaired the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/about/bio_hamilton.htm" target="_blank">official National Commission</a> on the 9/11 attacks, whose report has been widely criticized as incomplete and biased.    Hamilton and Harman, you see, can be counted on not to rock the corporate establishment’s boat.</p>
<p>The WWC is rife with other questionable characters, including those with deep ties to Turkey, such as <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/wilson-center-board-chairman-welcomes-new-member-ignacio-e-sanchez" target="_blank">former board member</a> and present Wilson Council member <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/wilson-council" target="_blank">Ignacio Sanchez</a>, a lobbyist employed by DLA Piper, which is a <a href="http://www.fara.gov/docs/3712-Exhibit-AB-20070510-4.pdf" target="_blank">registered foreign agent</a> for Turkey.  And former <a href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/staff/marc-grossman-0" target="_blank">“Wilson Public Policy Scholar”</a> <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2010/05/09/the-brazen-turkish-lobby/" target="_blank">Marc Grossman</a>, ex-US ambassador to Turkey and DLA Piper bigwig.  “Coincidentally,” Sanchez and Grossman were both on the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=xprnw.20110208.DC44231&amp;show_article=1" target="_blank">WWC Search Committee</a> that hired Harman.</p>
<p><strong>Made for each other</strong></p>
<p>If ever there was a marriage made in hell, therefore, Jane Harman and the Wilson Center are it:<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The WWC receives millions in “donations” from the military-industrial complex, which influences the Center’s agenda and policies.  Similarly, Harman – a former Defense Department lawyer – has received large <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-03/news/cb-58346_1_susan-brooks" target="_blank">campaign contributions</a> from defense and <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/pacs.php?cycle=2010&amp;cid=N00006750&amp;sector=D&amp;seclong=Defense&amp;newMem=N" target="_blank">aerospace</a> firms’ Political Action Committees and <a href="http://influenceexplorer.com/politician/jane-harman/cadd08c0f4004c6590a74fc1caf6ba28" target="_blank">employees</a>, including those in El Segundo, a <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/voting_on_weapons_and_war_20110308/" target="_blank">key military–industrial center</a> located in her former Congressional district.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Coincidentally,” major Wilson Center donors <a href="http://www.manta.com/c/mm88mtw/bae-systems-inc" target="_blank">BAE Systems</a> (Lee Hamilton’s comrade-in-arms), <a href="http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/" target="_blank">Boeing</a>, and <a href="http://www.chevron.com/products/sitelets/elsegundo/faq/" target="_blank">Chevron</a> have offices in El Segundo.  Indeed, BAE, Boeing, and Chevron were her “constituents” (and <a href="http://www.the-atc.org/data/memberslist/ghorn.htm" target="_blank">American Turkish Council members</a>) not only when she was in Congress. Those corporations – another “coincidence” – are her “constituents” again, at the WWC.  Might the WWC have hired Harman for her expertise in raking in military-industrial “donations”?</p>
<ul>
<li>The WWC has ingratiated itself with Turkey.  It has given awards to its Foreign Minister and a major Turkish corporate donor, and virtually ignored Wilson’s policies regarding Turkey and the Caucasus.   Harman, too, has ingratiated herself with Turkey.  She reversed her stance on the Congress’s Armenian genocide resolution (and gave absurd reasons for doing so).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And just as the Wilson Center has gotten away (so far, anyway) with violating its Congressional mandate, Jane Harman has escaped prosecution (so far, anyway) for her dealings with a “foreign agent” in the AIPAC espionage scandal.</li>
</ul>
<p>No, there’s no prospect that Harman will lead the WWC to adhere to the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Act of 1968, fulfill its pledge to be a “neutral forum for open, serious, and informed dialogue,” and release the grip that mega-corporations have on it.</p>
<p>If Congress of its own volition will not bring the Wilson Center to its senses, then Congress must be pushed by the American people to do so.  Other possibilities are investigations and legal action by third parties.</p>
<p>Just don’t count on Jane Harman’s cooperation.</p>

			<p><img id="il_fi" src="http://blog.balder.org/billeder-blog/Book-Cover-Rabbi-Yitzhak-Shapiro-Killing-Gentiles-240.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="357" />Israeli Police is now arresting leading Rabbis for endorsing and supporting <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/the-king-s-torah-a-rabbinic-text-or-a-call-to-terror-1.261930">&#8216;Torat Hamelech&#8217;</a> (The King&#8217;s Torah), the Jewish religious book that justifies the killing of Gentiles.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yaakov Yosef, son of Shas spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef, was questioned Sunday morning on suspicion of incitement to racism and violence following his endorsement of the religious tract which preaches Goy hatred.</p>
<p>Kiryat Harav&#8217;s Chief Rabbi Dov Lior was also detained a few days ago for his endorsement of the same racist text.</p>
<p>The arrest of the Rabbis  sparked violent protest across Israel. It also raised harsh criticism against the police and state prosecution by right-wing elements.</p>
<p>I guess that one may be puzzled by the whole saga and wonder how come the Jewish State, a state that legally discriminates people on racial grounds, a state that institutionally abuses its non-Jewish population, an entity that terrorises and starves the indigenous people of the land and often enough kills them <em>en masse</em>, is so concerned with a few Rabbis who endorse the Halacha interpretations that actually justify such lethal barbarian policies and practices.</p>
<p>The answer is pretty interesting. Zionism was initially an attempt to erect a Jewish civil society- a Jewish homeland where Jews could be subject to newly formed Jewish civil law instead of religious law.  As much as this idea appealed to some assimilated Jews at the time and a few new Israelis later, Rabbinical Judaism has never approved of the revolutionary innovative move. In fact, Rabbinical Judaism defies the notion of Jewish civil law.  For Israeli Rabbis, it is clear beyond doubt that if Israel defines itself as the Jewish state, it better be driven legally and spiritually by Halacha Laws.</p>
<p>The current debate in Israel is not new. It is as old as the Jewish State, yet there is an intellectually intriguing element in that ideological battle. Following the last Rabbi arrest, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, issued a statement backing the law-enforcement system. However, Netanyahu is not exactly a leading humanist dove. It is his government that keeps Gaza in a brutal siege and other Palestinians in open air prisons. It was his Government which unleashed Israeli Commandos to commit their deadly crime against the human aid flotilla in high seas last year. Netanyahu’s hands are soaking with the blood of innocent Goyim. On the face of it, there is an apparent continuum between the Halacha anti Gentile teaching and Israeli murderous policies and practices.</p>
<p>So here is the question, how come Netanyahu’s government arrests Rabbis who preach for lethal acts which Israeli Government happens to perform ? The answer may be devastatingly simple. Those Rabbis are arrested in Israel because they actually support the accusation that Goyim killing may be inherent to the Jewish Halacha law (or at least inherent to some interpretations of the Halacha). While Israel insists to present itself as a peace seeking nation arguing that the killing of Palestinians is no more than unfortunate incidents, by endorsing &#8216;Torat Hamelech&#8217; some Rabbis actually confirm that killing non- Jews is justified as far as Judaism is concerned.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the Jewish state seems to be pretty confused by the notion of Jewishness. As much as it yearns to celebrate an imaginary phantasmic notion of Jewish  heritage, it invests a lot of effort to conceal the real meaning of what Jewish heritage is in reality.</p>

				<p>July 2, 2011 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=11412#respond" title="Comment on Gaza Flotilla vs. Diaspora Jewery"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="11412 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=11412">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img id="il_fi" src="http://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/flotilla-cartoon.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="306" />The Israelis are preparing themselves for another massacre on the high seas.</p>
<p>This should not take us by surprise: after all, people who are <a href="http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/truth-history-and-integrity-by-gilad-atzmon.html">detached from a true notion of history</a>, and driven by a continuous fantasy of destruction, would be the last to draw a lesson from their past.</p>
<p>Earlier today I learned that The Israeli Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Ministry held a simulation practice, ahead of the Gaza flotilla: in the course of the exercise, Minister Yuly Edelstein formed a ‘special situation room’ that is designated to disseminate ‘public diplomacy’ on the internet ,via messages,  photos, video clips and additional materials, with emphasis on Diaspora  communities, Jewish organisations, and friends of Israel around  the world.</p>
<p>Just in case you weren’t sure what the expected role of Diaspora Jews is, I guess that by now Minister Edelstein has provided the answer.</p>
<p>However, the most interesting part of the story is the <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=52931">detailed description of the flotilla simulation itself</a>: the imaginary scenarios depicted by Minister Edelstein and the IDF provide a glimpse into Israeli collective psychosis.</p>
<p>“The exercise was based on a scenario in which approximately 500 activists on  approximately ten ships reached Israel&#8217;s territorial waters at 10:00,” <a href="http://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=52931">says the Israeli document</a>.  ”Despite having been warned by the IDF, the ships continued on their way. At  10:30, the Israel Navy began approaching the ships. Stun grenades were  thrown at the IDF soldiers, as well as one live grenade that caused a number  of casualties to our forces.”</p>
<p>But what are we to make of such an absurd supposition in Edelstein&#8217;s exercise, that the flotilla volunteers ( many of whom are women and elderly ) will be armed and dangerous, and intent of attacking the IDF?  We have seen repeated statements from the Flotilla organisers reassuring the Israelis that the Flotilla is a peaceful  humanitarian mission that has no combative intentions, and the  <a href="http://www.freegaza.org/en/home/56-news/1315-audacity-invites-media-to-inspect-boat">media have been invited to visit the boats</a> to verify the innocent nature of the Gaza bound cargo.</p>
<p>What is it then? Why are these Israelis  preparing for a war? The answer is clear and simple: as I have explored in the past, Jewish identity politics is shaped by a totally unique psychological disorder. I call it <a href="http://peacepalestine.blogspot.com/2006/09/gilad-atzmon-pre-traumatic-stress.html">Pre Traumatic Stress Syndrome</a> (as opposed to Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome). Jewish reality is shaped by an imaginary fictional future threat. To repeat the 19<sup>Th</sup> century Yiddish joke. <em>“A Jewish telegram: get worried, details to follow.”</em> Yet, the lack of capacity to differentiate between reality and imagination leads to the inevitable emergence of the most tragic possible scenarios. Time after time, the Israeli collective  easily buys into any given tragic fictional and imaginary treat, and would approve any &#8216;counter&#8217; measures.</p>
<p>The end result is known to us all: an endless  chain of colossal Israeli war crimes, that are committed in the name of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The Israeli simulation scenario continues, with an inevitable body count: “At 11:00, the order was given for IDF units to  physically seize control of the ships on which there was resistance. Our  forces were attacked with live – and other – weapons and were obliged to  neutralise the assailants. The results, by 11:45, were ten IDF soldiers  wounded (one critically, four severely and the rest lightly). Among the  flotilla participants, there were two dead and 14 wounded, including two  severely.”</p>
<p>Brilliant isn’t it? The peace activists (most of whom, remember, are  women and  elderly) ‘opened fire,’ seeking a battle with the best and most lethal Israeli commando unit. How realistic is that ?</p>
<p>Then, as the imagined scenario unfolds, a fierce battle develops, in which just fourteen activists are wounded, and  only one dies. At this point, for those who fail to remember what really happened last time around, here is video footage of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi6c10ntFZk">Israeli commandos  executing peace activists</a> on the Mavi Marmara.</p>
<p>But Minister Edelstein is far from being worried: after all, the Israelis have friends around the world.  “As the events were taking place,” the scenario continues,  “the media – with emphasis on the Internet,  Facebook and Twitter – were flooded with mendacious reports (by private  users, Hamas and others among Israel&#8217;s enemies). The situation room, in  coordination with the IDF Spokesperson and the National Information  Directorate, began to disseminate credible messages to Jewish communities  and friends of Israel around the world. Those in the situation room  responsible for new media began to update messages on the social networks,  Facebook and Twitter.”</p>
<p>For those of us who still fail to recognise the shifts and changes that have taken place within  Zionism, Edelstein makes it clear: whilst Zionism was initially a plan to re-settle the Jews in Zion, nowadays, to be a Zionist means to stay in the Diaspora, and to &#8216;tweet for Israel&#8217;.  The role of  American, French and British Jews, according to Edelstein,  is to coordinate with Israel, and to  join the Hasbara war: &#8220;Given the provocation by the flotilla,” says Diaspora Minister Edelstein, “we  established a special situation room that will ensure coordination between  Government officials, Diaspora Jewish communities and friends of Israel  around the world.. I  am certain that alongside us will stand significant force multipliers in the  form of thousands of activists from Jewish communities around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not have any doubt that many Jews around the world want nothing to do with Minister Edelstein and his Hasbara initiative.  They are clearly going to ignore his call. I also feel sure that many Jews feel sickened and ashamed to wake up, all too often, into yet another atrocious Israeli war crime.</p>
<p>Yet, if the Israelis themselves clearly regard Diaspora Jews as their ‘foreign brigades’, surely we should also be allowed to look into the issue, and examine the lethal continuum between the Jewish State and its vile supporters around the world.</p>

			<p><strong>The Zionists wield their influence by winning the ongoing propaganda war: Stuart Littlewood&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/stulittlewood3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/stulittlewood2.jpg" alt="Stuart Littlewood" /></a>Stuart Littlewood is a British writer and photographer. He is the co-author of the book &#8220;Radio Free Palestine&#8221; in which he has elaborately described the plight of the Palestinian nation under the Israeli occupation. Littlewood&#8217;s articles on the cause of the Palestinian nation have been published on a variety of websites, newspapers and online magazines including Intifada Palestine, Veterans Today, Palestine Chronicle, Dissident Voice, Ramallah Online and Voltaire Net. In a 2009 interview with Media Review, Littlewood described his contributions to raising the public awareness of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the ignorance of the British people concerning the suffering of the Palestinian nation.</p>
<p>Stuart joined me in an in-depth interview to discuss the ongoing anguish of the people of Palestine, the situation of Gaza Strip and West Bank, the influence of Israeli lobby over the mass media in the West and the international isolation of Iran due to its unconditional support for the Palestinian people.</p>
<p><strong>Kourosh Ziabari: Zionists have always claimed that the </strong><strong>Land</strong><strong> of </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> historically belongs to them and this verdict is clearly emphasized in the Hebrew Bible. They say that according to the Book of Genesis, the land was promised by God to the descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac and to the Israelites, descendants of Jacob, Abraham&#8217;s grandson. So, what&#8217;s your response to them? Do they have the right to cite claims over what is called the </strong><strong>Land</strong><strong> of </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong>? Is there any historical evidence to demonstrate that Palestinians are the true possessors of this land?</strong></p>
<p>Stuart Littlewood: Using mythical scripture to make out that God is a racist who favors one tribe above all others, is bizarre to say the least. Some Zionists don&#8217;t believe it, so why should anyone else? In a booklet called &#8220;<em>Zionism: A Jewish Communal Response</em>&#8221; recently launched by The Board of Deputies of British Jews, Rabbi Tony Bayfield writes: &#8220;I am horrified by some strands of Zionism which treat the Bible as an exclusive title deed written by God. I do not regard the Torah as an extra-historical document written by the Divine hand&#8230; It is not Judaism&#8217;s title deed to the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it provides cover for the Zionists&#8217; criminal scheme to dispossess the Palestinians-Arabs and Christians &#8211; so its importance is pumped up to bursting point. But why any non-Jews should take it seriously is beyond me.</p>
<p>The Jews were expelled by the Roman occupation. These days the right of return must be exercised as soon as the reason for expulsion, for example, foreign occupation, ceases. The Jews had their chance when the Roman  Empire collapsed. They didn&#8217;t take it. It&#8217;s ridiculous to lay claim 16 centuries later at gun-point and eject the people whose homeland it now is. Most of today&#8217;s Jews, I&#8217;m told, have no ancestral links to the Holy  Land anyway.</p>
<p>The <em>Jerusalem</em><em> Declaration of 2006</em> by the Latin Patriarch and Local Heads of Churches sums it up for me: &#8220;We categorically reject Christian Zionist doctrines as a false teaching that corrupts the biblical message of love, justice and reconciliation… We reject the teachings of Christian Zionism that facilitate and support these policies as they advance racial exclusivity and perpetual war…&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Jerusalem itself, it was already 2000 years old and belonged to the Canaanites when King David captured it.  Historians say that before the present-day conflict the Jews controlled Jerusalem for some 500 years, whereas it was subsequently ruled by Muslims for more than twice that long. And for nearly 90 years it was a Christian kingdom. Lots of people, besides the Jews, conquered Jerusalem, so there are many competing claims, which is probably why the UN declared it should be independently administered as an international city.</p>
<p>Matters weren&#8217;t helped when Obama opened his big mouth and declared to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) that Jerusalem &#8220;will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided&#8221;. Realizing it was a stupid thing to say, he added: &#8220;Well, obviously, it&#8217;s going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations&#8230; And I think that it is smart for us to work through a system in which everybody has access to the extraordinary religious sites in Old Jerusalem, but that Israel has a legitimate claim on that city.&#8221; A legitimate claim? As everyone knows, the Old City officially belongs to Palestinian East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a question of the Palestinians proving ownership, though I imagine most families can produce Ottoman-era land deeds &#8211; if the Israelis haven&#8217;t confiscated and forged them.</p>
<p>Hamas chief Khalid Misha&#8217;al has said: &#8220;We shall never recognize the right of any power to rob us of our land and deny us our national rights. We shall never recognize the legitimacy of a Zionist state created on our soil in order to atone for somebody else&#8217;s sins or solve somebody else&#8217;s problem.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t sound unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>KZ: As you mentioned in one of your recent articles, the </strong><strong>UK</strong><strong> Foreign Secretary William Hague has categorically condemned the atrocities committed by the regime of Moammar Gaddafi and the mass killing of Libyan citizens by his mercenaries. The UK government revoked Gaddafi&#8217;s and his family members&#8217; political immunity in an action aimed at threatening the interests of the Libyan dictator worldwide; however, we haven&#8217;t seen any action against or condemnation of the brutal massacre of the defenseless Palestinians by the Israeli regime in the December 2008 and January 2009. What does this exercise of double standards imply? Is it possible to justify it?</strong></p>
<p>SL: It&#8217;s no use looking to the British government for fair play. The political scene here is heavily infiltrated by the pro-Israel lobby, and money talks. The Friends of Israel movement claims 80 per cent of Conservative Party MPs including of course its leader, David Cameron. Membership, I hear, is a necessary stepping stone to high office. Cameron calls himself a Zionist and our foreign secretary, William Hague, has been a Friend of Israel since his schooldays.  His side-kick, Liam Fox, the defense secretary, thinks that &#8220;we must remember that in the battle for the values that we stand for, for democracy against theocracy, for democratic liberal values against repression &#8211; Israel&#8217;s enemies are our enemies and this is a battle in which we all stand together or we will all fall divided&#8221;. The minister for Middle East affairs was an officer of Conservative Friends of Israel.  It&#8217;s all sewn up.</p>
<p>David Cameron recently told Jewish dinner guests: &#8220;With me you have a prime minister whose belief in Israel is indestructible&#8230; I will always be a strong defender of the Jewish people. I will always be an advocate for the State of Israel.&#8221; Cameron, and Brown and Blair before him, are patrons of the Jewish National Fund. Quite simply, Israel is never punished. It is allowed to get away scot-free.</p>
<p>A body called the Committee on Standards in Public Life is supposed to call to account MPs who place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organizations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties, but it too has been infiltrated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see how the British Government rushed to press for a UN mandate to take whatever steps might be necessary to protect Libyan civilians from their bully-boy dictator and wasted no time establishing a no-fly zone and annihilating Qaddafi&#8217;s air defenses. But it stood idly by and watched the Israeli slaughter of Gazan civilians and showed no sign of wanting it stopped.</p>
<p>Headlines this week quoted Hague saying, &#8220;There can be no hiding place for tyrants&#8221;, referring to Qaddafi, but he&#8217;s leading the rush to change our Universal Jurisdiction laws to protect Israel&#8217;s war crimes suspects from arrest. These double standards are the hallmark of a corrupted political class. It can never be justified, but for the moment we&#8217;re stuck with these people.</p>
<p>Hague condemned the recent Jerusalem bomb blast as &#8220;a callous and disgusting act of terrorism&#8221; but he&#8217;s careful not to condemn the almost daily air-strikes by Israel on Gaza&#8217;s civilians. I&#8217;m reading a report now on just one day&#8217;s horror inflicted by the Zionist military on the Occupied Territories that says:</p>
<p>24 hours to 8 am, 23 March 2011</p>
<p>3 air strikes – 7 attacks – 28 raids including home invasions – 8 dead – 15 injured – 1 curfew – 15 taken prisoner – 14 detained – 79 restrictions of movement</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Child, teenager and 3 adults killed in Israeli shelling – homes damaged</p>
<p>Injury and 4 deaths in Israeli air strikes</p>
<p>Agricultural sabotage: farms and homes under Israeli fire in 3 Gaza areas – crops bulldozed</p>
<p>Israeli Navy opens fire on Palestinian fishing boats</p>
<p>Zionist mob smashes on-duty ambulance windscreen</p>
<p>Zionist militants cut down Palestinian olive trees</p>
<p>Night peace disruption and/or home invasions in 8 towns and villages</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Source of statistics: Palestinian Monitoring Group]</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Fourth Geneva Convention puts Contracting Parties under a solemn obligation to act. They don&#8217;t seem to have grasped that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KZ: It&#8217;s widely believed that the Zionist lobby has an enormous influence over the mass media in the </strong><strong>U.S.</strong><strong> and European countries. AIPAC and other influential Zionist circles usually block the publication of materials critical of </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> and its policies, and vilify as anti-Semitist whoever dares question the barbaric conducts of this illegitimate regime. What&#8217;s your idea about the dominance of Zionist lobby over the mainstream media in the West?</strong></p>
<p>SL: You are right to focus on this question. The Zionists wield their influence by winning the ongoing propaganda war. The Arabs, after being on the losing end for decades, still haven&#8217;t learned how to fight it and don&#8217;t show any sign of wishing to. I have put forward proposals for media skills training but it&#8217;s hopeless. Even allowing for the PA being dominated by Israel&#8217;s stooges their failure to address this is not only ignorant but a major strategic blunder.</p>
<p>Last year <em>The Israel Project</em>, a US media advocacy group, produced a revised training manual to help the worldwide Zionist movement maintain its control over the propaganda war, keep their ill-gotten territorial gains and persuade international audiences to accept that their crimes are not only necessary but conform to &#8220;shared values&#8221; between Israel and the civilized West.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a clever document. It teaches how to &#8216;justify&#8217; the slaughter, the ethnic cleansing, the land-grabbing, the cruelty and the blatant disregard for international law and UN resolutions, and give it a sweeter smell. It is designed to have us gullible Americans and Europeans believing that we actually share values with the psychopaths of Israel&#8217;s racist regime and that their abominable behavior deserves our support.</p>
<p>The strategy from the start is to isolate Hamas and rob the resistance movement and the Palestinian population of their human rights&#8230;. It drums into them nonsense like, &#8220;The language of Israel is the language of America: &#8216;democracy,&#8217; &#8216;freedom,&#8217; &#8216;security,&#8217; and &#8216;peace.&#8217; These four words are at the core of the American political, economic, social, and cultural systems, and they should be repeated as often as possible because they resonate with virtually every American.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most mainstream media in the UK are under pro-Israel influence, if not Zionist ownership. The BBC also is heavily biassed and too often broadcasts Israel&#8217;s definition of the situation. However, a small number of outlets, such as Channel 4 News, take an independent line.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the over-representation of Jews in Parliament. If Muslims were over-represented to the same extent they&#8217;d have 200 MPs. And there&#8217;d be a big fuss.</p>
<p>These are not the only issues. It has to be admitted that Israel&#8217;s propaganda people do a good job of cultivating the news media, providing timely briefings and making sure spokesmen with good English are available whenever needed. The Palestinians on the other hand are lazy, disorganised and their embassy here in London is worse than useless. They fail to take media relations seriously so they and their countrymen pay a heavy price.</p>
<p>Nor is it enough to be the crushed victim. Having labels like &#8220;extremist&#8221;, &#8220;militant&#8221; and &#8220;terrorist&#8221; pinned on them, no matter how unjustly, is deeply damaging. The Palestinians must shake off these slurs, but before they can do so Hamas must re-write its objectionable charter and &#8216;re-brand&#8217; itself.</p>
<p>Hamas and Hezbollah are only regarded as terrorists by the White House and Tel Aviv and by US-Israeli stooges and flag-wavers at Westminster and elsewhere. The definition they use describes the antics of the US and Israel perfectly, and the whole situation needs reframing to reflect this.</p>
<p>The resistance movements have work to do on this. The propaganda battle can&#8217;t be won without a properly planned communications strategy skillfully executed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KZ: The 13 May 2010 incursion of IDF commandos into the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was followed by the astounding silence of the international community, United Nations and the </strong><strong>United   States</strong><strong>. No credible investigation was carried out to shed a light on the atrocious attack of </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> on the international peace activists and Tel Aviv never heeded the call of </strong><strong>Turkey</strong><strong> to officially apologize for its criminal action against the peace activist. Let&#8217;s imagine that a third country, for example </strong><strong>Iran</strong><strong>, had attacked the flotilla of Israeli activists in the international waters, killing 9 and injuring tens of others. What would the reaction of international community, UN and the </strong><strong>U.S.</strong><strong> have been? Would they assume the same passive stance and remain silent deafeningly?</strong></p>
<p>SL: Former British MP George Galloway, a mainspring behind the Free Gaza movement, called the assault &#8220;a murderous act of piracy&#8221; on innocent humanitarian aid workers and demanded a wholesale review of the international community&#8217;s relationship with &#8220;the criminal pirate state of Israel&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Israel&#8217;s Mark Regev told BBC TV. &#8220;We did everything we could to avoid violence. They [the aid workers] chose the path of confrontation… This is elementary, we have to defend ourselves.&#8221; He claimed the Israeli boarding party was attacked! The BBC failed to question Israel&#8217;s act of piracy in international waters and its blatant violation of maritime law.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the Israelis did themselves immense damage by attacking the <em>Mavi</em>. They were too stupid to understand how it would be seen as an &#8216;own goal&#8217;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how <em>HMS Cumberland</em> and <em>York</em> magically appeared in the Mediterranean when Hague or prime minister David Cameron snapped their fingers during the Libyan crisis.  Where were these ships when British nationals on the <em>Mavi Marmara</em> and the <em>Dignity</em> and other vessels were being assaulted in international waters and terrorized by Israeli pirates, abducted and thrown in their stinking jails? Why weren&#8217;t they bringing life-saving aid to innocent Palestinians after Israel&#8217;s indiscriminate &#8216;Cast Lead&#8217; blitzkrieg?</p>
<p>Our ships have been protecting victims of Qaddafi, and <em>HMS York</em> unloaded tons of medical supplies and other humanitarian aid for the Benghazi Medical Centre. Israel is still bombing and strafing Palestinian civilians in Gaza with impunity on a daily basis, so when the Libyan crisis dies down I see no reason why <em>York</em> shouldn&#8217;t be loaded up with more supplies and sail for Gaza, along with the rest of the NATO fleet, where the humanitarian crisis continues unabated.</p>
<p>On the Libya situation Hague has been sounding off with loud threats of retribution. &#8220;Crimes will not go unpunished and will not be forgotten; there will be a day of reckoning and the reach of international justice is long,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not imagine Iran attacking the humanitarian flotilla. If Britain and the so-called civilized countries of the West won&#8217;t call Israel&#8217;s bluff and break the blockade let&#8217;s imagine Iran doing so.</p>
<p><strong>KZ: In its resolutions, the United Nations Security Council has always called Israel the occupying power, implicitly attesting to the occupation of Palestinian territories by the Israeli regime; however, no practical steps were ever taken to end the occupation of Palestinian lands by Tel Aviv. Do you know of any effective solution to bring an end to this occupation and hold </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> accountable for the crimes it has committed against the Palestinian nation?</strong></p>
<p>SL: Israel is violating over 30 Security Council resolutions that require action by it and it alone. If any other state in the world were to defy the will of the international community so persistently, it would be subjected to economic and/or military sanctions.</p>
<p>UN resolutions must be implemented and international law enforced. If the international community won&#8217;t act to rein in the delinquent all hopes of global peace will remain in shreds. UN Security Council Resolution 242 (fully binding) affirms among other things the necessity for guaranteeing freedom of navigation through international waterways in the area. The blockade must be broken, if necessary by vessels with an armed escort.</p>
<p>The Israeli regime relies heavily on the EU for its exports and enjoys preferential treatment under the EU-Israel Association Agreement of 1995. An obvious part of the solution would be the suspension of this agreement. Its terms require compliance with the principles of the United Nations Charter placing emphasis on peace, security and regional co-operation, and on the need to contribute to the stability and prosperity of the Mediterranean region and promote understanding and tolerance.</p>
<p>Article 2 says that &#8220;respect for human rights and democratic principle constitute an essential element of this agreement&#8221;. Israel has never complied but continues to reap the benefits. In April 2002 the European parliament, with a large majority, requested the European Commission and the Council of Europe to suspend the agreement, without success. The EU has all the leverage needed but is afraid to use it.</p>
<p>We are maybe halfway through the process of educating and informing Western citizens. There will come a point, I feel sure, when civil societies will be savvi enough to clean up their Zionist-infested politics and force the necessary action. In the meantime the Palestinians need to be heard in Western Europe and the United States. A proper on-the-ball communications and media centre and a radio station should have been established years ago. Iran too needs to improve its image to counter the barrage of smears.</p>
<p>Israel is always trying to upgrade its image, but no amount of marketing gloss can hide the evil beneath.</p>
<p><strong>KZ: What&#8217;s in your view, the reason behind the unconditional support of </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> by the </strong><strong>United   States</strong><strong>? Why does the White House endanger its interests to pay for the atrocities and brutalities of Tel Aviv? Why does it distort its global image in compensation for the suicidal mistakes of </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>SL: The ignorance of your average American citizen plus Jewish domination of major business, media and financial institutions and the whole political fabric.</p>
<p>Another reason why Americans are soft in the head about Israel is the Scofield Bible, which became the standard fodder of fervent Christians. Cyrus Scofield, a sleazy character and convicted criminal, was commissioned to re-write the King James Version of the Bible by inserting Zionist-friendly notes. The aim was to change the Christian view of Zionism by creating and promoting a pro-Zionist subculture within Christianity.  The Oxford University Press used Scofield as the editor, and the Scofield Reference Bible, as it was called, has been a best-seller in America for over 90 years.</p>
<p>It introduced a new worship icon, the modern State of Israel, which did not exist at the time but was already on the drawing board of World Zionist movement.</p>
<p><strong>KZ: A report which is attributed to </strong><strong>CIA</strong><strong> indicates that the political entity of </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> will decline within 20 years. Do you agree with this prediction? Will </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> survive, should the </strong><strong>United States</strong><strong> lift its support and backing for it? Is </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> capable of standing on its own feet without the assistance and endorsement of the </strong><strong>United   States</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>SL: Israel has an attitude problem. I suppose it might survive without US support if it mended its manners drastically. But I doubt if it will ever be able to throw off its pariah status or stop shooting itself in the foot. It will become isolated and slowly crumble. Thanks to its selfish fanaticism and unhinged leadership it will do a great deal of damage in the process.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a good many Jews across the world are not Zionists and are disgusted by Israel&#8217;s conduct, and their number seems to be growing.</p>
<p>And the worldwide boycott and disinvestment movement is making good progress and the effect is hurting Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>So the tide is turning.</p>
<p>US government aid to Israel runs at around $3 billion annually and Israel is not required to account for how it is spent. The money helps pay for Israel&#8217;s costly occupation and the high-tech paraphernalia of military oppression. Most of it violates the US&#8217;s own laws, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to matter to the brainwashed Washington administration. Israel usually gets another $2 to 3 billion in indirect aid &#8211; military support, loan write-offs and special grants. The US has also been paying Egypt and Jordan to buy their co-operation with Israel.</p>
<p>If Americans wake up to what&#8217;s going on and aid is withheld until Israel complied with UN resolutions and international law there would probably be peace. But hostilities would soon flare up again if aid resumed. The tap has to be turned off permanently.</p>
<p><strong>KZ: </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong>&#8216;s illegal nuclear activities are almost known to everyone. Under the pretext of not being a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Israel has deposited more than 200 atomic warheads in its arsenal and the Federation of American Scientists has admitted that Israel is the sole possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. However, in violation of the UNSC resolutions that demand </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong> to bring its nuclear program under the safeguards of IAEA, Tel Aviv is secretly continuing to develop atomic bombs. How should this concern be tackled? Who is responsible for disarming </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>SL: The responsibility is America&#8217;s, because it has encouraged Israel to duck its international obligations. In October 2009 the <em>Washington Times</em> ran a report, by Eli Lake, that Obama had agreed to keep Israel&#8217;s nukes secret by reaffirming a decades-old understanding that allowed Israel to keep a nuclear arsenal without opening it to international inspections.  Under this understanding the US has not pressured Israel to disclose its nuclear weapons or sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which could require Israel to give up its estimated several hundred nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>Israel is never required to honor what it signs up to. Back in 1995 it agreed, with the other parties to the <em>Barcelona Declaration</em>, to &#8220;pursue a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East Zone free of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical and biological, and their delivery systems&#8221; and &#8220;consider practical steps to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as excessive accumulation of conventional arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>There has been no progress, either, on the Security Council&#8217;s demand in resolution 487, passed in 1981, that &#8220;Israel urgently … place its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards&#8221;.</p>
<p>Considering the Zionist regime&#8217;s notorious lack of restraint, it is obvious that Israel&#8217;s 200 (or is it 400?) nuclear warheads pose a massive threat not only to the Middle  East but the rest of the world.</p>
<p>As you say, it is the only state in the region that possesses nuclear weapons (and probably the only one that possesses chemical and biological weapons) while not being a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It has signed but not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Israel has not signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. It has signed but not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. Why not?  Because being a menace is necessary to its ambitions.</p>
<p>Israel is capable of wiping Iran, and every Arab state, off the map at the touch of a button. Its warheads can also be targeted on European cities and, some say, already are.</p>
<p>Despite all this, in the words of Israel&#8217;s chief spin-doctor Mark Regev, &#8220;Israel is very concerned about the Iranian nuclear program. And for good reason. Iran&#8217;s President openly talks about wiping Israel off the map. We see them racing ahead on nuclear enrichment so they can have enough fissile material to build a bomb. We see them working on their ballistic missiles&#8230;  The Iranian nuclear program is a threat, not just to my country, but to the entire region. And it&#8217;s incumbent upon us all to do what needs to be done to keep from proliferating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iran&#8217;s nuclear facilities, including its uranium enrichment facilities, are under IAEA supervision. Strange, isn&#8217;t it, that the West is putting such immense pressure on Iran about its nuclear activities, but not Israel.</p>
<p><strong>KZ: As you may acknowledge, </strong><strong>Iran</strong><strong> is at the forefront of ideological battle with </strong><strong>Israel</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Tehran</strong><strong> has already paid the price for its confrontation with Tel Aviv and championing the cause of the Palestinian people: diplomatic isolation and financial sanctions. What&#8217;s your viewpoint regarding the role of </strong><strong>Iran</strong><strong> in solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?</strong></p>
<p>SL: Here&#8217;s what Israel&#8217;s infamous propaganda handbook says: &#8220;The force undermining peace is Iran and their proxies Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. You must not call Hamas just Hamas. Call them what they are: Iran-backed Hamas. Indeed, when they know that Iran is behind Hamas and Hezbollah, they are much more supportive of Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the sort of poison being pumped out to demonize Iran. The point for the West to remember, I think, is that Iran as a member of the region is entitled to be involved in its affairs. The US, an outsider, isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Back in the 1920s the US State Department described the oil deposits in the Middle East as &#8220;a stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material prizes in world history&#8221;. Since then, its designs on Iraq and Iran have been plain to see.</p>
<p>Nobody has forgotten how the US and Britain schemed to snuff out Dr. Mossadeq&#8217;s first steps towards democracy in the 1950s and reinstated the hated Shah.</p>
<p>The West has betrayed the Palestinians for nearly 100 years and immediately strangled their fledgling democracy when they made an &#8216;inconvenient&#8217; choice in the 2006 election.</p>
<p>Democracy is not what they want to see in the Middle  East. It&#8217;s too uncontrollable.</p>
<p>In the turmoil following Iran&#8217;s presidential election, the country&#8217;s Supreme Leader denounced Britain as the &#8220;most treacherous&#8221; of Iran&#8217;s enemies. Western diplomats, he said, &#8220;are displaying their enmity against the Islamic state, and the most evil of them is the British government&#8221;.</p>
<p>I seem to remember from my own business experience with Tehran that relations between Iran and Britain remained surprisingly good up to the Iran-Iraq war when the UK government pulled the plug on trade. &#8220;Her Majesty&#8217;s Government does not encourage trade with, or investment in, Iran,&#8221; says the government&#8217;s trade website now. &#8220;Nor do we offer any commercial services for companies wanting to do business with Iran. We do not give financial support for trade promotion activities and we do not organize trade missions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turn to Israel and it says: &#8220;Israel is a remarkable success story for British exporters… Bilateral trade has consistently been in excess of £2 billion over the last 10 years and should reach £3 billion by 2015. Companies who dismiss Israel as too small without exploring its potential are overlooking a serious market of solid and regular opportunity. Israel can be seen as the land of opportunity especially in all high tech sectors.&#8221; Words supplied by Tel Aviv&#8217;s scriptwriters, I imagine.</p>
<p>Iran clearly needs more friends in the West. A good move would be to re-establish business links and forge new friendships regardless of silly ministerial hostility.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kenneth  O&#8217;Keefe is a world citizen. As an anti-war activist and social  entrepreneur, he renounced his U.S. citizenship on March 1, 2001 and  burned his American passport on January 7, 2004 in protest to the United  States&#8217; Imperialism and called for the immediate withdrawal of American  forces from Iraq. O&#8217;Keefe is a former U.S. Marine who served in the  1991 Persian Gulf War and subsequently revealed the use of depleted  uranium by the United States as a crime against humanity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">O&#8217;Keefe  has taken part in a number of substantial anti-war movements and served  as the director of Human Shield Action to Iraq. He founded a group of  activists who traveled to Iraq to act as human shields to prevent the  U.S.-led coalition troops from bombing certain locations during the 2003  invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In  2004 O&#8217;Keefe established an association known as the &#8220;P10K Force,&#8221; a  group of 10,000 Westerners intended to act as international observers in  the occupied Palestinian territories and help bring peace with Israel</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In  the fall of 2008, he served as a Captain and 1st Mate with the Free  Gaza Movement, a direct action in which 46 people successfully  challenged the Israeli siege of Gaza</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">O&#8217;Keefe  was one of the international peace activists onboard the Gaza Freedom  Flotilla that was intended to end the Israeli siege of Gaza Strip.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Kenneth  O&#8217;Keefe joined me in an in-depth interview to answer my questions on  his anti-imperialistic viewpoints, the prospect of Israeli-Palestinian  conflict, the continued international controversy over Iran&#8217;s nuclear  program, the chronic hostility between the United States and Iran and  his experiences in the Freedom Flotilla mission.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Kourosh  Ziabari: as an anti-imperialist activist, what&#8217;s in your view, the  source of America&#8217;s enormous imperialistic power? America is a country  with less than 400 years of history; however, it has successfully  transformed the international order, dominated the less powerful  countries around the world and revolutionized the global political  equations. How is it possible for the United States to do so?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Kenneth  O&#8217;Keefe: The world is full of illusions that are used by the rich and  powerful to manipulate and control the people. The greatest illusion,  and the one with the most devastating consequences, is that the American  people and the Israeli, and the British, and numerous others, vote in  their governments and hold them to account. Those who really control the  governments are those powerful few who control the banking systems, the  major multi-national corporations and, of course, the mass media. If  you look beyond the faces of the presidents, prime ministers and  politicians you will see that these governments&#8217; policies remain  virtually the same, no matter who is &#8216;leading&#8217; these countries. These  &#8216;leaders&#8217; do not answer to the people they have pledged to serve; they  answer to those who remain behind the scenes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">These powerful people and entities have key strategic needs in order to maintain power:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1) They must keep the people ignorant and disempowered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2)  They must keep the people divided. They conquer by dividing the people,  never giving people the chance to unite; constantly fostering war by  pitting the masses against each other</p>
<p dir="ltr">This  system has been controlled by the same families for millennia, and  people have been manipulated into a collective state of insanity  throughout. Over the course of this tragic situation, empires have come  and gone, each one giving way to the next. America is simply the latest  in that repeating pattern, and it will fall like all empires do.  However, the powers behind it, those controlling the banking, the  governments and the propaganda, they will remain in place and prop up  the next empire and the pattern will repeat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">We  are constantly looking at the faces that these powers present to us,  the puppets in effect. The powers themselves remain hidden, with many  layers of separation between themselves and the people, and an intricate  and complex legal system to protect and hide them. In the west this  conspiracy has been called a theory, and everything is done to try and  marginalize and ridicule the people who speak correctly about the way  the world works. Until this system and those behind it are exposed, we  will continue our cycle of self-destruction and continue marching  towards a nuclear Armageddon. The most powerful weapon we have is the  truth, and until we yield its full power, we will never have justice and  peace in this world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>KZ:  how is it possible to resist the American Imperialism while the  absolute majority of powerful, wealthy states in the world are the  stalwart allies of Washington and the other developing, underdeveloped  countries are starving of insufficiency and poverty? Even the  Non-Aligned Movement which consists of 118 countries isn&#8217;t capable of  dictating its will to the United States and its European allies. One  clear instance is Iran&#8217;s nuclear program which is favored and supported  by the 118 members of NAM, but fails to prosper due to the objection of  some 5, 6 European countries plus the United States. What do you think?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">KO:  I believe the process of destroying American imperialism is already in  place. The truth is the most powerful weapon of all, and the rise in  popularity of international news stations like Press TV, Al Jazeera  English and RTTV is evidence that people are hungry for the truth they  are denied. Despite a huge effort by the western/Zionist controlled  media to keep people ignorant, and thus divided, they are losing ground  to such important journalistic endeavors that disseminate a truthful  version of world events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The  truth is on our side and it shall set us free. There are many creative  ways to expose the truth, and we must use them to educate people about  how they are being used to maintain the Zionist/Imperialist agenda that  makes the rich richer, and the masses more impoverished. If we  persevere, we can teach those in the west that the portrayal of Muslim  peoples engaged in violent resistance as lunatics and fanatics is simply  a means adopted by the Imperialist propaganda machine to divide and  conquer. If people understand that the only beneficiaries of war are  those who propagate it, we will break free from the tyranny of war,  occupation and the monetary system that enslaves us all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The  people of the world, billions of us, can demand the transformation of  the UN, or replace it with a genuine system that actually does the job  the UN has failed to do since its inception. If we dedicate ourselves to  the task, we can end the five permanent member state system that  neutralizes any power this institution may wield.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The  Non-Aligned Movement is important despite its inability thus far to  effect the greater change required. The NAM is a solid foundation that  we can build on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The  hypocrisy of Israel having undeclared nuclear weapons in the hundreds  while an open nuclear program in Iran is grounds for war is beyond  absurd. War can only take place if the propaganda machine is successful  in keeping people ignorant. I believe that the pre-planned attack on  Iran was scheduled to take place at least a year or two ago. The reason  it has thus far not transpired is that those agents of the truth have  worked tirelessly and effectively to expose the pending attack as the  final confirmation of America&#8217;s monstrous imperialism and the use of  Israel as its vicious attack dog. If America, Israel and Britain, the  true &#8216;Axis of Evil&#8217;, attack, I believe the world will unite against them  in a sufficient manner. Nonetheless, attacks on Iran, Lebanon and Gaza  remain very possible; hence more and more investment in exposing the  truth must be made.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Confronting  the tyrants responsible for the blockade of Gaza is in my opinion a  priority. That is why I am working with a brilliant team of people on  organizing a massive flotilla, with large ships and thousands of  passengers representing every nation on Planet Earth, to break the  blockade.  As well as the Turkish people, I see the Iranian, South  African, Irish, Venezuelan and colonized, aboriginal peoples playing a  substantial role in that mission.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">When  all is said and done, we have a choice between surrendering to our  enslavement or fighting for a just and peaceful world. I feel that the  only way to honor myself, my children and the generations yet unborn is  to fight, with the truth as our ultimate weapon, until justice prevails.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>KZ: </strong><strong>Iran  and U.S. have been at loggerheads over the past 30 years hostilely. Do  you know of any way to bring the two nations closer together, increase  the mutual understanding and promote peace, friendship between the two  adversaries?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">KO:  The primary means of fostering a mutual understanding and friendship  between these two hostile nations is no secret. I repeat my conviction  that the truth is the ultimate weapon, and anything we can do to  propagate the truth is our only option. The American people are a  hard-working, idealistic and honest people who have been gravely  deceived, to their own detriment.  We must strive to educate them, not  in a condescending, patronizing way, but with empathy, understanding  that we too once believed the lies of those we trusted, and were  misguided into actions that caused grave harm to others. Paying taxes is  an example. We must teach them the true history of their nation,  including its part in the formation of Israel. We must understand that  arriving at and accepting the truth is a slow and often painful process,  especially when the realization of the damage caused by our own actions  dawns. Most importantly, we must be there to welcome those who have  traversed the painful road to the truth, and embrace them as our  brothers and sisters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>KZ:  some analysts suggest that the reason behind the United States&#8217;  unconditional support for Israel lies in the fact that Washington wants  to maintain its interests in the Middle East through a proxy  representative. Some others believe that United States supports Israel  on an ideological basis. What&#8217;s your viewpoint?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">KO<strong>:</strong> This ties into my last answer. Israel is simply another face, or front,  if you like, that the hidden powers that be present to the people.  Israel&#8217;s primary function is to maintain perpetual conflict in the  Middle East. Soon enough, Israel will be spreading this conflict on a  global level. I have no doubt that the pending attack on Iran is  intended to take us straight into World War III, with a regional nuclear  war very likely. This is quite obviously a disaster to any sane human  being.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">However,  to those who see their power threatened by the spreading of truth,  9-11, Zionism, the banking system, etc, this is a very necessary act to  help them maintain their grip of control over peoples of the world. This  &#8216;divide and conquer&#8217; strategy has served them well for millennia. On  the surface, war is catastrophic, and it seems incomprehensible that  anyone could stand to benefit from war. In truth, however, the powers  that be become even richer and more powerful as they gain a foothold in  yet another peoples&#8217; territory, and afford themselves access to their  resources, just take Iraq as an example. The looming death and  destruction serves to further divide people and divert them from the  truth. What these powers fear more than anything is people coming  together in the spirit of humanity. Thus, war is the ultimate tool to  prevent the union of the people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>KZ:  Israel&#8217;s lawlessness is troubling the international community  seriously. Israel continues to possess nuclear weapons in violation of  the UNSC resolution 487. It is also keeping up with its despotic  policies in blockading the Gaza Strip and West Bank. How is it possible  to hold Israel accountable for the crimes it commits while the United  States is standing by Israel unreservedly?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">KO:  I believe that Palestine hits at the heart of all injustice, and that  the issue of justice for Palestinians threatens to flagrantly expose the  powers that have made this situation so. The Zionist project has been  invested in heavily, and the powers that be will not relinquish it  lightly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">As  I stated earlier, there is an intricate and sophisticated legal system  that protects the powers that be and enables them to continue their  domination over the peoples of this earth. Two such institutions that  are being used to enable and perpetuate Israel&#8217;s lawlessness are the UN  and the International Criminal Court. I strongly advocate the abolition  of the UN in its present form.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Giving  five permanent member states veto powers over all other states in the  world is an insult to the international community and an affront to the  cause of justice. Universal Jurisdiction and full accountability for  every nation can and will be achieved when we as a people make it so.  Until such time, the United Nations is a cruel joke and the  International Criminal Court is a sham. Both are fronts presented by the  powers that be to convince the people that justice is being  administered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">We  as people must use our finite resources and come together if we are to  effect meaningful change. We are too scattered, fighting each other on  minor details and continually resisting and protesting. We must take a  proactive approach to effecting justice, and do so in a focused,  intelligent, disciplined and fearless way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>KZ:  tell us about your experience on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla. You were  among tens of activists who were brutally beaten and tortured by Israel  while trying to breaking the Gaza blockade. What happened first when  they boarded on your ship? How did they treat you? What was your  reaction? What will be the prospect of Freedom Flotilla?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">KO: The  Israeli attack began under cover of darkness at about 3.40 in the  morning. Within the first five minutes of the attack, even before the  commandos dropped down from the helicopter and boarded our vessel, we  were taking casualties, and the first man was murdered with a gunshot to  the head. Percussion grenades, tear gas, smoke bombs, paintball rounds  and live ammunition were all being used.  It was like a combat  situation, except that one side was not armed with combat weapons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">About one hour after the onset of the attack, I had seen at least five men murdered and dozens of bloody injuries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Twice  during the course of the attack, I was directly confronted by a  commando. In both cases, myself and another defender disarmed  them. During the first confrontation, I took possession of a 9mm pistol,  the same weapon used to kill eight out of the nine men that morning.   During the second, the other defender took possession of the commando&#8217;s  sub-machine gun. A third commando was also disarmed. These three  completely disarmed commandos were taken below deck and treated for any  injuries they might have sustained. Nevertheless, the bravado and  audacity they exhibited while in possession of their lethal weapons  vanished. While in our custody, they looked like frightened little  children.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Soon  after the commandos were captured and subdued a group of about 7 IHH  members escorted the soldiers from the main cabin to the bow of the  ship, released them and walked away.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The  captain of the ship eventually announced via the PA system that the  Israelis had taken control of the ship&#8217;s bridge. He then instructed us  to stop all resistance which we did.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Over  the next several hours, we surrendered to the Israelis one by one. Each  one of us was searched for weapons and then handcuffed. Most of the  men, including myself, were kicked or punched without provocation while  restrained.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">From  this point forward we were treated like dogs. Elderly people were  physically abused, women were sexually abused during bodily searches, we  were all denied water and food, as well as access to a toilet, one  elderly man consequently urinated on himself, and any communication with  lawyers was not allowed. We were lied to incessantly, and had our  personal possessions stolen, including cash, credit cards, laptop  computers, cameras and footage. Of crucial importance, they stole all of  the video and photographic footage that without doubt shows them  murdering people in cold blood.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It  was clear to all of us in Israeli custody that we were being held  captive by a force that had completely lost the ability to see others as  human beings. These people are thoroughly brainwashed to believe  themselves God&#8217;s &#8216;chosen ones&#8217;, and thus they believe they have the  right to treat all others as animals. Many of us were beaten while in  their custody on land, after being beaten on the ship.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">On  our arrival in the Port of Ashdod, I handed them my Palestinian  passport &#8211; I had previously hidden my Irish passport on the ship. Many  of the Israeli soldiers knew of me from my previous activities, so this  just incensed them. I refused to sign any deportation papers, or any  statement that I would never attempt re-entry to Gaza or the Occupied  Palestinian Territories. I demanded to appear before a judge in  court. My internment was illegal, and I wanted to be repatriated to  Gaza. Eventually I was deported from Israel, I was one of the very last  to go.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Two  days after my deportation the IDF spokesperson issued a press release  identifying me as a &#8220;terror operative&#8221; who was traveling to Gaza to  &#8220;train a commando unit for Hamas.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">These  charges are beyond ridiculous, and it seems to me they were made to  gloss over the IDF&#8217;s embarrassment at having one of the most elite  forces in the world disarmed and humiliated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It  is the nature of the Zionist Israeli propaganda machine to levy such  grave charges on those who resist their aggression. War crimes,  mass-murder, piracy, lying, torture, organ theft, Apartheid, ethnic  cleansing and crimes against humanity are justified at every turn, and  the blame shifted to those who defend themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It  was a real honor to be aboard the Mavi Marmara with my Turkish brothers  and sisters. The Turkish people have the kind of strength and courage  required to face a force such as the Israelis and defend their mission  as if they were defending their own children. Fearless resistance of  proactive measures is what is needed to face the Israeli monster that is  killing, maiming and destroying the lives of countless people,  including over 800,000 children in Gaza. We must see those children as  our children, and we must defend them as such.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I  appreciate all efforts put forth to bring an end to the suffering of  the Palestinians at the hands of the Israelis. However, I do not believe  that the flotilla leaving this month or next has either the scale, or  the courageous elements, namely active resistance by the participants,  essential for success. I cannot see the blockade being broken unless we  as people of conscience from around the world do everything in our power  to neutralize the might of the Israeli military. I know this is  possible, and soon a plan will be revealed for a flotilla in 2011 that  has the potential to achieve the goal of breaking the blockade once and  for all. This plan will require several large ships and most definitely a  strong Turkish presence. A delegation representing this plan will soon  be arriving in Iran as well as numerous other countries to put this plan  to the people, and we shall see if the people of the world decide to  make it a reality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>KZ: </strong><strong>how  do you assess the prospect of Israeli regime? Given its continued  violation of the international law and its aggressive subjugation of the  Palestinian nation, is Tel Aviv going to survive politically?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">KO:  No. The Zionist regime will not survive any more than the Nazi regime  or the South African Apartheid regime. The Zionists will go the same  way. God is God of all people, not one group, one way or the other the  Zionists will learn this. The people of conscience will ensure that  justice prevails. Gaza will rise from the ashes and be a thriving  metropolis once more. Palestine will be united and reborn because the  will of the people, and their cogent action, will have made it so. It is  vital that we envision, and never cease working for, that day.  Palestine hits at the heart of all injustice, and when we solve this  problem we set the stage for a world worthy of handing down to our  children. This is our ultimate worldly calling.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Press-TV3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/Press-TV2.jpg" alt="Press TV" /></a>To tell the truth about Israeli barbarism is a breach of impartiality.<strong> </strong>The <a href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/?id=102202&amp;story=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/aug/02/press-tv-gaza-flotilla">Guardian</a> and the <a href="http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/36397/ofcom-raps-press-tv">Jewish Chronicle</a> reported today that, Ofcom, the UK broadcasting standards body, has  ruled that Iranian-backed Press TV’s coverage of the Gaza flotilla  incident breached guidelines on impartiality.</p>
<p>You ask yourself why?</p>
<p>Their coverage of the Flotilla wasn’t pro-Israeli enough.</p>
<p>The regulator said the station had not shown due impartiality during a  broadcast on June 5th which dealt exclusively with the events  surrounding the interception by Israeli commandos of the pro-Palestinian  convoy off the coast of Gaza.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gilad.co.uk/storage/Lauren-Booth_799801c.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1280835580979" alt="" width="249" height="155" />The  Jewish Chronicle reports that During an episode of a current affairs  show Remembering Palestine, presenter Lauren Booth discussed the  flotilla with studio guests and participants of the convoy. Ofcom said  the show had started with “a pro-Palestinian song set to  anti-Israeli/pro-Palestinian imagery”.</p>
<p>Ofcom is absolutely right,  Booth should have thought about it, and  played Hava Nagila along with the images of Israel executing 9 peace  activists in International waters.  Such an act would bring to light the  cheerful aspect in Israeli murderous zeal. It would also cement the  cultural continuum between the IDF’s crimes and Jewish cultural  heritage.</p>
<p>Watch the Israeli execution on the Mavi Marmara</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi6c10ntFZk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi6c10ntFZk</a></p>
<p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Pi6c10ntFZk&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Pi6c10ntFZk&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>The watchdog said comments made by Ms Booth and her guests “could be  interpreted as being highly critical of the actions of the Israeli  government and its military forces”.  The comments included: Lauren  Booth saying: “Israeli commandos…committed a massacre of innocent  civilians sailing aid ships to the besieged Gaza Strip.”</p>
<p>I am slightly puzzled  here, how would Ofcom suggest to call a  deliberate execution of civilians in the middle of the night? Is there a  better word in English to describe the event?</p>
<p>Booth also said “This was obviously a barbarous attack on civilians.  One thing is certain: As Turkey buries its murdered citizens…the brave  men and women on those ships, in one move, have shifted world opinion  against Israeli apartheid.”</p>
<p>Obviously, Booth was very observant, just five days after the Israeli  massacre she gathered that the world has changed. Now we all see Israel  and its supporters for what they are.  I guess that the video above  shows clearly a deliberate murderous act. I think that Ofcom should  visit Youtube, they can also wait for the results of the UN fact finding  mission into Israel&#8217;s murdering on the Mavi Marmara.</p>
<p>On a further note, I just wonder, if  the British press is not  allowed to tell the truth about Israel, who exactly is going to stop  Israel from using its nuclear bombs?  How should we protest against  Israeli war crimes?   Should we count on the Conservative Friends of  Israel to do the job?   Or even  Kenneth  Clark  who under the Israeli  Lobby pressure moved quickly to <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/07/war-crimes-livni-universal">block war crimes prosecutions in the UK</a> so “The likes of Henry Kissinger, Tzipi Livni and Ehud Barak could slip a little easier” into the UK.</p>
<p>I would use this opportunity to say thanks for Press TV and Lauren  Booth for being there. I am certain, that such publicity will bring many  more viewers to the one and only broadcaster in the UK that tells the  truth about Israeli crimes and the <a href="http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/big-story-the-jewish-lobby-in-britain.html">Israeli Lobby</a> in Britain.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/flotilla-raid3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/flotilla-raid2.jpg" alt="congress" /></a>In “<a href="http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=442&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=4402&amp;TTL=The_Legal_Basis_of_Israel%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99s_Naval_Blockade_of_Gaza" target="_blank">The Legal Basis of Israel’s Naval Blockade of Gaza</a>” at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA), Professor Emeritus of International Law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Ruth Lapidoth argues that Israel’s attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, in which nine Turkish peace activists were killed by Israeli commandos, was perfectly “legal”.</p>
<p>Lapidoth  begins by arguing that “the rules of the laws of armed conflict apply”  to the “armed conflict” between Israel and Hamas. From this, Lapidoth  draws the conclusion that, “This means that Israel may control shipping  headed for Gaza—even when the vessels are still on the high seas.”</p>
<p>Examining how the conclusion that Israel may legally blockade  Gaza is arrived at, Lapidoth argues that: “The rules on blockades are  based on customary international law, as there is no comprehensive  international treaty on this subject…. The customary rules on blockade  can be found in the manuals of the laws of war issued by certain Western  countries such as the United States and Britain. In addition, there is a  manual prepared by an international group of experts in 1994 called the  San Remo Manual.”</p>
<p>By claiming that we must depend upon “customary international law” to decide whether or not a blockade  is legal or not, Lapidoth implies that the body of formal international  law is somehow irrelevant and inapplicable. The reason for this  argument becomes perfectly clear when one actually examines what  international law has to say about Israel’s deadly attack on a  humanitarian vessel in international waters, which reveals that this  entire foundational premise for the argument is false.</p>
<p>For instance, Israel as a party to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml" target="_blank">U.N. Charter</a>,  which states that: “All Members shall settle their international  disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and  security, and justice, are not  endangered…. All Members shall refrain in their international relations  from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or  political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent  with the Purposes of the United Nations” (Article 2).</p>
<p>The  prescription for seeking remedy to an international dispute or  grievance is given: “The parties to any dispute, the continuance of  which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation,  conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional  agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice”  (Article 33).</p>
<p>For Member states, it is up to the U.N. Security  Council to “determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach  of the peace, or act of aggression” and to “make recommendations, or  decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and  42, to maintain or restore international peace and security” (Article 39).</p>
<p>If the Security  Council finds such a situation exists, it may authorize the use of  force “as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace  and security”, including the implementation of a “blockade” (Article 42).</p>
<p>Thus, Israel has a legal obligation to bring any grievances it may have to the U.N. Security Council, which may authorize and enforce a blockade. Yet, Israel has never sought U.N. authorization for a blockade as a remedy for any grievance, and the Security Council has <em>not </em>authorized the blockade of Gaza. Israel’s unilateral blockade, being in contravention to its obligations under the U.N. Charter, is therefore unlawful.</p>
<p>Israel is also party to the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/380?OpenDocument" target="_blank">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>,  which according to Lapidoth’s own argument, applies. The Convention  prohibits any acts constituting collective punishment of a civilian  population: “No protected person may be punished for an offence he or  she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all  measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited” (Article 33).</p>
<p>Under  the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel is legally bound to allow  humanitarian shipments into Gaza: “To the fullest extent of the means  available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food  and medical supplies of the  population; it should, in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs,  medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied  territory are inadequate” (Article 54).</p>
<p>Additionally:  “If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is  inadequately supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes  on behalf of the said population, and shall facilitate them by all the  means at its disposal”, including “consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies  and clothing.” Israel is legally obligated to “permit the free passage  of these consignments” and to “guarantee their protection” (Article 59).</p>
<p>Israel’s blockade of humanitarian shipments into Gaza <em>ipso facto </em>constitutes an act of collective punishment against the civilian population, and is therefore illegal.</p>
<p>Lapidoth acknowledges that “A blockade  has to permit the passage of humanitarian assistance if needed”, but  adds: “However, the San Remo Manual includes two conditions (in Article  103): first, the blockading party may decide where and when and through  which port the assistance should reach the coast. In addition, the state  may require that a neutral organization on the coast should control the  distribution of the items.”</p>
<p>Yet, as shall be seen, these conditions only apply in cases where there is a lawful blockade  to begin with; which means they don’t apply in Israel’s case. It’s  instructive that Lapidoth, far from disputing the fact, tacitly  acknowledges here that the Israeli blockade denies the passage of  humanitarian assistance; thus the necessity of his legalistic,  cherry-picked argument. A look at the document cited reveals that  Lapidoth is simply not being honest about what the San Remo Manual  actually says.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/380?OpenDocument" target="_blank">San Remo Manual</a> applies to “armed conflict at sea” (Article 1). Yet there is no armed  conflict at sea in this case. Gaza has no navy (nor does it have an army  or air force). Attacks against Israel are limited to rockets fired by  militant groups from the land against targets on the land. Nonetheless,  let us consider that a state of “armed conflict” exists and presume the  principles of the San Remo Manual are fully applicable.</p>
<p>The  Manual explicitly states that: “The principles of necessity and  proportionality apply equally to armed conflict at sea and require that  the conduct of hostilities by a State should not exceed the degree and  kind of force, not otherwise prohibited by the law of armed conflict,  required to repel an armed attack against it and to restore its security” (Article 3).</p>
<p>“Parties  to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between civilians or  other protected persons and combatants and between civilian or exempt  objects and military objectives” (Article 39).</p>
<p>“In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military  action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or  neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a  definite military advantage” (Article 40).</p>
<p>“Attacks shall be limited strictly to military objectives. Merchant vessels … are civilian objects unless they are military objectives in accordance with the principles and rules set forth in this document” (Article 41).</p>
<p>Moreover,  “it is forbidden to employ methods or means of warfare which … are of a  nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering” or “are  indiscriminate, in that … they are not, or cannot be, directed against a  specific military objective” (Article 42).</p>
<p>Israel had an obligation to take “precautions” in its attack, such as “determining whether or not objects which are not military objectives are present in an area of attack”, to “do everything feasible to ensure that attacks are limited to military  objectives”, and to “take all feasible precautions in the choice of  methods and means in order to avoid or minimize collateral casualties or  damage”. Additionally, “an attack shall not be launched if it may be  expected to cause collateral casualties or damage which would be  excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the attack as a whole” (Article 46).</p>
<p>Lapidoth,  in citing the San Remo Manual to support an argument that Israel’s  attack on the Mavi Marmara was legal, neglects to point out that the  Manual states explicitly that among the “classes of enemy vessels” that  “are exempt from attack” are “vessels engaged in humanitarian missions,  including vessels carrying supplies indispensable to the survival of the  civilian population, and vessels engaged in relief actions and rescue  operations” and “passenger vessels when engaged only in carrying  civilian passengers” (Article 47).</p>
<p>Furthermore,  the San Remo Manual states that a prerequisite for any lawful blockade  is a declaration that “shall specify the commencement, duration,  location, and extent of the blockade and the period within which vessels  of neutral States may leave the blockaded coastline” (Article 94).  Israel has never made a declaration meeting these requirments.</p>
<p>And  to be lawful, “A blockade must be effective. The question whether a  blockade is effective is a question of fact” (Article 95). Israel’s  blockade is not effective towards any military objective whatsoever,  having served only to deny humanitarian shipments into Gaza.</p>
<p>Even  if Israel had made a proper declaration of its intent, the Manual notes  that: “The declaration or establishment of a blockade is prohibited if …  it has the sole purpose of starving the civilian population or denying  it other objects essential for its survival” or if “the damage to the  civilian population is, or may be expected to be, excessive in relation  to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the  blockade” (Article 102).</p>
<p>Lapidoth  also acknowledges that “there is the condition that a state may not  starve the civilian population (San Remo, Article 102).” Lapidoth makes  no further comments on this condition for the “legality” of a naval  blockade, despite the fact that the blockade prevents food from entering  Gaza.</p>
<p>Even if one could argue that blocking humanitarian supplies was not the <em>sole </em>purpose  of Israel’s blockade, the fact remains that the continuing suffering of  the civilian population was and is a predictable consequence of  Israel’s actions, which are indiscriminate, disproportionate, and  otherwise excessive in relation to any possible legitimate military  objective.</p>
<p>Apologists for the Israeli attack on the <em>Mavi Marmara</em>,  the flagship ship of the flotilla, have claimed that the nine activists  were killed in an Israeli act of “self-defense” against passengers  aboard the ship who attacked Israeli commandos with clubs and knives.  But whether or not it is true that passengers attacked the commandos who  stormed their ship is irrelevant, since (a) Civilians aboard a peaceful  vessel operating in international waters have an inherent right to  self-defense against armed aggression, such as the storming of their  ship by armed Israeli commandos, and (b) the Israeli attack, being  against a civilian and not a military target, as discussed above, was a  war crime in and of itself. The murder of nine peace activists is thus a  <em>further </em>crime.</p>
<p>According to  the absurd logic of the argument to the contrary, the burglar who  breaks into a home and kills the homeowner who attacks him with a knife  commits no crime because he killed the homeowner in “self-defense”.</p>
<p>Continuing,  Lapidoth argues that “A merchant ship may be visited, searched, or  captured; and if the ship resists, it may be attacked…. A ship that  clearly intends to breach the blockade can be dealt with while it is  still on the high seas. Stopping the flotilla in international waters  100 kilometers from Israel was legal: In time of armed conflict, ships  breaching the blockade may be searched even on the high seas.”</p>
<p>Yet  what the San Remo Manual actually states, and what Lapidoth  conveniently ignores, is that the “visit and search” of “merchant  vessels” must occur only when “there are reasonable grounds for  suspecting that they are subject to capture” (Article 118).</p>
<p>There  were absolutely no reasonable grounds to suspect that the Mavi Marmara  or the rest of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla were “subject to capture”—that  is to say, that they served any kind of military purpose or that  preventing the humanitarian shipment served any kind of military  objective whatsoever.</p>
<p>The flotilla  was forcibly redirected Israel. Yet the San Remo Manual specifically  notes that under international law, it is only “with its consent” that a  merchant vessel my “be diverted from its declared destination” (Article  119). Israel’s diversion of the flotilla was not done with consent, but  under threat of violence and with force of arms, a further violation of  international law.</p>
<p>Lapidoth cites  precedents of blockades during the Korean War, the Iran-Iraq war, and  others, concluding again that, “In the treatment of the flotilla heading  for Gaza, Israel has acted in compliance with international law because  it has fulfilled all the conditions for a lawful blockade” because  “Israel notified the relevant authorities of its blockade in Gaza”.</p>
<p>It’s  not clear what relevance Lapidoth thinks previous instances of  blockades have to do with the situation in Gaza, and it does not follow  from the observation that there have been blockades in the past that  therefore Israel “has acted in compliance with international law”.  Lapidoth’s claim that because Israel “notified” authorities of its  blockade it is “in compliance with international law” is also a <em>non sequitur</em>.  As already noted, Israel has never declared its intentions in such a  manner as the San Remo Manual states is required for such a blockade,  among the other conditions outlined above, for its blockade to be  considered legitimate and lawful.</p>
<p>Asking  “Can Gaza be considered an enemy although it is not a state?” Lapidoth  answers: “According to international law, this is possible.” In the  brief discussion that follows, Lapidoth offers no logical rationale for  how this conclusion was arrived at. But assuming it’s a correct  conclusion, it does not follow that because Gaza can be considered enemy  territory that the blockade is legal.</p>
<p>Finally,  Lapidoth address the question of whether Israel is, under law, the  Occupying Power in Gaza. “Some say that since Israel is still in control  of Gaza’s airspace and adjacent sea, Israel is still the occupier”,  Lapidoth notes, without identifying who “Some” are. “According to  another opinion,” Lapidoth continues, “under the Hague Regulations of  1907 (Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land), occupation has to  include full control of the area. (‘Territory is considered occupied  when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army. The  occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been  established and can be exercised.’ – Article 42), and of course Israel  does not control the whole territory of Gaza. Therefore, it is not  responsible for what happens there.”</p>
<p>Lapidoth  concludes, “In my opinion, since Israel is not in control of Gaza, it  is not the occupier, but in those areas in which Israel still has  control – which means sea and airspace – Israel is responsible. Here we  have to distinguish between full control of the territory and control  only of the sea and airspace.”</p>
<p>But this is argument is <em>prima facie</em> invalid. Article 42 simply does not say a nation must “control the  whole territory” for the conditions of an occupation to exist. This is a  strawman argument. Moreover, it is simply false that Israel maintains  “control only of the sea and airspace” of Gaza. Israel also controls  most of the length of the border of the territory, other than the short  stretch of it Gaza shares with Egypt. Israel cannot on one hand claim  authority to militarily control Gaza’s land, sea, and airspace while on  the other maintaining that the conditions of occupation do not exist.  Two plus two does not equal five.</p>
<p>In  sum, Israel has a legal obligation under the U.N. Charter to bring forth  any grievances it has to the Security Council, which may then authorize  a legal blockade if it thinks necessary. Yet Israel did not do so,  choosing rather to unlawfully implement a unilateral blockade.</p>
<p>Israel  has a legal obligation to permit humanitarian supplies into Gaza, and  not to engage in indiscriminate warfare or inflict collective punishment  on the civilian population of Gaza. Yet on its face, collective  punishment is the effective consequence of the blockade and Israel’s  denial of aid.</p>
<p>Moreover, preventing  ships known to be carrying only humanitarian supplies from entering Gaza  in no demonstrable way helps Israel “to repel an armed attack” or “to  restore its security”.  By failing to distinguish between civilian  objects and military objectives, Israel’s attack on the flotilla was  indiscriminate, and therefore prohibited.</p>
<p>By  blocking humanitarian goods that serve no military purpose, Israel’s  attack constituted collective punishment against the civilian  population, and therefore prohibited.</p>
<p>Additionally,  since it could be foreseen that sending armed commandos to threaten and  forcibly board and take control of a ship inherently presents a risk of  causing “collateral casualties” excessive in relation to any military  advantage anticipated (which was totally <em>nonexistent</em> in this case), it was therefore prohibited and constituted a war crime.</p>
<p>Lapidoth’s  argument that there are “conditions” under international law by which  its actions were lawful is a fallacy dependent upon dishonest  cherry-picking from the San Remo Manual, which makes clear that those  conditions only apply to situations where there is an effective legal  blockade necessary for security that is not in practice indiscriminate,  and only when, following on those conditions, there are reasonable  grounds to believe that a ship may be serving a military purpose and  thus exempt from attack. Israel’s capture and redirecting of the  flotilla to Israel was a <em>further </em>violation of international law, in <em>addition</em> to the initial attack and the blockade itself.</p>

			<p>A talk given at the &#8220;Debunking  the War on Terror&#8221; Symposium on July 14th</p>
<p><strong>The War on Terror Within<br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/muglarge3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/muglarge2.jpg" alt="crucifix Jesus" /></a>1 The more pain we inflict on others the more we become familiar with  evil, aggression and brutality.</p>
<p>1.1  The more cruel we are towards others, the more devastated we are  by the possibility that  the subjects of our brutality may also be as  nasty as we happen to be.</p>
<p>1.2   According to Freud this is what projection is all about.</p>
<p>1.2.1 Otto Weininger refines it, ‘we hate in others, that which we  don’t like in ourselves’ he says.</p>
<p>1.3  As it happens, the dynamic of projection is amplified once the  subject of our terror is hopeless and defenseless.</p>
<p>1.3.1 The reason is obvious. The more hopeless the subject of our  terror is, the more we are inclined to face our relentless viciousness  first hand.</p>
<p>2      Israeli treatment of the Palestinians is a devastating example  of the above. The more hopeless and defenseless the Palestinians are,  the more vicious the Israeli becomes.</p>
<p>2.1   And yet, the more vicious the Israeli is, the more he or she is  horrified by ‘terror’.</p>
<p>3      In reality, the Israelis are actually horrified by their own  cruelty which they project onto others.</p>
<p>4      The recent cold-blooded murder of 11 peace activists in the  high seas by Israeli Navy commandos was nothing but a shocking exposure  of that lethal dynamic. The more ethically transparent, innocent and  harmless the humanitarian mission to Gaza is, the more lethal the  Israeli becomes.</p>
<p><strong>The English Speaking Empire</strong></p>
<p>5. In fact, Israel is just a micro-cosmos of this kind of brutal  vicious circle.</p>
<p>6. The so-called ‘War Against Terror’ is in fact a war against the  terror within.</p>
<p>6.1 We attack, rob and plunder innocent people and innocent nations.  Yet, the more pain we inflict on them the more terrorised we become by  our own endless brutality.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ Super Star </strong><em> </em></p>
<p>7. Jesus taught us how to dismantle our vindictive projection. ‘Turn  the other cheek’, he preached, in opposition to the infamous Old  Testament’s ‘eye for an eye’.</p>
<p>7.1 Turning the other cheek, is commonly realised as a means to  counter an aggressor. However, it maybe the only possible measure to  dismantle the ‘terror within’, that same aggression that brews inside us  as we become vindictive.</p>
<p>7.1.1 By turning the other cheek we may manage to defuse the violence  within us. We replace it with acceptance, we disarm ourselves. We give  peace a chance.</p>
<p><strong>From Promised Land to Promised Planet</strong></p>
<p>8. Zionism presented itself initially as a Jewish nationalist  patriotic movement aimed at becoming both a homecoming and a dwelling.</p>
<p>8.1 Zionism vowed initially to collect Jews from around the world and  to bring them to Palestine. It was inspired by the idea of a national  home in a ‘promised land.’</p>
<p>8.2 This is definitely not the case anymore. Zionism took a different  route. It actually expects the Diaspora Jews to mount pressure on  Western governments and media. Wolfowitz was very productive in shaping  America’s interests and desires, as <a href="http://www.medialens.org/alerts/08/080110_david_aaronovitch_a.php">was  David Aaronovitch</a> in championing ‘moral interventionist’ wars in <em>The  Times</em>, <a href="http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/26593/war-crimes-will-government-ever-act">David  Miliband </a> fulfilled his duty fighting to amend British Universal  Jurisdiction within the British cabinet to allow Israeli war criminals  to visit this Kingdom. Alan Dershowitz  managed to transform the   American academic world into a Yeshiva. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/10/100510fa_fact_bruck">Haim  Saban,</a> the Israeli American tycoon, bankrolls the Democratic party  when he isn’t buying American media outlets or funding a new think tank.</p>
<p>8.3 The Israelis realised a long time ago that it is far cheaper to  buy the entire Western political system than buy a single tank.</p>
<p>8.4 Zionism has become a global movement with global interests.</p>
<p>8.4.1 It drifted from the discourse of ‘promised land’ into the  politics of ‘promised planet’</p>
<p>8.5 Consequently, British and American soldiers are dying in growing  numbers fighting Zionist wars.</p>
<p>8.6 More concerning is the fact that British and American people have  been made  complicit in a genocide driven by Zionists<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>8.7 However, the most troubling issue here is the fact that Brits and  Americans are  driven by an Old Testament vindictive ideology, namely  an ‘eye for an eye’. One would have expected that considering the  Christian foundation of Britain and the USA these countries would be  inspired by compassionate Christian ideas such as ‘love your neighbour’  and ‘turn the other cheek.’</p>
<p><strong>The Open Society and Its Enemies</strong></p>
<p>9  Historians will have to find out at what point in time British and  American political power and media gave up<strong> </strong>on  compassion and peace.</p>
<p>9.1 Yet, in order to do so, historians must be free to think and to  say what they think.</p>
<p>9.1.1 We must, therefore, restore the respected notion of history and  the notion of historical research.  We have to make sure that every  chapter in our past is academically accessible. We also must reinstate  freedom of thought, speech and expression. These crucial and elementary  human rights have been jeopardised in the name of political correctness  and legislation.</p>
<p>9.2 History is founded on the belief that a deeper understanding of  the past may help us to shape our future.</p>
<p>9.3 Such an idea is transparent enough to support the realisation  that history can lead to peace and reconciliation. We can simply try to  amend the horror of the past by adopting a peaceful thinking.</p>
<p>9.3.1 To turn the other cheek is to some extent  a product of proper  historical realisation. It suggests that violence leads to more  violence, yet, endurance and self control bring peace about.</p>
<p>10 Devastatingly enough, Britain and America implement the opposite  lesson. Rather than <strong>aim</strong> towards peace and  reconciliation, we are actually committing more and more crimes in the  name of the past. Like the Israelis who kill in the name of the Shoa, we  kill in the name of ‘democracy’, ‘moral interventionism’ and even ‘<em>coca-cola’. </em>As if this is not enough, when we run out of reasons, like the  Israelis we kill in the name of Jewish suffering.</p>
<p>11 It doesn’t take a genius to gather that the proponent of these  precepts in our midsts are devoted Zionists. It doesn’t take a genius to  gather that Wolfowitz’s Doctrine lead to the war in Iraq. It is  literally transparent that the ‘moral interventionism’ that is advocated  by David Miliband, Aaronovitch and Nick Cohen is a pretext for  violence. It is not exactly a  secret that when Britain was taken into  illegal Iraq war,  Lord Levy, a Zionist by admission, was Labour&#8217;s No 1  fund raiser.</p>
<p><strong>Give History a Chance</strong></p>
<p>12 Our vision and re-vision of the past can shape our future, and  yet, our vision of the future can also shape our past.</p>
<p>12.1 I will try to enlighten this complicated idea through a simple  yet devastating hypothetical and imaginary lethal war scenario:</p>
<p>We, for instance, can envisage a horrific situation created by an  imaginary hypothetical  Israeli nuclear attack on Iran in which millions  of innocent people die every day. I guess that amongst the few  survivors of such a horrific reality, some may be so bold to insist that  ‘the history of Jewish suffering might make sense after all.’</p>
<p>Again the above scenario is a product of the imagination, it by no  means justifies Jewish suffering,  and yet, such a vision of a  ‘possible’ horrific development should ideally stop Zionist enthusiasts  from advocating a war against Iran or anyone else. However, the above  fictional scenario should help us to grasp how a vision of the future  can also amend or transform our comprehension of the past.</p>
<p>12.2 At the moment our history books are sealed and cemented. We  cannot engage in a real study of our most relevant past and we are  therefore denied  the right to consider its meaning.</p>
<p>12.3 Consequently, we have failed to encompass the real ethical  meaning of world war II and the holocaust in particular. Similarly, we  are silenced when it comes to the events that led towards the  2<sup>nd</sup> Iraq War. We are supposed to wait for the current Iraq Inquiry with the  almost absurd hope that rabid Zionist <a href="http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/britain-you-better-wake-up-by-gilad-atzmon.html">Martin  Gilbert</a> will be kind enough to show us the truth.</p>
<p>13. With history being squashed it is hardly surprising that the same  people who flattened Hamburg, Pforzheim, Dresden, Hiroshima and  Nagasaki continued to do the same in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and  Iraq.</p>
<p>14. Similarly, the same lobbies that pushed Britain and America to a  deadly confrontation with the Muslim world are now pushing us to flatten  Iran.</p>
<p>15. To save the world and to bring peace about, we must learn our  past and we must be free to so.  Revisionism is the means towards a  better future.</p>
<p><strong>Give History a Chance. </strong></p>

			<p><em> The Israeli recipe for dealing with the world: “If force does not work, use more force.”</em> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/TurkeyKey3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/TurkeyKey2.jpg" alt="comic" /></a>Bombs go off in Turkey &#8212; a  great spree  of terrorist bombings and attacks. Practically every day Turkish  soldiers and  civilians are being killed. The killings are done ostensibly by the Kurd   terrorists of the PKK, but in reality it is a new step in Israel’s  warfare  against Turkish independence. Encouraged by Israel, the PKK has extended  its  operations to the Aegean and the Black Sea resorts all the way to Izmir.</p>
<p>Israelis have armed, supplied  and  trained Kurdish terrorists for many years; they have turned Iraqi  Kurdistan into  their own territory, with <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/report-idan-ofer-visited-kurdistan-1.298197"> many Israeli businessmen</a> going about their affairs while waiting for Kirkuk oil to flow to Haifa as it did in the  days of  colonial British rule. The Kurds have remained a hidden tool of Israel  in the  region for many years; their activation now shows that Israel still  wants to  teach the Turks a lesson.</p>
<p>The main neocon   magazine in the US, frontpagemag.com, has openly  <a href="http://frontpagemag.com/2010/06/24/turkeys-deception/"> called</a> for  the Kurds to retaliate for Turkey’s support of Palestine. Another Jewish   right-wing think-tank  <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2010/06/21/congressmen-talk-turkey/"> speaks</a> of  mobilizing the US Congress to condemn the one-hundred-year-old Armenian  tragedy  as a means of undermining Turkey.  After many years of siding with  Turkey, the  Jewish Lobby has now decided to switch sides and support the Armenian  claims. So  Turkey is now under attack from all sides. This was to be expected, for  the  popular Israeli slogan says: “If force does not work, use more force.”</p>
<p>This is the explanation of the  Flotilla  Massacre on May 31, 2010. The <em>Mavi</em> <em>Marmara</em> attack was intended to be a  short,  sharp shock to the increasingly independent Turks. The Israelis intended  to  terrify and frighten them into obedience; this is why they ordered a  blood bath  on board the <em>Mavi</em> <em> Marmara</em>. As we now know, the Israeli commandos began shooting  well  before encountering any resistance. They were not there to play  softball;  submission was what they were after. Murder was not a result of being  surprised  or of miscalculation: it was an open attack on Turkey.</p>
<p>Israel’s conflict with Turkey  was not an  unfortunate result of the murderous raid. The confrontation between them  became  acute two weeks before the massacre, on May 17, 2010. Together with  Brazil,  Turkey had arranged and signed the Tehran Declaration &#8212; a nuclear fuel  swap  deal with beleaguered Iran. This declaration could have derailed the  US-Israeli  plans of sanctioning Iran to death prior to bombing it.</p>
<p>Israel wants Iran destroyed; as  much as  she wanted Iraq demolished, Gaza starved and the rest cowed. The swap  agreement  undermined all the logic behind the sanctions. All the plotting of  Israeli  lobbyists in the US and Europe was wiped out in an instant. Indeed, as  the  Muslims say: they plot, but Allah plots better.</p>
<p>Israel received the news of the   Turkey-Brazil-Iran agreement as a heavy blow. “We were defeated by the  crafty  Turks and Iranians,” read the headlines of Israeli newspapers. Not so  fast! The  US State Department minimized the damage, effectively  <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/u-s-turkey-brazil-fuel-swap-deal-with-iran-is-too-little-too-late-1.292815"> asking</a>:  “Who cares what these lowlifes agree about? If we have decided to bomb  somebody,  bomb we shall. We shall never allow the facts to confuse us.” Thomas  Friedman in  the NYT was  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/opinion/26friedman.html"> disappointed</a> that “a Holocaust-denying thug” was being allowed to live.</p>
<p>Brazenly disregarding the  agreement, the  UN Security Council approved the sanctions on June, 9. Moscow and  Beijing were  bribed or blackmailed to agree. China preferred to play ball in order to  avoid  confrontation over North Korea. The story of the sunken South Korean  ship had  provided a pretext for an attack on North Korea, and such an attack  could cause  much damage to China. The Chinese are also vulnerable to Western  meddling in Xinjiang and Tibet.</p>
<p>The Russians have received some  precious  gifts: the Ukraine was returned to Russia’s fold, Georgia was  marginalized, the  new nuclear arms treaty was better for Russia than anything they could  have  expected. At the same time, Moscow suffered a severe terrorist attack,  reminding  the Russians of their enemies’ ability to seed trouble. Notwithstanding,  Turkey  voted against the sanctions, proving its new regional role as a reliable  new  pivot for the Middle East.</p>
<p>The conflict between Turkey and  Israel  did not start with the Iran swap: it began earlier, in January 2010,  when the  Israeli deputy Foreign Minister Dani Ayalon invited the Turkish ambassador and  publicly  <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3833259,00.html"> humiliated him</a>.  In Oriental fashion, Ambassador  Chelikkol was offered  a seat  on a sofa lower the Ayalon’s  armchair. Ayalon  refused to shake hands with the ambassador and told journalists in  Hebrew while  the cameras were rolling: “We would like to show that he takes a lower  seat and  there is only the Israeli flag on the table”.</p>
<p>Or  perhaps the  conflict began  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/31/world/europe/31turkey.html"> a year earlier</a>,  in January 2009, when the Prime Minister of Turkey,  Recep  Erdogan, walked off the  stage at  the World Economic Forum in Davos. Erdogan was annoyed by the attempt of a  Western  moderator to cut off his angry response to Israeli president Shimon  Peres, who  had justified the mass killings in Gaza.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it started in  September 2007  when Israeli planes flew over Turkey to bomb Syria without as much as  ‘by your  leave’.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was even earlier,  when Turkey  began to assert its independence by discarding its century-old,  shop-worn  ideology of Kemalism. The secular  nationalism of  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk   was a trap for the former Empire. Brutish Kemalist   Turkey was necessarily a member of NATO, an enemy to Arabs and Iranians,  a  docile client of the US, a loyal ally of Israel and a persecutor of the  Kurds.</p>
<p>Now is the time to thank the  Europeans  for doing their bit to reform Turkey. In endless negotiations with  Turkey, the  European Union demanded a release of the Army’s iron grip on power.  Without this  gentle prompting from Europe, Turkey would still be ruled by a Zionist  general  or by a Zionist generals’ appointee. With their people freed from  military rule,  the Turks ended their violent secularism and regained peace with Islam  and with  their neighbours.</p>
<p>I visited Turkey last  Christmas, and met  with the activists who were about to depart for Gaza. Turkey is doing  well: no  economic crisis, steady growth, peace with the Kurds, a brave attempt to  make  peace with Armenians, and a perfect balance of religion and freedom.  Whoever  wishes to may go to a beautifully restored Ottoman mosque and pray, or  to a café  and drink very good Turkish wine. Girls are forced neither to shed their  scarves  nor to cover their arms.</p>
<p>“We lost Turkey”,  <a href="http://spectator.org/archives/2010/06/14/who-lost-turkey-not-europe/"> said</a> Robert Gates, the US Secretary of Defense, and blamed the European Union  for  refusing to accept Turkey. But we have to thank the Europeans for this  refusal.  We do not want Turkey in the EU; we need Turkey for ourselves, for the  region.</p>
<p>There is a great new plan for  creating  an Eastern Union as a regional equivalent of the European Union. This is  the  right place for Turkey, at the head of this new formation. In a way, it  will be  restoration of the Ottoman Empire &#8212; to the same extent that the  European Union  is a restoration of Charlemagne’s empire. The difference is that Europe  was  fragmented for centuries, while our region was united until 1917. Even  if full  political union is a distant prospect, this is good start on the way to  this  worthy goal.</p>
<p>There are already free-trade  treaties  between Turkey and its Arab neighbours; the spiritual dimension is  there, for  Istanbul was the last seat of the Caliphate and the see of  Constantinople  Patriarchate. Now Turkey may establish a regional International Court to  deal  with regional problems &#8212; among others, with Zionist excesses. Europe is  still  not free from Zionist control and that is why the International Court of  Justice  and International Criminal Court in The Hague are unsuitable places to  try  Zionist criminals. Moreover, their present location recalls the  Eurocentric  world of yesterday. A regional court may also convincingly deal with war   criminals in occupied Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries. Great  lawyers  like Richard Falk and Judge Goldstone could be invited to sit in it.</p>
<p>The establishment of the  International  Court (East) would be a serious and realistic step towards further  decolonization of the region and its future unification in an Eastern  Union.</p>
<p>However, the Eastern Union will  be as  different from the Ottoman Empire as the European Union differs from the  Third  Reich, that previous attempt to unite Europe. It will be a voluntary  union of  sovereign states, where they all will preserve their unique cultures and   traditions, a good neighbour to united Europe, to Russia, Iran and  China.</p>
<p><strong>Looking beyond the Middle  East</strong></p>
<p>The Union could peacefully  spread well  beyond the Middle East as well, reuniting its natural territories from  Gibraltar  to Danube. This natural territory was formed a long time ago, in the  fourth  century, when the mighty Roman Empire was divided into the Western  Empire with  its capital in Rome, and the Eastern Empire, or Byzantium, with its  capital in  Constantinople, as Istanbul was then called. The Byzantine Empire became  the  Ottoman Empire in 1456. Still, it is the same ‘great space’, the same  united  large civilization of Muslims and Eastern Christians. People of Turkey  and  Greece, Serbia and Egypt have the same attitudes, they share their  common  values, they are more religious than their Western brethren, they object  to the  Western colonization, American imperialism and Israeli Zionism.</p>
<p>The rising West could not  vanquish the  united East; so in order to colonize its lands, the West has tempted the  nations  with a futile dream of independence. This mirage of independence was but  a trap:  the new “liberated independent” countries became subjects of Western  rule. We  may compare that with a human body: if our arms and legs will become  independent  of our mind, they won’t manage well. Indeed all members of the single  body, the  Ottoman Empire, do not function well after the amputation, or  independence,  forced upon them.</p>
<p>That was the case with the  Arabs during  World War I. The Arab Revolt was brought forth by Lawrence of Arabia, a  great  agent of British intelligence. The Arab lands became much more dependent  than  they ever were, and now they are ruled by a plethora of sheiks, stooges  and  dictators. The only democratic regime in the whole Arab world is  unhappy,  besieged Gaza.</p>
<p>However, the Arabs were not the  only  victims of these Western policies. The British intrigues had caused  Greece’s  independence in early 19<sup>th</sup> century, and afterwards rivers of  blood  and transfers had made this separation complete. But Greece is not at  home in  the EU, just as Greece of old was not at home in the Empire ruled from  Rome. The  recent financial crisis has proven it again: Greece’s roots and destiny  are in  the East.</p>
<p>No sane person would suggest  that Greece  should be incorporated in Turkey. Equally, none would suggest France be  incorporated in Germany. However, France joined Germany to form the EU,  and  Greece may join Turkey to create the Eastern Union, eventually to  embrace other  Muslim and Orthodox Balkan provinces of the Byzantines, namely Albania  and  Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, even Romania and Georgia. All these  countries  may find the Eastern Union more suitable than the European one.</p>
<p>The Eastern Union may reach  other  countries and former provinces that were torn away and colonized by the  Europeans in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Algeria is a country that  needs this  reconnection most of all, as this oil-rich land is run by a bunch of  secular  anti-religious and pro-Western generals just like Turkey was until ten  years  ago. Morocco with its outdated and unsuccessful monarchy that combines  systematic torture of dissidents with abject Zionism, maverick Libya and  fragile  Tunis also need a broader framework which would not cancel out but  instead  reinforce their sovereignty.</p>
<p>The Eastern Union could also  establish  an area of joint interests with the Russians over the Caucasus. Russians  have a  problem over there: separation of these Russian provinces is too  dangerous as it  is likely to bring the hostile forces of NATO into Russia’s backyard.  Keeping  them against the population’s will is an expensive and unpopular policy.  A  Russian attempt to grant independence in all but name to Chechnya  misfired as  the small country immediately turned its territory into a base of armed  raids  into Russia proper. The Eastern Union could put paid to these  insurgencies and  bring peace and stability to the turbulent Caucasus. In return, the  Union may  recognize Russian interests in the Christian Orthodox sites.</p>
<p>Palestine will become a crown  jewel of  the Eastern Union. Demise of colonialism will end Zionism as well, for  after  all, Zionism would never win ground without European imperialist  support. The  Christians, Jews and Muslims of Palestine will have equal rights and  duties in  the Holy Land, forever free from political ambitions and ethnic rivalry.</p>
