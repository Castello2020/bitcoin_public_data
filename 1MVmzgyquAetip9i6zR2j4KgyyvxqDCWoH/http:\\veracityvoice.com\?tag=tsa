			<p>Imagine the following scenario.</p>
<p>It is mid-afternoon on the Wednesday just before Thanksgiving. Some jerk walks into the Atlanta airport, gets his boarding pass and makes his way to the mini-North Korea known as TSA. He hands the blueshirt his boarding pass and driver’s license. He then reaches into his carry-on bag, presses a button and – <strong>KABOOOOOOM!!!!!!</strong> – kills 2000 people.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5112" src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tsa-lines.jpg" alt="tsa-lines" width="300" height="195" />At the same moment, two other jerks are doing the exact same thing at O’Hare and DFW as part of a co-ordinated attack. And not only have more people just died than died on 9/11, but America’s three largest aviation hubs have just experienced massive destruction and air travel everywhere has been severely interrupted.</p>
<p>TSA could not prevent this, just like they could not prevent the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Los_Angeles_International_Airport_shooting" target="_blank">fatal shooting of a TSA agent at LAX</a> last year. Terrorism need not happen at 35,000 feet. Indeed, extremely few terror attacks have anything to do with aviation.</p>
<p>TSA <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2012/07/14/tsa-does-not-keep-you-safe-it-never-has-it-never-will/" target="_blank">does not keep you safe</a>. Period.</p>
<p>However, the American people persist in the notion that it does. And they will tolerate endless violations of their civil liberties and physical bodies in the name of <em>Schutz und Sicherheit.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5115" src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/patriot-act.jpg" alt="patriot act" />It all started shortly after 9/11 with the passing of the <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/02/27/the-patriot-act-is-not-patriotic/" target="_blank">Patriot Act</a>, which ushered in numerous violations on our Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful search and seizure. And most people supported it because, after all, we had to “go after the terrorists.” And, hey, we had to give up our liberty for a time until the crisis passed.</p>
<p>I have to confess that I acquiesced in this for a very short time. I, like so many millions of others, was caught up in the passions of the moment.</p>
<p>But then I started asking: now that the camel’s nose is under the tent, what else are they going to do? And, more importantly, how much more will the American people accept?</p>
<p>It appears that there is no limit here.</p>
<p>Will we routinely accept the violation of our physical bodies in the name of safety and security? It turns out that we have.</p>
<p>Just consider the passivity with which most people accept “porn, perversion and pedophilia” – I wish I knew who said that first – in the name of “transportation safety”. When you look at a nude photograph of a minor, it is child pornography. If someone else feels you up without your consent, it is sexual assault. (And if anyone did this to me under any other circumstances, it would take about one nanosecond for me to put the wretched little pervert’s teeth on the ground.)</p>
<p>The Nazis didn’t do it. No communist regime ever did it. Yet, in the “land of the free”, being felt up in order to prove one’s innocence is now a condition of travel.</p>
<p>And just look at these tax-mainlining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4pQniAoeX4&amp;feature=kp" target="_blank">Uncle Ernies</a>.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5113" src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tsa-kids-6-pics.jpg" alt="tsa kids 6 pics" width="586" height="426" /></p>
</div>
<p>And if you will let the authorities photograph you naked and feel you up, why wouldn’t you let them violate you even further?</p>
<p>Would you let them catheterize you, like these <a href="http://fox13now.com/2012/05/24/man-sues-police-over-forced-catheterization/#ooid=t4NmN0NDrX2pw86ZXZY0USvnmkIWZxXg" target="_blank">central Utah</a> police did when looking for marijuana?</p>
<p>Would you let them draw your blood? Read what is happening in <a href="http://benswann.com/police-planning-4th-of-july-no-refusal-blood-draw-dui-checkpoints/" target="_blank">Tennessee, Texas and Oregon</a>.</p>
<p>Would you submit to cavity searches, such as those performed in <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/29/judge-hands-down-unbelievably-lenient-sentence-for-cop-who-fingered-suspects-anuses/" target="_blank">Milwaukee</a> and in <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cops-probed-n-m-man-anus-8-times-traffic-stop-job-report-article-1.1815078" target="_blank">Deming, New Mexico</a>?</p>
<p>Would you let them slit your throat and kill you? Police did just this on a drug bust in <a href="http://appalachianareanews.com/teen-dead-after-alabama-police-cut-throat-open-to-retrieve-drugs/" target="_blank">Huntsville, Alabama</a>. And just as TSA has never caught a terrorist, the cops in this case found no drugs.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-5116 size-medium" src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/drugs-terror.jpg" alt="drugs terror" width="241" height="285" /><em>“But …… but …… but, they were looking for terrorists and drugs.”</em></p>
<p>The wars on drugs and terror are just like any other type of federal overreach. Both come clothed in somebody’s good intention. Both are sold to us in the name of some Higher Good. They always grow bigger and uglier with time. And they always create bigger problems than those they were intended to solve.</p>
<p>Do you want to live in a society when the authorities can invade your body at will and with impunity? Do you want to live in a society where you are constantly required to prove your innocence? A government that will force you to prove your innocence is infinitely more dangerous than any drug or terrorist.</p>
<p>Even more dangerous is a populace that feels protected by such a government. Obama is too good for such a people.</p>

<p>Neil Young is a Canadian singer, songwriter, guitarist and author of <em><a href="http://www.neilyoung.com/tablet/wagingpage.html">WAGING HEAVY PEACE</a></em></p>
<p>Crazy Horse is an American band best known for their association with Young beginning in 1969.</p>
<p>Crazy Horse has been co-credited on 11 studio albums and numerous live albums billed as by “Neil Young and Crazy Horse”.</p>
<p>In <em>Waging Heavy Peace</em>, Neil Young’s 2012 autobiography, Young documents his life and career shifting from the past to present and from career to personal experiences.</p>
<p>On page 346, Neil Young wrote:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555555;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>Somewhere along the line I had suggested the name Crazy Horse after the great Indian chief and the guys liked it. Neil Young with Crazy Horse. Not ‘and’…I liked that I was with them. Like we were together, not separate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On page 137, Neil Young wrote:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555555;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>When music is your life, there is a key that gets you to the core. I am so grateful that I still have Crazy Horse…they are my window to the cosmic world where the music lives and breathes. I can find myself there and go to the special area of my soul…</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>Just getting there is the key thing, and Crazy Horse is my way of getting there…</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>Am I too cosmic about this? I think not…</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>Do not doubt me in my sincerity, for it is that which has brought us to each other now.</strong></p>

<h3 style="font-weight: inherit;">In 2005, a coalition of over 170 Palestinian civil society organizations launched a <a href="http://pacbi.org/etemplate.php?id=66">campaign calling the international community to boycott Israel culturally, academically, and commercially </a> UNTIL Israel recognizes the indigenous Palestinian people’s right to self-determination, UNTIL Israel fully complies with international law and finally honors the <a href="http://wearewideawake.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=1">UNIVERSAL DECLARATION of HUMAN RIGHTS </a>upon which the Establishment of their very Statehood was contingent upon!</h3>

<p><strong>In November 2006, Father Manuel, the parish Priest at the Latin Church and school in Gaza warned the world:</strong></p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #555555;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>Gaza cannot sleep! The people are suffering unbelievably. They are hungry, thirsty, have no electricity or clean water. They are suffering constant bombardments and sonic booms from low flying aircraft. They need food: bread and water. Children and babies are hungry…people have no money to buy food. The price of food has doubled and tripled due to the situation. We cannot drink water from the ground here as it is salty and not hygienic. People must buy water to drink. They have no income, no opportunities to get food and water from outside and no opportunities to secure money inside of Gaza. They have no hope.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>Without electricity children are afraid. No light at night. No oil or candles…Thirsty children are crying, afraid and desperate…Many children have been violently thrown from their beds at night from the sonic booms. Many arms and legs have been broken. These planes fly low over Gaza and then reach the speed of sound. This shakes the ground and creates shock waves like an earthquake that causes people to be thrown from their bed. I, myself weigh 120 kilos and was almost thrown from my bed due to the shock wave produced by a low flying jet that made a sonic boom.</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: inherit;"><strong>Gaza cannot sleep…the cries of hungry children, the sullen faces of broken men and women who are just sitting in their hungry emptiness with no light, no hope, no love. These actions are War Crimes!</strong></p>

<p>Because this American cannot improve on this Letter to Neil Young from the Palestinian Students’ Campaign for the Academic Boycott of Israel University Teachers’ Association it follows in full here:</p>
<p>16.03.2014</p>
<p>Besieged Gaza, Palestine</p>
<p>Dear Neil</p>
<p>We are Palestinian students and youth from the besieged Gaza Strip; we write to you now on a night engulfed by huge explosions ripping through our houses and neighborhoods again, more common than the thunder and hard rain also filling the night air.</p>
<p>And now we hear you plan on playing your inspiring music to a packed house in Hayarkon Park, Tel Aviv, a park built on the ruins of the Palestinian village Al Mirr, a land and people, destroyed and buried amidst unspeakable violence, but not forgotten. The residents of that Palestinian village and hundreds of other villages forcibly emptied by the nascent Israeli army, were either killed or denied return, denied the chance to even visit or commemorate the lives they once had. <sup>(1)</sup></p>
<p>While the world turns its back, we hope that you don’t turn yours, that you heed the call of over 170 Palestinian civil society organizations, for boycott, divestment and sanctions against the Israeli regime until it abides by international law and stops denying us the right to live as any other human beings would expect.</p>
<p>Just as you didn’t perform in Apartheid South Africa, just as you stood up against racism in the US South, just as you have so admirably supported indigenous rights in Canada against the drilling for Tar Sands, we ask you to support indigenous, displaced people wherever they may be, including we Palestinians. The words of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association in their recent move to boycott the Israeli regime echo the struggle for indigenous rights in America. <sup>(2)</sup></p>
<p>As this letter is penned the sound of more Israeli bombing reverberates around the tight refugee camps and narrow alleys where we live.</p>
<p>The camps are in complete darkness as the electricity has been cut.</p>
<p>The Israeli siege and previous bombing of our only power-plant has lead to huge fuel shortages, leaving us with just 6 hours of electricity each day.</p>
<p>This is just one night, but it is comparable to many other nights in Gaza, many worse nights.</p>
<p>We are used to facing the wrath of Israeli Merkhava tanks, drones, shellings, bombs and snipers that have brutally murdered and maimed our people for decades, for the crime of being born Palestinians, the wrong “ethnic group” for the Israeli regime who since it was established has done everything to wipe us off the map.</p>
<p>Listening to music is difficult in these circumstances, despite our passion for it. We have our own big range of music we love to play and Debka dance. But we have few instruments. Israel’s air, land and sea blockade of all our borders has meant for years musical instruments were banned from entry to Gaza.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>Other items denied to us were coriander, nutmeg, ginger, dried fruit, fresh meat, lentils, pasta, chocolate, fishing rods, cattle, toys, donkey, workbooks and newspapers. Dov Weisglass, an advisor to former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, explicitly outlined their intentions to collectively punish our population, “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger”, he announced, in contravention of article 33 of the Geneva Conventions and condemned by all major human rights organizations. <sup>(4]</sup></p>
<p>The violence behind Israel’s military occupation of our land is relentless and this week is no different. It began with Israeli border police shooting and killing a 38 year old Palestinian judge Raed Zeitar, the other bus passengers forced to sit and watch as he bled to death. Then 18-year-old Saji Darwish, Humanities student at Birzeit university, was shot in the head in Beitin, near Ramallah. Thousands attended his funeral the following day.</p>
<p>Tuesday saw four more murdered in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Israeli authorities approved the construction of 387 housing units in the illegal settlement of Ramat Shlomo, denying the Palestinian towns of Beit Hanina and Shuafat the possibility to expand. And today a three-month old baby Ahmed Ammar Abu Nahal died of enlarged heart and liver as a result of the closure of Gaza crossings, a closure that has also left our hospitals bereft of medical supplies.</p>
<p>And right now we sit paralyzed in our homes as the bombs fall on us in Gaza.</p>
<p>Who knows when the current attacks will end.</p>
<p>Permanently etched on our minds are the rivers of blood that ran through the Gaza streets when for over 3 weeks in 2009 over 1400 were killed including over 330 children, with white phosphorous and other chemical weapons used in civilian areas and contaminating our land with a rise in cancers as a result.</p>
<p>More recently 170 more were killed in the weeklong attacks in late November 2012.</p>
<p>How many more sleeping in their beds now will face the same fate in the coming days, weeks and months? The trauma, fear and uncertainty never goes away.</p>
<p>Over two thirds of the Palestinians here in Gaza are UN registered refugees.</p>
<p>Over half of us are children.</p>
<p>We or our descendants were dispossessed entirely and forcibly removed from our homes.</p>
<p>The extent of this ethnic cleansing was such that one in three refugees worldwide is a Palestinian.</p>
<p>Expulsions of Palestinians continue today especially in Jerusalem and the West Bank, places that we in Gaza are no longer able to visit.</p>
<p>For what crime? The crime of being born Palestinian.</p>
<p>The Israeli regime denies us the freedom to come to enjoy your music, we live our lives surrounded by Navy Gunships along the sea, jeeps and wall tower snipers along the land frontier, and skies filled with the kind of aircraft unleashing yet more devastating attacks tonight.</p>
<p>The Gaza Strip has been made an outdoor prison, a reality beyond which most youth can never imagine, because most can never leave.</p>
<p>Others are hearing us and the world is beginning to wake up.</p>
<p>Many of your contemporaries are taking a stand including Carlos Santana, Roger Waters, Annie Lennox, Elvis Costello and the late, great Pete Seeger and Gil Scott Heron, who said he wouldn’t play in Israel “until everyone is welcome there”. <sup>(5)</sup></p>
<p>As Israeli Apartheid week kicked off in South Africa this week, an event that has taken place in over 150 different locations worldwide, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for the world to support the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions of Israel, just as many other Anti Apartheid heroes from South Africa have affirmed. Tutu said in his statement on Monday, “I have witnessed the systemic humiliation of Palestinian men, women and children by members of the Israeli security forces. Their humiliation is familiar to all black South Africans who were corralled and harassed and insulted and assaulted by the security forces of the apartheid government.” <sup>(6)</sup></p>
<p>Long before he died, Nelson Mandela demanded that we should have the self determination of any other people. “We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians”, he said.</p>
<p>Will you sing “living with war” to an audience most of which will have served or are serving in the Israeli army that during the day were bombing our families, or manning the hundreds of checkpoints that make simple journeys daily acts of humiliation?</p>
<p>While we in Gaza can never return to our homes that lay buried around the areas in which you will be travelling freely, will you sing, “A hundred voices from a hundred lands, need someone to listen.  People are dying here and there.”</p>
<p>On the struggle to support First Nations rights in Canada and environmental protection <strong>you said: “If you have a conscience, you can`t go through your day without realizing what`s going on, and questioning it, and going, “Is this right?”</strong><sup>(7)</sup></p>
<p>This is the question to mull over as here in Gaza a short period of silence has descended after the bombs rained down on us yet again tonight Show the courage to say that this system of violent discrimination and racial segregation is unacceptable in Palestine, just as you showed it to be unacceptable in the American South, unacceptable in Apartheid South Africa and unacceptable for the Indigenous of the Americas.</p>
<p>Stand on the right side of history and stand with us, and don’t entertain apartheid Israel this July.</p>

			<p><strong>What The DHS Is Building Is Indeed A Beast&#8230;</strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/Dept-of-Homeland-Security3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>One of the great concerns of our Founding Fathers was a large standing army on American soil. James Madison spoke for all of America’s founders when he said, “A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty.” I wonder what Madison and the rest of our founders would have to say about the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>
<p>John Whitehead, the president of The Rutherford Institute, recently wrote a trenchant summary of the DHS. He began by saying, “If the United States is a police state, then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is its national police force, with all the brutality, ineptitude and corruption such a role implies. In fact, although the DHS’ governmental bureaucracy may at times appear to be inept and bungling, it is ruthlessly efficient when it comes to building what the Founders feared most&#8211;a standing army on American soil.”</p>
<p>Whitehead observes that the DHS employs over 240,000 full time workers and has an annual budget of $61 billion. Sub-agencies of the DHS include the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</p>
<p>Whitehead states, “In the 12 years since it was established to ‘prevent terrorist attacks within the United States,’ the DHS has grown from a post-9/11 knee-jerk reaction to a leviathan with tentacles in every aspect of American life. With good reason, a bipartisan bill to provide greater oversight and accountability into the DHS’ purchasing process has been making its way through Congress.</p>
<p>“A better plan would be to abolish the DHS altogether. In making the case for shutting down the de facto national police agency, analyst Charles Kenny offers the following six reasons: one, the agency lacks leadership; two, terrorism is far less of a threat than it is made out to be; three, the FBI has actually stopped more alleged terrorist attacks than DHS; four, the agency wastes exorbitant amounts of money with little to show for it; five, ‘An overweight DHS gets a free pass to infringe civil liberties without a shred of economic justification’; and six, the agency is just plain bloated.”</p>
<p>In addition to Kenny’s reasons for shutting down the DHS, Whitehead adds the following indictments:</p>
<p>“Militarizing police and SWAT teams. The DHS routinely hands out six-figure grants to enable local municipalities to purchase military-style vehicles, as well as a veritable war chest of weaponry, ranging from tactical vests, bomb-disarming robots, assault weapons and combat uniforms. This rise in military equipment purchases funded by the DHS has, according to analysts Andrew Becker and G.W. Schulz, ‘paralleled an apparent increase in local SWAT teams.’ The end result? An explosive growth in the use of SWAT teams for otherwise routine police matters, an increased tendency on the part of police to shoot first and ask questions later, and an overall mindset within police forces that they are at war&#8211;and the citizenry are the enemy combatants.</p>
<p>“Stockpiling ammunition. DHS, along with other government agencies, has been stockpiling an alarming amount of ammunition in recent years, which only adds to the discomfort of those already leery of the government. As of 2013, DHS had 260 million rounds of ammo in stock, which averages out to between 1,300 to 1,600 rounds per officer. The US Army, in contrast, has roughly 350 rounds per soldier. DHS has since requisitioned more than 1.6 billion rounds of ammo, ‘enough,’ concludes Forbes magazine, ‘to sustain a hot war for 20+ years.’</p>
<p>“Distributing license plate readers. DHS has already distributed more than $50 million in grants to enable local police agencies to acquire license plate readers, which rely on mobile cameras to photograph and identify cars, match them against a national database, and track their movements. Relying on private contractors to maintain a license plate database allows the DHS and its affiliates to access millions of records without much in the way of oversight.</p>
<p>“Contracting to build detention camps. In 2006, DHS awarded a $385 million contract to a Halliburton subsidiary to build detention centers on American soil. Although the government and Halliburton were not forthcoming about where or when these domestic detention centers would be built, they rationalized the need for them in case of ‘an emergency influx of immigrants, or to support the rapid development of new programs’ in the event of other emergencies such as ‘natural disasters.’ Viewed in conjunction with the NDAA provision allowing the military to arrest and indefinitely detain anyone, including American citizens, it would seem the building blocks are already in place for such an eventuality.</p>
<p>“Tracking cell-phones with Stingray devices. Distributed to local police agencies as a result of grants from the DHS, these Stingray devices enable police to track individuals’ cell phones&#8211;and their owners&#8211;without a court warrant or court order. The amount of information conveyed by these devices about one’s activities, whereabouts and interactions is considerable. As one attorney explained: ‘Because we carry our cellphones with us virtually everywhere we go, stingrays can paint a precise picture of where we are and who we spend time with, including our location in a lover’s house, in a psychologist’s office or at a political protest.’</p>
<p>“Carrying out military drills and lockdowns in American cities. Each year, DHS funds military-style training drills in cities across the country. These Urban Shield exercises, elaborately staged with their own set of professionally trained Crisis Actors playing the parts of shooters, bystanders and victims, fool law enforcement officials, students, teachers, bystanders and the media into thinking it’s a real crisis.</p>
<p>“Using the TSA as an advance guard. The TSA now searches a variety of government and private databases, including things like car registrations and employment information, in order to track travelers’ before they ever get near an airport. Other information collected includes ‘tax identification number, past travel itineraries, property records, physical characteristics, and law enforcement or intelligence information.’</p>
<p>“Conducting virtual strip searches with full-body scanners. Under the direction of the TSA, American travelers have been subjected to all manner of searches ranging from whole-body scanners and enhanced patdowns at airports to bag searches in train stations. In response to public outrage over what amounted to a virtual strip search, the TSA has begun replacing the scanners with equally costly yet less detailed models. The old scanners will be used by prisons for now.</p>
<p>“Carrying out soft target checkpoints. VIPR task forces, comprised of federal air marshals, surface transportation security inspectors, transportation security officers, behavior detection officers and explosive detection canine teams have laid the groundwork for the government’s effort to secure so-called ‘soft’ targets such as malls, stadiums, bridges, etc. Some security experts predict that checkpoints and screening stations will eventually be established at all soft targets, such as department stores, restaurants, and schools. DHS’ Operation Shield, a program which seeks to check up on security protocols around the country with unannounced visits, conducted a surprise security exercise at the Social Security Administration building in Leesburg, Fla., when they subjected people who went to pick up their checks to random ID checks by federal agents armed with semi-automatic weapons.</p>
<p>“Directing government workers to spy on Americans. Terrorism Liaison Officers are firefighters, police officers, and even corporate employees who have received training to spy on and report back to government entities on the day-to-day activities of their fellow citizens. These individuals are authorized to report ‘suspicious activity’ which can include such innocuous activities as taking pictures with no apparent aesthetic value, making measurements and drawings, taking notes, conversing in code, espousing radical beliefs, and buying items in bulk.</p>
<p>“Conducting widespread spying networks using fusion centers. Data collecting agencies spread throughout the country, aided by the National Security Agency, fusions centers&#8211;of which there are at least 78 scattered around the U.S.&#8211;constantly monitor our communications, collecting and cataloguing everything from our internet activity and web searches to text messages, phone calls and emails. This data is then fed to government agencies, which are now interconnected: the CIA to the FBI, the FBI to local police. Despite a budget estimated to be somewhere between $289 million and $1.4 billion, these fusion centers have proven to be exercises in incompetence, often producing irrelevant, useless or inappropriate intelligence, while spending millions of dollars on ‘flat-screen televisions, sport utility vehicles, hidden cameras and other gadgets.’”</p>
<p>On a personal note, I can testify to Whitehead’s warning regarding fusion centers. When I ran as the Constitution Party’s candidate for President back in 2008, DHS fusion centers funneled warnings to the State of Missouri law enforcement agencies to be on the look-out for people sporting bumper stickers with my name, Ron Paul’s name, and Bob Barr’s (the Libertarian Party candidate for President that same year) name. People with these bumper stickers were said to be “potential dangerous militia members,” “extremists,” etc.</p>
<p>When word of this blatant violation of fundamental liberties publicly surfaced, tens of thousands of outraged Americans inundated the political offices within the State of Missouri. Ron, Bob, and I sent a letter to the governor and MIAC officer in charge demanding an apology and that the statements be removed from Missouri law enforcement memos. Public pressure was so massive that it didn’t take long for Missouri officials to apologize to us and remove the libelous statements. However, if you think this kind of conduct is not continuing, you are very mistaken.</p>
<p>I have had several liberty-minded law enforcement officers (in several states) personally show me interoffice memos and computer reports depicting me (and several other liberty-minded public figures) as “extremists,” “radicals,” “hate-group leaders,” etc. Virtually, every such memo or report is being distributed to local police departments and sheriff’s offices via DHS fusion centers&#8211;in concert with the ultra-liberal Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).</p>
<p>Whitehead continues:</p>
<p>“Carrying out Constitution-free border control searches. On orders from the DHS, the government’s efforts along the border have become little more than an exercise in police state power, ranging from aggressive checkpoints to the widespread use of drone technology, often used against American citizens traveling within the country. Border patrol operations occur within 100 miles of an international crossing, putting some 200 million Americans within the bounds of aggressive border patrol searches and seizures, as well as increasingly expansive drone surveillance. With 71 checkpoints found along the southwest border of the United States alone, suspicionless search and seizures on the border are rampant. Border patrol agents also search the personal electronic devices of people crossing the border without a warrant.</p>
<p>“Funding city-wide surveillance cameras. As Charlie Savage reports for the Boston Globe, the DHS has funneled ‘millions of dollars to local governments nationwide for purchasing high-tech video camera networks, accelerating the rise of a “surveillance society” in which the sense of freedom that stems from being anonymous in public will be lost.’ These camera systems, installed on city streets, in parks and transit systems, operating in conjunction with sophisticated computer systems that boast intelligent video analytics, digital biometric identification, military-pedigree software for analyzing and predicting crime and facial recognition software, create a vast surveillance network that can target millions of innocent individuals.</p>
<p>“Utilizing drones and other spybots. The DHS has been at the forefront of funding and deploying surveillance robots and drones for land, sea and air, including robots that resemble fish and tunnel-bots that can travel underground. Despite repeated concerns over the danger surveillance drones used domestically pose to Americans’ privacy rights, the DHS has continued to expand its fleet of Predator drones, which come equipped with video cameras, infrared cameras, heat sensors, and radar. DHS also loans its drones out to local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies for a variety of tasks, although the agency refuses to divulge any details as to how, why and in what capacity these drones are being used by police. Incredibly, the DHS has also been handing out millions of dollars in grants to local police agencies to ‘accelerate the adoption’ of drones in their localities.”</p>
<p>Whitehead concludes by saying, “It’s not difficult to see why the DHS has been described as a ‘wasteful, growing, fear-mongering beast.’ If it is a beast, however, it is a beast that is accelerating our nation’s transformation into a police state through its establishment of a standing army, a.k.a. national police force.”</p>

<p>When the British government employed such tactics (in their own way, given the lack of technology in the mid-1700s), the pulpits of Colonial America thundered forth the call of liberty. Presbyterians, Baptists, Congregationalists, Separatists, Anglicans: it didn’t matter. Pastors from across the denominational spectrum boldly and courageously implored their congregants to resist these tyrannical tactics. And resist they did!</p>
<p>So, what are our pastors and churches doing today in the face of this burgeoning police state? For the most part, they are sitting back mute and dumb. If they are not absolutely apathetic to the rise of this beast, they are actually assisting it. Through the egregiously unbiblical interpretation of Romans 13, whereby pastors are telling their adherents to submit to evil government, or through the fear of losing their precious 501c3 tax-exempt status, pastors are deliberately leading their churches as sheep to the slaughter.</p>
<p>And make no mistake about it: what the DHS is building is indeed a BEAST. And prophecy buffs should be well-acquainted with that word. Does not the Scripture warn us that there are “many” anti-Christs in the world? Is not the word “beast” and “anti-Christ” synonymous? They absolutely are. Prophecy students are also well aware of the fact that the prophetic “beast” is as much a system as it is a person. Without a doubt, this beastly system is being constructed before our very eyes.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this beast was created by the professing Christian president, G.W. Bush. Is that why Christian pastors are so complacent? Are they truly that gullible? A “conservative” Republican creates the beast, and a “liberal” Democrat feeds it. Both are equally culpable.</p>
<p>These pastors can talk about following Jesus all they want; they can cry crocodile tears when they sing Amazing Grace all they want; they can preach about Heaven all they want; and they can talk about being “born again” all they want. But if they are not warning their people about this growing beast, and if they are not emphatically imploring their people to resist this beast, they are helping to feed their sheep to the wolves.</p>
<p>Dear Christian friends, get out of these churches! As nice as the pastor seems to be, as sincere as he seems to be, as doctrinally-sound as he appears to be, by his refusal to resist this growing police state he is helping to put the chains of slavery around the necks of your children and grandchildren. He is facilitating the rise of a very dangerous and hungry beast in our land.</p>
<p>Real men of God throughout history have been noted by their courage to resist the evil beasts that have attempted to devour God’s people. From Gideon and Samson to Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli, and from Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemoller to Jonas Clark and James Caldwell, these men of God were indefatigable and heroic champions of liberty.</p>
<p>The “standing military force” and “overgrown Executive” are here! Now, where are the patriot pulpits to resist them?</p>

<p><em><strong>&#8220;Stand your ground.  Don&#8217;t fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.&#8221;</strong></em> - Militia Captain John Parker at the Battle Of Lexington</p>
<p>Just a couple days ago, two armed assailants, a married couple purported by the mainstream media to be “white supremacists” and “conspiracy theorists,” <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/06/08/2-police-officers-shot-in-las-vegas/" target="_blank">ambushed two police officers</a> at a CiCi’s Pizza in Las Vegas, killing the officers after screaming, “This is a revolution!” The suspects then reportedly covered one officer’s body with a Gadsden Don’t Tread On Me flag and then fled to a Walmart, where they killed another man with a CCW who attempted to reason with them, then committed suicide. Yes, it reads like a Southern Poverty Law Center fantasy story; and in many ways, it is.</p>
<p>As we all predicted the MSM has followed the pattern they have always followed, which is to equate the actions of one or two psychotics with the beliefs and principles of the liberty movement in general.</p>
<p>I remember when Jared Loughner fired into a crowd of people near Tucson, Ariz., killing numerous Federal and State employees; the immediate response by the media was to attempt to tie him to the liberty movement. In the end, he turned out to be a raving leftist. I remember the Boston Marathon bombing and the automatic reflex by the media to accuse “right-wing extremists” of the crime. So far, we have seen NO hard evidence to implicate anyone specific in that atrocity, including the Tsarnaev brothers. Of all the violent crimes dumped in the lap of the liberty movement over the years, how many have actually been committed or endorsed by the liberty movement? I can’t think of any.</p>
<p>This has not prevented the establishment media from doing everything in their power to associate criminal action with political ideals.  Efforts to sully the success of the Bundy Ranch stand-off were swift, with Jared and Amanda Miller&#8217;s visit to Bunkerville splashed across the headlines.  Luckily, the sound judgement of organizations like Oath Keepers led founder Stewart Rhodes to personally ask the two future shooters to leave the property.  I can only imagine the weight of the slander if they had been allowed to stay.</p>
<p>When an activist movement holds the moral high ground against a repressive establishment power structure, the establishment’s primary recourse is to target the character of its principles. The secondary recourse is direct confrontation. If a dissenting organization is not mindlessly vicious in its methods, then simply make it APPEAR vicious. If it is not hateful in its rhetoric, then artificially tie it to people who are. And if a government really needs to kick-start a crackdown, it can engineer its own man-made calamities and blame the groups that most threaten its authority.</p>
<p>This was achieved to great effect in Europe from the 1950s until the 1990s by the CIA working in tandem with multiple European governments under a covert project called Operation Gladio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gladio was essentially a secret army of operatives and stooges, handlers and puppets, used to create false-flag terrorist shootings and bombings across Europe that were blamed on “left-wing extremists.” In reality, NATO alphabet agencies were behind the entire facade. The goal was to terrorize the citizenry through a nonstop campaign of indiscriminate death, blamed on a convenient scapegoat, so that individuals would hand over more freedom and more power to the central governments. The point is, whether real or staged, I believe such events are going to escalate within the U.S. today on an incredible scale and that, regardless of evidence, they will be blamed on “right-wing extremists.” In case you were wondering, that label will be foisted on most if not all of us.</p>
<p>That said, I think an important truth needs to be stated here: Whether the beliefs of the attackers in Las Vegas were actually liberty movement-oriented or not is ultimately irrelevant. To shoot random police and civilians and then commit suicide is an act of pure insanity, a product of mental instability that has nothing to do with political philosophy, and mental instability trumps belief and association anytime.  Mentally unstable people exist within ALL belief systems and political groups.</p>
<p>At bottom, I do not care what their beliefs were. Their actions do not represent the values I hold dear, nor do I think they represent the values most of us hold dear. The shooting is a tragedy, but in the grand scheme of things, it means nothing, and I have little doubt it will be forgotten within weeks.</p>
<p>I relate the story because I do, in fact, agree with one thing: that a “revolution,” a second American Revolution, is inevitable. But I think I speak for the vast majority of the movement when I say that this revolution will not begin with the deaths of innocents or random government employees on our hands, and it certainly won’t begin at the doorstep of a CiCi’s Pizza.</p>
<p>The Bundy ranch incident, which occurred only a short drive from Las Vegas, has been a revelation for many people. Mistakes were made, provocateurs reared their ugly heads, and lessons were learned. But overall, America has been fundamentally changed, even if the average person does not realize it yet. The information war came within a razor’s edge of evolving into a shooting war, with the establishment in retreat, licking its wounds while planning how it can gain back its composure and carefully crafted image of &#8220;invincibility&#8221;.</p>
<p>What frightens the establishment most, I think, is that the American people have become active participants in their own national environment once again. At Bundy ranch, they stopped asking for mercy, they stopped begging the system to police itself, they stopped waiting for the rigged elections, and they stopped relying on useless legal avenues to effect change. Rather, they took matters into their own hands and changed the situation on the ground on their own. For oligarchy, this development is unacceptable, because one success could lead to many.</p>
<p>Already, we are beginning to hear whispers of possible <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.8newsnow.com/story/25469579/breaking-news-fbi-investigating-bundy-supporters-in-blm-dispute" target="_blank">Federal retribution</a> against those who participated in the confrontation.</p>
<p>This has been cemented within the efforts of a new task force against <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/attorney-general-eric-holder-revives-domestic-terror-task-force-n121026" target="_blank">“domestic terrorism</a>” organized by none other than Eric “Fast and Furious” Holder.</p>
<p>After the recent exposure of Barack Obama’s Department of Defense Directive 3025.18, we now know that since at least 2010, the White House has been setting the stage for the use of military force against “domestic threats.” That is to say, for at least the past four years our government has been quietly maneuvering toward martial law. It’s been happening for much longer if you count George W. Bush’s <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/28/inside-the-ring-directive-outlines-obamas-policy-t/" target="_blank">Presidential Decision Directive 51</a>, which has yet to be<a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-51.htm" target="_blank">fully declassified</a>.</p>
<p>The exposure of Directive 3025.18 also came with information that the Obama Administration considered using it as a way to activate military forces and drones against the Bundy ranch. The burning question is, of course, why didn’t it? The Federal government is not known for its diplomacy in the face of a defiant citizenry. Waco and Ruby Ridge made that clear. I believe that it was not necessarily the people on the ground at Bunkerville, Nev., that they were most worried about. The terrain is admittedly a terrible place to mount a defense against a mechanized horde of jackboots.</p>
<p>No, what the White House feared was a larger response to such an attack. It feared the millions of patriots who would swarm down from all sides if it committed to a Ruby Ridge-style siege. It feared the reality that this time, Americans were not going to sit back and watch another family be slaughtered on national television.  It feared the fact that it didn’t have the moral high ground in the public eye and that a kinetic failure on its part would be met with cheers, rather than tears, from much of the populace.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us? With the Bundy success besmirching the Feds, the next strategic program will likely include an unprecedented effort to demonize the liberty movement perhaps to the point of a Gladio-type false-flag campaign, leading to the eventual detention of activists as domestic security threats. It’s not going to end with shootings in pizzerias and slobbering hit pieces from the SPLC.  Expect a landslide of violent acts.  Expect another engineered large-scale calamity like the Oklahoma City Bombing.  Expect dozens of Timothy McVeighs to be trotted out in the media. Expect the Liberty Movement&#8217;s name to be buried in an avalanche of bullshit. Mark my words; it’s going to get much worse from here on.</p>
<p>And this is where I will add my warning.</p>
<p>Before the Bundy ranch became a possible battleground, I stated in my article <a style="color: #006699;" href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2089-real-americans-are-ready-to-snap">“Real Americans Are Ready To Snap”</a> that the liberty movement was going to draw a line in the sand over Bureau of Land Management abuses in Bunkerville, and I was right.</p>
<p>It seems to me that time is growing short. As tyrants become more bold, so too must the citizenry; otherwise, we shrivel up and die.  We cannot allow the movement&#8217;s momentum to be shattered and driven underground as the militia movement was after Oklahoma City.  We know what is coming, and we must drive forward.  We know we will be labeled as terrorists and villains, and ultimately, we must realize that such eventualities do not matter.  The Liberty Movement is not going away.  In fact, future clashes with our criminal government are only going to become more frequent.</p>
<p>The next family threatened, the next activist individual or group arrested or black-bagged without legitimate cause, the next major false flag, the next use of military forces as civil law enforcement, the next unConstitutional misstep, and I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind that a revolt will erupt. It’s not about making grand predictions; it’s about examining the logical odds, and the odds are high. The knowledge that the establishment is considering using the full force of its military apparatus against the people has not dissuaded anyone. Bundy ranch was a very near miss. I do not expect a peaceful resolution the next time around. I also do not expect the government as it exists now to stop clamoring for more control or less corruption. If recent events have proven anything, they have proven that a second American Revolution is inevitable; and all we can do is ready ourselves.</p>

			<p>For the last few years, I have been blogging here about how <a style="color: #743399;" href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2012/07/14/tsa-does-not-keep-you-safe-it-never-has-it-never-will/" target="_blank">TSA does not protect you</a> from terrorism and how <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2014/03/01/lockdown-lunacy-schooling-for-life-in-a-police-state/" target="_blank">school lockdowns</a> do not keep students safe.</p>

<p>According to <a style="color: #743399;" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/27/wantagh-high-school-seals-lockers-bans-backpacks-in-wake-of-bomb-threats/" target="_blank">WCBS TV in New York</a>:</p>

<p><em>The new rules went into effect Tuesday and officials said they will remain in effect for the rest of the school year.</em></p>
<p><em>According to a letter from Superintendent of Schools Maureen Goldberg <a style="color: #743399;" href="http://www.wantaghschools.org/cms/lib05/NY01001016/Centricity/Domain/1/The%20following%20message%20was%20sent%20to%20Wantagh%20High%20School%20students%20this%20evening.pdf" target="_blank">posted on the district’s website</a>, no backpacks or large bags will be allowed inside the school.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, all books and personal belongings must be kept in a clear bag and all bags will be checked as students enter the school in the morning and when returning to the building after lunch.</em></p>

I mean, like, they could catch potential bombers.</p>
<p>You don’t have to carry a gun or a bomb into a building in order to kill a lot of people. All that needs to happen is for some Tim McVeigh copycat wannabe to park a truck outside the school, detonate a bomb and kill a whole lot of people.</p>
<p>The entire “security” apparatus that has grown up in the last decade in America may make some people feel safe. However, it does not keep us safe at all.</p>

</div>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">Edward Snowden&#8230;</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">Is Edward Snowden a radical? The dictionary defines a radical as “an advocate of political and social revolution”, the adjective form being “favoring or resulting in extreme or revolutionary changes”. That doesn’t sound like Snowden as far as what has been publicly revealed. In common usage, the term “radical” usually connotes someone or something that goes beyond the generally accepted boundaries of socio-political thought and policies; often used by the Left simply to denote more extreme than, or to the left of, a “liberal”.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">In his <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #02588d;" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview" target="_blank">hour-long interview on NBC</a>, May 28, in Moscow, Snowden never expressed, or even implied, any thought – radical or otherwise – about United States foreign policy or the capitalist economic system under which we live, the two standard areas around which many political discussions in the US revolve. In fact, after reading a great deal by and about Snowden this past year, I have no idea what his views actually are about these matters. To be sure, in the context of the NBC interview, capitalism was not at all relevant, but US foreign policy certainly was.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Snowden was not asked any direct questions about foreign policy, but if I had been in his position I could not have replied to several of the questions without bringing it up. More than once the interview touched upon the question of whether the former NSA contractor’s actions had caused “harm to the United States”. Snowden said that he’s been asking the entire past year to be presented with evidence of such harm and has so far received nothing. I, on the other hand, as a radical, would have used the opportunity to educate the world-wide audience about how the American empire is the greatest threat to the world’s peace, prosperity, and environment; that anything to slow down the monster is to be desired; and that throwing a wrench into NSA’s surveillance gears is eminently worthwhile toward this end; thus, “harm” indeed should be the goal, not something to apologize for.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Edward added that the NSA has been unfairly “demonized” and that the agency is composed of “good people”. I don’t know what to make of this.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">When the war on terrorism was discussed in the interview, and the question of whether Snowden’s actions had hurt that effort, he failed to take the opportunity to point out the obvious and absolutely essential fact – that US foreign policy, by its very nature, regularly and routinely creates anti-American terrorists.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">When asked what he’d say to President Obama if given a private meeting, Snowden had no response at all to make. I, on the other hand, would say to Mr. Obama: “Mr. President, in your time in office you’ve waged war against seven countries – Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. This makes me wonder something. With all due respect, sir: What is wrong with you?”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">A radical – one genuine and committed – would not let such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity pass by unused. Contrary to what his fierce critics at home may believe, Edward Snowden is not seriously at war with America, its government or its society. Does he have a real understanding, analysis, or criticism of capitalism or US foreign policy? Does he think about what people could be like under a better social system? Is he, I wonder, even anti-imperialist?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">And he certainly is not a conspiracy theorist, or at least keeps it well hidden. He was asked about 9-11 and replied:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">The 9/11 commission … when they looked at all the classified intelligence from all the different intelligence agencies, they found that we had all of the information we needed … to detect this plot. We actually had records of the phone calls from the United States and out. The CIA knew who these guys were. The problem was not that we weren’t collecting information, it wasn’t that we didn’t have enough dots, it wasn’t that we didn’t have a haystack, it was that we did not understand the haystack that we had.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">Whereas I might have pointed out that the Bush administration may have ignored the information because they wanted something bad – perhaps of unknown badness – to happen in order to give them the justification for all manner of foreign and domestic oppression they wished to carry out. And did. (This scenario of course excludes the other common supposition, that it was an “inside job”, in which case collecting information on the perpetrators would not have been relevant.)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The entire segment concerning 9/11 was left out of the television broadcast of the interview, although some part of it was shown later during a discussion. This kind of omission is of course the sort of thing that feeds conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">All of the above notwithstanding, I must make it clear that I have great admiration for the young Mr. Snowden, for what he did and for how he expresses himself. He may not be a radical, but he is a hero. His moral courage, nerve, composure, and technical genius are magnificent. I’m sure the NBC interview won him great respect and a large number of new supporters. I, in Edward’s place, would be even more hated by Americans than he is, even if I furthered the radicalization of more of them than he has. However, I of course would never have been invited onto mainstream American television for a long interview in prime time. (Not counting my solitary 15 minutes of fame in 2006 courtesy of Osama bin Laden; a gigantic fluke happening.)</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Apropos Snowden’s courage and integrity, it appears that something very important has not been emphasized in media reports: In the interview, he took the Russian government to task for a new law requiring bloggers to register – the same government which holds his very fate in their hands.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">Who is more exceptional: The United States or Russia?</h3>
<p style="color: #222222;">I was going to write a commentary about President Obama’s speech to the graduating class at the US Military Academy (West Point) on May 28. When he speaks to a military audience the president is usually at his most nationalistic, jingoist, militaristic, and American-exceptionalist – wall-to-wall platitudes. But this talk was simply TOO nationalistic, jingoist, militaristic, and American-exceptionalist. (“I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being.”) To go through it line by line in order to make my usual wise-ass remarks, would have been just too painful. However, if you’re in a masochistic mood and wish to read it, <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #02588d;" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/28/remarks-president-west-point-academy-commencement-ceremony" target="_blank">it can be found here</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Instead I offer you part of a <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #02588d;" href="http://blog.transnational.org/2014/05/tff-pressinfo-why-obamas-speech-should-make-us-think/" target="_blank">commentary from Mr. Jan Oberg</a>, Danish director of the Transnational Foundation for Peace and Future Research in Lund, Sweden:</p>
<blockquote style="color: #222222;">
<p style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">What is <em>conspicuously lacking</em> in the President’s West Point speech?</p>
<ol style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Any reasonably accurate appraisal of the world and the role of other nations.</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">A sense of humility and respect for allies and other countries in this world.</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Every element of a grand strategy for America for its foreign and security policy and some kind of vision of what a better world would look like. This speech with all its tired, self-aggrandising rhetoric is a thin cover-up for the fact that there is no such vision or overall strategy.</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Some little hint of reforms of existing institutions or new thinking about globalisation and global democratic decision-making.</li>
<li style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Ideas and initiatives – stretched-out hands – to help the world move towards conflict-resolution in crisis areas such as Ukraine, Syria, Libya, China-Japan and Iran. Not a trace of creativity.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: #222222;">Ironically, on May 30 the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published a long essay by Leon Aron, a Russia scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. The essay took Russian president Vladimir Putin to task for claiming that Russia is exceptional. The piece was headed:</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“Why Putin Says Russia Is Exceptional”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“Such claims have often heralded aggression abroad and harsh crackdowns at home.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">It states: “To Mr. Putin, in short, Russia was exceptional because it was emphatically not like the modern West – or not, in any event, like his caricature of a corrupt, morally benighted Europe and U.S. This was a bad omen, presaging the foreign policy gambits against Ukraine that now have the whole world guessing about Mr. Putin’s intentions.”</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">So the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has no difficulty in ascertaining that a particular world leader sees his country as “exceptional”. And that such a perception can lead that leader or his country to engage in aggression abroad and crackdowns at home. The particular world leader so harshly judged in this manner by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> is named Vladimir Putin, not Barack Obama. There’s a word for this kind of analysis – It’s called <em>hypocrisy</em>.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">“Hypocrisy is anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man, but the least wide-awake of children recognizes it, and is revolted by it, however ingeniously it may be disguised.” – Leo Nikolaevich Tolstoi, (1828-1910) Russian writer</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Is hypocrisy a moral failing or a failing of the intellect?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">The New Cold War is getting to look more and more like the old one, wherein neither side allows the other to get away with any propaganda point. Just compare any American television network to the Russian station broadcast in the United States – RT (formerly <em>Russia Today</em>). The contrast in coverage of the same news events is remarkable, and the stations attack and make fun of each other by name.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">Another, even more important, feature to note is that in Cold War I the United States usually had to consider what the Soviet reaction would be to a planned American intervention in the Third World. This often served as a brake to one extent or another on Washington’s imperial adventures. Thus it was that only weeks after the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the United States bombed and invaded Panama, inflicting thousands of casualties and widespread destruction, for the flimsiest – bordering on the non-existent – of reasons.  The hostile Russian reaction to Washington’s clear involvement in the overthrow of the Ukrainian government in February of this year, followed by Washington’s significant irritation and defensiveness toward the Russian reaction, indicates that this Cold War brake may have a chance of returning. And for this we should be grateful.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">After the “communist threat” had disappeared and the foreign policy of the United States continued absolutely unchanged, it meant that the Cold War revisionists had been vindicated – the conflict had not been about containing an evil called “communism”; it had been about American expansion, imperialism and capitalism. If the collapse of the Soviet Union did not result in any reduction in the American military budget, but rather was followed by large increases, it meant that the Cold War – from Washington’s perspective – had not been motivated by a fear of the Russians, but purely by ideology.</p>
<h3 style="color: #222222;">Lest we forget: Our present leaders can derive inspiration from other great American leaders.</h3>

			<p>It is easy to stand up and cheer for your favorite government activity. It is quite another to acknowledge what it means in the real world.</p>
<p>I almost never try to speak for other people. However, I think it is fairly safe to say that the average military recruit firmly believes that he joins the military so that you and I can live and breathe in freedom. To be sure, he had other reasons for joining, but I think the defense of liberty is a fairly common characteristic.</p>
<p>That is certainly what I thought when I was in Navy boot camp in Orlando, Florida, in 1983. After all, this is what I had been told all my life: sailors, soldiers, airmen and marines defend freedom.</p>
<p>But is this actually what they do?</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Marine lost both legs in an IED blast in Iraq. He claims he was forced by TSA to <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/mar/19/tsa-agents-humiliated-wounded-marine-aggressive-in/" target="_blank">remove both prosthetic legs</a> before he could board an airplane in Phoenix.</li>
<li>This Vietnam veteran in Spicewood, Texas, had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/08/raids-of-the-day-the-capi_n_2644894.html" target="_blank">flashbacks to his combat experience during a marijuana raid</a> at a friend’s house. What police claimed was marijuana turned out to be ragweed.<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jared-goering.jpg?w=300&amp;h=152" alt="jared goering" width="300" height="152" /></a></li>
<li>Jared Goering, who served 19 years in the Army, including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was <a href="http://www.lifewithdogs.tv/2013/08/veteran-kicked-off-boardwalk-for-having-a-service-dog/" target="_blank">kicked off the boardwalk in Wildwood, N.J.</a> for walking with his service dog, Gator.</li>
<li>Emily Yates, who served two tours with the Army in Iraq, was <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=3bf_1378009165" target="_blank">violently arrested by park police in Philadelphia</a> for asking why she couldn’t play her banjo under some shade trees.</li>
<li>Dimitrios Karras is a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan. Read about the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/ares-armor-operating-store-camera-caught-first-moments-of-saturday-raid" target="_blank">ATF raid on his business</a> in National City, California.</li>
<li>Martin Goldberg of Brooklyn is a World War II veteran <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/raid-of-t_n_3102929.html" target="_blank">whose apartment was subject to a drug raid</a>. Later, the cops realized they had raided the wrong apartment. His 83-year-old wife was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat as a result of the raid.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/norfolk-41.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/norfolk-41.jpg?w=640" alt="norfolk 4" /></a></li>
<li>In 1997, four sailors from the USS Saipan (LHA-2) were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19Norfolk-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">falsely accused</a> of the rape and murder of a Norfolk, Virginia, woman. One spent eight-and-one-half years in prison while the other three were sentenced to life in prison. These three were pardoned in 2009. Even though the actual killer is serving a life sentence, four innocent men are still required to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Four" target="_blank">register as sex offenders</a> and are still <a href="http://www.norfolkfour.com/" target="_blank">fighting to clear their names</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/charles.loeks/posts/584864751544987?comment_id=6139516&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=4&amp;notif_t=feed_comment_reply" target="_blank">Charles Loeks</a> was 18 and fresh out of Marine boot camp. On a trip home to Covina, California, he was hanging out with a few friends when he was arrested for resisting arrest and nothing else. He spent 21 days in Los Angeles County jail, even though he had harmed no one.</li>
<li><a href="http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2014/04/22/north-carolina-deputy-snatches-two-phones-fails-snatch-third-handcuffs-man-reason/" target="_blank">Carlos Jaramillo</a> is a former Marine combat instructor who lives in Onslow County, North Carolina. Watch what happened when he recorded a sheriff’s deputy who arrested him for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>Noel Polanco was an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/nyregion/funeral-for-noel-polanco-unarmed-man-killed-by-police.html" target="_blank">unarmed 22-year-old National Guardsman</a> who was shot and killed by New York City police at a traffic stop near LaGuardia Airport.</li>
<li>John Laigaie, a retired Army master sergeant, was <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/bellingham-man-wins-15000-settlement-after-city-co/nZPdj/" target="_blank">threatened at gunpoint</a> by police while legally carrying a gun in a park in Bellingham, Washington.</li>
<li>Homer Wright is an 80-year-old Army veteran who was <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/80-year-old-homeowner-arrested-for-shooting-burglar.html" target="_blank">charged with felony gun use</a> after he shot a burglar who entered his home in Englewood, Illinois.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/schmidter.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/schmidter.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225" alt="schmidter" width="300" height="225" /></a></li>
<li>Mark Schmidter, a Vietnam veteran who lives in Orlando, is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WeAreMarkSchmidter/info" target="_blank">currently serving 145 days in a cage</a> for passing out <a href="http://fija.org/" target="_blank">jurors’ rights</a> information on the steps of a local courthouse.</li>
<li>Justin Ross of Ankeny, Iowa, was recently discharged from the Army. <a href="http://whotv.com/2014/02/03/raid-filmed-ankeny-police-traumatize-family/" target="_blank">Police used a battering ram</a> to enter his home executing a warrant for some items purchased with stolen credit cards. They did not find any of these items.</li>
<li>Saadiq Long is an Air Force veteran who was placed on a TSA no-fly list. He had to <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/US-Air-Force-Veteran-Fina-by-Glenn-Greenwald-130210-789.html" target="_blank">battle for months</a> to be removed from this list just so he could fly home from Qatar to visit his ailing mother.</li>
<li>Chuck Benton of Long Grove, Iowa, served 22 years in the Army. He was <a href="http://rare.us/story/im-a-christian-and-i-want-to-end-the-drug-war/" target="_blank">arrested and charged</a> simply for living in the same house with his son who was <a href="http://qctimes.com/news/local/medical-marijuana-heads-for-trial-in-iowa/article_3f94aa61-1fe8-5462-b2bf-4d5b598824e4.html" target="_blank">growing medical marijuana</a>.</li>
<li>Cody Donovan is a former Marine MP who lives in New Milford, N.J. He was <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/newmilford/New_Milford_man_allegedly_carried_loaded_gun_to_Garden_State_Plaza_during_shooting.html?mobile=1&amp;ic=1&amp;iphone=1" target="_blank">charged with unlawful possession of a weapon</a> after carrying a loaded gun into the Garden State Plaza mall when he attempted to help police apprehend the shooter.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bonus-march2.gif"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bonus-march2.gif?w=300&amp;h=226" alt="bonus march" width="300" height="226" /></a></li>
<li>In 1932, 17,000 veterans marched on Washington to demand payment of bonuses they had been promised as a result of their service in World War I. Two were shot and killed by police. 55 were arrested and 135 were injured when the United States Army became an instrument of domestic law enforcement. Two of the chief enforcers were named MacArthur and Patton. Yes, those two.</li>
<li>Mark England, an Army combat medic who saw action in Iraq and Kosovo was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48iLJ8NCEF8">beaten and tasered by police</a> at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas.</li>
<li>Air Force Staff Sergeant Matt Pinkerton of Glen Burnie, Maryland, faces <a href="http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/for_the_record/attorney-glen-burnie-shooting-was-self-defense/article_36bb4d67-b713-5b22-b6c5-d9e2b1d1016d.html" target="_blank">second degree murder charges</a> after fatally shooting a home intruder in September.</li>
<li>Leo Hendrick, an army veteran who lives in Northwood, Iowa, faces up to <a href="http://globegazette.com/news/local/northwood-chicken-trial-begins-tuesday/article_7ce23d57-2911-5b65-9ade-89a857e9b7c2.html" target="_blank">30 days in jail and a $600 fine</a> for raising chickens in his yard.</li>
<li>Yes, the cops had a search warrant. However that in no way excuses their <a href="http://www.king5.com/news/get-jesse/Lakewood-landlord-left-with-repair-bill-after-search-warrant-by-police-246460031.html" target="_blank">vandalizing the home</a> of Army veteran Dan Neary of Lakewood, Washington.</li>
<li>These World War II veterans were <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/10/vets-knock-down-barrier-to-visit-wwii-memorial/" target="_blank">threatened with arrest</a> for visiting a closed war memorial in Washington, D.C. during the October “shutdown.”<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vets-arrested-nyc1.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vets-arrested-nyc1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=260" alt="vets arrested nyc" width="300" height="260" /></a></li>
<li>These Vietnam <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/10/police-arrest-vietnam-veterans-nyc-memorial/70276/" target="_blank">veterans actually were arrested</a> for visiting a New York City war memorial after curfew.</li>
<li>Denis Reynoso was a disabled veteran who saw action with the Marines in Iraq. He <a href="http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/23350877/2013/09/05/one-person-transported-to-hospital-after-lynn-shooting" target="_blank">was shot dead by police</a> in his Lynn, Massachusetts, apartment.</li>
<li>Nick Morgan, an Iraq veteran, was pulled out of a crowd by police in Hempstead, New York, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZaJQUhVFH0" target="_blank">trampled by their horses</a>.</li>
<li>Gary Shepherd of Broadhead, Kentucky was a Vietnam veteran. He used medical cannabis to relieve the pain in his left arm, which was crippled during the war. Shepherd was <a href="http://www.hr95.org/Memorial.html" target="_blank">shot dead by a SWAT team</a>, after they had threatened to cut down his cannabis plants.</li>
<li>Valente and Manuel Valenzuela of San Antonio produced sufficient documentation to enlist, respectively, in the Army and Marine Corps. Both fought in Vietnam, where Valente won a Bronze Star. Now they are <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Vietnam-veterans-at-risk-of-being-deported-4855055.php" target="_blank">facing deportation to Mexico</a> because of erroneous entries on their birth certificates.</li>
<li>Jerome Murdough, a homeless Marine Corps veteran, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/20/homeless-veteran-dies-in-overheated-rikers-island-cell/" target="_blank">died in a jail cell on New York’s Rikers Island</a> after being arrested for trespassing. A heating malfunction caused the temperature in the cell to soar to 100 degrees.</li>
<li>Kenneth Chamberlain was a retired Marine and Vietnam veteran living in White Plains, New York. Early one morning he set off his medical alert device. The first responders in this case were not medics, but rather <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yu6yIeL6Ts" target="_blank">police, who proceeded to kill Mr. Chamberlain</a>.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vets-for-64-colorado.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/vets-for-64-colorado.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169" alt="Colorado veterans say LEGALIZE!" width="300" height="169" /></a></li>
<li>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEnjYprPqmk" target="_blank">group of combat veterans in Colorado</a> organized to help <a href="http://regulatemarijuana.org/" target="_blank">legalize marijuana</a> during the 2012 elections. They claim – and I believe them – that marijuana helps mitigate PTSD. If you support any punishment whatsoever for a <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2013/03/22/treating-ptsd-with-medical-marijuana" target="_blank">combat veteran who heals himself</a> with a plant that grows wild in some form within a few miles of you, I don’t care what you tell me. YOU DON’T BELIEVE IN FREEDOM!</li>
<li>Stanley Gibson, a <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/disabled-veteran-killed-police-shooting" target="_blank">43-year-old Gulf War veteran</a> was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVpT3d6ik-8" target="_blank">shot dead over a total non-crime</a> by Las Vegas police in December, 2011.</li>
<li>Army Specialist Michael Sharkey returned home from deployment in Afghanistan to find his home in New Port Richey, Florida, unlawfully occupied by two squatters. The local sheriff says that Sharkey has <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2610917/Outrage-pair-ex-convict-squatters-Florida-home-Afghan-war-veteran-refuse-leave.html" target="_blank">no grounds upon which to evict them</a>.</li>
<li>These veterans say they are being required to <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/03/va-says-routine-is-to-threaten-vets-gun-rights/" target="_blank">prove they are worthy of gun rights</a>. Our rights are <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2012/07/01/life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-godliness-a-sermon-i-would-like-to-preach/" target="_blank">gifts from God</a> that are inherent in our very humanity. We never have to prove to anybody that we have them.</li>
<li>Dwight Edwards, a disabled Marine veteran of Afghanistan, says that cops in Queens <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/ex-marine-claims-cops-beat-103rd-precinct-article-1.1327916" target="_blank">brutally beat him for no reason</a>.</li>
<li>Army Staff Sgt. C.J. Grisham, who won the Bronze Star with Valor, was <a href="http://www.kcentv.com/story/21860185/local-soldier-says-police-violated-his-guns-rights" target="_blank">forcibly disarmed for no good reason by a policeman</a> while on a hike with his son not far from Fort Hood, Texas.<br />

<li>Brandon Raub, a Marine who was decorated for bravery in Iraq and Afghanistan, was forced to spend a week in a Virginia mental hospital over <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=N5dA1N3S9Es" target="_blank">some “anti-government” Facebook posts</a>.

<li>Hector Barrios came to America in 1961. He was drafted and served as an infantry soldier in Vietnam. In 1996, he was busted for possessing marijuana, which he used to treat his PTSD. As a result, he was <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/04/25/Vietnam-vet-dies-abroad-deported-from-the-country-he-served/5401398450290/" target="_blank">deported to his native Mexico</a> where he died.</li>
<li>Matthew Corrigan of Washington, D.C. was a first sergeant in the Army Reserve and a veteran of Iraq. <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/guns/2012/may/28/miller-swat-rampage-destroys-iraq-vets-home-over-g/" target="_blank">His home was destroyed in a SWAT rampage</a> because it was reported to the police that Corrigan had a gun.</li>
<li>Jamie Dean was an Army veteran of Afghanistan was diagnosed with PTSD. Upset about his impending deployment to Iraq, Dean had an intense emotional outburst at his Maryland home in December 2006. Even though he neither harmed nor threatened anyone, he was <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig7/bothwell2.html" target="_blank">shot and killed by a local SWAT team</a>.<br />

<li>To be sure, the recently deceased folk singer Pete Seeger could not have been more of a leftist. However, he did serve three years in the Army after being drafted during World War II. He was <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/pete_seeger_1919_2014_he_changed_the_world_one_song_at_a_time" target="_blank">sentenced to one year in jail</a> after refusing to reveal his political connections to the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956. He appealed this sentence, citing the First Amendment, and ultimately spent only four hours behind bars.</li>
<li>Larry Kirschenman of Nogales, Arizona, served 22 years in the Army and was decorated for bravery in Vietnam. Learn how he was brutalized by Border Patrol agents when asking why he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1-U7beD4I4" target="_blank">subjected to a warrantless search</a>.</li>
<li>We will never know for sure what happened in Army veteran Matthew Stewart’s Ogden, Utah, apartment one night in January 2012, as he will never have his day in court. He was in prison awaiting trial on charges of shooting and killing one of the police officers who raided his apartment searching for marijuana. Stewart, whose guilt was never proven, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/24/matthew-david-stewart_n_3332915.html" target="_blank">committed suicide in his cell. </a></li>

<li>On May 5, 2011, a Tucson SWAT team approached the home of Jose Guerena, who had served two tours with the Marines in Iraq. Guerena grabbed his AR-15 as is his right, but did not fire. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/tucson-swat-team-defends-shooting-iraq-marine-veteran/story?id=13640112#.UZYlqEqS2MI" target="_blank">The SWAT team let loose with 71 rounds, 60 of which perforated Guerena’s body.</a></li>
<li>Marty Maiden lived a few blocks from Guerena in Tucson. and saw action with the Army in Afghanistan. He posted a suicidal note on Facebook which prompted a call to the police, <a href="http://www.jrn.com/kgun9/news/A-man-is-dead-after-officer-involved-shooting-232690341.html" target="_blank">who shot him dead</a>.</li>
<li>Steve Lefemine is a <a href="http://lefemineforlife.net/?p=82" target="_blank">West Point graduate</a> who was arrested for protesting against abortion in a “no-demonstration zone” outside the Republican National Convention in New York in 2004. The 2nd Circuit U.S. Circuit Court justified the arrest based on a <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/08_-_August/2nd_Circuit_upholds_RNC_arrests_of_two_anti-abortion_protesters/" target="_blank">“compelling state interest in security”</a>.<br />

<li>Eileen Erickson’s husband Sid served in Vietnam and died of Agent Orange exposure. Erickson is now in the crosshairs of authorities in Venice, California, who want to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-lopez-treehouse-20130911,0,6227023.column" target="_blank">tear down the tree house</a> Sid built before he died.</li>
<li>Listen to this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C430EHLtAZs" target="_blank">disabled Navy veteran plead</a> with then-Senate candidate Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) about the benefits of medical marijuana. Listen to the totalitarian response.</li>
<li>John Wrana, a 95-year-old Army Air Corps veteran of World War II, was <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-03/news/ct-met-kass-0802-20130803_1_butcher-type-kitchen-knife-park-forest-police-taser" target="_blank">tasered and then shot to death</a> by police in Forest Park, Illinois. His “crime”? Refusing medical attention.</li>
<li>John Colaprete saw action in Vietnam as a Marine Corps officer. In 1994, his Virginia Beach home and restaurants were the object of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/us/3-businessmen-testify-of-armed-raids-by-irs.html" target="_blank">paramilitary-style raids by the IRS</a>. The raid was prompted by a false accusation by a former employee. While you need to watch this documentary in its entirety some time, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">for now just pick it up for a few minutes starting at the 55:40 mark</a>.<br />

<li>Boxing legend Joe Louis was also tyrannized by the IRS. The Brown Bomber enlisted in the Army in 1942 saying “Let us at them Japs.” Louis never saw combat, as he was assigned to the Special Services Division. While still a civilian, Louis fought some charity bouts and donated the proceeds to the Navy Relief Society. The IRS, however, viewed these proceeds as taxable income. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Louis#World_War_II" target="_blank">IRS problems would plague him</a> all his life. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ayb02bwp0" target="_blank">Please watch this video starting at the 53:17 mark.</a></li>
<li>Adam Arroyo is a Hispanic veteran of the Iraq war who lives in Buffalo. <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130604/CITYANDREGION/130609629/1002" target="_blank">Police shot and killed his dog</a> while executing a drug warrant for a black man.</li>
<li>Henry Taylor was a retired Air Force veteran in Louisville, Tennessee, who was <a href="http://www.thedailytimes.com/Local_News/story/Blount-County-Sheriffs-deputy-shoots-kills-property-owner-during-security-check-id-039818" target="_blank">shot dead by a local sheriff’s deputy</a> while investigating a burglary at a rental property he owned.</li>

It is absolutely tragic how we chew up and spit out so many of those we send to “fight for our freedom.”<br />

<li>Radio talk host Adam Kokesh won the Navy Commendation Medal as a Marine in Iraq. In recent years, he has been <a href="http://libertycrier.com/avtm-4-0-crowdfunder-campaign/?utm_source=The+Liberty+Crier&amp;utm_campaign=00062d8203-The_Liberty_Crier_Daily_News_2_5_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_600843dec4-00062d8203-284780633" target="_blank">arrested several times for various non-violent protests</a>. His most recent arrest happened after he loaded a shotgun in public in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 2013. On July 10, police <a href="http://oathkeepers.org/oath/2013/07/12/thoughts-on-the-police-raid-on-adam-kokesh-and-on-his-canceled-march/" target="_blank">violently raided his home and arrested him</a>. He was incarcerated for four months <a href="http://benswann.com/adam-kokesh-a-modern-day-political-prisoner/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=nl" target="_blank">without bond, bail or trial</a>. He is currently on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kokesh" target="_blank">probation for two years</a>. You may not like Kokesh’s demeanor or approve of all of his antics, but he has been very courageous when so many of his critics can’t be bothered to put down the remote.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/james-moore.jpg?w=640" alt="james moore" /></a></li>
<li>James Moore, my brothah from anothah mothah, walked away from a very lucrative engineering position in San Jose to re-enlist in the Army following 9/11. He sustained significant physical injuries as well as PTSD while serving in the Special Forces in Afghanistan. On the afternoon of March 25, 2008, Moore, who had done absolutely nothing wrong, was <a href="http://www.freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2012/04/necessary-force.html">beaten to the point of flat lining by Denver police.</a></li>
<li>One of the coolest people I have never met is Antonio Buehler. Buehler graduated from West Point in 1999, earned his Ranger tab, and saw action in Kosovo and Iraq. (He also sports a Stanford MBA.) Early in the morning on January 1, 2012, Buehler <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNVZDpGCKks" target="_blank">was arrested</a> for taking a few pictures of Austin police manhandling a young woman outside a 7-11. Buehler has been arrested four times since. He heads the <a href="http://peacefulstreets.com/" target="_blank">Peaceful Streets Project</a>, whose members work to expose abuse, brutality and overreach both in Austin and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FreeAntonioBuehler/" target="_blank">across the nation</a>.<br />
<a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/antonio-buehler.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/antonio-buehler.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168" alt="antonio buehler" width="300" height="168" /></a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are no doubt numerous other injustices against veterans that I do not know about. Enough to fill a book. None of these things would have happened if America were a free society. As Kokesh puts it, “The greatest enemies to the Constitution are not to be found in the sands of some far off land but rather right here at home.”</p>
<p>I cannot speak to the specific political beliefs of most of the veterans I have mentioned here. Some may be pacifists, while others may make John McCain look like a hippie in Haight-Ashbury. No matter what their individual views may be, the freedom they risked their lives for was flagrantly violated on the streets of the land they fought to protect.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/ohio_class.jpg?w=586" alt="With the ability to carry 192 nuclear warheads, just one Ohio-class submarine is the world's sixth largest nuclear power." /></a></p>
<p>Society endlessly applauds sailors, soldiers, airmen and Marines for “fighting for our freedom”. It is in no way disrespectful to say that this is not what they do. No foreign government or terrorist group poses any threat to our liberty. America accounts for about half of the world’s military spending. We have 300 ships in our Navy, plus thousands of planes, tanks and nuclear warheads as well as 300 million firearms in private hands. Nobody is going to invade us.</p>
<p>In a constitutional country, which America ceased to be 100 years ago, the job of the military – a vital and most noble one – is to defend the borders, shores and airspace. It cannot protect you from being tyrannized domestically. Indeed, throughout history, armies have been instruments of domestic tyranny. Our Constitution forbids a standing army for just this reason.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tienanmen.jpg"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/tienanmen.jpg?w=586" alt="Keeping'em free." /></a></p>
<p>Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia had enormous military establishments. How did things work out in these countries?</p>
<p>I am a Christian who believes liberty is a gift from God – Leviticus 25:10; II Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:1. To quote Jefferson, liberty is preserved not by military might, but by “eternal vigilance” against one’s own government at all levels. It is the grossest form of disrespect to send young men around the world to “fight for freedom” while relinquishing that freedom on the home front.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif"><img src="http://foodforthethinkers.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/soldier-letter-cartoon.gif?w=586" alt="soldier letter cartoon" /></a>For several years, America has had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate" target="_blank">world’s highest incarceration rate</a>. Since 2001, Americans have gladly accepted previously unthinkable intrusions on their freedom in the name of “safety” and “security”. These include, but are not limited to: <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig6/napolitano2.html" target="_blank">warrantless searches and spying</a>, the <a href="http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hornberger/hornberger130.html" target="_blank">suspension of habeas corpus</a>, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2011/07/14/tsa-does-not-protect-you-period/" target="_blank">sexual assault as a condition of travel</a>, rampant <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/350955711587953/" target="_blank">police brutality</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/" target="_blank">indefinite detention</a> without any semblance of due process, severe <a href="http://ericpetersautos.com/2012/05/02/were-almost-there-now/" target="_blank">restrictions on peaceful protest</a>, massive <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2013/03/11/1-6-billion-rounds-of-ammo-for-homeland-security-its-time-for-a-national-conversation/" target="_blank">ammunition purchases by DHS</a> and <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/the_empire_strikes_back_attack_of_the_drones" target="_blank">surveillance drones in our skies</a> watching our every move. Can <a href="http://freedominourtime.blogspot.com/2011/07/imperial-priorities-obedience-first.html" target="_blank">predator drones</a> be far behind?</p>
<p>And in every election 98 percent of voters put their stamp of approval on perpetuating this monstrosity.</p>

<p>On April 20, 2013, <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/20/but-they-got-the-suspect-thats-not-the-point/" target="_blank">Boston and several surrounding towns</a> got a <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/25/lockdowns-do-not-keep-you-safe-letter-to-the-denver-post/" target="_blank">serious taste</a> of <a href="http://foodforthethinkers.com/2013/04/23/sometimes-martial-law-is-necessary/" target="_blank">martial law</a>. How many military veterans were on the receiving end of this? Is this what they signed up to fight for?</p>
<p>Stop thinking in clichés. Have a good hard look at everything your media and government tell you. This includes media outlets and parts of the government that you like. Study. Read. Ask questions. And learn that the defense of liberty is not the duty of the military. Rather, it is your duty and mine.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the CIA and its friends have taken a strong interest in Mick Jagger (seen above with Obama).</p>
<p>The CIA plan is to control the minds of the musicians and then use the musicians to control the minds of the populace.</p>
<p>The CIA uses drugs and Satanism when it mind-controls the stars.</p>

<i>Anita Pallenberg and Mick Jagger.</i></p>

<p>In London, &#8216;Anger recruited Anita Pallenberg to Satanism&#8217;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.globaltruth.net%2Fside123.html&amp;ei=0wMoU_rkH4HO0AX4hYDYBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAtVguImsjygG81Yw9YR5RijAtpw&amp;sig2=cXO02zcSBaM4cYKa70YHcg">The Rolling Stones and The Occult &#8211; Global Truth</a></p>
<p>She became the lover of three members of the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Anger said of Anita, said, &#8220;I believe that Anita is, for want of a better word, a witch&#8230;The occult unit within the Stones was Keith and Anita&#8230;and Brian. You see, Brian was a witch too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony Sanchez wrote of Pallenberg in his book, <i>Up and Down with the Rolling Stones</i>, &#8220;She was obsessed with black magic.&#8221;</p>

In 1980, Scott Cantrell, the seventeen-year-old caretaker of Keith Richard&#8217;s New England estate, was found shot dead in Anita Pallenberg&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>Keith Richard&#8217;s house was located near the East Coast headquarters of the Process Church.</p>
<p>According to an article in the English newspaper <i>Midnite</i>, a Connecticut police officer, Michael Passaro, who had responed to the &#8220;suicide&#8221; reported &#8220;strange singing&#8221; from the woods a quarter mile from the Richard&#8217;s mansion.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, &#8220;There have been several bizarre satanic rituals in the area over the past five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1967, the Rolling Stones released Their Satanic Majesties Request.</p>

<p>Mick Jagger&#8217;s first link to LSD seems to have been David Snyderman, &#8216;a CIA operative&#8217;.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CF0QFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.secondsmagazine.com%2Farticles%2F48-constantine.php&amp;ei=U1UCUP79CIaX0QWczNCZBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFK7qJCKoc7cekC7walyMaOkc17vw&amp;sig2=LFpLJk8_ZCht0m9um69tSA">Alex Constantine</a>: &#8220;A CIA operative arrived in the lives of the Stones.</p>
<p>&#8220;He claimed to be a James Bond figure and he turned up with a valise full of every drug you can imagine.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point the Stones still hadn&#8217;t done LSD.</p>
<p>&#8220;They woke up one morning at the home of Keith Richards and here was this character slipping LSD into their tongues as they were waking up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why did the Rolling Stones&#8217;s pal David Sniderman/Schneidermann have &#8220;a whole collection of different passports in different names and with different nationalities on them.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>When one studies history, all events seem to revolve around the applications and degenerations of war. Great feats of human understanding, realization and enlightenment barely register in the mental footnotes of the average person. War is what we remember, idealize and aggrandize, which is why war is the tool most often exploited by oligarchy to distract the masses while it centralizes power.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few revolutions, most wars are instigated and controlled by financial elites, manipulating governments on both sides of the game to produce a preconceived result. The rise of National Socialism in Germany, for instance, was largely funded by corporate entities based in the U.S., including Rockefeller giant Standard Oil, JPMorgan and even IBM, which built the collating machines specifically used to organize Nazi extermination camps, the same machines <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/29/humanities.highereducation">IBM representatives serviced on site at places like Auschwitz</a>. As a public figure, Adolf Hitler was considered a joke by most people in German society, until, of course, the Nazi Party received incredible levels of corporate investment. This aid was most evident in what came to be known as the Keppler Fund created through the Keppler Circle, a group of interests with contacts largely based in the U.S.</p>
<p>George W. Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, used his position as director of the New York-based Union Banking Corporation to launder money for the Third Reich throughout the war. After being exposed and charged for trading with the enemy, the case against Bush magically disappeared in a puff of smoke, and the Bush family went on to become one of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar" target="_blank">most powerful political forces</a> in America.</p>
<p>Without the aid of international conglomerates and banks, the Third Reich would have never risen to power.</p>
<p>The rise of communism in Russia through the Bolshevik Revolution was no different. As outlined in Professor Antony Sutton’s book <em>Wall Street And The Bolshevik Revolution</em> with vast detail and irrefutable supporting evidence, it was globalist financiers that created the social petri dish in which the communist takeover flourished.  The same financiers that aided the Nazis&#8230;</p>
<p>The two sides, National Socialism and communism, were essentially identical despotic governmental structures conjured by the same group of elites. These two sides, these two fraudulent ideologies, were then pitted against each other in an engineered conflict that we now call World War II, resulting in an estimated 48 million casualties globally and the ultimate formation of the United Nations, a precursor to world government.</p>
<p>Every major international crisis for the past century or more has ended with an even greater consolidation of world power into the hands of the few, and this is no accident.</p>
<p>When I discuss the concept of the false left/right paradigm with people, especially those in the liberty movement, I often see a light turn on, a moment of awareness in their faces. Many of us understand the con game because we live it day to day. We see past the superficial rhetoric of Republican and Democratic party leadership and take note of their numerous similarities, including foreign policy, domestic defense policy and economic policy. The voting records of the major players in both parties are almost identical. One is hard-pressed to find much difference in ideology between Bush and Barack Obama, for example; or Obama and John McCain; or Obama and Mitt Romney, for that matter.</p>
<p>When I suggest, however, that similar false paradigms are used between two apparently opposed nations, the light fades, and people are left dumbstruck. Despite the fact that globalist financiers shoveled capital into the U.S., British, German and Soviet military complexes all at the same time during World War II, many Americans do not want to believe that such a thing could be happening today.</p>
<p>In response, I present the crisis in Ukraine versus the crisis in Syria&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Ukraine Versus Syria</strong></p>
<p>It seems as though much of the public has already forgotten that at the end of 2013, the U.S. came within a razor’s edge of economic disaster — not to mention the possibility of World War III. The war drums in Washington were thundering for “intervention” in Syria and the overthrow of Bashar Assad. The only thing that saved us, I believe, were the tireless efforts of the independent media in exposing the darker motives behind the Syrian insurgency and the bloodlust of the Obama Administration. The problem is that when the elites lose one avenue toward war and distraction, they have a tendency to simply create another. Eventually, the public is so overwhelmed by multiple trigger points and political powder kegs that they lose track of reality. I often call this the “scattergun effect.”</p>
<p>The crisis in the Ukraine is almost a carbon copy of the civil war in Syria, culminating in what I believe to be the exact same intent.</p>
<p><strong>The Money</strong></p>
<p>Money from globalist centers has been flowing into the Ukrainian opposition since at least 2004, when the Carnegie Foundation was caught <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041211/news_1n11usaid.html" target="_blank">filtering funds</a> to anti-Russian political candidate Viktor Yushchenko, as well as to the groups who supported him.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Supreme Court called for a runoff due to massive voter fraud and the rise of the pro-Western Orange Revolution, determining the winner to be Yushchenko over none other than Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych went on to win the 2010 elections, and the revolution returned to oust him this year.</p>
<p>It has been discovered that the current revolution has also been receiving funds from NATO and U.S. interests, not just from the State Department, but also from billionaires like <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/28/pierre-omidyar-co-funded-ukraine-revolution-groups-with-us-government-documents-show/" target="_blank">Pierre Omidyar</a>, the chairman of eBay and the new boss of journalist Glen Greenwald, the same journalist who is now famous for being the first to expose National Security Agency documents obtained by Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>Much of the monetary support from such financiers was being funneled to men like Oleh Rybachuk, the right-hand man to Yanukovych during the Orange Revolution and a favorite of neoconservatives and the State Department in the U.S.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/imf-ready-respond-ukraines-aid-bid-22696497" target="_blank">International Monetary Fund</a> has also jumped at the chance to throw money at the new Ukrainian regime, which would prevent default of the country and allow the opposition movement to focus their attentions on Russia.</p>
<p>The revolution in Syria was also primarily driven by Western funds and arms transferred through training grounds like Benghazi, Libya. There is much evidence to suggest that the<a href="http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/01/exclusive-dozens-of-cia-operatives-on-the-ground-during-benghazi-attack/" target="_blank">attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi</a> was designed to possibly cover up the arming of Syrian rebels by the CIA, who had agents on the ground who still have not been allowed to testify in front of Congress.</p>
<p>After this conspiracy was exposed in the mainstream, globalist-controlled governments decided to openly supply money and weapons to the Syrian insurgency, instead of ending the subterfuge.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Rebels’</strong></p>
<p>Some revolutions are quite real in their intent and motivations. But many either become co-opted by elites through financing, or they are created from thin air from the very beginning. Usually, the rebellions that are completely fabricated tend to lean toward extreme zealotry.</p>
<p>The Syrian insurgency is rife with, if not entirely dominated by, men associated with al-Qaida. Governments in the U.S. and Israel continue to support the insurgency despite their open affiliation with a group that is supposedly our greatest enemy. Syrian insurgents have been recorded committing numerous atrocities, including mass execution, the torture of civilians and even the cannibalism of human organs.</p>
<p>The revolution in Ukraine is run primarily by the Svoboda Party, a National Socialist (fascist) organization headed by Oleh Tyahnybok.  Here is a photo of Tyahnybok giving a familiar salute:</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.alt-market.com/images/stories/tyahnybok.jpg" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>So far, the opposition in Ukraine has been mostly careful in avoiding the same insane displays of random violence that plagued the Syrians’ public image. It is important to remember though that mainstream outlets like <em>Reuters</em> went far out of their way in attempts to humanize Syrian al-Qaida. Their methods were exposed only through the vigilance of the independent media. With the fascist Svoboda in power in the Ukraine, I believe it is only a matter of time before we see video reports of similar atrocities, giving Russia a perfect rationalization to use military force.</p>
<p><strong>John McCain?</strong></p>
<p>I am now thoroughly convinced that John McCain is a pasty ghoul of the highest order. He claims to be conservative yet supports almost every action of the Obama Administration. He is constantly defending anti-Constitutional actions by the Federal government, including the Enemy Belligerents Act, which was eventually melded into the National Defense Authorization Act; NSA surveillance of U.S. citizens; and even <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/25/schumer-mccain-say-gun-control-bills-will-return/" target="_blank">gun control</a>.</p>
<p>And for some reason, the guy makes appearances like clockwork right before or during major overthrows of existing governments. McCain was in Libya <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/libya-war-sen-john-mccain-visits-libyan-rebels/story?id=13439370" target="_blank">during the coup</a> against Moammar Gadhafi.</p>
<p>McCain showed up to essentially buy off the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/02/tunisia-mccain-meets-leaders-calls-revolution-very-successful.html" target="_blank">rebels in Tunisia</a>.</p>
<p>McCain hung out with <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/27/18536111-mccain-slips-into-syria-to-meet-with-rebel-leaders?lite" target="_blank">al-Qaida in Syria</a>.</p>
<p>And, what a surprise, McCain met with the Ukrainian opposition movement just before the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych.  Here is a photo of McCain giving a speech to the opposition with none other than Neo-Nazi Oleh Tyahnybok standing over his left shoulder.</p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.alt-market.com/images/stories/mccainnazi.jpg" border="0" /></p>
</div>
<p>Why McCain? I have no idea. All I know is, if this guy shows up in your country, take cover.</p>
<p><strong>Russia In The Middle</strong></p>
<p>The great danger in Syria was not necessarily the chance of war with Assad. Rather, it was the chance that a war with Assad would expand into a larger conflagration with Iran and Russia. Russia’s only naval facility in the Mideast is on the coast of Tartus in Syria, and Russia has long-standing economic and political ties to Syria and Iran. Any physical action by the West in the region would have elicited a response from Vladimir Putin. The mainstream argument claims that the threat of Russian intervention scared off Obama, but I believe the only reason war actions were not executed by the White House and the globalists was because they didn’t have even minimal support from the general public. For any war, you need at least a moderate percentage of the population to back your play.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, we find the globalists creating tensions between the West and the East yet again. Russia’s most vital naval base sits in Crimea, an autonomous state tethered to the Ukrainian mainland. Currently, Russia has flooded Crimea with troops in response to the regime change in Ukraine. The new Ukrainian government (backed by NATO) has called this an “invasion” and an act of war, while Western warmongers like McCain and Lindsay Graham spread <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/02/lindsey-graham-calls-obama-weak-indecisive-war-russia.html" target="_blank">the propaganda meme</a> that Russia made such a move only because Putin believes the Obama Administration to be “weak.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the idea here is to engineer either high tensions or eventual war between Russia and the United States. Syria failed to produce the desired outcome, so the Ukraine was tapped instead.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Markets And The Dollar At Risk</strong></p>
<p>In Syria, any U.S. led military action would have resulted in the immediate closing of the Straight of Hormuz by Iran, threatening to obstruct up to 30% of global petroleum shipments.  Foreign resentment could have easily led to the abandonment of the U.S. dollar as the petro-currency.  Both China and Russia implied the possibility of an economic response to American intervention, though they did not officially go into specifics.  In all likelihood, the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status would have been damaged irrevocably.</p>
<p>In the Ukraine, the chance of intervention has been countered with VERY specific threats from Russia, including <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/03/europes-dependence-on-russian-oil-and-gas-makes-it-hard-to-enact-meaningful-trade-sanctions/">a freeze on natural gas imports to the European Union through Gazprom</a>, which supplies approximately 30% of the EU&#8217;s fuel.  In 2009, a temporary Ukranian pipeline closure led to widespread shortages across Europe.  While some in the mainstream claim that Russia&#8217;s influence over EU energy has &#8220;diminished&#8221; the fact is a loss of 30% of natural gas reserves for an extended period would inflate energy prices wildly and cripple the EU&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>Another specific reaction given by Russia is the <a href="http://en.ria.ru/business/20140304/188081405/Putin-Adviser-Urges-Dumping-US-Bonds-In-Reaction-to-Sanctions.html">dumping of U.S. treasury bonds</a>.  Russia&#8217;s bond holdings may not seem like much leverage, except for the fact that China has now publicly backed Russian efforts in the Ukraine, just as they backed Russian opposition to U.S. activities in Syria.  A dump of bonds by Russia would invariably be followed by a Chinese dump as well.  In fact, China and Russia have been setting the stage for a global dollar decoupling since at least 2008.   I have been warning for years that globalists and central bankers needed a &#8220;cover event&#8221;, a distraction or scapegoat imposing enough to provide a veil of chaos in which they could then destroy the greenback as the world reserve and usher in a global currency system.  The Ukraine crisis offers yet another opportunity for this plan to unfold.</p>
<p><strong>The False Paradigm And The Globalist Chessboard</strong></p>
<p>So far, I have outlined what appears to be a correspondence of conspiracy between Syria and the Ukraine and how each event has the continued potential to trigger regional conflict, dollar collapse, or world war. But is this conspiracy one-sided? Are only the West and NATO being manipulated by globalists to box in Russia and provoke a conflict? And what do globalists have to gain by sparking such disaster?</p>
<p>As with every other catastrophic fabricated war, the goal is the erasure of sovereign identity while consolidating of economic, political and social power. It is not enough that global financiers dominate the banking industry and own most politicians; they want to transform the public psyche. They want US to ask THEM for global governance. This manufacture of consent is often achieved by pitting two controlled governments against each other and then, in the wake of the tragedy, calling for global unification. The argument is always presented that if we simply abandoned the concept of nation states and reform under a single world body, all war would “disappear.”</p>
<p>The question is whether Russia’s Putin is aware of the plan. Is he a part of it?  Are we seeing repeat theater of a puppet Russia versus a puppet NATO like that witnessed during the Cold War?</p>
<p>What I do know is that Putin has, a number of times in the past, called for global control of the economy through the IMF and the institution of a new global currency using the <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html" target="_blank">IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR)</a>.</p>
<p>Loans from the IMF are what saved Russia from debt default in the late 1990s. And Putin has recently called for consultations with the IMF concerning Crimea. Remember, this is the same IMF that is <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/russia-and-former-soviet-union/putin-seeks-ukraine-financial-aid-consultations-with-imf-g8-337851.html" target="_blank">working to fund his opponents</a> in Western Ukraine.</p>
<p>Bottom line, if you believe in national sovereignty and decentralization of power, Putin is NOT your buddy. Once again, we have the globalists injecting money into both sides of a conflict which could morph into something nightmarish.  Putin wants global economic governance and consolidation under the IMF just as much as the supposedly &#8220;American-run&#8221; IMF wants consolidation.  Global governance of finance and money creation ultimately means global governance of everything else.</p>
<p>Is a war being created through the false paradigm of East versus West in order to pave the road for global government?  Are East/West tensions being exploited as a smokescreen for the final destruction of the dollar&#8217;s world reserve status?  It is hard to say if the Ukraine will be the final trigger; however, the evidence suggests that if a conflict occurs, regardless of who “wins” such a scenario, the IMF comes out on top.</p>
<p>Imagine you are playing a game of chess by yourself. Which side wins at the end of that game: black or white? The answer is it doesn’t matter. You always win when you control both sides.</p>

<p align="left">Secret Tape Reveals US-backed Plot to Topple Ukraine&#8217;s Democratically-Elected President&#8230;

<blockquote><p><em>
<p align="left">“In the latest debacle for the US State Department and the Obama Administration, US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was caught on tape micro-managing Ukraine opposition party strategies with US Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt. That the Ukraine regime-change operation is to some degree being directed from Washington can no longer be denied….The taped conversation demonstrates in clear detail that while Secretary of State John Kerry decries any foreign meddling in Ukraine’s internal affairs, his State Department is virtually managing the entire process.”</p>
<p></em></p>
<p align="left">– Daniel McAdams, “‘<a href="http://ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2014/february/06/fstarstark-the-eu-tape-reveals-us-runs-ukraine-opposition.aspx">F**k the EU’: Tape Reveals US Runs Ukraine Opposition</a>“, Ron Paul Institute</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Washington is at it again, up to its old tricks. You’d think that after the Afghanistan and Iraq fiascos someone on the policymaking team would tell the fantasists to dial-it-down a bit. But, no. The Obama claque is just as eager to try their hand at regime change as their predecessors, the Bushies. This time the bullseye is on Ukraine, the home of the failed Orange Revolution, where US NGOs fomented a populist coup that brought down the government and paved the way for years of social instability, economic hardship and, eventually, a stronger alliance with Moscow.</p>
<p align="left">That sure worked out well, didn’t it? One can only wonder what Obama has in mind for an encore.</p>
<p align="left">Let’s cut to the chase: The US still clings to the idea that it can dominate the world with its ham-fisted military (that hasn’t won a war in 60 years) its scandalized Intel agencies, its comical Rambo-style “Special Ops” teams, and its oh-so-brilliant global strategists who think the days of the nation-state will soon be over hastening the onset of the glorious New World Order. Right. Ukraine is a critical part of that pipe dream, er, strategy which is why the US media puts demonstrations in Kiev in the headlines while similar protests in the US are consigned to the back pages just below the dog food ads. In any event, the crisis is likely to intensify in the months ahead as Washington engages in a no-holds-barred tug-o-war with Moscow over the future of civilization.</p>
<p align="left">For bigwig strategists, like Zbigniew Brzezinski, Ukraine is a war that Washington must win to maintain its position as the world’s only superpower. As he sees it, the US must establish outposts throughout Eurasia to diminish Russia’s influence, control China, and capitalize off the new century’s fastest growing region. Here’s how Brzezinski sums it up in Foreign Affairs in an article titled “A Geostrategy for Eurasia”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“America’s emergence as the sole global superpower now makes an integrated and comprehensive strategy for Eurasia imperative…Eurasia is home to most of the world’s politically assertive and dynamic states. All the historical pretenders to global power originated in Eurasia. The world’s most populous aspirants to regional hegemony, China and India, are in Eurasia, as are all the potential political or economic challengers to American primacy…</p>
<p align="left">Eurasia is the world’s axial supercontinent. A power that dominated Eurasia would exercise decisive influence over two of the world’s three most economically productive regions, Western Europe and East Asia. A glance at the map also suggests that a country dominant in Eurasia would almost automatically control the Middle East and Africa…</p>
<p align="left">What happens with the distribution of power on the Eurasian landmass will be of decisive importance to America’s global primacy and historical legacy.” ( “<a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/53392/zbigniew-brzezinski/a-geostrategy-for-Eurasia">A Geostrategy for Eurasia</a>”, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Foreign Affairs, 1997)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Okay, so the not-so-subtle Brzezinski is telling US policymakers that if they want to rule the world, they’ve got to take over Eurasia. That’s pretty clear. It’s the Great Game all over again and Ukraine is one of the biggest trophies, which is why the US has allied itself to all kinds crackpot, rightwing groups that are stirring up trouble in Kiev. It’s because Washington will stop at nothing to achieve its objectives. Of course, there’s nothing new about any of this. The US frequently supports violent, far-right organizations if their interests coincide. Here’s a little background on the topic from Eric Draitser in an article in CounterPunch titled “Ukraine and the Rebirth of Fascism”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“In an attempt to pry Ukraine out of the Russian sphere of influence, the US-EU-NATO alliance has, not for the first time, allied itself with fascists. Of course, for decades, millions in Latin America were disappeared or murdered by fascist paramilitary forces armed and supported by the United States. The mujahideen of Afghanistan, which later transmogrified into Al Qaeda, also extreme ideological reactionaries, were created and financed by the United States for the purposes of destabilizing Russia. And of course, there is the painful reality of Libya and, most recently Syria, where the United States and its allies finance and support extremist jihadis against a government that has refused to align with the US and Israel. There is a disturbing pattern here that has never been lost on keen political observers: the United States always makes common cause with right wing extremists and fascists for geopolitical gain.” (<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/01/29/ukraine-and-the-rebirth-of-fascism/">Ukraine and the rebirth of Fascism</a>“, Eric Draitser, CounterPunch)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Death squads here, jihadis there; what difference does it make to the big shots in Washington?</p>
<p align="left">Not much, apparently.</p>
<p align="left">But, wait, what’s all this talk about the US being on the side of anti-Semites and fascists in Ukraine? Is that true?</p>
<p align="left">It sure looks that way. In fact, there was a funny story in the World Socialist Web Site about Assistant Secretary of State Victoria “Fuck the EU” Nuland which shows how far these people will go to achieve their objectives. In this case, Nuland, who — according to the WSWS — is “the grand-daughter of Jewish immigrants who fled to America to escape pogroms in Tsarist Russia”…was seen “handing out cookies in Maidan square to Svoboda thugs who venerate the mass murderers of Hitler’s SS.” (“<a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/02/10/pers-f10.html">Leaked phone call on Ukraine lays bare Washington’s gangsterism</a>“, Bill Van Auken, World Socialist Web Site)</p>
<p align="left">Nice, eh? So Vickie was having a little snacktime with guys who’d probably shove a knife in her back if they were given half a chance. That’s what you call dedication. By the way, Nuland’s “husband is Robert Kagan, the right-wing foreign policy pundit who served as the founding chairman of the Project for a New American Century, the neo-conservative Washington think tank that played a key role in the political and ideological preparation for the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan.”</p>
<p align="left">The fact that Obama and Co. are directly involved in this latest would-be coup, doesn’t surprise anyone. According to a recent poll conducted by the All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center, “almost a half (45%) of Russian citizens think that protests in Ukraine have been provoked by Western special services.” By “special services” we presume the survey’s authors mean US Intel agencies and US-funded NGOs which have a long history of poking their noses in other country’s affairs. Here’s a statement by Rep Ron Paul in 2004 to the US House International Relations Committee which helps to throw a little light on the issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“It is clear that a significant amount of US taxpayer dollars went to support one candidate in Ukraine. …. What we do not know, however, is just how much US government money was spent to influence the outcome of the Ukrainian election.</p>
<p align="left">Dozens of organizations are granted funds under the PAUCI program alone, (Poland-America-Ukraine Cooperation Initiative, which is administered by the US-based Freedom House.) and this is only one of many programs that funneled dollars into Ukraine. We do not know how many millions of US taxpayer dollars the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) sent to Ukraine through NED’s National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute. Nor do we know how many other efforts, overt or covert, have been made to support one candidate over the other in Ukraine.</p>
<p align="left">That is what I find so disturbing: there are so many cut-out organizations and sub-grantees that we have no idea how much US government money was really spent on Ukraine, and most importantly how it was spent.” (“<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2004/12/ron-paul/what-has-ned-done-in-ukraine/">What has the NED done in Ukraine?</a>“, Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The fact is, the USG gives away tons of money to all types of shady groups who carry out their agenda. As far as Ukraine is concerned, we actually have a better idea of the money that’s been spent than Paul thinks. Check out this video of Nuland addressing various industry groups and admitting that, “Since the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1991, the United States supported the Ukrainians in the development of democratic institutions and skills in promoting civil society and a good form of government…We have invested more than 5 billion dollars to help Ukraine to achieve these and other goals.” (“<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article37599.htm">Washington’s cloned female warmongers</a>“, Finian Cunningham, Information Clearinghouse)</p>
<p align="left">5 billion smackers to topple a democratically-elected government in Ukraine while 8 million Americans still can’t find a damn job in the US. That tells you a lot about Obama’s priorities, doesn’t it?</p>
<p align="left">Last week’s fiasco surrounding Nuland’s leaked phone conversation has clarified what’s really going on behind the scenes. While the media has focused on Nuland’s obscenity, (“Fuck the EU”) it’s the other parts of the conversation that grabbed our attention. Here’s a brief summary by the WSWS’s Bill Van Auken:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">“The call (exposes) the criminal and imperialist character of US policy in Ukraine …What the tape makes clear, is that Washington is employing methods of international gangsterism, including violence, to effect a political coup aimed at installing a regime that is fully subordinate to US geo-strategic interests…</p>
<p align="left">The precise goal of US efforts is to shift political power into the hands of a collection of Western-aligned Ukrainian oligarchs who enriched themselves off of the private appropriation—theft—of state property carried out as part of the Stalinist bureaucracy’s dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In doing so, it aims to turn Ukraine into a US imperialist beachhead on the very border of Russia, whose territory it also wants to divide and subjugate to neocolonial status as part of its drive to assert American hegemony throughout the strategic landmass of Eurasia…</p>
<p align="left">Nuland makes clear that behind the scenes, Washington is dictating which leaders of the opposition…should enter the government to swing it behind Washington and what role the others will play…”(“<a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/02/10/pers-f10.html">Leaked phone call on Ukraine lays bare Washington’s gangsterism</a>“, Bill Van Auken, World socialist Web Site)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Same old, same old. Like we said earlier, there’s nothing new here, nothing at all. All the blabber about “democracy” is just public relations crappola. It means nothing. US elites want to trim Moscow’s wings, set up shop in Eurasia, control China’s growth, be a bigger player in the continent’s oil and natural gas markets, export its financial services model, and make as much money as possible in the 21st century’s hottest market, Asia. It’s all about profits. Profits and power.</p>
<p align="left">But then, you probably knew that already.</p>

			<p><img alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/images.jpeg" /><strong>There is now a New American War.  It is inside America. It is called</strong> <strong>the “War on Terror”. The enemy is YOU!<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It is a staged, Phony War that has been created by the International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS).</p>
<p><strong>This New War on Terror has an enemy. That enemy is the American People, You and Me.</strong></p>
<p>Every Military Force needs an enemy.<strong> </strong>Without an ongoing or perpetual war, the War profiteers quickly go bankrupt.</p>
<p><strong>In order to keep their profit stream going from war, war-profiteers need to create successive new wars or a significant threat of impending war.</strong></p>
<p>Creating pretexts for these much needed wars is very hard work and quite expensive too. But war is a business, a very big business, and war-profiteers need to invest big money to make even more in return.</p>
<p><strong>Members of Congress must be bought, and top Generals and Admirals of the Military High Command too.</strong></p>
<p>This costs a great deal of hard cold cash, but that’s okay because the IZCS gets all it needs from fat US foreign aid to Israel, fat contracts with Israeli Defense providers, and fat donations from those wealthy zionist businessmen that the IZCS manipulates, guilts or shakes down.</p>
<p>At this point, a select group of 70,000 K-Street Lobbyists go to work distributing funds to get elected officials on Board. The several select Generals and Admirals are handled more covertly.</p>
<p>If this is not enough revenue to pay off the necessary officials, the IZCS gets the rest directly from its private Central Banksters who can create all the money they want digitally, anytime they want, and give it to tribal brothers or anyone else, anytime they want.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course the key thing here is a significant portion of these fat revenues are kicked back to the corrupt, bought and owned members of Congress who voted for them, and to select top Generals and Admirals of the High Military Command who support the IZCS intended proxy wars by America on their behalf.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under President Obama’s Administration, for whatever reasons, the High Military Command has not been willing to take payoffs and favors and has not been blackmail-able by the IZCS.</p>
<p>[Note: this is a long article and one option is to read the caps first and then any areas you are interested in if you have time]</p>
<p><strong>Here is the new game in the so-called American Defense Industry. </strong> It is a stateside game and it involves magically transforming any and all innocent, Constitutional, law-abiding citizens into Domestic Dissenters, aka “Domestic Terrorists” or something close enough to declare war on “Potential Domestic Dissenters, aka “Potential Domestic Terrorists”. This is an occult, alchemical symbolic processing of the American people (aka “we the people”) into an defined domestic enemy that can be waged war against on many fronts–phone and email tapping, massive spying and infiltration of all domestic groupings, even neighborhood coffee parties or local church charities–you name it, everything.</p>
<p><strong>This new redefinition of normal law-abiding Americans into “Enemies of the State” and its internal security apparatus</strong> as a threat to national security <strong>IS</strong> a magical conversion or transformation of the normal American Society, mainstream law abiding America, into a huge domestic national security market. This is all an horrendous BIG LIE.</p>
<p>Actually the real situation is just the opposite–it is the USG and specifically the Fusion Centers and the Department of Homeland Security run by perverts and enemies of “we the people” that are the real risk to the true and actual national security of America the republic and to all honest, law abiding, Constitutional Americans. And the USG and DHS and Fusion Center officials are nothing less than world class criminals committing both High Treason and Sedition against America the Republic. The USG has been hijacked and is being run by those who have turned everything upside down.</p>
<p>This redefinition of course involves placing cameras and microphones on almost every street corner in the light-poles and pulsed beam psychotronic generators in many street lamps, turned on full power during rush hour to sedate and subdue the populace in order to keep the masses in line.</p>
<p><strong>Some say that the new Chairman of the JCS, General Martin Dempsey, is a breath of fresh air, a real American Patriot</strong> who honors his Oath to defend the US Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>So far, General Dempsey has resisted major efforts to coerce him to support and engage in any new major American Mideast Air and Ground invasion (another American proxy war for Israel).</p>
<blockquote><p>And many believe that our new Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel is another America-firster who takes his oath to defend the US Constitution seriously also.</p></blockquote>
<p>JCS Chairman Dempsey’s independence and commitment to America on this matter has elevated him to the status of a “rock star” in the view of many who appreciate his steadfastness, and he is regarded as a true America-firster.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some experts view JCS Chairman Dempsey’s integrity and commitment to America the Republic as a major turning point, signaling the realization by the High Military Command that the 9/11 attacks were an inside-job, a false-flag attack run by the IZCS with the help of several Traitors within the USAF, JCS, and NORAD.</p>
<p>And that it also signals a shocking realization, for the first time, that most of the Institutions of the USG have been deeply hijacked by the IZCS and their Cutouts have included the Bush Cabal which is now struggling to maintain a thin hold on power.(1)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Obviously, Chairman Dempsey’s and Defense Secretary Hagel’s steadfast resistance to being manipulated by the IZCS</strong> into fighting another major Mideast ground and Air proxy war for Israel appears to be driving the IZCS to desperation.  So far these America-firsters are holding fast against any and all IZCS manipulations and pressure and doing an excellent job staying on course.</p>
<p>The IZCS knows that unless it gets another American proxy war in the Mideast for Israel, they are finished.  They also know that if the American masses ever start finding out that 9/11 was planned and controlled by those owned by the IZCS, they are done too.</p>
<p><strong>Actually the 9/11 attacks of the IZCS were in a sense a going-for-broke gamble</strong> of everything they have against the House (America the Republic). There is a very strong new American Populism which is emerging rapidly as a spontaneous by-product of the world-wide Internet and the Alternative news it carries, which provides truth to the masses for the first time.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Top insiders know all the names of who did the 9/11 inside-job false-flag attacks and are are ready to testify</strong> if an independent prosecutor is assigned and a special Grand Jury is called, and appropriate  immunity agreements are offered for “coming clean”. At least one, Steve Pieczenik, MD, Ph.D., (former Assistant Secretary of State and father of many deep cover black ops, and also the main character in many Tom Clancy books) has already gone public and named names and has said he is willing to testify in a Federal Court as to who did it.(2) Obviously Dr. Pieczenik is another great American Hero.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Some top insiders close to to the High Command have suggested that America is so deeply hijacked by the IZCS</strong> that it will take some years of the actions of high officials like JCS Chairman General Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to turn the tide and neutralize the rampant influence peddling of the IZCS over almost every member of Congress and many officials in the Department of Justice and the Alphabets.</p>
<blockquote><p>Certainly the Department of Homeland Security is now recognized as a major IZCS beach-head inside America and part of a long term plan to establish a foreign controlled IZCS neo-Bolshevik military force inside America to Tyrannize, wage war against, and eventually serially mass murder most Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why some top insiders refer to DHS as the New American Gestapo or Stasi.  Some see it now morphing into a New Red Cheka mass-murder machine for dispensing Bolshevik-style Red Terror and mass-murder to Americans.</p>
<p><strong>The Cold War was a great boon to the defense Industry even though it never went hot anywhere but Korea and Vietnam, which were limited to prevent an all out nuclear exchange.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The first Iraq War (aka the Gulf War) under Bush1 resulted from covert trickery using Kuwaiti cross drilling, which was reported to Saddam Hussein by April Glaspie, who convinced him that the USG wouldn’t care if he invaded Kuwait to stop the theft of his oil from his main oil field. The second Mideast war was an Invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan to get even with the alleged perps who supposedly did the 9/11 attacks, but actually never were involved at all.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>President Obama is now unwilling to deploy American troops in any major new American land war or massive air bombardment campaign in the Mideast.</strong> Nor is the current US Military High Command willing to allow it at this time. In order to appease the so-called Defense Industry and their lobbyists, he has apparently deployed numerous teams of “special operators” and mercenaries but these have been fighting terrorists supported by America, a self-defeating exercise.</p>
<p>He has also continued to deploy drones with air-to-ground missiles to mass murder numerous innocent women, children and non-combatants. All these Mideast and African wars are illegal, unConstitutional, undeclared and unprovoked.  They have been sold to the American People and the Congress based on the BIG LIE that they are preemptive strikes necessary to prevent any more 9/11 attacks.</p>
<blockquote><p>The need for preemptive strikes to prevent terrorist attacks inside America is an obvious lie for numerous reasons. Anyone who examines all the available evidence on 9/11, including the BBC live TV announcement by Jane Standley that WTC7 fell to the ground 20 minutes before it happened (due to top MI-6 control officers forgetting about American Daylight savings time (too much personal coke use perhaps?).(3)</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, if DHS’s main concern is spying on normal Americans who dissent and crushing them because DHS believes they are “domestic terrorists or “potential Domestic terrorists” or “lone wolf” spontaneously emerging domestic terrorists, this obviates any lies about the need for preemptive foreign attacks. The reason?  Because DHS now claims that the emergence of these ordinary lone wolf domestic terrorists inside America is a spontaneous phenomenon, as well as a completely independent problem that has nothing to do with foreign terrorists in the Mideast.</p>
<p>And beside DHS allows open borders, “sanctuary cities” where illegals can not be checked for legal immigration status, given traffic tickets for minor violations, and must be granted drivers licenses and social security cards without any proof of residency. Plus, thousands of Mideast Immigrants are allowed in to America when there is already a shortage of jobs, and the Muslim Brotherhood is invited into the White House to meet with President Obama.(4)</p>
<blockquote><p>It is obvious that as the major American Defense Contractors who are either owned or controlled by the IZCS have realized that American Mideast war efforts are waning and have worked hard to create their phony War on Terror, first in foreign countries and now in America.</p>
<p>They have worked hard to generate massive public fear in reaction to the 9/11 attacks in order to engender public support and vast expenditures of taxpayer dollars for a large national security market and internal security apparatus, like the Fusion Centers and its specialized assassination teams disguised as corporate or political protection squads, the DHS and the TSA with its Vipr Teams.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This phony, staged War on Terror has been very craftily engineered</strong> to be an unending war that will assure perpetual war profits for Defense Contractors and a perpetual supply of artificially created enemies inside America to feed that war. How is this possible you might ask?</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/youareterror2.jpg" width="300" height="145" />This new War on Terror has been socially engineered</strong> to provide a continual stream of degradations and provocations against the average American, provoking many in a never-ending stream to resist, and causing them to be labeled dissenters.</p>
<p>Once they have been labeled dissenters they are put on a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Main Core Terror Watch List, which top insiders know is a targeted assassination list for later eradication of all Freedom-loving Americans who want to restore the American Constitutional Republic.</p>
<blockquote><p>At present the Main Core list has over ten million Americans on it, and it is growing every day with thousands of new additions. Get a ticket for a driving offense or any arrest (even if later proven innocent) and it is highly likely you will be placed on this Main Core Terror Watch and Assassination list.</p>
<p>If you have a prior drug arrest many years ago or any arrest, it is likely you have already been placed on this list. If a USG web troll or fusion Center Officer comes across any patriotic postings or anything they consider subversive like the East German Stasi, that poster will likely be placed on this list.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Over time these provocations are designed to result in a continuing stream of America dissenters</strong> that want to take their Republic back from the zionist hijackers and will meet DHS tyranny and force with the like. Any and all Dissenters are now being defined as “Enemies of the State”.</p>
<blockquote><p>And anyone who wants to restore the American Republic will also be defined as a “Domestic Terrorist”. DHS is a terrorist group, hand assembled by American/Israeli dual citizen Traitors and is designed to tyrannize, capture and eventually be deployed against Americans to serially mass murder them.  This is why they have been called the New American Gestapo of the Neo-Bolshevik Red Cheka Terror Machine.</p>
<p>If you were a Ron Paul supporter or a Libertarian, you are likely on the Main Core list. If NSA routine scans of any and all of your digital emissions and have picked up enough key trigger words, then you have perhaps already been placed on the List. After all, Marcus Wolfe the former head of the East German Stasi, a vicious torturer and murder of innocent Germans, was hired as a USG consultant to set up DHS two years before he died.(5)<strong><br />

<p>Note the recent admission by US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia that it is without question that the Prison Camps now being built by the USG will eventually be used just like they were in WW2 when innocent Japanese Citizens were wrongly captured, completely asset stripped and placed in USG Prison Camps. (6)</p>
<p><strong>President Eisenhower was an insider placed in position by the Rockefellers</strong> early in his Military career and eventually propelled into the Presidency by them. But even Ike started being bothered by strong pangs of Patriotism and became alarmed at the undue influence of the Military Industrial complex over Congress. In his final public speech as President, he delivered a warning to Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Ike never imagined that the Israelis would serve as the chief action agent for the City of London zionists</strong> and would eventually hijack, buy off, bribe, compromise or honey-trap almost every single member of Congress and also use their vast Central Bankster and manipulated donor funds to hijack almost all American defense and Intel contractors and American communication companies, many of which have been moved to Israel or have been located there in the first place.</p>
<p>Originally his speech included the phrase Military, Industrial, Congressional Complex.  He took out “Congressional” after his political aides informed him that this could end up harming the Republican Party. When he referred to “Military” in the phrase “Military Industrial Complex”, he was actually thinking of the whole new peacetime defense Industry, which was driving the Military Industrial Complex and formation of a permanent armament industry.</p>
<p><strong>Ike became concerned that this permanent armament industry could assert undue influence</strong> on the American political process and could hijack American society and harm its spiritual character.</p>

<p><strong>Disarming the public is a key goal of the IZCS</strong> for everyone in America but them and their stooges at the DHS and the Alphabets or their militarized police now trained by the ADL.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hitler-300x216.jpg" width="300" height="216" />Many Police Chiefs are taken to Israel on all-paid Anti-Terror training Junkets where they drink the Kool-aid and are subjected to some of the most sophisticated Psi powered and Psychotronic mind-kontrol ever deployed. In years past, many were given lavish gifts and provided personal escorts of their age and choice. Perhaps this practice continues?</p>
<p>Any Tyrannical Government must always get rid of we the people’s guns in order to be able to stay in power and concentrate it. A major goal of any tyranny, like what we have in IZCS-hijacked America now, is to gain maximum power by eliminating (as in serial mass-murdering) all political opponents and dissenters. Doubt this? Then check world history the last couple of hundred years.</p>
<p>The USG and DHS is now ramping up the militarization of the Police of American Cities and Suburbs under DOD Program 1033 under the ‘Transfer of Excess Military Property to Local Police Program”.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a video from ‘TheLipTV’, “Over the last decade, we have seen over 5,000 people killed by police in the United States,” when “4,489 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the Iraq war. Since 9-11, you are 29-times more likely to be killed by a police officer than you are by a terrorist.”(7)</p></blockquote>
<p>Most local urban and suburban police departments have been “militarized”, that is, received heavy armament including armored cars, MP5 and M-16 fully-automatic machine guns, grenades, grenade launchers and ballistic shields.</p>
<p><strong>We the people are the new enemy of the militarized police. </strong>The police were set up to “protect and serve”, but their new mission is to wage war against “we the people” on behalf of the IZCS and the ADL.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Every military force must have a designated enemy. The common American is the new enemy of the now militarized police in their new war against Americans on behalf of the IZCS and the ADL.</p>
<p>Whether they realize it or not, the ADL has trained most police to view most Americans (we the people) as the enemy of the police and the Nation State. Ever attended a police training seminar put on by the ADL? Often they hide who really is running it. It’s the biggest bunch of twisted, sick paranoid crap one can ever imagine, and all designed to make police trigger-happy murderers of any citizen who questions their authority in any way or questions any detainment or arrest. Yes, ADL training is a crafty set of lies that produces trigger-happy cops who believe there is a domestic terrorist hiding behind every bush who want to murder them so the police cannot go home to their family at night.</p>
<p>This paranoid belief system will eventually produce this result as a self-fulfilling prophecy, as police tyranny and trigger-happy police continue to murder the innocent and use grossly excessive force for minor offenses. Almost all police abuse of the citizen is delivered “for your own safety”, when that is another big lie.  It is done for the arrogance and authority complex of the police officer–an artifact of over 25 years of ADL training for your local police, who have almost all sold out to the feds in order to get military weapons and gear.  All in return for signing over jurisdiction to DHS and the Feds.</p>
<p>Police are instructed to “charge up” anyone who questions them in any way, and any slight hesitation must be met with false charges of assault and/or battery towards the officer. Officers are told, an arrestee can beat the rap, but they cannot get out of the “ride” (i.e. the arrest and hassle of it.) They are taught that this deters deviance and crime, when actually it provokes the American people to hate police officers.</p>
<p><strong>The new militarized police have one new main function.</strong>  It is to continually provoke law-abiding, honest citizens with acts of selfishness and tyranny in order to “role force” them to act out so that “punishment” can be delivered.  The goal, especially with inner urban kids is to make sure they are sold all the drugs they want, in order to dirty them up and get them into the system for life. Big prisons are a private business–a very big business–and quotas or guaranteed imprisonment rates are in place to reduce costs.</p>
<p>Since the IZCS is actually functioning as a neo-Bolshevik political block with East German Stasi and Nazi undertones, this reveals the actual goal of DHS–to serially mass-murder all American dissenters and political opponents. Doubt this?  Then consider the purchase of over 2 Billion 40 Caliber hollow-point rounds and 7,000 M-16 fully-automatic (real assault rifles, not the mere look-a-like AR-15) and thousands of armored vehicles and armored booths, raised spy-towers and grenade launchers.(8) Many of these armored vehicles have been given to local police who have Police Chiefs who are Traitors to America the Republic in exchange for complete submission to Federal Jurisdiction of DHS.</p>
<p><strong>Some of these traitors are just stupid and overly impressed by Feds or DHS Spooks</strong>, others have been paid off in very large cash donations (hundreds of thousands of USD in military duffel bags, untraceable CIA drug profits. Some have been sexually compromised by Pedophile or Honey Traps and then blackmailed into submission. Some have succumbed after being threatened or having their families threatened. This is the lowest scum-bag manipulation (aka Humint) ever deployed, and it is everyday stock and trade for the IZCS, the world’s biggest sexual compromisers, and pedophile and sex-slave operators.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons of History: </strong>Any serious study of History quickly shows that war is a vehicle for a nation’s leaders to maintain control over their nation-states. The infamous Iron Mountain Report gave an inside glimpse of how the super-elite criminal Psychopaths running America thought about the need for ongoing war or a suitable state crisis to unify the society and solidify their control over society.</p>
<p><strong>Wars are craftily engineered </strong>by criminal super-elites who rule nation-states and their advisers. There are various, crafty ways for a nation’s leaders to covertly start wars. The well-established standby is to stage False-Flag attacks and then wage war on the nation state or entity that you have framed for the attack that you did.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another way to create a terrorist with a long and successful track record is to capture abandoned children in Mideast Countries, provide for their daily needs, while mind-kontrolling them to become terrorists with psychotic suicidal delusions of revenge toward what has been identified to them as their religious enemy which needs destruction to please their god.</p>
<p>The British, the Israelis, and the Saudi are experts at this, and American Taxpayers have unknowingly provided a large portion of the funding for this. One trick well known among intel insiders is the practice of acts of terror against the nation of the mind-kontrolled children to create an enemy for them to later attack in revenge.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Lots of American Taxpayer dollars were covertly dispensed to create and finance terrorists for future Mideast wars.</strong> American Intel has spent a great deal of money paying others,  such as the Israelis, to do this. Otherwise, American Intel has not been very successful themselves.  Their only real success is their arming, funding and training of the Mexican Drug Cartels and the training and deployment of the disgusting mass-murdering death squads in Central and South America, who murdered over one hundred thousand innocent women, children and young men.(9)</p>
<p><strong>The 9/11 attacks were an inside job by the USAF and the IZCS.</strong> The staged Gladio-style False-Flag attack was the choice selected for the attack on the Twin Towers in NYC and the Pentagon in Washington, DC, on 9-11-2001. This attack was done by the USAF, under the authority of a zionist-controlled Criminal Cabal inside the JCS and the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).(10)</p>
<blockquote><p>The 9/11 attack was planned, set up and run by NeoCon top Policy-Makers, Israeli Intel and their stateside Sayanims, utilizing a small criminal cabal inside the USAF, NORAD and the JCS. These are facts that can no longer be disputed by any reasonable person who has examined all the available evidence.</p>
<p>And it is exceedingly clear to any reasonable person who examines the pre-announcement of WTC-7 destruction that the whole attack was pre-scripted in London and Israel, and that WTC-7 was wired in advance with conventional demolition charges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Typically, it takes a considerable amount of time and labor to wire up a building, which suggests complete access at the security level.  This means that since it was a federalized building, with CIA and NYC Emergency Center occupants, building security had to be involved one way or another. And now that it has been proved that WTC-7 was wired up beforehand and demo’ed on 9-11, this means the Twin Towers had to have been pre-wired, too.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>The War on Terror is obviously a Phony.</strong> But it has been the greatest boon to the American Defense Complex ever, with many times more net American Taxpayer dollars spent on this war than any other war in history, including WW2 or the Vietnam War.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to establish a war is to create and fund so-called foreign terrorist groups.</strong> This is a costly exercise that take years and can involve as much work as fighting a war.  Yes, creating terrorist groups is very hard and expensive work.</p>
<blockquote><p>But enemies for necessary wars can be created if you have the technological help of a nation that has hundreds of years experience in creating its own enemies. This nation is the City of London (Financial District), a separate nation state like the Vatican, located within England.</p>
<p>There is a reason England has been referred to as “Perfidious Albion” for centuries. They have been known for their ability to instigate chaos inside nations they want to control by their standard well-developed strategy of “Divide and Conquer”. They are experts at creating long term provocations between different nations that have competing economic interests.</p>
<p>They do this in order to establish a beach-head from which to control the removal of natural resources and accrued wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember the Opium Wars</strong> (Boxer Rebellions) where England brought opiate addiction to China as a covert act of war in order to recover all the silver and gold paid to import Tea, spices and silk from China? This was low intensity (covert) warfare that twice led to a short hot war.</p>
<p><strong>The creation of the nation state Israel was created to serve as a long term provocation for numerous Mideast perpetual wars.</strong> This is why the Balfour Declaration was made, why the Nazi sent the “low Jews” to the labor camps, while the “High Jews” were able to either emigrate elsewhere or become collaborators like George Soros.</p>
<p>This is why the City of London created the New Israel and took land away from the Palestinians to set up a nation of Khazarian Judaic converts (aka “fake Hebrews”), a racially paranoid group mind-kontrolled to believe the delusion that they were of ancient Abrahamic Hebrew Blood.</p>
<blockquote><p>The IZCS believes in preemptive strikes against Goyim and their institutions. Judaics have also been mind-kontrolled by Zionists (many of whom are not Judaics at all) to believe that they must hijack the American political system to preemptively crush Christianity and American Goyim Culture.</p>
<p>And that if they didn’t succeed in this, they would be persecuted again, just like what they call the “holocaust”–translated from Old English as “a fiery sacrifice”.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/38783-israel-killing-machine2.jpg" width="276" height="248" /><strong>This philosophy of striking first</strong> and eliminating the Goyim to prevent another “holocaust” from ever occurring” is a Bolshevik ideology based on the “End Justifies the Means”.</p>
<p>This paranoid strike-first obsession will produce push back and persecution eventually, thus serving as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Of course the Zionists who control Talmudic, Noahide Judaism know that the 6-million-dead figure is untrue, because this had appeared in the late 1800′s andearly 1900′s in Judaic literature long before the work camps of WW2.</p>
<p><strong>New Genetics research exposes a vast, paranoid race-based delusion.</strong> Recent Johns Hopkins genetic research has shown conclusively that approximately 80% of the Palestinians are of Hebrew (Abrahamic) bloodlines, and approximately 90% of Judaic converts living in greater Israel are not of ancient Hebrew (Abrahamic) bloodlines. Thus, the world’s greatest anti-Semites appear to be Israelis who have stolen Palestinian land and continue to do so against all UN rulings and International Law.</p>
<p><strong>The nation of Israel was set up as the private nation state and Tribal Intel front for the City of London Zionist private Central Banksters</strong>, to serve as a beach-head to control the production and distribution of Mideast oil. This delusion that the Khazarian Judaic converts were God’s Chosen People (ancient Hebrews from the Ten Tribes) was then en-cultured into these Judaics who were sent to Palestine and armed so they could use terrorism to expand their region of control.</p>
<p>Greater Israel has no real boundaries and is ever expedient, as Israeli militants keep taking land and murdering unarmed Palestinians.</p>
<blockquote><p>A serious spell, a racial delusion of superiority has been cast on many Judaics no matter where they live, but especially so among those living in greater Israel, where the Luciferian Hex Flag flies. Whether true or not, the flag signifies the merger of demonic fallen angel Beast-Bloodlines from above, bred with Human female bloodlines below.</p>
<p>If we accept this Hex Flag at face value, does this mean that the top Zionists running the IZCS are perhaps alien/human hybrids, or at least claim to be in their own secret ceremonies that Stew Webb has exposed numerous times in articles and radio appearances over many years?<strong><br />
</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It is obvious that the IZCS has hijacked the US Department of State and the US Military Defense Complex as well as Congress. Listen to what Kay Griggs had to say about this.  She was married to a top USM officer and mind-kontrolled “wetboy” who became out of control and beat her and then tried to have her shut up. He and/or his controllers serious stalked and harassed Kay Griggs for years.</p>
<p>She went to live with Sarah McClendon for protection and was interviewed by Pastor Rick Strawcutter, which probably raised her profile so much that it saved her life.  Kay is another Great American Hero and is a courageous standup person, one of the best you could ever meet anytime, anyplace. If you get a chance, be sure and listen to her 8-hour video affidavit with Pastor Rick Strawcutter, who is another Great American Hero. You will be amazed and angered at who has been running the USG and the Military.(11)</p>
<p>Kay’s video affidavit is packed with insider secrets known only by top Intel insiders. How much do you want to know about what is really going on in the background? How much do you dare to pull the curtain back to expose the Wizard Of Oz (as in Ounce)? You will need a great deal of courage to handle what Kay Griggs reveals. By the way, a great deal of her testimony has been cross-corroborated by experts.  Any errors she makes are minor and not directly related to her main claims.</p>

<p><strong>Two sides of the same coin:</strong> Of course those on the inside of the Ruling Cabal know that Nazi-ism and Zionism are two sides of the same coin and run by the City of London Central bank controllers. This entity is the Old Black Nobility (OBN), which prefers to stay in the background.</p>
<p><strong>The IZCS controls Private Central Fiat, Fractional Reserve Banking:</strong> This reality that the IZCS owns and controls private Central Banking means that they have access to and can utilize Babylonian Money-Magick to make the money they need to control the USG officials and Congress from nothing.  This access provides vast sums of money in seemingly endless quantities.  Thus, they have access to all the cash they need to buy, own, compromise or blackmail almost every single Congressman/woman and Senator in America.</p>
<p>The serious down-side of this system of Babylonian Money-Magick is that it is based on fiat or fake-money with nothing but debt behind it. Actually this debt is imaginary, but has a stranglehold on most of the members of the societies it has hijacked. But it cannot go on without catastrophic readjustments, which will occur at some point.</p>
<blockquote><p>A worldwide Web of Debt: The private Central Banksters in America have been so adept and successful at extracting wealth in America and all over the world, replacing it with debt, that nearly the whole world is now engulfed in extreme debt.</p>
<p>And this debt has now reached the point it cannot be paid off. This of course is the IZCS’s age-old plan which will result in massive chaos that engulfs the world and destroys all social systems, family systems, sex roles, and systems of government.</p>
<p>After this destruction of conventional society occurs, it is expected by the IZCS top leadership that a pure Luciferian NWO System will arise from the globalist framework they have put in place.  They expect this NWO System emerging from the ashes to be their Phoenix, like the legendary Phoenix of Greek and Roman mythology.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>All this tidal wave of debt is phony and a big charade. </strong> If all the people of the world unite, nationalize their monetary systems and declare all debt null and void, and if they assign all such debt directly to Central Banksters responsible for creating it, prosperity to “we the people” can return like it did to the Colonists who left England.</p>
<p><strong>Babylonian Money-Magick has been used to create a debt based economy.</strong>  It does this by producing “onerous usury” and allows the easy transformation of “all the money created from nothing which is worth nothing at face value” into the vast amounts of ever-increasing wealth.  This wealth–fiat money–is covertly stripped from the common man these Banksters provide the money for and use as a means to extract real value and wealth from.</p>
<p>The Zionist IZCS vehicle used to gain control over almost every single member of Congress and to buy, compromise and control almost every top USG official and Judge, is the 70,000+ K Street Lobbyists, AIPAC and others who distribute the money to their marks, often through campaign contributions, cash to offshore accounts, and various other expensive luxury perks, such as ridiculously high honorariums for meaningless propaganda speeches.</p>
<p><strong>And AIPAC, the ADL, the SPLC and the like are also zionist tools of espionage against America the Republic.</strong></p>
<p>They should all be investigated by the FBI and fully prosecuted and convicted and sentenced for espionage by the Department of Justice. Note, espionage in many cases is a Capital Crime.</p>
<p>If the Rosenbergs were prosecuted, convicted and executed for their espionage against America, why should these IZCS Cutouts go free without identification and full prosecution?</p>
<p>These entities are really Intel fronts for espionage against America the Republic on behalf of the IZCS which includes the City of London zionist Central banksters, Israel, American NeoCons, and Israeli-American dual citizens who have betrayed America, putting Israel first over America.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/maddogisrael-220x320.jpg" width="220" height="320" />Vast Funding for zionist Cutouts.</strong> These entities receive vast funding from the zionist Central Banksters and from the wealthy Judaic businessmen they shake-down or manipulate for large donations by playing on their paranoid tribal delusions.</p>
<p>These tribal delusions are that donations are necessary to prevent excessive antisemitism and future persecutions or “holocausts” by Goyims and Christians.</p>
<p>Many Judaics in America and elsewhere have been en-cultured with the false ideation that Nazi-ism was a Christian phenomena and Christians and Goyim must be destroyed.</p>
<p>This of course this is as far from the truth as possible because Hitler was a British Agent and Nazi-ism was created by the Tavistock Institute and the City of London Central Banksters and a counter-force to the Bolshevism they created and deployed in Russia in 1917.</p>
<blockquote><p>What does the International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS) run out of the City of London through its main Cutouts Israel and the hijacked USG attain? Obviously the IZCS’s unlimited funds and the fact it owns and/or controls almost every member of Congress and most USG officials and Judges, means that the ICS has been able to determine USG Policy.</p>
<p>It can do this because it owns and/or controls all USG top Policy-Makers, most of whom just happen to be outside of the visible USG and within the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously the crimes of the IZCS and their espionage fronts like AIPAC, the ADL, SPLC and the like against the American Republic are far worse than the Rosenbergs.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Listed below are some of the IZCS crimes against America:</strong></p>
<p>1. The NSA and all American Intel has been completely hijacked by the IZCS and all NSA intel data goes directly to Israeli Defense Contractors and Israeli communication Corporations that process all American phone calls and data transmissions. This means that the Five Eyes International Intel System is really a Six Eyes System controlled by Israeli Intel entities and proprietaries.</p>
<p>Thus, America has no real Intel, and Israeli Intel has control over all American politicians, judges and officials by use of this Intel for human compromise, blackmail and sophisticated mind-kontrol operations. Any time factions within American Intel agencies (there are 37 and growing) form opposition to the IZCS, this is readily discovered through Israeli Intel intercepts of NSA raw Intel and actions to neutralize such efforts are quickly deployed–whatever is required.</p>
<p>The conclusion here is that America no longer has any real Intel of its own–none at all–it is all compromised and hijacked by Israeli and City of London Cutouts and contractors.</p>
<p>2. Because the IZCS has hijacked all American Intel directly from NSA feeds, the IZCS has a long history of stealing American intellectual property and providing it to their corporations. The IZCS can also hijack American corporate bids and defeat them repeatedly until many companies go out of business.</p>
<p>3. The IZCS has compromised almost every single member of Congress, US Supreme Court Judges, most Federal, and almost every single USG official and American Intel Director.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TSA-Groping-Glove.jpg" width="260" height="280" />4. The IZCS’s new DHS is a zionist terrorist front, a new Internal American Army that has been deployed against YOU as their NEW ENEMY. The IZCS has created and deployed DHS as the New American Stasi and a New American Neo-Bolshevik Red Cheka. It is controlled by an Israeli-American dual citizen who made millions of USD from selling unshielded X-ray machines to the TSA, which is creating numerous cancer clusters among TSA officers.</p>
<p>5. The principal goal of the IZCS in America is to deploy DHS to tyrannize and degrade Americans and then eventually to start a live “shoot to kill” war against ordinary Americans who organize to take their government back and restore the American Constitutional Republic. This tyranny by DHS is planned to culminate in serial mass-murder of up to 80% of Americans–one way or another.</p>
<p>6. The IZCS has set up and deployed AIPAC, the ADL, the SPLC and others to serve as agents of espionage inside America, to work to destroy its institution of government, dirty up Americans and to destroy the American Family, America’s language borders and culture and to destroy Christianity and Deism in general.</p>
<p>7. The IZCS has hijacked top factions in the CIA, DEA and other American Intel and uses them to traffick illegal narcotics and drugs into America to raise money for deep-cover covert ops.</p>
<p>8. The IZCS has compromised almost every major Urban and Suburban police Department, coercing them to sign secret transfer of jurisdiction agreements giving the Feds, DHS and the Fusion Centers complete jurisdiction in any matter they choose.  In return, they are bribed with “stolen” war materials, machine guns, rounds, armored cars and, even in some cases, grenade launchers.</p>
<p>9. The IZCS has stolen numerous loads of nuclear materials from US DOD contractors and refiners for their Dimona Plant and nuclear storage center.</p>
<p>10. The IZCS has used NSA-provided intel to murder hundreds of witnesses to their crimes and federal Whistleblowers. The rest that they don’t murder are watched and often become victims of targeted harassments, placed on DHS and Fusion Center “Terror Watch Lists”, “No-Fly” Lists and “No work lists”. Take the example of Ronald Reagan’s Secret Agent, the Great American Hero Lee Wanta who was instrumental in “bringing down” the Soviet Union. Lee Wanta has been wrongfully imprisoned, tortured, and endures ongoing harassment.</p>
<p>Or consider Mark Novitsky, another Great American Hero who refused to do wrong and coverup crimes while working for an NSA contractor. Both of these American Heroes have paid a terrible price for obeying the law and for putting the welfare of the American People first.</p>
<p>11. The IZCS has hijacked the America Monetary Production and Distribution System and transformed Americans into debt-slaves, drastically reduced the Middle Class and the standard of living, and done this by massive asset-stripping of American wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p>12. The IZCS has used its Cutouts to debase American culture, take the God of our Founding Fathers out of the schools and institutions where they had certain Bible verses and phrases etched in stone, destroy traditional male and female sex roles, destroy the family, promote sexual perversion, promote promiscuity and sexual irresponsibility and addiction, promote diversity and political correctness and illegal immigration and multi-culturalism.</p>
<p>13. The IZCS has completely compromised all of the Major Mass media, transforming it into a propaganda dispenser for the USG and the Central Banksters which are completely under their control. Thus the Major media is now the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM).</p>
<p>14. The IZCS has hijacked American seed companies and most major food processors and is in the process of deploying sophisticated GMO’s which will, over time, radically increase the death rate of Americans.</p>
<p>15. The IZCS has hijacked Big Pharma and Big medicine and has used it to deploy vaccines containing monkey viruses like SV40 and numerous harmful adjuvants like squalene and aluminum or formaldehyde, as well as so-called preservatives like ethyl mercury.</p>
<p>16. The IZCS has hijacked many large Insurance Companies and used them for its own designated purposes.</p>
<p>17. The IZCS has deployed contract aircraft through their hijacked intel groups like the CIA that are spraying toxic weather and eugenic substances in the atmosphere. They have also been able to covertly add these toxic substances to ordinary jet fuel.</p>
<p>Numerous samples of these substances have been collected by researchers and scientists who have had them analyzed.  What they found were toxic levels of nano-particulized aluminum, barium slats, Hemophilus Influenza, red blood cells, white blood cells, toxic molds, and other strange fiber like substances and compounds.</p>
<p>18. The IZCS has used its vast criminal networks and resources to launder its drug money by buying up large real estate entities and banks and is able to finance almost every new major corporate building with laundered drug money.</p>
<p>19. The IZCS has used a great deal of its money from illegal drug trafficking to build deep underground military bases (DUMBS). Some of these bases are claimed by top insiders to be joint ventures with alien entities and have special genetic labs involved in the development of alien ET/human hybrids.</p>
<p>20. The IZCS is the world’s top Mind-kontroller.  It has used hijacked American Intel and its defense contractors to develop and deploy advanced high technology for psychotronic, direct brain entrainment and sound-based subliminal mind-kontrol.</p>
<p>21. Israel used advanced mind-kontrol on those who accept its all-paid junkets. Visitors end up drinking their special Kool-aide and are hit with sophisticated psychotronics, becoming significantly mind-kontrolled to operate as functional zionists without even being aware of it.</p>
<p>22. The IZCS has created what they call the federal family. They have done this by creating Fusion Centers, the DHS, the TSA and numerous armed (previously unarmed) agencies like the Department of Education. Unduly large salaries and extremely liberal benefits have been provided, as well as a special anointing with authoritarian powers to kill with very little accountability if any, due to the War on Terror.</p>
<p>Many of these federal Family folks have been mind-kontrolled by shoulder-held constant on pulsed beam microwave radios and other highly advanced psychotronics, which increases their tendencies to tyrannize and become violent with the public and minimizes their ability to control violent impulses which may crop up.</p>
<p>23. The IZCS has militarized local police departments and many Sheriff’s departments. Their ADL provides most of the police training and drives a hard line against any public dissent, describing it as “domestic terrorism”. It controls what the Fusion Centers and DHS put out as war propaganda which labels the public as “Domestic Terrorists”.</p>
<p>Here is the first part of one of their confidential lists of Domestic Terrorists or Suspected Domestic Terrorists:  Catholics, Evangelical Christians, Veterans, Libertarians, Constitutionalists, Tax protestors, Gun owners…..These reports of course are pure ADL propaganda lies and complete smear jobs, all intended to provoke police and Federal Family officers to tyrannize and easily become violent with innocent ordinary Americans or anyone who decides to peacefully protest, an American Constitutional Right.</p>
<p>Remember that the operational goal of the top Policy-Makers who are tools of the IZCS is to provoke a full scale shooting war between ordinary Americans and their police and Federal family Members such as DHS.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  The IZCS has hijacked America and has deployed numerous weapons against it now culminating in a phony, staged War on Terror, and if you are an American or live in America, one way or another YOU will soon become THEIR NEW ENEMY. Yes, from here on out if you live in America, you are the designated enemy in this new War On Terror.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the federal family, it is suggested that you read and study up on the Night of the Longknives (Operation Hummingbird) and the various purges under Lenin, Stalin and Mao. Maybe you should reconsider the oath you took to UPHOLD the US Constitution from ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN and DOMESTIC.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now for some good news about all this.  Despite how bleak this all seems it is far from hopeless and American are beginning to wake up in mass. This is due to the worldwide Internet and the massive dissemination and diffusion of the alternative news.  Once facts are published they sink into the hearts of “we the people” with a certain resonance that makes them take hold.</p>
<p>It’s almost instinctive how truth sticks like glue in people hearts and minds and spreads like wildfire all around the Earth. At least 1% of the American population has woken up. Some estimates are 11%. Proof of this is the massive first time gun buyers, the massive sales of high powered handguns, rifles and 12 gauge shotguns and massive ammo sales.</p>
<p>Guns and ammo have literally been flying off the shelves the last several years and there have been serious ammo shortages due to the massive DHS and USG stockpiling of 40 Caliber Hollow Pints and M-16 ammo rounds.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/070213dhs.jpg" width="245" height="210" />Once 12% of the population wakes up a critical mass turning point will spontaneously occur and through various very strange mass societal changes will occurs and new very powerful, unstoppable populism will emerge and the IZCS will be driven out.</p>
<p>If they are stupid enough to take us into a live shooting war, Internal Civil War with mass killing, the public will suffer great losses but the Federal Family will split and it and the IZCS and any of their forces will be defeated.</p>
<p>All wars are always won by what is in the hearts and minds.  In America the American Spirit lives and is getting stronger every day. Soon the foreign filth and their Cutouts run by the Kingpins from City of London and Israel, the perps that have hijacked America, the IZCS, will be completely exposed, stopped, or routed out, one way or another.</p>
<p>And there is good evidence that many retired Intel Cowboys have gone back to work to bring the IZCS Beast down and destroy its grip on American Intel and private Central Banking. Some of the covert operators have long records of success and can create and use numerous different identities.</p>
<p>Many of these Intel Cowboys can use make up and make their own credentials to impersonate officers, draw military and USG paychecks from multiple sources, all at the same time and hack into any computer system anywhere in the USG or American Intel, anywhere anytime. Most of them just did not realize that the IZCS has taken control because of unlimited money provided by zionist Central Banksters and Judaic supporters.</p>
<p>And the best news of all is that more than a few seasoned Intel Cowboys that served the Bush Cabal at its center as well as the IZCS, have now woken up, pulled away from the Bush cabal and are targeting the IZCS with deep cover covert ops that would make your hair stand on end if you were allowed to know.</p>
<p>Some of these Intel Cowboys have now admitted that they were kept so narrowly compartmented that they did not realize the whole picture until the Internet and the numerous Federal Whistle-blowers coming forward and spilling the beans. the simple fact is this, the worldwide Internet and the alternative news it provides spreads truth like a wildfire that cannot be put out even with the application of military force.</p>
<p>The Internet is the New Gutenberg Press, the Achilles Heel of the IZCS.  The Internet will turn out to be the greatest trick in history played on the IZCS by the young men at Drapa.  They sold the Internet to the IZCS and its SSG promising the greatest spying and surveillance system imaginable.  Yes the IZCS got much of what was promised but also a very big hidden surprise which assures their complete exposure and destruction, piece by piece. And this disassembling of the IZCS is already well under way.</p>
<p>The IZCS is now in its death throes and is like a rabid, cornered dog.  That makes it very dangerous for the next year or two until it is completely defanged which is coming. If they use the Samson option which they have been threatening numerous nation-states with (they already used it on japan with the nukes planted in the sea bed and in the security camera on site because Japanese turned against them).</p>
<p>New factions within the Military High Command and the USN have already taken note and are working carefully in the background to defang Dimona by utilizing secret satellite activated back-doors in various hardware circuits.</p>
<p>During the height of the bush Cabal (Bush1) those Intel Cowboys that did know were arrested and jailed on trumped up charges to discredit any possible testimony before Congress or in the courts. Now that many have been informed of what really happened on 9-11-01, they are hopping mad that America has been hijacked and the Constitution and its Bill of Rights, and the Rule of Law has been suppressed and ignored by this world’s largest criminal cabal.</p>
<p>The IZCS attacks on America on 9-11-01 have proved to have been a “going for broke” attempt to build a expanded Israeli in greatest intended form. We now know that it was the greatest and final reckless mistake of Israel so far. Even far worse than Israel’s False-Flag attack on the USS Liberty in their attempt to draw America into a Mideast War at the time which even President Johnson, their crypto Judaic stooge refused.</p>
<p>And now many Americans have finally been informed that the Murrah Building attack as well as the first NYC Twin Towers attack using a 55 drum of cyanide stolen from Louis Champon’s Natural Cherrie Flavoring Plant in Boca Raton, Florida, financed by Dr. Ishan Barbouti, the IZCS Cutout that has died at least three times and always come back to life.</p>
<p>As few know, only the top NeoCons 911 Planners, Dr. Barbouti rose again and came back to life to assist with many of the 9/11 attacks subplots which were designed to provide numerous false leads. A few of the most Patriotic Intel Cowboys who have “traveled” very close to the very “top of the pyramid” now believe that Israel provided the anti-matter positron micro-nukes which were installed in the Twin Towers elevators approximately every ten floors.</p>
<p>Most retired Intel Cowboys had previously thought Israel was a supportive Intel partner but didn’t realize that Israel murdered 135 Americans on the Liberty ship as a False-Flag attack and also murdered another 3,000 humans being in NYC and at the Pentagon on 911, assisted by Traitors within the USAF, NORAD and the JCS.</p>
<p>Now that these Intel Cowboys know the truth, they have woken up and back at work serving America’s true “National Security”. I don’t know exactly what they will do but I would expect some very, very crafty covert moves to expose, drive the IZCS out of America or demo it irreparably if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Urban War Zones are now a reality inside many American cities.</strong></p>
<p>It’s no longer necessary to go to Iraq, Afghanistan or Africa to enter a real war zone and have to fight for your life.</p>
<p>Thanks to massive CIA drug trafficking and American Free-trade Treaties like NAFTA, CAFTA, GATT &amp; WTO, many American inner cities have been transformed into actual war zones.</p>
<p><strong>These inner city war zones are infested with drug gangs that outnumber police and out gun them too.</strong></p>
<p>At present these gangs are typically competing and battling with each other for turf and making a living selling drugs and running prostitutes, some captive sex-slaves. At some point if the economy worsens and the SHTF, they could easily start looting and attacking anyone and everyone.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, in every major city in America at present, violent urban predators prey on the unarmed, old, weak, sick or disabled. And while out of control Police Swat Teams battle these predators and drug gangs, they often tyrannize the innocent which include women and young children, using excessive force all too often. There are numerous incidents of such teams murdering innocents after attacking the wrong home.</p></blockquote>
<p>The massive War on Drugs was designed as a dualistic program. One hand, the top secret part involves the USG bringing in massive amounts of illegal drugs to raise “off the books money” for covert ops. The other hand uses all serious gang crimes arising as a pretext to militarize the police as justify their deployment as Nazi Storm Troopers.</p>
<p>This second part of the War on Drugs is for public disclosure and consumption. In response to all this massive urban breakdown, the worsening economy and increasing government tyranny from the Department of Homeland Security, the TSA and out of control local police, Americans are arming at an astounding rate. Guns are literally flying off the shelves and ammo sales are at an all time high also.</p>
<p><strong>Americans now arming up in mass </strong>in order  to protect themselves from and this increasing USG Tyranny of the USG, DHS and their local militarized and Mind-kontrolled local police (1)  and from increasing and spreading urban crime which includes robberies, car-jackings, home burglaries and home invasions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also given as an important reason for arming up for the first time when asked, is a fear of possible impending economic collapse with an associated SHTF occurrence. Many express a salient and absolute need to be able to protect themselves and/or their family members from possible looters and armed home invaders which would likely accompany a SHTF urban breakdown situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>And who should be credited with creating such a foreboding urban environment? It is the Globalist Traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked the political process and Banking in America.</p>
<p><strong>These Globalist “enemies within”</strong> have rammed through economically disastrous Free-Trade Agreements and forced Diversity, Perversions and Political correctness accompanied by massive immigration, most illegal. All this has been designed to destroy the borders, language and culture of America, to neutralize its Constitution, Bill of Rights and Rule of Law while transforming America into a economically distressed Third World Nation.</p>
<p>These Globalist enemies within the Gates have been working very hard to transform America into a Democracy (Mob rule by the masses) from the Republic which was set up by our Founding Fathers.  Obviously any real enforcement of the US Constitution would assure that American would remain a republic the way it was set up.</p>
<p><strong>Since the imposition of so-called “Free Trade” policies upon the American Republic, urban decay and blight have become epidemic in major American cities.</strong> Many cities have turned into Urban Jungles, where only the strongest survive. In these Urban Jungles, violent gangs prevail and the weak are parasitized and consumed, afraid to go out of their homes, especially after dark.</p>
<p>Take Chicago, which has become a “kill or be kill” free fire Urban War Zone in some of its Urban areas. Chicago is the one of the most gun restricted areas ever, but the only ones that do not carry guns to defend themselves are law abiding citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Gang members have all the guns they want</strong>, supplied by drug gangs and the CIA and BATF.<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gang-wars-at-the-root-of-chicagos-high-murder-rate/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gang-wars-at-the-root-of-chicagos-high-murder-rate/</a></p>
<p>Some of these areas such as Washington DC have been rated as having a 300% chance of being mugged if out after dark in certain areas, which means you could likely be robbed three times in a single block if you have a victim profile (old, young, weak, disabled, female). The real unemployment rate is 37%, despite phony USG that it is 7% or less.(2)</p>
<p><strong>And now Detroit has been declared Bankrupt. </strong>It has been reported that retired police and City workers will now receive approximately 13% of their pensions due.</p>
<p>The Ruins of Detroit:</p>

<p>The ten Most Dangerous American Cities which are truly Urban Jungles at Night:</p>
<div>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aTES9UzRT-Q?feature=player_embedded" height="360" width="540" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>There are areas in Detroit, South Chicago and St. Louis that are so violent and infested with violent gangs that even the police refuse to enter unless ordered and then do so with major forces.</p>
<p>Until recently parts of Detroit was so violent that police and ambulances refused to provide service during the night hours and often found abandoned dead bodies (murder victims) days later. Detroit, known as “Iron City”, the jewel of America, used to be prosperous beyond measure based on the manufacture of the world’s finest cars.</p>
<p>Remember what a 1965 Olds Starfire coupe was like, or a mid 60′s Buick Wildcat or Pontiac Bonneville was like.  How about a mid 60′s Chevy with a HP409 engine or a Plymouth Belvedere with a 426 Hemi or 440 Wedge engine?</p>
<p><strong>That all changed in 1971 with the introduction of very extreme anti-pollution “clean air” laws</strong> which reduced automotive engine compression ratios from approximately 10.5 to 8.5, required the installation of retarded, goofy extremely inefficient camshafts.  The result was garbage engines that had little power, consumed huge increases in gasoline and a major shift in chassis quality to near complete crap. At that point American automotive quality was gone and is only starting to come back now forty years later.</p>
<p>This is but one symptom of the covert Globalist engineering of American Society on behalf of the City of London zionist Central Banksters.</p>
<blockquote><p>This of course created a great opportunity for the Japanese Auto manufacturers, secretly owned and controlled by the super-elite American Banking families. When W. Edwards Deming, an astute American engineer approached American Automotive Manufacturers in Detroit and proposed his plan to drastically reduce defects and lemons, he was rebuffed because it was felt his plan was too expensive and too slow.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Deming’s plan required 100% quality checks</strong> and verification of all parts from every supplier instead of the approximately 1% or less sampling. When Deming approached the Japanese, who had already shown a new coming expertise in motorcycles and quality circles in their electronics manufacturing, his program was accepted and implemented.</p>
<p>The rest is history, and after about 15 years, the American Automotive manufacturers have been playing a catch up game ever since for quality with the Japanese Auto manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>And now the Korean Automotive Manufacturers have hired retired Japanese automotive engineers as consultants</strong> and have adopted many of their same practices and principals to their automotive manufacturing.  The result?</p>
<p>Some Autos manufactured in South Korea have attained the same quality as the Japanese which are considered to currently be the highest quality in the world. As many automotive enthusiasts suggest, if you want the best performance buy German, if you want the highest quality buy Japanese.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a fair assumption that Globalism and the Free-Trade Agreements it produced, have resulted in the exportation of most American heavy industry, manufacturing and millions of good paying jobs. This alone has seriously harmed the American economy and set America on a path of destruction, starting first with its Urban Centers which have become urban wastelands and jungles, and now progressively spreading to middle class and upper middle class outlying suburbs.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Fair Trade with suitably adjusted reasonable Tariffs </strong>to protect American Jobs are necessary to America’s economic survival and prosperity. Free Trade is not Free at all and is an abomination to the American republic and its Sovereignty.</p>
<p>It is a tool of the Globalists to enhance the earnings of their international offshore Globalist corporations at the expense of the American worker.  It is nothing less than a secret war against America’s Sovereignty and the Republic itself.</p>
<p>The only other globalist tactic to destroy America that approaches its effectiveness are the policies of unrestricted illegal immigration, forced diversity, cultural programming that perversion is good, required perversion programming in the public schools that it is normal, and political correctness.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously these are all Globalist weapons of covert war waged against America</strong> to destroy its borders, language and culture and gut it economically.  These Globalist weapons have been deployed against Americans in order to transform America into a Third World “Democracy” instead of the Republic that it was set up to be by the Founding Fathers.</p>
<p><strong>These Traitors and Infil-Traitors in Congress and the Administration</strong> keep financing and running foreign wars for Israel in order to establish Democracy like they keep claiming we have in America. We have never had a democracy but they have been doing their best to kill the Republic on the behalf of their zionist owners and masters This is of course one of the biggest lies ever told.</p>
<blockquote><p>America has always been a Republic, a democracy is mob rule. Of course bringing in 30-60 million illegal immigrants and millions of legally sanctioned foreign workers has quickly undermined American culture and tradition and established a real base to elect politicians who appeal to the masses. The election of President Obama was the first of such travesties.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Up until recently when American aircraft manufacturers starting buying foreign parts, American aircraft were the best in the world</strong>, especially the military aircraft and fighter/interceptors. Now we have an F-22 with a contaminated O2 system from China that causes some pilots to start passing out and a Boeing Dreamliner with a faulty battery system that was imported.</p>
<p>For years St. Louis has been so poor that some of their police radio don’t work properly and their squad cars are in disrepair. In East Los Angeles, despite how tough and well armed the LA Police Department is, top police officials know that they are completely outgunned by Mexican drug gangs allowed to enter and do business inside America and also provided arms shipped by the CIA and the BATF.</p>
<p><strong>It’s not as if Americans weren’t duly warned</strong> what such Free-Trade Treaties would produce, because Presidential Candidate Ross Perot went public with what was coming.  He described the effects as a “giant sucking sound” for American jobs as they would leave America in droves.</p>
<div>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Rkgx1C_S6ls?feature=player_embedded" height="360" width="540" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p><strong>But despite Perot’s grave warnings, President George HW Bush signed NAFTA</strong> on Dec. 17, 1992 with full Congressional support. The NAFTA Treaty was ratified after Bill Clinton became President. Soon after the sucking sound started, with shocking support the the US Department of State which provided massive grants to major corporations to move manufacturing to Mexico.  These grants continued at American taxpayer expense under the subsequent Trade Treaties that were subsequently signed and ratified such as CAFTA, GATT, and WTO.</p>
<blockquote><p>Unbeknownst to most Americans, President Obama is now deeply involved in secret negotiations to pass the Trans Pacific Partnership Treaty (TPP) which experts have described as “NAFTA on Steroids”. TPP is far more than just another Free Trade Treaty which continues to lower the value of American wages to the “rock bottom” levels in third world  countries. If signed and ratified by Congress, the TPP would be the complete end to any remaining American Sovereignty.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What established this frenzy for Free-Trade Agreements?</strong> It is now known that The last duly elected President of the United States of America was Ronald Reagan.  It is also known by seasoned intel officers that Ronald Reagan distrusted American Intel in general and especially his Vice President George HW Bush.</p>
<p>In fact it has now been discovered that President Reagan distrusted the CIA and American Intel so much, he set up his “Kitchen Cabinet” and brought in Lee Wanta as his Secret Agent under the Totten Doctrine (3).</p>
<p>George HW Bush was illegally elected later as President, since his father Prescott Bush had signed an Immunity Agreement that no future Bushes (Scherfs) would ever run for office after he was arrested for “aiding the enemy” and his Union Bank assets were seized by FDR during WW2.</p>
<p><strong>It is also known that George HW Bush ran his own private CIA inside the CIA</strong> which served the specific needs of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their franchisees, the American private Federal Reserve and major Wall Street Banksters.</p>
<p>Some former top American Intel believe that it was this private GHW Bush Intel organization that tried to assassinate President Reagan, by using their man, a secret service man who fired a high speed plastic disc from a compressed air powered disc-gun, the type displayed by William Colby in Congressional Hearings on the abuses of American Intel.</p>
<blockquote><p>PBS Judy Woodruff had reported this of seeing the SS man fire a gun from a second story window that night on PBS but the story was quickly squelched and she changed it after a very convincing “not to worry visit” from some very serious American Intel agents. President Reagan, despite a long slow disjointed route to the hospital, survived. This assassination attempt however signaled that the Treasonous Bush Cabal had attained a major power base inside the Military and Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sad thing is that all the political power and influence  necessary to accomplish this and to transform the American Congress into Traitors was due to the vast money provided to K Street Lobbyists and zionist espionage groups like AIPAC, ADL, B’nai B’brith, and the like by the Central Banksters and the various Judaic groups shaken down and manipulated by zionist for donations.</p>
<p>So the first beach-head of the Globalists (aka zionist City of London Central Banksters and the “Old Black Nobility” they represented) was established with a bought, owned and controlled US Congress.  Once GHW Bush was elected President, the circle of control was complete.</p>
<p><strong>One of George W. Bush’s major assignments was to take American further down the Globalist path by fighting more Mideast wars for Israel</strong>. Another was to destroy the Republic party by being the worst President ever and fully debasing the Republican, which he did. Now the Republican leaders in Congress are tricking the Republican Party into committing suicide by agreeing to back the Democratic legislation for making illegal immigrants legal and future citizens.</p>
<blockquote><p>So it is now obvious that the Republic Party is finished and Americans need to rise up and form a new Third Party. Otherwise you can be assured that just like in the last Presidential election, both candidates will be owned by the Bush Cabal.Unless the Bush Cabal has been fully exposed and displaced by then which is now  real possibility.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>It has been estimated that there are now approximately 30 million illegal immigrants inside America</strong>allowed in by a Globalist controlled USG who prevented border enforcement and liberal immigration laws which are not enforced. With the the passage of the currently proposed Democratic plan for legalizing illegal immigrants, this number could easily grow to 60 to 100 million.</p>
<blockquote><p>In most major American Cities, Police are not allowed to arrest suspected illegal immigrants for minor traffic violations or check their identification for legal status. Not so for those whose license plates are run and show up as actual American Citizens. And this is all due to orders coming down from a few top policy-Makers who operate at the nexus of the Secret Shadow Government (SSG).</p></blockquote>
<p>GHWB could now institute major efforts to undo all the excellent plans for the economic and industrial reconstruction of America that President Reagan had set in place and activated. As has been disclosed in a previous article (4), President Reagan had brought in Lee Wanta to serve as his Secret Agent because he didn’t trust the CIA which had been corrupted and hijacked by GHWB.</p>
<p><strong>It should now be exceedingly clear</strong> to those who are well informed about the degradation of the American economy and rule of law accompanied by increasing tyranny, deployment of DHS, TSA and the passage of all the unConstitutional draconian laws (like the so-called Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, and NDAA 2014).</p>
<p>All this is being engineered by foreign controlled Globalist traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked America and worked hard to export  heavy industry, manufacturing and jobs.</p>
<p>And that they are doing this to asset strip America, destroy it’s economy and the Republic itself in order to Balkanize America and prevent it from ever rising in economic strength again and operating as a Republic “of the people, by the people and for the people”.</p>
<p><strong>Their motives for all this?</strong>  To covertly re-fight the Revolutionary war that was lost and retake America on behalf of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their Kingpin overlords the Old Black Nobility (OBN).  These hidden masters of the world-wide occult network which runs the IZCS prefer to stay hidden in the background where they can pull all the strings of several top Policy-Makers in America with no personal risk to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>What can be done to turn this around? </strong>Obviously the first step is to get rid of all Free-Trade Agreements. In order to do this all the zionist espionage fronts inside America such as AIPAC, ADL, B’nai B’rith and the like must be fully exposed and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. In order to do this zionist Israeli-American dual citizens inside Congress and the USG and its Agencies must be exposed as traitors and agents of foreign espionage and routed out of power.</p>
<p>America has to stop fighting Israel’s illegal Mideast wars and withdraw all aid and support for Israel as long as it is a criminal, racist apartheid state persecuting and murdering Palestinians and stealing their land incrementally.</p>
<p>Lee Wanta, a great American Heroe that served as President Reagan’s Secret Agent under the Totten Doctrine and was instrumental in bringing down the evil Soviet Union</p>
<p><strong>We need to re-institute the Wanta Reconstructing America Plan</strong> based on the Maglev High Speed Rail System which has the necessary funding already available. (5)</p>
<p>And it is time to also re-establish the Want Economic Recovery Plan for America that was also set up under President Reagan, but later stopped cold by George HW Bush and his Cabal when they instituted a secret coup to take over the whole USG on behalf of the City of London zionist Central Banksters and their Wall Street and Federal Reserve Franchisees.(6)</p>
<p>In fact it is a reasonable assumption that the massive Free-Trade attack on America’s economy was largely a reaction by the Bush Cabal to these amazing economic reconstruction plans President Reagan had put in place through his Secret Agent Lee Wanta, who was the master strategist that took down the Soviet Union for President Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>Recent respected surveys show that a majority of American are disgusted with the current administration</strong> and rating of the lowest ever experienced in America in the last century. Congress is also rated at an all time low with only 9% approving of it. Many view the current President as an alien imposter with no traceable past.  Some alternative media writers have stated that he is a sheep-dipped CIA creation just like Bill Clinton. All this is a mute point.  Why?</p>
<blockquote><p>Because Ronald Reagan was the last duly elected President of the United States of America, the Republic, all presidents since have been fraudulently elected and owned by the Bush Cabal. And this Bush Cabal is the Action Agent of the City of London zionist Central Banksters and their International Zionist Crime Syndicate (IZCS).</p></blockquote>
<p>The IZCS is centered in Israel where most intel is done by privatized Israeli corporations serving as American Defense and Intel contractors.  It is these private Israeli contactors who control all NSA raw intel and almost all American communications including internal White House phone calls and messaging, as well as all Pentagon and DOD communications.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously the Bush Cabal has been able to install its own Presidential puppets</strong> and run a lucrative illegal drug trafficking operations into America.  All done to destabilize and “dirty up” American Cities while absorbing a great deal of the Welfare dollars and capturing vast “off the books” funds for their own covert operations and bribery of Congress. It is a fair conclusion that the Bush Cabal has destroyed the American Rule of Law, debased any true enforcement of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights and has corrupted every institution and agency of the USG.</p>
<p><strong>However there is good news</strong>.  A growing force for good has emerged in the Alternative Media now transmitted everywhere instantly on demand by the worldwide Internet, the new Gutenberg Press and the NWO Globalist’s Achilles Heel. Yes, the Controlled Mass media (CMMM) has been a propaganda mouthpiece for the Bush Cabal and the IZCS, but is now losing its appeal and credibility. The CMMM keeps feeding lies and crap to the American public that are obviously false, like the Mideast American wars are wars to establish Democracy.  More and more Americans now realize this is complete BS, that we are there to fight Israel’s wars and defend British Oil interests.</p>
<blockquote><p>Compare the articles of Veterans Today and other respected truth media now which are being published and read by millions inside America and all over the world with the CMMM. You will see the gap between the alternative media truth and the CMMM lies is ever widening and we are starting to see Alternative Media’s popularity driving stories into the CMMM, even thought the CMMM usually attempts to neutralize their significance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many thousands of brave American Soldiers who were lied to and deceived into fighting these illegal, unConstitutional, unprovoked, undeclared wars for Israel and Big Oil, thinking that they were defending America and its freedom. Few greater lies and deceptions has ever been predicated on Americans than this complete lie.  Many thousands of Americans have been killed and horribly wounded and disabled in this war.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the American Military ever fully realizes that all these wars were phony and based on a lie and that Israel did the 9/11 attacks with the help of a cabal within the USAF and JCS, there will be hell to pay for all those perps involved. And now there is good reason to believe that day is coming in the not too distant future.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>As most Americans are beginning to realize, America has been infil-Traited by Traitors and Infil-Traitors in the highest positions of the USG</strong>.  The major economic deterioration and loss of assets to the Wall Street Banksters and the private Federal reserve through financial Fraud have been staggering and Americans are catching on the the BLATANTLY OBVIOUS.</p>
<p><strong>When American society reaches a critical mass awakening</strong> to this obvious situation that Globalists have been doing everything they can to destroy America, there will be major Blow-back of astounding proportions. When 12% of Americans are awakened, a critical mass and major turning point will be reached and you will begin to see major social change like never conceived, and this will all be due to major Blow-back from awakening.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The elites hate to acknowledge it, but when large numbers of ordinary people are moved to action, it changes the narrow political world where the elites call the shots. Inside accounts reveal the extent to which Johnson and Nixon’s conduct of the Vietnam War was constrained by the huge anti-war movement. It was the civil rights movement, not compelling arguments, that convinced members of Congress to end legal racial discrimination. More recently, the townhall meetings, dominated by people opposed to health care reform, have been a serious roadblock for those pushing reform…. A big turnout … can make a real difference….When someone tells you to stop imagining that you are having an impact, ask them to please direct their energy into getting 10 friends to join you in doing what needs to be done. If it has no impact, you’ll have gone down trying. If it has an impact, nobody will tell you for many years. (7)</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This coming complete awakening will be due to information dispensed and diffused by the Alternative Media</strong> and the worldwide Internet as well as word of mouth. it is best viewed as a byproduct of a new and powerful emerging worldwide populism which has now reached the point it is unstoppable. One recent study has established 10% as a critical mass, turning point for Society.(8)</p>
<p>I believe we are already at 11% and when we reach 12%, the days of the Bush cabal will be dated. They know it too and are scared sh*tless. That is why they have been going for broke trying to ram the NWO down our throats and militarize local police and build up DHS to oppress and then mass murder us.</p>
<p><strong>It’s time to speak up to all your family, friends and associates</strong> that we need to abandon the Republican and Democratic political Parties.  Both parties are owned and controlled by the same Overlord, the IZCS who bought them and can blackmail them with NSA provided intel.</p>
<p>Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who is also a Vet and a Navy Seal/UDT man had it right in his book of the Replican and Democrat Political Gangs in America, DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODlicans (9).</p>
<p>Gov. Ventura recommends Americans dump both political Parties which serve the same corrupt masters and start electing alternative candidates only who are not associated with either of the two parties.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It should now be exceedingly clear to those who are well informed about the degradation of the American economy and rule of law</strong> accompanied by increasing tyranny, deployment of DHS, TSA and the passage of all the unConstitutional draconian laws (like the so-called Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, and NDAA 2014), that all this is being engineered by foreign controlled Globalist traitors and infil-Traitors who have hijacked America and worked hard to export  heavy industry, manufacturing and jobs.</p>
<p>And that they are doing this to asset strip America, destroy it’s economy and the Republic itself in order to Balkanize America and prevent it from ever rising in economic strength again and operating as a Republic “of the people, by the people and for the people”.</p>
<p><strong>Their motives for all this?</strong>  To covertly re-fight the Revolutionary war that was lost and retake America on behalf of the zionist City of London Central Banksters and their Kingpin overlords the Old Black Nobility (OBN).  These hidden masters of the world-wide occult network which runs the IZCS prefer to stay hidden in the background where they can pull all the strings of several top Policy-Makers in America with no personal risk to themselves.</p>

<p>It is obviously clear. President Obama is a threat not only to the American people. He is destabilizing the United States every way he can. He did this paying for Treyvon protest trying to start race wars as one example. He is a threat to world peace. He has to be neutralized before he takes the world into an age of war and destruction. Now how can that be done? Congress can pass all the impeachment bills. The US Senate will not by two thirds vote him guilty removing him from office. Politically there is very little that can be done to interpose between Obama and him destroying the world.</p>
<p>So who will step in and take action to avert a disaster from  happening?  The usurper in the White House is the most lawless President in history that makes Nixon and Clintonlook like choir boys in comparison. President Obama does not respect the Constitution and international law. He is waging war against the American people economically and shredding our Bill of Rights daily.</p>
<p>He is waging war against Christianity on the domestic front attacking religious freedom by forcing people of conscience to pay for Obamacare the pays for abortions. He is attacking Christians in the military daring to say the name of Jesus forcing chaplains to marry homosexuals against the moral conviction of the clergy. At the same time erecting Pagan places of worship on military installations. For this matter I call on the Patriots to relieve officers of duty and command who attack the religious freedom of the men and women in uniform. I do not care if the commander is a Buddhist and gay. He must respect and defend all faiths and conscience. If he is willing to follow an unlawful, immoral order without question that will weaken the fighting strength. Then the commanders and officers who carry these immoral orders need to be relieved of command.</p>
<p>President Obama is waging war on Christians in Syria, Egypt and now in Kenya. He is waging war against Christians world wide. He is a threat to the faith. He is arming the enemies of Christianity who are murdering unarmed woman and children. His actions are bringing instability to the world. He does not regard public opinion at all when it comes to gun control when the people are buying guns in record numbers and the citizens reluctance to go to war with Iran and Syria. Obama is a dangerous loose cannon that must be stopped.</p>
<p>First, Obama may be a natural born US Citizen because he was born in Hawaii. But he renounced his US citizenship becoming an Indonesian citizen taking on the name Barry Soetoro. His records are sealed where we do not know his immigration and naturalization records documenting repatriation or if he is a US citizen. Therefore he might be ineligible to hold office. Obama by his actions says he is an agent of a foreign power working against the United States. He is a domestic enemy of the United States.</p>
<p>He is arming Al Qaeda. The same terrorist that killed and maimed soldiers and Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama’s half brother is being funded by the CIA to fund the Muslim brotherhood. Obama’s cousin Odinga is destabilizing Kenya. Odinga was given advice from Obama when he was a US Senator on how to cause havoc and destabilize Kenya for political gain.</p>
<p>Now with this massacre in Nairobi Kenya killing Christians in a Shopping mall. Now there are calls for the TSA to be in Shopping Malls that are another gun free zone. It would not surprise me if there are shootings in the malls in the states to further a police state here. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri was calling for small scale attacks on US soil. Al Zawahri is a CIA backed operative who was behind the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Obama is the head of the Muslim Brotherhood and backs AL Qaeda therefore must be taken down and brought to justice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A3Sec3.html">Treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution written in Article 3 section 3 saying</a>:</p>
<p>Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.</p>
<p>President Obama is commiting treason daily against the Americans people waging war every way possible to weaken our republic. He is involved in insurrection and rebellion against the laws of the Union.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office#Federal_Executive_and_Legislative_Branch_Oaths">Under Article 6 section 3 of the US Constitution all branches in government are bound to the oath as outlined</a></p>
<p>The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution.</p>
<p>If we took the oath. We are all duty bound to uphold that oath against all enemies foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>Those who are commissioned Officers in the Armed forces take the oath below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.army.mil/values/officers.html">Commissioned officers taken this oath:</a></p>
<p>I, _____, having been appointed an officer in the Army of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God.”</p>
<p>(DA Form 71, 1 August 1959, for officers.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/oaths.html">Enlisted personal and Non Commissioned Officers take this oath:</a></p>
<p>I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution ofthe United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the UnitedStates and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.”</p>
<p>(Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962).</p>
<p>That oath does not say to defend unconstitutional laws and illegal orders. It does not say defend a political agenda or corrupt politicians. It does not say defend the dictator. If the laws contradict the <a href="http://ucmj.us/">USMJ</a> and the Constitution of these United States. The people in the Armed forces are duty bound not to carry out the order.</p>
<p>We are very unique because our oaths are not to a person. But to the US Constitution. The people who written the Constitution and requiring an oath of affirmation to support and defend the Constitution. Not a monarchy. They knew the British Redcoats were bound to the will of the King. Not to any morals. They had to follow the decrees of the King without question.   We do not serve a monarchy. We never swore to a dictator. We serve the cause of freedom defending and preserving our Constitution. Our oath to preserve, protect and defend out Constitution is a vital check and balance against tyranny and despotism. The UCMJ requires us to follow lawful orders and not illegal edicts that goes against the law of the land</p>
<p>President Obama through insurrection is working hard to overthrow the government ofthe United States. Obama is trying to find an excuse to declare a national emergency to place the USA under Martial law. He can announce the President is  suspending the Constitution so continuity of government declaring the President Dictator under PD-51 President Bush singed. This makes the President a Dictator under any national emergency the chief executive decides what is and what isn’t . Congress has no say to review. This is a classified document congress is not allowed to read.</p>
<p>Right now in Benjamin Fulford newsletter he says with much skepticism from a source inside the Pentagon. <a href="http://www.transalchemy.com/research/white-dragon-society/">General Staff officers are making a list of 30,000 people who are New World Order thugs including the President. All to be arrested for treason and insurrection attempting to overthrow the Constitutional government. </a></p>
<p>It has been rumored the <a href="http://patriotaction.net/profiles/blogs/confirmed-attempted-arrest-of-president-obama-linked-to-navy-ship">Provost Marshal was going to arrest Obama for attempting to detonate a nuclear device in Washington DC on the 12th Anniversary of Sept 11th</a>. The shooting in the Navy yard could be a smoke screen of the attempted arrest of Obama for treason. I can tell the Military is getting ready to act to defend this nation. When Secretary of State John Kerry signed the UN Small Arms Trade Treaty. That was an act of treason trying to repeal the Second Amendment by underhanded means using treaty law.</p>
<p>I do not see much of the Military going out to confiscate guns. It is not 2005 in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. It is a different world.</p>
<p>The Military is very awake now to the President’s treasonous ways. It is my hope the Military stands down instead  of carrying out illegal orders where Obama is crowned King Nothing.</p>

<p>That it has been one of the most lackluster shopping seasons in recent years has already been repeatedly covered, with average holiday spending expected to decline for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, all this despite record promotions and an ever earlier start to Black Friday.</p>

<p>Another chart showing the same trend from Bloomberg, with the comment that the &#8220;eroding middle class can no longer drive activity as it has in the past&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s odd: we said the same thing in late 2009 for which we got yet another label of tinfoil conspiracy theorists&#8230;</p>

<p>However, while the early start to shopping season has missed expectations, driven primarily by an unprecedented weakness in traditional bricks and mortar outlets, there was some hope that the last stretch into Christmas and the New Year would provide a much needed, last minute bump. Those hopes were dashed last night when Shopptertrack reported that <strong>retail traffic plummeted by an unprecedented 21% last week, and in-store sales decreased 3.1% from the year before</strong>, dashing retailers&#8217; hopes that the final stretch before Christmas would offset soft sales numbers earlier in the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/dec/23/retail-traffic-sales-down-dec-16-22-shoppertrak/"><strong>UT San Diego reports:</strong></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The disappointing numbers, released by ShopperTrak on Monday, <strong>are &#8220;kind of staggering,&#8221; said the research firm&#8217;s founder, Bill Martin</strong>, who last week voiced optimism that retailers would see a noticeable spike in traffic and sales the week of Dec. 16-22 after two consecutive weeks of decreases in both.</p>
<p>He attributed the latest nosedive to successful November promotions, and bad weather last week in the Midwest and other central states. An increase in virtual window-shopping has prevented consumers throughout the shopping season from setting foot in many stores to look, feel and compare prices, he added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, November promotions were successful? For whom: retailers whose bottom lines got crushed in the margin collapse, or buyers who decided to wait and keep waiting for even better deals, until in the end they decided not to buy at all. Blaming the weather we understand, as do the trend to convert purchases to &#8220;window shopping&#8221; &#8211; in a world in which everything is turning virtual, it only makes sense that Americans pretend to shop asl well.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, however, is that the deus ex of online sales is not appearing and will not save the day:</p>
<blockquote><p>But even online sales aren&#8217;t growing at the expected pace. Online spending from home and work desktop computers in the U.S. from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15 was up 9 percent from the same period last year to $37.8 billion, according to the most available data from comScore.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s below the 14 percent growth that the Internet research firm is forecasting for the season.</strong></p>
<p>Even though Black Friday holds the title as single busiest shopping day of the holiday season, the week before Christmas is traditionally the busiest week in the most important shopping season of the year. Many retailers depend on November and December to make as much as 40 percent of their annual revenue, the National Retail Federation says. But while 2013 is shaping up to be the largest holiday shopping season on record, retailers are not getting the photo finish they expected.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The numbers are not devastating, but they are a bit alarming,&#8221; Martin said.</strong></p>
<p>He is not revising his forecast of 2.4 percent overall growth in retail sales for November and December, already the slowest growth since 2009, because it was strong sales in early November that caused the softer late-season sales.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, it appears that the strategy of pulling forward demand to the present through record discounts, and crushing margins in hopes of &#8220;making it up in volume&#8221; only works for those perpeptual non-cash flow generating juggernauts like Amazon, which on a long enough timeline will do everything (badly), and supposedly put everyone out of business. Just not yet.</p>
<blockquote><p>Retailers began earlier than ever promoting deep discounts and deals to appeal to frugal consumers. Retail sales in November were up 4.7 percent from 2012, the Commerce Department reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;November was pretty strong, and that&#8217;s going to carry some weight into December,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;If December ends up being flat, I expect we&#8217;re still going to have a 2.4 percent increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are some strong shopping days left before the end of the month, he said, and retailers will push hard to get shoppers back into their stores post-Christmas to exchange gifts, use gift cards and take advantage of post-holiday promotions. Gift cards are not recorded as sales until they are exchanged for merchandise, and because 80 percent of shoppers plan to buy them this year, bringing total gift card spending to an all-time high of $29.8 billion, they could have a big influence on sales after the Christmas holiday.</p>
<p>Final sales figures for the holiday shopping season are expected in January.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait. In the meantime, we expect seasonally adjusted government retail sales data to indicate once again, that all is well, and that it is not the ARIMA X 12 seasonal fudge-factor goalseeker that is wrong, but that it is reality which is at fault.</p>

<p align="left">Years ago when I described the George W. Bush regime as a police state, right-wing eyebrows were raised. When I described the Obama regime as an even worse police state, liberals rolled their eyes. Alas! Now I am no longer controversial. Everybody says it.</p>
<p>According to the UK newspaper, The Guardian, the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, had an angry exchange with Obama in which Merkel compared Obama’s National Security Agency (NSA) with the East German Communist Stasi, which spied on everyone through networks of informers.<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/merkel-compares-nsa-stasi-obama" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/17/merkel-compares-nsa-stasi-obama</a></p>
<p>Merkel grew up in Communist East Germany where she was spied upon by the Stasi, and now that she has risen to the highest political office in Europe’s most powerful state, she is spied upon by “freedom and democracy” America.</p>
<p>A former top NSA official, William Binney, declared that “We (the US) are now in a police state.” The mass spying conducted by the Obama regime, Binney says “is a totalitarian process.”<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/12/former-top-nsa-official-now-police-state.html" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/12/former-top-nsa-official-now-police-state.html<br />
</a><br />
Perhaps my best vindication, after all the hate mail from “super patriots,” who wear their ignorance on their sleeves, and Obama-worshipping liberals, whose gullibility is sickening, came from federal judge Richard Leon, who declared the Obama-sanctioned NSA spying to be “almost Orwellian.” As the American Civil Liberties Union realized, federal judge Leon’s decision vindicated Edward Snowden by ruling that the NSA spying is likely outside what the Constitution permits, “labeling it ‘Orwellian’&#8211;adding that James Madison would be ‘aghast.’”</p>
<p>If only more Americans were aghast. I sometimes wonder whether Americans like being spied upon, because it makes them feel important. “Look at me! I’m so important that the government spends enough money to wipe out US poverty spying on me and my Facebook, et. al., friends. I bet they are spending one billion dollars just to know who I connected with today. I hope it didn’t get lost in all the spam.”</p>
<p>Being spied upon is the latest craze of people devoid of any future but desperate for attention.</p>
<p>Jason Ditz at the FBI spied-upon Antiwar.com says that Judge Leon’s ruling is a setback for Obama, who was going to restore justice and liberty but instead created the American Stasi Spy State. Congress, of course, loves the spy state, because all the capitalist firms that make mega-millions or mega-billions from it generously finance congressional and senatorial campaigns for those who support the Stasi state.</p>
<p>The romance that libertarians and “free market economists” have with capitalism, which buys compliance with its greed and cooperates with the Stasi state, is foolish.</p>
<p>Let’s move on. It was only a few weeks ago that Obama and his Secretary of State John Kerry were on the verge of attacking Syria on the basis of faked evidence that Syria had crossed the “red line” and used weapons of mass destruction against the American organized, armed, and financed “rebels,” almost all of whom come from outside Syria.</p>
<p>Only the bought-and-paid-for-by-Washington French president made a show of believing a word or Washington’s lies against the Assad government in Syria. The British Parliament, long a puppet of Washington, gave Obama the bird and voted down participating in another American war crime. That left UK prime minister, David Cameron, hanging. Where do the British get prime ministers like Cameron and Blair?</p>
<p>Washington’s plan for Syria, having lost the cover of its British puppet, received a fatal blow from Russian President Putin, who arranged for Syria’s chemical weapons to be delivered to foreign hands for destruction, thus putting an end to the controversy.</p>
<p>In the meantime it became apparent that the “Syrian rebellion” organized by Washington has been taken over by al-Qaeda, an organization allegedly responsible for 9/11. Even Washington was able to figure out that it didn’t make sense to put al-Qaeda in charge of Syria. Now the headlines are: “West tells Syria rebels: Assad must stay.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington’s arrogance has managed to make an enemy of India. The TSA, a component of Homeland Security, subjected a female diplomat from India to multiple strip searches, cavity searches and ignored her protestations of consular immunity.<a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/18/devyani-khobragade-reveals-how-she-broke-down-after-stripping-and-cavity-searches-as-row-between-u-s-and-india-deepens/" target="_blank">http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/12/18/devyani-khobragade-reveals-how-she-broke-down-after-stripping-and-cavity-searches-as-row-between-u-s-and-india-deepens/</a></p>
<p>There was no justification whatever for this abuse of an Indian diplomat. To indicate its displeasure, the Indian government has removed barriers that prevent truck bombs from being driven into the US embassy.</p>
<p>Washington has managed to recreate the arms race. More profits for the military/security complex, and less security for the world. Provoked by Washington’s military aggressiveness, Russia has announces a $700 billion upgrade of its nuclear ballistic missiles. China’s leaders have also made it clear that China is not intimidated by Washington’s intrusion into China’s sphere of influence. China is developing weapon systems that make obsolete Washington’s large investment in surface fleets.</p>
<p>Recently, Pat Buchanan, Mr. Conservative himself, made a case that Russia’s Putin better represents traditional American values than does the President of the United States.<a href="http://www.unz.com/pbuchanan/is-putin-one-of-us/" target="_blank">http://www.unz.com/pbuchanan/is-putin-one-of-us/</a></p>
<p>Buchanan has a point. It is Washington, not Moscow or Beijing, that threatens to bomb countries into the stone age, that forces down airplanes of heads of state and subjects them to searches, and that refuses to honor grants of political asylum.</p>
<p>Certainly, Washington’s claim to be “exceptional” and “indispensable” and, therefore, above law and morality contrasts unfavorably with Putin’s statement that “we do not infringe on anyone’s interests or try to teach anyone how to live.”</p>
<p>Washington’s arrogance has brought America disrepute. What damage will Washington next inflict on us?</p>

				<p>November 15, 2013 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19191#respond" title="Comment on What Is The Real Agenda Of The American Police State?"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="19191 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=19191">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>In my last column I emphasized that it was important for American citizens to demand to know what the real agendas are behind the wars of choice by the Bush and Obama regimes. These are major long term wars each lasting two to three times as long as World War II.</p>
<p>Forbes reports that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaruiz/2013/11/04/report-a-million-veterans-injured-in-iraq-afghanistan-wars/">one million US soldiers</a> have been injured in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.</p>
<p>RT reports that the cost of keeping each US soldier in Afghanistan has risen from <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-afghanistan-pentagon-troops-budget-721/">$1.3 million per soldier to $2.1 million per soldier</a>.</p>
<p>Matthew J. Nasuti reports in the Kabul Press that it cost US taxpayers $50 million to kill one Taliban soldier. That means it cost <a href="http://kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?article32304">$1 billion to kill 20 Taliban fighters</a>.  This is a war that can be won only at the cost of the total bankruptcy of the United States.</p>
<p>Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes have estimated that the current out-of-pocket and already incurred future costs of the Afghan and Iraq wars is at least $6 trillion.</p>
<p>In other words, it is the cost of these two wars that explain the explosion of the US public debt and the economic and political problems associated with this large debt.</p>
<p>What has America gained in return for $6 trillion and one million injured soldiers, many very severely?</p>
<p>In Iraq there is now an Islamist Shia regime allied with Iran in place of a secular Sunni regime that was an enemy of Iran, one as dictatorial as the other, presiding over war ruins, ongoing violence as high as during the attempted US occupation, and extraordinary birth defects from the toxic substances associated with the US invasion and occupation.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan there is an undefeated and apparently undefeatable Taliban and a revived drug trade that is flooding the Western world with drugs.</p>
<p>The icing on these Bush and Obama “successes” are demands from around the world that Americans and former British PM Tony Blair be held accountable for their war crimes. Certainly, Washington’s reputation has plummeted as a result of these two wars. No governments anywhere are any longer sufficiently gullible as to believe anything that Washington says.</p>
<p>These are huge costs for wars for which we have no explanation.</p>
<p>The Bush/Obama regimes have come up with various cover stories: a “war on terror,”<br />
“we have to kill them over there before they come over here,” “weapons of mass destruction,” revenge for 9/11, Osama bin Laden (who died of his illnesses in December 2001 as was widely reported at the time).</p>
<p>None of these explanations are viable. Neither the Taliban nor Saddam Hussein were engaged in terrorism in the US. As the weapons inspectors informed the Bush regime, there were no WMD in Iraq. Invading Muslim countries and slaughtering civilians is more likely to create terrorists than to suppress them. According to the official story, the 9/11 hijackers and Osama bin Laden were Saudi Arabians, not Afghans or Iraqis. Yet it wasn’t Saudi Arabia that was invaded.</p>
<p>Democracy and accountable government simply does not exist when the executive branch can take a country to wars in behalf of secret agendas operating behind cover stories that are transparent lies.</p>
<p>It is just as important to ask these same questions about the agenda of the US police state. Why have Bush and Obama removed the protection of law as a shield of the people and turned law into a weapon in the hands of the executive branch? How are Americans made safer by the overthrow of their civil liberties? Indefinite detention and execution without due process of law are the hallmarks of the tyrannical state. They are terrorism, not a protection against terrorism. Why is every communication of every American and apparently the communications of most other people in the world, including Washington’s most trusted European allies, subject to being intercepted and stored in a gigantic police state database? How does this protect Americans from terrorists?</p>
<p>Why is it necessary for Washington to attack the freedom of the press and speech, to run roughshod over the legislation that protects whistleblowers such as Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden, to criminalize dissent and protests, and to<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/opinion/another-chilling-leak-investigation.html?_r=0"> threaten journalists</a> such as Julian Assange, Glenn Greenwald, and Fox News reporter James Rosen?</p>
<p>How does keeping citizens ignorant of their government’s crimes make citizens safe from terrorists?</p>
<p>These persecutions of truth-tellers have nothing whatsoever to do with “national security” and “keeping Americans safe from terrorists.” The only purpose of these persecutions is to protect the executive branch from having its crimes revealed. Some of Washington’s crimes are so horrendous that the International Criminal Court would issue a death sentence if those guilty could be brought to trial. A government that will destroy the constitutional protections of free speech and a free press in order to prevent its criminal actions from being disclosed is a tyrannical government.</p>
<p>One hesitates to ask these questions and to make even the most obvious remarks out of fear not only of being put on a watch list and framed on some charge or the other, but also out of fear that such questions might provoke a false flag attack that could be used to justify the police state that has been put in place.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was what the Boston Marathon Bombing was. Evidence of the two brothers’ guilt has taken backseat to the government’s claims. There is nothing new about government frame-ups of patsies. What is new and unprecedented is the lockdown of Boston and its suburbs, the appearance of 10,000 heavily armed troops and tanks to patrol the streets and search without warrants the homes of citizens, all in the name of protecting the public from one wounded 19 year old kid.</p>
<p>Not only has nothing like this ever before happened in the US, but also it could not have been organized on the spur of the moment. It had to have been already in place waiting for the event. This was a trial run for what is to come.</p>
<p>Unaware Americans, especially gullible “law and order conservatives,” have no idea about the militarization of even their local police. I have watched local police forces train at gun clubs. The police are taught to shoot first not once but many times, to protect their lives first at all costs, and not to risk their lives by asking questions. This is why the 13-year old kid with the toy rifle was shot to pieces. Questioning would have revealed that it was a toy gun, but questioning the “suspect” might have endangered the precious police who are trained to take no risks whatsoever.</p>
<p>The police operate according to Obama’s presidential kill power: murder first then create a case against the victim.</p>
<p>In other words, dear American citizen, you life is worth nothing, but the police whom you pay, are not only unaccountable but also their lives are invaluable. If you get killed in their line of duty, it is no big deal. But don’t you injure a police goon thug in an act of self-defense. I mean, who do you think you are, some kind of mythical free American with rights?</p>
