<p>We are almost 3 months away from the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. If we are lucky, Wall Street’s puppet government in Washington will not blow up the world by June 28, 2014.</p>
<p>I have always despised President Woodrow Wilson for getting America into World War I. I want to cure the world of reoccurring Depressions through Worldwide Debt Cancellation and Monetary Reform. As I have explained before, Depressions in the West are caused by the accumulation of Unpayable Debts. These occur because Bankers have the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing. We need a non-interest bearing currency like President Lincoln’s Greenbacks. And we also must end fractional reserve banking which allows a bank to lend out ten dollars for every one on deposit. Woodrow Wilson gave us the Federal Reserve bank and WW I. We have had cycles of wars and Depressions ever since.</p>
<p>I would like to compare 1914 to what is happening today. Let me begin by quoting something I wrote about World War I a few years ago.</p>
<p>Edith Cavell made a fatal mistake. She mistakenly believed she lived in a democracy. She was a British nurse working in Belgium in 1915. She saw first hand the horrors of trench warfare. She also saw a quick and easy means for England to end the war with a victory. She wrote a letter to the Nursing Mirror which was published on April 15th, 1915. She said that ‘Belgian Relief’ efforts were actually being sent to Germany which would have to sue for peace without this aid from the allies. England was quite literally feeding the German army that was killing millions of French and British soldiers. What she did not know was that similar allied war materiel was being sent to Germany via Sweden and other neutral nations so the war could continue for several more years.</p>
<p>Sir William Wiseman heard about her letter. He was the head of British Intelligence in North America for MI6. He was a partner at the Rothschild owned Kuhn and Loeb Investment Bank. He ordered the Germans to arrest Edith Cavell. She was subsequently shot as a spy. Her mistake was to think that she lived in a democracy where the people could vote, write letters to the editor and have a say in the life and death decisions of the nation. She did not live to see what we have seen.</p>
<p>Americans ought not to believe they live in a democracy. Our politicians cannot prove to us that our votes are honestly counted. Every President since 1989 has been a CIA asset. The CIA is allowed to fly heroin and cocaine into America by the plane load. And the CIA is allowed to go into Senate Intelligence Committee computers and erase documents proving the Agency guilty of torture.</p>
<p>The media seems all too willing to cover up every plot against the American people from the assassination of President Kennedy to the controlled demolitions of the Murrah Federal building on April 19, 1995 and World Trade Center Towers 1, 2 and 7 on September 11, 2001. They also were willing to let the previous administration tell us lies to justify the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. And now the current administration tells us lies about Crimea. Believing their propaganda could get us all killed.</p>
<p>The US paid the opposition $5 billion to start riots before the May elections could be held. Then they hired snipers from as far away as Israel to shoot both the protesters and the police. They installed a Jewish banker as President without elections because they were not sure the people would vote to join the European Union in May. The coup leaders passed laws making the minority Hungarian and Russian languages sort of illegal. And just as they did in Libya the Americans stole the Ukraine’s gold and looted their banks. This plan to seize the Ukraine was mentioned in print by Zbigniew Brzezinski in 2007. He assumed Russia would respond by taking back the Crimea which Khrushchev had given away in 1954.</p>
<p>Barack Obama and his advisers are probably even more incompetent than Woodrow Wilson and his crew. The Obama crowd has announced war game exercises for Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltics. Hopefully, Putin understands America cannot do anything militarily against a real Army. Obama’s advisers would like to crush Russia with sanctions. That will never happen. Russia has gold, oil, natural gas and other products that people all over the world want to buy. Nobody wants to buy America’s Genetically Modified Organisms. Even with retail stores dying America is still importing far more than it exports. And the Government Accounting Office said that the alleged 680 billion 2013 US budget deficit was really a trillion dollars. America by design has a permanently sick economy. America cannot survive sanctions.</p>
<p>Russia intends to announce the Holy Grail of energy deals in May when Putin visits China. China will buy Russian oil and natural gas with yuan. The United States has been occupying Afghanistan, funding Al Qaeda against Syria and killing people in Pakistan and Yemen with drones to prevent pipelines from distributing natural gas to Europe and to China. This restraint of trade has forced the price of natural gas and oil higher. Americans pay what they think are high rates for electricity but their natural gas prices are low. I am not familiar with the details of English utility bills but their utility bills are a lot higher than ours. And their government allows really outrageous gouging. European Union energy rules do not seem to be helping either. Barack’s forcing Russia to sell oil and natural gas to China will severely harm our allies in Great Britain and Europe. The economy of the EU cannot survive a 40% rise in their utility bills. They are near collapse anyway you say. Yes. But sanctions if not stopped now will push them over the edge sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>NATO wants to bring the Ukraine into their military alliance. This means if the Ukrainian coup leaders want to start World War III, we are all obligated to die. I once heard a Scotsman say that NATO stands for Not Altogether Thought Out. The Russians as part of that May Summit with China will be selling them Sukhoi SU-35 jet fighters. They can out maneuver the American F-22 and F-35 both of which are not really operational.</p>
<p>Prior to Putin’s visit to China in May the Chinese are expected to announce their gold holdings late in April. The last time they announced those holdings was in April of 2009. Sun Tzu in The Art of War said ‘when you are many pretend to be few.’ As I have said before, China has at least 7,000 tons of gold. They might announce a much lower number or delay the press release if they are not yet ready to reveal a gold backed yuan. They might prefer to do that in May or at least to announce something like the End of the Petrodollar which would be Phase I of the destruction of the US economy. That could take the form of an announcement that oil and natural gas would henceforth be bought and sold only in yuan, rubles and gold. That would send the dollar into a tailspin from which it will never recover.</p>
<p>All of this will come to a head at least a month before the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand on June 28, 2014. This time around I am hopeful that the US military which several times has had to say No to launching World War III by attacking Iran will refuse to get us and themselves killed. Why should we die because Wall Street cannot manage the economy without stealing our money by the tens of trillions, starving people to death by the hundreds of millions and killing people in their wars by the billions?</p>

<p>Their <i>al Qaeda</i> terrorists soundly defeated by Hezbollah forces in Syria, the City of London Illuminati banksters have turned their sights on resource-rich Ukraine. They knew Russian President Vladimir Putin would be distracted by the Sochi Olympics, along with the barrage of threats and propaganda being hurled his way by these demonic Zio-fascists and their Western media lapdogs.</p>
<p>With unlimited time and money at their disposal, this is the bankster <i>modus operandi</i>. They attack where they see opportunity, retreat when defeated, then attack another sector of the planet within days based on vulnerability and resources.</p>
<p>Ukraine declared independence from the old Soviet Union in 1990. In 2004-2005 Western NGOs worked with CIA/Mossad/MI6 assets to stage the phony Orange Revolution. Victor Yuschenko became Prime Minister but was poisoned during the campaign. Western media blamed it on the Russians, but it was likely a Mossad operation since he was succeeded by more bankster-friendly right-wing billionaire Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko had co-led the Orange Revolution and is one of Ukraine’s richest people. In 2005 <i>Forbes</i> named her the third most powerful woman in the world. In 2007 she traveled to the US to meet with Vice-President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor Condaleeza Rice to talk energy. Tymoshenko became rich as an executive at a natural gas company.</p>
<p>Ukraine was being plugged into Cheney’s crooked Energy Policy Task Force, which opened the planet to unregulated oil &amp; gas exploration, including fracking. Tymoshenko privatized over 300 state industries during her reign,</p>
<p>But the Ukrainian people smelled a rat.</p>
<p>In 2010 they voted in Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych with 48% of the vote. His Party of Regions again defeated Tymoshenko’s Fatherland Party in parliamentary elections of 2012.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko was convicted of embezzlement of state funds and abuse of power. She was given a seven year prison sentence and fined $188 million. The crimes occurred in the natural gas sector.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Tymoshenko was released from prison as part of a deal hatched at a secret meeting between Yanukovych, EU, NATO and Russian officials first reported by William Engdahl in an article for <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/02/27/the-rape-of-ukraine-phase-two-begins/">Veterans Today</a>. Soon after her release all hell broke loose.</p>
<p><b>Mossad’s Fascist Friends</b></p>
<p>On February 22nd snipers opened fire from rooftops on Kiev’s square. Engdahl says these snipers were members of a far-right fascist terror cell known as Ukrainian National Assembly – Ukrainian People’s Self Defense (UNA-UNSO).</p>
<p>Led by Andriy Shkil, the group has ties to the neo-Nazi German National Democratic Party. According the Engdahl’s intelligence sources UNA-UNSO is part of a secret NATO Gladio cell and was involved in conflicts ranging from Georgia to Kosovo to Chechnya as part of a strategy of tension aimed at Russia.</p>
<p>Shkil also has direct ties to Tymoshenko, as does newly installed Prime Minster Oleksandr Turchynov, a Baptist preacher and former Tymoshenko advisor who took over after Yanukovych fled under threat to his life to Russia.</p>
<p>In 2006 state prosecutors opened a criminal case against Turchynov, who was accused of destroying files which showed Tymoshenko’s ties to organized crime boss Semion Mogilevich. With Turchynov as Prime Minister Ukraine is now under the thumb of fascist organized criminals known collectively as Right Sector.</p>
<p>It came as no surprise then, when <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/03/01/352724/israeli-army-vet-led-kiev-militia-unit/">Press TV</a> reported that both <i>Haaretz</i> and the <i>Times of Israel</i> openly bragged of how a group of “former” Israeli soldiers known as the Blue Helmets of the Maidan had led the “protesters” in Kiev’s square under the leadership of a man code-named Delta. According to <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/02/17/us-eu-paying-ukrainian-rioters-protesters-paul-craig-roberts/">Paul Craig Roberts</a>, these “protestors” were also being paid by the EU and US.</p>
<p>A Mossad coup brought Right Sector to power, pushing aside more moderate voices being funded and backed by the US, as revealed in the now-infamous YouTube video showing Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland discussing with US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt (both Israeli assets within the State Department) who they would want to install as Ukrainian Prime Minster once they got rid of Yanukovych.</p>
<p><b>A Resource Grab</b></p>
<p>As usual this Rothschild-led bankster <i>putsch</i> is all about resources. Ukraine lies in a highly strategic geographic location, fronting both the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Ukraine is the bread basket of the Eastern Hemisphere. In 2011 it was the world’s 3rd largest grain exporter. It ranks in the top 10 countries in the world for sought-after farmland.</p>
<p>Ukraine has the 2nd largest military in Europe after Russia and the NATO Rothschild tool would love nothing better than to run out the<a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/analysts-black-sea-port-in-ukraine-still-key-to-russia-s-naval-interests-1.270904">Russian Black Sea Fleet</a> at Sevastopol – a symbol of Russian naval power since the 18th century.</p>
<p>Ukraine has vast natural gas deposits, an advanced industrial base and is a highly strategic crossroads for oil &amp; gas pipelines connecting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Their-Bankers-Persian-Gulf/dp/1453757732">Four Horsemen</a> Caspian Sea energy fields with European consumers. In 2009 a dispute between Putin and Tymoshenko over Russia’s trans-Ukrainian gas supplies caused a huge spike in gas prices in Europe.</p>
<p>In October 2013 the IMF met with Ukrainian officials to discuss the country’s alleged “budget crisis”. The bankster enforcer arm demanded that Ukraine double consumer prices for natural gas and electricity, devalue its currency, slash state funding for schools and the elderly, and lift a ban on the sale of its rich farmland to foreigners. In return for this Ukraine was promised a measly $4 billion.</p>
<p>Yanukovych told the IMF to take a hike and Russia soon stepped in promising <i>cheaper</i> energy and stating it would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian bonds. Yanukovych was now on the bankster hit list, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Russia has responded to the Ukrainian coup by sending troops into the Crimea to protect its mostly Russian-speaking population and the Black Sea Fleet. It was here 160 years ago where Catherine the Great launched a major campaign to seize the Crimea from Ottoman sultans.</p>
<p>During WWII ethnic Tatars in Crimea collaborated with Hitler in seizing the region briefly, before Stalin routed them and expelled the Tatar separatists. Many have since returned.</p>
<p>As this drama unfolds, look for the banksters’ Western media tool to make up some “humanitarian crisis” involving the Tatars. There will be more trouble in Crimea.</p>
<p>But the Russians have responded swiftly, as has the alternative media. It ain’t like the good old days, where bankster coups went unquestioned and unnoticed. The Ukrainian people will not stand for these fascists for long either. They saw the empty promises brought forth by the last bankster “event”- the Orange Revolution. They have experience in the field.</p>
<p>The demonic City of London <i>Illuminati</i> banksters may have unlimited time and money. But the people are awakening. The human spirit has unlimited potential. We are much closer to the beginning of this story than to the end.</p>

			<p><strong><em>The Legend of “Nostradamus, Jr.” continues&#8230;</em></strong></p>
<div><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/nostradamus-3.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>Most predictions about the future are risky attempts at guessing. If one is fortunate, they come across a clairvoyant, who has a long established record of forecasting political prospects. In the long tradition of prognostication, by the one and only, Nostradamus, Jr., William B. Kaliher presents his 2014 prophecy. The yearly feature on the <a href="http://etherzone.com/cgi-bin/search/search.pl?Terms=%22William+Kaliher%22&amp;I1.x=22&amp;I1.y=8&amp;sort-method=3">EtherZone</a> site produced a loyal following of eager future deprived junkies. Taking pleasure in continuing this esteem exercise in sarcasm, Stuck on Stupid offers commentary on a sample of these mystic omens, which can be found on <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/010114.html">&#8220;Nostradamus, Jr.&#8221; Kaliher’s Annual Top 101 Predictions for 2014</a></p>
<p><em>10. A new danger this year will be Progressive heads unexpectedly exploding. Study of the syndrome will reveal after mistakenly reading a reputable publication, damaged and unused synapses in Progressives will heal sufficiently to realize even after six years imitating a president, Obama&#8217;s resume and accomplishments still don&#8217;t measure up to superwoman Sarah Palin.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Such an admission that NeoCon Palin has more accomplishments means there is an antidote to government school brainwashing.<em></em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>14. Communist Mijail Gorbachov will be recognized as more enlightened than Abraham Lincoln for allowing bullied states to secede.</em></p>

<p>This list was selected as the tame examples. If you are daring, read the <a href="http://www.batr.org/stupid/010114.html">entire 101 items.</a> A serious analysis and critical review of politics is mostly ignored by the general public. The popular culture is made up of people who cannot learn, of fools who repeat their mistakes time and again, and persons who constantly screw up.</p>
<p>The art in satire varies with the source and even more with the audience. Mr. Kaliher’s perspective may seem twisted to an apologist for the establishment. It might seem downright hostile to the statist, who places trust in government. However, the continual absurdity, year after year, just grows.</p>
<p>Both in the irony of the illustrations and in the intensity of the deranged circumstances, what comes out of the political class of illusionists, is even more frightening. Truth is stranger than fiction. Yet the refusal to admit the con game that is played on citizens is the primary reason that it never ends.</p>
<p>Accepting a corrupt system as normal or inevitable is defeatist to the core. Each generation of public officials move closer to act as irrelevant puppets and lap dog administers for the dictates of perverted elites. Is there humor in this act or is it beyond the abilities of the system to provide a correcting mechanism to reverse the unwavering descent into the ridiculous.</p>
<p>So what are the reasonable expectations for 2014? Will the Republicans take the Senate? Will an amnesty immigration bill pass? Or will the administration find a magic medicine to cure Obamacare? The score card usually misses the final outcome of the game.</p>
<p>When drawn together, all the Nostradamus, Jr. Predictions for the last ten years, the picture seems far more enlightening than entertaining. The sorry state of affairs, when considered as a continual trend towards a loss in quality of life, is the only conclusion possible. Only a lazy meathead refuses to face the facts and adjust behavior when the seer speaks.</p>

<p>The British Parliament does not buy the lies of the Obama administration which have been invented as a pretext to take America to war with Syria and drag its allies into the conflict. The American people, by a 9 to 1 margin are not in favor of attacking Syria. As a result, Putin is laughing at the clown that now occupies the presidency.</p>
<p>If at first we don’t succeed, lie, lie, again, should become the slogan for the criminal administration that is inhabiting the White House.</p>
<h4>Caught Again!</h4>
<p>Once again, Obama has been caught with his “false flag hand” in the cookie jar. With increasing doubt over the “official story” that Assad crossed the “red line” and used chemical weapons against his own people has been called into question. The Obama administration has responded by releasing the following unclassified U.S. intelligence report disseminated on August 30th by the White House which concluded that there was “high confidence” that Assad’s forces had used chemical weapons several times in the last year, including the August 21st attack in the suburbs of Damascus.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“We have identified one hundred videos attributed to the attack, many of which show large numbers of bodies exhibiting physical signs consistent with, but not unique to, nerve agent exposure. The reported symptoms of victims included unconsciousness, foaming from the nose and mouth, constricted pupils, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty breathing. Several of the videos show what appear to be numerous fatalities with no visible injuries, which is consistent with death from chemical weapons, and inconsistent with death from small-arms, high-explosive munitions or blister agents. At least 12 locations are portrayed in the publicly available videos, and a sampling of those videos confirmed that some were shot at the general times and locations described in the footage.   physical symptoms verified by medical personnel and NGOs, and other information associated with this chemical attack.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>How does a YouTube video demonstrate “rapid heartbeat?”</strong> These murderous criminals cannot even concoct a believable cover story.</p>
<p>In a case of “it is as we say it is,” the intelligence report went on to state that the Syrian opposition, who is in actuality, the CIA backed al-Qaeda forces in the region, does not have the “capability to manufacture 100 videos” of gas attacks upon the Syrian people. Really? The Syrian people cannot find and use 100 videos and upload them to YouTube? And even if Obama was telling the truth, the CIA could certainly have created 100 YouTube videos on their own.</p>
<div><img alt="... and Muslim Brotherhood = MI6 ..." src="http://wariscrime.com/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/al-ciada.jpg" width="276" height="142" /><br />
<em>&#8230; and Muslim Brotherhood = MI6 &#8230;</em></p>
</div>
<p>If the US intelligence community had this information on August 21st, then why did it take nine days to become publicly available? If Obama’s goal was to prevent the further loss of innocent life in Syria, shouldn’t this information been immediately made publicly available? Shouldn’t a copy of the report have been made immediately available to the United Nations Security Council? If Obama wanted British support and participation in the upcoming American massacre of innocent Syrians, shouldn’t Obama have immediately made this information available to Parliament BEFORE they voted to not help Obama start WWIII?</p>
<p>If Obama was telling the truth in the August 21st report, shouldn’t every media outlet in world should have been immediately provided a copy of the evidence? Why is this evidence only now being made available AFTER the British rejection of our failed Syrian policies?</p>
<p>America, you are being asked to believe the fiction and accept the fact that we are going to commence WWIII based on series of YouTube videos. This kind of evidence would even be admissible in traffic court.</p>
<h4>Obama Thinks the World Is Dumber Than a Box of Rocks</h4>
<p>Falsely using videos to mislead the American people as well as the rest of the world are not new behaviors consistent with the past behaviors of this administration.</p>
<p>I seem to recall that a rogue video was given as the reason that this administration used in order to fabricate an excuse as to why al-Qaeda would move to kill Ambassador Stevens and his security team nearly a year ago. Let’s reflect back to the early days following Ambassador Stevens assassination as the administration was clumsily attempting to establish a case for plausible deniability for their involvement in the murder.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>September 16 — Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Candy Crowley:</strong></p>
<p><em>“There was a hateful video that was disseminated on the Internet. It had nothing to do with the United States government, and it’s one that we find disgusting and reprehensible. It’s been offensive to many, many people around the world. That sparked violence in various parts of the world, including violence directed against Western facilities including our embassies and consulates.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>On CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Rice also said that,<em> “We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned.”</em> Subsequently, Susan Rice was asking the American people to buy the fiction that Stevens was killed by a flash mob over a video that nobody watched in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same. Obama is caught, once again, dipping into his false flag playbook in order to justify more murder and more crimes against humanity.</p>
<h4>Who Cares?</h4>
<p>Even if Assad did use chemical weapons against his people, and he did not, who cares? This is an internal matter for the Syrian people to deal with. Syria has done nothing to the United States. Syria poses no threat to anyone outside of Syria.</p>
<p>Has Obama appointed himself to become the judge, jury and executioner of the world? The United States has no right to enter into Syria no matter how many false flag attacks that Obama manufactures.</p>
<h4>A Bad Omen for the American People</h4>
<p>If Obama is foolish enough to go it alone in Syria, the American people need to be forewarned about what could lie ahead in order that our people can move to protect themselves from the consequences of living under this lunatic administration.</p>
<p>When and if Obama attacks Syria, I have had multiple sources inform me that Putin is prepared to strike Saudi Arabia. This could potentially stop the flow of oil from the Middle East. The United States government would immediately move to restrict private access to fuel in this country in order to conserve the reserves inside of the United States. This would paralyze our economy as our grocery stores and major retail outlets, which operate on real time delivery principles, would be virtually empty in matter of days. Our American way of life would end on this note.</p>
<p>America is facing the distinct possibility that Obama will use multiple false flag attacks on American soil in which Syria and possibly Iran take the blame. This would provide Obama with the pretext and the moral high ground from which to prosecute his war in the Middle East that he is so determined to engage in.</p>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>The false flag option is the most likely outcome of all the scenarios I have considered. This simply means that some of you who are reading these words might have to perish in order for Obama to pursue his mandate to eradicate Syria and Iran.</p>
<p>We should consider that the use of a false flag event against the American people fits the demonstrable mentality of this administration. Secondly, Obama needs a quick and decisive excuse to attack Syria and eventually Iran because he has some damning skeletons trying to get out of the closet. Obama has multiple scandals hanging over his head which were brought out in one short time frame in the mainstream media during a 30 day period in May and June.</p>
<p>It is apparent to all that the release of this information on these multiple scandals was orchestrated because the release of information occurred in such a tight time frame. Any one of the following events could be grounds for impeachment and are far worse than anything ever done by Richard Nixon.</p>
<p>These scandals include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IRS spying on Obama’s political enemies.</li>
<li>The NSA spy scandal.</li>
<li>More damning information on the murder of Chris Stevens.</li>
<li>The AP reporters spy scandal.</li>
<li>Rumblings of resurfacing the Fast and Furious scandal in which Obama and Holder shipped guns to the Mexican cartels which have been used to kill tens of thousands including Border Patrol Agent, Brian Terry.</li>
<li>The Michael Hastings murder.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Who Is Blackmailing Obama?</h4>
<p>Who would have released this damning information on Obama and then made it virtually disappear from the mainstream media? It had to be some interest who already controls the media and this would be the banksters. These are the same banksters who desire to preserve the Petrodollar which Iran threatens to destroy by selling oil for gold. I predict that unless Obama can quickly get us into a war in the Middle East, which would save the almighty Petrodollar, he will not complete his second term and will be removed as a result of the aforementioned scandals which are being used to blackmail Obama and force his hand in the Middle East.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I have said it before and bears repeating, store the essentials elements that you will need to survive what is coming. America, we are in for some very dark days.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/argoben3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/argoben2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Secret agents are supposed to be secret but their existence is common knowledge.  We know that they exist, but most people don&#8217;t know what they get up to, what they actually do.  The main reason for this is that the conventional news media coverage of intelligence agencies focuses almost exclusively on them gathering information, portraying them as passive observers of the shadowy underworlds that surround our &#8216;civilisation&#8217;.  Their active role in covertly wielding influence on both a small and large scale is essentially ignored.</p>
<p>The vacuum left by the absence of real-life news media reporting on the actions of the secret services is filled with spy-fi, or spy fiction.  The world&#8217;s most famous spy, James Bond, has been aped across the world, the US versions even sometimes bearing the same initials &#8211; Jack Bauer from <i>24</i> and Jason Bourne from the <i>Bourne</i> films are simple examples.  Throughout the decades it has largely been British authors &#8211; Somerset Maugham in the 1930s, Ian Fleming in the 1950s, John le Carré and others since then - who set the tone and standards for spy-fi authors.  Most of these people were themselves spies for the British security services &#8211; Maugham worked for MI6 during WW1, Fleming ran a naval intelligence commando unit during WW2, le Carré was MI5 and MI6.</p>
<p>It was in Fleming&#8217;s James Bond novels in the 1950s that the CIA, at that time an agency whose existence was not officially admitted, were first named and portrayed.  As recent <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/JCWS_a_00310" target="_blank">research</a> by Dr Christopher Moran has shown, Fleming was friends with then-CIA director Allen Dulles, who was &#8216;fascinated&#8217; by the Bond novels and <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">in particular the gadgetry</a>.  Over time the two became closer friends, to the extent that Dulles even asked Fleming to use his popular books to help portray the CIA in a positive light.  Similarly, it was British filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock who largely created the spy thriller genre in cinema in the inter-war period.  It was in Hitchcock&#8217;s late-50s film <i>North by Northwest </i>that Hollywood first named and depicted the CIA.  In both print and on the screen it was left to British creative talent to break the ground of public portraits of the CIA.</p>
<p>However, unlike Fleming and others, there is no evidence that Hitchcock himself ever worked for the security services, though he was spied on for a time <a href="http://www.spyculture.com/profile-alfred-hitchcock/" target="_blank">by the FBI</a>.  This included one incident in the early 1960s where an FBI mole at Revue Studios told the Bureau that a character in an episode of <i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents </i>was an &#8216;improper portrayal of an FBI agent&#8217;.  The Feds applied pressure and the character was watered down to being a private detective who used to work for the Bureau.</p>
<p>Much the same process continues today.  The former head of MI5 Stella Rimington is writing popular spy-fi, the British security services provided &#8216;former&#8217; officers as advisors on the hugely popular TV show <i>Spooks</i> and the CIA is deeply involved in Hollywood.  In my <a href="http://www.smellslikehumanspirit.com/2013/02/operationmockingbirdcia.html" target="_blank">previous article</a> for this site I outlined how the CIA&#8217;s first official entertainment industry liaison Chase Brandon recruited actress Jennifer Garner to appear in a CIA recruitment ad.  However, that is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Chase Brandon was a technical consultant on the show <i>Alias</i>, which launched Garner to stardom.  He was also a consultant on <i>The Sum of All Fears</i> (2002) and <i>The Recruit </i>(2003), both immediate post-9/11 films that depicted the CIA in an extremely favourable light.  Just like the pre-9/11 <i>Enemy of the State </i>(1998) the images and stories in these films and TV shows are a synthesis of high-value production with the glory of the security state.  Sexy young things run about and look confused for our amusement, while advanced technology spies on everything to provide the watching audience with a near-omniscient perspective.  Two spectacles for the price of one, you might say.</p>
<p>One particular interesting nexus of connections is worthy of greater scrutiny.  <i>The Sum of All Fears </i>starred Ben Affleck in the &#8216;sexy young thing running about&#8217; role.  Not long after, Affleck and Garner met while co-starring in the film <i>Daredevil </i>(2003) and they fell in love and got married in 2005.  This is perhaps not at all surprising as they had a lot in common: they were born in the same year, were both rising stars, and had both worked on CIA-assisted productions.  Since they met Garner appeared in a CIA recruitment ad (2004) and more recently Ben Affleck directed and starred in the Academy Award-winning film <i>Argo</i> (2012) which tells the largely true story of the CIA setting up a fake film company as the cover for a black operation.  It is fair to say that they are not only one of Hollywood&#8217;s favourite couples, they are one of the CIA&#8217;s favourites too.</p>
<p>The links don&#8217;t stop there.  One of Argo&#8217;s producers was George Clooney, who made <i>Syriana</i> (2007), based on former CIA officer Bob Baer&#8217;s experiences in the Middle East.  Clooney is also a <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=C" target="_blank">listed member</a> of the Council on Foreign Relations, perhaps the most influential foreign policy think tank in the US.  Before he got involved in CIA productions Affleck also starred in <i>Armageddon</i> (1998) and<i>Pearl Harbour</i> (2001), two action-disaster films that some people see as predictive programming for 9/11, the &#8216;new Pearl Harbour&#8217;.  Both films were made by whizz-bang closeupwobblecam merchant Michael Bay, and both were produced with <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article22893.htm" target="_blank">assistance from the Pentagon</a>.</p>
<p>If all this is making you wonder whether Hollywood is largely populated by CIA agents and whether Affleck himself is a CIA agent then you aren&#8217;t alone.  Fortunately, someone actually felt the need to ask Affleck about these issues:</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, according to Affleck &#8216;Probably, Hollywood is full of CIA agents&#8217; that we don&#8217;t know about.  However, it is perhaps more pertinent to focus our attention on the ones we do know about, such as Chase Brandon&#8217;s replacement Paul Barry.  He told Dr Tricia Jenkins that in his view, &#8216;Most Americans are content to accept Hollywood&#8217;s message. Very few ever conduct any research to determine the truth. This is reinforced to us by the public e-mail we receive. In most instances, Hollywood is the only way the public learns about the Agency and Americans frequently shape their judgments about us based on films.&#8217;</p>
<p>What can we do about this?  For one, by spotting the spooks in Hollywood we can show those people who do shape their judgments about the CIA based on films that they are being duped, and deliberately so.  The CIA is not a heroic, patriotic institution that wants to protect the lives of ordinary Americans and help spread peace and freedom, no matter how many Chase Brandon-aided films put phrases like that in their dialogue.  If they were such an institution then they wouldn&#8217;t have to employ people like Brandon and Barry to massage their image and weaponise the dream factories.  The very existence of people like Brandon and Barry tells us there&#8217;s a problem within the CIA, a problem Hollywood cannot solve.  For another, the likes of Affleck and Garner are not celebrities we should look up to, but are the pawns of professional deceivers and therefore probably deserve our pity.  At the very least we could stop paying for our own deception, and encourage others to stop paying for theirs.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/al-qaeda-militants-3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/al-qaeda-militants-2.jpg" align="left" /></a>Why does it cause such a disturbance for most comatose Americans, in the inconvenient truth that the US government has run various types of terror groups for decades?  It is an established fact, even in the mainstream media; any honest person must come to the conclusion that the United States has run terror groups from South America to Southeast Asia, from the Balkans to the Middle East. <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/al-qaeda-and-the-war-on-terrorism/7718">US financed terror groups</a> have operated in the past and in the present, including the wicked al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>During the 1980s American foreign policy consisted of funding and training terrorist organizations such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras">Contras</a> in Central America, and the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mujahideen">Mujahadeen</a> in Afghanistan which included Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda. Osama bin Laden was a well documented <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/binladen_cia.html">CIA asset</a> known as <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/bin_laden_osman.html">“Tim Osman”</a>, and his farcical death by the Obamanoids only served to mesmerize further a placid populace to the contrived illusion that there really was a bogyman called Osama bin Laden, and that there is in fact a real “war on terror”. Most of the personnel of Navy Seal Team Six that participated in the Bin Laden operation are now <a href="http://www.infowars.com/seal-team-6-families-to-blame-government-for-deaths/">conveniently dead</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Balkans</strong></p>
<p>Americans need to realize that the only real terror currently being perpetrated throughout the world is primarily orchestrated by the globalists in Washington and London. In the Yugoslavian wars of the 1990s <a href="http://www.balkanpeace.org/index.php?index=article&amp;articleid=12224">al-Qaeda</a> was operating in Bosnia, and in Kosovo. <a href="http://moderntokyotimes.com/2011/11/23/al-qaeda-bill-clinton-izetbegovic-killing-peacekeepers-in-bosnia/">Clinton’s cooperation with Balkan Islamists</a> in the 1990s clearly revealed that the United States government was using Islamic terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda to destabilize nations that were not under the direct influence of Western financiers.</p>
<p>The New World Order is real; it is being orchestrated not by governments but by central banks. Today governments do not run the world, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wHnzWyUsYI">Goldman Sacks runs the world</a>.</p>
<p>The Serbs lost their war against the globalists, and are now set to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11283616">enslave themselves into the European Union</a> and its debt based fiat system, an unfortunate result to their unsuccessful stand against the Western <a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/jesusandthemoneychangers3.jpg">money changers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Libya</strong></p>
<p>Who were the rebels that were <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20110307-libya-gaddafi-blames-al-qaeda-rejects-chavez-mediation-benghazi--deaths">fighting to overthrow</a> Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in Libya?  As early as 1996 <a href="http://http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2002/nov/10/uk.davidshayler">British Intelligence</a> paid large sums of money to an al-Qaeda cell in Libya in a failed assassination attempt on Gadaffi. The Observer reported that:</p>
<blockquote><p>the MI6 officers involved in the alleged plot were Richard Bartlett, who has previously only been known under the codename PT16 and had overall responsibility for the operation; and David Watson, codename PT16B. As Shayler&#8217;s opposite number in MI6, Watson was responsible for running a Libyan agent, &#8216;Tunworth&#8217;, who was providing information from within the cell. According to Shayler, MI6 passed £100,000 to the al-Qaeda plotters.</p>
<p>The assassination attempt on Gadaffi was planned for early 1996 in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte. It is thought that an operation by the Islamic Fighting Group in the city was foiled in March 1996 and in the gun battle that followed several militants were killed.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the largest rebel groups that fought to overthrow Gaddafi was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Islamic_Fighting_Group">Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG)</a>. LIFG was founded in 1995 by Libyans who had fought against Soviet forces in Afghanistan.  LIFG links to al-Qaeda hail from that war in Afghanistan. The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/5788302/Extremist-group-announces-split-from-al-Qaeda.html">Telegraph reported</a> that senior al-Qaeda members Abu Yahya al-Libi and Abu Laith al-Libi were LIFG members. One of al-Qaeda&#8217;s most senior members, Atiyah Abdul-Rahman, was purportedly a member of LIFG as well.</p>
<p>These are the so called rebels that the Obama administration along with bloodthirsty Senators like <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/38993/john-mccain-lindsey-graham-senators-demand-syria-intervention-encouraging-another-stupid-war">John McCain and Lindsay Graham</a> supported in their illegal war of aggression on Libya, signifying further evidence that the United States government runs al-Qaeda worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Syria</strong></p>
<p>The Obama administration took full advantage of the chaos they created in Libya, Obama and his <a href="http://http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/11/syria-al-qaeda-connection/2075323/">al-Qaeda allies</a> accumulated large caches of Libyan armaments. As a result, a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/libyan-weapons-al-qaeda-north-africa_n_2727326.html">flood of weapons</a> out of Libya is currently providing serious firepower to al-Qaeda militias across northern Africa and Syria.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi was coordinating the funneling of Libyan arms to al-Qaeda units fighting in Syria.  These arms also included shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles forcing the Syrian air force to conduct bombings from higher altitudes. How long will it be before we hear of a western jetliner being shot down by one of these missiles? Who will be blamed?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/arms-flow-syria-may-be-behind-beghazi-cover">Clarian Project reported</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the 2011 Libyan revolt against Muammar Qaddafi, reckless U.S. policy flung American forces and money into the conflict on the side of the rebels, who were known at the time to include Al Qaeda elements. Previously the number two official at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, Christopher Stevens was named as the official U.S. liaison to the Libyan opposition in March, 2011.</p>
<p>Stevens was tasked with helping to coordinate U.S. assistance to the rebels, whose top military commander, Abdelhakim Belhadj, was the leader of the Al Qaeda affiliate, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG). That means that Stevens was authorized by the U.S. Department of State and the Obama administration to aid and abet individuals and groups that were, at a minimum, allied ideologically with Al Qaeda.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ambassador Stevens’s coordination with al-Qaeda did not stop with the downfall of Qaddafi, by direction of the U.S. State Department it expanded to supply weapons and resources to Islamic terrorist organizations fighting the Assad government in Syria. This is of course <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/john-kerry-supports-al-qaeda-in-syria-in-violation-of-us-anti-terrorism-laws/5337650">highly illegal</a> and an obvious ‘act of war’ by the Obama administration against the Syrian people. This is the real Benghazi cover-up and scandal. It clearly exposes Obama as a war criminal and al-Qaeda as a vital instrument to that criminality.</p>
<p>Senator John McCain recently visited his al-Qaeda friends for a <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-rips-mccain-for-syrian-photo-op-oh-my-god-hes-literally-palling-around-with-terrorists/">photo op with the terrorists</a>. The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/05/30/un-adds-al-nusra-leading-opposition-force-fighting-in-syria-to-un-sanctions/">Al-Nusra Front or Jabhat al-Nusra</a> (Front of Defence for the People of Greater Syria&#8221;), is an Al Qaida associate operating in Syria. They were previously in Iraq killing American soldiers; they are responsible for many atrocities against Christian Syrians and other minorities. The Al-Nusra Front along with the Farouq Brigade are also responsible for <a href="http://rt.com/news/sarin-gas-turkey-al-nusra-021/">chemical attacks</a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2323858/Syrian-rebel-cuts-soldiers-heart-EATS-horrific-propaganda-video.html">gruesome body mutilations</a> against Syrian soldiers and civilians. These are the people <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article35177.htm">Senator McCain calls friends</a>, something he has done before in his nefarious past.</p>
<p>In the 1990s McCain <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j022500.html">associated himself with KLA terrorists</a> who are now engaged in <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/110322/kosovo-human-trafficking?page=full">human trafficking</a>, drug and <a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/12/koso-d29.html">organ dealing</a> in the Balkans. The murderous sex trade under KFOR supervision(<a href="http://college.lclark.edu/live/files/10776-1pdf">pdf</a>) that has inundated Europe can find its modern roots in the Balkan wars, and it seems that McCain never met bloodthirsty psychopaths he did not like in the past, and in the present.</p>
<p>Senator McCain illegally entered Syrian territory and vowed to continue the globalist onslaught against the people of Syria. Why are they so intent on destroying Syria’s sovereignty? Soon after the fall of Libya, Western <a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/jesus-and-the-money-changers3.jpg">money changers</a> installed a <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/wow-that-was-fast-libyan-rebels-have-already-established-a-new-central-bank-of-libya">central bank</a> controlled by them; if Syria falls the same fate awaits the Syrians.</p>
<p>At this point in time, the Syrian Army has the advantage militarily on the ground, and nothing short of NATO getting involved with a no-fly zone will be able to change that reality in the Syrian conflict. The terrorists are loosing the war, and the vast majority of the <a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/2013/05/31/nato-data-assad-winning-the-war-for-syrians-hearts-and-minds/">Syrian people</a> support the Syrian Army not the terrorists, an inconvenient truth that infuriates the global elite like John McCain.</p>
<p>The battle over Syria has become the front line against the NWO, and the globalists see Syria as a mere stepping stone to Iran. The road to Iran is through Damascus, and in geostrategic terms Iran is already fighting for its survival in Syria, the only real ally it has left in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Global Larceny</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/baldwin/baldwin431.htm">banksters</a> want to enslave all non-compliant sovereign nations, establishing <a href="http://www.oftwominds.com/blogjuly11/EU-debt-serfs-6-11.html">neo-serfdom</a> for the <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/debt-slaves">occupied peons</a> like they have managed to do in the West. It is wealth confiscation on a global scale, bankrupting all that they touch through flagrant larceny. They use the bogeyman al-Qaeda effectively, too frighten people into submission so they can invade one country after another, from Afghanistan too <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/frances-invasion-of-mali-a-carefully-planned-military-intervention/5325454">Mali</a>.</p>
<p>Real Americans no longer control the United States government; a criminal class of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy">kleptocratic</a> authoritarians has brought the United States to the brink of moral and financial bankruptcy. The illusion that al-Qaeda is coming to take your piece of the apple pie is what the globalists want you to believe, in the meantime they stick their hands down your pants looking for their friends, and you do nothing. You submit like Pavlovian lap dogs to the police state thinking that you will be safe and free, but you have been chemically castrated, and are already chained in the brain. So go to the mailbox and get your next batch of food stamps like a good obedient dog.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/hackedlondon3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/hackedlondon2.jpg" align="left" /></a><b>Jihadophilia</b> (/dʒɪˈhɑːdoˈfɪljə/) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder">mental disorder</a> affecting members of the Western (West European, North American and Anglo-Antipodean) elite class, mostly politicians, journalists, academics and civil servants. <b>J.</b> is characterized by a breakdown of the ability to name Muslims as perpetrators of the acts of Islamic terrorism, by the tendency to systematically ignore Islam as a factor in terrorist attacks or to deny its relevance in such attacks, and by an acute deficit of the capacity or will to provide appropriate institutional or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion">emotional</a> responses to such attacks.</p>
<p>Common symptoms of <b>J.</b> include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination">hallucinations</a>, usually in the form of an imaginary “peaceful and tolerant Islam,” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia">paranoid</a> or bizarre <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion">delusions</a>, usually in the form of “right-wing terrorists, white supremacists and Christian extremists,” and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_disorder">disorganized speech and thinking</a>, usually in the form of inappropriate and bizarre attempts to characterize acts of Islamic terrorism as  generic terrorist acts unmotivated by Jihad, or else not “terrorist” at all.</p>
<p>A recent example includes reactions in Britain to the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/05/23/man-killed-in-reported-machete-attack-in-london">gruesome murder</a> in London of a soldier by machete-wielding Muslims shouting <i>Allahu Akbar</i> on May 22. “We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you,” one of the attackers declared immediately after the attack in a video clip shown on the <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-05-22/exclusive-video-man-with-bloodied-hands-speaks-at-woolwich-scene/">ITV website</a>. “The only reason we have done this is because Muslims are dying every day. This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”</p>
<p>Prime Minister David Cameron subsequently admitted there were “indications” it was an act of terrorism, without indicating by whom. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police Commissioner, described the murder as “shocking and horrific,” without qualifying it. Counter-terrorism expert and former MI5 and MI6 official Richard Barrett allowed the possibility of some unnamed terrorist connection: “The idea that this may be terrorism-inspired by <b>some sort of religious extremist belief</b> [emphasis added] is quite plausible.” London Mayor <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> said that “the fault lies wholly and exclusively in the warped and deluded mindset of the people who did it.” He then urged London’s citizens to “go about their lives in the normal way.”</p>
<p>Only two days earlier, British Home Secretary <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/terror-law-boss-attacks-home-secretary-theresa-may-for-hiding-suspects-8623812.html">Theresa May was criticized</a> for refusing to reveal how many “terror suspects” (of unstated religious affiliation) are living in London under special rules to prevent them from carrying out attacks. David Anderson QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, had repeatedly called for the Government to publish the location, by region, of people subjected to Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures, but ministers are refusing to agree to the proposal, arguing that it might risk “compromising” their anonymity. The Home Office argued that the package of restrictions struck the “right balance” between protecting the public and the rights of the terror suspects. In view of the fact, reported by the BBC, that one of the machete attackers was arrested last year on his way to join al-Shabaab Islamic terrorist group in Somalia, striking the “right balance” comes at a cost, mostly of non-Muslim lives.</p>
<p>In the United States <b>J.</b> was manifested in President Obama’s initial reaction to the Boston bombings. Loath to imply a Muslim connection, he initially refused to use the word “terrorism.” Over the past four years he has banned the use of the words “Muslim” or “Islam” in the official American discourse on terrorism. By mandating the disconnect, he and his officials are displaying a mature form of the syndrome, as manifested in the Department of Defense’s classification of Maj. Hasan’ s Ft. Hood murders as “workplace violence.”</p>
<p>Institutional manifestations of <b>Jihadophilia</b> are evident in the Department of Homeland Security’s current anti-terrorism training guidelines, which pressure law enforcement officers to ignore Islamic faith of potential suspects when investigating terror crimes. Under the federal guidelines, agents are admonished to discount the possibility that a Muslim’s constitutionally protected disdain for the United States might possibly lead to violence. As a result, the Boston attack was carried out by a jihadist who had been investigated by the FBI, who was confirmed in 2011 to be a self-avowed Islamist—yet before the bombing, the FBI closed its file because it found this did not constitute “derogatory information” on Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Even if FBI operatives knew of Tsarnaev’s subsequent indoctrination journey to the Caucasus—and they were alerted by their Russian colleagues—they would not have restarted their 2011 investigation because of <b>J.</b></p>
<p><b>Jihadophilia</b> is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction, manifested in the inability or unwillingness of politicians to devise coherent anti-terrorist strategies or immigration policies, in the readiness of civil servants (including the military, national security and intelligence organizations) to comply with the delusional orders or guidelines for action, and the acceptance of the delusional paradigm by the media and the academe as reality. The onset of <b>J.</b> symptoms typically occurs upon the patient’s initiation into the ranks of the Western elite class, usually in young adulthood, with a global lifetime <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence">prevalence</a> of about 99 percent for the members of the said class, regardless of the patient’s party-political affiliation or self-reported ideological preferences. Such high percentage is due to the fact that any manifestation of the absence of <b>J.</b> in a member of the Western elite class invariably leads to the accusations of “Islamophobia” and “racism” and the exclusion of the healthy person from the ranks of that class.</p>
<p>Numerous examples of <b>J.</b>-initiated exclusion include Lt. Col. Matthew Dooley, a highly respected and decorated officer, who was fired in the wake of Muslim groups complaining about the approved course he taught on radical Islam at National Defense University. After 57 Islamic organizations complained to Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he displayed aggravated symptoms of <b>J.</b> when, in addition to ordering Dooley to be fired, he also ordered a negative Officer Evaluation Report against Dooley—the first such after 20 glowing annual reviews following his graduation from West Point. Earlier this year Dooley was punished again: Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, who is now head of U.S. Central Command, vetoed Dolley’s move to a battalion command position. His actions, for which no reason was given but <b>J.</b> is strongly indicated, effectively spell the end of Dooley’s career. According to Richard Thompson, president of the Thomas More Law Center who is representing Dooley, “The way they’re treating him now is not only a total miscarriage of justice on a personal level, but it also is really removing an effective combat leader from the Army, and it ultimately affects the national security of the United States.” Thomson adds that Army leaders willingly threw Dooley “under the bus for their own advancement or to appease the Muslims, which ultimately could lead to the destruction of the United States internally. If we cannot accurately describe who the enemy is, how can we win a war?” (Thompson’s question clearly indicated the absence of <b>J.</b> which may make his own long-term position at the TMLC uncertain.)</p>
<p>More recently, Gregory Hicks, the Deputy Mission Chief in Tripoli, was penalized by J. sufferers for refusing to go along with the Administration’s delusional claim that the jihadist attack in Benghazi last September 11 was the result of a spontaneous demonstration triggered off by an &#8220;anti-Islamic&#8221; amateur video. Within weeks, he received a &#8220;blistering critique&#8221; of his management from his J.-affected superiors at the Department of State.</p>
<div>
<p><b>Jihadophilia</b> diagnosis is based on observed behavior and on the reported experiences of the victims of J.-affected patients’ acts. The clinical anamnesis of <b>J.</b> usually includes terminal de-Christianization, <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0004-282X2001000500001&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=es">frontopolar and anterior temporal cortex degeneracy</a>, and dependence on the mainstream media and mass culture in forming the Weltanschauung, but early-age political and social indoctrination appear to be important contributory factors. In particular, exposure to university education—especially at one of the leading institutions—appears to worsen <b>J.</b> symptoms. Some current research on <b>J.</b> is focused on the contributory role of Saudi money, although no single isolated “quantitative” cause has been found. The many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes, such as the <i>Weiningerian self-hate syndrome</i> articulated by Dr. S. Trifkowitz in the 1990’s.</p>
<p>People with <b>Jihadophilia </b>are likely to have additional (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity">comorbid</a>) conditions, including advocacy of “immigration reform” (i.e. <i>amnesty</i>) and “gay marriage,” as well as the lifetime occurrence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder">substance use disorder</a>, primarily of power (as described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalberg-Acton,_1st_Baron_Acton">John Dalberg, 1<sup>st</sup> Baron Acton</a>), but the secondary propensity to graft should not be neglected. The disorder initially affects <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition">cognition</a>, but <b>J’s</b> behavioral consequences invariably lead to chronic morbidities, such as the native European and European-descended population replacement by the unassimilable—in Europe’s case overwhelmingly Muslim—immigrant communities.</p>
<p>The mainstay of <b>Jihadophilia</b> treatment is still in the development stage. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy">Psychotherapy</a> and vocational and social rehabilitation are believed to be ineffective. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_psychiatry">Involuntary hospitalization</a> will be necessary when the social and political conditions make <b>J’s</b> long-overdue effective treatment methods possible, probably a decade or two from now.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/targeting-syria-and-iran3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/targeting-syria-and-iran2.jpg" align="left" /></a>This eminently Bushist Obama &#8220;red line&#8221; business, applied to Syria, Iran or both, is becoming a tad ridiculous.</p>
<p>Take Pentagon head Chuck Hagel&#8217;s tour of Israel and the &#8220;friendly&#8221; GCC (the de facto Gulf Counter-revolution Club) last week. US defense contractors had the Moet flowing as Hagel merrily congregated with that prodigy of democracy &#8211; United Arab Emirates (UAE) Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed &#8211; to celebrate the sale of 25 F-16 fighter jets.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more on the way; 48 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD missile interceptors, at a cool US$1 billion. The Pentagon is sending one of its only two of such systems to Guam this month to counter that other threat &#8211; missiles from North Korea.</p>
<p>The weaponizing free fest to Israel and the Gulf petro-monarchies &#8211; missile defense, fighter jets, mega-bombs &#8211; could not but be duly hailed as the proverbial &#8220;message&#8221; to &#8220;counter Iran&#8217;s nuclear ambitions&#8221;, or &#8220;the air and missile threat posed by Iran&#8221;, or the general &#8220;worry about Iran&#8217;s pursuit of a nuclear weapon&#8221; or &#8220;Washington&#8217;s determination to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no &#8220;red line&#8221; here; just hardcore weaponizing of Israel and the GCC. Any doubts, blame it on Iran. And this while Saudi-controlled media in the Middle East &#8211; roughly everything except al-Jazeera &#8211; was breathlessly spinning that Tel Aviv is pursuing a deal to use Turkish soil for an attack on Iran.</p>
<p>Wait; there&#8217;s more weaponizing on the way &#8211; bound to neighboring latitudes. Kraus-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) from Germany closed another $2.48 billion deal with Qatar &#8211; five years in the making &#8211; to deliver 62 Leopard 2 tanks and 24 self-propelled howitzers. Qatar is not exactly using them for the 2022 FIFA World Cup; they are bound to &#8220;friendly groups in other countries&#8221; &#8211; as in Syria&#8217;s &#8220;rebels&#8221;, via Turkey.</p>
<p><b>Ask the Nenets </b></p>
<p>Now take the Syria chemical weapons charade. The White House now seems to be convinced that the CIA believes, with &#8220;varying degrees of confidence&#8221;, that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons. Secretary of State John Kerry &#8211; an &#8220;intervention&#8221; cheerleader posing as a dove &#8211; was already convinced.</p>
<p>But then Hagel said, &#8220;Suspicions are one thing; evidence is another.&#8221; Just to flip-flop a little while later, during his visit to Israel, he became convinced Bashar al-Assad was using sarin gas. Of course; after all, Hagel finally had unimpeded access to Israeli &#8211; not US &#8211; intel.</p>
<p>And now for the beauty of Hagel&#8217;s marketing; what about embarking as a traveling salesman to &#8220;our bastards&#8221; with a sales pitch of &#8221; Look, Iran and Syria are both crazy, you might consider stacking up on this, this and this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nenets of Siberia &#8211; crossing the Ob river to enter the Arctic Circle &#8211; could teach a thing or two about real strategy to those limping armchair warriors in US Think Tankland. Even the Nenets would know that the current chemical weapons hysteria is a total fabrication by the CIA, MI6 and Israeli intelligence &#8211; corroborated by zero evidence. Still, the prevailing Washington &#8220;wisdom&#8221; is that a &#8220;red line&#8221; must be enforced over Syria so a &#8220;red line&#8221; must be enforced on Iran.</p>
<p>The fact is that the al-Assad government initially accused the &#8220;rebels&#8221; of using chemical weapons &#8211; and asked the United Nations for an official investigation.</p>
<p>Even the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/world/middleeast/syria-developments.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;">New York Times</a> was forced, grudgingly, to admit the &#8220;rebels&#8221; acknowledged an attack happened in territory controlled by the government, with 16 Syrian Army dead, plus 10 civilians and over a hundred injured. But then the &#8220;rebels&#8221; changed the narrative, blaming Damascus of bombing their own soldiers. It was Moscow that introduced a measure of reality, detailing how Washington was stalling the UN investigation.</p>
<p>Our Nenets of Siberia would also know there&#8217;s hardly anything secular leading the &#8220;rebels&#8221; in Syria; it&#8217;s a motley crew of varying degrees of fanaticism. Once again, the Nenets would not need to freeze to death reading the New York Times to find out that the CIA is &#8220;secretly&#8221; funneling a free for all weaponizing to the &#8220;rebels&#8221; via Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Still the Obama administration peddles the fiction that Washington only supplies &#8220;non lethal&#8221; aid as Capitol Hill nutters keep insisting that Obama install a &#8220;no fly zone&#8221; over Syria &#8211; as in Libya-style NATO war remix.</p>
<p><b>Follow-on strike package, anyone? </b></p>
<p>US Think Tankland nonetheless is ecstatic that the GCC petro-monarchies now have access to precision-guided munitions to &#8220;strike Iranian targets&#8221;.</p>
<p>But nothing compares to the cheerleading of Israel&#8217;s new access to KC-135 aerial refueling tankers &#8211; or Stratotankers. Then there&#8217;s the imminent transfer of anti-radiation missiles as well &#8211; advanced versions of the AGM-88 HARM missiles. These toys will &#8220;reduce the threat to Israel&#8217;s follow-on strike package.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, this is not exactly about &#8220;US circumspection&#8221;, or &#8220;US resolve in the campaign against Iranian nuclear weapons&#8221;; it&#8217;s unqualified Dog of War barking.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, that police state run by King Playstation, also known as Jordan, has opened its airspace to Israeli drones now engaged in &#8220;monitoring&#8221; Syria.</p>
<p>As Asia Times Online has repeatedly warned, Obama in Syria is fast becoming a remix of Reagan in 1980s Afghanistan. We all know what came out of those &#8220;freedom fighters&#8221; afterwards. In this context, Robert Ford, Obama&#8217;s alleged Syria expert, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that it&#8217;s important for Washington to &#8220;weigh in&#8221; to affect &#8220;the internal balance of power in Syria&#8221; qualifies as a joke line, not a red line.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s wild speculation that after the Boston bombing Obama and Russia&#8217;s Vladimir Putin made a deal; Washington lets Moscow do whatever it wants in Chechnya like, forever, but gets a nod to install a &#8220;no-fly zone&#8221; and further mayhem in Syria. There&#8217;s no evidence to that. What a geopolitically savvy Putin wants to know is what does he get out of Syria in practical terms (and Obama does not have a clue). Crumbs from a NATO banquet don&#8217;t apply.</p>
<p>As for allowing Syria to become a &#8220;Western-friendly&#8221; Wahhabi emirate or yet another failed Muslim Brotherhood fiefdom, one needs to go no further than Hezbollah&#8217;s <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article34777.htm">Sheikh Nasrallah</a> &#8230; &#8220;the goal of anyone standing behind the war in Syria, is destroying Syria so that a strong, centralized state would not be established in it, and so that it would become too weak to take decisions related to its oil, sea, or borders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s what a red line is all about.</p>

			<p><strong>Excerpt from The Master Plan</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/agenda-21-trojan-horse3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.veracityvoice.com/images/agenda-21-trojan-horse2.jpg" align="left" /></a>“My father and his colleague’s findings were staggering. At first, I thought he might have been mistaken, but as I studied the facts, I noticed a subtle, methodical agenda weaving its way throughout the whole affair. After thoroughly examining all of the documents, I was forced to agree with his conclusions.</p>
<p align="left">“Father&#8217;s reports contained photocopies of documents and maps that came out of the United Nations conferences and the Convention on Biological Diversity. It was categorized under a project entitled Agenda 21 and the subsection, Sustainable Development. Harsh policies restricting people&#8217;s rights and liberties were ratified through international agreements and treaties. Every member of the United Nations was bond by this agreement.</p>
<p align="left">“What was happening in Africa was a mirror of what was taking place all over the world, especially America. After connecting all the dots, there was an obvious plan to reduce the world&#8217;s population, seize control of large landmasses, and confine humans to designated island areas.</p>
<p align="left">“America is a nation with many states, yet united under one national head. Africa is a continent, with many independent, separate countries, and according to the United Nations report, the goal regarding Africa and the Middle East was to exploit their vast resources.</p>
<p align="left">“Representatives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank were sent to the heads of countries rich in natural resources. The process involved an offer to transform the country into the modern, 21st century. Repayment for these transformation loans were in the form of natural resources and taxable labor. If a country’s leader rejected the bank’s offer of eternal indebtedness, the CIA, MI6 or a like agency was used to overthrow the leader by whatever means necessary. If those attempts failed, NATO Peacekeeping Forces were deployed to defend the hired rebels and depose the nation’s leader.</p>
<p align="left">“The international media always supported the rebel forces under the banner of democracy. So out of ignorance the public also supported the rebel forces and their supposed battle for freedom. The resisting leader was dethroned and replaced with a tyrannical shill for the international bankers whose sole intent was to exploit the country and the people. This was happening all over Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p align="left">“At this time, my father and I noticed government-instituted, United Nations family planning centers cropping up in surrounding towns. These family planners held town hall meetings and presented videos that strongly advocated vaccines, contraceptives, sterilization and abortions. These videos were mere propaganda pieces to convince the people to be a participant in the family planners’ program of infanticide. As an inducement, they offered medical supplies and food rations.”</p>
<p align="left">“Why are you calling it infanticide?” I interrupted. “At least one organization was making a sincere effort to address the people’s needs.”</p>
<p align="left">“Killing a three week old infant in the womb or a three year old child is infanticide, Lance.” she retorted. “They were teaching the women that a three years old child was no different than an unborn fetus, since both were unable to make knowledgeable decisions.</p>
<p align="left">“With no questions asked, a mother could deliver her three years old child, or younger, to the United Nations Planners for termination,” Monique responded with disdain.</p>
<p align="left">“Africans have always believed in large families, possessed strong family ties and heterosexuality relationships. Under normal conditions, Africans would never agree to be sterilized, and they certainly would not hand over their children to be murdered. With Africa a warzone, the family planners successfully targeted the hardest hit areas.”</p>
<p align="left">“I see your point. Couldn’t your father or his associates intervene?” I probed.</p>
<p align="left">“They tried,” she answered. “This was all part of the United Nations Agenda 21, population control program. But the African project, which was pure eugenics, was special; it was being assisted with funds from billion dollar tax-exempt foundations whose founders controlled large companies and held the purse strings of governments around the world. The sole objective was to reduce the world’s population. According to their own figures, they wanted to eliminate ninety percent of the population, with Africa and the Middle East their number one targets.”</p>
<p align="left">“What was the world’s population at that time?” I asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Oh, roughly eight and a half billion people,” she quipped.</p>
<p align="left">“So we’re talking about five hundred million people left on the planet when they get through with us,” I countered.</p>
<p align="left">“Yes, approximately five hundred million; but we found some foundations demanding it be reduced to one hundred million. With that small number of people on earth, they claimed, they would be able to procreate as they pleased, they would have the freedom to travel anywhere on the globe un-accosted by commoners, and the whole world would be their playground.”</p>
<p align="left">“That is an awful lot of people to kill, and then bury,” I exclaimed.</p>
<p align="left">“The documents my father discovered provided detailed accounts that every war within the past one hundred years was orchestrated to bankrupt the nations and reduce the population. And yet, war had not significantly decreased the population to their satisfaction.</p>
<p align="left">“The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) provided planning centers with clinics that administered vaccinations. These centers had a list of everyone’s name living in that vicinity. These centers were guarded by the military who administered server punishment to anyone who refused to be vaccinated. We soon discovered that most of the vaccines were laced with various diseases.</p>
<p align="left">“Father began to advance his research, and his findings revealed documented proof that HIV, along with a number of other viruses had been engineered. Under the cloak of germ warfare, Congress funded a project to find a virus capable of deteriorating the human immune system. During the developmental stages, they grafted an assortment of animal viruses that had been mutated in monkeys and chimpanzees. These viruses were eventually cultured with human cells and ultimately injected into human genes. The final result was a number of very powerful, independent viruses commingled into one. What makes AIDS extremely difficult to eradicate, is the number of individual viruses constituting different strains. Father was also able to locate a patent for the cure of AIDS.</p>
<p align="left">“The strain of AIDS introduced into Africa was far more infectious than strains found elsewhere. It was also discovered that the Negroid gene had a predilection to HIV. In some areas of the African continent, seventy-five percent of the people had tested HIV positive, and in other areas, as high as one hundred percent.</p>
<p align="left">“We also learned that most incidents of HIV positive were not being transmitted through homosexual relationships or promiscuous sexual encounters as disseminated by the press. But instead, HIV, as well as other viruses and diseases were being transmitted through the forced immunization program. This was discovered when seven year old children were testing positive for HIV, yet neither parent was found to be HIV positive.</p>
<p align="left">“Included in this genocide called Societal Cleansing was the culling of the genetically inferior, such as morons, misfits, the maladjusted and the aged. Senior citizens were terminated at fifty years old to prevent a financial and psychological burden on society. This also prevented senior citizen’s opposing and archaic views from being passed on to younger generations.</p>
<p align="left">“The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was the agency chosen to administer this societal cleansing. This involved restructuring the cities of the world, protecting the ecology against the destructive forces of modern society and the implementation of social equity and the restructuring of life itself. This all fell under the UN Agenda 21’s Sustainable Development program.</p>
<p align="left">“Broad and unbridled authority was given to the EPA to prevent humans from draining the earth’s limited resources. This monstrous plan included every facet of life. Man was considered the most dangerous, destructive, selfish and unethical creature on Mother Earth.</p>
<p align="left">“The law enforcement agency to protect Mother Earth was called the Green Police; they had inclusive authorization to confiscate personal belongings, shut down businesses or operations, and kill anyone that interfered with their agenda.</p>
<p align="left">“The EPA’s Agenda 21 manual, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><em>Global warming, the depletion of fuel, water, food, and the like, is the direct cause of human intervention. The real enemy is humanity itself. The damage people cause the planet is a function of demographics equal to the degree of development. The ecological crisis was really the population crisis. Cut the population by ninety-plus percent and you stop injuring the earth by an equal amount.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">With tongue-in-cheek, I interrupted, “I wonder if any of the UN leaders are willing to sacrifice their lives, or the lives of their children or grandchildren in order to save the earth from the blight of human existence?”</p>
<p align="left">“Well,” she continued, “the presupposition is that Mother Earth has the capacity to regulate or heal herself under natural conditions. But the human species has developed technology to overwhelm the earth&#8217;s capacity to heal herself, and she is therefore doomed to destruction unless humans are stopped from their technological assault.</p>
<p align="left">“They depict humans as zombies that must be exterminated to stop their destructive behavior to the earth. The association between human beings and zombies is particularly directed against those that reject Globalism and the Global Warming restructuring programs of the earth, its galactic surroundings, and all life forms are the controlling factors behind this thrust to reduce the population. Those that don’t believe in these programs are portrayed as none-human zombies that exist to consume all they can to satisfy only themselves. But the real reason for this push for population reduction is so that they can have the world as their playground.</p>
<p align="left">“This environmental hocus-pocus merely provided justification for their claim that the population of the world was increasing too quickly, and in order to stabilize the population, at least 350,000 people a day had to be eliminated. Although I agree that the world is over populated, I do not believe killing 350,000 people a day is the solution to the problem.”</p>
<p align="left">I quickly interrupted, “Monique, It’s a fact that the entire population of the world can live comfortably in the State of Texas on an acre per person. So, killing 350,000 people under the pretext of over population is insanity. They’ve purposely herded the masses into the major cities to create the illusion that we’re running out of space and resources, but we’re not. If they’re so bent on reducing the population, I suggest they start with themselves!”</p>
<p align="left">“Most of their efforts,” she continued without comment, “were directed toward the United States. They attributed much of the earth&#8217;s devastation to Americans&#8217; standard of living, such as industrialization and their usage of air and earth contaminating products. They claimed that one American burdens the earth more than twenty people from an undeveloped country. I thought it was strange that China was never mentioned, although they are the largest polluters on the planet; it might be due to the fact that they introduced the one child policy.</p>
<p align="left">“It was through the land management policies under Agenda 21 that they confiscated the best areas of the countries and designated them under Biosphere Reserves and World Heritage Sites. All major ecosystems in a region were reserved. To protect these ecosystems, buffer zones were established around them. They defined a buffer zone as an area surrounding any property with restrictions on its use. During the mid-1990s, the United States president donated most of America’s National parks and lands under the Bureau of Land Management, National Rivers and Streams to the United Nations for protection.</p>
<p align="left">“Likewise, the continent of Africa was charted and then divided into major ecosystems for reserve. These conterminous States were encompassed in core reserves with inner corridor zones, which created a wilderness network that dominated a region with human habitations being small islands. They designated a half of the continent as wilderness areas with another fourth as buffer zones. These stringent policies grossly restricted human activity. People lived on small islands communities, they could only travel on the thoroughfares connecting the island communities, and they could never trespass into the buffer zones since they protected the delicate ecosystems. This was being done under a religious hypothesis of protecting Mother Earth against the destructive actions of mankind.”</p>

</div>
<p>While Israel believes that the road to Tehran is a straight “pre-emptive” military attack super-highway, the US and UK seem to believe that the road to Tehran runs through Damascus.</p>
<p>This might explain the growing turmoil in Syria that’s being used to try to promote a Libya-like UN Security Council resolution which, if passed, would certainly have Libya-like results…</p>
<p>In recent days, there has been horrific violence in the Syrian city of Homs, as more than 200 people have died in gunfights and bombings. For the Western mainstream media, all the blame lies with Bashar al-Assad’s government, with President Obama spelling out the official line: “<em>Assad must halt his campaign of killing and crimes against his own people now. He must step aside and allow a democratic transition to proceed immediately.</em>”  The Western Allies’ strategy of encroachment on Syria and Iran seems to run in parallel and sequentially.  Its logic is: if Syria falls, Iran will follow.</p>
<p>As with Iraq and Libya, the US, UK and France tried to impose a UN Security Council resolution laying all the blame on the government, and calling for its immediate resignation.  Only this time they’ve been vetoed by Russia and China, who are standing up to the west’s global bullying tactics.</p>
<p>No small matter indeed!  For it hinges on how the western allies on one side, and the Russians and Chinese on the other understand the root causes of violence and turmoil in Syria and, by extension, throughout the region.  On Syria, the official US/UK/French/Israeli line is that the “Arab Spring” has finally reached Syria. In their usual Hollywoodesque boxing match-like “Good Guys versus Bad Guys” worldview, they seem to tell global public opinion, “in this corner we have heroic freedom-fighters trying to bring “democracy” (US brand, of course!) to Syria; in that corner, we have the mean, fundamentalist antidemocratic Assad regime repressing the people”. It might sound like a great script for some teary-eyed Stephen Spielberg thriller, but the real world isn’t like that…</p>
<p>Rather than saying it’s simply the Assad government turning against its people, Russia and China take a more balanced stance on the internal affairs of Syria, where several factions are in conflict. There are the legal authorities of Syria, and there are armed terrorist throngs taking advantage of genuine social grievances and unleashing violence throughout the country, which in turn triggers police repression.   With lesser intensity, similar scenes can also been seen on the streets of London, Manchester, New York, Oakland, Athens and other western cities.</p>
<p>In Syria, such groups are in all likelihood profusely armed, trained, financed and abetted by foreign players, pointing straight at US, UK, French and Israeli intelligence entities: public, private, official, unofficial, overt and covert.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a much more complex view than Washington’s and London’s easier-to-grasp Walt Disney version of reality with its “bad cat fighting good Tweety Bird” rhetoric.</p>
<p>The UN resolution the western allies are trying to get imposed on Syria is based on a report and proposal emanating from the Arab League under its present Secretary General Nabyl El Araby, which has regressed into a pro-western political and diplomatic tool.  Something similar happened to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under its present Director General Yukiya Amano, as it recently produced a damning report on Iran´s nuclear program based on “intelligence from member states”, implicitly, the US, UK, France and Israel.</p>
<p>What’s happening in Syria today is very bad news for the Syrians, who are becoming the victims of western-style state-sponsored terrorism.  Alas! It is, however good news for the rest of the world. And it has made Russia and China stand up to the US, UK, France and Israel: Russia and China are not ready to tolerate a re-run of Iraq and Libya.</p>
<p>It seems today’s foremost geopolitical problem is that the forces running the United States, United Kingdom, France and Israel are increasingly out of control.  They have no qualms in risking global nuclear war if that’s what it takes to achieve their political, financial – even Messianic! – objectives.  They clearly must be stopped.</p>
<p>A year ago, the western allies launched clandestine operations triggering the so-called Arab Spring, which has brought hundreds of thousands of deaths, injuries, and the destruction and demise of Libya.<br />
Would the western allies dare to include Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine in their list of Arab Spring countries, recommending that they too rise up in arms against their invaders?</p>
<p>Syria is yet another example of western double standards. The west complains about Bashar al-Assad fighting the very terrorists they finance, but says nothing when Israel launches cluster and phosphorus bombs over Gaza’s civilians.  They overran Libya “to protect civilians”, but discretely looked the other way when their Egyptian military semi-allies repressed the people, kicking young women senseless on the streets of Cairo.</p>
<p>As US President Franklyn D Roosevelt once replied when an aide pointed out to him that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza was a complete SOB: “Yes! He is a SOB, but he’s our SOB…!”<br />
Right now, Syria is being dragged towards civil war.  Can we believe everything the western media report and western governments parrot?   Remember the “take-out-Saddam-if-you-don’t-want-to-see-a-mushroom-cloud-over-one-of-our-cities” rhetoric?</p>
<p>Today, Syrian news agency SANA gives a very different story on the Homs episode, reporting that “<em>armed terrorist groups on Monday attacked citizens and law-enforcement members at several areas in Homs… the authorities were pursuing and clashing with them.  Armed terrorist groups exploded two explosive devices behind the building of the Technical Services at al-Dablan Neighborhood in Homs.  Terrorists also shelled with mortars several quarters in Homs, while others broke into houses in Idleb Governorates. A number of citizens escaped from an armed terrorist group to a mosque in Rastan City, where the armed terrorist group burnt the mosque, killing and injuring some of the citizens</em>”.  Why doesn’t the western media report this?</p>
<p>Think of it: if Mossad, the CIA and MI6 are suspected of assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists on the streets of Tehran in veritable exercises of blatant state-sponsored terrorism, couldn’t they be doing this on a much vaster scale inside Syria?</p>
<p>Every time we see horrendous, yet unclear, violence – whether in Egypt, Syria, Iran, Libya, 9/11 in New York or 7 July in London, – two key factors must be unraveled: (1) who benefits? (2) follow the money (who’s paying for the bombs, logistics, bullets, satellite and drone support?)</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Perhaps the US, UK and France want to attack Iran, going first through Syria.<br />
Perhaps Israel wants to attack Iran, going directly at it.<br />
Probably, these are two sides of the same coin…</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/carrier-aircraft-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/carrier-aircraft-2.jpg" alt="" align="left" /></a>2011 will be remembered as the year the US, Britain, France and Israel went into Imperial Overdrive in North Africa and the Middle East. Will 2012 be remembered as the year those same Western Allies unleashed World War III?</p>
<p>It is not news anymore to say that the West will soon attack Iran, maybe Syria. They have been threatening to do that for years now, certainly ever since the failed Israeli invasion into Southern Lebanon in mid-2006, when they were routed by Hezbollah.</p>
<p>So what is different today? For starters, general circumstances have changed dramatically in the Region. Genuine popular dissent inside key Muslim countries has been used by the Western Allies to train, fund and arm local criminal and terrorist organizations, dubbed “freedom fighters”, as their proxies.</p>
<p>Country after country has fallen victim to the CIA’s, MI6’s and Mossad’s “dirty tricks departments”, and other Western-style terrorist organizations. Results range from moderate “regime change” in Tunisia and Algeria; via horrendous “violence by our boys” in Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain; all the way to outright military attack, civil war and political assassination. Such as the one in Libya, where Hillary Clinton boisterously laughed when she learned Muammar Gaddafi had been murdered live on TV by “her thugs”.</p>
<p>The whole region has been set on fire. Not that other regions of the world are not on fire too; however the pyrotechnics used by the Global Power Elite vary in nature in each geography. For example, Europe, the US and Britain are being set alight using financial terrorism resembling a neutron bomb, which kills people off while leaving assets and banks standing.</p>
<p>Now in Iran the stage seems set for a final show-down. It has taken so long only because Israeli, British and US planners are not stupid; they know that messing with Iran is not like messing with Iraq or Pakistan or Afghanistan or Libya. Messing with Iran will bring Western Allies very dangerously close to messing with Russia and China. If I were in their shoes, I would not do that. Unless…</p>
<p>Unless World War III is what they are looking for. Now, why would they do that?  Perhaps, because they have realized that there is just no peaceful way of achieving their dream of World Government. Perhaps because they have understood that the financial quicksand they have backed themselves into is so devastating that it cannot be cleaned up with purely financial, monetary and “legal” measures, in which case…</p>
<p>Nothing beats a good war! Perhaps, because wildcard Israel is so very much in control (or should I say, out of control) that they are imposing the “Sampson Option” not only on themselves, but also on their controlled Western Allies and the whole planet if need be.<em> “After me, the Flood!”</em></p>
<p>Things in the Strait of Hormuz are extremely dangerous and volatile. After being systematically threatened with unilateral military attack, invasion, and even nuclear strikes, now the Iranians are showing their muscle too. On 24th December, Iran began a 10-day spate of military maneuvers in the strait that has all but put the US, UK and Israel on red alert. A US aircraft carrier force is now in the area and their helicopters have flown dangerously close to Iranian forces. Any spark could set off a conflagration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Syria is falling into meltdown. Meanwhile, Israel is preparing “Cast Lead II” over and inside Gaza. Meanwhile, Hezbollah is ready to strike Israel with tens of thousands of very deadly short-range “Katyushka” rockets.</p>
<p>A key sign of impending war is an article just published in the January/February 2012 issue of Foreign Affairs, the official journal of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). It carried the ominous title of Time to Attack Iran: Why a Strike Is the Least Bad Option, by Matthew Kroenig. This man was, until last July, special advisor to the Pentagon for “Defense Strategy on Iran” – Newspeak for<em> “let’s beat the hell out of Iran”.</em></p>
<p>The CFR is the key Global Power Elite think-tank, founded in 1919 together with its London sister organization, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (also known as Chatham House). Its more than 4500 members are deeply embedded into the uppermost echelons of public and private power in the US, controlling banking, industry, media, academia, the military and government.</p>
<p>Key government posts are always controlled by one of their lot, irrespective of whether the Democrats or Republicans are in power. The CFR is integrated into an intricate network of similar organizations that includes the Trilateral Commission, Brookings Institution, American Enterprise Group, Project for a New American Century, Bilderberg and others. They all operate in streamlined coordination, consistency, synchronization and – most important – with a common purpose.</p>
<p>In his article, Mr Kroenig, assesses how<em> “American pundits and policymakers have been debating whether the United States should attack Iran and attempt to eliminate its nuclear facilities,” </em>concluding that,<em> “The only thing worse than military action against Iran would be an Iran armed with nuclear weapons.”</em></p>
<p>He warns against <em>“skeptics of military action (who) fail to appreciate the true danger that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to US interests in the Middle East and beyond.”  </em></p>
<p>This reflects Defense Secretary Leon Panetta’s recent remarks when addressing the Brookings Institution’s pro-Israel “Saban Forum” bringing together US and Israeli military strategists that repeated the usual Baby Bush “all options are on the table” threats.</p>
<p>Mr. Kroenig talks of the <em>“dangers of deterrence” </em>and gives the Obama Administration unequivocal advice: <em>“The truth is that a military strike intended to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, if managed carefully, could spare the region and the world a very real threat and dramatically improve the long-term national security of the United States.”</em></p>
<p>As these pyromaniacs get ready to ignite the regional and global powder keg, one key question looms ever larger: what will Russia do?</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/clocks-reuters3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/clocks-reuters2.jpg" align="left" /></a>The Private Global Power Elite embedded in major governments is dead set on imposing World Government on us sooner rather than later. Let’s look at 12 mega-processes – veritable “Triggers” – that we infer they are using to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>All roads lead to World Government.  This should come as no surprise.  London’s Financial Times openly articulated this view in an article by their chief foreign affairs commentator, Gideon Rachman, published on 8 December 2009, whose title said it all: “And Now for a World Government.” These goals are echoed by the Trilateral Commission, CFR and Bilderberg insiders – even by the Vatican.</p>
<p>Macro-managing planet Earth is no easy matter. It requires strategic and tactical planning by a vast think-tank network allied to major elite universities whereby armies of academics, operators, lobbyists, media players and government officers interface, all abundantly financed by the global corporate and banking superstructure.</p>
<p>They do this holistically, knowing that they operate on different stages moving at very different speeds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial Triggers move at lightning speed thanks to electronic information technology that can make or break markets, currencies and entire countries in just hours or days;</li>
<li>Economic Triggers move slower: manufacturing cars, aircraft, food, clothes, building plants and houses takes months;</li>
<li>Political Triggers tied to the “democratic system” put politicians in power for several years;</li>
<li>Cultural Triggers require entire generations to implement; this is where PsyWar has reached unprecedented “heights”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Risk-managing this whole process takes into account the many pitfalls and surprises in store.  So each plan in every field counts, with “Plan B’s” – even Plans “C” and “D” – which can be implemented if needed.</p>
<h3>Twelve Triggers for World Government</h3>
<p>Today, the Global Power Elite are wrapping up globalization and ushering in World Government.  Paraphrasing the tightrope walker in German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” this implies “….a dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting…&#8221;</p>
<p>These 12 Triggers are interlinked and interlocked in a highly complex, holistic matrix, very flexible in its tactics but rigidly unbending in its strategic objectives. When read as a whole, the picture that unfolds shows that whole being far more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>1) Financial Meltdown. Since 2008, the Global Financial System continues on life-support. Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner and the US economic hit team – Robert Rubin, Larry Summers and Goldman Sachs, CitiGroup, JPMorganChase mega-bankers working with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank – have not and will not take any measures to help the populace and ailing economies.  They just funnel trillions to the banking elite, imposing the media myth that certain banks are “too big to fail” (Orwellian Newspeak for “too damn powerful to fail”). Why? Because it’s not governments overseeing, supervising and controlling Goldman Sachs, CitiCorp, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, JPMorganChase, but exactly the other way around…</p>
<p>2) Economic Crises.  Today, “Destructive Extreme Capitalism” is collapsing national and regional economies, reformatting them into international slave-labour Gulag-like entities that Joseph Stalin would envy.   Our woes lie not with the world’s real economy (mostly intact), but with the fake world of finance, banks, and speculation;</p>
<p>3) Social Upheavals.  Meltdowns in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Iceland and – soon to come – Italy, Spain and others, trigger violent social uprisings, even in the US and UK;</p>
<p>4) Pandemics.  Get ready for more “flu surprises” leading to mandatory vaccinations: a discreet opportunity to slip RFID chips into our bodies and test “intelligent viruses” targeting specific DNA strains.  Racially and ethnically selective viruses as part of mass depopulation campaigns?</p>
<p>5) Global Warming. As the global economy sinks into zero growth mode, economic drivers shift from growth expansion to consumption contraction. Will coming “carbon credits” open the path to full societal control?</p>
<p>6) Terrorist “False Flag” Mega-Attacks. The Elite have this wildcard up their sleeve to jump-start new “crises” as short-cuts towards world government.  Will new “attacks” dwarfing 9/11 justify further global wars, invasions and genocide?  A nuclear weapon over a major city to be blamed on the Elite’s “enemies”?</p>
<p>7) Generalized War in the Middle East. As we speak, naval forces, bombers, entire armies are poised to attack and invade Syria, Iran…</p>
<p>8 ) Ecological/Environmental “Accidents”. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident sparked the beginning of the end of the former USSR by showing the world and the Soviets themselves that their State could no longer manage their own nuclear facilities.  April 2010 saw the BP “Deepwater Horizon” oil rig eco-catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico; since March 2011, Japan and the world have been grappling with a much larger nuclear accident in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex.  Was foul play involved?</p>
<p>9) Assassination of a major political or religious figure to be blamed on an Elite enemy.  Mossad, CIA, MI6 are really good at playing this type of dirty trick;</p>
<p>10) Attacks on “Rogue States” – Iraq, Libya… Who’s next? Iran? Syria?  Venezuela?  North Korea?</p>
<p>11) Staged “Religious” Event. The growing need of the masses for meaning in their lives makes them easy victims of a Hollywood-staged, 3D virtual reality hologram show, orchestrating a “second coming”.  An electronically engineered “messianic figure” acting in sync with Elite global objectives?   Who would dare go against God himself?</p>
<p>12) Staged “Alien Contact.” This too may be in the works.  For decades, large sectors of world population have been programmed to believe in aliens.  Here too, hologram technology could stage a “space vehicle landing” – on the White House lawn, of course – highlighting the “need” for Mankind to have “unified representation” in the face of extraterrestrials.  Further justification for world government?<br />
What do such interlocking “crises” have in common? Global warming, pandemics, “international terrorism”, financial collapse, economic depression, even alien contacts?  They all serve to show that they cannot be addressed by any single nation state, thus “justifying” the need for World Government.<br />
2012: We must stay especially alert, understanding things the way they really are and not the way the global TV Masters want us to believe they are.</p>

<p>On October 27, Hillary Clinton gave an exclusive interview to the UK&#8217;s state-funded, state-run BBC Persian TV and in an attempt aimed at reaching out to the Iranian nation, made bombastic remarks which have certainly infuriated the Iranian nation and demonstrated that the hostile behavior and antagonistic stance of the U.S. government toward the Iranian nation is a manifestation of the idiom &#8220;the leopard can&#8217;t change its spots.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the interview, Clinton referred to the sanctions imposed against Iran by the U.S. and its European allies and said that these sanctions are targeted at forcing the Iranian government into abandoning its nuclear program which she called is an effort to construct nuclear weapons and not for civilian purposes. Forgetting the detrimental impacts of economic sanctions against the ordinary people, Clinton talked of the United States as a friend of the Iranian people, and said that she wanted to reaffirm her country&#8217;s &#8220;very strong support for and friendship toward the people of Iran.&#8221; She further added that the behavior of the United States towards the Iranian government is different from its behavior toward the Iranian people, and by saying that, she clearly paraded her diplomatic naiveté and artlessness. How do you justify enmity with a government which is democratically elected by a group of people which you claim of being supportive of?</p>
<p>Secondly, maybe Mrs. Secretary has forgotten that the U.S. itself is the largest possessor of nuclear weapons in the world. How can such a police state which has so far killed millions of people around the world, from Nagasaki and Hiroshima to Baghdad and Kabul, boast of its concerns about the development of nuclear bombs by a country which is the most pacifist country in a boiling and tumultuous region such as Middle East and hasn&#8217;t ever invaded nor attacked any country in the past century?</p>
<p>A Reuters report quoting U.S.officials revealed in May 2010 that the U.S. has an arsenal of 5,113 nuclear warheads. It is the only country which has used nuclear weapons in  warfare and the only nation that has conducted around 1,054 nuclear tests and developed many long-range weapon delivery systems. So, who is really entitled to be concerned? Shouldn&#8217;t the international community be anxious about the nuclear arsenal of the self-proclaimed superpower, the U.S.? Who may guarantee that the U.S. won&#8217;t use its nuclear weapons in the prospective wars which it will be waging in the future? If the criterion of imposing financial sanctions is the possession of nuclear weapons and pursuing the development of them, why shouldn&#8217;t the U.S. or its Middle East client state, Israel, which is the sole possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, be the target of sanctions? A report by Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis showed that between 1940 and 1996, the U.S.spent at least $8.15 trillion in present day terms on nuclear weapons development. Which country can be pinpointed on the world map which has invested in nuclear program, even for peaceful purposes, so enormously?</p>
<p>But it was not only Clinton&#8217;s deceptive bluffs on Iran&#8217;s nuclear program that seemed perplexing and ridiculous. She lived beyond her means by claiming that the international community is angry at what Iran is today and wants a better future for its people!</p>
<p>&#8220;But I would ask you to put yourself in the position of the international community and those who seek a better future inside Iran. If you do not want to have a conflict, if you do not want to just give way to behavior that is very reckless, as we saw in this recent plot against the Saudi ambassador, potentially dangerous, sanctions is the tool that we have at our disposal to use,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Clinton went on to raise the issue of the alleged terror plot against the Saudi ambassador in Washington and attributed this plot to Iran. She, however, certainly remembers that they were agents of the CIA, MI6 and Mossad in Iran that assassinated four Iranian nuclear scientists immediately after their names were put on the UNSC sanctions list. Wasn&#8217;t the assassination of Dariush Rezaei, Massoud Alimohammadi or the foiled assassination plot against Fereydoon Abbasi a conspicuous sponsorship of terrorism by a government which calls itself the number one defender of democracy and peace? Wasn&#8217;t awarding the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize to the President of such a country which murders and kills people with impunity some kind of degrading and humiliating this prestigious award?</p>
<p>But an interesting juncture in Clinton&#8217;s interview with the BBC was where a recorded video containing a question by one of the viewers of BBC was aired. The viewer asked Hillary Clinton about America&#8217;s perpetual adherence to double standards, its support for repressive regimes such as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, its backing of the dreadful coup d&#8217;etat against the democratic government of Iran&#8217;s then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 and its heinous shooting down of the Iran Air Flight 655 on July 3, 1988 which claimed the lives of 290 innocent passengers including 254 Iranians.Clinton was apparently taken aback by the question as her awkward response showed that the U.S.government has never found any way to account for its hypocritical policies and actions: &#8220;we have consistently spoken out about Bahrain and we have pushed the government to do more, and we support the independent investigation… We know that everything we have done in the course of our 235-plus year history is going to appeal to or be supported by everyone, and we take our history seriously. So, for example, we&#8217;ve expressed regret about what was done in 1953… And then we also have tried to point out that the tragedy of the shooting down of the airline is something that we deeply are sorry for, and we have said that repeatedly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it ludicrous? Shooting down a civilian aircraft, killing all the 290 people aboard and then simply saying that we are sorry? Overthrowing a democratic government which reflected the communal will of a nation and then simply saying that we are sorry? Waging wars and imposing sanctions which hurt the daily life of the ordinary people and saying that we are sorry?</p>
<p>Of course Hilary Clinton&#8217;s interview with BBC Persian was a fiasco and a political debacle. She just showed her lack of political finesse and once again brought to mind that the wolf may lose his teeth, but never his nature. Clinton is the representative of a country which throughout  history has repeatedly betrayed the Iranian nation. Perhaps expressing deepest apologies to the Iranian nation and changing their hostile attitude can be the first step which the American politicians should take in order to have the bitter memories of their mischievousness wiped off the minds of Iranian people.</p>

			<p><img src="http://www.gilad.co.uk/storage/israel-nuke%20wanderong.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320393064587" width="220" />It does not take a genius to gather that the Israeli aggression towards Iran would endanger every living species on this planet. Devastatingly enough, our Western governments  do nothing to stop the Jewish State. That should not take us by surprise: our politicians are largely funded and vetted by Israeli lobbies that openly support attack on Iran.</p>
<p>Here in Britain Defence Secretary Liam Fox had to resign two weeks ago when it became clear that he was ‘breaching ministerial laws’. The British press went out of its way to reduce the issue of his resignation into just another &#8216;gay-ish mini scandal&#8217;. But we actually have strong reason to believe that Fox was working intensively for Israel. He was enthusiastically advocating Israeli interests such as an <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/8293568/Liam-Fox-Iran-could-have-nuclear-weapons-next-year.html">attack on Iran</a>.  Together with his ‘best friend’ Adam Werritty,   he was also <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2011/10/18/the-sins-of-liam-fox/">funded by the Israeli lobby</a>. We  know also that Fox and his ‘flat mate’ Werritty were in direct contact with  Mossad, and were even <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/8844319/MI6-warned-Liam-Fox-over-Adam-Werritty-links.htmlhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/8844319/MI6-warned-Liam-Fox-over-Adam-Werritty-links.html">warned by MI6</a>about it.</p>
<p>But Fox was not alone: with 80% of our leading party’s MP&#8217;s being Conservative Friends Of Israel’s (CFI) members, <strong>we have good reason to believe that treachery is now institutional amongst UK elected politicians.</strong></p>
<p>As we brace ourselves while learning from the Israeli press about the <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4142862,00.html">IAF’s final preparations</a> ahead for an attack on Iran&#8217;s nuclear plants, I would like to share with you a short passage from <em>The Wandering Who.</em></p>
<p>In the following extract, I explore the exact genocidal scenario that Israeli pilots are now  training to accomplish, in these very days. As much as it is clear that our treacherous elected puppets will fail to restrain Israel, it is equally and tragically obvious that Israel lacks the means to restrain its own madness.</p>
<blockquote><p>“…I will try to elucidate this idea through a simple and hypothetical yet horrifying war scenario. We, for instance, can envisage a horrific situation in which an Israeli so-called ‘pre-emptive’ attack on Iran escalates into a disastrous nuclear war, in which tens of millions of people perish. I guess that amongst the survivors of such a nightmare scenario, some may be bold enough to argue that ‘Hitler might had been right after all.’</p>
<p>The above is obviously a fictional scenario, and by no means a wishful one, yet such a vision of a ‘possible’ horrific development should restrain Israeli or Zionist aggression towards Iran. As we know, Israeli officials threaten to flatten Iran rather too often. In practice, pre-TSD<a href="http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/gilad-atzmon-armageddon-ahead.html#_ftn1">[1]</a> Israelis make this devastating scenario into a possible reality.</p>
<p>Seemingly, Israelis and Zionist politicians fail to see their own actions in the light of history.  They fail to look at their actions in terms of their consequences. From an ethical perspective, the above  ‘imaginary’ scenario is there to prevent Israel from attacking Iran. Yet, as we all know, Israel and its lobbies are desperate to dismantle the so-called ‘Iranian threat’. My explanation is simple. The Jewish state and the Jewish discourse in general are completely foreign to the notion of temporality. Israel is blinded to the consequences of its actions, it only thinks of its actions in terms of short-term pragmatism. Instead of temporality, Israel thinks in terms of an extended present.” (<em>The Wandering Who</em>pg. 179)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Jewish State and its lobbies are the greatest threat to world peace.  If we want to save ourselves, there is no other way of doing so than looking closely into Jewish, Israeli and Zionist culture, identity and ideology. There is no other way of doing so than scrutinising Israel’s unique and relentless attitude towards lobbying.</p>
<p>The issues we are dealing with here are not solely political  they are actually deeply philosophical, psychological and sociological &#8211; and it is also about life and death.</p>

Despite its evidently make-believe facade, the cooked-up story of the Saudi envoy assassination plot does not seem to be something which can be easily banished from the minds of the American powers that be.</p>
<p>The heat over Iran in the US government is growing rapidly. Some Republican congressmen have expressed their interest in waging an all-out war against Iran, a threat they keep refreshing every time they have an excuse. They have clearly stated that Washington should not dismiss the idea of resorting to military force against Iran, an idea which is being strengthened in Congress.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think you should take it off the table,” Michigan Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, has said.</p>
<p>It is quite natural that he was vehemently supported by the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator John McCain, who have always maintained an antagonistic approach towards Iran.</p>
<p>Hawkish Gingrich said on CNN, “Our goal should be the replacement of the Iranian dictatorship, and we have done nothing of consequence to systematically undermine the regime.”</p>
<p>The US government keeps preaching at others and talking of dismantling this or that regime which they term as &#8216;dictatorial&#8217; or &#8216;sponsor of terrorism&#8217;. Now that the lot has fallen to the US government itself, they are at a loss and appear despondently desperate. The implosive voice that is eroding the American system from within cannot be easily smothered or contained.</p>
<p>Therefore, the US has to find a way to divert international attention from what is going on in the country and zoom in onIran. This can be one simple reason but it is very plausible. However, a bigger scenario is at work in collaboration with the Mossad and other intelligence services.</p>
<p>Soon, Washington&#8217;s political equation was abruptly disturbed when a top ISI official revealed that the man involved in the alleged assassination plot of the Saudi envoy Adel al-Jubeir had received forged documents from Mossad.</p>
<p>&#8220;The accused man [Mansour Arbabsiar] received fake ID documents from Mossad three months ago,&#8221; the Pakistani Urdu-language Ummat Daily quoted the Inter-Services Intelligence officer as saying on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>According to the Pakistani intelligence expert, the man in question was slated to carry out an operation code named Foss Fling for the notorious Israeli intelligence agency.</p>
<p>In parallel with this appalling revelation, The Independent ran a story about Adam Werritty, an unofficial “chief of staff” to British Defense Minister Liam Fox, his best man and former flat mate who accompanied him on a number of official visits and virtually made all his decisions and even held top level meetings. Things went wrong though when it became manifest that he had in February arranged a meeting between Fox and senior Mossad operatives at a security conference taking place in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, where they discussed effective plans to overthrow the &#8216;Iranian regime&#8217;. Werritty was said to have regularly met Iranian anti-government groups, Israeli operatives and right-wing US groups with an overwhelming interest in destabilizing President Ahmadinejad and overthrowing the Islamic government.</p>
<p>According to the report, Werritty had travelled to Iran on several occasions and held secret meetings with opposition groups with the express intention of expediting the fall of the Islamic government inIran. Interestingly, MI6 was informed of his connections and debriefed him after he returned from overseas trips.</p>
<p>Werritty was financially backed by murky sources such as Bicom, an Israeli advocacy organization based in theUK. Bicom which stands for Britain Israel Communications Research Center is in fact a front organization based inLondontasked with security and intelligence activities as well as promotion of Zionism. Apart from garnering support for the Zionist regime among Britons, the office also serves as a bridge between Mossad and MI6. The CEO of the office, Lorna Fitzsimons, a former MP, is noted for her constant support for the Zionists. She used to be a member of the campaign group, Labor Friends of Israel (LFI). It is basically a lobby group promoting Zionism within the British Labor Party in particular and in Britain, in general. And Werritty is an influential member of the organization and a highly regarded agent for Mossad.</p>
<p>These postulations aside, there has recently emerged an interesting piece of information about a second person held on suspicion of involvement in the alleged plot. The information reveals a man named Gholam Hussein Shakouri who is closely connected with the fabricated prime suspect. Shakouri, who is a cousin of Mansour Arbabsiar, is reportedly a member of the MKO, a notorious anti-Iranian terrorist organization now based at the Ashraf camp in Iraq and strongly supported by the US government although the organization has been widely designated as a terrorist organization. The MKO man has travelled to a number of countries with many fake IDs, including forged Iranian passports. He was last seen in Washington and at Camp Ashraf, where MKO members are based. One of the passports Shakouri used was issued on November 30, 2006 in Washington numbered K10295631. The terrorist organization MKO has more than 3,000 members at the camp. Members of the group have been involved in several assassination and sabotage activities in Iran.</p>
<p>The loosely-structured assassination plot is part of an extensive espionage and sabotage network supported and co-funded by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad and CIA.</p>
<p>The marriage of the pernicious intelligence agencies e.g. Mossad, CIA and MI6 in trying to sabotage and cripple the Islamic government indicates a diligently wrought out plan over many years and one which has been heavily funded.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, what seemed at first to be a simplistic effort by the US to corner Iran into political isolation has begun to branch out into ramifications of Kafkaesque proportions.</p>

				<p>October 14, 2011 by <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?author=1" title="Posts by Administrator" rel="author">Administrator</a> &middot; <a href="http://veracityvoice.com/?p=12519#respond" title="Comment on U.S. Playing The Saudi Envoy Game"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="12519 http://veracityvoice.com/?p=12519">Leave a Comment</span></a>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.novakeo.com/images/holderdoj3.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.novakeo.com/images/holderdoj2.jpg" alt="" /></a>In a &#8216;united against Iran campaign,&#8217; the US government has accused Tehran of orchestrating an assassination plot against the Saudi envoy in Washington, a move which is to be seen as part of a US stratagem to carry on with its plan of demonizing and isolating the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
<p>US Vice President Joe Biden said on &#8220;The Early Show&#8221; on Wednesday that &#8220;It&#8217;s critically important that we unite the world in the isolation of and dealing with the Iranians. That&#8217;s the surest way to be able to get results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, the US officials will use the fabricated occasion to press for new international sanctions as they say that Iranian agents have sought to hire a purported member of a Mexican drug cartel to assassinate the Saudi envoy on American soil.</p>
<p>Regardless of the impertinence and hollowness of the claim, one should not disregard the influence of the powerful Zionist lobby in the new mudslinging plan which is, as Iran&#8217;s Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani puts it, a &#8216;tactless and childish game.”</p>
<p>To add more fuel to Iranophobia, US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called on other countries to work together against what is becoming a clearer and clearer threat&#8221; from Iran and said, “This really, in the minds of many diplomats and government officials, crosses a line that Iran needs to be held to account for.”</p>
<p>Washington, once again, went on a labeling spree and called Iran “the world&#8217;s leading state sponsor of terrorism.”</p>
<p>There is well-grounded speculation that the new move is meant to stir up dissension in the region so that the US may bolster its waning influence among the Middle Eastern countries as Iran wields a great amount of political muscle in the region. In other words, the US will then be in a position to fish in troubled waters.</p>
<p>In concerted efforts with Israel, Washington has a long history of covert operations in Iran including cyber-terrorism, commercial sabotage and targeted assassinations. A notable instance of such operations is a computer worm known as Stuxnet which has hit Iranian nuclear facilities, categorically a deliberate attempt by the US government to destroy what Iranian scientists have reaped during years. The worm was reportedly tested in Israel at the notorious nuclear arsenal Dimona in a joint Israeli-American effort (The New York Times January 15, 2011). Ironically, Dimona which has been used as a testing ground for the worm, houses over 300 nuclear warheads, and was kept hidden for years until Mordechai Vanunu, a former technician at Dimona, fled to Britain in 1986 and revealed the Israeli nuclear program as well as a top-secret underground facility directly below the installation. Reports say that Israel has at its disposal material for roughly 20 hydrogen bombs and 200 fission bombs. Needless to say, Israel is not a global security threat despite its nuclear warheads and irresponsible behavior towards the Palestinians as it is a fawning ally of the USA.</p>
<p>Apart from sabotaging the nuclear program in Iran, Washington has shamelessly engaged in a series of assassinations against Iranian nuclear scientists. In July 2011, a university student named Daryoush Rezaei, 35, was shot down while his wife sustained serious injuries and was rushed to hospital. In 2010, Massoud Ali Mohammadi, a nuclear scientist, was killed by a remote-controlled bomb in Tehran. On November 29, 2010, two other scientists were targeted by bombs that hit their cars in the capital. The assailants, who were on motorcycles, had stuck magnetic bombs to the victims&#8217; cars. Professor Majid Shahriari was killed on the spot, but Dr. Fereydoun Abbasi and his wife sustained minor injuries and were taken to a hospital. A report carried by The Jerusalem Post citing French Weekly <em>Le Canard enchaine</em> revealed that Mossad had conducted the assassinations “with the help of the CIA and MI6.”</p>
<p>According to intelligence sources, the assassinations were part of Joint US-Israeli plots meant to sabotage Iran&#8217;s nuclear program. Also, an article published in the Portuguese-language Weekly, <em>The Expresso</em> revealed that high-ranking Mossad officials gathered at the spy agency&#8217;s headquarters in northern Tel Aviv, concluding that the killing of Shahriari would be Mossad&#8217;s last covert operation under its current director, Meir Dagan. However, the two spy agencies refused to assume any responsibility for the attacks whatsoever.</p>
<p>In the Iowa Republican Presidential Debate in August 2011, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich spurted out his brazen sloganeering against the Islamic republic and when asked about the situation in Libya, he unconsciously gave rein to his anger and started ranting about Iran, saying the nation had “gone on the offensive” against the USA and needed to be confronted. Soon other hawks joined in with former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty speaking venomously in favor of attacking Iran and boldly lauding the “good works” of the US government in assassinating Iranian scientists and the “good work” of creating the Stuxnet computer virus. This was how he let the cat out of the bag, making it clear that the USA was behind all those atrocities.</p>
<p>Some pundits believe that the US move will put Iran in the forefront of global hatred. This will never happen as the US and its lapdog Israel have already played similar games about Iran over and over again.</p>
<p>What the US government has done to the Iranian nation is not easy to forget and the support it keeps voicing for Israel is not difficult to digest.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it strange that Iran, which has long been a victim of US-sponsored terrorism and assassinations, should have become a target of threadbare allegations?</p>
